PROGRESS REPORT

Agenda Item 10 a

(Submitted by SCAR)
ATCM WORKING PAPER FROM SCAR AND COMNAP

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
PROGRESS REPORT TO XIX ATCM

Introduction

At ATCM XVII the recommendations of the First Meeting of Experts on Environmental Monitoring in Antarctica were discussed in detail. In adopting Recommendation XVII-1 the ATCM requested that both SCAR and COMNAP should provide advice on aspects of monitoring.

Specifically, SCAR were asked to provide advice on:

"The types of long-term programmes, if any, necessary to verify that human activities (such as tourism, scientific research or other activities) do not have significant adverse effects on birds, seals and plants"

whilst COMNAP were requested, in consultation with SCAR, to

"establish research programmes at a representative subset of facilities in Antarctica to determine how different types and sizes of facilities in different localities (e.g. coastal and inland stations on rocks and ice shelves) affect the Antarctic environment".

AT ATCM XVIII the SCAR and COMNAP proposal to convene technical workshops, as recommended in Recommendation 9 of the First Group of Experts Meeting, was accepted and terms of reference were proposed.

SCAR activities

SCAR passed the request to the Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation (GOSEAC) for consideration. During GOSEAC VI in Santiago, May 1994, the issue of monitoring was discussed in detail.

GOSEAC noted that priority impacts that needed monitoring were defined by the First Group of Experts Meeting as:

•   station and airstrip logistic operations
•   waste water and sewage
•   incineration of waste
•   power and heat generation
•   human impact on flora and fauna
•   scientific research
•   accidental fuel spills

GOSEAC examined the Environmental Protocol requirements for environmental monitoring and concluded that, as a minimum, monitoring is required in the following areas:

•   key environmental parameters of operations and activities (see above)
•   monitoring to assess impacts (see above)
•   monitoring required by any IEE/CEE
•   status of marine mammals
•   dispersion of discharged sewage
•   water management plans
•   significant changes or damage to ASMAs
Assessment of the significance of any change detected by monitoring will only be possible if baseline information is available from outside the studied areas.

COMNAP activities

During the COMNAP Meeting 1993 in Christchurch, a questionnaire was designed in which the Antarctic operators were asked to suggest stations to be monitored. These stations should be examples of variable location (coastal, inland), size, substrate, age, and occupation (year-round and summer only).

As a result, 26 stations were suggested by 15 countries. Moreover, it was stated that at many (if not most) sites, monitoring programmes do already exist.

During COMNAP in Rome, August/September 1994, an ad hoc group was formed with the task to make suggestions for courses of action to the COMNAP Plenary.

It was concluded that:
- at present it is premature to make suggestions on stations because what is "representative" still has to be defined.
- AMAP (the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) is developing a monitoring and assessment protocol which, at least in part, could be adopted for the Antarctic.

It was recommended that any monitoring framework should have two components:

i) basic monitoring to be conducted at as many stations as possible following standardized procedures. In selecting the parameters, the general relevance and feasibility of the monitoring programme should be borne in mind. The basic programme should be carried out at year-round stations.

ii) specialized monitoring at a small selection of stations. The choice of parameters need not be standardized, but the use of agreed protocols would make the data more useful.

After reaching agreement on the stations to be monitored, GOSEAC should define the basic parameters. As for the specialized monitoring programme, COMNAP should suggest stations to be included. Moreover, the following suggestions were made:
- The data acquisition programme should be supplemented by a long-term scientific baseline research programme with the objective of assessing the ecological impact of specific perturbations caused by station activities.
- The scientific baseline monitoring programme should also include biological data sets such as species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution to the greatest extent possible under the given circumstances.
- The environmental monitoring programme should follow standardized procedures at all sites in order to yield comparable data sets.

An ensuing enquiry to national operators yielded suggestions, but no list of stations and monitoring programmes can be furnished at this point. The suggestions include the following:
- basic parameters should be small in number and simple.
- specialized parameters need not be standardized, should be problem-oriented and can, at least in part, use sophisticated technologies.
- basic monitoring should, if at all possible, be conducted at all year-round stations.
- specialized monitoring should cover a range of station types as wide as possible as defined by COMNAP in Christchurch.
- In order to be able to implement monitoring programmes, clear statements of management and scientific objectives are still required, in order to allow operators to solicit funds for their respective monitoring programmes.

Technical workshops

Two technical meetings are scheduled at about a one-month interval with the task to finalize recommendations about monitoring programmes to SCAR and COMNAP. It is intended that the first workshop be held in Oslo in late September and the second one at College Station, Texas in late October 1995.

The first workshop will have the tasks:
- to define the priority of impacts that need monitoring
- to discuss the design of the monitoring framework
- to define minimum monitoring needs to meet requirements of the Protocol
- to define key variables to be monitored
- to assess baseline data requirements

The second workshop will have the following tasks:
- to agree on measurement methods for key variables
- to assess applicable technology
- to consider quality assurance of assessment techniques recommended
- to make recommendations on data management
- to define criteria for the assessment of monitoring programmes.

Both workshops will be open to all interested participants which should allow representation of all the groups suggested by ATCM XVIII in the Terms of Reference. It is intended that draft reports will be circulated to SCAR and COMNAP in early 1996 with the intention of bringing a final agreed version if possible to ATCM XX.
