MEASURES ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLE IX
OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

MEASURES ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLE IX OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY: EXPLANATORY NOTE

Background

1. A principal mechanism employed by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to regulate activities in Antarctica has been the use of measures adopted under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.

2. Paragraph 1 of Article IX provides that the Consultative Parties shall meet for the purpose of:

"formulating and considering, and recommending to their Governments, measures in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty".

Paragraph 4 of Article IX provides that measures:

"shall become effective when approved by all the [Consultative Parties] whose representatives were entitled to participate in the meetings held to consider those measures".

3. To date 18 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings have adopted 204 measures. A number of these have yet to be approved, and thus become effective, in accordance with paragraph 4.

4. Concerns have been expressed from both within and outside the Antarctic Treaty system over the precise status of measures.  Specifically these relate to:
(i)     their  jal effect (i.e. whether t' y are hortatory or mandatory);

(ii)    whether particular measures have, or have not,
        been approved in accordance with paragraph 4 and
        thus become effective; and

(iii)  whether, and if so which, measures are now
        outdated, having in some cases been superseded by
        subsequent instruments.

5. Problems relating to (iii) were raised at both the
XVI and XVII ATCMs by the Delegation of China (see XVI
ATCM/WP23 and XVII ATCM/WP15).  A comprehensive
revision of the relevance of existing measures remains
to be undertaken.

6. This paper does not however deal further with this
particular issue.  Instead it addresses specifically
points (i) and (ii) above.

(i) The legal effect of measures

7. There continues to be uncertainty as to the extent
to which measures create legal obligations.  Although
paragraph 4 provides for a measure to "become effective"
when approved by all the Consultative Parties, the terms
of measures vary.  Some contain language which is purely
hortatory in nature (e.g. "requests", "recommends",
"should") e.g. Recommendation XVII-I on Environmental
Monitoring and Data Management.  Others contain
mandatory language (e.g. "shall", "must", "agrees",
"decides").  Examples of the latter are the 1964 Agreed
Measures contained in Recommendation III - VIII, and
since transformed into Annexes of the
Environmental Protocol, namely Recommendations XIV-2,
XV-3 and XV-4 dealing with EIA, waste disposal and
marine pollution.  In addition, measures designating
Specially Protected Areas and introducing other
designations (e.g. Specially Reserved Areas under
Recommendation XV-10) have also been expressed partly in
mandatory language.
8. At the root of the problem is the extensive use of 
the procedure of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article IX for matters 
which were never intended to be legally binding; yet "measures" 
is the term more usually employed to describe something which 
is intended to be binding. Measures containing merely hortatory 
language are in the proper sense no more than suggestions as to 
how the Consultative Parties should act.  As such their force is 
political, not legal.

9. The problem may stem from the wording of paragraph 1 
which speaks of the Consultative Parties "recommending to their 
Governments _measures_"; and calling the means by which the 
measure is conveyed to Governments for their approval under 
paragraph 4 a "Recommendation". Use of that term in relation to 
measures which are intended to be legally binding as well as to 
those which merely contain suggestions, adds to the confusion.

10. In principle it seems unnecessary for a matter 
which is not intended to be legally binding to be subject to the 
lengthy approval procedure of paragraph 4.  If it is no more 
than a suggestion it would seem more appropriate for it to be 
expressed as such in a resolution or in the report of the ATCM.  
There is no need for it to be treated as a measure subject to the 
paragraph 4 procedure.  That procedure, which is analogous to 
ratification of a treaty, should be reserved for measures, 
properly so called, which are intended to be legally binding.

11. It is therefore proposed that:

    (a) Only a text which is intended to be legally binding 
should be subject to the procedure of Article IX, paragraphs 1 
and 4.

    (b) Such a text should use mandatory language.
(c) The text should be expressed as a Measure recommended to Governments in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article IX and subject to their approval in accordance with paragraph 4 of that Article; and should not be described as a "Recommendation".

(d) Any text not intended to be legally binding should be expressed in hortatory language and should either be in a resolution of the ATCM or noted in the report of the ATCM.

A draft decision embodying this proposal is attached (Annex I).

(ii) Whether Recommendations are effective

12. Approvals by Consultative Parties of Recommendations adopted by the ATCM are notified to the Depository Government.  In turn the Depository provides an update of the Recommendations which have been approved by all Consultative Parties, and are thus effective.  The last such tabulation provided to the XVIII ATCM by the Government of the United States is appended (Annex II).

13. This indicates that

-   many Recommendations, some dating back to the IIIrd ATCM (1964), are not yet effective;

-   none of the Recommendations adopted at and since the XVth ATCM (1989) are yet effective.

14. The conclusion is that there may be considerable delay in obtaining the necessary unanimous approval for Recommendations, even for those of a relatively innocuous, hortatory nature.  The major factor contributing to this delay appears to be the "opt-in"
mechanism required of each Government to notify its 
approval of a Recommendation.  It is unclear therefore 
whether, for those Recommendations not approved, 
Governments have taken an active decision not to so 
approve, or whether they are unaware of the procedures 
for approval, or whether there is simply delay.

Proposal

15.  (a) Working on the basis of a list prepared by the 
Depository of those Recommendations which have 
not yet been approved in accordance with 
paragraph 4 of Article IX, the Consultative 
Parties should agree which of those 
Recommendations:

     (i) are no longer needed
    (ii) are mandatory
   (iii) are hortatory.

(b) Mandatory Recommendations would remain subject 
to the paragraph 4 procedure.

(c) The hortatory Recommendations would be regarded 
as effective, though not, of course, legally 
binding.

(d) Agreement on which category each Recommendation 
falls into should be reached at the next ATCM.

Decisions

16.  It has been suggested also that decisions taken at 
the ATCM should take effect at the time specified in 
them.  The Antarctic Treaty does not provide, as such, 
for decisions taken by an ATCM.  Some decisions have up 
till now been expressed in the form of Recommendations 
but other decisions taken at an ATCM will most likely be 
recorded in the final Report.  Their importance 
and legal status will vary.  Some will be merely 
procedural.  But decisions taken unanimously or by
consensus by ' e Consultative Parties reg-ding the
application or interpretation of the Antarctic Treaty as
it applies to them may amount to an agreement binding in
international law between the Consultative Parties as to
the matter: see Article 31 (3) of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties.  In principle decisions take
effect when they are taken, unless it is clear from the
decision or otherwise that they are intended to take
effect at a later date.
ANNEX I

Draft Decision on Measures under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty

The Representatives of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties;

Taking into account the need to increase the efficiency and clarity of the decision-making processes within the ATCM;

Recognising the new factors which will increase the scope and responsibility of the ATCM, in particular the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the introduction of the Transitional Environmental Working Group, until such time as the Committee for Environmental Protection comes into being;

After a close examination of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.

Unanimously decide that:

1.      The procedure in paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty shall apply only to texts which contain provisions which are intended to be legally binding once they have been approved by all the Consultative Parties in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX.

2.      Such texts shall be described as "Measures recommended to Governments under Article IX" and shall state expressly that they are subject to approval in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX.

3.      Nothing in the foregoing shall prevent the Consultative Parties from adopting legally binding decisions regarding the interpretation or application of the Antarctic Treaty and related instruments, which enter into force on adoption or at such other time as may be specified.
4. When [?]re is nothing in a text w[?]h is intended to be legally binding, the text shall be expressed in hortatory language and shall be contained in a resoluton of a meeting of the Consultative Parties. Such text shall take effect on adoption or at such other time as may be specified.

5. The present decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.

ANNEX I

Draft Decision on Measures under Article IX of 
the Antarctic Treaty

The Representatives of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties;

Taking into account the need to increase the efficiency and 
clarity of the decision-making processes within the ATCM;

Recognising the new factors which will increase the scope and 
responsibility of the ATCM, in particular the Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the 
introduction of the Transitional Environmental Working Group, 
until such time as the Committee for Environmental Protection 
comes into being;

After a close examination of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article IX of 
the Antarctic Treaty.

Unanimously decide that :

1. The procedure in paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article IX of the 
Antarctic Treaty applies only to texts which contain 
provisions which are intended to be legally binding once 
they have been approved by all the Consultative Parties in 
accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX.

2. Such texts shall be described as "Measures recommended to 
Governments under Article IX" and shall state expressly that 
they are subject to approval in accordance with paragraph 4 
of Article IX.

3. The meetings of the Consultative Parties may also adopt 
legally binding decisions relating to procedural and 
organisational matters, which enter into force on adoption 
or at such other time as may be specified.

4. When there is nothing in a text which is intended to be 
legally binding, the text shall be expressed in hortatory 
language and shall be contained in a resolution of a meeting 
of the Consultative Parties. Such text shall take effect on 
adoption or at such other time as may be specified.

5. The present decision shall enter into force on the date of 
its adoption.
