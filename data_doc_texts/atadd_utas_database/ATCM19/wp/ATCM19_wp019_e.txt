THE NEED FOR OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS USED IN THE PROTOCOL TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY ON THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT

Item 6 of the Agenda
(submitted by Chile)

Introduction

The importance of preventing the degradation of the antarctic environment, including its dependant and associated ecosystems is widely recognized, in particular if this degradation is irreversible. It follows that there is an urgent need to comply with the terms of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on the Protection of the Environment. Accordingly any action to counteract possible or eventual difficulties in its implementat ion is highly recommendable.

In this sense, operational definitions of some of the terms used in the text, could be of great help. More so, these operational definitions should take into consideration the need for a gradual implementation of the Protocol, which could contemplate operational definitions more demanding with time until we can reach full compliance.

In some parts of the text of the Protocol there is reference to the "appropriate national procedures". We know that the legislation and norms applied to the deterioration of the environment varies from country to country, and in relation to different environmental problems and to different ecological characteristics of the territory to which it is applied. The operational definitions could contemplate common minimum requirements, applicable by all the Parties.

EXAMPLES OF CONVINIENT DEFINITIONS

The following are examples of terms used in the Protocol which, in our view, would need to be clarified, in the sense mentioned above, through "operational definitions".

1.- Antarctica is designated as a "special area of conservation". There is a tendency to assign different meanings to the terms "conservation of nature", including sometimes the connotation of "preservation of nature". This is not the case and therefore it is necessary to agree which meaning we shall give to that term in order to operate in Antarctica.

2.- What do we understand as "natural reserve" in the Antarctic?. What is and what would the characteristics be or will have the "system of Antarctic protected areas"?

3.- What should we understand as "adverse" effects in relation to the different antarctic ecosystems?

4. - Mention is made to the importance of "areas of biological, 
scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness significance".
What are the elements which determine or will determine in the 
future that there exists "biological or scientific 
significance", etc.?

5. - "Monitoring" (article 5, Annex 1). It would be convinient 
to define it operationaly indicating which types of procedures 
we mean. In relation to this term there exists a further 
complication to the spanish-speaking parties considering that 
in the spanish version of the Protocol it has been translated 
as "observation" which does not mean the same. In various 
multilateral fora in which environmental matters are dealt 
with -specially in the United Nations- monitoring has been 
translated with the neologism "monitoreo" or as "vigilancia 
ambiental".

6.- We find in the text, in various parts, "minimum or 
transitory impact" and it is not clear what is meant by both 
terms which should be defined operationaly so that they can be 
applied effectively.

7.- There are many more terms which would benefit enormously 
from operational definitions; for example "cumulative impacts" 
(article 6, d), "environmental emergencies" and "fundamental 
environmental indicators" (Article 5, Annex 1).

Proposal    

We propose that, on the basis of the terms of reference of the 
Transitional Environmental Working Group,  the  Plenary 
establishes a group of experts -hopefully with an expert for 
each Party- to determine, during the intersessional period, 
operational definitions of the terms found in the Protocol 
(those indicated and others that could be agreed to during the 
work of the TEWG). These definitions would be submitted to the 
XX Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty. The 
definitions must contain the criteria which the Parties should 
be applying even before entry into force of the Protocol, so 
that they can comply with the requirements contained therein. 
With the resulting terms, it would be necessary to consider 
the gradual application of the obligations contained in it.
