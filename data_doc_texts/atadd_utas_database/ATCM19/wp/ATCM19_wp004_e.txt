DRAFT MEASURE:

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM:
NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

Agenda Item 12 b

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)
Draft Measure
Antarctic Protected Area System:
New Historic Sites and Monuments

The Representatives,

Recalling the Measures in Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9,
XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8.

Recommend to their Governments the following Measure, subject to approval
in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty; That
the following historic monuments be added to the "List of Historic
Monuments Identified and Described by the Proposing Government or
overnments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9 and that thereafter they be
accorded the respect and protection required by the Recommendations
recalled the above.

a)  Port Lockroy, Base A, on Goudier Island, off Wiencke Island, Antarctic
    Peninsula (Lat 64° 49' S, Long 63° 31' W). Of historic importance as
    an Operation Tabarin base and for scientific research.

b)  Argentine Islands, Base F (Wordie House) South-west corner of Winter
    Island, one of the group known as the Argentine Islands (Lat 65°
    15' S, Long 64° 16'W). Of historic interest as an early Falkland
    Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) base.

c)  Horseshoe Island, Base Y, Marguerite Bay, West Graham Land (Lat 67°
    49' S, Long 67° 18'W). Noteworthy as a relatively unaltered and
    completely equipped base of the later FIDS period. Blaiklock, the
    refuge hut nearby, is taken to be an integral part of the base.

d)  Stonington Island, Base E, Northern end of Stonington Island,
    Marguerite Bay, West Graham Land (Long 68° 11' S, 67° 00' W). Of
    historical importance in the early period of exploration and later
    British Antarctic Survey (BAS) history of the 1960s and 70s.
Background Information

To provide a balanced view of the history of British science in the 
Peninsula region the best examples of bases have been identified for 
designation covering four distinct periods as follows:

Operation Tabarin, 1943-45
Port Lockroy, Base A, 1944

Early FIDS History, 1945-50
Argentine Islands (Wordie), Base F, 1947

Later FIDS History, 1951-63
Horseshoe Island, Base Y, 1957

BAS, 1963-present
Stonington Island, Base E, 1960

a)  PORT LOCKROY, BASE A

GENERAL:  Port Lockroy, Base A, consists of two buildings, the ruins of a 
third, and a radio mast.  The island is colonised by Gentoo penguins part of 
a large rookery that extends well back onto Wiencke Island.  The base was 
first occupied in 1944 and abandoned in 1962. Conservation work is to 
commence in the austral summer of 1995/96. Currently a specification for 
the necessary restoration work is being drawn up, following which a small 
workforce will be recruited and equipment and materials purchased. It is 
anticipated that the conservation team will be inserted by BAS shipping in 
January 1995 and withdrawn on completion of the work in March.  Guides will 
be provided for visitors in future years.

EVENTS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT THE BASE:
Bransfield House, built in 1944, was the first permanent British Government 
building within the Antarctic Treaty area, that is 60° south.

SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASE:  Lt Comdr J W S Marr, RNVR, 
Commander of FIDS (1902-1965) was the base leader at Port Lockroy in 1944. 
He was a botanist who "made outstanding contributions in the field of 
Antarctic research and marine biology".  (Polar Record No 82, pp 94-97).

Dr Ivan Mackenzie Lamb (1911-1990) was a member of the base team in 1944. 
He was a distinguished botanist and lichenologist (Polar Record No 159, 
p.343;  also Bryologist 94 (3), p315).

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT THE BASE:  Initially 
survey, geology, meteorology and botany.  From 1950 onwards, ionospheric 
research, which was transferred to Faraday when Port Lockroy closed.  The 
base played an important role in ionospheric research during IGY in 1957. 
It was one of the three FIDS bases to contribute to IGY.

b)  ARGENTINE ISLANDS, PART OF FARADAY, BASE F (WORDIE HOUSE)

GENERAL:  The sole building at Argentine Islands, Base F, is Wordie House. 
It is a very early one in FIDS history, being established on 7 January 1947 
on the site of the 1935-36 British Graham Land Expedition hut.  The site 
includes the main base hut, with a met screen to its east and a flag pole 
equidistant to the west.

SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASE:  The hut is named after 
J M Wordie, chief scientist on Shackleton's 1914-17 Trans-Antarctic 
Expedition.
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT THE BASE:  Meteorological 
data was recorded at Wordie from 1947. The data collection system was 
standardised in 1950 with observations recorded over a 24 hour period.  
These are still carried out from Faraday Station on nearby Galindez Island, 
and they form one of the longest meteorological data sets in Antarctica.

c)     HORSESHOE ISLAND, BASE Y

GENERAL:  Horseshoe Island, Base Y, was established in 1955. It is sited 
on a promontory on the west side of Horseshoe Island, beside Sally Cove.  
The base consists of four buildings, several masts and boats. There is a 
memorial cross at the western end of the site erected to the memory of 
three men lost on the Dion Islands. It is a good representative base, 
retaining all main features of a base of the 1950s, including ancillary 
buildings. Also particularly important because of the completeness of the 
interior and base equipment, including all kitchen utensils, stocks of food 
and fuel, workshop tools, radio equipment, generator and other gear.  The 
base closed in 1960.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT THE BASE:  Survey, geology 
and meteorology were carried out over a period of five years.

d)     STONINGTON ISLAND, BASE E

GENERAL:  Stonington Island was the first base set up by FIDS after 
Operation Tabarin was disbanded. It was initially occupied in February 
1946, but none of the buildings of this early period remain. They were 
used as a source of materials for later building on the base. Two 
buildings stand today. The bitch and pup pens at Stonington Island are 
extensive, providing a graphic reminder of the importance of dogs at the 
base. In its heyday up to 150 dogs were at Stonington at any one time, 
making it the main sledging base for FIDS/BAS. The base finally closed in 
1975.

EVENTS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT THE BASE:

1946/47
Liaison with American personnel of Ronne's Antarctic Research Expedition 
(RARE) is perhaps the first time there was serious collaboration in the 
Antarctic between Britain and the USA.

27 October 1947
Sledge party set out from Stonington to meet and guide back the first party 
to sledge overland (in 71 days) from Hope Bay; they met at Three Slice 
Nunatak.

Fossil bluff established overland.

Between February 1947 and February 1950 a group known as the "Lost Eleven" 
spent three consecutive winters at the base.

SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASE:  Vivian Fuchs was Commander of 
FIDS and was based at Stonington for the two years 1948 and 1949.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT THE BASE:  Survey, 
geology, meteorology and biology.
