EXTENSION OF MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST NO. 16 AND 17

Australia advises delegations that the management plans for Sites of Special Scientific Interest No. 16 and 17, North-East Bailey Peninsula and Clarke Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, specify that the designations expire on 31 December 1995.

The management plans for the sites have not yet been submitted to SCAR for review. Australia is in the process of revising the management plans and rewriting them in the ASMA format, and will submit them to SCAR XXIV in August 1996. If the designations are allowed to expire in December 1995, there will be no protection for these sensitive and scientifically valuable areas close to Casey Station.

The Australian delegation recommends that the expiry dates for the management plans be extended to 30 June 1997, so that the current management plans remain in force until the revised plans have been submitted to SCAR XXIV and ATCM XXI, and any required amendments made.

A precedent for extension of management plans without review by SCAR exists: at ATCM XII a number of management plans, which would otherwise have expired, were extended to allow SCAR to review them before ATCM XIII.
