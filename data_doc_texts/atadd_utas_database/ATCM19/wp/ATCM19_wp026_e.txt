ATCM WORKING PAPER
ECOSYSTEM MATRICES

Introduction

In 1992 SCAR reported to ATCM XVII that, during a joint SCAR/IUCN Workshop on Protected Areas, work had begun on revision of the ecosystem classification system. This was originally developed by SCAR to assist in identifying areas that might be useful for inclusion in the Antarctic Protected Area System. The Meeting Report from ATCM XVII noted that "the classification system might be useful to the parties for deciding, and to the CEP for providing advice on, measures necessary to meet the requirements of Article 3(2) of Annex V of the Protocol, which specifies that the Parties shall seek to include certain types of areas in the series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas."

At ATCM XVIII SCAR reported further progress with ecosystem classification matrix and indicated that it would be presented at ATCM XIX.

SCAR Ecosystems Classification Matrix

The three matrices for marine, terrestrial and inland water ecosystems were first published in the report of the SCAR Working Group on Biology in 1976. They figured again in a report presented by SCAR to ATCM XIV 1987 and were used by Bonner and Smith (1985) in their volume "Conservation Areas in the Antarctic". The matrices were further revised by Smith (1994) in his account of the environmental-geographical basis of the Protected Areas System (In: Developing the Antarctic Protected Areas System - Proceedings of the SCAR/IUCN Workshop on Antarctic Protected Areas, Cambridge, UK, 29 June-2 July 1992).

At present there are 19 Specially Protected Areas and 35 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. In geographical terms 30 of these sites lie in or around the Antarctic Peninsula, with a further 15 on the east side of the Ross Sea. There are no sites in Marie Byrd Land and only nine sites for almost the whole of eastern Antarctica.

To date, relatively few countries have proposed Protected Area sites in the Antarctic. The three matrices demonstrate that considerable numbers of habitat types are not currently represented within the Protected Area system. Annex V, Article III of the Protocol lists a series of criteria to be used in identifying Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, but there are other useful criteria that may help in guiding the selection of specific sites:
a.    species distribution
b.    biodiversity
c.    rarity of habitat
d.    uniqueness of ecosystem or community
e.    special physical features, e.g. geothermal activitiy

The paper by Smith (op. cite) lists in Appendix 1 some regions where new ASPAs might be designated, together with reasons why.

Recommendation

Recognising the considerable development in ecosystem research in the Antarctic and noting the value of the ecosystem matrices in considering the distribution in representativeness of Antarctic Protected Areas,
SCAR recommends that the revised matrices for Terrestrial Rreshwater and Marine Ecosystems attached here be accepted as the best available summaries in any considerations of the development for the Protected Area system.
