ATCM WORKING PAPER FROM SCAR

FORMAT OF MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR PROTECTED AREAS

Introduction

The report from ATCM XVII noted that, when Annex V of the Protocol enters into force all SPAs and SSSIs designated as such by past ATCMs will need to be redesignated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. The Meeting agreed that the Parties which originally proposed the existing SSSIs and SPAs should review their Management Plans and be prepared to submit proposed revisions for consideration when the Protocol enters into force. The Meeting also agreed that SCAR should be asked to provide assistance in review and revision of Management Plans. to conform with the provisions of the Protocol.

In the report of ATCM XVIII SCAR is requested to consider how the format of Management Plans written to conform to Annex V could be developed to facilitate the use of the plans by all scientific and logistic personnel.

Consideration by SCAR

SCAR referred these requests to the Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation (GOSEAC). GOSEAC carefully studied the requirements of Annex V to determine the mandatory requirements for all Management Plans for ASPAs and reviewed a number of different formats in terms of simplicity of presentation and ease of use.

An exemplar site was chosen and a new Management Plan conforming to Annex V was prepared for this site. This was submitted to SCAR XXIII Delegates Meeting in Rome in 1994 and endorsed as an exemplar format.

Recommendation

Responding to the requests made by ATCM XVII and ATCM XVIII that SCAR should assist parties in reviewing and revising Management Plans to conform with the provisions of the Protocol and consider how the format could be developed to facilitate the use of plans by all scientific and logistic personnel,

Recognising that a uniform format for all Management Plans would assist in the ease of their drafting, and that the elimination of repetition and redundancy would make them easier to use,

SCAR recommends that: the format exemplified in Annex 1 should be adopted for all revised and new Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
Management Plan
for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 13

MOE ISLAND, SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS

1. Description of Values to be Protected

The Area was originally designated in Recommendation IV-13 (1966, SPA No 13) after a proposal by the United Kingdom on the grounds that Moe Island provided a representative sample of the maritime Antarctic ecosystem, that intensive experimental research on the neighbouring Signy Island might alter its ecosystem and that Moe Island should be specially protected as a control area for future comparison.

These grounds are still relevant. Whilst there is no evidence that research activities at Signy Island have significantly altered the ecosystems there, a major change has occurred in the low-altitude terrestrial system as a result of the rapidly expanding Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) population. Plant communities on nearby Signy Island have been physically disrupted by trampling by fur seals and nitrogen enrichment from the seals' excreta has resulted in replacement of bryophytes and lichens by the macro-alga Prasiola crispa. Low-lying lakes have been significantly affected by enriched run-off from the surrounding land. So far Moe Island has not been invaded by fur seals to any great extent and its topography makes it less likely that seals will penetrate to the more sensitive areas.

The values to be protected are those associated with the biological composition and diversity of a near-pristine example of the maritime Antarctic terrestrial and littoral marine ecosystems. In particular, Moe Island contains the greatest continuous expanses of Chorisodontium-Polytrichum moss turf found in the Antarctic. Moe Island has been visited on few occasions and has never been the site of occupation for periods of more than a few hours.

2. Aims and Objectives

Management of Moe Island aims to:

•   avoid major changes to the structure and composition of the terrestrial vegetation, in particular the moss turf banks,

•   prevent unnecessary human disturbance to the Area,

•   permit research of a compelling scientific nature which cannot be served elsewhere, particularly research related to determining the differences between the ecology of an undisturbed island and that of an adjacent occupied and fur seal perturbed island.

3. Management Activities

Ensure that the biological condition of Moe Island is adequately monitored, preferably by 
non-invasive methods, and that the sign-boards are serviced.

If fur seals were to gain access to the interior of Moe Island it would be necessary to take 
action to prevent damage to the vulnerable moss banks. This action would most likely 
consist of the erection of a seal-proof fence at the head of the gully at the northeast of 
Landing Cove. Any direct management activities in the Area would be subject to an 
environmental impact assessment before any decision to proceed is taken.

4. Period of Designation

Designated under ATCM Recommendation IV-13 for an indefinite period.

6. Description of the Area

6(i) Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features

Moe Island, South Orkney Islands, is a small irregularly-shaped island lying 300 m off the 
southwestern extremity of Signy Island, from which it is separated by Fyr Channel. It is 
about 1.8 km from the northeast to southwest and 1 km from northwest to southeast. Its 
position on Admiralty Chart No 1775, latitude 60°44’S, longitude 45°45’W, does not 
agree closely with that in Map 2 (lat. 60°44’S, long. 45°41’W).

The island rises precipitously on the northeastern and southeastern sides to Snipe Peak 
(226 m altitude). There is a subsidiary summit above South Point (102 m altitude) and 
lower hills on each of three promontories on the western side above Corral Point (92 m), 
Conroy Point (89 m) and Spaull Point (56 m). Small areas of permanent ice remain on 
the east- and south-facing slopes with late snow lying on the steeply dipping western 
slopes. There are no permanent streams or pools.

The rocks are metamorphic quartz-mica schists, with occasional biotite and quartz-rich 
beds. There is a thin bed of undifferentiated amphibolite on the northeastern coast. Much 
of the island is overlain with glacial drift and scree. Soils are predominantly immature 
deposits of fine to coarse clays and sands intermixed with gravels, stones and boulders. 
They are frequently sorted by freeze-thaw action in high or exposed locations into 
small-scale circles, polygons, stripes and lobes. There are deep accumulations of peat (up 
to 2 m thick on western slopes), considerable expanses of the surface of which are bare 
and eroded.
The dominant plant communities are Andreaea-Usnea fellfield and banks of
Chorisodontium-Polytrichum moss turf (the largest known example of this community type
in the Antarctic). These moss banks constitute a major biological value and the reason for
the designation of the Area. The cryptogamic flora is diverse.

The mites Gamasellus racovitzai and Stereotydeus villosus and the springtail Cryptopygus
antarcticus are common under stones.

There were five colonies of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) totalling about
11,000 pairs in 1978-79. A more recent visit (February 1994) noted fewer than 100 pairs
on the northern side of Landing Cove and more than a thousand on the southern side.
Numerous other birds breed on the island, notably about 2000 pairs of cape petrels
(Daption capensis) in 14 colonies (1966) and large numbers of Antarctic prions
(Pachyptila desolata).

Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are found
in the bays on the west side of the island. Increasing numbers of fur seals (Arctocephalus
gazella), mostly juvenile males, come ashore on the north side of Landing Cove and have
caused some damage to vegetation in that area. However, it is possible that the nature of
the terrain will restrict these animals to this small headland where damage may intensify.

6(ii) Restricted zones within the Area

None.

6(iii) Location of structures within the Area

A marker board is located at the back of the small shingle beach in the northeast corner of
Landing Cove, beyond the splash zone on top of a flat rock, to which it is bolted. The
board was erected on 2 February 1994.

There is a cairn and the remains of a survey mast, erected in 1965-66, on Spaull Point.
This mast is of interest for lichenometric studies and should not be removed. There are
no other structures on Moe Island.

6(iv) Location of other Protected Areas within close proximity

SPA No 14, Lynch Island, lies about 10 km north-north-east of Moe Island. SPA No 18,
North Coronation Island, lies about 19 km away on the northern side of Coronation Island.
SPA No 15, Southern Powell Island, is about 41 km to the east.

7. Permit Conditions

Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by appropriate
national authorities as designated under Article 7 of Annex V of the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

3
Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:

-   it is issued only for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere

-   the actions permitted will not jeopardize the natural ecological system in the Area

-   any management activities are in support of the objectives of the Management Plan

-   the actions permitted are in accordance with this Management Plan

-   the Permit, or an authorized copy, must be carried within the Specially Protected Area

-   a report or reports are supplied to the authority or authorities named in the Permit.

7(i) Access to and movement within the Area

There are no restrictions on landing from the sea, which is the preferred method. No special access points are specified, but landings are usually most safely made at the northeast corner of Landing Cove.

Helicopter landings should be avoided where practicable. Helicopters may land only on the col between hill 89 m and the western slope of Snipe Peak. To avoid overflying bird colonies approach should preferably be from the south, though an approach from the north is permissible.

It is forbidden to overfly the Area below 250 m altitude above the highest point except for access to the landing point specified above.

No pedestrian routes are designated but persons on foot should at all times avoid disturbances to birds or damage to vegetation and periglacial features. Vehicles are prohibited on Moe Island.

7(ii) Activities which are or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place

-   Compelling scientific research which cannot be undertaken elsewhere and which will not jeopardize the ecosystem of the Area

-   Essential management activities, including monitoring

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures

No structures are to be erected in the Area, or scientific equipment installed, except for essential scientific or management activities, as specified in the Permit.

7(iv) Location of field camps

Parties should not normally camp in the Area. If this is essential for reasons of safety, tents should be erected having regard to causing the least damage to vegetation or disturbance to fauna.

7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area

No living animals or plant material shall be deliberately introduced into the Area.

No poultry products, including food products containing uncooked dried eggs, shall be taken into the Area.

No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area. Any other chemicals, which may be introduced for a compelling scientific purpose specified in the Permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.

Fuel, food and other materials are not to be depoted in the Area, unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the Permit has been granted. All such materials introduced are to be removed when no longer required. Permanent depots are not permitted.

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora and fauna

This is prohibited, except in accordance with a Permit. Where animal taking or harmful interference is involved this should be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica, as a minimum standard.

7(vii) Collection and removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit-holder

Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a Permit, except that debris of man-made origin may be removed from the beaches of the Area and dead or pathological specimens of fauna or flora may be removed for laboratory examination.

7(viii) Disposal of waste value

All non-human wastes shall be removed from the Area. Human waste may be deposited in the sea.

7(ix) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan continue to be met

Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and site inspection activities, which may involve the collection of small amounts of plant material or small numbers of animals for analysis or audit, to erect or maintain notice boards, or protective measures.
