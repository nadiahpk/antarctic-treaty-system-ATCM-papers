INSPECTION CHECKLISTS

Background

At the XVIII ATCM an inspection checklist for permanent stations 
and associated installations was agreed.  The Meeting recognised 
that it would be useful to develop further checklists.

The UK offered to coordinate the production of checklists for 
vessels, abandoned stations, aircraft, refuges and waste dumps 
for discussion at the XIXth ATCM.

In this respect the UK has prepared draft checklists for vessels 
and abandoned stations and these are attached. It is also 
understood that the Delegation of Australia has prepared a draft 
checklist for inspection of waste dumps. As far as the UK 
Delegation is aware checklists dealing with inspection of 
aircraft and refuges have still to be addressed.
