ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
CIRCULATION OF INFORMATION

Agenda Item 11-a

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT:  CIRCULATION OF INFORMATION

Working Paper (Submitted by the United Kingdom)

Introduction and Background

1. Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty deals with Environmental Impact Assessment.  It requires that both draft and final Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs) shall be made publicly available, and circulated to the Parties and to the Committee on Environmental Protection.

2. For Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs), Article 6 (1) to Annex I requires that an annual list of any Initial Environmental Evaluations prepared in accordance with Article 2, and any decisions taken in consequence thereof shall be circulated by each Party to the other Parties, forwarded to the Committee on Environmental Protection and made publicly available.

3. Despite these requirements it will be difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of the scale and trend of activities and developments in Antarctica.  To achieve such an overview, a collated and comprehensive list of IEEs (and CEEs) needs to be published annually in an easily accessible form.

4. At the XVIII ATCM (Kyoto, April 1994) this issue was discussed (see para 99 of the Report). It was recommended that SCAR should publish an annual directory of any EIAs notified to SCAR.  This was on the understanding that the arrangement to collate and publish EIAs would be an interim arrangement until such time as the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is established.

5. However, the arrangement recommended at the XVIII ATCM is liable to produce a less than complete picture of the EIAs prepared in any one year, as there is no obligation on Parties to supply the required information.

mgr/3356.1
6. It is therefore proposed that to overcome this problem, achieve consistency and to meet the obligation for circulation of information set out in Article 6 (1) of Annex I to the Environmental Protocol, each Contracting Party should submit to the host government of the next ATCM, a list of the IEEs (and CEEs) prepared, and decisions taken on them during the preceding calendar year. That information should be submitted in a standard form, and by a prescribed date, ahead of the start of the next Consultative Meeting. Once the secretariat is established the list would be submitted to it.

7. Thereafter the collated list of IEEs (and CEEs) should be published as an Annex to the final Report of the ATCM.

/ 8. A draft Resolution to this effect is attached.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT:  CIRCULATION OF INFORMATION

The Representatives,

Recalling Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and
Articles 3,6 (2) and 17 of the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that numerous recommendations of Consultative Meetings have
established requirements for exchange of information between
Governments;

Noting also that Annex 1 to the Protocol creates further
obligations to exchange information annually, including
information on Initial Environmental Evaluations and Comprehensive
Environmental Evaluations;

Desirous that such information should be easily accessible and in
a comprehensive and uniform format so that the scale and trend of
activities and developments in Antarctica can be readily
monitored;

Recommend that:-

1. The Governments of the Consultative Parties should provide,
through diplomatic channels, a list of the Initial Environmental
Evaluations and Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations submitted
to them during the preceding calendar year;

2. The list should be transmitted to the host Government of the
next ATCM not later than 1 March;

3. The list should, at minimum, contain the following
information: A short description of the development or activity;
the type of environmental impact assessment undertaken
(preliminary, IEE or CEE); the location (name, latitude, and
longtitude) of the activity; the organisation responsible for the
EIA; and the decision taken following consideration of the
environmental impact assessment;

mgr/3356.3
4. The lists should be collated by the host Government of the ATCM and circulated as an information paper to the ATCM and thereafter, if the ATCM so agrees, be published as an Annex to the final Report of the ATCM.

5. The above procedures should be reviewed following the establishment of a permanent Secretariat.
