TOURISM AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES
IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

Agenda Item 7 a

(Submitted by Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and the United Kingdom)

===============================================================
TOURISM AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES 
IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

Introduction

At ATCM XVIII the Parties recognised the increase in tourist and non-Governmental activity in Antarctica, and the potential impact that this might have on the Antarctic environment, and consequently adopted Recommendation XVIII-1 ("Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic" and "Guidance for those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic").

The effective management and monitoring of tourism and non-Governmental activities in Antarctica can only be achieved by the collation and analysis of systematically collected data. Furthermore, if these data were compiled in a standardised fashion and were readily accessible in an international database, the Parties and other concerned groups would then be better able to develop tourism policies on the basis of "information sufficient to allow prior assessments of, and informed judgements about, ... possible impacts on the Antarctic environment" (Madrid Protocol, Article 3.2(c)).

Current data collection practice

Through the work of the United States National Science Foundation, a substantial set of data on non-governmental visits to Antarctica has been compiled for a number of years. These data are the best currently available, but they omit some ship, airborne and yacht-based expeditions arising from a number of non-US countries.

A number of countries, including (but not limited to) Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Germany, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States have needs for data on tourist and non-Governmental activities in Antarctica, and over the years some of these countries have developed formats for data collection of their own. Despite differences in the forms that have evolved, there is much common ground in the data being sought.

The value of a standardised data reporting format

Potentially onerous demands for data from many sources may be placed on expedition organisers. There are some concerns within the tour industry over the duplication in data being requested and the current lack of an internationally coordinated system for data gathering.

The question of systematic data collection on Antarctic tourism was considered by Parties at ATCM XVIII. Recommendation XVIII-1 encourages tour operators to report a range of data in Advance Notification and subsequent to their activities. While Recommendation XVIII-1 provided useful guidelines on those data considered valuable, it did not provide a standard format for the reporting of such data.
2

Toward the development of an international standard data reporting format

In June 1993 the International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research (ICAIR)
(an independent and international centre specialising in data and information handling) began
development of a prototype of an international Antarctic tourism database. ICAIR developed
a trial form for the collection of tour/expedition data, based on but extending the form already
in use by the US National Science Foundation. This trial form was prepared in collaboration
with a wide range of individuals, including Antarctic managers, environmental officers and the
tour industry. This trial form was tested in the Antarctic in 1993-94 and subsequently IAATO
table[d] a modified version in an Information Paper at the 1994 Kyoto ATCM.

In September 1994 with support from two Antarctic Treaty Parties, ICAIR undertook
further, and broader, consultation among interested groups. ICAIR contacted 87 individuals
world-wide involved in Antarctic tourism, the majority from Consultative Parties. These
included 54 representatives of Government organisations, 20 representatives from the Antarctic
tour industry and 13 non-Governmental organisations and independent observers. Responses,
some very detailed, were received from about half of those contacted.

As a result, a revised format was developed for field trial on a voluntary basis by
Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, The Netherlands, and South Africa, for
voluntary completion by tour operators in the 1994-95 season. Further comments received after
this season resulted in ICAIR working with individuals from New Zealand, the United Kingdom,
the United States and the tour industry simplifying the Reporting format in conjunction with a
format for Advance Notification. These are the forms attached to this Working Paper.

Proposed format for Advance Notification and Reporting of Tourist and non-Governmental
activities in Antarctica

The forms resulting from this extensive, almost 2-year, consultation process are attached
to this Working Paper in Attachments A and B. The format proposed follows closely those data
already noted as of value in Recommendation XVIII-1. It is hoped that this work will enable
Consultative Parties to agree on the data that need to be collected and the appropriate standard
format for that collection.

Conclusion

The attention of Treaty Parties is drawn to:

•       the importance of data to enable coordination, management and monitoring of 
        tourist and non-Governmental activities in the Antarctic;

•       the value of coordination and standardisation in the collection of data;

•       the current lack of a fully internationally coordinated data system on tourist and 
        non-Governmental activities in the Antarctic;

•       the value of ensuring that tour organisers and non-Governmental expeditions do 
        not experience duplication or undue difficulties when collecting or submitting 
        such data;

•       the desirability of working towards the compilation of data into a consistent, 
        comparable and internationally accessible database that is assured in data quality;

•       a draft format for Advance Notification and for Reporting on Tourist and 
        non-Governmental activities provided in Attachments A and B to this paper.
