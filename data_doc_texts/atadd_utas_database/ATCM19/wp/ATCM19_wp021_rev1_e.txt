THE ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREAS SYSTEM

Whalers Bay on Deception Island

Captain Adolfo Andresen was born in Sandnessjoen, a Norwegian town located at latitude 
66°North, and if he had no difficulty going to live in the town of Punta Arenas, latitude 52° 
South, his Antarctic settlement on Deception Island (62° latitude South) in 1906 was even more 
like his original surroundings.

This Norwegian-Chilean citizen pioneered a route of exploration and investigation in the 
Antarctic, an example followed by many of his fellow-countrymen, as the English historian Mr 
Robert Fox recounts in his book "Antarctica and the South Atlantic", London, 1985, p. 183: 
"The land station (on Deception Island), started by the Chileans and continued by the 
Norwegians..."

The constructions still standing were built in the early 20th century and were in use until 
the Second World War. There are still substantial remains today, as a testimony to future 
generations.

Those buildings are in themselves a fine reminder of the activity of man in the Antarctic 
in the early years of this century, but they need to be conserved and, if possible, restored to 
provide a worthy setting for the monument to Andresen which has already been approved.

Deception Island was shaken by a series of volcanic eruptions in 1967 and 1968, but the 
buildings were not seriously damaged or destroyed thanks to their sturdy construction. However, 
the graveyard was buried under a layer of ash and lava, though a few remains still mark the 
spot.

Proposed Resolution

The Representatives,

    Recalling resolutions I-9, V-4, VI-14 and VII-9;

    Recalling resolution XVI-11 which authorises the construction of a monument to the 
memory of Adolfo Andresen at Whalers Bay on Deception Island.

Recommend to their governments:

    That the following monument be added to the list of "Historical Monuments Identified 
and Described by the government or governments proposing", as annex to recommendation 
VII-9, and that, consequently, it be granted the respect and protection required by the above-
mentioned recommendations.

Monument No. -------------/, a group of constructions, boats, water tanks, boilers and

Whalers Bay on Deception Island

Captain Adolfo Andresen was born in Sandnessjoen, a Norwegian town located at latitude 
66° North, and he went to live in the town of Punta Arenas, latitude 52° South. His Antarctic 
settlement on Deception Island (62° South) in 1906 was at a latitude even more similar to his 
original surroundings.

This Norwegian-Chilean citizen pioneered a route of exploration and investigation in the Antarctic, an example followed by many of his fellow-countrymen, as the English historian Mr Robert Fox recounts in his book "Antarctica and the South Atlantic", London, 1985, p. 183: 
"The land station (on Deception Island), started by the Chileans and continued by the Norwegians..."

The constructions still standing were built in the early 20th century and were in use until the Second World War. There are still substantial remains today, as a testimony to future generations.

Those buildings are in themselves a fine reminder of the activity of man in the Antarctic in the early years of this century, but they need to be conserved and, if possible, restored to provide a worthy setting for the monument to Andresen which has already been approved.

Deception Island was shaken by a series of volcanic eruptions in 1967, 1969 and 1970, but the buildings described here were not seriously damaged or destroyed. However, the graveyard was buried under a layer of ash and lava, though a few remains still mark the spot.
