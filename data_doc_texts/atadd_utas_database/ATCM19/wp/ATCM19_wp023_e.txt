WASTE DUMP INSPECTION CHECKLIST

Background

As noted in Working Paper 2 submitted by the United Kingdom, at ATCM XVIII it was agreed that a number of further inspection checklists should be developed.

Australia has prepared a draft checklist for inspection of waste dumps, which is attached.
ANTARCTIC INSPECTION CHECKLISTS

CHECKLIST D

WASTE DUMPS

Observers may not be able to undertake the detailed inspection of a waste dump due, for example, to poor weather, ice and snow cover, time constraints or lack of expertise. In such circumstances, observers should bear in mind that the National Antarctic Program responsible for a waste dump can usually supply all, or much of, the information required by the checklist, and can also corroborate any data collected during an inspection.

1 GENERAL INFORMATION
  1.1 Name of site (if any)
  1.2 Location (geographical coordinates)
  1.3 Nation responsible for site, if known
  1.4 History of use of the site (where known)

2 INSPECTION DETAILS
  2.1 Date
  2.2 Time of visit
  2.3 Duration of visit
  2.3 Last inspection (nation(s), date)

3 PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF WASTE DUMP
  3.1 Topographical description of dump site (include area covered)
  3.2 Means of access to the site, winter and summer
  3.3 Details of drainage pattern and areas of water around dump, including distance of the site from sea and freshwater bodies
  3.4 Is the site marked? How?
  3.5 Has the dump been covered by soil or rock?
  3.6 Description of flora near dump
  3.7 Description of fauna near the dump (seabird colonies, skua and other scavengers' nests, seal haul-out sites)
  3.7 Scientific research carried out near the dump
  3.8 Weather regime for the site
  3.9 Estimate of total area and volume of dump
  3.10 Means of containment
  3.11 Age and state of contents
  3.12 Description of substrate of dump
4 CONTENTS OF WASTE DUMP (IF KNOWN)
  4.1 Summary description of contents
  4.2 Are there any unused or unusable buildings at the site?
  4.3 Is any information available on previous assessments of the 
      contents of the dump?
  4.4 Types and quantities, including means and condition of 
      containment, of:
        a    radioactive materials
        b    electrical batteries
        c    fuel (both liquid and solid) and lubricants
        d    wastes containing harmful levels of heavy metals or acutely 
             toxic or harmful persistent compounds
        e    polyvinyl chloride (PVC), foam, polystyrene, rubber, plastics
        f    treated wood
        g    fuel drums
        h    other hazardous materials (medical wastes, broken glass, wire 
             etc)
        i    other solid non-combustible wastes
        j    organic wastes, if known (bones, non-native plant material 
             etc)
        k    sewage and domestic liquid wastes
        l    gas cylinders

5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF DUMP
  5.1 Environmental impacts associated with the dump:
        a    birds scavenging
        b    visible contamination of soil
        c    windblown debris
        d    run-off, seepage, oil slicks
        e    smell;
        f    dead vegetation
        g    dead birds or other animals
  5.2 Possible future impacts of the site, eg oil seeping into the ground
  5.3 Are there any sensitive sites nearby, that are vulnerable to 
      impacts?
  5.4 Evidence of measures taken to remediate or rehabilitate the site 
      or prevent dispersal of wastes
  5.5 Has a contaminated site assessment been done on the dump; is 
      the report available?
  5.6 EIAs prepared for dump (clean-up, removal of toxic materials etc)
5.7   Environmental monitoring of the dump (including monitoring 
      of hydrocarbon or heavy metal contamination of soils)

5.8   Recommendations for additional steps that should be taken to 
      manage the impacts of the dump and protect adjacent areas

6     FUTURE PLANS

6.1   Future plans for the site, for cleaning up, analysing 
      environmental effects and minimising environmental effects. Is 
      the site included in a Waste Management Plan?

6.2   Heritage/historic considerations

6.3   Priority of action, that is, urgency of clean-up action
