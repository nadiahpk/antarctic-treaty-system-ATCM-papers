Item 13 (c) Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna

Purposes

To propose that Parties undertaking activities in Antarctica review their operations to ensure non-native species are not introduced and that those which may be present are removed or appropriately destroyed.

To propose that Parties take action to ensure that Tourist and Non-Government activities are conducted to avoid the introduction of non-native species.

Background

Australia's concerns about the introduction and maintenance of non-native species include:

-   Seeds of grasses and other plants which have been introduced and which appear to be capable of reproducing and establishing in the Antarctic environment.
-   Pet birds or other animals and indoor plants which have been maintained on stations.
-   Evidence of mice droppings in a grain store.
-   Insects and plants on ships including tourist vessels.
-   Introduction of micro-organisms on footwear.

Article 4 of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection aims to ensure that non-native species are not introduced into Antarctica. Australia is of the view that the intent of this Article also requires Parties to take action to remove non-native species which are presently in Antarctica.

Proposal

Australia proposes that the Report of this meeting include the following statement:

The Parties noted that Article 4 of Annex II of the Environmental Protocol prohibits introduction of non-native plants and animals into the Antarctic Treaty area except in accordance with a permit. Parties were urged to:

-   Examine all their facilities in Antarctica to identify any non-native species present.
-   Remove any non-native species found not being maintained in accordance with an appropriate permit.
-   Take action as necessary within their authority to ensure that tourist and non-government activities do not result in the introduction of non-native species into Antarctica.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTINUED PRESENCE OF
NON-NATIVE SPECIES OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS

Agenda Item 13 c

(Submitted by Australia)
Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna

Proposed Report Language

Introduction and Continued Presence of Non-native Species of Animals and Plants

The meeting examined Working Paper 29 by Australia which raised concern about the introduction and continued presence of non-native species of animals and plants to Antarctica through human activities. The Parties noted that Article 4 of Annex II of the Environmental Protocol requires that no species of animal or plant not native to the Antarctic area shall be introduced onto land or ice shelves, or into water in the Antarctic Treaty area except in accordance with a permit.

The meeting acknowledged concerns about the introduction and continued presence of non-native species of animals and plants. Some delegations pointed out that new species may become present due to climate change or by natural means and that it is important to be sure before removing a species that they have been introduced by human activity. One delegation raised concerns about the dispersion of species within Antarctica by natural means and by human activity. The meeting agreed that before removing a species from Antarctica it should be reasonably established that the species had been introduced by human activity.

Parties were urged to:

·         Examine all their facilities in Antarctica to identify any non-native species of animals or plants present which have been introduced by human activity.

·         Remove any such non-native species of animals or plants found in or associated with those facilities unless they are present in accordance with an appropriate permit.

·         Take action as necessary within their authority to ensure that tourists and non-government activities do not result in the introduction of non-native species of animals or plants into Antarctic.
