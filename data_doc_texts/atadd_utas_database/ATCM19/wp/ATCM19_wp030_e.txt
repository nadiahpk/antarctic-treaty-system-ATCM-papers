In order to continue the work on a liability-annex to the Protocol, Germany submits the
following proposal to the Consultative Meeting:

1.    The Consultative Meeting takes notice of the work of the legal experts done as re-
      ported by the Chairman of the Group.

2.    The Consultative Meeting extends the mandate of the working group on this subject on
      the basis of the draft elaborated by Prof. Wolfrum.

3.    The Consultative Meeting agrees to convene other meetings of legal experts before the
      XXth Consultative Meeting in the Netherlands..

4.    The Consultative Meeting expresses its hope that as a result of these meetings of legal
      experts, a draft of a liability-annex can be presented to the XXth Consultative Meeting
      for final discussion and adoption.
