HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS
(submitted by New Zealand/Norway/UK)

(Agenda Item 12 b)

The Antarctic Treaty parties have long recognised the importance of historic sites and monuments in Antarctica. The need to take steps to protect these sites was apparent at the first ATCM where parties agreed that "all adequate measures to protect such tombs, buildings or objects of historic interest, from damage and destruction" would be taken (Recommendation I-IX). The ATCM XIV noted:

"... the need to provide for continued and improved protection for those historic monuments that stand as witnesses to a significant human presence in the Antarctic; and which are an essential part of the record of human activity in Antarctica."

2      The Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty reinforced the concern of parties for the preservation of historic sites and monuments. Annex V (Article 8) states that listed historic sites and monuments "shall not be damaged, removed or destroyed". It also provides for sites and monuments of recognised historic value to be designated as a Protected Area. Sites and monuments located either within or outside these areas can also be listed as a Historic Site or Monument.

3      The Ross Sea region is notable for the number of huts located there which are associated with the "Heroic Age" of Antarctic exploration (1895-1916). In particular the huts established by Captain R F Scott at Hut Point in 1901, Cape Evans in 1911, and by Ernest Shackleton at Cape Royds in 1907; the huts and remnants of these and earlier Antarctic expeditions still exist.

4      In recognition of parties' responsibility to ensure the maximum protection for the historic sites and monuments in Antarctica, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States propose that a further seven monuments be listed. These monuments have been identified by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust which, with its United Kingdom associate, was established to conserve and protect the historic sites and monuments in the Ross Sea region.

5      The monuments are largely all associated with the "Heroic Age" of Antarctic exploration. Four relate to the British Antarctic Expeditions of 1901-1904 and 1910-1913. Two relate to the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1912 and the whaling activity of last century.
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
(New Zealand/United Kingdom)

NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

The Representatives,
Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8.

Recommend to their Governments to add the following historic monuments to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9, thereby guaranteeing its full protection and respect as envisaged by the Recommendations noted above.

a)	Rock Shelter "Granite House". Cape Geology. Granite Harbour. This shelter was constructed in December 1911 for use as a field kitchen on Taylor's second geological excursion during the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1913. It was enclosed on three sides with granite boulder walls and used a sledge to form a roof-tree which supported seal skins anchored by heavy rocks (latitude 77o 00'E, longitude 162o 32'E). A 1981 inspection of the "house" found it in good condition although the sledge had begun to disintegrate. The most recent visit to the site in 1990 reported that this deterioration was accelerating.

b)	Depot. Hells Gate Moraine. Inexpressible Island. Terra Nova Bay. An emergency depot, consisting of a sledge loaded with supplies and equipment, was placed on 25 January 1913 by the British Antarctic Expedition at the close of the 1910-1913 Expedition. The depot was established by the crew of the Terra Nova to provide security in the event the ship was unable to return and pick them up (latitude 74o 56'S, longitude 163o 48'E). In 1994 the sledge and supplies were removed in order to stabilise their condition as wind and scoria particles had started to cause rapid deterioration.

c)	Message Post. Cape Crozier. Erected on 22 January 1902 by Captain R F Scott's Discovery Expedition (the National Antarctic Expedition of 1901-04) and consists of a post to which a metal cyclinder was attached containing an account of the Expedition's movements. It was intended to provide information for the expedition relief ships (latitude 77o 27'S, longitude 169o 16'E). The message post, although weathered, still stands, its grain blasted into high relief by countless storms. The record cyclinder no longer exists.

d)	Message Post. Cape Wadworth. Coulman Island. A metal cyclinder nailed to a red pole 8 metres above sea level placed by Captain R F Scott on 15 January 1902. He also painted the rocks behind the post red and white to make it more conspicuous (latitude 73o 19'S, longitude 169o 47'E)..

NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8.

Recommend to their Governments to add the following historic monuments to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9, thereby guaranteeing its full protection and respect as envisaged by the Recommendations noted above.

a)    Message Post, Svend Foyn Island. A pole with a box attached was placed on 16 January 1895 during the whaling cruise of Henryk Bull and Captain Leonard Kristensen of the ship "Antarctica". It was examined and found intact by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1898-1900 and then sighted from the beach by the USS Edisto in 1956 and USCGC Glacier in 1965 (latitude approximately 71 degrees 52'S, longitude 171 degrees 10'E).

b)    Prestrud's Cairn, at foot of main bluff Scott Nunataks, Queen Alexandra Mountains. A small rock cairn at the foot of the main bluff on the north side of the nunataks by Lieutenant K Prestrud on 3 December 1911 during the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1912 (latitude 77o 12'S, longitude 154o 30'W).

Historic Sites and Monuments
(submitted by New Zealand/Norway/UK)

The Antarctic Parties have long recognised the importance of historic sites and monuments 
in Antarctica. The need to take steps to protect these sites was apparent at the first ATCM 
where parties agreed that "all adequate measures to protect such tombs, buildings or 
objects of historic interest, from damage and destruction" would be taken (Recommendation 
I-IX). The ATCM noted:

"... the need to provide for continued and improved protection for those historic monuments 
that stand as witnesses to a significant human presence in the Antarctic; and which are an 
essential part of the record of human activity in Antarctica".

2    The Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty reinforced the concern of parties 
for the preservation of historic sites and monuments. Annex V (Article 8) states that listed 
historic sites and monuments "shall not be damaged, removed or destroyed". It also 
provides for sites and monuments of recognised historic value to be designated as a 
Protected Area. Sites and monuments located either within or outside these areas can also 
be listed as a Historic Site or Monument.

3    The Ross Sea region is notable for the number of huts located there which are 
associated with the "Heroic Age" of Antarctic exploration (1895-1916). In particular the huts 
established by Captain R F Scott at Hut Point in 1901, Cape Evans in 1911, and by Ernest 
Shackleton at Cape Royds in 1907; the huts and remnants of these and earlier Antarctic 
expeditions still exist.

4    In recognition of parties' responsibility to ensure the maximum protection for the 
historic sites and monuments in Antarctica, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom 
propose that a further six monuments be listed. These monuments have been identified by 
the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust which, with its United Kingdom associate, was 
established to conserve and protect the historic sites and monuments in the Ross Sea 
region.

5    The monuments are largely all associated with the "Heroic Age" of Antarctic 
exploration. Four relate to the British Antarctic Expeditions of 1901-1904 and 1910-1913. 
Two relate to the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1912 and the to the whaling activity 
of last century.
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

(New Zealand/Norway)

NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8.

Recommend to their Governments to add the following historic monuments to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9, thereby guaranteeing its full protection and respect as envisaged by the Recommendations noted above.

a) Message Post, Svend Foyn Island. A pole with a box attached was placed on 16 January 1895 during the whaling expedition of Henryk Bull and Captain Leonard Kristensen of the ship "Antarctica". It was examined and found intact by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1898-1900 and then sighted from the beach by the USS Edisto in 1956 and USCGC Glacier in 1965 (latitude approximately 71 o 52'S, longitude 171 o 10'E).

b) Prestrud's Cairn, at the foot of main bluff Scott Nunataks, Queen Alexandra Mountains. A small rock cairn at the foot of the main bluff on the north side of the nunataks by Lieutenant K Prestrud on 3 December 1911 during the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1912 (latitude 77 o 12'S, longitude 154 o 30'W).

NEW HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16, and XIV-8

Recommend to their Governments to add the following historic monuments to the "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the proposing Government or Governments" annexed to Recommendation VII-9, thereby guaranteeing its full protection and respect as envisaged by the Recommendations noted above.

a)      Rock Shelter "Granite House", Cape Geology, Granite Harbour. This shelter was constructed in December 1911 for use as a field kitchen by Taylor's second geological excursion during the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1913. it was enclosed on three sides with granite boulder walls and used as a sledge to form a roof tree which supported seal skins anchored by heavy rocks (latitude 77o 00'E, longitude 162o 32'E). A 1981 inspection of the "house" found it in good condition although the sledge had begun to disintegrate. The most recent visit to the site in 1990 reported that this deterioration was accelerating.

b)      Depot, Hells Gate Moraine, Inexpressible Island, Terra Nova Bay. An emergencydepot, consisting of a sledge loaded with supplies and equipment, was placed on 25 January 1913 by the British Antarctic Expedition at the close of the 1910-1913 expedition. The depot was established by the crew of the Terra Nova to provide security in the event the ship was unable to return and pick them up (latitude 74o 56'S), longitude 163o 48'E). In 1994 the sledge and supplies were removed in order to stabilise their condition as wind and scoria particles had started to cause rapid deterioration.

c)      Message Post, Cape Crozier. Erected on 22 January 1902 by Captain Robert F Scott's discovery Expedition (the National Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904) and consists of a post to which a metal cyclinder was attached containing an account of the Expedition's movements. It was intended to provide information for the expedition relief ships (latitude 77o 27'S, longitude 169o 16'E). The message post, although weathered, still stands, its grain blasted into high relief by countless storms. The record cyclinder no longer exists.

d)      Message Post, Cape Wadworth, Coulman Island. A metal cyclinder nailed to a red pole 8 metres above sea level placed by Captain R F Scott on 15 January 1902. He also painted the rocks behind the post red and white to make it more conspicuous (latitude 73o 19'S, longitude 169o 47'E).
