ANTARCTIC CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR OIL SPILLS IN THE SEA

I.  Introduction

The accidents which have occurred recently in Antarctic waters and the steady increase in traffic which is observed from year to year, not only in logistical vessels but also in scientific and tourist ships, forces us to think about and suggest the drafting of common Contingency Plans for areas with concentrations of bases and stations which will make it possible, in an emergency, for the operating countries in the area to deal with an accident appropriately and in a coordinated manner.

In the case of the South Shetland Islands area, where there is heavy sea traffic in summer due to the concentration of bases and stations belonging to the different countries established there, it would be useful to draft a multinational Contingency Plan capable of fighting contamination from oil spills in the sea.

Within the framework of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the operating countries have committed their efforts to applying the different recommendations contained in it. This in turn makes us think of the need for the countries to begin to structure a plan of this kind in a coordinated fashion.

The Chilean Navy currently has an Antarctic Oil Spills Contingency Plan which has been implemented since 18 January 1994 and is part of the National Plan.

II.  Organisation

As this is subsidiary to the National Plan, it is part of the organisation of the Punta Arenas Regional Contamination Control Coordination Centre, on which Puerto Williams, the Capitán Arturo Prat Naval Base, the Puerto Bahía Fildes Captaincy and the Antarctic Naval Patrol (consisting of two open sea tugs) depend, which gives it the capacity to act in the whole maritime space of Chilean Antarctic Territory, in particular the South Shetlands area, where most maritime activity takes place in summer, which is from 1 December to 1 March.

To carry out its task, the organisation will be equipped with the following resources from next summer:

                                                 80 rolls of paper

III.  Final considerations

Chile has taken important steps towards an Antarctic Contingency Plan and is once more 
in a position to provide the necessary support to set up a Multinational Contingency Plan for oil 
spills in the sea on the existing organisation. It can also offer the Punta Arenas control centre 
to take on the coordination and communications tasks related to the multinational plan and 
training in the operation of the material designed to combat marine contamination.
