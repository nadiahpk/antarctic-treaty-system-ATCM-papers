APPLICABILITY OF DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE ARCTIC TO THE ANTARCTIC

The Representatives,

Bearing in mind the importance of insuring appropriate coordination between the global 
agreements on the environment and the operation of the Antarctic Treaty System, and in 
particular the Protocol on Protection of the Environment to the Antarctic Treaty, as agreed at 
the 18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting;

Considering that among these global agreements there is a notable affinity between the 
Protocol on Protection of the Environment to the Antarctic Treaty and the Declaration on 
Protection of the Arctic Environment or the Rovaniemi Declaration, both documents from 1991;

Considering the potential usefulness to both systems of a better knowledge of the 
development of their environmental policies;

Resolve:

To ask the President of the 19th ATCM to contact the President of the Ministerial 
Meeting on the Arctic Environment so that both the ATCM, and later the Protocol on Protection 
of the Environment, as well as the Ministerial Meeting on the Environment and the International 
Arctic Science Committee (IASC), appoint experts to attend the meetings and make their 
contribution to the debate about certain specific items on the agenda.
