Chairman Nagata (Japan) called the meeting to order at 10:10 hours
and introduced Mr. Nadao, Minister of Education and concurrently General
Director of the Headquarters of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedi-
tion.

Mr. Nadao delivered a welcoming address on behalf of his government,
in which he stressed the basic importance of logistics in Antarctic
research expeditions.

Chairman Nagata (Japan) read two goodwill message telegrams to the
Meeting: one from Mr. Hamm of the Mawson Station and the other from Mr.
Murayama of the Syowa Station.

He then called a brief recess at 10:16. The session was resumed at
10:40.

Chairman Nagata (Japan) introducted a draft Rules of Procedure(of which
the text had been distributed to all delegations), and, in accordance with
suggestions his government had received from signatory countries, he proposed
an amendment to Rule 2, deleting the phrase which read: " . . . prior to the
opening of the meeting." Having ascertained that there were no objections,
he declared the Rules of Procedure approved, as amended.

On the motion of the Delegations from the United Kingdom and the United
States, Chairman Nagata nominated, and the Meeting appointed, Mr. J. Lavett
of the Australian Delegation and Baron de Gerlache de Gomery of the Belgian
Delegation respectively as Rapporteurs, the latter on the understanding that
his charge would be taken over by the French Delegation as soon as it arrived
in Tokyo.

In accordance with Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure, Chairman Nagata
(Japan) advised the meeting of the appointment of Mr. Shibuya as Secretary
General, Dr. Kusunoki and Mr. Misumi as Secretaries.

On the proposal of the Australian Delegation, the Representative of the
Japanese Government was nominated, and approved by the Meeting as chairman for
the opening and closing sessions.

Chairman Nagata (Japan), referring to the proposed agenda which had been
previously circulated among all participating governments, reported that
the agenda had been accepted by all of them, and noting no objections, he
declared the Agenda adopted.

Dr. Roberts (U.K.) proposed, under Recommendation IV-24, that Rear
Adm. R.N. Panzarini of Argentina should be asked to attend the Meeting as a
guest expert.

The proposal was supported by Argentine Delegation and approved by all
countries except Belgium whose Government thinks that this proposal does not
conform with to the interpretation which should be given to Recommendation
IV-24. The Belgian Delegation abstained, pending instructions from his Govern-
ment, but he hoped that it would allow him to give a favourable conclusion to
the British proposal.

Having finished the procedural matters, Chairman Nagata declared the
Opening Session closed at 10:55 hours.

Chairman Aureggi (Argentina) expressed his government's keen interest
in the exchange of technical information concerning Antarctic logistics, and
invited the Australian Delegation to present its paper.

Mr. Styles (Australia) presented a short summary of the 1st paper of
his Delegation on the outline design of an Antarctic station to minimize
drift accumulation (Document 7). By way of an explanation of the background
to his summary, he described the station at Wilkes as being based on rock
in an area where there was fairly high drift accumulation and stated that the
temperatures varied from -37°C in winter to +8°C in summer with a mean of
approximately -10°C, an environment that could not be called very severe in
Antarctic terms. The logical thing, he observed, seemed to be to try to use
the forces which create the problem to remove the problem, and, on the basis
of wind tunnel tests with a scale model and the actual experiences his team had
had, he suggested that (1) buildings should be built on ridges, instead of
in a depression, with a minimum ground clearance of 5 ft. beneath the build-
ings in order to ensure that the wind would keep the slots open beneath them;
(2) the buildings should form a single line having the direction across the
wind; (3) the station should be designed storongly enough to withstand winds
of 120 knots.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) asked whether the laboratory test, to which
Mr. Styles had referred, had been conducted on a simulated rock surface

- 25 -

or on ice, and commented that the acceleration of the wind under the elevated
building might erode that surface and form a hollow and thus distort the
calculations.

Mr. Styles (Australia) replied that the test had been conducted with
a hard surface and that he expected the hollow to be filled with a low
velocity wind. On these grounds, he thought that it would not cause any
closure of the open area beneath the building.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) cited one of his experiences with elevated
stores, four feet above the surface, to show an increase of the drift on
the downwind side, and Mr. Styles replied that in the recent experiment
conducted on the plateau near Wilkes where deposition exceeded erosion, the
area beneath the building showed no sign of closing, although the test could
not be regarded as definitive.

Dr. Kinosita (Japan) invited attention to the fact that Reynold's
law of similitude, on which the design of ordinary wind-tunnel experiments
is based, is hardly applicable to wind-tunnel experiments on snow drift
(such as has been carried out by Mr. Styles). Anyone planning such ex-
periments should refer to E. Inoue: Oyo Rikigaku (Applied Mechanics)
7 - 7 (1948) 15,4 - 22 (1951) 27.

Baron Gaston de Gerlache de Comery (Belgium) wondered whether it was
possible to construct an entire elevated station on ice shelves, and
Mr. Styles observed that an elevated structure might have some advantages
if footings were provided for the buildings with a jacking system which
would maintain a constant elevation above the surface.

Mr. Sato (Japan) gave a report on the recent building at the Syowa
Station (Document 18) with the visual aid of slides, emphasizing the material
used and engineering techniques applied to the construction of each building
of the Station.

Chairman Aureggi (Argentina) called a recess at 12:00 hours.

Chairman Areggi (Argentina) opened the session at 14:00 hours.

Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) outlined his Delegation's paper concerned with
man-made interference and site contamination (Document 20). He dealt with
the problems of rubbish disposal and radio noise, and the necessity to
signpost sites and restrict transportation on them.

Mr. Smith (United States) summarized his country's paper on construction
concepts for camps on permanent ice caps (Document 23),citing the examples
of various stations built at the snow surface or in tunnels. Referring to
the impending replacement of the South Pole station, he stated that an
elevated station was out of the question due to the expense involved.

Cant. Bernstein (United States) described the paper entitled "Fuel
systems employed at the Antarctic Stations of the United States." (Documnet 24), covering three systems; welded tanks, fuel bladders, and collap-
sible fuel drums.

Lt. Cdr. Búsico (Argentina) then read extracts from Documents 3,4,5
and 6, dealing respectively with the construction at Almirante Brown Station,
the new dwelling house constructed at Destacament Naval (Naval Station)
Orcadas, over a reinforced concrete box, the dismountable Antarctic refuge
transportable by air, and the plant installation with air-cooled engines, and
use of the heat.

Mr. Styles (Australia) summarized Documents 9, 12 and 47 of his Delega-
tion, concerned with the accommodation for a temporary station on the Amery
Ice Shelf, concreting problems and the modern requirements of Antarctic
surgery.

Mr. Brown (Australia) presented Document 8, "Structural design of
an elevated station", and then proceeded to cover Document 10 "Project
planning, programming and site construction of an Antarctic station." He said
that the station was scheduled to be completed four years from the time of
approval. He gave an account of the progress of the work, and mentioned
the problems encountered in using explosives, stating that a solution was
found by using AN 60 gelignite. He then went on to present Document 11,
"Integration of power, heating and water supplies applied at Australian
Antarctic stations." In this, he dealt with the importance and the various
methods of recovering waste heat and the advantages of a central heating
system, and described the water cooled engine and central heating system
used in the station.

In answer to a question by Baron de Gerlached de Gomery (Belgium),
Mr. Brown (Australia) specified the buildings heated by this system.

Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) asked whether any way had been found of
overcoming condensation, fouling, corrosion and excess back pressure, and,
in reply, Mr. Brown (Australia)suggested an exhaust heat exchanger or
silencer, and pointed out that the heat requirement in the station system
had not yet necessitated these.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) mentioned the humidity problems caused by the
drying effect of electric heating, and Mr. Brown (Australia) replied that
Australian expeditions had had no humidity problems, due to the presence
of water, in ablation areas within the sleeping block, and in cooking areas.
Humidifiers have only been necessary in the operating theatres for security
against electro-static explosions.

Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) remarked on the highly successful waste energy
system at Plateau Station giving the relevant figures on fuel savings
resulting from the system, and offered to make the engineering and support-
ing documents available when the Delegation returned to the United States.

Chairman Styles invited the Australian Alternate Representative to
present his paper "Tests on building panels for structural strength and
fire resistance." (Document 13).                           Dr. Nagata (Japan) asked the United States Delegation for information on

Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) concurred that the arch may not be necessary on 
floating ice shelves where the temperature is warmer, and mentioned other 
factors considered in favouring an arch for the South Pole Station, such 
as the low temperature.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium), speaking on the subsidence of 
buildings indicated the advantages and disadvantages of using solid materi-
als.

Chairman Styles (Australia) reminded the Meeting that this was an interim 
summary and hoped for the contribution of the French and Soviet Delegations 
on this item. He then asked the Secretary to arrange the presentation of 
the two films: 1) Project Ice Shelf; 2) Vostok 900.

                 New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the United 
                 Kingdom and the United States of America.

Officers'        Chairmen:     (i) Mr. L. Parada (Chile)
                               (ii) Mr. R.B. Thomson (New Zealand)

                               (Belgium)

Chairman Parada (Chile) called the meeting to order at 09:05 hours.

Secretary Kusunoki (Japan) introduced Commander James Keith of the 
U.S. Naval Support Force, Antractica, who was an addition to the United 
States Delegation in the capacity of an adviser.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium), referring to the proposal of 
the United Kingdom Delegation that Rear Admiral Panzarini of Argentina be
invited to this Meeting as an observer, reported that he had been authorized 
to accept said proposal since it is agreeable to the Argentine Delegation, 
but as an exception and on the understanding that this would not be a further 
interpretation of Recommendation IV-24.

Chairman Parada (Chile), having ascertained that the delegations had 
no further reports or comments to make on Agenda 1, declared Agenda 1 
finished, and suggested that the Meeting move on to Agenda 2.

* * * * * * * * *

AGENDA 2: Oversnow transport; new vehicles, including 
air-cushion types.

Mr. Brown (Australia), referring to his paper "Experience with Nodwell 
RN110B tracked carrier "(Document 25), described some of this experiences 
with the Nodwell RN110B at Wilkes Station, which enatled his team to overcome 
most of the difficulties it encountered with the earlier model, such as cold 
failure, and the uneven lengthening of the rubber tracks. He concluded 
by saying that with the exception of the limited low temperature capability, 
the carrier was a very useful vehicle for traverse work.

In the absence of comments or question, Chairman Parada (Chile) invited 
the Australian Delegation to deliver another paper.

Mr. Brown (Australia) described "A small caravan for Antarctic traver-
ses "(Document 26) a moulded, monolithic, glass fibre plastic and foam 
sapdwith shell, mounted on sledge runners with leaf springs, designed to 
accommodate 3 men, with a maximum payload of 1.5 tons.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) commented that for long distance journeys, it 
could well be necessary to suffer the inconvenience of using tents since a 
caravan weighing 1½ tons represents about 250 days of food and fuel for 
four men. Tents for four men would weigh only about 110 lbs (50 kilos).

Dr. Nishibori (Japan), representative of the Antarctic Snow Vehicle 
Design Engineering Committee of Japan, explained the problems related to the 
development of snow vehicles and their design. (Document 28). He also 
mentioned the successful completion of KD 604, 605 and 606. He then 
reported on the 2,500-KM, three-month traverse from Syowa Station to Plateau 
Station undertaken by the Japanese Observation Party in 1967-68 headed by 
Dr. Torii.

Dr. Torii (Japan) explained, with colour slides, the various vehicles 
used at Syowa Station.

Mr. Styles (Australia) asked how long it had taken the Japanese Party 
to go from the coast to Plateau Station and what type of heater the party 
had used on the trip. Dr. Torii (Japan) replied that it had taken his party 
40 days, from November 5 to December 14, 1967, and on the second ques-
tion, he referred Mr. Styles to Fig. C of Document 28. In response to 
Sir Vivian Fuch's (U.K.) question, Dr. Nishibori (Japan) explained that the 
Japanese vehicles were constructed with special high tensile steel track 
pads with rubber cleats to prevent the tracks from slipping.

*     *     Recess at 10:20 hours     *     *

The session was resumed at 10:40 hours under the chairmanship of 
Mr. R.B. Thomson (New Zealand).

Dr. Nagata (Japan) requested those delegates with specific questions 
with regard to the Japanese snow vehicles to submit their questions to 
Dr. Nishibori, so that Mr. Yamashita could prepare adequate answers to them.

Secretary Kusunoki (Japan) announced the arrival of Rear Adm. Panzarini 
(Argentina).

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) presented a paper on "The use of hovercraft 
in polar regions" (Document 33). He described the various tests made with 
hovercraft SR.N5 and its extended version, SR. N6, carried out in Canada and Sweden, 
and discussed their advantages and disadvantages as seen from the viewpoint of 
their use in the Antarctic. He reported that much information had been 
obtained during these trials and that the problems associated with ancillary 
equipment could be solved easily. He stated that their present range (145 
nautical miles) was too limited for long-range polar work. For this reason 
and because of the difficulty of traversing steep slopes and sastrugi fields, 
they should at present be regarded as practical only for ship-to-shore work. 
He illustrated his paper by presenting a film.

Mr. Styles (Australia) wanted to know (1) if Sir Vivian Fuchs had any 
curves showing payload versus range, taking into account the fuel con-
sumption for the SR. N6, (2) if he had come across the problem arising from 
the difficulty of maneuverability and the question of how to detect a crevasse

- 33 -

ahead of the vehicle in time to stop it, and (3) whether he had considered 
the possibility of handling such a relatively large vehicle on small ships 
like those employed by some nations in Antarctic explorations.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.), referring to question (1), invited Mr. Styles 
to look, afterwards, at some technical details he had. With 
regard to question (2), he observed that it depended on the skill and expe-
rience of the operator, and in reply to question (3), he stated that the 
dimensions and weight could be reduced by removing the skirt and the lateral 
chamber sections, enabling it to be carried aboard ship.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) asked what advantages a hovercraft would 
afford over a helicopter as a vehicle in antarctic explorations.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) observed that a hovercraft would be definitely 
superior to a helicopter in conditions of bad visibility.

In reply to a question of Dr. Kinosita (Japan), Sir Vivian Fuchs 
mentioned that the maximum slope that a hovercraft was expected to climb 
was 1 in 6. There followed a discussion on the technical aspects of hover-
craft.

Capt. Bernstein (U.S.A.) presented a summary of Document 34, entitled, 
"Vehicle road systems on snow and ice", prepared by members of the U.S. Civil 
Engineering Laboratory at Port Hueneme, California, which described the 
equipment and techniques used to build high quality snow roads for wheeled 
vehicles up to 75,000 lbs. Thirteen slides were shown illustrating the snow 
roads, construction procedures, and the snow processing equipment.

The session adjourned at 12:05 hours.

Dr. Roberts (U.K.) took the chair and opened the session at 14:10 hours.
Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) proceeded to summarise his papers under
Agenda 2. The first--"Human and mechanical failures in temperatures below
minus 60°F" (Document 29)--described the problems of fuel and lubricants,
metal fatigue, weld failure, the hardening of rubber tracks, the cracking
of cables, the failure of stoves, batteries and electrical equipment, and
glass contruction. To Capt. Bernstein's (U.S.A.) question regarding whether
the welds had been x-rayed, magna-fluxed or oil dye penetrated, previously,
he replied in the negative.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) advised silicone rubber insulation for electric
cables to avoid cracking, and mentioned the system of passing A.C. power
through the battery to heat it. He warned that silicone rubber is destroyed
if it comes into contact with hydrocarbons.

Mr. Brown (Australia) reported his country's use of the cold room for
checking rubbers and plastics. Answering Mr. Styles' enquiry concerning
American cold-room experimentation, Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) said that most recent
work in this field had been concerned with aircraft problems, a field where
much remained to be done. He said that much use was made of empirical field
observations in oversnow vehicle design. Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) agreed
with this.

Chairman Roberts (U.K.) then welcomed Admiral Panzarini from Argentina,
in the capacity of Observer.

Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) proceeded with his next paper, entitled
"Effective methods of navigation under varying conditions on the Antarctic
Plateau." (Document 30),listing the equipment used, and stressing the effectiveness

- 35 -

of the mirror system, a point which Mr. Brown (Australia) endorsed. Mr.
Thomson then presented the next paper, concerned with the field use of motor
toboggans (Document 31), covering the strengthening modifications made to
the Polaris 95 model, stressing that the speed should not exceed 5 or 6 miles
per hour. He then described the advantages of the Polaris model 2500. He
concluded by describing the convenience of using toboggans for short distances
of about 4 miles, as opposed to dog teams.

On the invitation of the Chairman, Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) recounted
his disappointing experiences with motor toboggans, adding that strengthened
Skidoos were being used, and he expressed the need for a small reliable
motor toboggan.

Mr. Brown (Australia) spoke of his country's experiences over the past
few years with the Polaris K95, Q16, and K75, the Skidoo, and more recently,
the Snow Cruiser, and asked about the Yamaha; Baron de Gerlache de Gomery
(Belgium) said that he had no trouble with Polaris Toboggans.

Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) reported his country's use of motor toboggans for
short sorties away from the laboratories or at stations such as McMurdo, for
oversnow or geological traverses and for local transport for remote field
parties. The Eliason was first introduced in 1961 for glaciological
research on the Ross Ice Shelf. The Polaris K95 has been used extensively
but is now not manufactured. Recently motor toboggans made by Fox Co. of
Wisconsin have been purchased. They are largely untried to date but have
been satisfactory so far, in 700 miles of operation on Anvers Island.

Chairman Roberts (U.K.) hoped that further information on the Fox
motor toboggan could be included in the record, and then asked whether
anyone present had had practical experience with the recently developed
Swedish types. Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) said that one of the Swedish
machines was being evaluated by them.

Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) presented the paper on Land-rovers used
at Scott Base (Document 32), describing modifications, and noting the
effectiveness of using treadless sand tyres, concluded that the vehicle
was versatile and required little maintenance.

- 36 -

Mr Brown (Australia) asked for information as to whether any progress 
had been made in developing wheels to travel on snow successfully.

Mr. Thomson (New Zealand) said that, in his experience, the land-rover 
was preferable to modified Volkswagen, especially on soft snow.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) called attention to the relatively small amount 
of maintenance required for wheeled vehicles as contrasted with track 
vehicles and indicated therefore that continued experimentation with wheeled 
vehicles was to be encouraged. He recounted a project with a Dodge Power 
Wagon operated between Byrd Station and the Byrd VLF Station, 11 miles apart. This 
project had limited success. A second project being undertaken by Fabco Co. is a wheeled 
oversnow vehicle using 2 articulating axles with 8 large tyres each. He listed 
the important factors in the development of a wheeled vehicle as 1) power; 2) 
footprint pressure; 3) clearance; 4) wheel diameter.

Mr. Styles (Australia) reported that his country's experiences with 
various wheeled vehicles had indicated that in their present stage of deve-
lopment they could be used only on a very limited path between crevasses 
and melt water streams in the ablation zone near Mawson. Even a few 
inches of fresh drift would stop a wheeled vehicle.

Chairman Roberts (U.K.) commented that the development of low pressure 
balloon-type tyres was required and asked the U.S.A. about snow trains con-
ceived in U.S.A. and Canada for Arctic work.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A) affirmed that an overland tractor train 
had been successfully tested but abandoned as a project by the U.S. Army.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) suggested trying a Swamp Buggy, developed for 
oil prospecting in swamp.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) then described a successfully-
employed AS 24, made in Belgium, characterised by small balloon tyre wheels.

In answer to the chairman's inquiry, concerning the maximum practical 
size of wheeled vehicles as regards crevasse hazard, Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) said 
that the tyre width as well as the diameter was important in that when 
crevasses were approached at an acute angle, narrow-width tyres would sink 
into the snow bridges. A compromise must be reached in the design, Mr. Smith said,

for large diameter wheels tended to move the cargo bed or cab of the vehicle to 
greater distance above the snow surface thereby making access to the vehicle 
difficult.

Mr. Styles (Australia) stressed the necessity of a balance between 
lowground pressure and traction, saying that the lack of traction would be a 
disadvantage of the Swamp Buggy in soft snow. He suggested as a solution 
that provision should be made to vary tyre pressures with varying snow 
conditions encountered.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) asked about the time limit for obtaining 
information for the record, and Chairman Roberts (U.K.) said this would be 
reported by the Secretariat later.

*     *     Recess at 15:35 hours     *     *

Session resumed at 16:00 hours under the chairmanship of Mr. Smith 
(U.S.A.). Chairman Smith welcomed the Soviet Delegation, and reported that 
they would present papers scheduled in Agenda 1 the following day. The Soviet 
Delegation promised to distribute its papers at that time.

Agenda 3: "Air transport including airfields"

Lt. Cdr. Búsico (Argentina) summarised Document 35 "Special preparation 
of the C-47 airplane for Antarctic flights," and Document 36, "Portable 
equipment for fuel load to airplanes."

Dr. Sanuki (Japan) asked about the flying hours of the C-47 and the 
position of the Marbore gas turbine on it.

Lt. Cdr. Búsico (Argentina) replied that the plane had flown 1500 hours 
since conversion. The turbine had been installed in the after end of the 
fuselage.

Mr. Styles (Australia) presented a paper on the marking of airstrips 
in Antarctica (Document 37), saying that the use of markers should approach 
the ICAO's standards as closely as possible, and described the provisions, 
which he outlined, as conforming to these.

- 38 -
Capt. Bernstein (U.S.A.), referring to the cone markers recommended 
in the paper, feared that they might become covered with ice and snow 
if left unattended and that they possibly lacked the reflecting capability 
of a barrel for an aircraft's radar approach to the runway.

Mr. Styles (Australia) replied that the airstrips in mind would not be 
unattended.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) noted the convenience of using 
uniform markers, and, while agreeing with him, Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) 
objected that owing to the impermanent nature of many of the airfields the 
availablity of barrel markers made them satisfactory.

Chairman Smith (U.S.A.) concluded that complete standardisation was 
still distant because of the wide variety of aircraft operations.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) referred to Document 39, "Aviation 
support for the U.S. Antarctic Research Program," and invited questions 
concerning air operations.

Mr. Styles (Australia) aked about the method of compacting snow for 
heavy aircraft landing.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) replied that they used a ski-equipped 
Hercules and thus did not compact snow, but only levelled it.

Mr. Styles (Australia) then described the problems encountered with 
landing aircraft on the plateau near Wilkes where there was a lenticular 
formation which tended to fail on impact.

Dr. Korotkevích (Soviet Union)asked about the past and future use of 
Starlifter. Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) detailed the past success and the 
future planned flights of this airplane. In 1966-67, C-141 Starlifter landed on the 
Annual Ice Runway establishing the feasibility of using the aircraft to carry 
passengers and cargo. C-141 Starlifters will be utilized in the 1968-69 
austral summer season to carry both cargo and passengers. It is expected that 
five or six flights would be scheduled.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) then described a rescue mission flown by the 
United States from McMurdo Station to Halley Bay Station where a temporary 
emergency air strip had to be made at very short notice. He expressed his grati-
tude for the skill with which this operation had been conducted.

-39 -

Chairman Smith (U.S.A.) closed the discussion of Agenda 3.

Secretary Kusunoki (Japan) asked that additional information on motor 
toboggans and other subjects as called for in the record to be sent to the 
Ministry of Education before the end of the month.

Chairman Joubert (South Africa) called the meeting to order at 
09:00 hours.

On the invitation of the Chairman, Dr. Torii (Japan) reported on the 
use of a portable gyroscopic compass which had satisfactorily helped his 
team determine its position during an Antarctic traverse. In response to 
Mr. Styles' question as to how effective the gyroscopic compass had been in 
rough conditions, he reported that it had proved quite useful.

Lt. Cdr. Búsico (Argentina) summarized the paper of his Delegation entitled "Employment of small plastic craft in ice areas" (Document 40), 
describing the various advantages of the plastic surface boat (superior resistance, lightness, high maneuverability, ease of cleaning and repair 
and small maintenance requirement) used at the station on Laurie Island and its disadvantages (the tendency of its screw to be damaged by submerged ice, 
and the slipperiness of the interior surface when wet).

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) observed that plastic boats, especially when operating with divers, were liable to be unstable, and in reply, Lt. Cdr. 
Búsico (Argentina) reported that the experiences on the boat proved that the boat was suitable and that divers had preferred to work with plastic 
boats.

Mr. Styles (Australia) presented a paper entitled "Mooring bollards for ships in 100 knot winds" (Document 41), which described the design 
and techniques employed to hold 2000-ton vessels at winds of 100 knots at the Australian Antarctic stations.

In the absence of any question or comment, Chairman Joubert (South Africa) asked the Australian Delegation to present its next paper.

Mr. Styles (Australia) presented his next paper, entitled "Icebreaker operations in Antarctic waters, " (Document 42) which discussed the limitat-
ions of operating icebreakers as escorts to other ships. He suggested, as a project for a future design study, the possibility of combining the 
functions of an icebreaker and an expedition ship in a single vessel and discussed two examples, "Ob" of the U.S.S.R. and "Fuji" of Japan.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) observed that the shape of hull designed to carry 3,000 tons or more of cargo, did not lend itself to the traditional 
forms of an icebreaker. He concluded that the length of a ship, meant to have reasonable maneuverability, should not exceed 300 feet unless it became 
an icebreaker proper. He asked about the relative enphasis given to ice-
breaker and cargo carrier features in the specific case of "Fuji".

Mr. Styles (Australia) commented that the absolute size presented 
- - 131 

Dr. Nagata (Japan) commented, in reply to Sir Vivian Fuchs' question that "Fuji" is an icebreaker rather than a cargo carrier.

Adm. Honda (Japan) presented his paper on sea and air transportation to the Syowa Station (Document 43). He described the air transport methods 
employed by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition -- inside the helicopter and sling transportation. The latter method proved by far the most efficient 
method in terms of time saved. He then reported on the performance records, and concluded by saying that the sling system was very effective for the 
movement of small amounts of cargo between ship and shore.

Mr. Styles (Australia) commented that air transport of bulk fuel to the shore was not very satisfactory unless there was a possibility of 
using a large helicopter or a hovercraft. He then asked Adm. Honda whether the Japanese air transport operations had been handicapped by the cloud 
conditions and how the helicopter had unloaded cargoes of awkward shape such as building materials, particularly when there was wind.

Adm. Honda (Japan) answered that toward the end of January -- when the "Fuji" arrived at Syowa -- the Japanese team had been favoured with good 
weather conditions, which had enabled it to operate for most of the month. The visibility had to be 5 miles or greater for most operations. On the 
question of the transport of bulky cargo, he referred Mr. Styles to page 6 of his report (Document 43) in which the limitations are indicated.

Dr. Nagata (Japan) reported that the maximum size of cargo transported by sling was 6 by 2 metres, weighing up to 2 tons.

Rear Adm. Panzarini (Observer) classified polar vessels in terms of their functions into those performing (1) supply operations, (2) scientific 
work in general at sea and (3) hydrographic surveying. Polar ships operated in two different types of areas: (a) those with heavy sea ice conditions 
and (b) those with favourable ice conditions or open waters. He observed that, in the long run, different designs of ships for different tasks and 
for different physical conditions would give the best results, expensive though they might be.

Dr. Korotkevich (Soviet Union)presented his paper, entitled "New research expedition ships for the Soviet Antarctic Expedition".(Document 44).

Hercules, for transporting men and supplies usually 450 to 500 miles
from Scott Base.

    Mr. Victor (France) reported that his team used Allouette 2's, capable
of flying 1,000 km at an altitude of about 3,000 metres.

*       * Recess at 10:35 hours     *       *

The session was resumed at 11:05 hours under the Chairmanship of
Mr. de Bartillat (France). Moving to Agenda Item 7, "Special and future
support projects." he invited the United Kingdom Representative to speak.

    Dr. Robin (U.K.) presented Document 59, stressing that logistics and
research were interdependent, and placed importance on remote sensing
techniques from aircraft and satellites, on the improved equipment of major
stations and the increased use of geophysical station networks for future
development. Using slides, he then described some remote sensing operations
and results, saying that this valuable information as easily obtainable with
good logistic support. The basis of effective logistic support was communi-
cations, especially in regard to meteorological information. He recommended
closer co-operation between the three organizations interested in Antarctic
communications. There also appeared to be a risk that Antarctic logistic
co-operation might be receiving recommendations from two bodies acting
independently -- the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and SCAR.
He hoped that any conflicts of interest would be avoided.

    Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) inquired 1) whether the nature of
the surface influenced the quality of echo sounding results and 2) whether
the instrument could be used on an Otter aircraft.

    Dr. Robin (U.K.) said, in reply to 1), that the surface made very little
difference, and in reply to 2), that the instrument has been used on an Otter,
as well as with other small aircraft, adding that a minimum of two men were
needed for operation, although, for longer flights, 3 or 4 men afforded some
rest period, and he mentioned that some work had been published on work over
Ellesmere Island.

    Mr. Styles (Australia), referring to the recommendation of Dr. Robin (U.K.)
that 50 or 100 tons of fuel be moved to suitable landing strips to assist logis-
tic support by long range aircraft, asked the United States whether they could
spare time for such an operation.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) replied that it depended on the operation-
nal feasibility and safety of the proposed project and its effects on the
programme of the National Science Foundation. Any specific proposal would
have to be studied with these three factors in mind.

    Mr. Victor (France) then said that, since the only justification for
logistics was scientific research, permanent co-ordination between the two
was essential. He regretted the absence of any members of the SCAR Working
Group on Logistics, and concluded by saying that logistic experts should under-
stand the scientific aim of operations for the sake of efficiency.

    Dr. Nagata (Japan) advised closer co-operation between scientists and
government people concerned with Antarctica, and asked Dr. Robin for re-
commendations to improve liaison between SCAR and Antarctic Treaty powers
and WMO.

    Dr. Robin (U.K.) replied that, with regard to logistics, the two bodies
might meet and compare notes. In the case of the present meetings, this
was made practicable by calling the meetings in succeeding weeks. With
regard to communications, the three bodies concerned might set up a single
co-ordinated group with representatives from all three, or perhaps arrange
simultaneous meetings of those concerned, which could work together towards
common conclusions.

The meeting adjourned at 12:25 hours.

Replying, Mr. Victor said that after waiting a month for weather conditions,
the rocket was launched an hour after the decision, and later 3 rockets were
launched in 2½ hours. Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) proposed that those interested in the
rocket programme meet again when the French papers were available.

Chairman Parada (Chile) then returned to the earlier discussion of the
relationships of the Antarctic Treaty parties and SCAR in logistic problems.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) referred to Recommandation IV-24
and said his government's interpretation of "Others experts may be invited
to attend" was that experts from countries other than "Consulative Parties"
may be asked to attend as observer to meetings of Treaty Logistic Experts.
Commenting on the SCAR and Treaty meetings, he said that they should be
separate so that SCAR remains free of governmental pressure. He recognised
that scientific research could depend on logistics and therefore considered
that coordination was necessary between the activities of bodies dealing
with logistic and scientific matters. He thought that a welcome step in
that direction was already achieved in the participation for certain countries
of the same delegates to both meetings of Scarlog and of Treaty Logistic
Experts. He regretted that the agendas of this meeting of Treaty Experts and
of the forthcoming meeting of Scarlog were similar. Many logistic problems -
and in some countries all of them - were a governmental responsibility. One
should avoid that problem of pure logistic be dealt with concurrently or
successively be the two groups. Similar matters should only be discussed in
both groups when scientific considerations are involved in logistics, because
in that case it is not only useful but necessary.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery suggested that SCARLOG meetings should in
future be held several months before Treaty experts meetings and that their
purposes be to advise the group of Treaty Logistic Experts. He also thought
desirable that a permanent rapporteur be appointed for each country with a
view to obtaining closer coordination on the national level between Treaty
experts and scientific and logistic bodies or departments. Finally he

suggested that more frequent meetings be held of Treaty Logistic
Experts. In conclusion, he undertook to report fully to his government
the different views expressed by others delegations on these matters.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) stressed the need for continual exchange of
information and discussion. He considered that this had been and would
continue to be possible within the framework of SCAR. On the other hand, i-
seemed that there was no mechanism within the Treaty organization whereby
this could be done. He added that it did not seem desirable to have two
organizations handling the same matters especially as a majority of the
representatives attending either type of meeting were likely to be the same
persons.

Dr. Roberts (U.K.) commented on three points that had been raised:
(i) There had been complaints that information exhanged by governments
did not reach those who are primarily concerned. The distribution to those
who need it of information exchanged between governments under Article
VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty must be an internal matter for each country.
(ii) Commenting on the suggestion by Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium)
that only governments could appropriately deal with logistic questions, he
recalled that all Treaty recommendations must be unanimous before any actio:
can be taken, and that they do not become binding until approved by all
twelve governments. This can result in a two-year delay, which is quite
unrealistic for recommendations on subjects like telecommunications. Less for
discussions which do not bind governments to act would be much more effectiv
(iii) There are risks in any attempt to bring the Treaty governments and
SCAR too closely together. SCAR's freedom to act so successfully stems fro:
the fact that it operates under the protection of the Treaty and has been
sheltered from political difficulties. It is most important to preserve
this freedom from political interference with the scientific work. But this
should not obscure the need to bring scientists and logisticians together.

Mr. Joubert (South Africa) stated that in his opinion SCAR should act
independently, and mentioned the liaison solution of a co-ordinating commit-
tee used in his country. Regarding closer cooperation between countries, he
thought this should be left to the countries themselves.

Mr. Victor (France) thought that Baron de Gerlache de Gomory's sugges-
tion was constructive. The SCAR logistics group could be used in an advisory
capacity for Antarctic Treaty meetings concerned with problems of logistics.
:embers of the SCAR group, who, as scientists, used logistics, seemed able
to reach decisions without referring them to Governments, although there
were clearly some dicisions which could be made only at governmental level.
It seemed desirable to have SCAR keep the question under study and make re-
commendations at an Antarctic Treaty meeting. This would need to be covered
at a Treaty Meeting.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) stated that commitment of resources was
a governmental problem, not an advisory one.

Dr. Nagata (Japan) stated that it would be better to make Minutes to
be conveyed to the following Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in
November, rather than vote for any proposal.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) said that he had hoped for dis-
cussion on the problem of the duplication of the agenda of this and the
SCARLOG. meeting, as well as on the frequency of Meeting of Treaty Experts.

Mr. Victor (France) expressed his agreement with Dr. Nagata's view
calling for exchange of opinions without submitting recommendations.

Dr. Nagata, in his capacity as chairman of the opening and closing
sessions, suggested that the conclusions of the meeting should be included
in the report and that the matter should be referred to the Drafting Commi-
tte. This was agreed, and Mr. Parada (Chile) closed the afternoon session.

Chairman Parada (Chile) closed the discussion of Agenda Item 7.

Chairman Thomson (New Zealand) asked the Secretary to arrange the
presentation of French film: Terre Adélie Année Spatiale No. 1.

Chairman Nagata (Japan) called the session to order at 09:50 hours
and reported that the Drafting Committee had met twice, on Thursday
evening and Saturday morning, and that as a result of its discussions, amend
ments to the original draft had been made. He then asked Secretary Kusunoki
to read the the amended draft report. (See the text attached.)

Referring to the second draft which had previously been circulated,
Chairman Nagata (Japan) reported (1) that paragraphs one and two had been
adopted at the second Drafting Committee meeting without aedments, (2) that
a figure "59" had been inserted between the words "and" at the end of the
first line of paragraph three and "papers" at the beginning of its second
line, (3) that then a new sentence "These papers will be transmitted to
participating governments" had been added after the first sentence of para-
graph three, (4) that paragraph four had been adopted with no corrections no
amendments, (5) that the words following the word "support" of the third lir.
of paragraph five--namely, "arrangements, and discussions of the principles
underlying current and proposed arrangements"--had been deleted and that
a new sentence "The principles governing logistic support were also dis-
cussed" had been added after the first sentence of paragraph five, and (6) :
paragraph six had been adopted without amendments.

On the suggestion of Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium), Mr. de
Bartillat (France) read the text of the report in French.

Mr. Parada (Chile), referring to Rule 22 and 23 of the Rules of Procedu:
wanted to know who will translate the report into Spanish and Russian and
when. He then added that under these rules, the Meeting also had to approve
the Spanish and the Russian versions of the report.

The session was resumed at 11:05 hours under the Chairmanship of
Mr. de Bartillat (France). Moving to Agenda Item 7, "Special and future
support projects." he invited the United Kingdom Representative to speak.

Dr. Robin (U.K.) presented Document 59, stressing that logistics and
research were interdependent, and placed importance on remote sensing
techniques from aircraft and satellites, on the improved equipment of major
stations and the increased use of geophysical station networks for future
development. Using slides, he then described some remote sensing operations
and results, saying that this valuable information as easily obtainable with
good logistic support. The basis of effective logistic support was communi-
cations, especially in regard to meteorological information. He recommended
closer co-operation between the three organizations interested in Antarctic
communications. There also appeared to be a risk that Antarctic logistic
co-operation might be receiving recommendations from two bodies acting
independently -- the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and SCAR.
He hoped that any conflicts of interest would be avoided.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) inquired 1) whether the nature of
the surface influenced the quality of echo sounding results and 2) whether
the instrument could be used on an Otter aircraft.

Dr. Robin (U.K.) said, in reply to 1), that the surface made very little
difference, and in reply to 2), that the instrument has been used on an Otter,
as well as with other small aircraft, adding that a minimum of two men were
needed for operation, although, for longer flights, 3 or 4 men afforded some
rest period, and he mentioned that some work had been published on work over
Ellesmere Island.

Mr. Styles (Australia), referring to the recommendation of Dr. Robin (U.K.)
that 50 or 100 tons of fuel be moved to suitable landing strips to assist logis-
tic support by long range aircraft, asked the United States whether they could
spare time for such an operation.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) replied that it depended on the operation-
nal feasibility and safety of the proposed project and its effects on the
programme of the National Science Foundation. Any specific proposal would
have to be studied with these three factors in mind.

Mr. Victor (France) then said that, since the only justification for
logistics was scientific research, permanent co-ordination between the two
was essential. He regretted the absence of any members of the SCAR Working
Group on Logistics, and concluded by saying that logistic experts should under-
stand the scientific aim of operations for the sake of efficiency.

Dr. Nagata (Japan) advised closer co-operation between scientists and
government people concerned with Antarctica, and asked Dr. Robin for re-
commendations to improve liaison between SCAR and Antarctic Treaty powers
and WMO.

Dr. Robin (U.K.) replied that, with regard to logistics, the two bodies
might meet and compare notes. In the case of the present meetings, this
was made practicable by calling the meetings in succeeding weeks. With
regard to communications, the three bodies concerned might set up a single
co-ordinated group with representatives from all three, or perhaps arrange
simultaneous meetings of those concerned, which could work together towards
common conclusions.

discusses the usefulness of the weather satellite in determining the formation
of weather systems in Antarctica and over the ocean areas. Though a tech-
nique of great promise, the weather satellite, in its present stage of develop-
ment, is supplementary to other observation techniques, which must also contri-
bute to flight forecasting procedures.

In reply to Mr. Styles' question concerning the design of the satellite
system, Capt. Bernstein (U.S.A.) said there were two types of antenna, the
helix and the omni-directional, the former being superior but more expensive.
In response to a further question, Adm. Abbot (U.S.A.) said that an infra-
red read-out had been planned for U.S. operations but experience had been
obtained with infra-red data. Answering Dr. Nagata's question, Adm. Abbot
said that the time-schedule for the orbits and other information could be
obtained from the centre in Suitland, Maryland.

In the absence of any other questions, Chairman Parada (Chile) invited
the United States to present its next paper.

Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) presented Document 61 by Mr. Jenny and himself con-
cerning the feasibility of establishing unmanned, automated geophysical
observatories for communicating data directly to U.S.A. Slides illustrated
the discussion, which summarizes a more detailed paper by the Radio Science
Laboratories, Stanford University. The system which is being considered by
the United States will utilize radio isotope thermal-electric or wind-driven
generators to supply about 65 watts of power to the automatic station. The
station, recording a full complement of upper atmosphere geophysical pheno-
mena, will transmit the data to the United States by way of synchronous communi-
cation satellite.

                                                        Dumont d'Urville promising to distribute the relevant documents when they
                                                        were available. He said further information would be obtainable form the
                                                        National Committee on Space Studies in Paris. In answer to Dr. Nagata's
                                                        question he continued by giving a description of the system of preparing
                                                        the rockets for launching, Dr. Nagata (Japan) then asked what the elapsed

was between the decision to launch a rocket and the actual launching.
Replying, Mr. Victor said that after waiting a month for weather conditions,
the rocket was launched an hour after the decision, and later 3 rockets were
launched in 2½ hours. Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) proposed that those interested in the
rocket programme meet again when the French papers were available.

Chairman Parada (Chile) then returned to the earlier discussion of the
relationships of the Antarctic Treaty parties and SCAR in logistic problems.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) referred to Recommandation IV-24
and said his government's interpretation of "Others experts may be invited
to attend" was that experts from countries other than "Consulative Parties"
may be asked to attend as observer to meetings of Treaty Logistic Experts.
Commenting on the SCAR and Treaty meetings, he said that they should be
separate so that SCAR remains free of governmental pressure. He recognised
that scientific research could depend on logistics and therefore considered
that coordination was necessary between the activities of bodies dealing
with logistic and scientific matters. He thought that a welcome step in
that direction was already achieved in the participation for certain countries
of the same delegates to both meetings of Scarlog and of Treaty Logistic
Experts. He regretted that the agendas of this meeting of Treaty Experts and
of the forthcoming meeting of Scarlog were similar. Many logistic problems -
and in some countries all of them - were a governmental responsibility. One
should avoid that problem of pure logistic be dealt with concurrently or
successively be the two groups. Similar matters should only be discussed in
both groups when scientific considerations are involved in logistics, because
in that case it is not only useful but necessary.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery suggested that SCARLOG meetings should in
future be held several months before Treaty experts meetings and that their
purposes be to advise the group of Treaty Logistic Experts. He also thought
desirable that a permanent rapporteur be appointed for each country with a
view to obtaining closer coordination on the national level between Treaty
experts and scientific and logistic bodies or departments. Finally he

- 55 -

suggested that more frequent meetings be held of Treaty Logistic
Experts. In conclusion, he undertook to report fully to his government
the different views expressed by others delegations on these matters.

Sir Vivian Fuchs (U.K.) stressed the need for continual exchange of
information and discussion. He considered that this had been and would
continue to be possible within the framework of SCAR. On the other hand, i
seemed that there was no mechanism within the Treaty organization whereby
this could be done. He added that it did not seem desirable to have two
organizations handling the same matters especially as a majority of the
representatives attending either type of meeting were likely to be the same
persons.

Dr. Roberts (U.K.) commented on three points that had been raised:
(i) There had been complaints that information exhanged by governments
did not reach those who are primarily concerned. The distribution to those
who need it of information exchanged between governments under Article
VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty must be an internal matter for each country.
(ii) Commenting on the suggestion by Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium)
that only governments could appropriately deal with logistic questions, he
recalled that all Treaty recommendations must be unanimous before any actio:
can be taken, and that they do not become binding until approved by all
twelve governments. This can result in a two-year delay, which is quite
unrealistic for recommendations on subjects like telecommunications. Less for
discussions which do not bind governments to act would be much more effectiv
(iii) There are risks in any attempt to bring the Treaty governments and
SCAR too closely together. SCAR's freedom to act so successfully stems fro:
the fact that it operates under the protection of the Treaty and has been
sheltered from political difficulties. It is most important to preserve
this freedom from political interference with the scientific work. But this
should not obscure the need to bring scientists and logisticians together.

Mr. Joubert (South Africa) stated that in his opinion SCAR should act
independently, and mentioned the liaison solution of a co-ordinating commit-
tee used in his country. Regarding closer cooperation between countries, he
thought this should be left to the countries themselves.

Mr. Victor (France) thought that Baron de Gerlache de Gomory's sugges-
tion was constructive. The SCAR logistics group could be used in an advisory
capacity for Antarctic Treaty meetings concerned with problems of logistics.
:embers of the SCAR group, who, as scientists, used logistics, seemed able
to reach decisions without referring them to Governments, although there
were clearly some dicisions which could be made only at governmental level.
It seemed desirable to have SCAR keep the question under study and make re-
commendations at an Antarctic Treaty meeting. This would need to be covered
at a Treaty Meeting.

Rear Adm. Abbot, Jr. (U.S.A.) stated that commitment of resources was
a governmental problem, not an advisory one.

Dr. Nagata (Japan) stated that it would be better to make Minutes to
be conveyed to the following Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in
November, rather than vote for any proposal.

Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) said that he had hoped for dis-
cussion on the problem of the duplication of the agenda of this and the
SCARLOG. meeting, as well as on the frequency of Meeting of Treaty Experts.

Mr. Victor (France) expressed his agreement with Dr. Nagata's view
calling for exchange of opinions without submitting recommendations.

Dr. Nagata, in his capacity as chairman of the opening and closing
sessions, suggested that the conclusions of the meeting should be included
in the report and that the matter should be referred to the Drafting Commi-
tte. This was agreed, and Mr.Parada (Chile) closed the afternoon session.

Chairman Parada (Chile) closed the discussion of Agenda Item 7.

Chairman Thomson (New Zealand) asked the Secretary to arrange the
presentation of French film: Terre Adélie Année Spatiale No. 1.

Chairman Nagata (Japan) called the session to order at 09:50 hours
and reported that the Drafting Committee had met twice, on Thursday
evening and Saturday morning, and that as a result of its discussions, amend
ments to the original draft had been made. He then asked Secretary Kusunoki
to read the the amended draft report. (See the text attached.)

Referring to the second draft which had previously been circulated,
Chairman Nagata (Japan) reported (1) that paragraphs one and two had been
adopted at the second Drafting Committee meeting without aemdments, (2) that
a figure "59" had been inserted between the words "and" at the end of the
first line of paragraph three and "papers" at the beginning of its second
line, (3) that then a new sentence "These papers will be transmitted to
participating governments" had been added after the first sentence of para-
graph three, (4) that paragraph four had been adopted with no corrections no
amendments, (5) that the words following the word "support" of the third lir.
of paragraph five--namely, "arrangements, and discussions of the principles
underlying current and proposed arrangements"--had been deleted and that
a new sentence "The principles governing logistic support were also dis-
cussed" had been added after the first sentence of paragraph five, and (6) :
paragraph six had been adopted without amendments.

On the suggestion of Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium), Mr. de
Bartillat (France) read the text of the report in French.

Mr. Parada (Chile), referring to Rule 22 and 23 of the Rules of Procedu:
wanted to know who will translate the report into Spanish and Russian and
when. He then added that under these rules, the Meeting also had to approve
the Spanish and the Russian versions of the report.

Mr. Styles (Australia) observed that the Meeting was asked to approve 
the report, not its translation.

Mr. de Bartillat (France), referring to the French version of the 
draft report, suggested that the phrase at the beginning of the fourth 
sentence of paragraph six "They expressed the feeling . . . "be amended 
to read: "They feel . . ." Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium) agreed 
to the proposed amendment to the French Version.

Mr. Parada (Chile) asked again who would translate the report into 
Spanish and Russian, and Secretary Kusunoki (Japan) reported that the 
Secretariat had translated the report into Spanish and Russian and invited 
the Spanish-speaking delegates to comment on it.

Mr. Areggi (Argentina) indicated that he would be happy to help the 
Secretariat in the translation.

On the suggestion of Baron de Gerlache de Gomery (Belgium), Chairman 
Nagata (Japan) announced that the title of this document had been amended to 
"Final Report."

In response to Mr.de Bartillat's (France) question, Secretary Misumi 
reported that the full report, referred to in the Final Report, would be 
ready by the beginning of October.

In the absence of further comments, Chairman Nagata (Japan) declared 
the Final Report adopted.

He then asked Secretary Kusunoki (Japan) to read the draft press communi-
que to be released to the press, local as well as foreign, and added that lists of 
participants and of papers would be attached to the communique. Secretary 
Kusunoki (Japan) read the text of the communique.

In the absence of any comments on the communique, Chairman Nagata(Japan) 
declared the communique approved, and he then asked if any one wishes to 
speak on other business.

Mr. Smith (U.S.A.) expressed, on behalf of the participating delegations, 
their joint gratitude to the Chairman, the Secretary General, the Secretaries 
and to the members of the Secretariat for the most admirable and efficient 
arrangements they had made for the Meeting.

On the proposal of Mr. Styles (Australia), the Meeting decided to send 
the following message to all Antarctic stations:

"The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Logistics which has met 
in Tokyo, from 3rd to 8th June, sends its greetings to personnel of all 
Antarctic stations. It hopes that the fruitful exchanges of views which have 
taken place will serve to improve logistic arrangements on which scientific 
achievements in Antarctic depends".

Chairman Nagata (Japan) then took the occasion to express, on behalf of 
his Government, his sincere thanks to all of the participating delegations 
for their very friendly and kind cooperation.

The Meeting was closed at 10:20 hours.
