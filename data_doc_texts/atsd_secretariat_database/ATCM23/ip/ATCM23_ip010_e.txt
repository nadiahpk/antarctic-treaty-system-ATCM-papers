XXIII ATCM – Information Paper 
 
A Summary of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), 
Audits/reviews and Related Documents  
Prepared for Activities in Antarctica 
 
 
 
 
 
At ATCM XXI in Christchurch, N. Z, Norway, as host country for ATCM XXII, 
offered to provide and updated list of environmental impact assessments, audits/reviews and 
associated guidance documents for that meeting. 
 
 
 
The following tables list and summarize information on Initial Environmental 
Evaluations (IEEs), Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs), Environmental 
reviews and Audits and other EIA related documents prepared to cover activities in 
Antarctica. 
 
 
 
The information in the tables is based largely on papers prepared for previous 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings by the United Kingdom(XVIII ATCM/Info.9, XIX 
ATCM/Info.15, XX ATCM/Info.8), New Zealand (XXI ATCM/Info.57) and Norway (XXII 
ATCM/Info. 24 Rev.2), as well as a subsequent update to December 1998 based on input 
from the Treaty Parties.
