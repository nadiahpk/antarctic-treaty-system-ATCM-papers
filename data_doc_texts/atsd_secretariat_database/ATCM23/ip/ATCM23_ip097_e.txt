IAATO ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 1

THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ANTARCTICA TOUR OPERATORS
(IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities to the XXIII ATCM, Lima, Peru, 24
May - 4 June 1999 in relation to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty

IAATO is dedicated to appropriate, safe and environmentally sound private-sector travel to
the Antarctic. Over the last year IAATO has focused its activities in several key areas,
including improved exchange of information among its members, emergency response and
contingency planning, and the role of IAATO relative to larger cruise vessels in the Antarctic.
Liaison with national Antarctic programs, scientific and environmental organizations, is an
important objective of IAATO and its members.

1.  Introduction

1.1 Founded by seven private tour operators in 1991, the International Association of
    Antarctica Tour Operators has grown to include 30 member and associate member
    companies in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Germany, Japan,
    Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. A current
    Membership Directory is included with this report (ATTACHMENT A).

1.2 Antarctic tourism has grown along with IAATO. From November 1998 to March
    1999, a total of 10,026 persons traveled to the Antarctic on privately organized
    expeditions, including 9,857 passengers aboard commercially organized ships, 90
    persons on chartered yachts and 79 land-based visitors. This continues a trend,
    representing a slight increase over the total of 9,604 visitors and 9,378 ship-borne
    visitors in the 1997-98 season. An overview of Antarctic tourism activity is presented
    as a separate information paper to the XXIII ATCM under agenda item 13.

1.3 IAATO held a general meeting on 15-17 July 1998 in Arlington, Virginia, USA,
    attended by 19 IAATO members representing 14 Antarctic tour operators. In addition
    observers and experts participated from the U.S. National Science Foundation,
    COMNAP, International Hydrographic Office (IHO), Australian National Antarctic
    program (ANARE), British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Government of South Georgia,
    and the German Federal Environment Agency and other organizations.

1.4 IAATO will hold its 10th general meeting in Hamburg at the offices of IAATO-
    Member Hapag Lloyd Seetouristik, 27 June - 01 July 1999. This will be the first time
    IAATO will hold its annual meeting outside the United States, marking the growing
    international nature of Antarctic tourism and IAATO. The meeting will include a visit
    to the Antarctic expedition vessel M/S Hanseatic, which will be in port, and a visit to
    the Alfred Wegener Institute. Interested parties should contact the IAATO Secretariat.

1.5 IAATO representatives and members attended the July 1998 COMNAP meeting, a
    meeting on visitor management in the Ross Sea, a public meeting with the U.S.
    Environmental Protection Agency, meetings with the German Department of the
    Environment, a World Wildlife Fund conference on Arctic tourism and other
IAATO ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 2

international meetings.

2. Membership

2.1 At its July 1998 meeting, IAATO reviewed the membership status of Adventure 
Associates (AUS), Clipper Cruise Line (USA), Pelagic Expeditions (UK) and Special 
Expeditions (USA), all of whom were elected as full members after one year as 
provisional members of IAATO, a category reserved for new members.

2.2 No new tour operators applied for membership at the July 1998 annual meeting 
although incentives for membership by yacht owners, the status of associate members 
and the issue of companies operating ships carrying more than 400 passengers was 
discussed at length. According to the 1991 IAATO Bylaws, IAATO member 
companies agree to carry no more than 400 passengers per voyage. The role of 
IAATO in relation to larger vessels and the 400-passenger limit will be discussed at 
the Hamburg general meeting of IAATO members.

2.3 As a matter of principle and in practice, all tour operators - whether or not associated 
with IAATO - are included in emergency contact information, exchange of 
information and other activities of the IAATO Secretariat.

3. Field Coordination

3.1 As part of its annual exchange of operational information, IAATO compiles and 
distributes Vessel Call Data (ATTACHMENT B). Contact information for private 
camps (ANI), tour vessels and yachts is included in the Antarctic Communications 
Directory (MINIATOM) compiled and distributed by the COMNAP Secretariat.

3.2 In addition, preliminary cruise itineraries are compiled by the IAATO Secretariat and 
distributed to Antarctic tour operators and national Antarctic programs via COMNAP.

3.3 Expedition leaders and ship's officers circulate advance itineraries and maintain 
regular contact throughout the season to coordinate site visits and exchange general 
information, a key factor in managing Antarctic tourism and mitigating any potential 
environmental impact. An example of the annual instructions to ships' captains, radio 
officers and expedition leaders is included here. (ATTACHMENT C).

3.4 This ongoing and routine contact between vessels and with the Adventure Network 
Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response office in Punta Arenas (EMER) is also 
a key component of effective emergency response.

4. Environmental Impact Assessment
IAATO ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 3

4.1   According to information received by the IAATO Secretariat, all IAATO members 
      prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment of planned activities for the 1998-99 
      season, which were submitted to appropriate national authorities in accordance with 
      national procedures, including documents submitted to authorities in Australia, New 
      Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States.

4.2   IAATO, its members and particularly Toronto-based Marine Expeditions urge non-
      Consultative parties to the Antarctic Treaty such as Canada to ratify the 
      Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty.

5.    Procedures to Prevent the Introduction of Alien Species

5.1   IAATO participated in the Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife workshop hosted by the 
      Australian Antarctic Division (Hobart, Oct 1998), a report of which was distributed to 
      Antarctic tour operators along with the poster produced by the workshop.

5.2   Recognizing that tourists are a highly mobile population in the Antarctic, visiting a 
      number of sites within a short time, IAATO looks forward to continuing advice from 
      SCAR and experts on the best practices to avoid transfer of exotic organisms to 
      Antarctica and translocation of organisms between sites.

5.3   Pending further research, IAATO intends to adopt a standard protocol to report any 
      high mortality incidents and to avoid the introduction and translocation of alien 
      diseases. Comments on the draft procedures (ATTACHMENT D) should be directed 
      to the IAATO Secretariat.

6.    Reporting of Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities

6.1   Antarctic tour operators made use of a standard reporting form as noted by ATCM 
      XXII (Final Report, Annex J).

6.2   IAATO strongly supports the continued use of this single form, which reduces the 
      burden of paperwork and facilitates studies of the scope, frequency and intensity of 
      tourist activities. As part of its ongoing work, IAATO is investigating the 
      development of a database version of the form that will facilitate compilation and 
      analysis of tour data.

6.3   Antarctic tourism trends as compiled by the U.S. National Science Foundation since 
      1989 presented to this meeting as part of the Information paper, "IAATO Overview of 
      Tourism Activities." This information is also posted online at www.iaato.org.

7.    Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1
7.1 In consultation with COMNAP, individual national Antarctic programs and 
consultants, IAATO continues to research, develop and use industry-wide programs 
and standards wherever necessary to ensure self-sufficiency and proper conduct in the 
Antarctic.

7.2 These initiatives include a medical evacuation contingency plan, standard medical 
information, slide presentation on "Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic," and a 
standardized table of contents for training materials and handbooks. IAATO values its 
growing and constructive dialogue with COMNAP on these operational issues.

7.3 A pre-season checklist is appended to this report, indicating the kind of educational 
materials prepared and distributed by IAATO each Antarctic season. 
(ATTACHMENT E).

7.4 Recommendation XVIII-1, "Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic" has been 
translated and made available to tour operators in English, Chinese (Mandarin), 
French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish.

8.  Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning

8.1 Following Resolution 1 (1997), IAATO presented a report on emergency response 
and contingency planning (ATCM XXII/IP104). At the July 1998 meeting, the 
Maritime Committee identified several areas that may not be already covered in detail 
by the provisions of the ISM Code (International Safety Management), including 
notification of shore authorities, specialized containment equipment that may be 
required, and specialized training for ship's officers and crew.

8.2 IAATO is seeking advice from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and 
ship operators to examine existing international regulations as they apply to Antarctic 
shipping and to determine where any further work may be needed given the special 
operating conditions and nature of the Antarctic.

8.3 Several IAATO members participated in the "Antarctic Oil Pollution Control Course 
sponsored by the British Antarctic Survey and Oil Spill Response Limited 
(Southhampton, August 20-21, 1998) and the International Oil Spill Conference 
(IOSC, Seattle, March 8-11, 1999).

8.4 IAATO is completing a survey of the types and quantities of fuel carried by Antarctic 
tour vessels, which preliminary research indicates may be a significant factor in 
determining appropriate response in the event of a catastrophic marine pollution 
emergency. Unlike national supply vessels, Antarctic tour vessels do not carry 
quantities of bulk diesel fuel for shore-based generators and no refueling is carried out 
in the Antarctic Treaty Area. Most Antarctic tour vessels use light diesel fuels.

8.5 In addition to the survey of fuels, IAATO is completing a survey of tour vessels and 
specifications and other information that would contribute to a risk assessment of
IAATO ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 5

Antarctic tourism activities.

8.6   IAATO is also seeking advice from experts in the field regarding recommended oil 
      spill containment equipment and collecting the results of a survey of the spill kits 
      currently being carried by tour vessels operating in the Antarctic. In addition, IAATO 
      is seeking advice regarding appropriate specialized oil spill response training.

8.7   Following Resolution 1 (1997), IAATO supports emergency drills and exercises, an 
      example of which is a two-day emergency response exercise for cruise vessels 
      operating in Glacier Bay, Alaska (March 22-23, 1999). IAATO members who also 
      operate in Alaska participated in these exercises. Adventure Network International 
      (ANI) which provides Search and Rescue and Emergency Medical Evacuation for 
      IAATO members, participated in an emergency response drill this season with the 
      British Antarctic Survey. IAATO looks forward to joint exercises, both practical and 
      theoretical, involving national and private operators.

8.8   All IAATO member companies have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans 
      (SOPEP) in place that satisfy regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL. A "Special 
      Antarctic Addendum" to the SOPEP was developed by IAATO and distributed to 
      Antarctic tour operators for implementation and comment in 1998. While the 
      addendum has no legal status, it includes notice to contact Antarctic stations in the 
      vicinity of any marine pollution incident along with appropriate national authorities.

9.    1998-99 Scientific and Environmental Research Initiatives

9.1   IAATO member companies continued to provide logistic and scientific support to 
      national Antarctic programs and Antarctic organizations in 1998-99. Tour vessels 
      have provided a cost-effective resource for science and IAATO members the 
      opportunity to assist. More than 100 scientists and others from five Antarctic Treaty 
      Parties and their gear were supported, mainly in transport to and from stations and 
      field areas, in the 1998-99 season. Specific requests for logistic or other support 
      should be made to individual members or the IAATO Secretariat. A current IAATO 
      Membership directory is attached to this report. (ATTACHMENT A).

9.2   Support offered this season included major transfer of personnel for Australian 
      Antarctic program as a result of problems with their supply ship, Aurora Australis. 
      Four personnel and gear were transported from Fremantle to Davis Station, and four 
      from Auster Station to Davis Station, 12 scientists were transported from Davis to 
      Hobart,(including two personnel from the United States Antarctic Program who had 
      worked at Zhongshan Station) to Hobart, and 22 scientists, support personnel, and 
      their gear were transported from Casey Station to Hobart.

9.3   IAATO members also transported one German scientist from Argentina to 
      Bellingshausen Station; two personnel to Jubany Station; four to Great Wall Station; 
      seven plus gear to Bellingshausen for station clean-up, and nine from that station 
      afterwards. Provisions were also donated to the Bellingshausen. Two U.S. scientists
were transported from Ushuaia to Palmer Station. Logistical and planning assistance 
were provided to the Argentine Antarctic Program as part of preparations for 
operating Almirante Brown Station. Support was provided to the Bulgarian Antarctic 
Program in transporting four personnel and gear to and from Livingston Island. Other 
tour vessels in various capacities of support transported an additional 30 personnel.

9.4   Members of the Antarctic Site Inventory Project were provided with accommodations, 
transport and access to visitor sites. Transportation was also provided to members of 
Project Antarctic Conservation.

9.5   In addition to support for Antarctic science and logistics, IAATO members provided 
transport for researchers, personnel and material in the sub-Antarctic, including the 
Falkland Islands, South Georgia, Macquarie island and the New Zealand Sub-
Antarctic Islands.

9.6   Antarctic tour operators and passengers continued their tradition of direct financial 
contributions to organizations active in Antarctica, including the Scott Polar Research 
Institute, UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Antarctic Heritage Trust, South Georgia 
Whaling Museum and Humpback Whale Identification Project.

9.7   According to the annual report of the Antarctic Heritage Trust (31 March 1998), 
$17,368 or 13% of the annual income was provided by per person donations by tour 
operators with itineraries including the historic huts. An additional contribution of 
$16,259 was made through the raffle of a donated Antarctic cruise.

MEMORANDUM

TO    All Antarctic Captains, Expedition Leaders and Radio Officers
FM    IAATO
RE    1998/99 Season

We developed the following notice at the IAATO annual meeting to help guide the exchange of 
information among vessels, co-ordination of itineraries and reporting for the season.

Exchange of Itineraries

-   IAATO members agree to exchange itineraries and coordinate schedules. This is a key factor 
    in self-regulation, monitoring of activities and also in effective emergency response.
-   Consult the IAATO preliminary schedule (and updates circulated by In.Fue.Tur) to 
    determine which vessels will be in your cruising area.
-   Circulate your proposed final itinerary via fax, telex or radio (preferred) or e-mail. (Please 
    note that few tour vessels have regular real-time exchange of e-mail)
-   Itineraries may also be circulated via In.Fuc.Tur but this is a method of last resort. Not all 
    ships call at Ushuaia and the responsibility to circulate information is on individual vessels.
-   Be sure to also exchange environmental information and management recommendations for 
    individual landing sites or other notices with your colleagues as the season progresses.

Itinerary Changes

-   To avoid conflicts, notify vessels in the region of any changes in planned itinerary as soon as 
    practical.
-   Notification can be by fax, telex, VHF or HF (see below).
-   To preserve the spirit of discovery, vessels should also make efforts to stay out of sight of 
    each other.

Landing Priority

-   In general, priority is given to the first vessel that has made its intentions known.
-   In the event of conflict, expedition leaders should coordinate between themselves to 
    determine priority, which is best accomplished through negotiation via HF or VHF.
-   Please resolve any conflicts equitably. It is assumed that vessels visiting a site with some 
    regularity will give way to a vessel that is not but any number of factors may come into play.
-   Two vessels are not to land at the same place at the same time and, to avoid any potential 
    environmental impacts, efforts should be made to spread out visits over time.

Station Visits

-   Tour operators have agreed to provide at least 72 hour-notice of any planned station visit.
-   Follow individual procedures determined by national programs/station leaders.
-   Provide timely notice of cancellation, generally at least 48 hours in advance.
-   Please include any additional station contact information, standard procedures or incidents 
    involving stations in your voyage report to the home office.
ATTACHMENT C / ANNUAL INSTRUCTIONS PAGE 2

Channel 16
- Channel 16 is used for hailing purposes only, NOT general communication.
- After making contact, immediately switch to another channel to continue conversation.
- Expedition Leaders should periodically review radio etiquette with staff. The airwaves during 
the height of the season in the Peninsula have been crowded, an issue with IAATO members 
and potentially with research stations. Take care to follow standard international procedures.

IAATO Radio Schedule
- IAATO members have agreed to implement a twice daily radio schedule.
- All ships should report in with their position/destination at 0700 and 1900 daily 
(Ushuaia local time). Each radio officer should record this information.
- Suggested HF hailing frequencies are: 44146 (1°), 6224 (2°), 8294 (3°), to be finalized by 
radio officers during the season based on experience.
- Expedition leaders should make use of this schedule whenever VHF communication is 
impossible for exchange information. This will reduce communication costs.
- Please switch to another frequency for any extended conversation.

EMER (Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response)
- Review the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan included in your briefing package.
- The reporting scheme indicated above is an integral part of emergency response. Please 
insure that it is followed and report any difficulties to your home office.

Post-Visit Reporting
- Following Antarctic Treaty recommendations, complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the standard 
Post-Visit report for every expedition. This should be the ONLY form completed and it 
should be completed carefully and returned to the office. This information is tabulated and 
circulated internationally.
- Please note guests of the company, guest lecturers, other "non-revenue passengers" should be 
reported as passengers for the purposes of this report unless they have a specific role ashore. 
In general, those responsible for supervising passenger operations ashore who report to the 
expedition leader are considered staff. Your office will provide additional guidance.
- Please use the standard list of "Antarctic Peninsula Region Landing Sites" for Part 2, in 
which case you need not complete the Latitude/Longitude. Please correct duplications or 
inconsistencies. In general, the most specific place name is used.
- Make additions to the list of landing sites as necessary -- taking note of the standard 
procedures included in your briefing packet for assessing new or rarely visited sites.

Have a safe and successful Antarctic season.

Introduction or Detection of Diseases in Antarctic Wildlife, IAATO Perspective

Preamble

Inherent in the mandate of IAATO member companies is a long term commitment to 
environmentally sensitive travel to Antarctica. For a number of years IAATO members, being 
mindful of Environmental Protocol Recommendation XVIII-I, have been using simple 
precautionary techniques to ensure that foreign material and/or potential pathogens are not 
introduced into Antarctica by tourists. In the last several years these procedures have been 
formalized and reviewed by national authorities via Environmental Impact Assessments.

Recognizing that tourists in Antarctica are a highly mobile population and that little is known 
about the introduction and translocation of alien organisms in the Antarctic, IAATO hopes to 
play a continuing active role in responding to new information.

Resulting from the Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife workshop hosted by the Australian Antarctic 
Division (Hobart, Oct 1998), this document is intended to address the concern about the potential 
translocation of diseases by tourists in Antarctica, and to suggest a cost effective, practical 
solution. Given the current lack of scientific data on natural disease status and microbial 
populations of Antarctic wildlife, and of methods to prevent anthropogenic transmission, a 
sensible precautionary approach is proposed.

Antarctic tour operators and staff can be a resource for disease surveillance, reporting and 
containment. Vessels operated by IAATO members cover a wide variety of coastal terrain in a 
short space of time and can provide valuable data to the scientific community on the overall state 
of wildlife populations.

IAATO members have continued to make use of boot-washing stations before and after each 
landing along with a visual check of clothing and gear for any exotic organisms. Following the 
Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife workshop, IAATO researched a simple effective antiseptic which 
could be used to limit possible translocation of diseases, such as in penguin feces, when 
passengers moved from one rookery to another for example.

We were surprised to find that experts in the field do not agree whether any further action is 
required beyond simply washing boots and soiled clothing in clean water. A number of 
researchers suggested that a weak solution of iodine might be a suitable antiseptic. Bearing in 
mind the variance in opinion amongst experts in the field, IAATO suggests the following:

1. PREVENTATIVE ACTION

*   Prior to their first landing in Antarctica, all passengers receive a comprehensive briefing 
    on Antarctic conservation. An integral part of this briefing is explaining the importance 
    of preventing the possible introduction of foreign materials to Antarctica, and the 
    potential for translocation between Antarctic sites.

*   Before each shore visit passengers and staff are asked to check their clothing for seeds 
    and other extraneous material and scrub their boots in a foot bath on the ship's deck.
ATTACHMENT D / IAATO DISEASE PROTOCOL PAGE 2

Given that most voyages depart from Ushuaia and many passengers spend time in Tierra del Fuego before embarkation, the opportunity to transport material to the Antarctic is obvious and a thorough cleaning before the first landing is particularly important.

*   Following each landing for the duration of the voyage, passengers scrub boots at the water's edge prior to boarding Zodiacs and again aboard the ship at the head of the gangway. The foot bath should contain a diluted iodine solution (ratio: three tablespoons of saturated solution to a ten gallon bucket).

*   Disposal of the used iodine solution, which may possibly contain pathogens and is a poison, must be considered. Iodine occurs naturally in the ecosystem and is present in foot bath water in low enough concentrations that it is not considered a threat to the environment. We propose that dirty foot bath water should be disposed into the sea at the place of anchorage at each landing rather than flushed into the ship's tanks. In this way any contaminants acquired at that site will be returned to the waters from which they came, rather than being translocated.

*   Zodiacs are kept clean between landings and care is taken to remove stones, kelp etc. from the floor of the Zodiac after each landing.

*   Helicopter skids and passenger compartments are cleaned between landings using clean sea water.

2. PROCEDURES UPON THE DISCOVERY OF A HIGH MORTALITY EVENT

Antarctic tour vessels can potentially act as monitors of the health of wildlife populations, traveling along coastal areas throughout the Antarctic summer. We are not proposing that IAATO vessels take any formal responsibility of monitoring the health of wildlife populations but rather that IAATO instigates a code of practice for responding to a high mortality event.

While acknowledging that high mortality events are open to interpretation in size and cause, the critical issue is that any perceived, highly unusual event be noted and reported appropriately. In the event of discovering a mortality event, tour operators should:

*   Describe and report the event to the nearest scientific station and ships operating in the area. The national authority that the tour organizer provided advance notification should also be notified and an incident report should be prepared for IAATO.

*   In such a scenario, the primary responsibility of the operator is to say that he/she has seen something unusual.

*   Where the operator has reason to believe that landing passengers could lead to translocation of disease or may otherwise be ill-advised, the landing should be aborted.

*   In the event of a landing being made and a mass mortality event not being recognized, then normal boot scrubbing procedures and adherence to approved landing procedures should be enough to minimize the risk of spreading disease.
