The Training Requirements for Ships’ Officers and on 
Navigation/Communication Equipment for Antarctic Vessels 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
1. 
During discussions at ATCM XXII on the “Safety of Operations in the Antarctic” (Final 
Report ATCM XXII, para 92), COMNAP was requested to develop guidelines on training 
requirements for ships’ officers and crews operating in the Antarctic and provide guidance on 
special navigation/communication equipment requirements. 
 
2. 
COMNAP was requested to circulate the information by October 1998 and report back to 
ATCM XXIII on the results of the survey. 
 
 
FINDINGS 
 
Training Requirements for Ships’ Officers and Crew 
 
3. 
Responses from national operators indicate that all countries depend to a large degree on 
“on the job” training.  In some countries preparation for sailing in Antarctic waters is done through 
a formal course training period. 
 
4. 
There is general support among national operators for international guidance on the training 
of ice navigating officers.   It is considered that the training, whether in a classroom or on the job, 
should cover topics such as: 
 
• 
international policy and Antarctic legislation; 
• 
sea ice, glaciology, Antarctic meteorology and climatology and Antarctic oceanography; 
• 
classification of Antarctic vessels; 
• 
safety of navigation and ship maneuvering in Antarctica; 
• 
helicopter operations from ships; 
• 
protection of the marine and terrestrial environment; and  
• 
ship based operations in the Antarctic. 
 
It is acknowledged that no classroom training can replace practical experience.

Navigation/Communication Equipment 
 
5. 
The general view of national operators is that standard communication equipment, such as 
“Standard 4 – GMDSS”, and satellite receiving facilities in accordance with IMO regulations are 
suitable for ships’ operations in the Antarctic.  Because of the remoteness of Antarctic operations 
the redundancy of communications equipment should be carefully considered. 
 
6. 
The following items of navigation equipment are recommended: 
 
• 
two independent sounding-lead systems; 
• 
two radar systems for 10 cm and 3 cm respectively; 
• 
low altitude radar scanner to identify icebergs in close sea-ice; 
• 
daylight screens for all monitors; and 
• 
a minimum of two floodlight projectors. 
 
7. 
Vessels should also have a meteorological station on board with equipment for receiving 
text forecasts, weather charts and ice information.  The availability of satellite image receiving 
equipment is also highly desirable.  With the growing use if the INTERNET vessels should also 
look towards receiving messages with attachments providing weather and ice data.
