Waste Management at Syowa Station 
 
1. Introduction 
The Japanese Antarctic Research Exhibition (JARE) has appointed the environmental 
staff at Syowa Station and introduced the Waste Management Plan (WMP) to 
implement necessary operating procedures such as segregation, disposal and 
management of wastes after the Madrid Protocol was completed in 1991. According to 
the plan, some wastes are disposed in Syowa and the remaining are taken to Japan.  
 
2. Policy for Waste Management 
The wintering operation is now done only at Syowa among four Japanese stations in 
Antarctica. The summer operation is conducted at Dome Fuji, while field observations 
are currently operated at coastal and inland sites. All wastes produced at stations other 
than Syowa and through field activities are taken back to Syowa and then disposed and 
stored following the WMP. Some combustible wastes are incinerated and sewage is 
treated by the biological treatment plant. The ash and the sludge resulting from the 
treatment are brought back to Japan. Larger wastes such as oversnow vehicles and 
trucks stored at Syowa are also brought back to Japan every year according to the plan. 
 
3. Criteria for Waste Disposal 
Wastes at Syowa are classified: 
 by origin 
   Domestic wastes produced from living 
   Non-domestic wastes produced through observations or logistics 
 Sewage  
 by the ways of disposal   
 sewage to be treated by a biological treatment plant and sludge to be bought back to 
Japan 
 liquid wastes such as medicines and used oil, to be brought back to Japan 
 combustible wastes to be incinerated at Syowa 
 non-combustible wastes and large combustible wastes to be brought back to Japan 
 
Disposal measures are instructed to all members of the party using a detailed waste 
management handbook. All wastes should be segregated to 21 types. The segregeted 
wastes are packed in containers and stored until being brought back to Japan, except 
for wastes to be incinerated. 
 
4. Incineration 
There are two types of incineratiors at Syowa. The ash is brought back to Japan.  
(1) Double-burning incinerator 
   The capacity of fireplace is 0.37m3 and the capacity of burning is 15kg/h. Use for 
combustible wastes. 6,800kg of wastes was incinerated in 1998/99 season. 
  *All of large combustible wastes (wooden package etc.) is brought back to Japan. 
(2) Carbonization system  
   A carbonization system which can process 200 liters at a time is used to compact 
foodstuffs which are more watery. 5,400kg of foodstuffs were disposed for the 1998/99 
season.

5. Sewage disposal 
Hitherto domestic liquid waste has been dumped into the sea from a tank after disposed 
by a greasetrap and human wastes stored in tanks has been cast after stired and diluted 
with water. For further high-grade treatment, installation of contact aeration biological 
treatment plant was planned. A new building of 109m2 was firstly constructed in 1996 
and then instruments for the treatment was installed. The treatment has started to 
operate for a part of the facilities since April 1999. The ability of the plant is shown in 
Table 1.

6. Wastes to be brought back to Japan for 1998/99 season 
The wastes from Syowa are brought back to Japan by the vessel SHIRASE once a year. 
Table 2 shows the wastes to be brought back for the 1998/99 season. 12 tons of wastes 
from Dome Fuji are also included here. Oversnow vehicles and a generator were 
received for exhibition in three museums. This clean up operation started three years 
ago and is under way. Approximately 300 tons of scrapped vehicles and used materials 
are still kept at Syowa Station. About 100 tons of such scraps are planning to bring 
back every year, because the Shiraseâ€™s carrying capacity of large cargo limits the 
transportation.
