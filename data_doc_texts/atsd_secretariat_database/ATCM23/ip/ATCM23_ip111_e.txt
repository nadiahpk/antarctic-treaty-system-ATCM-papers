outcome of discussion at the 71st session of the Maritime Safety Committee 
 
The seventy-first session of the Maritime Safety Committee was held from 19 to 28 May 1999 and considered the 
scope and application of the proposed Code on polar navigation, which is under development in relevant technical 
sub-committees. 
 
2 The following is an abstract from the draft text of the report of MSC 71 which covers the discussion of the 
Committee on this matter. 
 
"Code on polar navigation 
 
9.13 In dealing with the scope and application of the proposed Code on polar navigation as requested by the 
Sub-Committee and other sub-committees concerned, the Committee considered a draft framework for the 
development of the Code, prepared hy the SubCommittee, together with related proposals submitted by the United 
States (MSC 71/2O/11) and other proposals introduced orally, as summarized hereunder. 
 
9.14 In introducing document MSC 71/20/11, the delegation of the United States, supported by a large majority of 
the delegations who spoke, while recognizing the need to protect polar waters and safeguard the lives of the 
travellers in those waters, expressed concern at the proposed code as currently drafted. Firstly, the arbitrary 
application of the provisions north of 60QN and south of 6OQS failed to recognize those locations within these 
areas which are ice-free. The draft code also failed to distinguish between the conditions and nature of shipping in 
the Arctic and those in Antarctica, which is unique in its geography and governance. Further, there were conflicts 
between the draft code and the Antarctic Treaty and UN Law of the Sea Convention, such as the requirement to 
give prior notification to the coastal State when entering its EEZ. The draft code was too detailed in some areas and 
contained a number of clauses which implied mandatory application. Therefore, instead of the proposed code, IMo 
should, as a first step, develop guidelines to be disseminated under cover of an MSC circular, and then reconsider, 
in the light of experience gained with their application, whether such a status should be altered. 
 
9.15 The delegation of Canada, supported by several other delegations, expressed support for the draft code, which 
reflected years of work and discussion and the hard-won consensus of many Members. In its view, all the technical 
and other concerns raised in documentMSC 71/2O/11 had been or could be addressed by the DE correspondence 
group and all the subcommittees involved using a holistic approach, whereby such bodies would consider not only 
the design and equipment aspects but also the operational and human element issues. 
Referring to the perceived conflicts with other international treaties, it stated that, while the Antarctic waters were 
protected by the Antarctic Treaty regime and its Protocols, there was a need to provide harmonized technical 
standards for ships working or transiting all polar waters. 
 
9.16 The Committee, having also debated other related issues (such as the application of the code to ships under 
50O gross tonnage, fishing vessels and barges, and the possibility of splitting the code into distinct parts applying to 
the two polar regions separately), agreed, based on the proposals contained in document MSC 71/2O/11 as 
amplified by the United 
States delegation, to the following framework to be used by the correspondence group and the sub-committees 
involved as a basis for further work on this issue: 
 
.1 recommendatory guidelines should be developed only for SoLAS ships operating in ice-covered waters, for 
dissemination under cover of an MSC circular, unless the DE Sub-Committee agrees that a different format would 
be more appropriate and the Committee so agrees; 
 
.2 the application of the guidelines in areas north of 6OQN should be resolved so that ice-free waters in those areas 
are not covered; 
 
.3 Antarctic waters are to be excluded from the application of the guidelines, unless Antarctic Treaty members 
decide otherwise; 
 
.4 each sub-committee involved should conduct a thorough review of the parts of the guidelines falling under its 
purview to determine what value is being added by establishing the various proposed requirements, whether the 
issues in the guidelines are addressed elsewhere, and the implications of such requirements; 
 
.5 any provisions in the current guidelines, which are inconsistent with international law, including the provision for 
prior notification, should be removed; 
 
.6 any clauses that appear to indicate that they are mandatory should be redrafted in such a way that their 
recommendatory nature is clearly demonstrated; 
 
.7 only provisions additional to existing SoLAS requirements aiming at taking account of the climatic conditions of 
ice-covered waters should be included; 
 
.8 whether or not barges should be included in the guidelines was a matter to be discussed; and 
 
.9 any survey and certification provisions, which might be different to the corresponding SoLAS requirements, 
should also be discussed. 
 
9.17 The Committee instructed the DE (co-ordinator), BLG, FP, CoMSAR, NAV, SLF and STW Sub-Committees 
to conduct their work in this issue in accordance with the approved framework with immediate effect, and invited 
the MEPC to concur with this course of action. It also requested the Secretariat to convey its decisions on the issue 
to the aforementioned sub-committees and to the correspondence group established by DE 41 for appropriate 
action."
