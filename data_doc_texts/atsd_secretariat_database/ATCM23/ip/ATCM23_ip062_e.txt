Alternative Energy at Syowa Station 
- Utilization of Solar and Wind Power - 
 
1. Introduction 
    More electric power generation at Syowa Station is required year after year as a 
result of its expanding research facilities and living space. This growth causes further 
fuel consumption and emission of noxious gas such as nitrogen oxide and carbon 
dioxide. The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition has promoted development of 
alternative energy at Syowa in order to decrease fuel consumption. Photovoltaic panels 
(PV) was introduced and connected to the 300kVA diesel generator. The system has 
been operated since April 1998. A newly designed 10kW wind turbine is also going to 
be set up apart from the main buildings in 2000 and also connected to electrical 
distribution network. At Syowa, there are two summer lodges. Solar wall panels for 
indoor heating was set onto the wooden wall panels of one of summer lodges in 
February 1999. Solar water heaters are planned to be installed on the roof of the two 
buildings in the year 2000.  
         
2. PV Panels 
    Despite an absence of sunlight for about two months (June, July) at Syowa (Fig.1), 
abundant solar energy can be obtained during summer due to the clear sky, the clarity of 
air, the high albedo from the snow surface, and the high efficiency of solar cells in low 
air temperature. Although there is a difference of solar radiation between summer and 
winter in Antarctica, it is not a serious problem taking the consequent decrease of 
annual total fuel use into consideration.  
    The installation of PV panels has been carried out since 1997 and the total amount of 
panels is 30kW up to 1999. The elevation of all panels is 70 degrees from the horizon 
and a single crystal type silicon cell with 13.4% of efficiency is used (Fig. 5). The grid 
connection with the diesel generator started in April 1998; the monthly electricity 
generated by PV panels is shown in Fig. 1. Panels are planned to be added up to 60kW 
by the year 2000, so that 26.6kl of diesel fuel and 18.36 tons of carbon dioxide can be 
cut as shown in Table 1.

   Fig. 2 shows the positioning of the PV panel arrays by year; arrays are added one by 
one annually. The panels were set facing north in 1997 and 1998, and in 1999 panels 
were faced 60 degrees east and west from the north. The same positioning is planned 
after 2000. Monthly energy outputs from PV panels (10kW) facing north and 60 
degrees from the north are shown in Fig. 3. The annual estimated output from 
north-directed panels is 14,434kWh, while the panel with 60 degrees is 12,938 kWh. 
Adopting the positioning of 60 degrees avoids PV output concentration around noon 
and enables electric generation throughout the day, despite that the north-directed 
arrays are more effective. Fig. 4 shows hourly output on a fine day in January, which 
means that this adopted positioning does not require a large power inverter and avoids 
an excessive drop in load of diesel generator consequently.

3. Solar Wall 
    Solar walls are used for supplying warm air into inside the summer lodge by 
attaching them on outer wooden panels of the building. A small circulator attached 
inside the panel sucks the air warmed through the solar walls into the room. Research is 
being conducted by installing the walls onto two buildings of 100m and measuring the 
room temperature. It might be possible to adopt them as a heating system for large 
buildings such as workshop and storage if the test result is satisfactory. 
 
4. Solar Water Heater 
    Solar water heaters will be set up in February 2000 on the roof of the summer lodges 
to supplement a water heating system for the building. The one unit (8,000 X 1,000 X 
2,000 mm) consists of eight solar collectors, the three units will be set up on the roof in 
the elevation of 70 degrees which is the same as the latitude of Syowa. The monthly 
heat capacity of the units was calculated as shown in Table 2. 
The reduction of 4.5kl of the fuel and 3 tons of carbon dioxide will be possible during 
three months in summer by the solar collectors.

 5. Wind Turbine 
   At Syowa, the annual mean wind speed is 6.4m/s and the total amount of frequency 
distribution of wind speed between 5 and 25m/s reaches 50 % as shown in Fig.6.  Winds 
of more than 10m/s come mostly from the north east. The yaw control is not needed 
because of stable wind direction, so that the turbine system can be simple. Taking this 
analysis into consideration, a new wind turbine system has been planned as shown in 
Table 3. This turbine will be installed in Syowa and start test service in January 2000. 
Five units of this system will be connected to the diesel generator grid from 2001 and 
total electricity of about 112MWh/y can afford approximately 9% of the current 
necessary power. It cuts 33.6 tons of fuel a year and 22.4 tons of carbon dioxide.
