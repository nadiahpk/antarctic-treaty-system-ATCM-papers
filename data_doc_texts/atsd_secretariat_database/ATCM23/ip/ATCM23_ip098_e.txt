IAATO OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM ACTIVITIES PAGE 1

The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide 
this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 1998-1999 season and brief overview of Antarctic 
tourism trends. A detailed overview of Antarctic tourism and IAATO is available online at 
www.iaato.org, including the statistics compiled annually by the Office of Polar Programs at 
the U.S. National Science Foundation.

1. Overview

In 1998-99 approximately 10,026 people traveled to the Antarctic on private sector 
expeditions, exceeding for the first time 10,000 travelers. A brief summary of the season, 
"IAATO Overview of Actual Antarctic Tourism, 1998-99," is appended. Of these Antarctic 
visitors, 79 participated in land-based expeditions, 90 traveled aboard commercial yachts and 
9,857 traveled aboard commercially organized tour vessels.

2. Seaborne Tourism

2.1 9,857 people traveled to the Antarctic on 15 commercially organized tour vessels 
from November 1998 to March 1999, a slight increase over the 1997-98 season total 
of 9,473 ship-based visitors.

2.2 IAATO members operated all but one of the Antarctic tour vessels that sailed in 1998-
99. Seven of the 15 vessels were of Russian registry.

2.3 The vast majority of Antarctic voyages are to the Peninsula region during the four-
month Austral summer, departing from Ushuaia or, in fewer numbers, from Punta 
Arenas or Stanley. Of 102 ship voyages in 1998-99: 96 were to the Antarctic 
Peninsula Region; one to East Antarctica; three to the Ross Sea; and two voyages 
including both the Ross Sea Sector and Antarctic Peninsula (Marco Polo, Kapitan 
Khlebnikov).

3.    Commercial Antarctic Yachts

3.1   Based on information received by the IAATO Secretariat, a total of 90 passengers
      were reported to have traveled to Antarctica aboard 11 commercial yachts in the
      1998-99 season. This includes yachts reported at Arthur Harbor by the U.S. National
      Science Foundation, reports made directly to the IAATO Secretariat and information
      gathered by In.Fue.Tur in Ushuaia. Yacht activity - which may be incomplete - is
      included in the statistical summaries and projections appended to this report.

3.2   According to Hamish Laird, captain of the Pelagic, some 225 passengers and crew
      sailed to Antarctica in the 1997-98 season on 25 voyages, 16 of them commercial
      charters. Antarctic yacht activity is compiled annually by Robert Headland at Scott
      Polar Research Institute as part of the ongoing "Chronological List of Antarctic
      Expeditions and Related Historical Events "(extract tabled as XXII ATCM/IP1).

3.3   Regular Commercial yachts with fare paying passengers include the Pelagic (IAATO
      Member, Pelagic Expeditions), Damien II (Sally and Jerome Poncet), Croix St. Paul
      II (Alex Foucard), S. W. Vorwerk, Golden Fleece and yachts organized through
      Croisieres Australes in France (Baltazar, Boulard, Fernande, Kekilistrion, Kotick I,
      Valhalla)

3.4   The IAATO Secretariat is in regular correspondence with yacht operators and other
      interested parties regarding Antarctic yacht activity and outreach to the yachting
      community has improved with several yacht captains and owners participating at the
      IAATO annual meeting. Yacht operator Pelagic Expeditions is an IAATO member.

4.    Land-based Tourism

4.1   IAATO charter member Adventure Network International (ANI) operated out of
      Punta Arenas, Chile for the fourteenth consecutive season. It operated one Lockheed
      L-382 G Hercules and two DHC-6 Twin Otters. The ANI camp at Patriot Hills blue
      icefield in the Heritage Range (80° 18'S, 81° 21' W) was reopened on 01 November
      1998 and closed on 15 February 1999.

4.2   There were a total of 12 Hercules flights this season, five of which were used to carry
      passengers with the remaining flights used for the transportation of fuel for the
      company's operations. The total number of passengers carried was 79, including 15
      visitors to Patriot Hills, 9 to the Emperor Penguin colony at the Dawson-Lambton
      Glacier, 11 to the South Pole, 31 mountaineers on Vinson Massif and 3 others
      climbing peaks in the Ellsworth Mountains.

4.3   ANI supported 4 separate private expeditions: a team of two Dutch (Ronald Naar and
IAATO OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM ACTIVITIES PAGE 3

Coen Hofstede), who attempted a crossing of the Antarctic continent from Dronning 
Maud Land to McMurdo. Due to weather and equipment problems their journey was 
terminated just past the South Pole; the Groupe Militaire de Haute Montagne (a five-
man French army expedition) skied unsupported to the South Pole from Berkner 
Island; Ola Skinnarmo, a Swede, successfully skied solo and unsupported to the South 
Pole from Hercules Inlet, becoming the youngest person to do so; and Mitsuro Ohba, 
a Japanese citizen, skied/sailed solo from Dronning Maud Land through the South 
Pole to 76.37°S, 96.78°W near the Fletcher Peninsula.

5. Overflights

5.1 Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia, operated Qantas Antarctic Day Sightseeing 
flights from Melbourne aboard Qantas Airlines Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the fifth 
consecutive season. According to the Australian Antarctic Division, a total of 3,127 
passengers participated on 9 flights from November 1998 to February 1999. In 
addition, the plane carried 23 crew per flight.

5.2 The aircraft operate mainly to the north Victoria Land coast region, and occasionally 
to Wilkes Land and as far west as Princess Elizabeth Land (Ingrid Christensen Coast)

5.3 Over 13,000 persons have taken part in the overflights since they re-commenced in 
1994-1995. Croydon Travel expects to operate 10 flights in the 1999-2000 season to 
the same areas detailed above.

5.4 In addition, overflights of the Antarctic Peninsula from Punta Arenas, Chile have been 
offered for several seasons. According to Destination Management, a Chilean agency 
that provides ground services to cruise vessels and other tour companies, at least 22 
flights took place between November 1998 and March 1999, each carrying 40-60 
passengers and staff including an Antarctic lecturer. The flights have been offered 
aboard Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Avant, a Chilean carrier. The flights are 
offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers calling at Punta Arenas.

6. Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 1999-2000 Season

6.1 According to information provided by tour operators to IAATO, 13,906 people may 
visit Antarctica on commercially organized tour vessels, 200 on land-based 
expeditions and 192 on commercial yachts in the 1999-00 season. As many as an 
additional 1,000 passengers may visit Antarctica on a 72-hour cruise only transit of 
the Antarctic Treaty Area on an around the world voyage aboard the Rotterdam. This 
will be the biggest season ever for Antarctic tourism, as forecast by IAATO (XXI 
ATCM/IP25), and attributable in part to the overall surge in travel related to the 
Millennium. The "IAATO Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism, 1999-00" is 
appended.

6.2 As a matter of interest, Holland America Line has submitted an Initial Environmental 
Evaluation for its planned activities aboard the Rotterdam to the U.S. Environmental
IAATO OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM ACTIVITIES PAGE 4

Protection Agency, which was determined to meet obligations under the 
Environmental Protocol and U.S. Law. The World Cruise Company, based in 
Toronto, is preparing an Environmental Impact Assessment for its activities aboard 
the Ocean Explorer I and Aegean I to be submitted to appropriate national authorities.

6.3     The Rotterdam is registered in the Netherlands. According the Initial Environmental 
Evaluation submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the ship will 
spend approximately 72 hours in the Antarctic Treaty Area on a cruise-only program 
with no small boat cruising or landings.

6.4     The Ocean Explorer I and Aegean I are both Greek registered vessels. Each vessel 
will visit the South Shetland Islands as one stop on an around-the-world voyage. 
During these voyages, the Aegean I is expected to carry approximately 500 
passengers and the Ocean Explorer I approximately 600 passengers. Each vessel will 
be in the Antarctic Treaty Area for approximately 36 hours. Both vessels will also 
participate in a 7-day millennium cruise, with approximately 48 hours scheduled in 
the South Shetland Islands. On these voyages, the Aegean I is expected to carry 
approximately 450 passengers and the Ocean Explorer I approximately 250 
passengers. Planned activities will be provided in more detail in the Environmental 
Impact Assessment under preparation by the tour organizer.

6.5     Marine Expeditions, an experienced Antarctic tour operator and IAATO member, will 
assist in coordinating staffing and marine operations for the two vessels. According to 
information received by the IAATO Secretariat, the Antarctic cruises aboard the 
Ocean Explorer I and Aegean I are in celebration of the Millennium. In future years, 
The World Cruise Company has announced that it plans one visit per year on one 
vessel.

6.6     In other noteworthy changes for the coming season, an Australian company, Peregrine 
Expeditions plans nine voyage aboard the Boris Petrov, a 52-passenger Russian-
flagged vessel that had previously sailed in the Antarctic. Peregrine Expeditions, 
which has applied for IAATO membership, has sponsored voyages in the Antarctic 
since 1996. IAATO-member Marine Expeditions will replace the Disko, a 120-
passenger Danish-flagged vessel, with the Lyubov Orlova, a 120 passenger Russian 
operated vessel with Malta registry. The Lyubov Orlova is a sister ship of the 
Antarctic tour vessel Clipper Adventurer (ex Alla Tarasova). The 110-passenger 
Russian-flagged icebreaker, Kapitan Dranitsyn, operated by Quark Expeditions will 
also return to the Antarctic after an absence of several seasons.

7.      Antarctic Tourism Trends

7.1     For the past decade, the U.S. National Science Foundation has compiled and 
distributed detailed information on Antarctic tour activity. IAATO collaborates with 
NSF to ensure that all Antarctic tourism is represented, not just that of U.S. 
organizers. The United States has submitted this information on tourism trends at a 
previous consultative meeting (XXI ATCM/INF 90). Appendices include the 
following eight tables and charts compiled by NSF and revised by IAATO to reflect
IAATO OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM ACTIVITIES PAGE 5

the 1998-99 season wherever possible. Updated charts and tables reflecting the 1998-
99 season are currently in preparation by NSF. This data is an invaluable resource,
showing tourism activity at individual landing sites over time.

C. Antarctic Tourist Trends
D. Antarctic Tourism, Ship vs. Land Based
E. Projected Trends in Antarctic Tourism
F. Comparison of Nationalities (1994/95 - 1997/98)
G. 1997-98 Summary of Peninsula Sites Visited by Tour Ships
H. Nine Season (1989-98) Overview of Sites Visited in the Antarctic Peninsula
I. 1997-98 Summary of Continental Sites Visited by Tour Ships
J. Overview of Sites Visited - Continental Side of Antarctica (1992/93 - 1997/98)

7.2   In addition, an analysis of tourism trends at specific landing sites is included in the
1997 report to the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom by Ron
Naveen, "Compendium of Antarctic Peninsula Visitor Sites." This report is the result
of the ongoing Antarctic Site Inventory Project. In addition, the Tourism Board of
Tierra del Fuego (In.Fue.Tur) publishes an annual report on "Antarctic Tourism
Numbers through the Port of Ushuaia."

7.3   With the exception of the Marco Polo, operating in the Antarctic since 1993,
traditional cruise liners have not regularly visited the Antarctic since the 1970s when
the Regina Prima, Cabo San Roque and Cabo San Vicente made a number of
voyages, each with more than 800 passengers. The Europa sailed to Antarctica in
1994-95 with 841 passengers and the Sagaford included a cruise-only visit to the
South Shetlands on an around the world voyage in 1992-93. The 1999-00 season
marks the first visit in a number of years by a larger cruise vessel, the Rotterdam, in
addition to the announced voyages aboard Aegean I and Ocean Explorer I, both
expected to carry more than 400 passengers.

7.4   Experienced Antarctic tour operators believe that operational realities and economic
considerations will discourage traditional cruise companies from including Antarctica
on their itineraries; Antarctica is too remote, across potentially stormy seas and of
limited interest to the mass market. While IAATO will monitor developments in the
tour industry, it is predicted that Antarctica will remain a specialized and expensive
niche destination offered by a limited number of experienced small ship tour operators
focusing on educational voyages to areas of exceptional natural history and
wilderness value.

8. IAATO Statement on Larger Cruise Vessels

8.1   As adopted in 1991, the IAATO Bylaws include a pledge by members not to carry
more than 400 passengers per trip. The 400-passenger limit was determined, in part,
by the fact that the seven founding members of IAATO included Paquet/Ocean cruise
Lines which operated the 400-passenger Ocean Princess at the time. The question of
larger vessels has been under active discussion by members since 1991 and the issue
remains high on the IAATO agenda. Orient Line, which has operated the Marco Polo
in the Antarctic since 1993-94, and is not currently a member of IAATO due the size
IAATO OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM ACTIVITIES PAGE 6

of the vessel, voluntarily limits the number of passengers carried to 500-600.

8.2  The July 1998 IAATO general Meeting voted by a 2/3 majority to remove the 
numerical limit of 400 passengers per voyage and replace it with a general statement 
on meeting the obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System. No appropriate language 
has been agreed upon and any further action on the 400-passenger limit is pending 
discussion at the 1999 IAATO general meeting in Hamburg (June 27 - July 1).

8.3  The significance of the size of the vessel as it relates to potential impact, contingency 
planning and emergency response is complex, and factors such as choice of landing 
site, number of landings, type of fuel carried may be of equal or greater importance 
than the size of the vessel. These are not issues that are easily resolved. In particular, 
IAATO members are concerned that potential cumulative environmental impacts and 
emergency response requirements of very large vessels could adversely impact on the 
principles of safe and environmentally responsible travel to Antarctica.

8.4  As a matter of principle and in practice, all tour operators - whether or not associated 
with IAATO - are included in emergency contact information, exchange of 
information and other activities of the IAATO Secretariat. Non-members, prospective 
members and other interested parties participate in the annual general meeting of 
IAATO, where obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System are discussed and policies 
developed.
