Information Paper submitted by SCAR to XXIII ATCM

Agenda Item 15

The SCAR Global Change Programme has developed linkages with other global change programmes of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Some programmes are jointly sponsored by SCAR with other organizations, leading to closer scientific collaboration. The attached diagram shows the relationships between the SCAR programme and other international programmes.

The acronyms used on the attached diagram are spelled out below.

The diagram shows the four research foci of GLOCHANT (left-hand column) and the cross
linkages between the nine programmes which constitute GLOCHANT. In some cases, these
programmes have originated within GLOCHANT and have then achieved affiliation with IGBP
or WCRP (eg ITASE). A second category includes IGBP or WCRP projects which have
subsequently been co-sponsored by SCAR (eg. Southern Ocean JGOFS).

Notes: 1. Relationships indicated by project names in square brackets are tentative or in development.
2. Linkage with WCRP is predominantly through the emerging Climate and Cryosphere (CLIC) activity.
3. The RiSCC proposed project on Antarctic terrestrial ecology and global change is being developed as
an activity of the SCAR WG Biology, and may include formal links with the IGBP GCTE project, and
with Arctic counterparts such as ITEX. RiSCC is a potential successor to the BIOTAS programme of WG
Biology.
4. The diagram does not include other global change activities within SCAR, such as projects under the
Working Group on the Physics and Chemistry of the Atmosphere (WG PACA), but close links are
maintained.
