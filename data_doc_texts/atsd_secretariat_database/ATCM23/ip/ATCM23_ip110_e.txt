held in Norway: 
 
NAV 44 
20 to 24 July 1998 
 
MEPC 42 
2 to 6 November 1998

2 The outcome of discussions at the seventy-first session of the Maritime Safety Committee, to be held from 19 to 
28 May 1999 will be presented orally during the twenty-third session of the ATCM meeting. 
 
outcome of M3~PC 42 
 
3 MEPC 42, having noted information provided by Norway on the discussion related to the Polar Code during the 
XXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in that country in May 1998, and due to the workload at that session, 
agreed to consider this matter further at MEPC43 in June/July 1999 and invited Member Governments to submit 
their comments to that meeting. 
 
outcome of MSC 7O 
 
4 At MSC 7O, the Committee noted the progress made and invited the MEPC to continue considering this issue. In 
this respect, the delegation of the United States, having expressed concern with regard to certain provisions of the 
draft Code which are in conflict with other treaties, advised MSC 70 of its intention to submit a relevant document 
to DE 43, addressing their concern. 
 
outcome of NAV 44 
 
S Having given preliminary consideration to the matter, and considering the heavy workload envisaged at NAV 45 
in September 1999, NAV 44, invited the MSC to postpone further consideration of this issue until NAV 46, 
sometime in the summer of 2OOO. MSC 70 had agreed to this request. 
outcome of FP 43 
 
6 Following a lengthy discussion on the various aspects of the proposed Code under its purview, FP 43 noted the 
concerns relating to the scope and application of the p~posed Code which several delegations felt was undear and, 
therefore, it would be difficult to conduct the requested review until this matter has been clarified by the DE 
Sub^Committee. observers representing the shipping industry also expressed concern regarding the necessity for 
such a Code and supported the comments made by Members with respect to the vague language contained in the 
scope and application of the draft Code. FP 43 agreed to invite the DE Sub-Committee to note the above comments 
and, in particular, to consider clarifying the scope and application of the draft Code with a view to approval by the 
Committee. In addition, Members were invited to submitcomments to FP 44 on the relevant parts of the draft Code 
identified by the Sub-Committee. 
 
outcome of SLF 42 
 
7 Having considered the parts of the Code under its purview, the outcome of which was reported to DE 43, SLF 42 
noted the concern of FP 43 regarding the scope and application of the Code and that the DE Sub-Committee was 
requested to clarify these issues. It was agreed that, after such clarifications were provided, there might be a need to 
give further consideration to the provisions of the draft Code falling under SLF Sub-Committee's purview. 
 
outcome of SIW 30 
 
8 Having considered the parts of the draft Code, as requested by DE 41, STW 3O recommended modifications to 
the draft Code. Having recognized that the Code was in an embryonic form and that it was therefore difficult to 
make definitive comments at this stage, STW 3O agreed that the relevant parts of the draft Code should be 
considered further when the DE Sub-Committee has sufficiently developed the draft Code. 
 
outcome of DE 42 
 
9 DE 42 noted the difficulties encountered by the FP and SLF Sub-Committees when discussing the relevant 
chapters of the proposed Code in the absence of a clearly defined scope and application of the Code to particular 
types and sizes of ships and, following detailed consideration, agreed to recommend the following framework for 
the development of the Code in order to assist the orderly consideration by the relevant sub-committees involved: 
 
.1 the Code should normally apply to SoLAS ships and include only those provisions that are additional to existing 
SoLAS requirements taking account of the climatic conditions of the polar regions; 
 
.2 should it be deemed necessary to also apply the Code to ships other than those to which SoLAS Convention 
applies, the particular types and sizes of ship to be covered by the Code should be decided by the Committee. For 
such ships the Code should identify which of the SoLAS requirements and any additional provisions could be 
relaxed or excluded; 
 
. . 
.3 the Code should take into account the fact that UNCLoS establishes the right of States with ice-covered areas to 
introduce legislation to cover navigation in such areas; 
 
.4 the Code should identify any survey and certification provisions which may be different to the corresponding 
SoLAS requirements; 
 
.5 any provisions additional to SoLAS requirements and the extension of the Code to also cover non-SoLAS ships 
should be fully considered and clearly justified. 
 
10 DE 42 invited the Committee to consider the scope and application of the Code, taking account of the above 
recommendations, and give guidance as to the future work of the sub-committees involved. 
 
outcome of BLG 4 
 
11 The Sub-Committee recalled that BLG 3, being advised that, according to the outline schedule prepared by DE 
41, the draft Code on polar navigation is expected to be finalized at DE 43 and, therefore, it should complete its 
work on the draft Code at BLG 4, after preliminary discussion of parts of the draft Code, which were identified by 
DE 41 as parts falling under the Sub-Committee's purview and are contained in the annex to document BLG 3/2/3, 
had invited Members to submit their comments on the aforementioned parts of the draft Code for consideration at 
this session with a view to finalization. 
 
12 The Sub-Committee noted information provided by the Secretariat (BLG4/11) on the outcome of consideration 
of this matter by MEPC 42, MSC 7O, NAV 45, FP 43, SLF 42, STW 3O and DE 42 and, in particular, noted that 
DE 42 (co-ordinator) recognized the difficulties encountered by the FP and SLF Sub-Committees when discussing 
the relevant chapters of the proposed Code in the absence of a clearly defined scope and application of the Code to 
particular types and sizes of ships and agreed to recommend the framework for the development of the Code as 
reflected in paragraph 9 above. 
 
13 Bearing the above in mind, the Sub-Committee discussed the matter in general and supported the above 
recommendations by DE 42 on the framework for the development of the draft Code considering that these 
recommendations should be extended to include reference to the MARPoL Convention . 
 
14 The Sub-Committee, having noted that the above recommendations of DE 42 as well as a relevant submission by 
the United States addressing their concern with regard to certain provisions of the draft Code which are in conflict 
with other treaties will be considered byMSC 71, agreed that it would be inappropriate at this stage to provide 
specific comments on the provisions of the Code and decided to consider the matter in detail at BLG 5 when the 
relevant guidance has been provided by MSC 71 and MEPC 43.
