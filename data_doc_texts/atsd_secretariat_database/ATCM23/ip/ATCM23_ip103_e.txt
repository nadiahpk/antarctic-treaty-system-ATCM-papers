Information Paper on the
COMNAP Home Page

1.    The COMNAP Home Page is being redeveloped to provide comprehensive information on 
the operation of COMNAP and details on all stations and bases in Antarctica. Stage 1 of the project 
is almost complete and it is planned to go public with the page by 30 June 1999. Under the 
password protected area of the page under "Operations" will be a full copy of the Antarctic 
Telecommunications Operators Handbook (ATOM) and MiniATOM which is a concise version 
which includes communications information on stations, ships of national operators, and tourist 
vessels

2.    Attached is a print out of the introductory pages.  Delegates are invited to examine the 
contents of the Home Page which can be viewed at  http://preview.comnap.aq   Each country is able to 
directly edit and update the information on their stations, etc. The Australian and Norwegian 
entries are the most complete at this stage although the page is being added to on a day by day 
basis.

3.    Comments and suggestions are most welcome and should be addressed to the COMNAP 
Secretariat.
