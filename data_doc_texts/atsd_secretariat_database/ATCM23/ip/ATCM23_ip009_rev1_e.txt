Title: Maintenance at Great Wall Station
Short Description of Activity:
In order to facilitate the transportation of food materials to Great Wall station, a
sandstone road will be built between the dock and the food-storehouse. The road is
about 80 meter long. Sand gotten from the bank of a lake nearby will be spread on the
pebble surface. The whole road is within the station area. Along the route from dock
to the food-storehouse there are no flora. So the new road have no effect on Antarctic
flora.

2) Pay attention to the wind direction and wind force when loading and unloading
sand, as well as paving the road in order to decrease the diffusion of dust.
3) Pay attention to the amount of the sand being taken away as well as the site, not to change the shape of the bank.
4) Select proper time to avoid the noise disturbing the animal nearby.

Title: Maintenance at Great Wall Station
Short Description of Activity:
According to the performance criterion of the building materials, the building at the Great Wall station needs removing rust and painting, especially the bottom of the buildings where has been seriously eroded by the wind. Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration will paint the building in 1998/1999 season.

Title: Inland Traverse to Dome A
Short Description of Activity:
From Dec 5,1998 to Feb 5,1999, Chinese Antarctica Inland Traverse team will carry out the investigation on ice-cover. The investigation team will set out from Zhongshan Station and travel along the route proceeding two inland investigation teams had taken last two years until to the point DT085, and will return at the point TD385. When the team go back it will follow the original way. The total length is about 1100km, in which about 600km is newly opened. During travel the team will perform investigation activities such as taking snow core sample, ice core sample and snow sample. The team consists of three vehicles and eight members who have rich field working and Antarctica investigation experiences. They can take immediate and proper actions on all kinds problems. During this investigation, except the ice-snow on the route that the motorcade will pass through may be intensified and contaminated by minute oil leakage, there are no other cumulative impacts. There are no flora and fauna living near the traveling route and investigated areas. The mechanical noise will have no impacts on the Antarctica ecological system.

Title: Modifications to Ongoing Hydrologic Data Collection in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica.

Short Description of Activity: Modifications to the on-going McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research project were proposed. The modifications would include placing temporary sampling wells in Taylor Valley stream channels and conducting a tracer experiment in Miers stream in the Miers Valley. Temporary sampling wells would be installed in the hyporheic zone at either Von Guerard Stream or Green Creek in the Fryxell Basin of Taylor Valley to collect water samples in January, before, during, and after a tracer experiment. The wells would be constructed of 2-inch polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and screened at specified depths collect water from that depth of the hyporheic zone. The wells will be installed in a line (transect) across the channel with 3-6 wells per transect. The will be 3-4 transects in the stream.

Type of Environmental Impact Assessment: Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE)

Planned Location of Activity: McMurdo Dry Valleys.

Organization Responsible for the EIA: The United States Antarctic Program

Decisions Following EIA: Proposal was approved and the research was conducted. The well casings were removed at the end of January1999.

Title: Amendment to Replacement of the Electric Power Plant and Fuel Storage Facilities at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica for Development of a New Taxiway.

Short Description of Activity: The power plant and fuel storage facilities at South Pole Station are currently being replaced under the USAP South Pole Safety and Environment project. It was determined that the work of building the new power plant will significantly interfere with aircraft operations on the present taxiway and may pose unacceptable safety risks to cargo crews who load and unload the planes. Therefore, it was proposed that a taxiway be prepared at a new location. The taxiway would also be sized and positioned to serve the new South Pole Station during and after its construction. Preparing a new taxiway involves grooming and compaction of the snow's surface using one Challenger 55 and one D-& model tractor, a land plane; a snow drag; and a roller.

Type of Environmental Impact Assessment: Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE)

Planned Location of Activity: Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station

Organization Responsible for the EIA: The United States Antarctic Program

Decisions Following EIA: Project was approved and new taxiway was constructed.
Title: Field Study to Determine the Stability of Land Surfaces in the Dry Valleys, Antarctica.

Short Description of Activity: Field studies were proposed to determine the soil stability and ground ice dynamics of land surfaces in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The primary location for the studies is the Beacon Valley. The proposed research would involve installing instrumentation to measure soil temperature, moisture, and displacement; collecting surface and subsurface samples; and obtaining permafrost cores. At each sampling site, activities would include installing instruments to continuously monitor soil temperature, humidity, and water flux in the soils, monitor the activity of contraction cracks, sampling the surface and subsurface rocks and sand from three shallow bore holes, and collecting frozen soil cores for isolation of ancient microbes. Sensors would remain at each site for two years. To mitigate disturbance to soils, tarps would be used to contain tailings during pit excavation and coring. All excavations would be backfilled, and the surface restored as near as possible to a pristine state. All field camp activities would be accomplished in accordance with the Dry Valleys Code of Conduct.

Type of Environmental Impact Assessment: Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE)

Planned Location of Activity: McMurdo Dry valleys, in particular the Beacon Valley

Organization Responsible for the EIA: The United States Antarctic Program

Decisions Following EIA: Proposal was approved and the research is being conducted.

Title: Vehicle Transport of Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) Gear on McMurdo Dry Valleys Ice and Snow Surfaces.

Short Description of Activity: A research project was proposed to use a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey for a single season to determine the internal composition of some selected, large morphologic features within the McMurdo Dry Valleys. It was proposed that control equipment would be transported using a vehicle, either light snowmobile or all terrain vehicle, to tow a small, light sled with the GPR-control equipment over ice or snow surfaces. Use of the vehicle off the ice or snow would be prohibited. Use of a motorized technique would greatly increase surveying efficiency and coverage of a larger area, which in turn would increase the scientific return on the project activities.

Type of Environmental Impact Assessment: Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE)

Planned Location of Activity: Lowermost Taylor Valley, Lowermost Wright Valley, West Central Wright Valley, and Central Mc Kelvey Valley

Organization Responsible for the EIA: The United States Antarctic Program

Title: Acquisition and Operation of the AFTAC Southern Network Antarctic Power System-Southern Network Antarctica Power System Upgrade (Mt. Newell and Lake Vanda).

Short Description of Activity: The proposed action is the construction and operation of replacement power systems for seismic stations at Lake Vanda and Mt. Newell. The power system at Lake Vanda would consist of two diesel-fueled generators, one solar array consisting of two banks of photovoltaic cells, and eight sealed lead-calcium batteries. Equipment at Mt. Newell would consist of one diesel-fueled generator, one solar array consisting of two banks of photovoltaic cells, one wind generator and thirty-six sealed lead calcium batteries. Prefabricated shelters would be installed to house the equipment and would rest on steel skids, with the overall structure anchored into bedrock. During operation the systems will provide energy from the source having adequate power to maintain a charge on the battery. To minimize risk of spills, generators and associated fuel tanks would be mounted over fuel containment pans, and fuel tanks double walled with leakage sensors in the inner wall to alarm the system controller in case of a leak

Type of Environmental Impact Assessment: Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE)

Planned Location of Activity: McMurdo Dry Valleys, specifically Mt. Newell and Lake Vanda

Organization Responsible for the EIA: The United States Air Force
