Schedule for Revised Management Plans of Antarctic Protected Areas 
in Accordance with Resolution 1 (1998) 
 
 
The United States is in the process of updating the management plans for those protected areas, currently still 
designated as Specially Protected Areas or Sites of Special Scientific Interest, for which it has principal 
responsibility. Listed below are those areas and the date when it is anticipated that a revised plan will be ready for 
consideration by the Treaty Parties. 
 
For some plans, necessary field work and preliminary drafts have been completed. For others, field work will need 
to be completed before a revised draft can be developed. One site, Cape Shirreff, is to be developed jointly with 
Chile. Another site, Arrival Heights, will require additional consultation with New Zealand before a preliminary 
draft will be ready for review by SCAR, the CEP, and CCAMLR, as appropriate. All dates for availability for 
ATCM consideration presume prior required review and incorporation of appropriate comments.
