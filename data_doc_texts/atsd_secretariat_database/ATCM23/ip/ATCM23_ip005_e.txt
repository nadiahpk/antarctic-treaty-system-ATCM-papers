In order to undertake a comprehensive review of the Contracting Parties' efforts to ensure 
compliance with the Protocol, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) has prepared 
the following checklist, which enumerates the items fundamental to the Protocol's 
implementation.  The checklist allows the user to identify a Party's efforts to comply with or 
enforce each of the Protocol's provisions.  Applying the same checklist to each Party will 
facilitate a uniform review. 
 
This checklist will be a useful tool for the Contracting Parties to evaluate their own records in 
implementing the Protocol and annexes, as well as for the Committee for Environmental 
Protection (CEP) to use in reviewing overall compliance with the Protocol’s provisions.  In this 
context, ASOC welcomes comments from any Party or the CEP that would improve the checklist 
and make it more useful to the Antarctic Treaty System.
