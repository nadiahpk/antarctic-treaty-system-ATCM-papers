SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES

A       Atmospheric Sciences

(I)     Ozone, trace gas and aerosol studies: National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Delhi,
        will continuc ground based UV-B radiation measurements which will be coupled with
        the measurements of IMD to understand the chemistry of ozone hole vis - a - vis
        radiation budget during the depletion period. In addition, investigations related to the
        aerosol contents and the katabatic wind flow over Schirmacher Oasis will be
        continued.

        The Laser Heterodyne System (LHS) will be operated during the austral summer to
        measure the vertical profile of ozone and other minor trace gases in the atmosphere
        upto a height of 60 km. Sun beam will be heterodyned with a laser beam to get a
        spectral intensity through a 1 GHz acoustic optic spectrometer. This data will be
        converted through retrieval technique to measure the profiles of ozone and water
        vapour in the atmosphere. These measurements, along with data from other sources
        will help to give insights to the intensity and dynamics of ozone hole phenomenon
        over Antarctica which is most pronounced after the polar night period.

(II)    Geomagnetic studies: This is an ongoing study to be continued by the Indian
        Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), Mumbai, and is aimed to understand the dynamics
        of mobile current systems in the Antarctic atmosphere. During the summer period,
        three fluxgate magnetometers and riometers will be operated simultaneously at three
        stations with the objective to obtain velocity of mobile auroral current systems that
        leave back geomagnetic pulsations. During the winter period, single station recording
        will be continued. This study will give insights to the following near and deep space
        processes:

        a)      Quiet time diurnal and seasonal changes in the geomagnetic field;

        b)      Geomagnetic field variations in response to ionospheric and magnetospheric field
                aligned currents;

        c)      HF radio communication in response to electromagnetic disturbances;

        d)      Harang Discontinuity feature of the auroral oval at Maitri.

(III)   Climatological and Meteorological studies: This is being pursued by India
        Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi, since the first expedition with the aim to
        built up a climatological data base of Antarctica. This information will be used as
        inputs to numerical weather prediction models for understanding the patterns of
        Antarctic circulation in context to global and Indian weather systems. A permanent
        and continuous observatory for recording and transmitting weather parameters,
        reception of satellite cloud imagery and weather chart broadcast already exists and
        will be operational during the XVIII Expedition. In addition, IMD will install a
        versatile Brewer Spectrophotometer which will be used to measure (a) the total ozone
concentration; (b) ground UVB radiation; (c) NO_(2) and SO_(2) concentrations and (d) 
vertical profile of O_(3) and NO_(2). The above data will be supplemented by periodic 
ozonesonde and radiometersonde ascents. Diffused radiation observations will be 
taken in addition to direct radiation observation.

(IV) VLF propagation studies: Barkatullah University, Bhopal will continue the ongoing 
experiment on VLF radiowave propagation studies for mapping of electric fields 
using whistlers on a continuous basis from Antarctica. These whistlers are a powerful 
tool for exploring the ionosphere and magnetosphere interactions emanating from the 
outer space. The whistlers are low frequency electro-magnetic waves generated by 
lightening discharge which enter through the plasma processes over the polar caps 
where the solar wind effect is most prominent. It will also provide data to experiments 
on long distance communication. The co-ordinated monitoring of VLF propagation 
has been recommended by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to 
be pursued by various countries in Antarctica as a part of an international campaign 
on solar terrestrial and astro-physical research.

B       Earth Sciences     

(I)     Geological mapping and Glaciological studies: As a part of the ongoing project, 
        Geological Survey of India (GSI), Faridabad, will carry out geological mapping of 
        about 1000 sq km in the area between 6 to 7 degree E in the Hoffman ranges of the 
        Orvin mountains. Samples will be collected from this area to study the crustal 
        evolution particularly with respect to the plutonic activity related to both the 
        Grenvillean and Pan-African events. Glaciological studies are aimed to decipher the 
        ice dynamics and history of the polar ice front movements and to prepare a geo-
        morphological glacial map of the area.

(II)    Snow drift and albedo studies : This is an ongoing study to be continued by Snow 
        and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Manali, for understanding the net 
        energy exchange budget between the atmosphere and the different types of snow-ice 
        surfaces in Antarctica. The albedo which is the most crucial factor in controlling the 
        energy balance, will be measured through a number of experiments under different 
        physical and atmospheric conditions. These studies are aimed to determine the 
        dependence of snow albedo on snow surface parameters like age of snow, grain size 
        and type of snow, cloud cover, solar elevation etc.

        The strong winds over the snow surface causes a shear, resulting into a snow drift 
        from the continent into the surrounding oceans. This plays a significant role in the 
        heat balance of Antarctica. The transport of snow under various conditions will be 
        enumerated in this study in order to understand the drift density profile under various 
        conditions like temperature, snow hardness, free water content and surface features.

(III)   Tele-seismic studies: Studies on seismic activity in Antarctica was initiated during 
        the last expedition by the scientists from the National Geophysical Research Institute
(NGRI), Hyderabad, during which a permanent digital broad band seismographic 
observatory was established. Continuos observations will be made with the following 
objectives :

a)    Monitor & study the frequency and strength of seismic activity in Antarctica;
b)    Record seismic shocks originating over the Indian Ocean region;
c)    Observations will be used in delincating the deep crustal structures of the carth.

(IV)  Planetary geodetic studies: A permanent GPS Observatory has been established by 
NGRI in Schirmacher Oasis under the SCAR GPS Epoch campaign for carrying out 
high precision geodetic measurements in Antarctica. A Turbo Rogue GPS receiver 
has been installed by NGRI as a part of the international GIANT project (Geodetic 
Infrastructure in Antarctica). The scientific goals of this project are as follows:

a)    to provide accurate positions in the global reference frame, as also a fundamental 
       frame for (relative) positioning-in the operation area of cach Antarctic expedition;
b)    to study tectonic movements of the Antarctic plate in relation to other plates;
c)    to link sea level changes with vertical motions of plates.

(V)   Topographical Mapping: The Survey of India (SOI), Dehradun, will carry out a 
      detail survey on scale 1:1000 with contour interval of 1 m for the proposed summer 
      camp site in Maitri region. It will also provide precise ground control points for 
      geological and geophysical field work. In addition, SOI will also assist GSI in the 
      study of glacial dynamics by providing geodetic survey aids.

(VI)  Hydrographic Survey: The Naval Hydrographic Office (NHO), Dehradun. will 
      carry out hydrographic survey in the approach waters of the India bay in Antarctica 
      towards preparing a nautical chart of the area. Bathymetric and physical 
      oceanographic data will be collected for the above purposes through a systematic 
      survey.

C     Biological and Environmental Sciences

(1)   Bio-diversity of diatoms: As a part of studies on bio-diversity of Antarctica. 
      Botanical Survey of India (BSI), Calcutta, will carry out a morpho-taxonomical 
      survey of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) in the Schirmacher Oasis in order to address 
      the following:

a)    Morpho-taxonomy and floristics;
b)    Phytogeographical affinities vis-a-vis Indian occurrences;
c)    Development of an 'Environmental Specimen Bank' using diatoms as signature 
      species;
d)    Diversity of diatoms employing detailed nomenclature, taxonomic account. 
      phenology. ecology and phyto-geography.
(II) Bio-diversity of Nematodes in association with moss inhabiting fauna : As a part 
of the ongoing studies on bio-diversity of Antarctica, Zoological Survey of India 
(ZSI). Calcutta. will carry studies on nematodes inhabiting terrestrial moss in the 
Schirmacher Oasis. This project while addressing the morpho-taxonomy of the above 
invertebrate will also help to generate the bio-geographical relationship in terms of 
different eco systems. It will also help to indicate any phyto-geographical affinities 
with respect to Himalayan assemblage.

(III) Biodiversity of Anacrobes around Maitri: The Industrial Toxicology Research 
Centre (ITRC). Lucknow. will undertake a new programme on the bio-diversity of 
anaerobic microbial flora in Schirmacher Oasis. As the anaerobic bacterial 
community of Antarctica is very little explored. this study will be conducted with the 
following objectives:

a) Quantitative and qualitative estimation of anaerobes around Maitri
b) Identification of anaerobes using phenotypic methods. DNA based and RNA based 
typing methods. protein analysis and chemataxonomic markers
c) Physiological grouping of anaerobes and its application in beneficial processes.

The above three experiments on bio-diversity will contribute to the international 
SCAR campaign on Biology of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems [BIOTAS].

(IV) Eutrophication analysis of Antarctic Lakes: With the Environmental Protocol on 
Antarctica coming into force. it would be necessary to continuously monitor the 
health of the fresh water lakes in the Schirmacher oasis region. To this end. the Dept 
of Civil Engineering. University of Roorkee will initiate a new experiment on the 
Eutrophication analysis of the Antarctic lakes in order to develop a nomogram on lake 
characteristics. The trophic status of lakes will be assessed by analysing water quality 
parameters such as total phosphorous. chlorophyll. and Secci depths. In addition. 
other physical and chemical parameters of the lake water at periodic intervals will be 
measured to develop a time series and multi variate analysis. These will be used to 
catalogue the Total Phosphorous Trophic State Index (TPTSI) which is a potent 
indicator of the trophic status of the lakes.

(V) Ambient sea noise processes in relation to marine mammals in Antarctic waters: 
The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). Goa, will carry out a theoretical and 
experimental study to understand the interaction of random scatters of arbitrary shape 
and size of marine life. To this end. the acoustic ambient noise in the latitudes 60 to 
70 degree S will be mapped using CTD/XBT and will be related to physical origin at 
select locations around the Antarctic polynya. The aim of the experiment will be to 
construct the under water acoustic ray propagation in order to correlate it with the 
ambient acoustic environment and animal behavior.
1)      Medical Sciences  

(1)   Thermoregulatory effects of tropical subjects with reference to special polar 
clothing: This is a new study to be undertaken by Defence Institute of Physiology and 
Allied Sciences (DIPAS). Delhi, to assess the thermoregulatory effect on human 
subjects with reference to special clothings taking into consideration the climatic 
variables and cooling power indices. This will be used to predict required clothing 
insulation with respect to biomedical indices while working in Antarctic conditions 
with the view to provide maximum comfort. The proposed study will be helpful to 
reduce physiological problems and to ensure homeostasis through use of proper 
clothing.

(II)  Stress response and its effect on social behaviour: All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, will conduct a study on significant stress factors and its 
impact on human relationship and social behaviour. The interactive styles within the 
team members will be analysed in order to correlate the dynamics of interpersonal 
disharmony. The ultimate aim of this study would be to refine the screening procedure 
and modify the training imparted to the team members if found necessary.

(I)   Structural engineering and fuel cell studies: Research and Development Engineering 
Establishment (R&DE). Pune. will continue the studies on condition monitoring of the 
structural components of the station under low temperature conditions. A novel aspect 
of these studies includes an on-line health monitoring of various infrastructural 
facilities through computer networking. Experiments on performance levels of 
Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) will be conducted as an alternate 
source of non conventional energy. Efforts will be made to design 500 W. 12V fuel 
cell power source along with Metal Hydrogen Storage systems for use in Antarctica 
and cold climate conditions.

(II)  Communication technology: The Defence Electronics & Application Laboratory 
(DEAL). Dehradun. will be responsible for the maintenance and upgradation of the 
communication linkages from Maitri. This includes Maitri to India communication. 
Maitri to convoy communication and convoy to convoy communication using various 
modes. In addition. DEAL will carry out the following experiments:
