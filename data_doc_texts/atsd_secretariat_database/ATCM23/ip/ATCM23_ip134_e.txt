opening Address by Minister Plenipotentiary-Expert 
Dr. Emmanue1 Gounaris, Head of the Delegation of Greece 
 
Mr. Chairman, 
 
on behalf of the Greek Delegation, I would like to congratulate you on your election as 
Chairman of the XXIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. May I also through you Mr. 
Chairman, express my gratitude to the Government of Peru for hosting this meeting in the 
historic and beautiful city of Lima and also my thanks for its warm hospitality. 
 
Mr. Chairman, Greece believes that it is in the interest of all nations to preserve Antarctica 
and its waters, for peaceful purposes only and to guard against their becoming the scene of 
object of international discord. 
 
Mr. Chairman, one of the most important questions of our Meetings is the establishment of 
a Secretariat to assist the work of the Antarctic Treaty System. All of us, need this 
Secretariat, especially the Non-Consultative Parties We hope during this Meeting this 
matter will be solved in a satisfactory manner. 
 
Mr. Chairman, Greece is also particularly concerned about the ozone layer over Antarctica 
and support in this matter, any action and suggestion of SCAR and the non-governmental 
organisations ECo and ASoC, necessary to ensure the earliest possible recovery of the 
ozone layer. 
 
During the current session of the ATCM, proposals relating to Liability Annex will be 
further discussed. I am confident that the deliberations would yield a solution which would 
ensure a balance between the competing needs of science and environment. 
 
Finally Mr. Chairman I would like to inform this meeting, that Greece, in particular the 
National Centre for Marine Research, in collaboration with other Greek Institutions, has 
already established the National Program for Antarctica. 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman
