NAMING OF THE “MAX DOUGUET” ARCHIPELAGO  
ON THE ADELIE COAST 
 
 
France wishes to inform all other Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties that the archipelago located 
off the Adelie Coast, consisting of the islands located off the Port Martin Peninsula, including Seal 
Island, Penguin Island, Bizeux Rock, Survivor Island, Breton Islet, Emperor Island and Marguerite 
Island, has been named the “Max Douguet” Archipelago by a decision dated 29 October 1998. 
 
On 26 November 1948, then Commander (later Admiral) Max Douguet sailed from Brest on the 
bridge of polar vessel Commandant Charcot; his primary mission was to land and settle on the 
Adelie Coast the eleven-member French Antarctic Expedition led by André Liotard, as well as to 
reassert French sovereignty on this Territory which had been discovered in 1840 by the French 
explorer Captain Dumont-d'Urville. 
 
During this first voyage of 1948–49, a thick ice cover and extensive pack ice along the Adelie Coast 
prevented members of the expedition from landing; instead, they carried out scientific observations 
and explored the Balleny Islands at the mouth of the Ross Sea. 
 
Thereafter, Admiral Max Douguet settled the first two French polar expeditions intending to winter 
on the Adelie Coast.  On 3 February 1950, members of the Liotard expedition landed and prepared 
to winter in Antarctica.  Upon his third voyage to the Adelie Coast, Max Douguet landed the 
expedition led by Lieutenant Michel Barré to relieve the the Liotard expedition. 
 
The French Government has decided to name the archipelago after Admiral Max Douguet to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the start of his first mission to the Adelie Coast on 
26 November 1948 and to pay tribute to this illustrious man who passed away on 18 August 1989. 
 
The new toponym applies to the entire group of islands located off the former Port Martin Base 
where the first expeditions wintered in Antarctica; it has now become official and as such may 
appear on all cartographic documents of the French Antarctic and Austral Territories. 
 
A map of the archipelago is attached to this document.
