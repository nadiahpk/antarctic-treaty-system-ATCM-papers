BACKGROUND 
 
1. 
Following the discussions at ATCM XXII on the “Safety of Operations in the Antarctic” 
(Final Report ATCM XXII, para 93), COMNAP was requested to “compile information on current 
standards of shipping in Antarctica, making use of existing sources of information where possible, 
and if feasible stating the categories of ships concerned”. 
 
2. 
The attached table lists the vessels used by national Antarctic operators during the 1998/99 
season giving the country of registration, name, ice class, year of build, type and purpose, length, 
beam and displacement.  The distribution of vessel size (with respect to overall length) is given in 
the table below.
