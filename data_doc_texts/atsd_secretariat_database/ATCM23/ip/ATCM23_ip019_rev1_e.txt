THREE ISLANDS RENAMED 
IN THE POINTE-GEOLOGIE ARCHIPELAGO ON THE ADELIE COAST: 
LE MAUGUEN ISLAND, FIORESE ISLAND AND LATTANZI ISLAND

France wishes to inform other Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty that those 
islands in the Pointe-Géologie Archipelago on the Adelie Coast previously called Alexis-
Carrel Island (by 140° 00.6' E and 66° 40.2' S), Le Taureau Island (by 139° 58.9' E and 66° 
39.5' S) and Damiers Island (by 139° 58,0' E and 66° 39,24' S) have been renamed Le 
Mauguen Island, Fiorese Island and Lattanzi Island respectively.

This decision aims to pay tribute to the memory of three individuals who died in the 
line of duty on February 8, 1999 in a helicopter accident on the Adelie Coast : Pascal Le 
Mauguen, a technician working for the Institut français pour la recherche et la technologie 
polairc (IFRTP) (French Institute for Polar Research and Technology); Bruno Fiorese, a 
helicopter pilot; and Dario Lattanzi, a mechanical engineer on the vessel L'Astrolabe.

A map of the Pointe-Géologie Archipelago showing these islands with their new 
names is attached to this information paper.
