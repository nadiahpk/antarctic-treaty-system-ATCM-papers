INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION

COMPACTED SNOW RUNWAY AT THE LARSEMANN HILLS

1. INTRODUCTION

Aviation is a very important component of Antarctic logistics. Every austral summer many
national antarctic programs send their expeditioners to the southern gateways at South America,
Africa, Australia and New Zealand. But just a few national programs have entry points for aircraft
in Antarctica. Argentina, Chile and United Kingdom fly to Antarctica from South America. United
States, New Zealand and Italy send personnel to Antarctica from New Zealand. None national
programs can fly to Antarctica from Africa or Australia because there is no entry point in the East
Antarctica.

A concept of the East Antarctica Air Network (EAAN) was presented at the VI SCALOP
Symposium in Rome (Klokov & Lukin,1995). The EAAN idea met interest from several national
antarctic programs including Australia, China, France and Japan. The key component of EAAN is
the establishment of a hard-surface runway in the East Antarctica which would be used for inter-
continental flights. As previous practice showed, compacted snow runways can be developed and
successfully used by conventional aircraft at very low cost and with minimal environmental
disturbance.

2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1. Antarctic Treaty legislation

During last decade Antarctic aviation has been getting more international constitution than
ever before. National Antarctic programs are making practical steps to improve efficiency and
safety of air operations. A logical extension of this trend of international collaboration would be
establishment a well-distributed network of hard-surface runway in Antarctica. In particularly, such
joint-use air network would be gainful and productive in East Antarctica where many countries are
operating.

The idea of establishment a cooperative air network appeared in 1972 when the VII-th
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting adopted Recommendation VIII-8 "Cooperation in transport"
In 1975 the VIIIth ATCM sustained the momentum for a cooperative air transport system by
adopting Recommendation VIII-7 "Cooperation in transport" (Appendix 1). Both of the
recommendations are aimed at improvement in logistic capability of Antarctic operators by using a
joint transport facilities. They encourage bilateral or multilateral consultations between
Contracting Parties in order to establish such joint transport facilities when it would be practicable
and mutually convenient. However, so far there is but one practical implementation of the ATCM
recommendations. It is the integration of the New Zealand, Italian and US air operations between
Christchurch and McMurdo.
2.2. Purpose and need of the inter-continental flights to the East Antarctica

It looks obvious that an inter-continental airlinks connecting Africa and Australia with 
Antarctica would provide numerous benefits for national research programs as well as for 
environment protection. Main progressions of hard-surface snow runway construction in the East 
Antarctica could be formulated as followings:
- improvement of all human safety aspects;
- reducing of total environmental impact produced by existing transport system;
- earlier beginning of season operations at the continent and extending of their total 
duration;
- maximizing of research productivity by facilitating personnel exchange and reducing 
travel time to Antarctica;
- posibility for senior scientists to attend antarctic projects and greatly enhance the quality 
of national research program.

2.3. Advantages of the Larsemann Hills as a middlesite entry point for the transcontinental 
airlink Africa-Antarctic-Australia

The Larsemann Hills  is one of biggest rock outcrops in the Prydz Bay coastal area (East 
Antarctica). Operating very close one to other, National programs of Australia, China and Russia 
have concentrated a substantial parts of their support infrastructure and logistic activity  in the 
Prydz Bay area. After Progress Station reopening in 1998 in the Larsemann Hills, three permanent 
stations: Davis (Australia), Zhong Shan (China), Progress (Russia) are operating year around in 
proximity of 100 km.  Besides, a several seasonal base exist nearby, in the Prince Charles 
Mountains and on coastal rocks of Prydz Bay. Annually hundreds of expeditioners are coming in 
the area and back using sea transport. But none of these National Programs has direct access to the 
area by intercontinental flights.

Furthermore, runway in the Larsemann Hills could be used by many other countries if an intra-
continental airlink would be introducted in the East Antarctica. The Larsemann Hills lies roughly in 
the midway between two potential gateways in outer continents: Cape Town (5278 km) and 
Hobart (4947 km) as shown in Figure 1 (Klokov,1998). Therefore, a runway located in the 
Larsemann Hills could be a convenient entry point for transcontinental airlink Africa-Antarctic-
Australia. Consequently a runway existence in the Larsemann Hills would also facilitate logistic 
operations for a few European and Asian countries including France, Italy and Japan.

2.4 RAE experience in compacted snow runway constaction and inter-continental airlink 
maintenance

The Russian Antarctic Expedition has recently operated aircraft between Africa and Antarctica. 
Two entry airfields near Molodezhnaya and near Novolazarevskaya stations have been constructed 
and maintained during 80-s and early 90-s (Figure 1).

The Molodezhnaya airfield was built in 1981 at 10 km eastward the station near Vechernyaya 
Mountain. The runway was performed as hard-surface compacted snow pavement laying over deep 
natural snow. Runway had dimensions of 2540 x 42 m and heading 140/320  . Airfield 
infrastructure included: 4 living houses, powerstation, hangar, storehouse, repair shop, refueling 
mobile units and radio/nav aids. The Molodezhnaya runway has been prepared for air operation by 
November 1992.

The Novolasarevskaya airfield has been used as an alternative to Molodezhnaya. The runway

Fig. 1 . Distance in kilometres from entry points in Australia and Africa to 
the runway site in the Larsemann Hills
has been located at 15 km south of the station on a blue ice field. The upper point of runway was of
550 m above sea level. The runway was performed as blue-icestrip protected by thin compacted
snow cover. Runway had dimensions of 2760 x 60 m and operating heading 106°. Airfield
infrastructure includes: 2 living houses, powerstation, store/repair shop, refueling mobile unit and
radio/nav aids. The Novolazarevskaya runway has been prepared for air operation by November
1994.

Since 1981 until 1992 regular intercontinental flights to Molodezhnay and Novolazarevskaya
have been performed from Maputo (Mozambican) and Cape Town (South Africa). Basically, two
aircraft, an Ilyushin Il-76TD and an Ilyushin-18D, operated from October to February. Both of those
are conventional wheeled aircraft.

Ilyushin Il-76 is one of most effective aircraft for long range air operation (Table 1). Il-76
aircraft is equipped with airborne winches, electrical telfers, trestle and lifted ramp. This airborne
equipment allows handling any cargo operations on unequipped airfields. For Antarctic flights the
aircraft has been modifited for transportation of both passenger and cargo on the same plane. The
aircraft can carry on up to 50 passengers and 15 tons of cargo. In August 1991, the last emergency
flight from Molodezhnaya to Cape Town Ilyushin - 76 TD had gotten 135 passengers on board.
An Ilyushin-18D has been used as air-borne laboratory for various scientific programs.

3. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS AND MAIN TYPES OF ACTIVITY

3.1. General

Three main components of the project should be considered. They are the snow runway, an
access route and a field camp with associated facilities. Their location and general characteristics
have defined below.

The proposed construction intensity and maintenance procedure are outlined because they are
most substantial types of ground activity. Typical scenarios of air operations, implying their timing
and amount, are generalized below.

3.2. Location of the snow runway

Proposed runway site is located outside of rock exposures but on of snow covered extreme of
the Antarctic icesheet south of the Larsemann Hills (Fig. 2). There is a relatively flat promontory of
the ice plato laying in 2 km southward of ultimate rock outcrops of the Larsemann Hills. In 1984-
86, this site had been used as airstrip for handling of Ilyushin-14, a small ski-equiped aircraft.

The snow surface relief on the runway site is reasonably level and surface gradients is
appropriate to airfield standards. The runway approaches were examined and assessed as adequate
to aviation standards. There are no upwind mountains or any other obstacles on both take-off and
landing paths in the area.

The data on the runway major characteristics are given in Table 2. The 223750 m^(2) of natural 
snow covering the ice sheet would be affected by runway construction.

                      Table 2. Data summary of the proposed snow runway

3.4. Access route

The runway site lies at about 5 km south of the Progress Station, at 6 km south of the Zhong 
Shan Station and at 4.5 km south of the Low Base. The runway site can be easy accessed by ground 
transport. A safe route, 10 km long, have been put through between runway and Progress station 
(Figure 2).

The vehicular traffic along the access route should take place by snow during wintertime before 
the snow melting starts, that is from March to November. The fuel to airfield main tank will be 
transported during winter only. In October-November the fuel will be delivered from the fuel 
storage directly to the aircraft by sledge. In February- March the aircraft will be refueled from the 
airfield main fuel tank. From December to March the traffic intensity along the access route will be 
at a minimum, to serve the two planned flights only controller personnel and passengers will be 
delivered.

3.5. Assosiated facilities

A temporary field camp (summer camp) for runway construction and maintenance will be 
established on ultimate rock outcrops of the Larsemann Hills 2 km northward of the runway site 
(Figure 2). The camp will be comprise three houses: accommodation house, powerhouse combined 
with workshop, radio/nav aids house.

The accommodation house will be single storey and constructed of timber panels with foam 
core. It will be supported by small concrete slabs founded on the rocks. It will accommodate 4 
people during the austral summer. The power house will be fabricated as a container divided at two 
blocks :a diesel generator block and workshop block. The container will be supported on a sledge. 
The radio/nav aids house also will be constructed as a container set up on a sledge. The total area 
which is to be disturbed by the field camp will be approximately 400 m^(2).

3.6. Construction and maintenance requirments for the compacted snow runway

Using the term of hard-surface runway, we mean a runway that is capable to receive a heavy 
wheeled aircraft. Establishing of a hard-surface runway on deep snow seems to be a difficult task
5

taking into consideration that a strong pavement has to be created over a thick and weak snow/firm basement. However, a fairly simple procedure has been developed by Russian engineers in 80’s. 
The first compacted snow runway was built at the Molodezhnaya Station (Klokov, 1995).

Compacted snow runway designing for wheeled aircraft has to be hard enough to resist wheel ruts formed by the aircraft and strong enough to support the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft. The major input parameters to design an adequate pavement for a snow / ice runway are the aircraft wheel tire pressure and the maximum take-off weight. A pavement of adequate thickness and strength has to be designed using the specifications of the particular aircraft to be used. The value of the required thickness and strength for heavy wheeled aircraft are given in Table 3.

Table 3. Required parameters of snow pavements for heavy wheeled aircraft use in Antarctica

| Aircraft | Max. T-O gross weight, ( kg ) | Tire pressure, (kg/cm ^{2} ) | Pavement thickness, ( m ) | Upper layer hardness, ( MPa ) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-130H | 79400 | 7 | 0.5 | 0.8 |
| Ilyushin Il-76TD | 210000 | 5-7 | 0.7 | 0.8 |

Construction procedure that will be used at the runway should include three main methods of snow processing:
· disaggregating the snow with disk harrows,
· leveling with a grader
· and compacting with a multiple-tire roller.

The maintenance procedure includes the same methods of snow processing, although it is less labour-intensive. Required machinery for compacted snow runway construction/maintenance at the Larsemann Hills are listed in Table 4.

3. 7. Timing of the activity

3.7.1. Construction period. The runway construction work will take place during 1999-2001. The 
airfield camp will be constructed in 2000 and occupied 6 month during construction period until 
2001.

3.7.2.Planned air operations

The planned number of flights to the runway in th Larsemann Hills amounts to:

• 3 flights in October-November
• 2 flights in February-March

3.7.3. Runway maintenance procedure. Maintenance activity the snow runway will be repeted 
each austral summer since 2002 according to operational requirments. Since 2002 the field camp 
will be in use intermittently during austral summer.

3. 8. Air operations and aircraft handling

3.8.1. Type of aircraft. A heavy wheeled aircraft Ilyushin - 76TD and similar types are planned to 
be used in transport operation (see Table 1 for characteristics).

3.8.2. Flight routes over the Larsemann Hills.General sketch of approach path and take-off path 
is present on the Figure 3.

3.8.3. Aircraft refueling. Aviation fuel will be stored at the existing fuel storage of Progress station 
on the seashore. 100 tons of bulk aviation kerosene is to be annually delivered to the storage. The 
fuel transportation is planned to be done from Australia (or Africa) by sea. 50 tons of kerosene is to 
be delivered to the airfield main tank to refuel the February -March flights. The fuel for the 
October-November flights will be delivered directly from the shore storage. The fuel to be required 
for each flight amounts to 20 tons. The refueling operation should be done in the specially adapted 
place.

4. CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES

4.1. No-action alternative

Main advantages of this project for national programs operating in the East Antarctica have 
been formulated above. Introducing of a trans-continental airlink Africa-Antarctica-Australia in 
conjunction with internal air network will improve safety, reduce environmental impact and 
facilitate national research programs.

The no-action alternative for this project would represent a missed opportunity to improve both 
existing transport and safety systems in the East Antarctica.  Also, a currently present serious press 
on environment will proceed because numbered vessel voyages will keep on in the area to rotate 
expeditioners and scientific equipment.  Since intercontinental airlink is developed marine 
operations will be reduced or even carried out once in two years.

4.2. Alternative methods

4.2.1. Ground runway on rock outcrop. There are a several sites in the Prydz Bay area where a 
gravel runway could be constructed. However, the sites on rock outcrops existed near stations have 
extremely rough surface and comprise usually a dissected rock ridges.

Therefore, a great deal of construction work should be undertaken and a significant investment

should be required to construct and maintain a gravel runway at any of these sites. Beside, the sites
environment would be rigidly damaged and ecosystems would be destroyed. So this alternative was
considered as unacceptable and was dismissed.

4.2.2. Runway on sea ice. From a common point of view sea ice is an attractive platform for a
runway which is settig up to handle wheeled aircraft. Two main criteria such as thickness of sea ice
and depth of snow covering the ice are to be considered to determine the suitability of a sea ice spot
for runway construction. Sea ice has to be thick enough to bear aircraft load and snow cover has to
be reasonably thin to strip it off. Otherwise, a great deal of snow plowing will be needed to remove
snow from the runway.

In the East Antarctica most of coastal stations are established in areas where sea ice breaks
every summer season. Such environment pattern fits well to the traditional marine transport system.
On the other hand, there is no site at reasonable proximity to existing coastal stations where is an
year-old sea ice plate that would be thick enough to bear heavy wheeled aircraft.

The possibility of having a sea ice plate thickened by flooding with sea water has been
examined in the vicinity Syowa Station in 1980 and near Molodezhnaya Station in 1985-88
(Nakawo, 1982). The field experiments demonstrate that an artificial ice platform with thickness of
up to 3 m could be built-up by flooding. However, in many respects, it is not a simple task to
construct and maintain a runway on sea ice. Special techniques and methods are needed to prepare
the runway. A significant amount of machinery must be provided for construction, such as
bulldozers, snow-blowers, powerful water pumps and so forth. Also, a runway constructed on sea
ice would be broken up or completely destroyed by a natural forces at any unpredictable moment.
From this point of view, a runway built on sea ice should not be considered as a long-term
installation.

5. DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING ENVIRONMENT / BASELINE INFORMATION

Since certain factors asso[?]iated with th eplanned activity will affect not only the glacier
ecosystem in the immediate vicinities of the runway, but also some ecosystem componenmts of the
adjoning terrestrial area, we present here breif characteristics of the existing environment of the
mainland part of the Larsemann Hills.

5.1. Environment composition and general features

Larsemann Hills presents a series of islands and  peninsula outcropping from  the Antarctic
shield between 76 and 77 degree East. They extend to 8 km along the Ingrid Christensen Coast in
the Prydz Bay and are 85 km west of Davis station An area of hills including islands makes up
about 50 sq. km. The hills surface is much dissected with maximum heights of about 150m above
sea level (Figure 3). Along with slopes of 45 degree and more and vertical crevice sides there are
relatively vast plain surfaces in the hills. These surfaces are connected with marine transgression
and are mostly of heights close to 50–60 m and 10m. Also some surfaces of low slope angles (less
than 5 degree) owe their origin to the glacier exaration activity. Horizontal surfaces resulted from
original rock occurrence are practically lacking. Canyon-shaped topographic forms tied up with
tectonic fractures are located in the hills area.

Soft deposits are presented mostly by eluvium and colluvium. The thickness of soft deposits is
insignificant, that is up to the first meters. The major part of the territory is an original rock outcrop,
practically without soft deposits. To the north of Mirror peninsula as well as in the numerous small
bays there are beach deposits, elevating in some places up to 10 meters above sea level. At different
orographic levels morainic material occurs.

Due to relief peculiariaty, low thickness of soft deposits and poor drainage of frosted rock  more
than one hundred of all sized lakes  can be found at the small hills area (Gillieson et al., 1990). The
biggest lakes situated in the area of possible impact are as follows: Progress lake (watershed area
39,1 hectares, lake table area 10,5 hectares, max depth 34 m), Mîr lake (watershed area 82 hectares,
lake table area 12,5 hectares, max depth 0,7 m), Stepped lake (watershed area 57,8 hectares, lake
table area 5,0 hectares, max depth 4,5 m). Under extreme conditions Nell lake (watershed area 259.0
hectares, lake table area 13.0 hectares, max depth 8,2 m) could fall within an impacted area through
Progress lake and nameless small lake system.

There are no big rivers on the hills territory. Short watercourses function within a period of
active snow melting only. There are three relatively big streams : the first one flows into Stepped
lake and runs out of it; the second runs out of nameless lake No 73 (according to Gillieson et al.,
1990) and flows into Mîr lake; and the third flows into Progress lake. Some of these watercourses
cross the road.

5.2. Glaciology of the runway site

There is a gradual slope of the ice sheet inland of Larsemann Hills, mostly covered with snow
year-round. It appears that the ice at the area tends to drift toward the Dalk Glacier valley and this
results in hard crevassing  eastward of the hills. Proposed runway site is located on a relatively flat
promontory of the icesheet stretching up to south of the Larsemann Hills.

In February 1996 five cores up to 180 cm depth were taken on the runway site. We found that
two types of structures exist along the runway. One type demonstrates a glaciological condition
when all accumulated snow is transformed into ice within one year. This type is drawn from NE
end of runway until 0.3 km point. On February 5 the thickness of this rough firn/snow ranged from
5cm to 20 cm. Obviously these last remains of the winter snow will either melted or blown away by
strong winds before the next snow accumulation.

The second type of structure found in the upper layers appears over the rest of the runway and
can be characterized as multiple annual melt zones alternating with firn snow. Analyses of the cores
taken in this part of the runway allows us to assume that annual snow accumulation here varies in
the range 30–40 cm. The ratio between volume of ice lenses and annual snow accumulation is about
30 %. Rather thick layers of the rough disaggregated firn were revealed at depths ranging from 90
cm to 110 cm. Usually their occurance is associated with melt water infiltration, so their depth can
be interpreted as depth of annual melt penetration (Klokov,1998-a).

In 1997/98 summer season snow stratigraphy on the runway site was investigated in three
snow pits. Multiple firn layers alternating with annual zones of melt ice layers were revealed
(Klokov, 1998b). Basing on stratigraphical data, we assume that the snow accumulation rate at the
runway site varied in the range of 40 -70 cm (Figure 4).

5.3. Meteorology

Surface meteorological data at Zhongshan Station (69°22’ and 76°22’), published by Chinese
Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CHINARE Data Report No.7, 1994), have been used to
illustrate the general features of the meteorological regime in the Larsemann Hills area. Only data
from October to March were analyzed because all major air operations are conducted during this
period and it is a suitable time for snow/ice runway construction and maintenance.

Temperature has a dominant influence on snow/ice runway construction and maintenance procedures. The practice of compacted-snow runway construction in Molodezhnaya shows that effective compression would be achived when snow temperature is in the range -5° - 0°C (Klokov, V. 1979). On the other hand, gross melting can result in disaggregation of the compacted snow or even form melt pools on an ice runway. Therefore, historical temperature records have been examined to determine month means, means of daily maximum, and observed maximum of air temperature. These data are shown in Table 5.

Table 5. Climatological summaries of air temperature (°C), wind direction and wind speed (m/s) at the Larsemann Hills as observed at Zhongshan Station (69°22' and 76°22').

|                 Means 1989-1992 | October | November | December | January | February | March |

| prevalent wind direction        | E (90°) | E (90°)  | E (90°)  | E (90°) | E (90°)  | E(90°)|

| max wind gust, m/s               | 31.9    | 29.1     | 31.8     | 27.2    | 26.0     | 30.3  |

The wind regime is also one of the most important factors for both runway construction and aviation operations. A knowledge of the strong wind direction ranges is needed to align the runway along the strongest wind direction or as close as possible to it. Data collected at Zhong Shan meteostation are shown in Table 5. The east winds of high repeatability prevail in the area. From October to March, maximum wind gust recorded at the meteostation was less than 32 m/s.

On the ice-cap plateau wind directions are very much affected by mesoscale fluctuations of local topography. Therefore wind observations will be required at the runway site to adjust to the wind observation database available at the station. Here we present some data available for the Progress-1 and Progress-2 Stations.

An analysis of 1988 meteorological data at the Progress-1 station and of occasional observations in the region of the proposed airfield, as well as 1989 meteorological data at the Progress-2 station and the 1998 meteorological data at the Zhong Shan station provided general picture of the temperature and wind regimes of some part of Broknes Peninsula.

Brief summary of the meteorological data of two stations during the period 1988-1989. The easterly winds were predominant comprising around 50% both during a year and in all months with insignificant deviations. The mean wind speeds were about 7 m/s. The strong winds were rare with the number of days with winds speeds greater than 15 m/s comprising less than 20%. In the summer, the night wind becomes more intense.
Table 6a. Meteorological data (air temperature (°C), wind direction and wind speed (m/s)) at the 
 Larsemann Hills as observed at Progress-1 Station (69°22' and 76°22').

| 1988 | October | November | December | January | February | March |
| Min T | -19.4 | -15,1 | -8,4 | -6,7 | -12,1 | -16,1 |

Table 6b. Meteorological data (air temperature (°C), wind direction and wind speed (m/s)) at the 
 Larsemann Hills as observed at Progress-2 Station (69°22' and 76°22').

From July to August, there were practically no differences. In the summer, the wind direction 
changed within a day: easterly wind at night with gusts of more than 10 m/s attenuating during the 
daytime and changing to west-southwesterly wind.

The mean annual air temperature did not drop below -10°C with mean monthly temperatures 
rarely rising above 0°C. From April to July the temperature was practically constant.

The precipitation data are actually absent. According to the 1988 observation data, the 
precipitation from January to December comprised 213 mm. The maximum values were observed in 
September comprising 52.1 mm, and the minimum of 5.5 mm in October. From the 1989 
observations, the maximum precipitation was recorded in May comprising 46 mm. Winds play a 
significant role in the formation of snow fields capable both to create snow-drifts more than 2 m 
thick (from measurements) and reduce the thickness of the snow fields by more than a meter during 
the period with below zero temperatures. The sand transfer induced by wind plays an important role 
in this process, being abrasive.

Note that based on irregular observations on the glacier in the vicinity of the runway planned 
and simultaneous observations at a meteorological site near the Progress-1 station there are 
differences in the wind direction and strength. Thus on February 14, 1988 at the wind of about 5 
m/s, the wind direction of 90° at the runway and of 45° at Progress-1 were observed. Such 
deviations were recorded actually in all observations. The general trend in the deviations is that at 
strong winds the deviations decrease.
5.4. Current anthropogenic load on some environmental components of the Larsemann Hills

5.4.1. Chemical contamination. The preliminary results of studies at Progress-2 for the levels of 
oil hydrocarbons (OH) and heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Ca, Ni, Pb) in different media revealed in some 
cases an excess over the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). The greatest MPC excess for 
heavy metals was observed in snow sampled in 10 m from the diesel electric station (DES) in the 
WSW direction comprising 70 mcg/l melt water for iron (at the MPC of 50 mcg/l). The levels for 
copper also exceeded the MPC comprising 8.9 mcg/l melt water at the MPC of  5 mcg/l. 
Insignificant MPC excesses were also observed south of the DES equaling 57 mcg/l and 5.1 mcg/l 
melt water, respectively. In respect of other indicators, including lead, no MPC excess was detected 
in the samples. The Progress-2 station was not used for a long time whereas the samples whose 
analysis is given above were collected before the primary seasonal activities of the 43d RAE. 
Before this, the work at Progress-2 was performed only during the 34th RAE (in 1989). At this time, 
it is difficult to say what caused the elevated levels of iron and copper in the snow cover, and 
namely the residual or background phenomena connected with the geological structure of the station 
territory. The results of the analysis of snow, ice and water for oil hydrocarbons revealed their levels 
within the MPC. The maximum OH concentration was recorded in a small lake in direct proximity 
to the road to the Zhong Shan station. The OH concentration in water of this lake was 0.03 mg/l at 
the MPC of 0.05 mg/l. The oil hydrocarbons in snow sampled near the DES at Progress-2 is located 
near the road exiting to the glacier, therefore it is probable that the presence of OH in the 
aforementioned samples is due to the road being used by wintering personnel from the Zhong Shan 
station.

5.4.2. Technogenic load on the landscape. In addition to the station area, the following regions of 
the Hills are exposed to the largest technogenic load (primarily mechanic impact): in the region of 
the stream flowing to Lake Stepped, rise to and descent from the pass, a stream behind the pass and 
a shore along Mir Lake.

The active horizon thickness determines the actual possibility for the active surface change at 
mechanical impact. The most vulnerable in this respect are the landscape contours with well-drained 
sand soil or alternatively with constant flows. A road segment between the Progress-2 base and the 
Zhong Shan station presents such a contour. At this contour, the active horizon comprised 130 cm 
on January 10, 1999.

5.5. Biota

5.5.1. Microbial communities of the Progress station and adjoining territories. The study of the 
bacterial presence in the surface soil layer at Progress-2, as well as at the Law base was conducted 
during the seasonal activities of the 36th RAE.

The total level of the bacterial component in the soil samples varies over a wide range (between 
0.3 to 802.0 thousand microbial bodies/g). Both the highest and the lowest numbers of viable 
bacteria were revealed in the territory of the Progress station. The largest numbers of 
microorganisms were detected in the areas with pronounced biological contamination, such as soil 
under the medical block or near the fecal container, 802.0 and 761.0 thousand microbial bodies/g, 
respectively. The soil from the road near the medical block that also experiences significant 
technogenic loads, however, without a pronounced biological contamination, was exposed least of 
all to bacterial seeding. The numbers of viable microorganisms in the samples from the road near 
the lake with drinking water and from the road near the water intake location were close to this level 
although being greater by an order (1.5 and 3.0 thousand microbial bodies/g).
12

In the areas with pronounced biological contamination at the Progress-2 station and Law base, 
alien bacteria were detected, but their numbers were negligible compared to the natural microflora 
comprising not more than 0.3 %-0.7% from the total microbial background, respectively. In the 
samples collected from the roads, Progress-2 and the adjoining areas, no cells capable of vegetation 
were found among the alien microorganisms.

A distinguishing characteristic of the microbial community revealed in the soil from the Law 
base territory, was the presence of enteric bacteria in some portion of the samples (the direct 
evidence of human presence). Their numbers were negligible (around 100 microbial bodies/g), but 
the fact of their presence can point to a possible survival of these bacterial forms under the severe 
conditions of high latitudes. Under more favorable environmental conditions during the austral 
summer, the survived enteric bacteria can become a source of deep changes in the natural microbial 
communities formed.

Thus, the pilot studies of the bacterial presence in the soil samples from the Progress-2 station 
and the adjoining territories indicate an insignificant presence of alien microflora in the existing 
micro-biocenosis.

5.5.2. Lake ecosystems. The investigated water bodies of the Larsemann Hills are well-mixed, 
oligotrophic meltwater lakes (Gasparson et al., 1998). Freshwaters contain very small amounts of 
trace elements of environmental significance such as Pb, U, and Zn. The highest concentrations of 
trace metals were measured in samples of ground water from the shores of Lakes Nella and 
Cameron, and Sarah Tarn. These preliminary results indicate that groundwater may be the major 
source of metals in the lake systems.

Benthic communities dominate in the lakes of the Larsemann Hills. In spite of their 
considerable age, the lake cenoses are characterized by a low diversity compared with many other 
Antarctic regions. The microbial plankton is less diverse than in the lakes of the Dry Valleys. The 
diatoms have a particularly poor composition (Ellis-Evans, 1998). The cyano-bacterial mats are 
observed in the proposed activity area: Lakes Progress and Nella.

5.5.3. Terrestrial flora and vegetation. The terrestrial vegetation is very depleted, the local flora of 
the Hills is represented similar to the entire East Antarctica, by only non-vascular plants including 
algae, lichens, microscopic fungi and mosses. The plant communities on the Antarctic mainland are 
much rarer than separate populations of a single species. Due to separateness of the species within 
the population, the competition between them is poor or absent. Thus, the environmental factors 
have a decisive importance for the survival of the species. Only in the most favorable habitats, 
lichens and mosses form small groves with a total projective coverage not greater than 1%. The 
maximum development of the moss turf - a grove with an area up to 10 sq. m, was observed near 
the Progress-2 station. In the other regions, the grove size does not exceed several tens of sq. cm.

5.5.3.1. Mosses. No special bryological studies were carried out in the Hills. Based on the data on 
moss flora and its extent in East Antarctica and the nearby Vestfold Hills (Savich-Lyubetskaya 
1978, Seppelt, 1986), as well as on the evidence kindly provided by R. Seppelt an approximate list 
of Musci of the Larsemann Hills includes the following species:

• Grimmia lawiana
• Grimmia (Schistidium) anatrctici
• Bryum pseudotriquetrum (=B.algens)
13

- Bryum argenteum (?)
- Sarconeurom glaciale
- Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostrum

The species names are given according to (Seppelt, 1986), the synonyms of the names that were used in the article of Savich-Lyubetskaya (1978) are given in brackets.

5.5.3.2. Lichens. No special lichen studies were carried out in the Larsemann Hills. Samples on an opportunity basis were taken near the Progress-2 station in 1988 (Andreyev, 1990a), as well as on Lichen Island (Law, 1959). As can be seen from the list, 13 species are known in the lichen flora of the continental part of the Larsemann Hills. In terms of bio-geography, most lichens are widespread bi-polar species. The endemic species were not detected. In the collection from the nearby Vestfold Hills, 22 lichen species were recorded. It is obvious that for deriving a complete understanding of the lichen flora in the Larsemann Hills, additional studies are necessary.

- Acarospora petalima (A. gwynnii*). Epilythophite.
- Acarospora williamsii (It is probably only an ecological form of a widespread species A. badiofusca).
- Buellia frigida (Rinodina frigida***)
- Physcia caesia (Physcia caesioides***). Epilythophite, bryophite, nitrophyl.
- Rinodina petermannii. Epilythophite, nitrophyl.
- Rinodina olivaceobrunnea (turfacea - in the original**). Bryophite.
- Candelariella antarctica (C. flava*). Nitrophyl.
- Lecanora expectans (L. griseomarginata***)
- Lecidea cancriformis. Epilythophite. Very close to the later described species L. phillipsiana.
- Pseudephebe minuscula. Epilythophite
- Caloplaca nigrescens. Bryophite.
- Umbilicaria decussata. Epilythophite
- Lepraria neglecta.

Since the systematics of the flora of spore plants of the Antarctic is quite complicated and the nomenclature is quite confusing, the synonyms of the names as well as some corrections kindly made by Dr. Seppelt are given in brackets).

* - synonyms given in Andreev's (1990b) paper which is devoted to a detailed description of lichens in the Bunger Hills.

** - according to Dr. Seppelt, Rinodina olivaceobrunnea is observed in the continental Antarctica rather than R. turfacea, as in the original paper (Andreev, 1990b).

*** - synonyms given according to Seppelt (1986).

5.5.3.3. Alien flora. In addition to local plants, in 1995 alien species of vascular plants were observed in the Larsemann Hills. At the territory of the Progress-2 station near the staircase of the medical block, a grass turf was found with a size of 1.5ô1 m, consisting of 17 individuals of herbaceous plants. The plants were quite well-developed with specimen of 20 cm in diameter. Some of them were in the state of blooming and seeding. There were also non-identified dead specimens of seeding plants. The same plants were found inside the medical block in the flower box. Probably, the ripe seeds from the plants were swept with garbage out of doors and germinated there.
The results of determining the alien plants (identification was made by ....):
    Alopecurus geniculatus (fam. Graminea), widespread in northwestern Russia
    Puccinellia distans - (fam. Graminea), natural status - a European semi-weed species, alien in many countries of both hemispheres.
        Rumex pulcher (fam. Polygonacea) - an American species, widespread as an alien plant in the West European countries. It is not yet observed in flora of northwestern Russia).
        Stellaria media - (fam. Caryophyllacea), widespread over the entire globe, persistent weed, alien in many areas of the Arctic.
    Chenopodium rubrum - (fam. Chenopodiacea) widespread in northwestern Russia being a weed and ruderal plant (absent in the Arctic flora)
    (Burgess. pers. com.)

5.5.4. Terrestrial invertebrates. No special studies of the fauna of terrestrial invertebrates were made in the Larsemann Hills. Based on the data obtained for the nearby Vestfold Hills general information on the fauna of freely living invertebrates of continental Antarctica (Rounssevell & Horne, 1986), the species of the following taxonomic groups obviously should be observed in the study territory
    • Acarina
    • Tardigrada
    • Nematoda

5.5.5. Birds. The bird fauna of the region is poor in terms of the species composition and the population numbers is low. Five species are recorded in the territory of the Larsemann Hills.

Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)

At present it does not breed in the Hills, but is constantly observed at the coast. The nearest colonies are located on Bulingen Island (445 pairs from the counts of 1981-82) and on Lichen Island (ca. 20 pairs/1973-74), which are in 10 km west and in 20 km southwest of the Stornes Peninsula, respectively. Two colonies are also known on the Steinness Islands (134 + 1042 pairs from the 1981-1982 counts) in 8 km south of the Larsemann Hills (Whitehead, Johnstone, 1990).

Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri)

The nearest colony is located in Amanda Bay in 30 km from the Larsemann Hills numbering some 10,000 pairs (Woehler, 1993). The Emperor Penguins are rear but regular visitors of the coasts of the Larsemann Hills.

South-Polar Skua (Catharacta maccormicki)

This is the most noticeable bird of the region, being the only surface  nesting species of the Larsemann Hills that does not avoid neighboring with man. From the results of the 1988-1993 counts, a total of 17 pairs of skuas inhabited the area of the Mirror and Broknes Peninsulas with the adjoining smaller islands, although the numbers of breeding birds varied from year to year and not all pairs bred every year (Wang Z., et al., 1996).

Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea) and Wilson's Storm-Petrel (Oceanites oceanicus)

These are common nesting species of the Larsemann Hills. Their nests are located rock cevices.
5.5.5. Mammals

Weddell Seal (Leptonychotes weddelli)

The Weddell seal is common on landfast ice near the coast of the Larsemann Hills. Pupping falls on October. No counts of the population numbers were made.

6. CONSIDERATION OF IMPACTS

6. 1. Possible impact factors associated with proposed activity

The combination of air operation and land based support operations includes a number of activities that either directly or indirectly interact with the environment. In each case, the potential environmental impact can be derived from the causal connection between the nature of the given activity and the biophysical attributes of the recieving environment . Given the project activity in Larsemann Hills as described above the corresponding specific activities and impact factors, respectively, are listed in a Table 7 .

6.2. Data and methods

The methods developed in previous EIAs both in the Arctic and the Antarctic were used to assess the scale of the environmental impact of activities associated with the compacted-snow runway construction and the following air operations. Valuable documents whose experience was used include in particular, the Reports of Gendrin and Giuliani (1994), Shears (1995) and Tomassen with co-authors (1996, 1998).

In this EIA, we use a similar approach as that used in the papers above to identify the predicted impacts of the runway project. A modified matrix method was adapted to specify elements of activity, impact characteristics and their possible mitigation. Each identified environmental impact has been subdivided into one of four categories: nil or negligible, low, medium and high. Criteria for assessing the level of impact are shown in Table 8.

Table 8. Criteria for assessing the level of environmental impacts associated with the compacted snow runway construction in the Larsemann Hills area

|---|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | nil or negligible | no impact or impact would not be detected                                                                                 |
| L | low impact     | low magnitude impact limited in space (local or site extent) and time (occur over a time period less or equal as compared to generation of the resource a value being considered; or recovery of the resource or  value after removing the influence of the activity will take approximately one generation). |
| M | medium impact  | impact having moderate pertubation which can be statistically detected, or short or medium term impact of regional scale (extending over the entire LH area), or long term low impact over the site scale extent |
| H | high impact    | impact of large perturbation magnitude, impacted features not to recover, or long term or moderate magnitude impacts of more then site extent. |

The rankings of different categories of impact in the matrix are based on value judgements.
These judgements were based on current scientific and technical knowledge, and where possible,
made after examining the results of the environmental study made during last two seasons (1997-98,
1998-99). Published results of other studies on the Larsemann Hills environment have been used.
The Matrix includs two section for each period of activities (Table 9).

6.3. Impacts on abiotic component

6.3.1 Air. Construction and transport activities will produce emission  of exhausted gases from
vehicles processing snow at runway site. Emission from diesel generator at the air field camp also
will be a direct atmospheric impact during limited period when the camp will be in use. Exhaust
gazes will be quickly dispersed and carried out into Prydz Bay by prevailing south-easterly winds,
aerosol and particulate matter will also spread around the contamination sources or be deposited to
the surface depending on the weather conditions. Considering the low power of the diesel generator
and limited time when the vehicles will be in use, atmospheric effects from exhaust gazes are likely
to be local and transient.

The heavy aircraft operations will increase an air emission of exhausted gases over the hills.
However, the exaust gases will be quickly carried off the snow surface and rapidly and thoroughly
dispersed into upper layers of atmosphere because of the high altitude the aircraft
operated.Moreover, since using heavy aircraft RAE will decrease in total amount of flying hours in
the Larsemann Hills area. It is because the introduction of heavy aircraft in RAE' logistics will
minimize currently required amount of flying hours for helicopter that now is the main transport in
use at the area. For instance, on a single flight Ilyushin-76 may transport a payload of 40 tons from
Australia to the Larsemann Hills area. The aircraft flying time on low altitude in the area would be
less than an hour. Whereas, it takes about 20 flying hours to transport the equal load by helicopter
in case of ship-shore unloading operations. So, eventually the heavy aircraft introduction will
reduce the environmental impact of the RAE logistics.

6.3.2. Snow and glacier. The 121600 m^(2)  of natural snow covering the ice sheet will be
disturbed on runway site. The construction and maintenance procedure consists of three main
methods of snow processing: desegregating, dragging and compacting. However, the only result the
snow is affected during construction and maintenance will be its temporary compressing. The total
thickness of compressed snow layer within the runway perimeter will be approximately 1.0 m in a
year after construction beginning. In following years of the runway maintenance, the thickness of
the top compressed snow layer will be increasing in due course of the natural snow accumulation.
The increased snow density at runway site will lead to minor change in the process of natural snow
metamorphosing.

Solid and aerosol particles from the exhaust  gases of different origin (ground transport, aircraft
and diesel-generator) will spread and deposit onto the snow surface around the contamination
sources at a different distance depending on the meteorological conditions.

Also there could be a localized impact on the runway site from minor leaks of fuel and anti-icing
liquid. The main sources of fuel leaks are fuel tanks and pipelines. Minor fuel leaks may
contaminate snow at the fuel tank site and at the airfield camp site. A fuel contamination of snow at
the runway could be occurred by small spills during refueling vehicles and aircraft. Fuel
contamination, will cause increased melting and then lead to minor changes in the local, seasonal

meltwater drainage system. However, good fuel handling procedures and use of operational transport 
should keep such leakages minimal.

6.3.3. Ground and soil. There will be a localized impact on the field camp area, fuel tank site from 
minor fuel leaks. The main sources of fuel leaks are fuel tanks and pipelines. Minor fuel leaks may 
contaminate soil sediments and come from contaminated melted water at the fuel tank site and at the 
air camp site. Proper fuel handling procedures, use of operational transport should keep fuel leakages 
minimal.

Another source of ground and soil contamination will be deposition of aerosols from the exhaust 
gases containing soot and heavy metals. Given a low traffic activity and, predominant E-wind 
direction and a low power of the diesel-generator, the contamination from the deposition of exhaust 
gases can be considered as likely less than minor.

Traffic along  the road during the warm time of the year may result in various mechanical 
disturbances in the substrate connected with the soil motion and its disturbed mechanical structure. 
To avoid it the traffic is planned during the cold time of the year on the snow cover. In case where 
transportation on the gravel is needed, a number of measures should be undertaken to minimize the 
damage.

6.3.4. Lakes. Minor contamination of the water bodies may be resulted by precipitation of aerosol 
from exhaust gases containing soot and trace metals to its surface, as well as due to melt water from 
snow contaminated with aerosol. Given a low traffic intensity and a lower power of the diesel-
generator, the contamination from the deposition of exhaust gases can be considered as short-term 
and local. Proper procedures for use of operational transport should keep impact on lakes minimal.

6.4. Impacts on biota

6.4.1.Hydrobionts. (See Lakes). The short-term period and far distance of the activity can not result 
toxic effects and increased mortality of hydrobionts.

6.4.2.Vegetation. Both lichens and mosses are good accumulators of a number of contaminants 
spreading in air and water media since they absorb water with the entire body surface. In addition, 
lichens also have air feeding. The depositing soot and dust will disturb the photosynthesis and 
respiration processes of plants.

Mosses and lichens growing along the road, as well as in the leeward zone from the exhaust gas 
sources will be exposed most of all to contamination. Of contaminants, heavy metals will 
accumulate first of all. Foluose and fruticose lichens will be most vulnerable to contamination. The 
Antarctic plants especially lichens differ in extremely low growth rates, which governs their 
increased vulnerability to mechanical damage. Since terrestrial vegetation in the Larsemann Hills is 
distributed in separate rare patches, such motion routes should be chosen that do not disturb the 
moss-lichen turf.

To prevent damage the main traffic is planned during the cold time of the year on the snow cover. 
In cases where transport is required to move on the gravel the road used several times should be 
used. When moving on foot, it is necessary to avoid areas with developed vegetation.

6.4.3. Invertebrates. Contamination of soils, ground and vegetation turf can result in external 
contamination of invertebrates inhabiting it, accumulation of pollutants in their organisms, which 
might induce insignificant toxic effects. However, given the low contamination levels, the damage 
incurred on terrestrial invertebrates can be considered as local and insignificant.

6.4.4. Birds and seals. There are neither penquin nor seal colonies at close proximity of the 
proposed runway site and air field camp. Very low intensity of planned flying activity and far 
position of the runway against the location of colonies of birds and seals  could conclude the impact
as short-term and low. Noise produced by vehicles moving along the access route will be a minor 
source of disturbance to some few pairs of skuas breeding in the vicinity. However, given the low 
level of planned activity, the impact of noise on birds and mammals can be considered as local and 
insignificant.

As it was reported by Wang and co-authors (1996) the skuas readily forage at garbage damps and 
take food refuse in Larsemann Hills. Human activity influences distribution patterns of so-called 
skua clubs over the hills territory. An access to human-derived food is suggested to affect breeding 
success in some pairs. However, some food remains could be hazardous to birds due to presence of 
alien pathogenic organisms. Proper handling of waste should exclude such impact completely.

6.4.5. Microbial communities. Human presence and life activities in new places will lead to 
biological contamination by alien bacteria. Further consequences of such an impact are still 
uncertain, but enteric bacteria in favorable conditions could bloom and cause human disease in the 
case of occurring in drinking water. Proper handling of waste and excrement should keep biological 
contamination minimal.

Given the restricted scale of the increasing human presence in the hills, as well as quite low 
indicators of the current spreading of alien microflora, this impact can be considered as long-term in 
time but local and minimal  by perturbation level, i.e. minor and transitory.

Casual pollution of soil, vegetation and water bodies may lead to changes in habitat conditions for 
microorganisms and their food sources, and consequently cause changes in community structure, 
viability of microorganisms and disturb process of organic matter turn-over.

Proper fuel handling procedures and use of operational transport should keep fuel leakages and 
pollution of exhaust gases at minimal level.

6.5. Impacts on human values

6.5.1.Wilderness. Taking in to account that the activity is planned in same site where old runway 
facilities were constructed and no pristine areas are to be disturbed, the impact on a wilderness will 
have no more than a minor.

6.5.2. Human health. Construction of new runway will improve human safety in case emergency 
evacuation. (Also see Microbial community.)

6.5.3. Science. Scientific researches at Larsemann Hills will be greatly enhanced by using aircraft. It 
helps to organize early start of scientific season, to maximize research productivity by reducing 
travel time to Antarctica and back, to use possibility for senior scientists to attend field researches 
and to enhance the quality of national Antarctic program.

6.6. Cumulative impacts in the light of existing and proposed activities

The cumulative impacts result from the superimposition of impacts due to the activity under 
consideration that add to impacts due to previous activities in the same area.

6.6.1.Increase of personnel at Progress Station. The snow runway construction will make to 
increase human activity at Porgress Station and surrounding, in particularly during summer seasons. 
This will have a cumulative impact. An important result of the increase of personnel will be the 
production of increased amount of waste.  However, the all fuel and hazardous waste should be 
removed from Antarctica. When the runway is operational the quantities of waste to be removed will 
probably increase by 20 % compared to the present level.

6.6.2. Deployment of airfield camp. A cumulative impact will be raised by establishment of small 
field to support the runway construction and maintenance on ultimate rock outcrops of the 
Larsemann Hills 2 km northward of the runway site (Figure 2). The camp will comprise three
22

houses: accommodation house, powerhouse combined with workshop, radio/nav aids house. The total area to be disturbed by the field camp deployment will be approximately 400 m^(2). There are no any birds nesting in the airfild camp area. On the other hand such small-scale developments may be of little consequence in comparison of major sources of impact from the main station activity.

7. MINIMIZING AND MITIGATING MEASURES

7.1. Development planning
The RAE established a Progress Redevelopment Working Group with the overall purpose of establishing of the rules on environmental protections of the Larsemann Hills.
The RAE Environmental Officer was a member of the Working Group and ensured that the provisions of the Environmental Protocol, particularly as regards waste disposal, were clearly incorporated into the management plan.

7.2. Environmental education
The RAE introduces all new personnel into the environmental and waste management including stuff to be constructing the runway before they travel to Antarctica. All personnel are given a copy of the Antarctic Treaty Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic.

7.3 Waste management
All waste from the field camp and runway will be transported to the Progress Station.

7.4 Fuel handling
The risk of a fuel spills is low, and will be reduced further as special precautions will be put in place where fuel operations.

7.5. Determination of unavoidable impacts
The following impacts associated with compacted snow runway construction and further exploitation are considered unavoidable:
• snow compacting
• short-term emission of exhaust gases from aircraft, vehicles, field camp power generator
• short-term noise from aircraft operations, traffic along the access route
• short-term electro-magnetic waves emission
• local disturbance of the surface by mooving vehicles
• local disturbance of the surface by walking people
• local area claim for field camp deployment
• visual disturbance of landscape by runway marks establishment
Observance of the rules and guidances will keep the impacts listed above at a minimal level.

8. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

A monitoring program is necessary to identify and assess any expected or unexpected impacts of the proposed activity. It would be difficult to establish an extensive ecological monitoring program due to lack of background information regarding many important environmental components, and long-term previous inputs into the environment from sources other then considered activity. Some proposals are given in paragraph 10.

9. CONCLUSION

Present Initial Environmental Evaluation indicates that the construction and exploitation of the compacted snow runway are likely to have no more than a minor or transitory  impact on the Antarctic environment, provided the recommended mitigating measures are carried out. It is therefore considered that a Comprehencive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) need not be prepared.
