Preliminary Report

XXII ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING
LIMA, Peru

May 25th. to June 4th., 1999
During the 1998-99 season the Antarctic Unit of the Tourism Board of Tierra del Fuego 
carried out its survey programme of tourist operations to Antarctica through the Port of Ushuaia.

The information was obtained on the basis of the questionnaire approved by the 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Resolution 3 (1997), called Post Visit Report. The data 
was given by the Expedition Leaders of each of the Antarctic Tour Operator Companies.

It should be noted that this work only refers to those trips that called at the Port of 
Ushuaia.

Transit of ships and passengers through the Port of Ushuaia

√ During the 1998-99 season 93 trips were carried out to Antarctica from the port of Ushuaia, 
carrying a total of 9,192 passengers.

√ There were 68 local trips (those that started AND ended in Ushuaia) that is the 73% of the 
total. The remaining 25 trips were semi-local (they began OR finished in Ushuaia) with a 27%. 
As in the last 3 seasons no in-transit trips were made (those which didn't begin NEITHER 
finished in Ushuaia, but made a stop in the mentioned port during their journey).

√ 14 Antarctic Tourist ships operated through the local Port during this season, being 5 of 
Russian flag, 5 of Bahamas, 2 of Liberia, 1 of Denmark and 1 of Panama.

√ The maximum capacity of the cruises ranged between 49 and 800 passengers. The small 
ships (up to 100 passengers) carried 3,481 passengers in 56 trips, the medium ships (between 
101 and 299 passengers) carried 3,534 passengers in 33 trips, and the large ships (300 
passengers or more) made 4 trips with 2,177 passengers.

√ Also, during the present season the data of 4 charter yachts was obtained. They made a total 
of 6 trips through the Port of Ushuaia, carrying 52 passengers with a variable duration of 4 
weeks.

 Table 1 of the Annex indicates for each ship: the flag, the tour operator, the maximum 
capacity of passengers, the total number of joumeys and the total number of passengers 
involved from the port of Ushuaia.

 Table 2 of the Annex shows the characteristics of the previously mentioned charter yachts.

Comparative analysis with previous seasons

✓ By drawing a comparison with previous seasons, an increase in the amount of trips and number of passengers during the 1998-99 season has been observed. Regarding to the number of trips the increase reaches the 12%, while the number of passengers represents the 7%.

ⓘ Table 3 of the Annex shows the evolution of Antarctic Tourism through Ushuaia during the last 8 seasons. The corresponding percentage variations in relation to previous year are also included.

Comparative analysis of Antarctic ship-borne tourism going through
Ushuaia with world figures

✓ During this last season, a world-wide increase was also observed in the number of passengers that visited Antarctica by sea. According to the information given by IAATO, we estimated a total of 9,907 passengers visiting Antarctica through different gateways. From this total, 9,192 passengers went through the local port at least once. This means that 93% of the passengers called at the port of Ushuaia in their journey to Antarctica by sea, and also confirms that Ushuaia is the most active 'Antarctic Gateway'.

ⓘ Table 4 of the Annex compares the flow of Antarctic tourists going through Ushuaia and the world-wide total of passengers that visited Antarctica by sea in the last 8 seasons. In addition, a bar chart has been made with the same figures comparison from 1992-93 season up to the last one.

Sites visited in the Antarctic and Subantartic Area

✓ The main visited places in the Antarctic area during the 1998-99 season were: Port Lockroy (Wiencke Island), Whaler's Bay (Deception Island), Pendulum Cove (Deception Island), Half Moon Island, Cuverville Island, Hannah Point (Livingston Island), Paulet Island, Neko Harbour, Petermann Island, Waterboat Point (Paradise Bay). The total number of passengers that visited each site was considered for this selection.
