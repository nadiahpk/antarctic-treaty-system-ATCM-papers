XXIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
 
 
 
 
Referring to item 4 of the provisional annotated agenda of the Meeting "Operation of the 
Antarctic Treaty System", sub-item "Secretariat" Denmark would like to make the following 
observations: 
 
 
Like other Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, Denmark received in October 1998 Professor 
RÃ¼diger Wolfrum's letter indicating the termination of his chairmanship for the Antarctic Treaty 
Secretariat Contact Group. In the absence of a successor to Professor Wolfrum until further 
notice, it therefore appears most appropriate that the following message is communicated to the 
Host Country of ATCM XIII for further consideration by the Meeting: 
 
 
Denmark reaffirms its support for the establishment of an Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, 
which should be small and cost-effective, but remains flexible with respect to its composition 
(that might draw on existing resources) as well as its location. Concerning the budget Denmark 
reiterates its opinion communicated in the past to the chairman of the control group that in 
principle all costs should be borne by the Consultative Parties that will predominantly benefit by 
the Secretariat, being relieved of some duties and functions hitherto permformed by these Parties 
in their capacity as ATCM host countries. The non-consultative parties should not directly or 
indirectly pay for services/information to which they are entitled free of charge under the 
existing Antarctic Treaty System.
