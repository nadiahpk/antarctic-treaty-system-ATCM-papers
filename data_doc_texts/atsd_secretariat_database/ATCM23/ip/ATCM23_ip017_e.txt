IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires 
each Party to report annually on the steps they have taken to implement the Protocol, 
including how it has ensured compliance with the Protocol through the adoption of laws 
and regulations, administrative actions and enforcement measures (see article 13(3) of 
the Protocol). 
 
Article 17 also requires each Party to report on contingency plans established for 
response to incidents with potential adverse effects on the Antarctic environment and 
associated ecosystems (see article 15(1)(b)).  Further to this, Resolution 1 (1997) 
recommends Parties to carry out regular contingency exercises and to report on the 
results of the exercises to the ATCM. 
 
The UK carried out a disaster contingency exercise in March 1999. A brief report of the 
exercise is provided below. 
 
No further legislation or regulations concerning the Protocol have entered into force in 
the UK since ATCM XXII, when it was reported that the provisions of the Antarctic Act 
1994 were fully in force.  The 1998/99 austral season was the first season all of the 
provisions of the Antarctic Act 1994 were implemented. 
 
A list of all permits issued under the Antarctic Act 1994 during the 1998/99 season is 
attached as an annex to this paper. 
 
 
DISASTER CONTINGENCY EXERCISE 
 
In accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol and Articles 12 of Annex IV, the UK has 
continued to develop a contingency plan to put in place all necessary procedures to 
respond to incidents that might occur in Antarctica. 
 
Based on the draft contingency plan a two day paper exercise was undertaken in March 
1999, involving the British Antarctic Survey, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
and Adventure Network International (ANI) as well as the Royal Navy’s Ice Patrol 
vessel, HMS Endurance, operating in the South Atlantic.  Passenger evacuation and 
pollution control strategies were implemented. 
 
The primary aim of the exercise was to test the contingency plan and the ability of the 
UK’s Antarctic assets to respond to a disaster in the Antarctic. 
 
Based on the findings of the exercise the contingency plan is to be developed further.  
Emergency response exercise will continue to be undertaken on an annual basis.
