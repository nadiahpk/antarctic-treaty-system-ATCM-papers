SCAR COMPOSITE GAZETTEER OF ANTARCTICA 
 
Information Paper submitted by SCAR to XXIII ATCM 
 
Agenda Item 15 
 
Publication of the Composite Cazetteer of Antarctica (CCA) by the SCAR Working Croup 
on Ceodesy and Ceographic Information is a major milestone in the evolution of Antarctic 
toponymy. It has taken six years to produce, and contains 21,552 names representing 
16,563 geographic features, sourced from 20 national Antarctic gazetteers and one 
international agency. The publication has been designed to avoid any value judgement 
regarding precedence or form of the various place names. It is available in both printed and 
on-line formats. 
 
The on-line address is: < http://www.pnra.it/SCAR_GAZE > 
 
The sources for the first edition of the gazetteer are: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, 
Bulgaria, Chile, China, France, Cermany, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, 
Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, Uruguay, United States of America, 
and the Ceneral Bathymetric Chart of the ocean. 
 
It is noted that around 5OO geographic features have two or more different names, creating 
the potential for fatal misunderstandings in position reports ~y sea, air and land travellers, 
and ambiguity in describing the location of scientific observations. An immediate benefit 
of the publication is that national Antarctic geographic names authorities will now be able 
to avoid approving new names for already-named geographic features, by first referring to 
the CCA. 
 
The g~zetteer will be up-dated and further developed by SCAR, with the addition of new 
names and sources, and dates of approval and descriptions for each name. The major 
contribution of Italy's Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide in producing the first 
edition of the CCA is gratefully acknowled~ed. 
 
The attached brochure provides further details on the CCA.
