Basic data and environmental indicators for the development 
of management plans for landing sites in Antarctica  
that are particularly heavily frequented by visitors 
 
 
 
The Federal Environmental Agency has commissioned the following R+D Project 
(Project No. 29819 159, duration: two years): 
 
 
Parameters of relevance for the detection of (environmental) impacts of touristic and 
other activities on Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites, and an assessment methodology are to 
be developed. Based on the results of this work, environmental indicators and 
environmental quality objectives are to be drawn up for the areas of Antarctic ecosystems 
specified in Article 3 (Environmental principles) para. 2 a) - b) of the Protocol), and then 
tested in practice taking the highly frequented landing sites Hannah Point and Penguin 
Island as examples. 
 
 
The results of the Antarctic Site Inventory Project (see Compendium of Antarctic 
Peninsula Visitor Sites) have shown that the landing sites Hannah Point and Penguin Island 
exhibit a large number of site-specific sensitivities to visitor pressures and are experiencing 
high visitor loads. The two sites distinguish themselves by a high level of biodiversity. 
 
 
Should the assessment show that the activities in question can be expected to have 
considerable impacts on the landing sites, proposa~s are to be made as to how these 
impacts can be prevented or minimised and whether there is the need to designate those 
areas as "Antarctic Specially Managed Areas".
