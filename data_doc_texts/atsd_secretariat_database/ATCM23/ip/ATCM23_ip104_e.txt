DECLARATION BY THE ORIENTAL REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY

The Coverment of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay considers that, through
its accession to the Antarctic Treaty signed at Washington (United States of
America) on December 1, 1959, it helps to affirm the principles of using

Antarctica exclusively for peaceful purposes, of prohibiting any nuclear explosion
or radioactive waste disposal in this area, of freedom of scientific research

in Antarctica in the service of mankind, and of international cooperation to
achieve these objectives, which are established in said treaty.

Within the context of these principles Uruguay proposes, through a procedure
based on the principle of legal equality, the establishment of a general and
definitive statute on Antarctica in which, respecting the rights of States as
recognized in international law, the interests of all States involved and of
the international community as a whole would be considered equitably.

The decision of the Uruguayan Government to accede to the Antarctic Treaty
is based not only on the interest which, like all members of the international
community, Uruguay has in Antarctica, but also on a special, direct, and
substantial interest which arises from its geographic location, from the fact
that its Atlantic coastline faces the continent of Antarctica, from the resultant
influence upon its climate, ecology, and marine biology, from the historic bonds
which date back to the first expeditions which ventured to explore the continent
and its waters, and also from the obligations assumed in conformity with the
-2-

Inter-American Treaty d Reciprocal Assistance which includes a portion of 
Antarctic territory in the zone described in Article 4, by virtue of which 
Uruguay shares the responsibility of defending the region.

In comunicating its decision to accede to the Antarctic Treaty, the 
Goverment d the Oriental Republic of Uruguay declares that it reserves its 
rights in Antarctica in accordance with international law.
REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY


El Gobierno de la República Oriental del Uruguay considera 
que, con su adhesión al Tratado de la Antártida suscrito en Washing-
ton (Estados Unidos de América) el 1o. de diciembre de 1959, contri-
ye a afirmar los principios del uso de la Antártida exclusivamen:e 
para fines pacíficos, de prohibición de toda explosión nuclear y de 
la eliminación de desechos radioactivos en esa área, de la libertad 
de investigación científica en la Antártida puesta al servicio de la 
Humanidad y de la cooperación internacional para el logro de esos ob-
jetivos, que consagra el mencionado Tratado.


Dentro del marco de esos principios, el Uruguay propugnarà, 
mediante-cuales:procedimientos basado en el principio de igualdad --
jurídica, por el establecimiento de un estatuto general y defini-
tivo para la Antártida, en el que, respetándose los derechos-que reco-
noce a los Estados el Derecho Internacional, se complemen equitativi-
vane:te los intereses de todos los Estados involucrados y de la Comu-
nidad internacional en su conjunto.


La decisión del Gobierno uruguayo de adherir al Tratado de 
la Antártida se funda no solamente en el interés que, como todo miem-
bro de la Comunidad Internacional, tiene el Uruguay en la Antártida 
sino, además, en un interés especíal, directo y sustancial derivado 
de su situación geográfica del existiramient de su-cos:a antártica -
al continente an-ártico, de la influencia que éste-ejerce en su clima,
en su ecología y en su biología marina, de los vínculos históricos que 
lo ligan desde las primeras expediciones que se aventuraron a explorar
dicho continente y sus aguas, así como de las obligaciones asumidas 
conforme al Tratado Interamericano de Asistencia Recíproca que incluye
una parte del territorio antártico en la zona descrita en el ar-
tículo 4o. por virtud de lo cual el Uruguay coparticipa en la res-
ponsabilidad de la defensa de la región.

     En ocasión de comunicar su decisión de adherir al Trata-
do de la Antártida, el Gobierno de la República Oriental del Uruguay 
declara que deja reservados los derechos que le corresponden en la 
Antártida de acuerdo con el Derecho Internacional.

The Embassy of the Argentine Republic presents its
compliments to the Department of State and has the honor to
enclose, in compliance with specific instructions from its
Government, the following Declaration to be registered
together with the Instrument of Ratification of the Protocol
of the Antarctic Treaty on the Protection of the

as the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on the Protection of
the Environment is a complementary Agreement of the
Antarctic Treaty and that its Article 4 fully respects what
has been stated in Article IV, Subsection 1, Paragraph A) of
said Treaty, none of its stipulations should be interpreted
or be applied as affecting its rights, based on legal
titles, acts of possession, contiguity and geographical
continuity in the region South of Parallel 60. in which it
has proclaimed and maintained its sovereignty."

The Embassy of the Argentine Republic avails
itself of this opportunity to reiterate to the Department of
State the assurances of its highest consideration.
