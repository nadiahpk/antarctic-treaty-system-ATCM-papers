A Travelling Exhibition of Antarctica 
 
 
An exhibition of "Antarctica and Japanese Antarctic Activities" (XXII ATCM/IP117) 
was held at the National Science Museum in Tokyo, Japan from July to November 1997. 
Approximately 290,000 people visited the exhibition, a great success for us. With this 
excellent response, the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, which 
supervises Antarctic research activities, planned an additional travelling exhibition and 
budgeted 200 million yen for this four-year project. 
 
In the first year (1997), a mobile storage unit was introduced to make transportation of 
the exhibition easier. The travelling exhibition started in 1998 and will make a tour of 18 
cities throughout Japan by the year.
