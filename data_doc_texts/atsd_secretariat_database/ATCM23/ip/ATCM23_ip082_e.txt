Opening Statement by the Representative of Brazil 
 
Mr. Chairman 
 
on behalf the Brazilian Government, I wish to thank the Government of Peru for its hospitality in hosting 
this meeting and for the impeccable facilities put available for all participants. We welcome the initiative 
to make the meeting documents available on Internet which has improved a lot our prior  preparation for 
this meeting. 
 
We must be proud of all achievements reached in this 4O years of the Antarctic Treaty which culminates 
now with the recent entry into force of the Madrid Protocol. However, there are matters that need to be 
resolved. For instance, the Annex V is not yet in force. our delegation hopes that this matter will be 
discussed in this meeting and that the Protocol can be given full effect. Brazil, in agreement with its 
neighbor operators, has step forward to exercise the Protocol by creating an Antarctic Special Managed 
Area in Admiralty Bay. 
 
The programs of training and environmental education are been reviewed constantly, under the new rules 
set by the Protocol, to better prepare our expeditioners to performance their jobs in Antarctica. 
 
A further priority for the meeting should be to reach an agreement on rules relating to the liability for 
environment damage. The Brazilian Government believes that the liability regime should express the 
reality of the Antarctic environment without compromising the logistic and scientific activity. 
 
My delegation looks forward to working with our colleagues in Lima to ensure continued success of the 
Antarctic Treaty.
