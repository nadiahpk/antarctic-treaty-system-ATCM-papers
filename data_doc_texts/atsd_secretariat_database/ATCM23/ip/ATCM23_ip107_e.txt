Progress Report on the Development of HSM No 71 
 
A site survey of the old whaling station and adyacent areas to Whalers Bay, Deception Island in the South Shetland 
archipelago war conducted at the end of 1996 by Norwegian and Chilean researchers. Whalers Bay encompasses 
three HSM's: 
 
31. Memorial plaque marking the position of a cemetery where some 45 whalers of Norwegian and other 
nationalities were buried in the first half of the twentieth century. 
 
58. Cairn with memorial plaque in honor of Captain Adolfus Armandus Andresen who was first to establish a 
whaling operation on Deception Island in 19O6. 
 
71. 
Ruins of the Norwegian whaling station established in 1911-12. 
 
The above language is merely descriptive of these HSM's and does not entirely correspond to the specific language 
approved by the respective ATCM's 
 
Since the first survey in 1996, the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) has carried out two visits during the austral 
summers 1997-98 and 1998-99, both in the expedition vessel ISAZA charted from the Chilean Navy. 
 
INACH scientists hace mapped the site using theodolite and other instruments and have gradually developed a 
system of signpost to indicate not only the location of HMS no 71 but also the nature, historical importance and 
specific function of the installations and artefacts in Walers Bay. 
 
During the last survey some disturbing elements emerged, which taken together with previous antecedents present a 
challenge to the integrity of all three historic sites in Walers Bay: 
 
1. The memorial plaque marking the posi~ion of the cemetery no longer exists. A memorial cross erected to the 
south west of the cemetery correctly identifies the birth and death dates of a whaler buried in the cemetery but has 
been located in a position far removed from the boundaries of the historic site. Two coffins have surfaced and lie 
abandoned in the vicinity of the cementery swept away by the volcanic eruption of February 1969. 
 
2. The cairn and plaque to honor Captain Andresen no longer exist. The plaque was donated by Norway and 
brought by a delegation of the Nor~vegian Storting, and the cairn was erected with the assistance of the Chilean Air 
Force. 
3. The very unstable condition of the buildings at Whalers Bay, with the single exception of the hangar which used 
to house the British airplanes, is both a concern for safety of visitors and for the preservation of key elements 
of the historic site. 
 
4. A Site Plan of HSM nQ 71 based on drawings existent in the Nor vegian and the Scott Polar Research Institutes 
Archives was removed depriving visitors of a convenient orientation map. 
 
We would like to suggest some possible avenues to cope in the very inmediate future with these adverse effects 
on the preservation of the historic sites in Whalers Bay. 
 
a) With regard to the cemetery and proceeding on the results of a survey carried out by personnel from INACH and 
the Chilean Air Force shortly before the volcanic eruption, as well as with the assistance of available historic 
records, a more complete listing of the graveyards has been compiled. This information attents, whenever possible, 
to identify the causes and circumstances of death for each of the whalers buried in Deception. 
 
b) Given the fact that a photographic record exists on the structures characterizing the cemetery it should be 
possible to portray at an appropriate place this burial place in its contemporary image. 
 
c) Steps should be taken by the proponents to reestablish the cairn and plaque in memory of Captain Andresen. 
However, once restored, the issue of preservation of the monument or site arises. 
 
d) As to the state of the main buildings of the former whaling station, after~vards Base B of the UK, has led the 
British Antarctic Survey (BAS) to post warnings on those buildings and give notice to some tour operators to 
prevent, as far as possible, access from visitors to those premises pending their eventual restoration. 
 
e) The same would apply to signposts. In document WP ~3 (Agend Item 14) concerning a joint inspection, these 
signposts are said to contain misleading information and to constitute visual obstruction. The signposts located near 
the beach, the main buildings, boilers and tanks include only purely factual information but the issue of dispersing 
the signs among ~he various areas of interest or appropriately concentrating them in one key place may be 
reviewed. 
More fundamentally and within the context of recently approved procedures to expand the role of the CEP in 
providing advice to the ATCM on issues pertaining to historic sites the issue of merging the three HMS (31,58 and 
71) into a single historic protected area could be raised. Whalers Bay could become the largest area for the 
preservation of historical values and, to this end, it is pertinent to remember the original language submitted by 
Chile and Norway to ATCM XIX (WP 21 Rev. 2): "a group of constructions, boats water, tanks, boilers and 
adjacent buildings, built by the people who lived and worked at Whalers Bay, Deception Insland, in the first third of 
the 20'h 
century" 
 
In addition to area protection, steps must be taken to prevent removal of valuable historical remains and Norway 
has proposed a system of automatic protection of these remains (WP 2O Rev. 1: Automatic Protection of Pre.1957 
Historic Remains). It is useful to remember that Chile seized a previous ATCM with a similar concern. Nevertheles 
a combination of information strategies, site inventories, guidelines and actions by qualified heritage associations is 
required to preserve Whalers Bay as the most significant remains of the only human settlement in the Continent of 
Antarctica during the early whaling period.

NoTE: This list reflects a survey made from the Chilean Base Pedro Aguirre Cerda before the destruction of the 
cemetery by the volcanic eruptions. It broadly agrees with a List 
provided by the Norwegian Polar Institute, nevertheless it starts the graveyards list on 22.01.1908, date of the fatal 
accident of Nokard Davidsen who inaugurated the cemetery on February that year, modifies some dates and fills 
some gaps, the most important being the addition of 9 of the ten members of the crew of whale-catcher Graham on 
6 November 1924. Doubts about nationality or age i are the subject of further comment in a historical note. 
BRIEF HISToRICAL NoTE ON THE CEMETERY AT WH~LERS BAY 
 
1. A graveyard for the whalers was established in Whalers Bay after the unfortunate death of No~ard 
Davidsen, Manager of the Newfoundland Whaling Company. The Newfoundland Whaling Company deployed 
factory ship Sabraon with whale catchers Puma and LvrL~c at the South orl;ney Islands during de surnmer 
19O7-O8. While whales were plentiful, catching was difficult due to ice conditions and the Newfoundland 
company proceeded to Deception Island, where it operated during the next two seasons. Davidsen fell 
overboard firom the Lynx and drowned, 22 Januarv 19O8. His funeral took place on 9 Februarv 19O8 and was 
attended by 2~O whalers deploying Nor~vegian, Chilean and British (for the Canadian company) flags. A 
column ~ feet high was erected and subsequently occupied the central position of the developing cemetery. The 
Newfoundland Whaling company was a local enterprise operating successfully from St. John's until 1925 but 
the catching equipment as well as the crews and most of the eYpedition managers, as was the case of Davidsen, 
were Norwegian. 
 
2. George odegaard was the second and the youngest of all the occupants of the cemetery. An oral tradition has 
survived regarding the letters he assiduously wrote to his mother, which friends undertook to continue to write 
during several years giving his mother the confort of believing that his son still survived in the remote Antarctic 
seas. 
 
3. Henrili Lagerstedt, the first of three Swedes identified among the graves in the cemetery (the other two being 
Axel Johnson and Herbert H0gberg) drowned and was brought from Dorian Bay, Port Lockroy. It is possible and 
requires further verification that some of the victims .of the whale-catcher Graham operating under the Swedish flag 
may have been nationals of that country although their names. suggest Norwegian nationality. 
 
4. Hans olsen seems to have perished when the whale-catcher Hafnen strucl; an iceberg and sunl; near the South 
Shetland Islands. 
 
. One graveyard remained unidentifiable since only the date of death was partially legible: lS.l9.19l~. 
 
6. Cayetano Nunoz drowed when the floating factory Tio~a (Sociedad Ballenera de Corral S.A.) was wrec~ed at 
Port Jebsen, Signy Island, after pioneering pelagic Antarctic whaling off the south orl;ney Islands. 
 
7. Sigurd Carlsen drowned off Danco coast, Antartic peninsula. 
 
S. Nielsel, Ss)rcnsen, Hansen and Antonisen died in various accidents during 1914 in the vicinity or Admiralty Bay, 
King George Island. 
9. Ma~ Slavoski is the only Russian buried in the whalers cemetery. He was l;illed, in un~;nown circunstances, 
together with his Norwegian friend, Karl o. Johansen. 
 
10. The identity of olav Kristiansen was established during the Chilean survey confirming his date of death but the 
causes are unknown. 
 
11. 
There are no clues to deaths which occurred from 1917 to 1922. Floating factory Solstreiff 
(Kapt. Thorstenden) was wrecked off Cape Melville, King George Island, but no casualties 
were reported and the ship was salvaged by a company from Punta Arenas (Comparlia 
Chilena de Salvatajes). 
 
12. Christensen, Gerd0e, Andressen and Samuelsen, the elder among the whalers buried in Deception Island, 
were killed when whale-catcher Bransfield, beloging to Hektor Whalling Co., capsized in Whalers Bay when 
assisting with transport of construction materials to expand the land base. Hansen died shortly after from wounds 
inflicted during the accident. 
 
13. Whale-catcher Graham (Kapt. Kristian Walbom Husvik) sunk near the South Shetland Islands on 6 November 
1924 and all ten men aboard were drowned. A tall column was erected in the cemetery to commemorate this 
tragedy and the ten manes were inscribed with their date of death: quite probably their bodies were not recuperated 
from the Antarctic sea ad the graveyard only perpetuated their memory; but data concerning their dates of birth or 
nationality were missing. When part of this research was presented in Madrid (Aulas Antarticas, Escuela 
Diplomatica Espanola, 1989: Presencia Humana en la Antartida!. Ambassador Rolf Andersen suggested that 
withoul prejudice to the Swedish flag flyed by the Graham the names of the ten men suggested Norwegian 
na~ionality which has been tentatively attibuted to them. Any help on this matter would be appreciated. 
 
1'1. Einar Mathiesen was remembered by a most original tomb. Through a tunnel of black marbre, a port-hole led to 
a small pilow symbolizing that his ship cabin had been his only home until the time that he became a permanent 
resident of the whalers cemetery. 
 
1~. A man was drowned when the vessel Professor Gruvel (Kapt. Bull) strucli an iceberg and sun~; near the South 
Shetland Islands, on IO'h October 1927. It might have been Carl Hansen but there is one month difference in the 
dates, unless the date on his grave had been that of his burial, and this is unlikely because the pattern has been to put 
the actual or assumed death date as well as the birth date when known at all, in a consistent manner. A more 
improbable identity would be that of Carl A. Hansen, skipper of the Southern Queen wrecked east of the South 
orl;ney's, 24 February 1928, after Hansen's death as apparently written on his grave. 
16. The cross erected by expedition staff of a cruise ship and placed nearby the hangar comrnemorates. T0mmer 
Hans Albert Gulliksen who was, after Niels Emst Samuelsen, the second oldest whaler buried in Deception Island. 
 
17. Langholt, Thorvaldsen and Torrison have question marks regarding their nationality in the Nor~vegian Polar 
Institute's List but we have attributed them the Norwegian nationality based on the fact that on Leif Thorvalsen's 
grave there was an inscription reading: Nar taken er svunden venter je~ ~lad. Min kjaere at favne I Himlens stad; 
and briefer sentences in Langholt and Torrison's graves. 
 
lS. We also attributed on a purely intuitive bases the Norwegian nationality ~o A.M.S. Begann. Although his date 
of birth had been wiped out by passage of time, the last two figures of the year remained -sugges~ing 1901- and 
therefore 28 years when he passed away. 
 
19. No major incidents seem to have caused the deaths occurring during the whaling seasons 192S-29, 1929-3O, 
and 193O-31 although in January 1931 a severe earthquake produced a descent of 4.6 m. in the floor of Port Foster. 
When the last whaler, Peter Knapstad, was buried in March 1931, the last whaling season in Deception Island was 
coming to its end. 
 
20. A British naval expedi~ion (operation Tabarin) established meteorological stations in several places, including 
Base B at Deception Island, in 1943. Ten years later, Arthur Farrant, a member of the Falkland Islands 
Dependencies Survey (FIDS) dies on 17.11.1953 and was buried in the cemetery at Whalers Bay.
