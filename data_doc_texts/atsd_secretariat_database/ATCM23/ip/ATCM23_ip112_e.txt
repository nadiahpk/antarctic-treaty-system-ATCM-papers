"Magic faerie of colours which sunshine created in its play with the endless snowy 
horizons. Ice sculptures carved by the hands of invisible enchantress. The unearthy 
landscape engulfs you in the greatness of nature. This magic reigns over one distant 
contincnt which reveals its secrets to these who dared with the cosmic cold and hurricane 
winds. Antarctica is a challenge to the human spirit, which aims not only to conquer and 
understand it, but also to preserve for the future generations the beauty covering one tenth 
of our planet." 
 
The copy of the book "Ice magic" will be available to each delegation of XXIII ATCM.
