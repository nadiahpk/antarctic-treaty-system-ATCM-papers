Chinese Scientific Antarctic Program Near Zhongshan Station 98/99 
 
 
The leading Chinese scientific Antarctic summer program based on Zhongshan Station 
and Xuelong vessel has been successful completed. All the projects commit to “The 
Scientific Research on Antarctica Responding and Feeding back to the Global Change”. 
A summary of phase 98/99 is as following: 
 
 
1.  Inland Traverse  
In 1996, CHINARE initiated traverse project from Zhongshan to Dome A for IATSE 
sectional program. The project in 1998-1999 season is the third time for field 
expedition. The Inland Traverse team consisted of 10 persons reached the point of 
(79°00’48”S, 77°00’04”E), which is 3750m above sea level and at a distance to 
Zhongshan 1076km, and has entered the region of Dome A.  
 
Scientific works were done as following. 
z DT (abbreviation of Dome A Traverse) is the serial number naming the pole of 
mass balance. The first DT001 point is succeeded LGB65 (named by Australian) 
southern 2km. 
z The poles for mass balance from DT085 to DT416 were set up in every 2km along 
the trip. 
z Series bed mapping by ice radar covering the 1000km course was surveyed, as well 
as the profiles of the ice cover layers.  
z A 100.6m ice-core at DT401(79°00’48” S,77°00’00”E) and a 82m ice-core at 
DT263 (76°32’18”S,77°01’48”E) were drilled. 
z A 3m deep snow pit at DT401, a 2.1m snow pit at DT364 and a 2.5m snow pit at 
DT263 were dug up. 
z Surface snow samples on each10km from LGB65 to DT416 were collected.  
 
 
2. Geological investigation in Grove Mountains region 
A field expedition team consisted of four persons has reached the region of Grove 
Mountains and worked there for 20 workdays. The basic geological knowledge of 
that area has been obtained. Based on the structural and metamorphic mapping on the 
nunataks exposed along about 500 km south from the Zhongshan Station, some 
tectonic framework has been established. During the field investigation, the 
sedimentary rocks and meteorite samples were found.

3. Hydrological survey near Prydz Bay    
On this voyage hydrological observation and sampling as far as the sea-bed at all 
sites, especially at the deep sea region, have been conducted for the sake of getting the 
complete set of data to study the formation of the water mass, circulation current and 
cycle of bio-geochemistry. An instrument of sediment traps has been released (Sino-
US cooperation item) at the north of Prydz Bay. The XBT and XCTD have been 
operated on the set profiles and the data of the environmental change of the sea were 
obtained.  
 
 
 
The programs of this voyage as following: 
1) A study of water mass of continental frame and the formation and 
transportation of Antarctic bottom water. 
2) A study of the feature of circle current at Prydz Bay and near by. 
3) A study of Antarctic sea-ice activity and its effect on the exchange from sea to 
air. 
4) A study of geochemistry for the trace elements of Antarctic water mass. 
5) A study of bio-geochemistry carbon cycle of at Prydz Bay and near by. 
6) A study on dynamics of the key species of zooplankton at southern Ocean and 
their relations with the environment  
7) Study on primary production and new productive force. 
8) Study on distribution and variation of nutrition at Prydz Bay and nearby.
