OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM 
 
 
 
Under the agenda item “Operation of the Antarctic Treaty System” it is important for 
Parties to the Antarctic Treaty to take stock of the present realities confronting 
Members of the Treaty System. 
 
New Zealand is concerned that the system is not effectively responding to two specific 
challenges:  the illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries activities in the Antarctic 
Treaty area for Patagonian toothfish (also known as black hake or Chilean sea bass), 
and the failure despite some years of intensive discussions for the Treaty Parties to 
finalise and adopt an effective liability regime in accordance with Article 16 of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
New Zealand proposes that ATCM XXIII consider and adopt the two draft decisions 
contained in this paper. 
 
 
IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE IX 1(f):  TOOTHFISH 
 
The Antarctic Treaty Parties agreed to a joint obligation in Article IX 1(f) of the 
Antarctic Treaty to take measures regarding 
 
preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica 
 
In adopting the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR), the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties at the time, devolved to the 
CCAMLR Commission the responsibility for carrying out their obligation in Article IX 
1(f) of the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
The objective of CCAMLR, expressed in Article II was  
 
the conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
 
Furthermore the CCAMLR Contracting Parties - who were largely the Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Parties at the time - specifically recognised in the Convention text the  
 
prime responsibilities of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties for the protection and 
preservation of the Antarctic environment and, in particular, their responsibilities under 
Article IX, paragraph 1(f) of the Antarctic Treaty in respect of the preservation and 
conservation of living resources in Antarctica. 
 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have an obligation to take effective conservation 
measures in respect of Patagonian toothfish stocks in the Southern Ocean. 
1 
 
 
 
A failure by the CCAMLR Commission to take effective measures to halt illegal, 
unregulated and unreported fisheries activities for these stocks is a serious failure on the 
part of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in implementation of Article IX 1(f) of 
the Antarctic Treaty.   
 
Antarctic Treaty Parties each have an obligation to take a national position on this issue 
which represents the combined security, environmental and fisheries interests involved. 
 
If permitted to continue, the failure to take effective measures, has the potential to 
impact seriously on the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
 
 
LIABILITY ANNEX TO PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY 
 
Article 16 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection reflects the clear obligation on 
the Treaty Parties to elaborate rules and procedures relating to liability for damage 
arising from activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty Area. 
 
For so long as there remains an absence of agreed rules concerning liability, a legal 
lacuna exists which may otherwise be sought to be filled by the extension of national 
jurisdiction, or through bilateral or regional arrangements. 
 
Antarctic Treaty Parties need to agree on a timeframe in which to finalise and adopt a 
Liability Annex to the Protocol on Environmental Protection as obliged in Article 16.  
New Zealand proposes that the Antarctic Treaty Parties commit themselves to 
finalisation and adoption of a text by the fortieth anniversary of the entry into force of 
the Antarctic Treaty in 2001.

Draft ATCM XXIII Decisions 
 
 
 
Implementation of Article IX 1(f):  Toothfish 
 
 
The Representatives 
 
Conscious of the importance of maintaining the Antarctic Treaty System and in 
particular the significance of Article IV concerning Rights and Claims 
 
Recalling the obligation in Article IX 1(f) to take measures regarding the preservation 
and conservation of living resources in Antarctica 
 
Bearing in mind the concern regarding the conservation of Antarctic marine living 
resources expressed by the Consultative Parties at the Ninth Consultative Meeting of 
the Antarctic Treaty which led to the establishment of the Convention on the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
 
Conscious of the need for urgent and effective measures to be adopted by the CCAMLR 
Commission concerning conservation and management of Patagonian toothfish stocks 
in the Southern Ocean 
 
Decide: 
 
To invite the CCAMLR Commission, at its XVIII meeting in Hobart, 1999, to adopt 
effective measures to conserve stocks of Patagonian toothfish, and in particular to adopt 
a trade certification scheme, and thereafter to consider further measures reflecting the 
obligation each Contracting Party has pursuant to Article XXI of the Convention, to 
take appropriate measures within its competence to ensure compliance with the 
provisions of the Convention and with conservation measures adopted by the 
Commission to which the Party is bound.
