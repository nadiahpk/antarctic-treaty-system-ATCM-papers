An Assessment of Environmental Emergencies Arising from 
Activities in Antarctica 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
1.  
Resolution 6 of ACTM XXII requested that COMNAP undertake an assessment of the risks 
of environmental emergencies arising from activities in Antarctica, including but not limited to an 
analysis of incidents which have occurred over the past ten years within the Antarctic Treaty area, 
and the types of future incidents that could occur in connection with operations at stations and bases.  
The Resolution also requested that the assessment concentrate on facts, data and evaluations, with 
regard to circumstances leading to and types of environmental damage, the financial magnitude of 
potential damages and the probable costs of response actions and remedial measures under the 
circumstances of Antarctica.  This working paper summarises the data collected from national 
operators in response to the attached questionnaire.  
 
 
SURVEY RESULTS 
 
2.  
Seventeen out of the 29 COMNAP members responded to the survey.  Of the 17 
respondents, 6 countries reported no incidents.  The remainder reported 117 incidents over the past 
ten years (1988-1998) which had the potential to result in adverse environmental effects or require 
an emergency response.  There was some variation in reporting by the various countries.  For 
example, one program reported medical emergencies requiring evacuations as a reportable incident, 
while other programs did not consider such incidents reportable.  Because these reported medical 
evacuations did not result in any environmental impact, and the remaining programs did not report 
their medical evacuations, no further discussion of these type of incidents are included in the report.  
 
3. 
Some programs reported all fuel spills, regardless of volume, while other programs reported 
only those spills in excess of 200 liters (COMNAP Guidelines for the Reporting of Oil Spill 
Incidents generally require national Antarctic operators to report fuel spills in excess of 200 liters).  
Some national programs included fires in their incident reports while others did not.  Even with these 
minor reporting discrepancies, we believe that it provides a useful overview of the incidents that 
have occurred in the course of operating national programs over the last ten years and can be 
considered representative of the experience of all national programs. 
   
4. 
The reported incidents can be divided into three major categories (excluding medical 
emergencies referred to above) as noted in Figure 1:  
 
• 
Liquid Spills (Primarily Petroleum Products)   
• 
Transport accidents involving aircraft, motor vehicles, and vessels  
• 
Fires

5.  
In 114 out of the 117 incidents reported there were no injuries to Antarctica fauna or flora.  
Only one incident, a marine fuel spill in 1989, resulted in documented adverse impact on wildlife.  
Two other marine fuel spills involving smaller volumes than the 1989 incident resulted in no 
observed injuries to wildlife.   
 
6. 
The most common type of incident involves liquid spills, which comprise 79 out of the 117 
incidents (see Figure 2).  Seventy-three of the 79 liquid spills were petroleum products; three 
involved spills of chemical reagents and three were glycol (antifreeze agent) spills.  Of these 79 
spills, 57 were volumes of less than 1,000 liters (18 of which were less than 200 liters), 14 involved 
volumes between 1,000 and 10,000 liters, seven between 10,000 and 100,000 liters, and one spill in 
excess of 100,000 liters.  Fifty-nine of these spills occurred on land, 12 on ice sheets, five on sea ice 
and three directly into the marine environment (see Figure 3 over-page).

7. 
The second most frequent type of incident were transportation-related accidents (20 cases), 
nine of which involved aircraft, one involved a small boat, and the remaining ten involved ground 
vehicles.  In half of the cases it was possible to remove the damaged vehicle/aircraft from the site of 
the accident.  In the remaining half, the vehicles/aircraft were irretrievable.  
 
8. 
The third most frequent type of incident is fire.  Fourteen fire incidents were reported - all 
but one occurred at permanent stations.  Several of the fire incidents were accidental releases of fire 
extinguishing agents (predominantly halon) with no actual fire.  In most cases, fire-damaged 
equipment or buildings were removed.   
 
9. 
While some data was provided by national operators on the cost of response action, it was 
not possible to segregate the costs of damage to facilities or equipment, response action and 
remediation or to provide accurate estimates.  Nevertheless, the estimated cost of response and 
remediation for each incident was generally reported to be under US$30,000 (with the exception of 
the Bahai Parraiso incident where the total cost was substantial but not quantified). 
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
10. 
Approximately 75% of reported spill incidents occurred on land (ice-free areas) as noted in 
Figure 4 (over-page).  Programs reported that they were generally able to take timely response 
actions to these spills, resulting in effective steps to minimize the migration of the spill and clean up 
the contaminated area.  Research studies in the Arctic and Antarctic have demonstrated that diesel 
fuels will penetrate the upper soil layer, but will not penetrate down through ice-rich permafrost 
which can act as an effective barrier to fuel movement.  If the spill reaches the interface between the 
soil layer and the permafrost, it may begin to migrate laterally or down-gradient.1,2 In many cases, 
programs were able to recover the contaminated surface layers of soil and backfill the hole with 
clean soil.  In some cases, it was not feasible to excavate remaining contaminated soil without more 
extensive excavation in the permafrost, which could have resulted in a greater environmental impact

than allowing the contaminant to remain in situ.  Wildlife was not present at these sites.  For these 
reasons, none of these terrestrial spills resulted in injury to wildlife or any anticipated adverse impact 
over time. 
 
 
11. 
Approximately fifteen percent of the reported spills occurred on the ice sheet.  Spills 
typically percolate rapidly through the compacted snow surface (firn), migrate laterally along ice 
layers, and may accumulate above the impermeable ice (30 to 120 meters below the surface 
depending on the location).  On ice shelves, studies have shown that such spills percolate almost 
straight down with little lateral dispersion until the spill reaches the ice firm layer or the water layer 
below.  If the ice sheet is grounded, the spill may move laterally.3 It is not technically feasible to 
recover such fuel without major excavations that could cause greater environmental impact than 
allowing it to remain in place.  Since there is no wildlife or flora present in those areas, and because 
the volume of spills in most cases is relatively small, the spills remain localized and are not 
considered to pose a significant risk to the environment.  
 
12. 
Spills onto sea ice comprise approximately six percent of the total number of reported spill 
incidents.  In some cases it has been possible to absorb spilled fuel from the sea ice surface using 
absorbent materials before it migrates into the water column.  Once the spilled material reaches the 
water, it is very difficult to recover because it rapidly disperses or evaporates.  If the spill reaches the 
water, the potential environmental impacts will vary depending on the quantities spilled, the 
movement of the spill under the ice, and the presence of wildlife in the affected area. 
 
13.  
Three marine spills have been reported over the past ten years (4% of reported spills), 
suggesting that marine fuel spills occur infrequently.  Marine spills that occur in the proximity of 
breeding grounds, rookeries, or significant habitats for a particular species, pose a greater risk to the 
environment than marine spills that occur at a distance from these more sensitive sites.  
 
14.  
The largest marine spill on record arose when the Bahia Parraiso ran aground off Anvers 
Island in the Antarctic Peninsula in 1989 when 600,000 litres of fuel began to leak from the hull.  
Immediately after the incident, Argentine and U.S. response teams recovered over 65,000 litres of 
fuel from the ship. Within the first week, much of the spilled fuel had dissipated by evaporation and 
dispersion, reducing the effectiveness of further clean-up efforts.  Two years after the incident, 
Argentina and Netherlands carried out a joint fuel recovery effort to pump out the remaining 
148,500 liters of fuel trapped within the tanks of the ship.   
 
15.  
Shortly after the incident, an international interdisciplinary team of scientists began 
assessing the long-term impacts of the spill on the local marine ecosystem.  According to those 
studies, the affected area consisted of islands that were breeding sites for species of seabirds and a 
principal habitat for seals.  It took seven years of marine ecosystem studies to distinguish between 
the environmental impact arising from the spill and the natural variability in species population 
dynamics.  Initially, the spill affected nearly all species in the immediate vicinity.  Seven years after 
the spill, the majority of species had recovered to pre-spill levels while two species continue to 
demonstrate reduced viability - cormorants and kelp gulls.4  The other two smaller marine spills 
reported in the survey resulted in no observed injuries to wildlife.

16.  
In examining all of the spill reports included in this survey (Figure 5), approximately 52% 
were caused by human error (e.g. overfilling tanks, incorrect valve sequences) and 48% were due to 
mechanical failure (e.g. gasket leaks, fuel bladder leaks, hose failures).  It is believed that 
implementation of the “COMNAP Recommended Procedures for Fuel Oil Transfer at Stations and 
Bases”, “COMNAP Recommendations for Spill Prevention” and the “Containment of Fuel Oil at 
Stations and Bases” would have either, prevented many of these spills from occurring, or reduced 
the size of the spill.  The COMNAP Guidelines were developed in 1992 and gradually implemented 
across national programs in subsequent years.  The gradual diminution in the number of reported 
incidents per year since 1992-1994 time period suggests that these recommendations are being 
implemented and are effective. (Figure 6).  COMNAP recommended the reporting and tracking of 
spills in 1992; prior to that time many national programs had not implemented any such spill 
tracking system so that some spills occurring prior to 1992 may not be reported in the survey.

In the transport accidents reported, the only release to the environment was from the 
vehicle’s leaking fuel tanks or engines, typically involving small quantities of petroleum products.  
In addition, several aircraft and vehicles could not be recovered because they fell into a crevasse or 
sunk to the sea floor.  No impacts on the local environment were noted in any of these incidents.

Potential environmental impacts from fires include atmospheric releases of smoke and fire 
extinguishing materials.  Atmospheric releases during these fires were considered insignificant 
because they involve the combustion of structural materials (e.g. wood) or fuel.  Ambient air quality 
monitoring at several Antarctic stations have indicated that local air quality in the vicinity of these 
stations is not impacted significantly by normal station operations.  It is believed that the incremental 
increase from such fires to the normal air emission inventory is insignificant.  No impacts on the 
local environment were noted in any of these incidents.  Although fires may pose a significant 
human safety risk, the absence of trees or other combustible vegetation in Antarctica eliminates the 
possibility of a fire spreading beyond buildings in the immediate vicinity of the station.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING OF IMPACTS 
 
19. 
COMNAP and SCAR are currently developing a Monitoring Handbook that will provide 
guidance to national program managers in selecting parameters and methodologies for monitoring 
impacts from operational activities, including accidental spills with adverse effects on the 
environment.  The Handbook is being developed on the basis of the joint environmental monitoring 
workshops conducted by COMNAP/SCAR during the last few years.  As each national operator 
develops such monitoring programs it will enhance COMNAP’s ability to evaluate the 
environmental impacts resulting from incidents in the future. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
20. 
Based on the results of the survey it is concluded that: 
 
• 
there are minimal adverse environmental impacts resulting from ground or air transport 
incidents or fires (These events appear to occur infrequently and when they do the magnitude of 
their impact on the environment is insignificant); 
 
• 
the most common incidents with the potential to cause the greatest environment impacts are 
fuel spills; 
 
• 
most fuel spills in Antarctica are likely to be small and confined to a station or base or the 
adjoining waters and are unlikely to threaten wildlife; 
 
• 
fuel spills in the marine environment have a low probability of occurrence but pose a greater 
magnitude of risk to wildlife than terrestrial or ice sheet spills  (Clearly, marine spills in the 
vicinity of rookeries, breeding grounds or primary habitats for marine mammals or birds pose a 
higher risk than marine spills in open sea or less sensitive areas); and 
 
• 
because fuel spills have greatest potential to cause environmental impacts, spill prevention 
strategies are the most effective tool to minimize potential environmental impacts, followed by 
emergency preparedness and spill response. 
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
21. 
It is recommended that: 
 
• 
Consultative Parties ensure that their national Antarctic agencies implement the COMNAP 
guidelines on fuel transfer, fuel spill prevention and containment, and emergency response 
action and contingency planning as required by ATCM XXII Resolution 6 (1998). 
 
• 
national operators ensure that all fuel handling and storage equipment are maintained in good 
order and that spill response exercises are held on a regular basis.  (These measures will 
significantly reduce the frequency and magnitude of liquid spills, and thereby minimize 
environmental impacts); and 
 
• 
COMNAP continues collecting and collating data annually from all the national programs on 
incidents with potential adverse effects on the environment arising from national program 
activities so that COMNAP can periodically reassess the guidelines and revise as necessary, as 
recommended in Resolution 6 (1998).  COMNAP suggests that the ATCM seek comparable 
information from non-governmental organizations operating in Antarctica so that a more 
comprehensive database may be assembled

COMNAP SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE 
 
 
 
 
 
TO: All COMNAP & SCALOP Members  
 
MNAP NOTICE 175: QUESTIONNAIRE ON ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS  
 
With reference to COMNAP decision in Concepcion (Item 10.3 of the Report), members are requested to 
report by 21 SEPTEMBER 1998 on environmental hazards that have occurred in Antarctic operations during 
the last ten years (1987/88 - 1997/98).  
 
Please fill the questionnaire separately for each case, both for incidents that actually occurred and for "near-
miss" situations. As indicated by ATCM Decision 3, the purpose is to assess the real risks, therefore, statistics 
on both occurred events as well as potential accidents should be provided.  
 
The purpose of the analysis will be to report to ATCM on types, frequencies and magnitudes (both in 
environmental and economic terms) of the environmental risks from accidents in the conduct of national 
activities. Therefore, although detailed information on dates are requested, this information will only serve to 
be able to produce statistical summaries for the report. All information will be treated confidentially.  
 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE ATCM TO ASSIST IN 
DELIBERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED LIABILITY ANNEX. YOUR INUT IS 
THEREFORE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE.  
 
In case you have uncertainties on reporting to the Working Group, please contact either Pentti Mälkki or Jack 
Sayers.  
 
 
*******************************************************  
 
ACTION: Please complete the following questionnaire for all incidents (actual and near-misses) that have 
occurred during the last 10 years during in conduct of national activities and return to Pentti Malki and Jack 
Sayers by 21 SEPTEMBER 1998. Use one form for each incident. (The questionnaire has also been attached 
as a Word document so that responses can be forwarded by fax or mail, if desired)
