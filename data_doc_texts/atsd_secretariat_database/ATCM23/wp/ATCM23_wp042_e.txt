ENVIRoNMENTAL DAMAGE 
 
The Representatives, 
 
Recalling Resolution 6 (1998) regarding Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning; 
 
Recording the gratitude of the Meeting for the valuable information regarding risks to the Antarctic 
environment contained in XXII ATCM / WP / 6 presented by CoMNAP, and for the participation of 
CoMNAP and SCAR at the present Meeting during discussion of the question of liability for 
environmental damage; 
 
Request that CoMNAP and SCAR: 
 
1. Continue to provide representatives throughout all meetings of the Consultative Parties at which the 
question of liability is discussed. 
 
2. Provide, not later than... April 20OO, Working Papers for XXIV ATCM containing detailed answers 
with examples to the following questions: 
 
(a) What criteria can be used to determine whether a harmful effect on the Antarctic environment 
("damage") is "significant"? 
 
(b) What do you understand by the reference in Article 16 of the Environmental Protocol to the phrase 
"dependent and associated ecosystems"? 
 
(c) What, in the circumstances of Antarctica, could be said to be an "accident" causing "environmental 
damage" or an "environmental emergency"? 
 
(d) In what circumstances would it be possible, practicable and desirable to take action to contain, 
mitigate or clean-up damage, or to reinstate the environment? 
 
(e) In what circumstances might damage be described as "irreparable", and at what point in time could one 
determine it? 
 
(f) When damage is "irreparable", and prevents a science project from continuing, 
should the body conducting the project be compensated for wasted expenditure?
