BASIC DEFINITIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
THE ANNEX ON THE LIABILITY REGIME 
 
 
 
The Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty acknowledge the need to establish 
general guidelines for formulating a regime on liability for damage to the Antarctic 
environment, to be presented at ATCM XXIII. 
 
 
Such a regime should seek to preserve and protect the Antarctic environment 
through procedures that, although geared mainly towards environmental protection, also 
allow for appropriate compensatory mechanisms. 
 
 
The regime also needs to take account of the fact that protection of the Antarctic 
environment is not covered explicitly by existing international instruments. That 
notwithstanding, these instruments need to be borne in mind when setting up such a 
regime. 
 
 
In this connection, the following basic definitions and principles have been 
identified as a guideline for the prospective liability annex: 
 
 Damage: any adverse impact having a significant and lasting effect on the 
Antarctic environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems as 
produced by an activity performed in the area of the Antarctic Treaty. For 
purposes of this definition, the term Αdamage≅ does not include those impacts 
that have been evaluated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 
8 of the Protocol and Annex 1 thereto. 
 
 Operator: any State or any individual or public or private legal entity directly 
authorized by or associated with same. 
 
 Liability: the general principle is that of strict liability. 
 
 Extenuating circumstances: act of God, force majeure, dire necessity, extreme 
danger, armed conflict, act of terrorism, and the emergency situations provided 
for in the annexes. 
 
 Activities especially considered: the liability regime should include special 
consideration for scientific activities and their related logistics. 
 
 Preventative measures, response actions, remedial measures, and restorative 
measures: these shall be the responsibility of the operator and are viewed 
within a framework of cooperation; they should be geared primarily towards 
the objective of environmental protection. 
 
 Omission or inability of the operator to perform: in the event the operator or its 
 State does not take such action, the State shall request cooperation from third 
parties or shall give its consent for third parties to take such action 
 
 
2
 Responsibility to reimburse costs incurred: any operator that is responsible for 
damage shall reimburse the reasonable costs that have been incurred by a third 
party authorized by the State. 
 
 Residual liability of the State of the operator: in the event the operator does not 
reimburse costs incurred by a third party, said costs shall be reimbursed by the 
State of the operator, if the latter has acted without due diligence. 
 
 Dispute resolution: preference should be given to alternative (i.e., non 
jurisdictional) mechanisms, including the System's own institutional 
arrangements, such as the CEP, ATCM and any such other mechanism as may 
be appropriate.
