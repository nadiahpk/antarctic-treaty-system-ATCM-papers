AVAILABILITY TO THE PUBLIC OF
CONFERENCE DOCUMENTS
(Working Paper Submitted by
the U.S. Delegation)

Public interest in Antarctica is growing, fuelled by concern
for the environment and questions relating to possible resource
activity. Governments outside the Treaty regime are evidencing
increasing interest in the activities of Treaty parties, particu-
larly within the Consultative forum. There is relatively little
information publicly available, and in its absence suspicion and
misinterpretation may occur.

If the Consultative Parties are to maintain their leadership
in Antarctic matters, they must be more forthcoming than heretofore.
Evidence of their deliberations at Consultative Meetings, up to now
largely out of reach of the public, should be made more readily
available. To this end, it is proposed that the Ninth Consultative
Meeting and future meetings determine at the end of the meetings
which conference documents should be considered privileged and
afforded confidentiality. All documents not so designated would be
considered releasable to the public.

One way to accomplish this would be to propose that the Ninth
Consultative Meeting amend the Rules of Procedure with the addition
of a new Section, numbered 25 and entitled "Documents of the
Meeting", as follows:

"Any Delegation submitting a document to a Consultative or
preparatory meeting may request such document be afforded confidential
treatment and the other Consultative Parties shall accord said docu-
ment such treatment.

Any other document of the meeting will be available to the
public at the conclusion of the Meeting unless there is consensus
to the contrary."
