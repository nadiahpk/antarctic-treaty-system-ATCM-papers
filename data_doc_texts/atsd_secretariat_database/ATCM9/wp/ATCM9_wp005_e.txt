Provisional Agenda Item 7

Summary of the views so far expressed on the Guidelines for the Meeting of Experts

The following appear:s to represent the consensus reached in discussions so far, although some countries have not yet expressed a view.

1. There is agreement that the Guidelines set out in ANT/EPM/12 adequately describe the main subject areas to be discussed by the experts and may be tal n by governments as a guide when considering the selection of relevant experts. In this connection it has been suggested that examination of these subject areas would benefit from contributions from administrative and/or managerial experts in order to facilitate subsequent consideration of protective measures by the consultative parties.

2. It is accepted that the Guidelines are open to amendment by the experts if necessary, and in addition two amendments have been proposed;

(a) that a new sub-paragraph (i) should be added to the Guidelines as follows:

"(i) techniques to assess the present state of the Antarctic environment and to monitor changes which may occur as the result of mineral explo ation and exploitation, if such activities were to occur."
( i ) that the Guid( !ines be amended to include the notion that 
the experts should "examine and report on" the subjects 
listed, since this was the wording used in paragrap!; 19 of 
the report of the Special Preparatory Meeting in Paris in 
1976.  Thus the text of the second paragraph of the Guide-
lines would read:-

"..... this meeting should examine and report on the 
following topics, with special reference to ......"
