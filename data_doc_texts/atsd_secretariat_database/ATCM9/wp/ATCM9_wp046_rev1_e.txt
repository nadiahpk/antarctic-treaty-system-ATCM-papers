Agenda Item 10

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT:
OIL CONTAMINATION

(Draft Recommendation submitted by Argentina and the United Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.   They prepare reports concerning the pathways by which oil
     reaches the Antarctic marine environment as a result of
     man's maritime activities in the Antarctic;

2.   They include in these reports proposals relating to
     practicable means, if any, by which such oil contamination
     might be reduced by the adoption of higher standards
     of ship operation than those required by the relevant
     IMCO Conventions;

3.   They consider the possibility of instituting a programme
     for the determination of baseline levels of contamination
     of the Antarctic marine environment by oil;

4.   They provide their reports to, and further consider this
     matter at, the Meeting of Experts recommended in paragraphs
     2 and 3 of Recommendation IX-, with a view to making
     proposals concerning these matters for consideration at
     the next Consultative Meeting.
