CONSIDERING that Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty provides that the 
Contracting Parties shall meet at suitable intervals for the purposes 
prescribed in that Article,

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS that, from the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting onwards, they should consider the possibility of agreeing that the meetings 
should be held annually.
