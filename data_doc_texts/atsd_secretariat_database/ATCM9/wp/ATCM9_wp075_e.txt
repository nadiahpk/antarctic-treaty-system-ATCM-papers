Agenda Item 13

Document presented by the Delegation of Chile

PROPOSED RECOMMENDATION OF A SITE OF SPECIAL
MARINE SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

The Representatives:

    Recalling Articles II and IX of the Antarctic Treaty and
Recommendation VIII-10 relating to the marine living resources
of Antarctica;

    Recognizing the need to carry out scientific investigations
into marine resources and to protect them for an adequate period
from any kind of interference;

    Recommend to their Governments that the following should be
considered as Sites of Special Scientific Interest:

    Site No.  (Bahia South - Doumer Island).  This is located
between the S.E. extremity of Anvers Island and the S.W. tip
of Wiencke Island.  Bahia South is situated to the S.W. of
Doumer Island at latitude 64° 52' 24" S and longitude
63° 36' 00" W.

    Management Plan:

1.  Description of site:  the entire bay and the adjoining
coast.

2.  Reasons for designation:  investigations into the food chains
of marine organisms have been in progress in the Bay for the past
three years, and the results suggest that the work should be
pursued.  These investigations include studies of interrelation-
ships such as the competition and predatory habits of different
species of fish and the invertebrates which provide their diet.
These scientific activities include diving operations and
underwater photography, so that the passage of shipping through

/this
this area is inadvisable owing to the interference which 
would result.

3.  Date of termination of the designation: 30th June, 1982.

4.  Access points:  To the W of Peltier Channel.

5.  Routes:  Gerlache Strait via Bismarck Strait.

6.  Exclusion of other kinds of investigation which cause 
interference.  It is recommended that no investigations of 
marine deposits, or such as require samples of rock from the 
sea-bed, should be carried out.

7.  Sampling:  Sampling of fish and benthonic fauna will be 
limited in accordance with the Agreed Measures for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna.

8.  Other restrictions:  The discharge of fuel tank residues 
and the dumping of waste generated by man should be avoided.

Site No.    Foster Bay, Deception Island.

Management Plan:

1.  Description of site:  the entire bay and the adjoining 
coast;  latitude 62° 59' 44" S, longitude 60° 33' 57" W.

2.  Reason for designation as a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest:  The recent volcanic eruptions have resulted in the 
partial extinction of the benthonic fauna within the bay. 
Since that time, slow recolonization has been in progress. 
Over the last 6 years this process has been the subject of study, 
and this seems to be one of the few cases where data of this 
nature relating to the Antarctic ecosystem are available.

3.  Termination date:  30th June, 1982.

4.  Access points:  The S.E. opening at 'Neptune's Bellows'.

5.  Route.  Bransfield Strait.

6.  Exclusion of other investigations.  Any other investigation 
which would interfere with the natural process of recolonization.

7.  Sampling:  Sampling of fish and benthonic fauna will be 
limited in accordance with the provisions of the Agreed Measures 
for the Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna.
