Agenda Item 6

ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES

(Chairman's suggested basis for Discussion)

Recommend to the Governments that:

1. A definitive regime for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources be negotiated and agreed before the end of
1978.

2. A special meeting of Consultative Parties be convened
at                                                             :

(a) to determine the form of the definitive regime, including
the question as to whether a wider international instrument
such as a convention is necessary;

(b) to establish the rules of procedure for a subsequent
decisive meeting for the establishment of the definitive
regime, including the question of participation by states
other than Consultative Parties which are actively
engaged in research or exploitation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources and the question of participation, on an
observer basis, of appropriate international organisations;

(c) to finalise the date and place of the decisive meeting to
be held in 1978, if possible at
on                                                            ;

(d) to carry out the necessary preparatory work for such a
meeting, including the elaboration of a draft legal
instrument.

3. The special meeting of Consultative Parties should base its
work on this recommendation and, in the elaboration of a draft
legal instrument, should include the following elements

/ - the regime
- the regime should explicitly recognise the prime responsibilities of the Consultative Parties in relation to the protection and conservation of the Antarctic environment and the importance of the measures recommended by the Consultative Parties to this end

- the regime should ensure that the balance secured by virtue of Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty is safeguarded in its application to the seas in which the regime applies

- the area to be covered by the regime should be based principally on the area of specific competence of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, i.e. the area south of sixty degrees south latitude

- the regime should provide for the effective conservation of all marine living organisms throughout the Antarctic ecosystem as a whole and should provide for the possibility of its extension beyond the limit of sixty degrees south where that is necessary for the effective conservation of various species within the ecosystem

- the regime should not directly apply to species already regulated pursuant to existing international agreements but should take into account the relationship of such species to the Antarctic ecosystem as a whole.

(These elements are without prejudice to any further elements which might be agreed and subsequently included.)
