DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON SUPPORT FOR              
THE BIOMASS PROGRAMME              

The Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting,              

Considering the urgent need to acquire a deeper understanding              
of the structure and dynamic functioning of the Antarctic marine              
ecosystem;              

Considering that any rational management of the potential              
marine living resources of the Antarctic Ocean must be based on              
accurate and thorough scientific knowledge;              

Considering that such scientific knowledge is an essential              
prerequisite to the implementation of any future international              
convention on the conservation of the Antarctic marine ecosystem;              

Recommends all the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic              
Treaty to support the BIOMASS programme prepared by the SCAR/SCOR              
group of specialists on the living resources of the Antarctic              
Ocean;              

Recommends that such support be provided in the form of              
adequate facilities (ships, personnel, finance) for research              
institutions and/or agencies specializing in biological              
oceanographic research in Antarctica to enable such institutions              
and/or agencies to take an active part in preparing for and              
carrying out the international multidisciplinary FIBEX and SIBEX              
programmes planned for 1980 and 1983;              

Recommends that the BIOMASS programme be coordinated as              
suggested in ANT/IX/10 i.e:              

1. By a SCAR/SCOR scientific planning group, possibly the              
existing group of specialists with enlarged membership;
2. By a BIOMASS coordinating group, a sub-group of the 
existing IOC International Coordinating Group for the 
Southern Ocean.  This coordinating group would be 
expected to call on the services of SCAR, SCOR, IABO, 
FAO and IWC;

3. By the appointment of an International Co-ordinator.
