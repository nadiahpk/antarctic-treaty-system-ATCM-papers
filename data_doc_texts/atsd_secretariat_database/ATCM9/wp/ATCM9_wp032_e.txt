ACTIVITIES IN THE ANTARCTIC OF STATES THAT ARE NOT
CONTRACTING PARTIES

(Draft Recommendation submitted by the Delegation of Chile)

The Representatives

Considering the question of possible substantial
or continuing activities in the Antarctic Area by States that are not Contracting Parties
to the Treaty,

Recalling the principles and purposes of the Treaty,
in particular that the Antarctic Treaty Area should
continue to be a zone of peace and scientific
cooperation and should not become the scene or
object of international discord.,

Acknowledging that the primary responsibility for
Antarctic matters, including the protection of the
environment, lies with the States active in the area
which are Parties in the Antarctic Treaty.

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They consult together as provided for by the Treaty
and consider means to urge or invite the State or
states concerned to accede to the Treaty, pointing
out the rights and benefits they would receive and
also the responsabilities and obligations of Contracting
Parties.

2. They urge the States that may become Parties to the
Antarctic Treaty to contemplate approving the Recom-
mendations adopted at Consultative Meetings in pursuance
of the Treaty and subsequently approved by all the
Consultative Parties whose representatives were en-
titled to participate in the meetings held to consider
those measures.
3. They further call the attention of those States 
to the procedure agreed by the West C?nsultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty to 
implement article IV, paragraph 2 of the Antarctic 
Treaty.
