SOME IDEAS ON THE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE           
WORKING GROUP ON TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF EXPLORATION           
AND EXPLOITATION OF MINERALS           

Submitted by the Argentine Delegation.           

The Working Group has, as general terms of reference, the           
task of examining and reporting on the basis of the available           
documents (viz : Special Preparatory Meeting Final Report of Paris,           
Report of Specialists Group EAMREA of Dallas, and documents pro-           
duced by the Extended Preparatory Meetings).           

It is suggested that besides identifying problems and exchang-           
ing viewpoints on exploration and exploitation techniques and on           
prevention and restoration techniques for the environment, the           
Working Group should list its conclusions to the plenary, accord-           
ing, among others, to the following directions:           

- present state of exploration and exploitation techniques,           
and of the eventual impact of such exploration and exploitation           
on the environment, as well as of the known measures for preven-           
tion and restoration of the environment;           

- items and aspects requiring further studies and collection           
of information and data;           

- preliminary guidelines on the prevention of damages inflicted           
to the environment and its restoration which could be completed           
later on;           

- positive and negative aspects of eventual activities of           
exploration and exploitation, from an economic and scientific           
standpoint.
