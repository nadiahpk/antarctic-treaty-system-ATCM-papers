ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES :

The Representatives,                   
                   
Recalling Recommendation VIII - 10;                   
                   
Aware of the inadequacy of the information concerning the                   
biology, distribution, bio-mass, population dynamics and the ecology                   
of Antarctic marine living resources;                   
                   
Recognizing the need to develop a good scientific foundation for                   
appropriate conservation measures;                   
                   
Noting with appreciation the response of the Scientific Committee                   
on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to Recommendation VIII - 10 and the                   
preparation by the SCAR/SCOR Group of Specialists on Living Resources                   
(SCOR) Working Group 54) of the Biological Investigation of Marine                   
Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS) programme;                   
                   
And Noting the valuable contributions to the BIOMASS programme that                   
can be made by any vessel operating in the Antarctic.                   
                   
Recommend to their Governments that:                   
                   
1. They initiate or expand, insofar as is practicable within their                   
Antarctic scientific programmes, detailed studies that will                   
contribute to the practical implementation of the BIOMASS                   
research programme;                  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  




2. They undertake, in planning their marine activities in the
Antarctic;

(a) to have regard to the advantages that will accrue from
coordination of scientific investigations;

(b) to make available on vessels operating in the Antarctic, other than research vessels contributing directly to the
BIOMASS programme, time and facilities for routine
observations aimed at extending the data base for the
programme;

(c) to have regard to the scientific advantages that will
accrue from integrating, insofar as is practicable,
research vessel programmes with commercial fishing
operations.

Agenda Item 5

(submitted by the Delegation of the United Kingdom)

APPENDIX A (STATISTICS FROM COMMERCIAL FISHERIES) TO BIOLOGICAL 
INVESTIGATIONS OF MARINE ANTARCTIC SYSTEMS AND STOCKS (BIOMASS)

1. Catches.

The quantities should refer to nominal catches, ie the live 
weight of the animals as they leave the water, before any processing 
takes place. These nominal catch data, reported in metric tons, 
should be broken down as follows:

    (a) Time periods: These should be in calendar months. Annual 
    summaries should be for split years (1 July-30 June).

    (b) Species items: Categories should refer preferably to 
    individual species.

    (c) Fishing areas: The catch data reported should refer to 
    FAO 'Major Fishing Areas' 48, 58 and 88 taking account 
    of the sub-areas and divisions of those Antarctic fishing 
    areas.

    (d) Fishing gear: The catches should be broken down according to 
    the principal fishing methods used listed in FAO's 
    International Standard Statistical Classification of 
    Fishing Gear.

2. Fishing effort and corresponding catches.

Data of nominal catches should be provided for each fishing 
unit in accordance with the standard definitions and effort concepts 
established the Co-ordinating Working Party on Atlantic Fishery 
Statistics.

3. Fishing fleets.

Details should be given on all the individual units of fleets 
operating in one or more of the three FAO Antarctic Fishing Areas 
during a specified split year, 1 July-30 June. For each of these 
vessels the following information should be provided: (a) its 
nationality and name, (b) type of vessel, (c) overall length, 
(d) gross registered tonnage, (e) horsepower, (f) type or types of 
fishing gear, (g) personnel, (h) hold capacity for various products 
(i) special processing equipment.
