Provisional Agenda Item 10

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION CF THE IXth CONSULTATIVE MEETING
(Submitted by the Soviet Union Delegation)

The improvement of telecommunications in the Antarctic.

The Representatives,

Taking into account that:

1. The Antarctic system of telecommunications from year to year is acquiring ever greater significance in connection with the growing needs for collecting and disseminating administrative, scientific, meteorological and operative information;

2. In connection with the expansion of work in compiling weather forecasts in the Antarctic the problem of the rapid exchange of meteorological information in the area of operation of the Antarctic Treaty is becoming ever more acute;

3. Untimely transmission of meteorological facts gathered at Antarctic stations to world and corresponding regional hydrometeorological centres damages the World Weather Watch which is being developed;

Noting that:

1. Since the second meeting on telecommunications of the states participants of the Antarctic Treaty (Buenos Aires, 1969) serious changes have taken place both in the organisation of Antarctic telecommunications and in supplying Antarctic stations and centres with various equipment and telecommunications instrumentation;

2. The changes which have taken place have not always properly answered the needs for improving telecommunications in the Antarctic;

Considering that:

The proposals and measures annexed to this Recommendation are directed towards the improvement of the organisation of telecommunications and of the exchange of necessary information;
Drawin- attention to the fact that:

There continually exists the necessity to coorainate 
operational and technical procedures and practices applied 
at Antarctic stations and centres in organisin- telecommuni-
cations between these stations and centres;

Recommend to their Governments:

1. To continue to make efforts in the sphere of perfecting 
and improving meteorological telecommunications in the 
Antarctic taking account of the use of perfected ways and 
means in the sphere of telecommunications;

2. To approve the proposals annexed to this Recommendation;

3. To make provision in their plans of activity in the 
Antarctic for the necessary organisational and technical 
measures to realise these proposals.

                                                      the 9th Consultative Meeting
                                                      of the Antarctic Treaty (IX )

PROVISIONS CONCERNING TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA

Having regard to the importance of telecommunications in Antarctica,
d the necessity of their improvement, and considering that since
the 2nd Meeting of Experts (Buenos-Aires, 1969) substantial changes
have been made in the organization of, and exchange of information on,
telecommunications, the view is taken that a 3rd Meeting of national
telecommunication  experts of Contracting Parties to the Atlantic
Treaty should be convened in 1978, for a detailed review of the situation
of telecommunications in the Antarctic and particularly, inter alia,
the following matters:

-   Evaluation of the existing situation with respect to the
    organization of telecommunications, and the collection,
    exchange and dissemination of administrative, scientific,
    meteorological and operational information in Antarctic;

-   Analysis of the status of implementation of the recommendations
    concerning telecommunications adopted at this 9th meeting of
    governmental experts (Buenos-Aires, 1969);

-   Identification of the requirements of the Contracting Parties,
    and international organisations in respect of telecommunications
    and other information in Antarctica;
- Consideration and agreement of possible organizational and technical measures to meet the needs of telecommunications, meteorological and other information supplied by the Contracting Parties concerning the Antarctic;

- Development and coordination of the telecommunication network in the Antarctic, operating schedules and volume of information;

- Agreement of regulations and format for the exchange of operational information between the Contracting Parties to the Treaty in respect of changes in telecommunication operations and the volume of various kinds of information emanating from Antarctic centres and stations;

- Survey of the prospects for development of Antarctic telecommunications in the immediate future.
