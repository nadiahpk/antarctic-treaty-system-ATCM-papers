COOPERATION IN TRANSPORT

(Draft Recommendation submitted by the
US Delegation)

The Representatives,

  Recalling the appropriate provisions of the Treaty as well
as Recommendation VIII-7;

  Acknowledging the comprehensive report on transport resources
and potential requirements delivered to the Fourteenth Meeting of
the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

  Concurring that the most effective use of aviation assets
will be in coordinated air support projects (as circumstances
permit) without major additional construction or investment;

  Noting that new types of aircraft, equipment, and facilities
are either being developed or likely to be introduced, and the
continuing need for standardization of facilities and procedures
to ensure effective coordination;

  Recommend to their governments that:

1. They request SCAR, through their National Antarctic Committees,
to continue the work of the Sub-committee on Cooperative Air
Transport System for Antarctica (CATSA) of the Working Group on
Logistics.

2. They request their offices responsible for the administration
of Antarctic expeditions to adopt, to the extent practicable,
those measures for improved compatibility of facilities and
procedures as SCAR might be able to suggest.
