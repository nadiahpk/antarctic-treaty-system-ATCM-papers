WORKING GROUP ON MARINE LIVING RESOURCES
Note by Chairman                
                                 
At the conclusion of the Working Group's meeting
on 26 September, it was suggested from the Chair that
delegations might when discussion is resumed, consider
the following questions:         
                                 
(1) What form of arrangement are we aiming at
in the definitive stage?         
                                 
(2) In order to assist in determining what interim
arrangements may be needed, and how detailed
they should be, what timetable do we envisage
for the negotiation of a definitive regime?
                                 
(3) So that there may be a correlation between any
arrangements e.g. for collection of data began
in the interim period and what is envisaged for
the definitive régime, what should be the scope
of that régime, both geographically and in terms
of species if the ecosystem approach is favoured?
