ANTARCTIC MINERAL RESOURCES
Working Paper for the Working Group
(Legal and Political)

Draft Recommendation

The Representatives,

Recalling  the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, which
establishes a regime for international cooperation in Antarctica,
with the objective of ensuring that Antarctica should continue
forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and should
not become the scene or object of international discord;

Bearing in mind  the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty;

Convinced  that the framework established by the Antarctic
Treaty has proved effective in promoting international harmony
in furtherance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter, in ensuring the protection of the Antarctic environment,
and on promoting freedom of scientific research in Antarctica;

Noting  with thanks the Report of the Scientific Committee
on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Group of Specialists on the
Environmental Impact Assessment of Mineral Exploration/Exploitation
in Antarctica (EAMREA);

Recognizing  nevertheless that adequate scientific data
concerning the harmful environmental effects of activities related
to the exploration and exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources,
should they occur, are not yet available;

/Concerned
Concerned that unregulated activities related to exploration
and exploitation of mineral resources could adversely affect the
unique environment of the Antarctic and of other ecosystems
dependent on the Antarctic environment;

Conscious that the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty in carrying out scientific research in the area have
accumulated valuable experience and can substantially contribute
to the protection of the environment and the rational use of
Antarctic mineral resources, should exploration or exploitation
thereof occur;

Aware of the special responsibilities of Consultative
Parties to ensure that any activities in Antarctica, including
commercial exploration and exploitation in the future, should
not become the cause of international discord,
of danger to the unique Antarctic environment, of disruption to
scientific investigation, or be otherwise contrary to the principles
or purposes of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recommend to their governments that:

1. They reaffirm the basic principles set forth in Recommendation
VIII-14 of the Eight Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting;

2. They take note with appreciation of the Report of the Group
of Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation annexed
to the Report of the Ninth Consultative Meeting and make
the best possible use of its conclusions and guidelines;

3. They continue to study the environmental implications of
mineral resource activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area
and hold at a time and place to be arranged through diplomatic
channels a meeting of ecological and technological experts,
in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, with a view to
developing scientific programmes aimed at improving predictions
of the impact of possible technologies for mineral exploration
and exploitation in the Antarctic, as outlines in Section IIB
of the Report of the Group of Experts, and in Section 5 of
the SCAR EAMREA Group Report;  as well as the study of
measures for the prevention of damage to the environment or
for its rehabilitation, in accordance with Section IIC of
the Report of the Group of Experts;

                    /4.
4. They endorse the following principles elaborated at the Special Preparatory Meeting held in Paris from 28 June to 10 July 1976:-

(i) The Consultative Parties will continue to play an active and responsible role in dealing with the question of the mineral resources of Antarctica;

(ii) the Antarctic Treaty must be maintained in its entirety;

(iii) protection of the unique Antarctic environment and of its dependent ecosystems should be a basic consideration;

(iv) the Consultative Parties, in dealing with the question of mineral resources in Antarctica, should not prejudice the interests of all mankind in Antarctica;

5. They reaffirm that the regime should ensure that the principles embodied in Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty are safeguarded in its application to the areas covered by the regime.

6. They study the content of a future regime based on the principles contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 and on such further principles, rules and arrangements as may be agreed, taking full account of all proposals submitted to the IXth Consultative Meeting.

7. The subject "Antarctic Resources - The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be the subject of accelerated and intensified consultation among them and they urge the host Government of the Tenth Consultative Meeting to convene one or two meetings to consider legal and political aspects of mineral resource issues; the meetings to report to the Tenth Consultative Meeting with a view to reaching early agreement on a regime for mineral resources.

8. The subject "Antarctic Resources The Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" be placed on the Agenda of the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting;

    /9.
9.     They urge their nationals and other states to refrain from 
all exploration and exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources 
while making progress towards the timely adoption of an agreed 
regime.  They will thus endeavour to ensure that, pending the 
timely adoption of agreed solutions pertaining to exploration 
and exploitation of mineral resources, no activity shall be 
conducted to explore or exploit such resources.  They  will 
keep these matters [including the adequacy of these arrangements7 
under continuing examination.
