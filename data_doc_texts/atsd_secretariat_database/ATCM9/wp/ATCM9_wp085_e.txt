REPORT OF THE WORKING PARTY ON THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS OF ANTARCTIC              
MINERAL RESOURCES              

1.       The Working Party was set up in pursuance of the decision adopted by              
the Plenary Meeting on 20th September, 1977, and Ambassador J.C. Beltramino,              
the Delegate of Argentina, was elected to the chair.              

2.       Later, in accordance with Document ANT/IX/53, terms of reference were              
adopted for the Working Party which called upon it to examine some of the legal              
and political issues relating to the mineral resources of the Antarctic and to              
submit to the full meeting a report on its deliberations and a possible draft              
recommendation.              

3.       The Working Party carried out an exchange of views of a general nature,              
which took account of Documents ANT/IX/56 (Declaration of principles relating to              
the prospecting and exploitation of antarctic mineral resources, tabled by the              
Soviet Delegation), ANT/IX/57 (draft recommendation tabled by the Delegation of              
the United States of America) and ANT/IX/78 (draft recommendation submitted by              
the Australian Delegation).  This general exchange of views was followed by              
a debate on the proposals mentioned above and on the comments and observations              
made in regard to them.              

4.       In order, if possible, to arrive at a joint text for the draft              
recommendation to be put to the full meeting, the Working Party set up a              
Drafting Committee, the chairmanship of which was entrusted to Ambassador              
Stéphane Hessel, the Delegate of France.  This Drafting Committee had two              
meetings at which it considered a draft joint text prepared by its Chairman,              
which, having been approved, was submitted to the Working Party, with the              
exception of paragraphs 5, 7 and 9, concerning which agreement was not reached.              
An informal group worked out independently the text of a paragraph relating              
to abstention from activities.

5.     The Working Party on Legal and Political Issues listened to the report 
by Ambassador Hessel, the chairman of the Drafting Committee, and then proceeded 
to examine the proposed Draft Recommendation.  As the result of the debate, 
all the paragraphs of the Draft Recommendation, some with minor modifications, 
were adopted, with the exception of paragraphs 5, 7 and 9 which were objected 
to by two delegations.  It was agreed to recommend to the two delegations 
that they should endeavour to reach agreement prior to the full meeting. 
Approval of paragraph 5 was held in abeyance pending the decision arrived 
at by the Working Party on Marine Living Resources on the subject matter 
covered by this paragraph.

The Working Party also decided to append to its report both the 
Draft Recommendation and the proposal of the Soviet Delegation (ANT/IX/57).
