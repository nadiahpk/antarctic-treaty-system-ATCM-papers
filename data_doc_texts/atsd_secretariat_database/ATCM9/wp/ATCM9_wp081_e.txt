MESSAGE FROM THE IXTH CONSULTATIVE MEETING TO THE
ANTARCTIC STATIONS OF THE CONSULTATIVE PARTIES

(Draft message submitted by the Chairman of the
Consultative Meeting)

Representatives of the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty have just completed three weeks of discussions at the
IXth Consultative Meeting as guests of the British Government.
Resource issues were uppermost in the minds of representatives
but sight was not lost of the value of the Antarctic as a unique
research laboratory, or of the contribution to the advancement
of science being made there by your various research programmes.
The aim of representatives in seeking a solution to resource
problems has therefore been to ensure that resource exploitation
is not allowed to jeopardise the Antarctic environment or its
ecosystem, and to ensure that any exploitation that may be carried
out causes as little harm as possible.

In participating in these discussions, representatives have
been conscious that scientists of the Treaty states have just
completed another winter of activity in stations all over the
continent, and as the austral summer approaches all delegations
send to you their best wishes for a successful year.

(It is proposed that the message will be sent to Antarctic
stations via British Antarctic Survey stations)
