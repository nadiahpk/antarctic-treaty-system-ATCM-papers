DRAFT RECOMMENDATION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FISHING				
DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM				
                                                                                
The Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting,				
                                                                                
Considering that any system of rational management of marine				
living resources must be based on preliminary scientific research,				
                                                                                
Considering that such research cannot be undertaken unless				
fishing data (statistics broken down according to species or				
groups of species, fishing effort, fishing zones) are well-known				
and centralised,				
                                                                                
Recommends that each Consultative Party to the Antarctic				
Treaty send its data on experimental or commercial fishing to a				
permanent office on an annual basis,				
                                                                                
Recommends that the Consultative Parties invite other				
countries which are involved in fishing activities in the Antarctic				
whether or not signatories to the Antarctic Treaty likewise to				
forward their fishing data annually to the permanent office,				
                                                                                
Recommends the creation of a permanent office with the functions				
of:				
                                                                                
(a) organizing the collection of fishing data;				
                                                                                
(b) specifying the nature of such data and the form in				
which they are to be furnished;				
                                                                                
(c) arranging for such data to be analysed by a specialist				
body;				
                                                                                
(d) reporting annually to the Consultative Parties to the				
Antarctic Treaty,				
                                                                                
Recommends that this office be converted at a later stage				
into a permanent secretariat for the Commission set up by any				
subsequently concluded International Convention for the Conservation				
of the Antarctic Marine Ecosystem.
