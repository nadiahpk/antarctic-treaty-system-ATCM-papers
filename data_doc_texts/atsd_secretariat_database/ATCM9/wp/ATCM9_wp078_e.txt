The Representatives :

Recommend to their Governments that :

They refrain from authorising or undertaking any exploration
for or exploitation of the mineral resources of the Antarctic
Treaty area, including the continental margin of Antarctica,
pending :

        (a)     the completion of the studies being undertaken at the
                initiative of the Consultative Parties on the environ -
                mental implications of mineral resource activities in
                the Antarctic Treaty area,

        (b)     the establishment of the necessary environmental
                protection arrangements and

        (c)     the establishment of appropriate machinery to supervise
                and administer any exploration and exploitation activities.

2.      They record their understanding that the provisions of this
recommendation are without prejudice to the freedom of scientific
investigation as provided for in Article II of the Antarctic
Treaty and in respect of which scientific observations and
results are exchanged and made freely available in accordance
with the provisions of Article III of that Treaty.

3.      They review, after a period of five years, the operation
and implementation of this recommendation in the light of progress
achieved towards the completion of the studies and the establish -
ment of the arrangements and machinery referred to in Paragraph 1 of
this recommendation.
