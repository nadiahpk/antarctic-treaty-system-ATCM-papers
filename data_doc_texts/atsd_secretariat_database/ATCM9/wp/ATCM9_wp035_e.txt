Draft Recommendation

The Representatives

Having regard to the characteristics and development of
scientific research in Antarctica in accordance with the principles
and provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and approved recommendations,

Bearing in mind that the Preamble of the Antarctic Treaty acknowledges the
importance of the contributions made to scientific knowledge as a result
of international co-operation in scientific research in Antarctica,

Bearing in mind that the establishment of a sound basis such as that of
the actual Treaty is in the interests of science and the progress of
ell humanity.

Bearing in mind that Article II of the Treaty provides for freedom of
scientific research in Antarctica and co-operation to this end, as
occurred during the International Geophysical Year, subject to its
provisions,

Considering that such freedom of scientific research, as agreed during
the preparations for the International Geophysical Year, primarily
involves freedom of selection of the scientific disciplines to be
investigated, and of movement and consutruction of bases and installations
along the lines of a rigorously established plan,

Recommend to the governments of the consultative parties that, when examining the
possibility of establishing new bases, they should take account of the need to
ensure a rational and adequate geographical distribution of bases throughout the
whole of Antarctica.

?ecommend that the Governments of the Contracting Parties adhering to the
Treaty should, when examining the possibilities of establishing bases,
do so according to the same crit ria.
