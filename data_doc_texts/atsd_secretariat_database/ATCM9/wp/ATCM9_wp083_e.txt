by Representatives who decided that it should be annexed to the

12. Review of Conservation Measures and Sites of Special Scientific Interest

In Plenary Session on 30 September 1977 the Delegation of the United Kingdom drew attention to an error in the latitude of Litchfield Island shown on the map attached to Recommendation VIII-1, and to the fact that in the Management Plan for Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 6 attached to Recommendation VIII-4 reference is made to four areas whilst the attached map shows only three.  The Representatives agreed that corrections could be effected by the inclusion in this Final Report of the following paragraph:

"The attention of the Representatives was drawn to two errors in Recommendations VIII-1 and VIII-4 respectively.  The Representatives decided to correct the latitude shown on the map attached to Recommendation VIII-1 so as to read 66° 16' S. The Representatives decided to remove the discrepancy from the management plan for Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 6 (attached to Recommendation VIII-4) by substituting the word 'three' for the word 'four'."

13. Telecommunications

The Working Group discussed ways of speeding up the improvement of the telecommunications network in Antarctica, of improving the value of the information transmitted and of arranging for the studies of scientific and technical developments
which apply to the area.  It recommended that telecommunications 
experts should meet before the Tenth Consultative Meeting to 
analyse data compiled by Governments about the composition, 
characteristics, timing, frequencies and current equipment of 
their programmes in the area, and to put forward recommendations 
for improvements.

14. Tourism

No action was taken to list or define areas of Special 
Tourist Interest for inclusion in Annex B of Recommendation VIII-9.

15. Activities in the Antarctic of Other States

This question was widely discussed in view of the action 
taken by Consultative Parties at the first Special Consultative 
Meeting held in London on 25, 27 and 29 July.  In this connection 
Consultative Parties welcomed the precedent established by Poland, 
in accordance with paragraph 2 of Recommendation VIII-8, with 
regard to approval of the Recommendations of Consultative Meetings.

In pursuance of the objectives of the Treaty, the 
Representatives considered there should be uniformity of practice 
in the activities of all Parties acting in Antarctica.

In connection with substantial or continuing activities or 
territorial claims in the Antarctic Treaty area by States that 
are not Contracting Parties of the Treaty, the Representatives 
recalled their agreed view expressed in the Final Report of the 
Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting that, in such 
circumstances, it would be advisable for Governments to consult 
together as provided for by the Treaty and be ready to urge or 
invite as appropriate the State or States concerned to accede 
to the Treaty, point out the rights and benefits they would 
receive, and also the responsibilities and obligations of 
contracting parties.

16. Messages

During the course of the Ninth Consultative Meeting it 
was unanimously agreed that the greetings of all Representatives 
be conveyed to the Antarctic Stations of the Consultative Parties. 
The text is at Annex I.
17. Representatives accepted with pleasure the invitation of the Representative of the United States to hold the Tenth Consultative meeting in Washington, D.C. in the latter part of 1978 or early 1979.

Paragraph for insertion in the Final Report      

Living Resources      
7      

10. bis. The Working Group agreed to include in its Report      
the understanding of the Group that the word "conservation"      
as used in the draft recommendation includes rational use,      
in the sense that harvesting would not be prohibited, but the      
regime would exclude catch allocation and other economic      
regulation of harvesting.  It was similarly the understanding      
of the Group that the word "resources" was not limited to      
commercially exploitable species.

Agenda Item 16        

MARINE SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST        
PROPOSED FOR INCLUSION IN THE FINAL REPORT        
(Submitted by the Delegation of Chile)        

The Meeting considered the question of the designation        
of Marine Sites of Special Scientific Interest and the opinion        
was expressed that SCAR should be invited to examine this        
matter attentively.  In this connection, the Consultative        
Parties noted that the Government of Chile intended to propose        
to SCAR, following agreed procedures, two Marine Sites of        
Special Scientific Interest.
