COOPERATION IN TRANSPORT
(Draft Recommendation Submitted by the U.S. Delegation)

The Representatives:

Recalling Recommendation VIII-7;

Acknowledging the comprehensive report on transport resources and potential requirements delivered to the Fourteenth Meeting of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

Concurring that the most effective use of aviation assets will be in coordinated air support projects without major additional construction or investment;

Noting that new types of aircraft, equipment, and facilities are either being developed or likely to be introduced, and the continuing need for standardization of facilities and procedures to ensure effective coordination;

Recommend to their governments that:

1. They request SCAR, through their National Antarctic Committees, to continue the work of the Sub-committee on Cooperative Air Transport System for Antarctica (CATSA) of the Working Group on Logistics.

2. They request their offices responsible for the administration of Antarctic expeditions to adopt, to the extent practicable, those measures for improved compatibility of facilities and procedures as SCAR might be able to suggest.

3. They pursue coordination of Air Transport in Antarctica wherever mutually beneficial, with particular reference to Treaty Articles I, II and IV.
