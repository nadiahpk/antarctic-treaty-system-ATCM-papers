The Representatives,              

Recalling Articles II and IX of the Antarctic Treaty and              
Recommendations VII-3, VIII-3 and VIII-10;

such studies;              

Desiring to protect such scientific investigations from

Recommend to their Governments that they invite SCAR,              
through their national Committees, to consider proposals on              
this matter and to make suggestions for the designation of              
Marine Sites of Special Scientific Interest for consideration              
at the Tenth Consultative Meeting.             
The Delegation of Chile submits this paragraph for

Parties noted that the Government of Chile intended to propose 
to SCAR, following agreed procedures, two Marine Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest in South Bay, Doumer Island,

Shetland Islands."
