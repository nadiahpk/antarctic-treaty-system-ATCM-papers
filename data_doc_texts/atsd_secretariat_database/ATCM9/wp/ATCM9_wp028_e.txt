Agenda Item 8                   
PRIVATE EXPEDITIONS             
(Draft recommendation submitted by the United Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Reaffirming the traditional Antarctic principle that expeditions render all assistance feasibile in the event of an emergency request for help, as stated in Recommendation I - X,

Noting that private expeditions may also give rise to a need for rescue operations and that as a result scientific stations may incur expenditure and diversion of resources,

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They supply on request all available information about a private expedition to the Treaty area of which they have knowledge;

2. They urge all private expeditions to carry adequate insurance cover against the risk of their incurring financial charges or material losses in the Treaty area.
