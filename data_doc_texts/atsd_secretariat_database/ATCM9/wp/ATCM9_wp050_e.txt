Review of Conservation Measures 
and Sites of Special Scientific Interest

The Delegation of the United Kingdom wish to draw attention to 
an error in the latitude shown on the map attached to           
Recommendation VIII-1. The text of the Recommendation gives the 
latitude of Litchfield Island as 66° 16' S, which is correct, but 
on the attached map the line of latitude is marked as 64° 46' S, 
which is incorrect.                                               

Attention is also invited to the management plan for Site        
of Special Scientific Interest No 6 which is attached to         
Recommendation VIII-4. The management plan refers to "four areas" 
whilst the attached map shows only three.                         

The Delegation of the United Kingdom proposes that these two     
discrepancies should be corrected. Having regard to international 
practice, it is suggested that correction could be effected by   
including a suitable passage in the Final Report of the present  
Consultative Meeting. Such a paragraph could read along the      
following lines:                                                 

"The attention of the Representatives was drawn to two          
errors in RecommendationsVIII-1 and VIII-4 respectively.         
The Representatives decided to correct the latitude              
shown on the map attached to Recommendation VIII-1 so           
as to read 66° 16' S. The Representatives decided to             
remove the discrepancy from the management plan for              
Site of Special Scientific Interest No 6 (attached to           
Recommendation VIII-4) by substituting the word 'three'          
for the word 'four'."
