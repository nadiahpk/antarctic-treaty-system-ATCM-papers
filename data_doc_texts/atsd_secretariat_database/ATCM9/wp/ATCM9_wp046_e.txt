Agenda Item 10

THE IMPACT OF MAN ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING THE ADOPTION OF MEASURES TO
PREVENT OIL CONTAMINATION

ARGENTINA:  DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

The Representatives,

Considering that Article IX, lf) of the Antarctic Treaty
provides for the adoption of measures for safeguarding the living
resources of Antarctica and the constant concern of the Consultative
Parties for this conservation;

Considering the presence in the Treaty area, especially during
the summer, of ships, including oil tankers, and that this traffic
may increase in future;

Considering the special importance attaching to the disturbances
caused by the discharge into antarctic waters of oil and its
derivatives, as these may affect the plankton on which the very
survival of a large number of animal species depends;

Considering that, in view of the oceanographic, ice and
climatic conditions obtaining in this area, the extent and permanent
character of these disturbances may become greater than in other
areas of the world;

Considering the need to adopt more precise standards than those
which exist (Recommendation VII-II) to prevent the discharge of oil
and that the Agreements to which the Contracting Parties of the
Antarctic Treaty are party are inadequate in this respect;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that:

1. The Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) should
be invited to investigate via its Logistics Group the problems
/arising
arising from the discharge into antarctic waters of oil 
and its derivatives, to propose the norms which it 
considers necessary in the light of the special environmental 
conditions and the relevant existing agreements, and to 
present a report to the next Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting;

2. The problem of the discharge by tankers of oil and its 
derivatives should again be discussed at the Tenth Antarctic 
Treaty Consultative Meeting under the heading of 'The 
Impact of Man on the Antarctic Environment'.
