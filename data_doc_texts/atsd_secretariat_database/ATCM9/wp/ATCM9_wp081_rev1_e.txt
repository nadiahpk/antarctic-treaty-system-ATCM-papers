MESSAGE FROM THE IXTH CONSULTATIVE MEETING TO THE
ANTARCTIC STATIONS OF THE CONSULTATIVE PARTIES

(Draft message submitted by the Chairman of the
Consultative Meeting)

Representatives of the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty have just completed three weeks of discussions at the
IXth Consultative Meeting as guests of the British Government.

In recognizing the importance of your work being carried out
in a full spirit of cooperation in the Antarctic and that
your continuing research programmes in this area will contribute
to the furthering of science, the representatives gave particular
attention to the need for continued concern and protection
for the environment in all future activities that might take
place.

In participating in these discussions, representatives have
been conscious that scientists of the Treaty states have just
completed another winter of activity in stations all over the
continent, and as the austral summer approaches all delegations
send to you their best wishes for a successful year.

(It is proposed that the message will be sent to Antarctic
stations via British Antarctic Survey stations.)
