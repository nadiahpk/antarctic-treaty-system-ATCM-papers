DECLARATION CONCERNING THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNATIONAL              
SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION IN ANTARCTICA              

PRESENTED BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILE              

The Governments taking part in the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative              
Meeting held in accordance with Article IX.of the Antarctic Treaty:              

Reaffirming  that it is in the interests of  all mankind  that              
the Antarctic should continue permanently to be used exclusively for peaceful              
purposes and should not become the scene or object of international discord;              

Convinced  of the need to continue developing international cooperation on              
the basis of freedom of research, in the manner practised during  International              
Geophysical Year and as guaranteed by the Antarctic Treaty, in line with the              
interests of science and the progress of mankind  as a whole;              

Recognizing  that the prime responsibility in antarctic matters, including              
the protection of the antarctic environment, rests with those countries which              
are engaged in activities in the region and which are parties to the Antarctic              
Treaty;              

Considering  that, while the antarctic environment derives a large part of              
its scientific importance from its uncontaminated and undisturbed state, the              
ecosystem of Antarctica is particularly vulnerable to the various forms of human              
interference;              

Conscious  of their obligation, consistent with the United Nations Charter,              
to take appropriate measures to ensure that nobody engages in the Antarctic              
in activities which may be considered contrary to the principles and objectives              
of the Antarctic Treaty;              

a) Have negotiated the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic              
Fauna and Flora, approved at the Third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
b) Have negotiated the Agreement for the Protection of the Antartic Seal,
signed on 1st June, 1972, in London.

c) Have designated Specially Protected Zones and Places of Special Scientific
Interest.

d) Have adopted measures for the preservation and protection from destruction
of historic monuments and remains in the area of the Antartic Treaty.

e) Have approved a Code of Conduct to govern the activities of bases and
antarctic expeditions.

f) Have encouraged studies of the Southern Ocean carried out with the
cooperation of SCAR and the International Coordinating Group for this ocean.

g) Have recognized the special scientific interest which would attach to
new islands formed in the Antartic by geological processes, and the need to
adopt in consultation appropriate measures to secure their protection.

h) Have concerned themselves with bringing about the prohibition of the
discharge of nuclear waste in Antartica and with the application of standards
governing the use of radioisotopes in experiments carried out in the antarctic
continent.

i) Have invited SCAR to identify the various aspects of human interference,
to suggest measures for reducing it and to work out programmes for the evaluation
of any harmful effects on the antartic ecosystem.

j) Have also asked SCAR to evaluate the adverse impact on the antarctic
environment, and on the ecosystems dependent on it, of possible prospecting and
mining activities.

In line with the responsibilities and obligations laid upon them by the
Antarctic Treaty with its range of activities covering discovery, exploration,
scientific research and protection of the antarctic ecosystem for the benefit
of humanity as a whole, they solemnly adopt the following Declaration:

The participating Governments declare that Antarctica is a Continent of Peace,
wholly dedicated to science and international cooperation for the good of Mankind.
II

They recognize once again the importance of preserving the antarctic 
environment, because of its peculiar character and its exceptional scientific 
and global value, and they undertake to safeguard its integrity and to ensure 
the protection of its fauna and flora.

III

They ratify their decision to consider the whole of the Treaty Area as 
a Special Conservation Zone, as defined in the Preamble to the Measures Agreed 
for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

IV

They reaffirm their intention of contributing to the phased execution of 
a comprehensive study of the Southern Ocean, considered as forming an integral 
part of the antarctic environment, and agree to give their wholehearted support 
to the BIOMASS Programme (Biological Investigation of Marine Antarctic Systems 
and Stocks).

V

They reaffirm their will to keep Antarctica a non-nuclear zone free from 
any form of nuclear contamination, to which end they will continue in their 
endeavours to ensure that nobody shall dispose of nuclear waste in the Treaty 
area.

VI

They agree to pursue their joint consultations within the framework provided 
by the Antarctic Treaty to determine the most appropriate means of establishing 
as quickly as possible measures aimed at the conservation of the living marine 
resources of Antarctica.

VII

They resolve to pursue their investigations into the evaluation of the 
possible effects on the antarctic environment, and on the other dependent
antartic ecosystems, of possible mineral mining activities with particular attention 
to the harm to the marine environment of the region which might result.

VIII

They reaffirm that the freedom of research and the cooperation aimed at 
achieving it, which were practised during International Geophysical Year, 
shall continue, subject to the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty by which 
they are guaranteed. They also reaffirm that they will continue to adopt 
all measures which facilitate international scientific cooperation in the region, 
including the consolidation of those links which already exist and the establishment 
of working relationships with the specialist organs of the United Nations and other 
international organizations having a scientific interest in the Antarctic.

IX

Within this context, they recommend that activities carried on in the 
Antarctic should as far as possible avoid the duplication of effort in both 
geographical zones and scientific disciplines and that these should be directed 
towards little-explored areas and fields of study in which contributions would 
be of even greater significance.

X

They agree on the desirability of revising and regularly up-dating the 
status of the Specially Protected Zones and Places of Special Scientific Interest 
and of joint consultations between themselves regarding other measures for the 
protection of the antarctic environment which might be necessary bearing constantly 
in mind the fundamental purpose of the Antarctic Treaty which is 
the whole area located south of latitude 60o south for peaceful activities and, 
in particular, for scientific research.
