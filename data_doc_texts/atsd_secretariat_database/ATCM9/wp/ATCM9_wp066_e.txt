OPENING STATEMENT BY MR S KADOTA
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF JAPAN
Thank you Mr Chairman.

I wish to join the previous speakers in congratulating
you on your election as the chairman of this Consultative
meeting.

I wish also to thank the UK government - the host
government - for the courtesy and efficiency with which it
has prepared and organized this meeting.

I would also like to welcome most cordially the 
Delegation of the Polish Government among us.  May I say
that my delegation wishes to collaborate most closely with
the Delegation of Poland in the future work of this group.

I would like to take this opportunity to make one
remark on the work of the present Consultative Party.

We see in the agenda that the question of resources -
both living and mineral - has now become a central issue
for the Consultative Parties of the Antarctic Treaty.

We know, through our preliminary studies of this question,
that it represents a major challenge to us all, possibly
involving the interpretation and implementation of Article 4
of the Treaty.  And we think most imaginative efforts may be
needed on the part of all of us to deal with this important
question.  I believe that in meeting with such a challenge,
it is essential that the integrity of the Antarctic regime,
which has been built up and consolidated in the course of the
past 18 years, should not be weakened but be further
strengthened. The Japanese Delegation will spare no
efforts in this regard.
