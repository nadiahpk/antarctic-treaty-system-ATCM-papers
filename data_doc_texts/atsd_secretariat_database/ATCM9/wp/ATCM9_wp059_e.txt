COOPERATION IN TRANSPORT              
(Draft Recommendation Submitted by the U.S. Delegation)              

The Representatives:              

Recalling Recommendation VIII-7;              

Acknowledging the comprehensive report on transport resources and potential requirements delivered to the Fourteenth Meeting of SCAR;              

Concurring that the most effective use of aviation assets will be in coordinated air support projects without major additional construction or investment;              

Noting the continuing need for standardization of facilities and procedures to ensure effective coordination;              

Recommend to their governments that:              

1. They request SCAR, through their National Antarctic Committees, to continue the work of the Subcommittee on CATSA of the Working Group on Logistics, with emphasis upon the "Stage 1" concept.              

2. They request their offices responsible for the administration of Antarctic expeditions to adopt, to the extent practicable, those measures for improved compatibility of facilities and procedures as SCAR might be able to suggest.              

3. They pursue coordination of transport in Antarctica wherever mutually beneficial, with particular reference to Treaty Articles I, II and IV.
