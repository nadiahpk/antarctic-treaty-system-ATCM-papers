Agenda Item 6

Working paper submitted by the Chilean Delegation

The Representatives, having regard to Article IX(1) of the 
Antarctic Treaty, and recalling inter alia Recommendations I-VIII, 
II-II, III-VIII, VII-6 and VIII-10, recommend their Governments 
to approve as soon as possible and implement forthwith the 
measures set out below for the conservation of marine living 
resources:

Article 1 - Area of application. The agreed measures shall apply 
to the same area as the Treaty, namely south of 60° South latitude.

No provision of these measures may be regarded as detracting 
from the rights, claims or views of any of the Contracting Parties 
in respect of sovereignty over territorial waters, jurisdiction 
over the fisheries of the coastal state, or corresponding or 
liable to correspond to other maritime prerogatives and areas.

Article 2 - Resources included. These measures shall apply to marine 
living resources and organisms within the scope of the Antarctic 
Treaty, except such species as are already subject to international 
control and without prejudice to previous recommendations under the 
Treaty.

Article 3 - Aims. The object of the measures shall be to ensure a 
system governing Antarctic marine living resources according to 
well-founded principles and practices of conservancy, and in 
particular:

a) to prevent any over-exploitation of whatsoever marine 
living organism in the Antarctic;

b) to make sure that the exploitation of particular species 
does not adversely affect species dependent upon or
/related
c) to make sure that exploitation of given species is 
effected without impairment to the integrity of the 
Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole.

Article 4 - Agreed Measures

a) Collection and interchange  of basic scientific data 
on the nature, reciprocal relationships and dynamics 
of the Antarctic marine ecosystem;

b) collection and interchange of quantitative data on 
stocks of Antarctic marine living resources and 
detailed data on the levels for whatsoever exploitation of 
such species;

c) evaluation of the current status of stocks of 
Antarctic marine living resources;

d) determining the stocks of the species to which the 
   agreed conservation measures shall apply;

e) determining the quantity of each species that can 
be harvested without endangering the self-regeneration 
capability of the resource;

f) determining harvesting and closed seasons  for each 
species;

g) determining zones to be harvested and closed zones, 
including special zones for the protection and 
scientific study of given species;

h) limitations on catches and methods;

i) notification of figures of catches and other statistical 
and biological data;

j) adoption of procedures to facilitate the scrutiny and 
analysis of scientific information;

k) implementation of an effective inspection system;

l) any further aspect the Contracting Parties may deem 
necessary for fulfilment of the aims of these 
measures.

/Article 5
Article 5 - Machinery. Agreement shall be reached on a coordinated 
action by the Contracting Parties enabling supplementary 
conservation measures to be taken at periodical meetings at 
technical level. This should be the form in which action is 
taken to:

    a) collect, collate and disseminate the requisite 
       scientific data (in collaboration with SCAR);

    b) collect, collate and disseminate quantitative 
       data of stocks and catches, possibly in cooperation 
       with other bodies, in accordance with Article 3 (2) 
       of the Antarctic Treaty;

    c) evaluate and review the current status of stocks 
       of Antarctic marine living resources (in collaboration 
       with SCAR and other bodies, in accordance with 
       Article 3 (2) of the Antarctic Treaty);

    d) monitor the efficacy of the conservation measures.

Article 6 - Acknowledging the need to have available all the 
necessary information for framing effective conservation measures, 
it is agreed to support the BIOMASS programme drawn up by the 
SCAR/SCOR Group of Specialists on the Living Resources of the 
Southern Ocean.
