DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON ANTARCTIC MARINE
LIVING RESOURCES SUBMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES

The Representatives

Recalling the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty,
including the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty;

Bearing in mind the objective of preservation and conservation
of living resources in Antarctica as set forth in Article IX, para 2(f)
of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that major concentrations of marine living resources
are found in the Antarctic Treaty area and adjacent waters;

Recognizing the urgency of ensuring that commercial harvesting
of these marine living resources takes place in accordance with
sound conservation standards which will  prevent over-fishing and
protect the health of the Antarctic eco-system as a whole;

Aware of the inadequacy of information concerning the stocks
of the Antarctic marine living resources and of the importance of
sound scientific data as a basis for effective conservation measures;

Convinced that provision for effective measures to conserve
Antarctic marine living resources, as well as for collection and
analysis of the data necessary to develop these measures, requires
early conclusion of an internationally agreed arrangement, consistent
with the Antarctic Treaty and the interests of the international com-
munity;

Recommend to their governments that:

1) They, along with other States having substantial interests
in Antarctic living resources, participate in negotiations, in the
( 2 )

first half of 1978, to conclude a convention to establish an inter-
nationally agreed arrangement to conserve Antarctic marine living
resources;

2) They incorporate into the internationally agreed arrangement
the following elements:

   -- the arrangement be directed to fishery resources and not
directly apply to species already regulated pursuant to existing
international agreements, provided that the arrangement take account
of the relationship of species covered to other species and to the
Antarctic eco-system as a whole.

   -- the arrangement provide for effective conservation of the
species covered throughout their entire range.

   --the arrangement provide for and encourage participation by all
interested states, as well as for cooperative relationships with
the Antarctic Treaty Consultative forum and other appropriate
international bodies.

   --the arrangement establish a separate institutional body to
develop and implement necessary conservation measures, as well as
to collect and analyze the data necessary for development of effec-
tive conservation measures.

   -- the arrangement provide for effectiye enforcement arrange-
ments.

2. They encourage further cooperation among the Consultative
Parties in scientific studies and programs relating to Antarctic
marine resources.

3. They urge the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR), through their National Antarctic Committees, to continue
(3)

its scientific work on these matters and, in particular, to accord
priority attention to the BIOMASS program.
