POSSIBILITIES OF OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IN THE ANTARCTIC FROM A
MOBILE FLOATING PLATFORM

(Paper submitted by the Delegation of France)

ew
FOREWORD

In comparison with the ordinary offshore environment, that of the
Antarctic differs mainly by reason of the permanent or seasonal existence
of pack ice and the continuous presence of icebergs. This document analyses
the possibilities of oil drilling in this environment during the ice-free
season, using a mobile floating platform capable of working in the presence
of icebergs, but not designed to withstand the forces exerted by the pack ice
This mobile floating platform will henceforth be referred to as DYPO ("support
de forage flottant à Positionnement DYnamique") in this report.

1 - ENVIRONNENTAL CONSTRAINTS
=========================

1.1 - ICE-FREE SEASON AND DEPTH OF WATER

Allowing for annual variations, the use of the DYPO can be contemplated
only in the zone where the average duration of the ice-free season exceeds 3
months; this is generally sufficient time to drill a deep borehole.
These zones (Figure 1) are generally situated beyond the 2,000-m isobath.
Depths might be less where the PALMER Peninsular extends     into the sea.

1.2 - ICEBERGS

Whilst some knowledge of the icebergs has been gained from Antarctic
expeditions and satellite photographs, it is nevertheless limited and imperfect:

  - Number of icebergs
The number of icebergs decreases as the distance from the Pole increases.
Icebergs are encountered throughout the year in all the Antarctic offshore
zones (south of 60° S).

  - Rate of drift
The icebergs are propelled by the wind and currents. Their average speed is
probably about 0.4 knot, with a maximum of about 2 knots.

· Frequency
Knowledge of their numbers in a given zone and of the distribution of 
rates of drift makes it possible to calculate approximately the frequency 
of icebergs at a given point. This factor is critical for forecasting the 
frequency of disconnection and reconnection by means of the DYPO.

· Mass
The mass of some icebergs has been estimated at several thousand million 
tonnes. The distribution of masses would make it possible to determine the 
expediency of towing, a solution which is effective for icebergs of a mass 
of less than about 1 million tonnes, and which reduces the frequency of 
disconnection and reconnection.

· Draught
The limit of the glaciers is often in the vicinity of the 200-m isobath, which 
leads one to expect that many icebergs might have a draught of less than 
200 - 300 m.
This does not preclude the possibility of icebergs whose draught exceeds 
300 m. However, at depths of over 2,000 m, the risk of running aground 
is probably nil.

1.3 - METEOROLOGICAL/OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS

1.3.1 Wind
Data from shore stations indicate extremely/violent winds (over 250 km/hour) in 
the case of katabatic wind (katabatic wind is the result of instability 
of a mass of air on the ice cap), but this phenomenon is confined to the 
coastal zones.
During the ice-free season the sea winds are more moderate, but 
nevertheless quite strong.
at the end of the ice-free season, there is a danger of icing of sea spray 
on the superstructures in critical wind and temperature conditions.

1.3.2 Currents
Surface currents are generally of low intensity (less than 1 knot). The 
profile of the currents according to depth will have to be specified. This 
parameter is critical for the behaviour of the risers.

1.3.3 Swell
Swells are rarely observed. Very substantial fetches would probably cause 
difficult sea conditions. The DYPOs will have to be particularly 
seaworthy.

2 - EXISTENCE OF COLD SEAS (ARCTIC)
=====================================================

Offshore oil drilling in the Arctic (Labrador) has been carried out from 
a DYPO (boat) since 1973. Since then, the industry has developed DYPOS better 
suited to difficult sea conditions (semi-submersible). Moreover, iceberg 
precaution procedures have become routine.

2.1 - DYPOS

The first DYPOS were designed according to the following basic criteria:
-   Dynamic positioning permitting a rapid departure from the site.
-   A high transit speed to permit a quick return to  distant operating zones.
-   A high endurance so as to reduce dependence on shore bases.

Several of these DYPOS(boat) are now operational and effective. A new DYPO 
(semi-submersible) recently commissioned also offers improved seaworthiness.

2.2 - PROCEDURES FOR COPING WITH ICEBERGS

After being picked up on the radar screen at a distance of about 10 miles 
from the DYPO, the icebergs are continually monitored and specialised observers 
estimate their speed and direction of drift at regular intervals.

estimated

If there is a danger that their/course may affect current drilling operations, 
an attempt at towing is made. The tug will put a tow round the iceberg and try 
to divert it from its natural course so that it no longer endangers the DYPO. There 
are doubts as to the effectiveness of this operation in many cases: if the mass of 
the iceberg exceeds 2 million tonnes; if the sea is too rough to work at sea; if 
the iceberg capsizes; if the tow breaks, etc. Hence all that towing can do is to 
reduce the probability of leaving the site.

If the iceberg continues in the direction of the DYPO and cannot be diverted, 
the procedure for leaving the site is applied:

-   Some time is necessary to secure the well, which means that this operation 
must start when the iceberg crosses a safety perimeter whose size will vary 
according to the operation in progress. It may be large in the case of test 
operations, medium (3- 4 mile radius) in the case of deep drilling operations, and 
small (1 mile radius) when starting a hole. When the well is secure the DYPO, still 
attached to the bottom, waits to see whether the iceberg will move away or whether 
the threat will materialise.

-   The disconnection perimeter depends only on the time needed to disconnect and 
manoeuvre the DYPO. This time is about 1 minute, and is independent of the 
previous operations in progress. If the iceberg crosses this perimeter the 
decision to leave is taken, the riser is disconnected and the DYPO manoeuvres 
to avoid the iceberg.

-   As soon as the danger has passed, the DYPO will take up station again and the 
riser be reconnected.

The advantage of the DYPO is greater in iceberg zones because of the extremely 
short time needed to leave the site in comparison with a conventionally-anchored 
platform.
3 - DEEP-SEA EXPERIENCE
=========================

The following are now used for deep-sea exploration:
- drilling platforns anchored to the bottom;
- DYO?s (e.g. P?LERIN)
(cf. figure 2).

The technology of the drilling equipment is the same in both cases, and the techniq  necessary for exploring in depths of 1,000 m of water are now operational.

The following items in particular have been developed:
- the risers;
- the disconnection equipment;
- the remote controls for closing devices;
- the re-entry equipment;
- the sea-bed operating facilities.

:esearch aimed at adapting these techniques and this equipment to depths of 3,000 m of water is now in progress, with a view to their becoming operational in the early 1980s.

4      CONCLUSION
===============

In the Antarctic, the use of a floating drilling platform not designed 
to withstand the forces exerted by pack ice  is limited to zones of deep water 
(2,000 m or more). This depth and the need to deal with the iceberg menace 
preclude the use of conventional anchorages and necessitate dynamic positioning.

The DYPO concept has proved effective in iceberg zones, deep-water (1,000 m) 
zones and distant-water zones. Present trends suggest that the DYPO may be 
operational in 3,000 m of water by the early 1980s.

It is thus reasonable to believe that it will be technically possible to 
explore the deep-water zones of the Antarctic in the course of the next decade.
