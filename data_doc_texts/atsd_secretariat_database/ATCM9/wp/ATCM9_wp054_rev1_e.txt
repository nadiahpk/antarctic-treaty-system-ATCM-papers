ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES:              
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH              

(Submitted by France and the United Kingdom)              

The Representatives,              

Recalling Recommendation VIII - 10;              

Aware of the inadequacy of the information concerning the              
biology, distribution, bio-mass, population dynamics and the              
ecology of Antarctic marine living resources;              

Recognizing the need to develop a good scientific foundation              
for appropriate conservation measures and rational management              
policies for all Antarctic marine living resources;              

Considering the major part played by Antarctic marine living              
resources in the distribution and regeneration of nutrients in the              
World's Oceans;              

Noting with appreciation the response of the Scientific              
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to Recommendation VIII - 10              
and the preparation by the SCAR/SCOR Group of Specialists on              
Living Resources of the Southern Ocean (Scientific Committee on              
Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group 54) of the Biological              
Investigation of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS)              
programme;              

And noting the valuable contributions to the BIOMASS programme              
that can be made by any vessel operating in the Antarctic.              

Recommend to their Governments that:              

1. They initiate or expand, insofar as is practicable,              
detailed studies that will contribute to the practical              
implementation of the BIOMASS research programme;              
              /2.
2. They undertake, in planning their marine activities in the Antarctic:-

(a) to have regard to the advantages that will accrue 
from coordination of scientific investigations 
contributing to the BIOMASS programme;

(b) to provide support in the form of adequate 
facilities (ships, personnel, finance) for research 
institutions and/or agencies specializing in 
biological oceanographic research in Antarctica 
to enable such institutions and/or agencies to 
take an active part in preparing for and carrying 
out the international multidisciplinary First 
International Biomass Experiment (FIBEX) and 
Second International Biomass Experiment (SIBEX) 
planned for 1980 and 1983 respectively;

(c) to make available on vessels operating in the 
Antarctic, other than research vessels contributing 
directly to the BIOMASS programme, time and 
facilities for routine observations aimed at 
extending the data base for the programme;

(d) to have regard to the scientific advantages that 
will accrue from integrating, insofar as is 
practicable, research vessel programmes with 
commercial fishing operations.
