COMMENTS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS
SYSTEM (GTS) AS A MEANS OF PASSING ANTARCTIC DATA FROM
AND BACK TO ANTARCTICA

Annexes A (surface data) and B (upper-air data) give
the frequency that Antarctic data reaches Bracknell via the
GTS.  Bracknell is a Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC)
on the Main Trunk Circuit (MTC), and should automatically
receive any data passing between the World Meteorological
Centres (WMC) at Washington, Moscow and Melbourne.  All
main Antarctic stations are designated as part of the Basic
Global network, and consequently should all be received
at a WMC or an RMC on the Main Trunk Circuit.  Thus a test
at Bracknell is a test of the effectiveness of the MTC and
the whole GTS.

      It will be noted that the overall effectiveness for
both surface and upper-air data is the same at 29 %.  Within
this figure lie disparate success rates for different stations
depending on the route used.  Anything less than 80 % is a
failure in meteorological terms.  With a success rate of only
29 % no real dependence can be placed on the present system of
passing data through the GTS.  If however one can identify the
points of failure then it should be possible to improve the
GTS to reach an acceptable success rate.

      To identify these points of failure one needs to study
Annexe A more closely.  The principal GTS routes to the MTC
are well defined in the WMO "Implementation of the Global
Telecommunications System" (Annexe D). Alternative routes
were outlined at the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting on
Telecommunications, Buenos Aires, 1-12 September 1969.  Annexe
D modifies the details shown in Annexe II to proposal 2 of that
meeting.  In the absence of information to the contrary most
probable routes have been listed in Annexe A.
The most successful routes are via Pretoria, or Melbourne.
The Buenos Aires-Brasilia link of region III via Washington
is less successful for both Argentina and the UK, and this
link is made worse by the total failure of the Chilean input vi=
Santiago. The Soviet input via Moscow, with the exception
of Novolazarevskaya, is poor.  So too is the US input via
the McMurdo-Wellington link to Melbourne.  None of these
failures should be imputed to the lack of effort on the part
of the radio operators in Antarctica. Apart from radio-
propagation difficulties which we all experience the more
likely defects are badly timed schedules, incompatible
transmitting and receiving equipment, imprecise procedures and
format.  Any one of these factors may lead to lateness and
subsequent disregard at any of the various stages in passage
through the GTS.

The key to successful input to the GTS must therefore be:

1.  Correct timing of schedules.

2.  The use of correct frequencies appropriate to  the
    radiopath.

3.  A correct format that can be retransmitted and
    automatically switched at the main regional centres.
    The format is laid down in "The Manual on the Global
    Telecommunications System" (WMO 386) which all Antarctic
    collecting centres should have to hand.

The UK experience, through the British Antarctic Survey,
has been that efforts must be made by the controlling
organizations to match the meteorological schedules with the
requirements of the nearest RMC, and that a dialogue needs to
be established allowing flexibility of change in advertised
frequencies and/or schedule times.  Even so, BAS now finds that
only 29 % of its surface data reaches the MTC and even less
for the upper-air data.  Reported reception of Grytviken at
the nearest RTH Buenos Aires in October 1976 was more than 80 %
for schedules between 12 and 18 GMT.  It is presumably the
same for Orcades at Buenos Aires.  Night time schedules
presented greater difficulties to BAS,and until mid-1977, the
success rate was less than 20 %.  The success rate is now
better.
The disparity between reception at Buenos Aires and what has been received at Bracknell implies that the present
50 baud links from Buenos Aires direct to Washington and via
Brasilia are overloaded and until the Brasilia high speed link
is established we cannot  expect much improvement, unless
there is some rescheduling all along the GTS.

With regard to the other feeder routes it should be
noted that:

1. The Melbourne link to the MTC is still only 75 baud
and presumably some traffic has to be dumped because of
overloading or late arrival.  Reference to Annexe C
indicates some improvement and some deterioration of
data flow from the Antarctic since 1973.

2. The African route is fairly successful in terms of a
50 baud circuit.  Further improvement could be made
especially with upper-air data.

3. The direct link between Soviet Antarctic stations and
Moscow is not very effective for surface data, but
for upper air is equal to Australian stations feeding
to Melbourne.  Are, then, the Australian stations passing
the Soviet data via Melbourne?

Summary and conclusions

The four main input routes to the GTS for Antarctic data
have been briefly surveyed.  Each route has problems which
could be overcome by closer attention to schedules and
procedures. Close liaison between Antarctic national
collecting stations and the nearest RMCs is recommended.

At present, the African route is the most successful but
further improvement will probably be slow.  In time, the
Melbourne route should be the best feeder when the high speed
link is established.  Similarly, the South American link should
improve when a high speed link is established.  All three
routes could achieve at least 80 % success rate but some
rescheduling may be necessary at the input RTHs.  The Moscow
link is not very successful and the Soviet stations should, if
not already doing so, consider establishing regular Mirny or
Molodezhnaya--Melbourne and Bellingshausen--Buenos Aires links
to pass their national meteorological data on to the GTS.
Effective feedback of GTS collected Antarctic data to 
Antarctica should be considered.  It may be necessary for 
Buenos Aires, Melbourne and Pretoria to broadcasting 
special    bulletins of Collected Antarctic Data some 2-3 hours 
and again 5 hours after the observing time.
