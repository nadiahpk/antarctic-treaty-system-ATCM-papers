30 August 1977

Thank you for your letter of 10 August 1977 concerning the
possibility that an FAO representative might have an opportunity
to describe FAO programmes relevant to living resources of the
Southern Ocean to representatives of Antarctic Treaty Governments
on the occasion of the IXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
to be held in London from 19 September to 7 October 1977.

I have now been able to consult our Antarctic Treaty partners
and they have agreed that they would be prepared to meet an FAO
representative subject to the same arrangements as those adopted
on the occasion of the Preparatory Meeting held in March of this
year when Mr Popper was available for consultations which took
place informally outside the framework of the meeting.

I cannot give you any guidance on when the question of living
resources will be considered during the three weeks of the
Consultative meeting. This is a matter for the early Plenary
sessions of the Conference to decide. You might find it most
convenient in planning the time during which your representative
would be in London to consider the second week of the Conference,
that is from 26 - 30 September.

I hope this arrangement will be agreeable to you. I should
be grateful if you would, in due course, let me know who is coming
and ask him to get in touch with me on his arrival, at Church House,
Great Smith Street, Westminster, where the Consultative Meeting is
being held.
