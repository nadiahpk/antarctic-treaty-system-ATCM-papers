BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY METEOROLOGICAL BULLETINS AND               
METEOROLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION SCHEDULES               

In common with other Antarctic Treaty nations that have               
more than one station, the British Antarctic Survey operates               
a meteorological data collecting centre which then broadcasts               
regular Meteorological Bulletins containing edited national               
surface synoptic data and upper air data (Table 1).  These               
Bulletins are broadcast from Grytviken with the prime intention               
of securing entry to the GTS via the nearest RTH at Buenos               
Aires, and are at the same time for general reception in Antarctica               

Prior to the broadcast Bulletins, individual stations have               
official fixed time limit schedules with Grytviken.  These are               
listed in Table 2 under individual stations.  The stations also               
have informal international daily schedules with non-British               
stations, also listed in Table 2.  These internal Antarctic links               
must remain informal because they are subject to interruption               
by official BAS non-meteorological traffic.  The success of these               
informal links frequently depends on the enthusiasm of an individual               
operator and thus may vary from one year to the next.  Within               
this context, BAS is happy to co-operate with other Treaty nations,               
but for logistic reasons is unlikely to be in the position to               
expand or add to these schedules.  Because of these same limit-               
ations BAS is not in the position to use Grytviken, or any other               
station as a regular collecting and broadcasting station of non-               
British Antarctic data for input to the GTS, or as a regular relay               
link within Antarctica.
