Agenda Item 13

REVIEW OF CONSERVATION MEASURES AND SITES OF SPECIAL
SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

(Information document presented by the United States
Delegation)

Management plans for seven Sites of Special Scien-
tific Interest (SSSI) were accepted as interim guidelines
by Recommendation VIII-4 in 1975. The 1976-1977 austral
summer provided the first opportunity to incorporate
these guidelines into antarctic operating procedures.

The existing seven SSSI expire June 30, 1981, which
date is likely to occur before the eleventh Consultative
Meeting.

The U.S. Antarctic Program controls visits to SSSI
by a permit system and has found this to be an effective
means of reducing harmful interference at SSSI 1, 2, 3,
and 4 during the 1976-1977 operating season. The posting
of information signs around SSSI has been a deterrent
to unintended interference by tourists. During this
initial year of operations, the U.S. issued one permit
for access to SSSI. One request for access to SSSI 3
was denied on grounds that the proposed purpose was in
conflict with the Management Plan as set forth in
Recommendation VIII-4.
