INFO PAPER
ON INDEPENDENT REVIEW:

Update on South Africa's initiative to acquire ISO 14001 certification

Scope

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEA&T), under
which the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP) operates,
intends to have the SANAE IV base accredited to ISO 14001. This document
informs on the progress made to date.

Background

SANAP deals with environmental issues through its comprehensive
Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) management system. It integrates
all environmental issues with the general management of SANAP activities.

Independent Review of the Environmental Management System

SANAP supports the principle of independent review of Antarctic
activities. As part of SANAP's independent review initiatives, the South
African Bureau of Standards (SABS) was approached in August 1996. The
SABS offered to review the EHS management system with respect to
ISO 14001 requirements. Environmental aspects only were taken into
account. This review was not intended as an accreditation audit but as a first
step to identify shortcomings and inadequacies which could be addressed
before the accreditation process would be initiated.

The resulting report1 was presented to the Department and now serves
as a working document for reviewing the EHS management system. It
provides:
  •  an evaluation on each requirement of the ISO 14001 standard,
  •  a comment as to the adequacy of the EHS management system with respect
     to each ISO 14001 requirement, and
  •  recommendations regarding further work necessary to meet the ISO 14001
     requirements.

Summary of the Main Findings of the Report

All the requirements of ISO 14001 were addressed, at least at a
superficial level. Some aspects were still inadequate, though. The audit
programme was found to be comprehensive and well entrenched but follow-
ups on audit findings needed improved documentation. Responsibilities were
found to be not very clear in certain cases. Translating recommendations into

actions appeared to be shortfalling in some instances, and evidence of record 
keeping was not always adequate.

Limitations of the Evaluation

Not all relevant documents were available at the time of the evaluation, 
some documents still being in the development phase.

Future Action

The next step for South Africa is to update its EHSMS according to the 
recommendations of the review against ISO 14001. Other independent 
reviews which will be used to improve the EHSMS include:• the New Zealand 
Report on Visit to SANAE IV, Vesleskarvet, Queen Maud Land, Antarctica 
(March 1997),
• the Report of the Norwegian Antarctic Inspection Under Article VII of the 
Antarctic Treaty (December 1996), and
• the annual internal Audit Report (to be completed shortly).

Discussions with authorities on further steps, regarding the certification 
process, are currently in progress.

Conclusion

By promoting independent reviews of its Antarctic activities, SANAP now 
has ample information on how to direct and further develop its environmental 
management effort. Translating the recommendations into action appears to 
be the most important challenge.
