A Summary of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs),
Audits/Reviews and Related Documents Prepared for Activities in
Antarctica

Secretariat
Agenda Item 6(b)

The following tables list and summarise information on Initial Environmental
Evaluations (IEEs), Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs), Environmental
reviews and audits and other EIA related documents prepared to cover activities in
Antarctica.

The information in the tables is based largely on papers prepared for previous Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meetings by the United Kingdom (XVIII ATCM/Info.9, XIX
ATCM/Info.15, XXATCM/Info.8) and a subsequent update to December 1996. An
additional category of EIA related documents has been included, environmental audits
and reviews.
