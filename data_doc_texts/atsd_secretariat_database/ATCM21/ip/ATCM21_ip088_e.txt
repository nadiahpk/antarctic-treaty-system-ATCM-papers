Oil Spill Contingency Plan

Chinese Great Wall Station in Antarctica

1. Introduction

Great Wall Station was established on February 20th, 1985. It located on 
Fildes Peninsula, King Geoge Island. The whole area of the station is about 
2km long and 1km wide, in which it is a little higer in the west and a little lower 
in the east and the average slop is 3-5 degree. The area is covered by 
weathering surface and gravel. Some mose and lichens are dotted on the 
surface. There are three fresh-water lakes on the west of the station, in which 
the biggest is just behind the power building. The beach in front of the station 
is rathe flate and a peer was built there for goods transporation.
The average temperture is 1.3 °C in summer and -8 °C in winter. The gale days 
are over 60 days per year, and the highest wind-speed is 43.6 meter per 
second.
The most seen animals in great Wall Station are penguin,seal and some birds.

The general view of  Great Wall station is attached in appendix 1.

2. Oil Spill Risk Analysis.

The oil used in Great Wall Station is -10# light mixed oil, it's nature is as 
following:
        viscosity: 3.0-8.0                                   solidifying point: -10 °C

The following is oil transportation process in Great Wall Station:
The research vessel "Xue Long" transports fuel to the barge through pipe, and 
the barge takes the fuel to the dock, then pass them to the main fuel tanks by 
oil vehicle. Before it is used, the fuel vehicles then take the fuel  to a small-
size tank beside the power station and at last the fuel go to the power 
generator by pipe. And sometime when good sea conditions appears and the 
barges get near the shore, the way of pipe-transportation would be used.

Oil spill risk in Great Wall Station comes from three occasions:

2.1 Oil storage tanks
There are 8 main fuel tanks in Great Wall Station, each having the storage 
capacity of 50 tons, connected by fixed pipes, adjusted with valves. The tank 
area is covered with bed-rock, 500m away from the peer.

The main fuel tanks have no possibility to break out, so there is no possibility 
for big oil spill. The possible risk comes from the oil leak of valves and pipes 
during fuel transportation.
                                                                                
                                                  2
2.2 Power station
The small fuel tank, with capacity of 5 tons, situated out of the power station.
Fuel are taken to the fuel cabinet inside the power station by pipe. There is no 
spill possibility during the transportation, unless the slight drip in the valves.

2.3 Fuel load and unload of the barge
The possible oil spill come from the fuel  loading and unloading of the barge.
At first, fuel is put into the barge through pipe from "Xue Long" vessel, then the 
barge sails to the peer. The oil vehicle takes the fuel from the barge to the 
main fuel tanks. During this procedure, possible oil spill comes from three 
aspects:
1) Drips from connection sites of the valves;
2) Aperture on the oil pipes.
3) Wrong operation

"Xue Long" usually arrives in Great Wall Station on the end of December, with 
400 tons of fuel unloading to the oil tank. At that time ,there is no sea ice near 
Great Wall station. It usually anchors about 5Km away from the peer. The 
depth there is over 80m, so there is no possibility for the vessel to get 
grounded. When fuel is unloaded by the barge, the weather should be in 
good conditions.

oil spill source                  maximum spill estimated     possibility
tank breaking                           30 tons                  0%
drip of valves                            10kg                  0%-20%
drip of valves in power station          5Kg                   0%-20%
drip of valves during barge unloading   100Kg                  2%-20%
spill by collision of the barge          40 tons                 0%-5%

3.Effect of Oil Spill to the Environment

Because of the low temperature of Antarctica, liquid spilled oil can not 
volatilize and can even become solid. Therefore, it will exist for a long time. If it 
is not cleared out immediately, it will make harm to the environment. So, action 
should be made to avoid the harm of oil to the basic environment.

Oil spill in sea will affect the quality of sea water, especially in Antarctica. The 
low ability of self-cleaning  will result in the existing of oil for a long time, so as 
to harm the fauna and flora in sea water. Although there are no oil spill 
happened outside the Great Wall Station before, we should heighten our 
vigilance and make pre-actions to avoid the direct harm of oil spill to the 
marine creature.
4.Actions to be taken to avoid oil spill

The most effective way is to train the operators efficiently and let them know 
clearly about why the oil spill happen.

4.1 The best way is to eliminate the hidden danger of oil spill.
Every people should keep it in mind that oil spill will happen if wrong operation 
is taken.

Once there is an oil spill, the adopted measure must be based on the following:
1) The type and quantity of the spilled oil. The probable area be to spill.
2) Are there any safety problem, such as fire?
3) Oil spill will have environmental pollution. Check this area to see if there is 
any large number of active organism.
4) Record the environmental factors, such as wind speed, air temperature, 
sea condition etc., when oil spill happened.

4.2 Avoid oil spill during fuel transportation.
1). Station leader is the executive person in charge of emergency plan. He 
is responsible to all the work during the fuel transportation. Exact person 
should oversee the key part of transportation, for instance, sites of the pump, 
the valves and the pipes.

2). Station leader have to check the operators if they have known clearly 
about the operative procedure and points for attention before operation. 
Operation should not start when the operators are not sure whether or not 
everything is ok.

3). Manual of oil transportation procedure should be prepared, in which 
there should be the location and operative direction of fuel tanks, pipe and 
pump.

4). Before operation, station leader should have someone to check the 
facilities, to assure they are in good conditions. If anyone has questions about 
operative procedure and process of oil transportation, responsible person 
have to solve the problems before the operation begin.

5). Before operation, actions should be taken to prevent oil spill form risk 
areas. For instance, separating and surrounding materials should be prepared 
around possible pumps and valves. The barge should be separated by boom 
before oil unloading.

6). Station leader should have persons to check the tanks and its 
subsidiary facilities everyday, report immediately if there is any problem. And 
check all the pumps, valves and other facilities every month, to assure they 
are in good conditions. Any trouble should be resolved, bad parts should be 
mended and changed, and everything should be on record.

7). Station leader should keep all the records about oil transportation, spill 
and actions, and summit them to the archives in Chinese Polar Administration.
8) . If oil spill happened, the first action is to shut down the valves and stop the 
process. Spilled oil should be cleared out immediately. On land, spilled oil will 
be taken back by oil-absorb materials. In sea, mainly near the dock, at first,
boom should be used to prevent the oil from spreading to the sea, then take 
the oil back by using oil-absorb machine, and afterwards, treat the remains 
with dispersent.

5.Emergency Facilities for Cleaning Spilled Oil (types under selecting 
and more adding):

5.1 oil-absorb materials: cotton yarn, oil-absorb carpet

5.2 oil-absorb machine

5.3 boom

5.4 drum for the wasted oil recovered

6.Operation Guide

6.1 Station leader calls on a meeting to discuss and check the facilities before 
action
	1)	Is the pipe in good condition?
	2)	Is the pump in good condition?
	3)	Is there any drip in the valves?
	4)	Is there any safety problem?
	5)	Are the facilities for taking back spilled oil prepared?

6.2 Check the communication equipment and the frequency

6.3 Discuss with meteorological personnel, to see if the weather will turn 
bad.

6.4 Find out the change of sea tide.

6.5 Take preventing actions against possible spill place, for instance, 
preparing oil-absorb material, empty fuel drums etc.

6.6 Check the oil recovery equipment whether or not in good conditions.

6.7 There must be a special person on duty when operation. Also the 
machinist and the environmental officer must be there.

6.8 If oil spill occur, operator should be shut down the spill point immediately.

6.9 Environmental officer and machinist should make report to station leader 
on time and adopt measure.

5
6.10 For oil spill in different cases, the first consideration is to collect oil by 
mechanical method or leave itself natural volatilizing; usually, chemical 
dispersent is not the first consideration to use, especially at the sea ,to prevent 
from the second round pollution; if safety is threatened by the oil spill. But in 
the later case it is the recommended method to use.

6.11 The station leader is responsible for direct the clean-up operation.

6.12 Environmental officer should take evidence of the accident by sampling 
on spill site  and take video or photo as well.

6.13 After clean-up, station leader with environmental officer and machinist 
should check the spill area carefully.

6.14 Station leader with environmental officer and machinist must analyze the 
oil spill and make special report to the Chinese Polar Administration, State 
Ocean Administration.

7. Personnel Training

Skilled operators are important for preventing from oil spill. So, the operators 
should be trained and let them understand oil spill is extremely harmful to the 
Antarctic environment, fauna and flora.

7.1 The Chinese Polar Administration should give the expedition team 
courses on Antarctic environment protection before going to Antarctica, 
providing each with a brochure of environment protection regulations.

7.2 The station leader should hand over oil delivery and storage equipment, 
arrange dedicated operator to be familiar with equipment rapidly after the 
expedition team arrives in station.

7.3 At least a pre-exercise should be arranged so as to check how well the 
operators grasp equipment. Unqualified personnel should be trained further. 
Do not arrange unqualified people to operate equipment.

7.4 Operator personnel must grasp the following:
      1) type of oil in station;
      2) operator procedure of oil tank truck, pump and valve;
      3) usage of HF telephone and communication channel;
      4) storage location of recovered equipment for oil spill;
      5) method to deploy oil-round-fence for collecting spilled oil;
      6) how to use oil absorber;
      7) property and usage of anti-oil agent

8. Organization And Personnel
8.1 The Chinese Polar Administration, State Oceanic Administration is responsible for preventing from, and clearing of oil spill, and is also in charge of making, supplementing and revising oil spill contingency plan, providing with updating contingency equipment, and personnel training.

8.2 The Chinese Polar Administration appoints the station leader to be responsible for oil delivery on land. Dedicated personnel should be responsible for oil delivery and oil spill clearance. The station leader gives instructions on oil spill clearance, reporting to the Chinese Polar Administration.

8.3 The captain or dedicated persons are responsible for oil delivery from "Xue Long" to barge , conducting clearance of oil spill around "Xue Long" .

8.4 The station leader assigns a mechanic to be responsible for oil delivery, his main responsibilities are:
	1) check oil pumps and valves, keeping them in good state;
	2) check whether the pipeline joints right or not;
	3) check whether the operators can keep in good communications each other while loading or unloading oil;
	4) check whether necessary measures for preventing oil from spill have been taken;
	5) take measures to shut down the source of oil spill immediately in the event of oil spill;
	6) report to the station leader immediately in the event of oil spill

8.5 The station leader designates an environmental officer to be responsible for clearance of oil spill, his responsibilities are:
	1) decide on practical measures for disposal of oil spill;
	2) be in charge of deploying boom;
	3) operate oil absorber properly;
	4) give instructions on how to use anti-oil agent ,
	5) report to the station leader about clearance of oil spill;
	6) take video or photos of oil spill area;
	7) collect samples of soil, flora and organism (if any) around oil spill area;
	8) monitor impact to the environment due to the oil spill.

9. Communication

The station leader and each operator must be provided with a HF telephone before oil delivery, with communication channel on 12. While refueling, all HF telephone should be always kept ON in order operators can get in touch with each other at any time. Once oil spill occurs, operators must be notified immediately, taking measures to shutdown the source of oil spill.
10. Reporting about Oil Spill Incident

The operators should report to the station leader as soon as possible in the event of oil spill. The leader must report to the Chinese Polar Administration within 24 hours. The report is to describe:

1). time, place and cause of oil spill;
2). location, type of oil, estimated quantity of fuel spilled (in liter);
3). local meteorological condition when oil spill occurs;
4). response action taken, clean-up techniques used for clearance of oil spill and results;
5). primary assessment of oil spill harming to the Antarctic environment.

11. Oil Spill Waste Treatment

11.1 treatment of recovered waste oil: Load recovered waste oil into designated oil tanks, store them in proper location in order to load to ship for later treatment.

11.2 Combustible absorbents to be burnt in incinerator.

11.3 Put incombustible absorbents' material into containers, to be shipped back for treatment.

11.4 Pile all waste material in designated containers, avoiding second round contamination.
