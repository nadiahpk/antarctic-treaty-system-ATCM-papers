MULTIDISCIPLINARY GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR FILDES 
PENINSULA, KING GEORGE ISLAND, ANTARCTICA

Ricardo Jaña1 and Laura Encina2

SUMMARY

The characteristics, potential and state of development of the information tool that the 
"Instituto Antartico Chileno" (INACH), is implementing for the area of Fildes Peninsula, 
King George island, South Shetland archipelago, are described.

The Geographic Information System (GIS) that is being built, will administer -spatially 
georeferenced- data of geographic features, facilities, and those data of scientific and 
environmental nature, permitting the consultation, update, modelling and decision-making, 
based on procedures executed on the multidisciplinary information there contained.

In this way, the tasks associated with the execution of the Antarctic Treaty regulations on the 
protection of the antarctic environment and other of scientific character, are attended.

INTRODUCTION

A great number of the Antarctic Treaty System standing group Recommendations, 
and particularly those that will be in force when the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on 
Protection of the Environment (Madrid Protocol) takes effect, impose to the countries 
members the need to manage  a varied group of information in order to be able to implement 
such regulations.

In this context, it has been pointed out, among other antecedents, that the use of the 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an efficient strategy for supporting environmental 
management efforts (Harris, 1993), and they provide a platform of appropriate information 
for the logistic support necessary to assist the research in the Antarctica (Rossi, 1996).

Aware of this problems, the Instituto Antartico Chileno (INACH), is developing the 
implementation of a multidisciplinary SIG for Fildes Peninsula. This information tool 
considers the incorporation and managing of scientific, logistic and environmental 
information, in one of the geographic areas of the Antarctic continent where our country 
develops projects of scientific and technological research, monitoring programs, maintaining 
permanent facilities, all of which works like a center of distribution and logistic support 
towards other sectors of the Antarctic Peninsula, due to the facilities that it provides.

The use by the Fildes SIG of a base cartography to adequate scales - 1:1.000 and 
1: 5.000 - and the adoption of technical standards suggested by SCAR in order to code the 
information, which facilitates its transfer, responds to the suggestions that have been 
formulated to this respect as key aspects towards this class of application in Antarctica.

To Fildes Peninsula area, the SIG utility and potentiality are reaffirmed upon 
considering that there other countries also develop activities, configuring a multinational 
settlement that makes an intensive use of that geographical space, with an important human 
intervention in a sensitive and fragile environment. So, into the cooperative action scope it is 
also considered that the implementation of this platform of information will be a contribution 
for the international community that develops activities and maintains settlements in the area.

FILDES SIG DESIGN

The objectives formulated for the GIS development aim to satisfy the tasks of 
administration, representation and integration of multidisciplinary information relative to the 
geographic area of Fildes Peninsula, King George island, South Shetland islands, with the 
purpose of supporting the scientific , logistic and environmental protection activities that are 
carried out in the zone.

Towards this aim, the specification of a model of the reality has been considered. In 
it information is structured and organized in thematic coverages. These coverages group to 
closed-by elements are spatially represented in vectorial form through points, arcs and

polygons, and they are associated to their corresponding attributes that describe them 
through relationships among tabular databases. The SIG also considers data incorporation in 
raster format, as it is the case of the satellite images and the representation of graphic files, 
such as photographs and scanned facilities plans.

The base cartography used is constituted in a first term for digital cartography to 
scale 1:5.000. This was carried out by the Instituto Geografico Militar (IGM) of the Chilean 
Army through the execution of a shared project with INACH. In their elaboration geodesic 
techniques of satellital positioning were used to perform the ground control, as well as, the 
use of the DGPS method for the acquisition of other geographical and cultural elements 
considered. For the sector where the Chilean facilities are concentrated an 1:1.000 digital 
cartography is also available. This was surveyed in 1984 by the Servicio Aerofotogramtrico 
(SAF) of the Chilean Air Force and it was recently digitalized by INACH. This information 
is referred in a coordinate system of UTM cartographic projection, 21 zone and WGS84 
datum.

In a first stage the database structure considers the following organization of 
thematic coverages: Control Points, Contour, Spot Heights, Hydrography, Geology, 
Physiography, Glaciology, Hydrology, Flora, Fauna, Protected Areas Boundary, Routes, 
Facilities, Networks, Fuel, Intervened Places, Monitoring Stations, Marks and Geographic 
Names.

Each thematic coverage contains close-by features spatially referenced which, in 
order to permitting the efficient information exchange, are geocoded under technical 
standards. In general, the design of each coverage has an attribute table of the represented 
features, permiting its relationship with other antecedents maintained in computational files, 
such as plans, digitalized pictures, etc.

It is noted that through the definition of additional attribute tables (lookup tables)
one could relate the geocodes with text and appropriate symbols for their representation.

As an implementation platform the software Arc/Info v. 7.03 is used, which is 
installed in a Workstation HP Apollo 9000/715 running under UNIX 9.03operating system.

This Workstation is connected to a local area network that permits access to the data server 
of the Information System of Scientific Antarctic Data (SIDCA), possibiliting the 
establishment of relationships with databases administered by the ORACLE RDBMS tool. 
The software ArcView is also available as a tool of integration, visualization and 
consultation of the data which facilitates significantly the access for a special group of users.

CAPTURE OF INFORMATION METHODS USED

The load process of the SIG database considered in the first term the conversion of 
the digital cartography 1:5.000. This was generated by IGM in IGDS format using 
InterGraph software and their IGDS information levels transformed to an Arc/Info format 
considering the coverage structure specified in the design.

For the information at 1:1.000 scale coming from the SAF a procedure was elected 
in which the 19 sheets that compose that cartography were scanned to 400 dpi, then they 
were registered on a control points coverage and later vectorized in a semiautomatic form 
using the ArcScan module of Arc/Info. The steps followed in this pixel-level image 
vectorization, allowing to diminish the errors caused by traditional digitalization of 
cartographies, are summarized in Figure 1.

In relation to elements not mapped in the previously elaborated cartographies, it has 
been used the Diferencial GPS method in order to acquire them. This strategy will be used 
during the successive ground campaigns in order to incorporate new elements and 
modernize the information.

For the tabular database definition tools of the Arc/Info software have been used, 
supplementing the attribute tables of the geographic features with additional attributes for 
each coverage, as well as, new tables have been created in order to facilitate the standarized 
representation of the information.

STATE OF THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT

Up to date results obtained in the development of the SIG for Fildes could be 
synthetized in the materialization of the next activities, as follows:

- training and experience in the use of the software tools used
- GIS conceptual design
- load of the 90% of the geographic features of the specified coverages
- load of the 50% of the attributes that describe features

The current implementation tasks are refered to validate the information loaded, to 
acquire lacking features and to survey at Fildes Peninsula information of attributes during 
the summer season of 1996-97. Also, in order to integrate information, relationship tests are 
carried out over GIS's loaded features with scientific databases (ORACLE tables) 
administered by the SIDCA.

At present, it is possible to obtain graphic outputs, like that attached, and it has been 
considered that at the end of 1997, there will be a platform of information allowing to 
complete the stated objectives.
