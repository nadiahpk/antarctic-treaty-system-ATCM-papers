ABSTRACT

Twenty rabbits were studied divided into five groups, each one of four animals. Group I (control) was fed with a balanced diet. The other groups were fed with an hypercholesterolemic diet during three months. The diet of Group II was supplemented with 10% of krill, containing 150 mg of W-3 fatty acids. Groups II and III were sacrificed after 3 months. At the end of this period and during three more months, Group IV received a balanced diet and Group V received a balanced diet plus krill.

Collagen of Types I, III, IV and VII was detected with specific monoclonal antiserums (Chemstron) which recognized the same epitopes in the rabbits' collagen. The final detection was carried out with estreptavidine-biotin-peroxidase. Sections of the aorta were studied in the control group to get the collagen distribution, that was similar to the one found in sections of human aorta obtained by necropsy of two patients of less than 30 years of age who had died of traumatic causes. Collagen I showed positive staining in the middle layer, similar to collagen VII and a small amount of collagen IV, located in the basal endothelium membrane. Collagen III seemed to be located mainly in the adventitia.

In the thickening with lipofages at the sub-endothelial level, that constitute the atheroma's plates in the initial stage of the development, the collagen present is mainly that of Type II in Groups II and III. En the fully developed plates of the animals in Group V, collagen of Type IV appeared surrounding the muscle cells and fibers that have proliferated. The plates show an homogeneous texture, without layers. On the other hand, mature plates on animals of Group IV show layers, with small amounts of collagen III and great amounts of collagen I, more stable metabolically. Collagen VII did not show in any of the plates of the experimental animals.

In conclusion, w-3 fatty acids contained in the krill, among other substances, do modify the collagenogenesis in the healing phase of the atheroma's plates, leaving an homogeneous plate rich in collagen III, less stable and with more possibilities of an "at integrum" recovery.

INTRODUCTION

International studies have showed that populations that feed basically on sea food are the ones that show less cardiovascular morbimortality and this has been linked, among other things, to the content of w-3 fatty acids of those products (1.2).

Antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) is a sea product that modifies the development of atheroma's plates at the arterial level and its experimental regression on rabbits fed with a hypercholesterolemic diet. These modifications can be seen during the development of a plate with a interstitial matrix of thin and amorphous fibers related to collagen recently deposited and, during the regression, there is no dense fibrosis and there appears a matrix of alcianofile material (3).

2
Based on these qualitative modifications, the aim of this study is to determine the 
collagenic characteristics of these plates in both situations, development and regression 
of the atherogenic process and thus understand better the process and the effects of the 
sea products on the atherogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals used

24 New Zealand albino rabbits of 2, 5 and 3 kg were used and divided in 5 groups with 
different diets:

Group I: 4 animals on a balanced diet for rabbits (Villamil S.A., Montevideo, Table I).

Group II: 4 animals on a balanced diet enriched with 1% cholesterol w/w.

Group III: 4 animals on a balanced diet and krill at 10% w/w, enriched with 1% 
cholesterol w/w.

Group IV: 4 animals on a balanced diet that had previously received during 12 weeks a 
diet enriched with 1% cholesterol w/w.

Group V: 4 animals on a balanced diet and krill at 10% w/w, that had previously 
received during 12 weeks a balanced diet enriched with 1% cholesterol w/w.

All the diets were fed as pellets and water "ad libitum". After 12 weeks of starting with 
the diets, all animals were sacrificed.

Chemical Studies of the Diets

On all 4 types of diet [I) balanced diet, II) balanced diet enriched with 1% cholesterol 
w/w, III) balanced diet and krill at 10% w/w, enriched with 1% cholesterol w/w and IV) 
balanced diet and krill at 10% w/w], the following studies were carried out: humidity, 
proteins, lipids, cholesterol, ashes and fatty acids content, specially those of the w-3 
series.

The percentage of humidity was obtained by double weighing, until constant post-drying 
weight. Proteins were studied by the Kjeldahl method (4) and lipids were extracted by 
the Folch method, chloroform-methanol 2:1 (v/v) (5), evaluating the total content by 
weighing, having previously evaporated the solvent.

The content of fibers was estimated through the loss of weight due to ignition of the dry 
residue that remained of an acid digestion (4). Ashes were calculated by the calcination 
method. Total cholesterol (TC) was estimated on part of the lipidic extract obtained by 
the Folch method, and TC was calculated by the enzymatic method of cholesterol with 
oxidase-peroxidase (6).
The evaluation of fatty acids was carried out on part of the lipidic extract having 
previously methylated with trifluoride of boron-methanol (Sigma) (7).

As standards and subject to the same methylation treatment, the following were used 
miristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), estearic acid 
(C18:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), behenic acid (C22:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid 
(C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), eicosaenoic acid (C20:1), eicosadienoic acid (C20:2), 
eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5) 
and those of the w-3 series, octadecatetraenoic acid (ODA) (C18:4Δ,6,9,12,15), 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5Δ,5,8,11,14,17) and doxahaxaenoic acid (DHA) 
(C22:6Δ,4,7,10,13,16,19) (8), all of them Sigma products.

Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Hitachi 263-50 gas chromatograph, in 
glass column of 2mmx3mm of DI, packed with diethylen-glycol succinate at 15% on a 
Uniport B (Gosojuro Konya) 60/80 net, at a temperature of 185°C with a flux speed of 
45 ml/min of N2 and ionization flame detector. The estimation of each fatty acid was 
carried out by calculating the areas using the computer integrated module (cromatopac) 
of Shimadzu, model C-RSA.

Biochemical Studies

Blood samples were extracted by cardiac paracentesis of all the animals, separating the 
serum by centrifugation and storing it at -20°C until their analysis.

TC were estimated by the enzymatic method (6), triglycerides (TG) by the enzymatic 
method (9) and cholesterol linked to the high density lipoproteins (HDL-C) by selective 
precipitation according to the Lopez Virella technique (10). The cholesterol not linked to 
the HDL (non HDL-C) was estimated by difference: non HDL-C = TC - HDL-C (11).

Immunological, Histological and Chemical Analysis

The aortas of all rabbits and the thorax and abdominal sections of human aortas obtained 
by necropsy of two patients younger than 30 years old who died of traumatic causes, 
were stained in buffered formalin at 10% to include them in paraffin. To detect the 
collagen, cuts of 6 microns deep were made and located in silanized plaques treated with 
a buffered citrate in microwave oven and followed by trypsinization.

Collagens I, II, III, IV and VII were detected on this material using specific monoclone 
antiserums (Chemtron). Final detection was carried out with estreptavidine-biotin-
peroxidase with AEC as chromogen (12). In the 6 microns cuts the following staining 
was carried out: Hemalum-Eosine, PAS-Alcian Blue with diastastic digestion, Orceine 
for elastic and Wildeer for fibers (13).

Other aorta sections carried out with freezing microtome were stained with Oil Red O-
Hemalum to see the cells with lipidic content.

Statistical Analysis

The diets results are showed as x̄ of the quadruple estimates carried out for each case.

For all values, the statistical significance of Student's Test was used to compare the non paired groups (14).

RESULTS

Diets

Table II shows the composition of the different diets. There are no modifications in the global contents of proteins and lipids in any of them nor in the carbohydrates content, that correspond to the difference in the 100% of the diet. The values were 50.09; 48.70; 47.43 and 46.64 g/100 g respectively in diets I, II, III and IV.

Table III shows the composition of the diets' fatty acids. The difference to point out is the one that corresponds to the w-3 fatty acids content. The diets with krill (diets III and IV) contain 132-164mg/100 g of food, and there are no w-3 fatty acids in the diets without krill (diets I and II).

Lipid Analysis in Plasma

The lipid analysis in plasma (Table IV) show that TC increased significantly (p<0,001) in groups II and III in relation to group I, at the expense of the non HDL-C. Groups IV and V returned to their basal values (group I).

Immunological, Histological and Chemical Analysis

The distribution of collagens in the aorta of the control group (I) was similar to the one found in sections of human aorta. Collagen I showed a moderate positive staining in the middle layer, similar to that of collagen VII and some collagen IV. This last one showed at the endothelial basal membrane. Collagen III seemed to be located mainly at the adventitia.

At the thickening with lipofages at the sub-endothelial level that forms the atheroma's plates in the development's initial stages of groups II and III, the collagen present was mainly the one corresponding to type III (Figure 1) with less content in group III (diet enriched with cholesterol plus krill), and the collagen VII kept its positive staining in the middle layer (Figure 2).

During the process' regression in the plates of the animals of group V (Figure 3) only collagen IV is added surrounding the muscle cells and fibers that have proliferated. The plates show and homogeneous non-layered textures. On the other hand, the plates of the animals of group IV show a fibrous cap, layered, with small amounts of collagen III and great amounts of collagen I (Figure 4).

Collagen VII was not present in the plates of any of the experimental animals

## COMMENTARIES AND DISCUSSION

The distribution of the different types of collagen in the normal vessels walls is similar both in rabbits and humans. Antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) is a crustacean rich in w-3 fatty acids (15) that produces modifications in the atherogenesis when fed 140-160mg/day every 3 kg of animal weight. These modifications show a smaller collagen plate and the main collagen is that of type III, as well as a less lipid content (1,2).

Everything happens as if the natural development of the plate at its "ad integrum" recovery accelerated in the absence of a massive concentration of lipofages and the fibergenesis of the smooth muscle cells.

The plate's regression if also different in the animals that received a supplement of krill (group V) in relation to the ones fed only with the balanced diet (group IV). In the animals of group IV a peculiar layered structure can be seen on the plates, with a dense fibrous nucleus and similar fibrous caps formed mainly of collagen 1 (Figure 4).

The presence of collagen 1, dense and non alcianofile, indicates a more difficult remodelation (16).

On the other hand, in the animals of group V, in addition to a less amount of lipids and lipofages (1-3), there appears a matrix rich in alcianofile material formed by collagen III, with a superficial proliferation of muscle cells that form a more adequate matrix for the recovery when it substitutes (17) the fibrous cap (collagen 1) found in the animals of group IV (18).

As the Antarctic krill is a complex product, the modifications produced in the collagenogenesis during the healing phase of the atheroma's plate that maintains an homogeneous plate with collagen III, less stable and easier to remodelate, must not be attributed solely to the content of w-3 fatty acids (19) and their anti-inflammatory and immunological properties (20), but also to other substances that may have a possible protection role in the atherogenesis, such as oleic acid, selenium, zinc, magnesium and astazantines among others (21,22).
