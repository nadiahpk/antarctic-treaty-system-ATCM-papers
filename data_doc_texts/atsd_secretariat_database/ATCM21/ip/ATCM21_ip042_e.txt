STATEMENT BY THE REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMISSION (IOC)
ATCM-XXI, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND, 19-30 MAY 1997

The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) was founded in 1960 within
UNESCO. The Commission has functional autonomy within UNESCO and serves the
members of the UN family in their implementation of joint programmes relating to ocean
research and observations. From the Commission's 125 Member States, two thirds are
developing countries. The Commission implements programmes within three subject areas:
    Marine Sciences;
    Ocean Services;
    and Training, Education and Mutual Assistance/Capacity Building.

● In 1967, the IOC established the Intergovernmental Committee for the Southern Ocean (IOC-
SOC) in order to promote and coordinate oceanographic observations and research in the
Southern Ocean.

In 1992, the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED)
called on the IOC to take a lead in establishing the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).
GOOS aims to meet the needs
    (i) for forecasting climate variability and change;
    (ii) for assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources, including
        the coastal zone; and
    (iii) for supporting an improved decision-making and management processes which take
        into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on
        human health and resources.

In 1993, a comprehensive report called "The Southern Ocean: A review of Activities in
Relation to IOC Programmes " was issued and was made available to ATCM.

● The IOC Assembly held a Southern Ocean Forum in conjunction with the sixth session of the
IOC Committee for the Southern Ocean, and accepted the invitation of the Director of the
Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research to have the first session of the
Forum and the sixth session of the Committee in Bremerhaven, Germany, from 9 to 13
September 1996. The Forum provided an opportunity to scientists and operators working
under the UN system, the Antarctic Treaty system or the International Council of Scientific
Unions to share common views and formulate joint actions for the benefit of all Member
States in investigation and exploration of the Southern Ocean.

The proposals of the Forum were subsequently considered by the sixth session of the IOC
Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean, with a view to formulating draft
recommendations on the future IOC Activities in the Southern Ocean. The IOC Executive
Council at its twenty-ninth session (24 September- 4 October 1996) acted to redefine the role
of the IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean, because of the great changes in the
appreciation of the scientific importance of the Southern Ocean, since the IOC Committee for
the Southern Ocean was established in 1967.

SIXTH SESSION OF THE IOC REGIONAL COMMITTEE FOR THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

The Sixth Session of the IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean held in Bremerhaven, Germany, 12-13 September 1996. In the Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean, 10 Member States were present, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, Russia, South Africa, UK and the USA, as well as representatives of WMO, WCRP, IWC, COMNAP and ICSU/SCOR. It was regretted that SCAR was not able to

TWENTY-NINTH SESSION OF THE IOC EXECUTIVE COUNCIL

The IOC Executive Council noted that the First Southern Ocean Forum reviewed present knowledge, gaps and needs for future ocean research and related services in the Southern Ocean, as well as the international framework for cooperation. IOC Executive Council emphasised that the Southern Ocean is unique in its physical and biological characteristics; that its study is of great importance for understanding of the world's climate and climate change, as well as for the global cycling of carbon and other elements; and that it is a potential source of marine living resources. IOC Executive Council approved the recommendations of the Sixth Session of the IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean. In view of the many important developments of great relevance to the Southern Ocean that have occurred since the establishment of the IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean in 1967, the IOC Executive Council decided to revise the terms of reference of the IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean by Resolution EC-XXIX.6 "Southern Ocean Forum and Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean," to better reflect the present role of the Committee in view of those developments.

Election of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the IOC-SOC

The IOC-SOC unanimously elected Dr Max Tilzer, Director of the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, as the Chairman of the Committee. The IOC-SOC agreed not to elect a Vice-Chairman but rather to create an advisory group to advise and assist the Chairman.

The composition of the advisory group, as agreed by the Committee, is:
Mr. Carlos Daniel Carbone (Argentina)
Dr. John Church (Australia)
Dr. Alexander Klepikov (Russia)
Dr. Eric Lindstrom (USA)
Dr. Julian Priddle (UK)
The group will work mainly by correspondence (via Internet).
