50TH ANNIVERSARY OF

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ANTARCTIC RESEARCH EXPEDITIONS

Submitted by the Delegation of Australia

In 1997 Australia celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Australian National 
Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE).

ANARE commenced in 1947/48 with an expedition to Heard Island and Macquarie 
Island where stations were established for the 1948 winter. The Macquarie Island 
station has been continuously occupied since that time. The Heard Island station 
was closed in 1955, following the establishment of Mawson, which is the oldest 
continuously occupied station south of the Antarctic Circle. Subsequently, Davis 
station was established for the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Casey station 
was opened in 1969, replacing Wilkes which had been passed from the US to 
Australia's administrative control after the IGY.

Australia currently maintains Mawson, Davis and Casey as permanent stations in 
the Antarctic Treaty area, as well as the station on subantarctic Macquarie Island.

For the large and diverse community that has made up ANARE over the last 50 
years, the 1997 Jubilee is a chance to celebrate Australia's involvement in this 
increasingly important part of the globe.

The Australian Antarctic Division is coordinating a number of events in 1997 to 
recognise the occasion and invites representatives from Australia's Treaty partners 
to join the celebration.

•	The ANARE-Jubilee History: The Silence Calling

This comprehensive history of the Australian Antarctic program, researched and 
written by Tim Bowden, was sponsored by the Australian Antarctic Division. Over 
600 pages long and illustrated throughout, it is to be published by Allen & Unwin 
in June 1997. The Silence Calling will be an important source of information on 
Australians in the Antarctic.

•	Television documentary: The Silence Calling

Supported by the Australian Antarctic Division and produced by the Australian 
Broadcasting Corporation, this 75-minute documentary narrated by Tim Bowden 
features rarely seen film from the early years of ANARE, with interviews of major 
players in modern ANARE. In exploring the history of the Australian Antarctic 
program, it touches on some fascinating possibilities for the future. The 
documentary is to be broadcast on ABC-TV in June 1997.

Jubilee Science Symposium

This major ANARE Jubilee event, in Hobart from 20 to 23 July 1997, celebrates 50 
years of ANARE science with addresses and papers exploring aspects of Australia's 
Antarctic research programs over the past half-century and looking ahead to 2000 
and beyond. It will feature contributions from prominent ANARE scientists and 
administrators, including the first director of the Australian Antarctic Division, Dr 
Phillip Law. Antarctic scientists from around the world are invited to participate.

ANARE Jubilee Photographic Exhibition

From the very first Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947, 
photography has been important in documenting the history of Australia's 
Antarctic research programs. An exhibition of 200 Antarctic photographs, with 
special emphasis on historical pictures, opened on 1 May 1997 at Australia's 
Parliament House in Canberra. The display will be open to the public throughout 
May. It will move to Hobart in June, Sydney in August and Melbourne in October.

Jubilee Antarctic Garden

A small piece of land at the ANARE headquarters in Hobart has been set aside for a 
garden of exclusively southern hemisphere plants derived from those which 
flourished in Antarctica when it was the centrepiece of Gondwana, since 
fragmented into several land masses including Australia and South America. The 
Antarctic garden is open to the public.

Other events

There will be a number of other events to mark the Jubilee, including various 
publications, the production of postage stamps, and a midwinter dinner in Hobart 
on 21 June 1997.
