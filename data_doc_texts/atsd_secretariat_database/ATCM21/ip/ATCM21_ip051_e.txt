INTRODUCTION OF DISEASE INTO ANTARCTIC BIRDS

Australian research in the Antarctic indicates that penguins at some locations have been exposed to a virus that causes serious disease in poultry chicks. The research has discovered serological evidence of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) in Adelie and emperor penguins. IBDV increases susceptibility in chicks to other infections and reduces growth rates. These subtle effects can impact on the long term survival of a species. It may also cause high rates of death amongst chicks. Whilst the presence of IBDV is of specific concern, its discovery highlights other issues:

• There is an increasing risk of disease being introduced into the fauna because of the increase in the numbers of people travelling to and within Antarctica.

• There is a need to develop measures to limit introductions and to control outbreaks.

Research carried out by the Australian Antarctic program in the 1994/95 and 1995/96 austral summer seasons led to the discovery of evidence of IBDV in penguins in the vicinity of Mawson station. Antibodies to a pathogenic form of IBDV have been found in blood samples from penguins in the vicinity of Mawson but not in the less visited area of Edmonson Point in the Ross Sea. The Australian research is summarised in the attached paper published in Nature on 15 May 1997.

The biological significance of IBDV in Adelie and emperor penguins is not known at this stage. It is a serious disease of poultry causing immune deficiency and/or death in chicks. The impact of this disease in an immunologically naïve population of birds could range from reduced productivity of the birds to local extinction of the species.

IBDV is one of the most resistant poultry viruses and its characteristics lead to rapid spread and persistence in the environment. The epidemiology of a disease as it relates to the basic ecology of Antarctic birds is not well known. This lack of knowledge combined with the difficulty of managing access to bird colonies present challenges to the formulation of effective mechanisms to limit the spread of exotic disease. The presence of antibodies to IBDV raises the need to monitor the effects and progress of diseases, and address the increasing risk posed by the introduction of exotic organisms to Antarctic fauna.

Little is known about disease in birds or mammals in Antarctica. The extent of the information on birds is limited to a few anecdotal reports of disease, a few reports of mass mortality in penguins and only three epidemiological surveys of disease. Many avian pathogens can contaminate poultry meat and eggs and food products containing these substances. Cooking and freezing does not necessarily kill them. Newcastle Disease, tuberculosis, and yeast infection pathogens are only a few of the micro-organisms that can be carried in poultry and associated products.

The evidence of IBDV in penguins raises concerns about the spread of disease to and around the continent and could imply that human activity plays a role in the distribution of viruses in Antarctica. The fauna and flora of Antarctica are no longer protected from disease by distance or absence of human contact. The importation of frozen food, extensive use of air travel to Antarctica and within the region has removed the barrier of distance which would have prevented exotic pathogens surviving. The large number of people visiting Antarctica has increased the risk of the entry of a foreign pathogen. In the austral summer of 1994 in excess of 8,000 people visited the Antarctic Peninsula with 20 sites in this region receiving more than 500 visitors - visitor numbers can be expected to increase.

Apart from the risk of introducing alien diseases, the movement of people from one bird (or seal) colony to another also increases the risk of spreading naturally occurring (endemic) diseases. While there are provisions for reducing the risk of the introduction of exotic disease there is little awareness of the need to address the spread of endemic diseases. The traditional quarantine measures to prevent the spread of diseases, or to respond to an outbreak of disease, would be difficult or impossible to implement in the Antarctic environment. There are no conventional borders to control the movement of people. No strategies have been developed to address the outbreak of disease.

The research conducted by Australia into the spread of exotic and endemic pathogens highlights the need for consideration of:

·  priorities for research into diseases in birds in Antarctica
·  development and implementation of disease monitoring programs
·  development of principles for a contingency plan for the outbreak of disease
·  procedures to limit the risk of introduction of disease, and its spread through out Antarctica, including
   —  raising visitor awareness of the potential for the importation of exotic disease and the spread of endemic disease
   —  mechanisms to control access to colonies of birds
   —  improved controls on the use of poultry products in Antarctica.

The Australian Antarctic Division intends to take further action to investigate the incidence and management of disease in Antarctic wildlife. It will be convening a workshop of relevant experts in epidemiology, biology and wildlife ecology to consider options for monitoring and managing responses to the disease. It invites other Treaty parties to contribute advice and expertise on the potential for introduction of diseases in Antarctic wildlife, future research requirements, preventative measures and approaches to dealing with an outbreak of disease.

Poultry virus infection in Antarctic penguins

(Text from article published in the magazine 'Nature', 15 May 1997.)

Antarctic penguins appear to be relatively free of infectious diseases, 
although there is serological evidence of infection with a number of avian 
diseases found elsewhere1-4. An infectious agent is suspected in one case of 
mass mortality in Adélie penguin chicks Pygoscelis adeliae 5, but there have 
been no confirmed reports of any major outbreaks of infectious disease. 
Here we report evidence for the occurrence of an avian pathogen, infectious 
bursal disease virus (IBDV), in wild Antarctic penguins. This raises concern 
for the conservation of avian wildlife in Antarctica (Fig. 1).

IBDV is a pathogen of domestic chickens, Gallus domesticus , but antibodies 
have been detected in a variety of wild aquatic bird species6. It affects 
lymphoid organs, primarily the bursa of Fabricius in chicks, the main site 
for the development of antibody-producing B-lymphocytes populations. 
Subclinical effects and immuno-suppression caused by even the less 
virulent strains of IBDV, retard growth and development, and predispose 
the chick to opportunistic infections7. Morbidity and mortality rates in 
young chickens vary but can be high, especially in a newly emerged, globally 
spreading, high virulence strain.

We inferred IBDV infection from the presence of specific antibodies in 
serum collected from both emperor Aptenodytes forsteri and Adélie 
penguins. We collected samples from 52 emperor penguin fledgling chicks 
(four to five months of age) from Auster Rookery (67o 23'S 64o 02'E) in 
December 1995, and between September 1995 and February 1996 from 133 
adult Adélie penguins from two colonies, within 40 km of Mawson (67o 
31'S 62o 48'E) (Fig. 2). We used a standard virus neutralisation test (VNT) 
to measure antibody titres8. Antibody titres of 1 in 80 or greater were 
regarded as positive9. Using this conservative criterion, the prevalence of 
positive VNT reactors was 65.4% in emperor penguin chicks and 2.1% and 
2.6% in the two colonies of adult Adélie penguins. Infection with IBDV 
occurs principally in young birds10, and so prevalence of seroreactors would 
decline with age.

We found no antibodies in Adélie serum taken from either chicks (n=17) or 
adult birds (n=26) in January 1996 from a remote and rarely visited colony at 
Edmonson Point (74o 21' S 165o 03'E) in the Ross Sea (Fig.2). In a 
retrospective analysis, the prevalence of antibodies in adult Adélie penguin 
serum collected at Mawson in January 1991 was 1.5% (n=136).

IBDV is relatively resistant to inactivation by heat, desiccation and chemical 
agents, and is contagious and highly infectious by the faecal-oral route11. It is 
likely to remain an environmental contaminant of colonies between

breeding seasons. The recent rapid spread of the new highly virulent strains 
throughout most of the poultry industry in the northern hemisphere is 
testament to its potential for widespread dissemination. A potent source of 
environmental contamination in Antarctica could be from careless or 
inappropriate disposal of poultry products, allowing access by scavenging 
birds such as the south polar skua Catharacta maccormicki. Spread within 
Antarctica could be facilitated through the movement of people carrying the 
virus on contaminated footwear, clothing, equipment or vehicles.

Although clinical disease was not apparent in either species of penguin, 
further investigation is warranted. The presence of seroreactors near centres 
of human activity raises the possibility that the virus may have been 
introduced. The size of our chick sample at Edmonson Point was sufficient 
to detect a prevalence of in excess of 20% seroreactors (p<0.05)12. If IBDV was 
present in this location, the seroprevalence would be expected to be similar 
to that among the equivalent age group of emperor chicks. Thus the absence 
of neutralising antibodies in the chicks from this remote colony of 
Edmonson Point suggests that this area is free from IBDV contamination.

At this time, it must be assumed that IBDV may be pathogenic in Antarctic 
penguins, and is likely to be spread by human activity. The potential for 
expeditioners and tourists to be vectors of disease as they move around 
Antarctica may pose the greatest threat yet to its avian fauna.
