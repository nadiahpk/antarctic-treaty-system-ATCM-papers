IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO 
THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Introduction

Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty calls on Parties to report annually on the 
steps they have taken to implement the Protocol, including 
notification as to how Parties have ensured compliance through 
the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative actions and 
enforcement measures (see Article 13 (3) of the Protocol).

Since its report to ATCM XX (XX ATCM/INF 7), the United 
Kingdom has brought into force further elements of its 
legislation to enact the provisions of the Protocol.

The UK has published a compendium of Protected Areas in the 
Antarctic. This will be distributed at ATCM XXI.

Detail

A further section (Section 7) of the Antarctic Act 1994 was 
brought into force on 1 November 1996. This prohibits United 
Kingdom nationals from:

  -  intentionally killing, injuring, capturing, 
     handling or molesting any native mammal or native 
     bird;

  -  intentionally disturbing a breeding or moulting 
     native mammal* or native bird or concentration of 
     native mammals* or native birds;

  -  removing or damaging a concentration of native 
     plants or such quantities of any native plant that 
     its local distribution or abundance will be 
     significantly affected;

  -  doing anything that is likely to cause 
     significant damage to the habitat of any native 
     mammal, bird, plant or invertebrate,

unless they hold a permit authorising such action.

A comprehensive compendium of Protected Areas in the 
Antarctic Area has been published. This will be made widely 
available including to all Treaty Contracting Parties, 
observers, Invited Experts and Tour Operators etc. It is 
intended to help those who manage Protected Areas as well as 
those who visit them.

*  N.B.  This provision in United Kingdom law goes further 
     that the requirements of Annex I by extending protection to 
     native mammals generally (ie including species of whales) 
     rather than just seals.
