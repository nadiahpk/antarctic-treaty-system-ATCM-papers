CONTRIBUTION TO UNDERSTANDING OF MINOR OR 
TRANSITORY ENVIRONMENT IMPACT

Agenda item 6b                  Submitted by Brazil

XXI ATCM/IP97
May, 1997
Original: English
The concept of MTI has deserved much of the attention of the Antarctic System community in the sense of trying to improve the understanding of 
such terms for the benefit of the practical applicability of measures provided in Annex I of Madrid Protocol.

Thus, the Brazilian Delegation wishes to submit a contribution for the improvement of the concept, offering further ideas that are being discussed by the 
Environmental Assessment Group of Brazilian Antarctic Program.

1. An impact will be considered minor or transitory if :
      - it is observable during a period of time shorter than or, at the most, 
the same as the seasonal cycle in which the impact occurred;
      - it does not extend the local assimilative capacity of its effects;
      - the spatial extend of these effects is strict restricted to the site where 
these occurred; and, in particular, if:
      - it does not reduce the specific diversity;
      - it does not interfere with the reprodutive and feeding processes of 
animal species, nor with the ecological processes;
      - it does not introduce exotic species to the region;
      - it does not modify in a clear visible manner the natural habitats, the 
local physiography nor the aesthetic, historical, natural and tourism values;
      - it does not introduce contaminants at levels above international 
standards;
      - it does not generate noise and odors that could disturb the normal 
behavior of the species of the region and
      - it does not disturb human activities and safety.

Consequently, even though it may require some mitigation measures, it 
does not require recovery measures, nor assessment of alternative locations or 
technologies.

2. An impact will be considered more than a minor or transitory impact if:
      - its effects are observed during a period of time longer than the sasonal 
cycle in which the impact occurred;
      - it extends the local natural assimilative capacity of its effects;
      - the spacial extend of these effects is or is not (it may be larger) 
restricted to the site where they occurred and violates international agreements on the 
protection of Antarctic ecosystems and their resources, as well as causing risks to 
human safety and, in particular:
- it reduces the specific diversity, interferes with the reproductive and 
feeding processes of animal species, with the ecological processes, introduces exotic 
species to the region, modifies in a clear visible manner the natural habitats, local 
physiography, the aesthetic, historical, natural and tourism values;
      - it introduces contaminants at levels higher than international 
standards, generates noise or odors that could disturb the normal behavior of the 
species of the region, disturbs human activities and safety, and that, as a consequence, 
requires effective mitigation or elimination measures as wellas the recovery of the 
affected environments and require assessment of alternative locations and technologies.

3. An impact will be considered less than a minor or transitory impact if:

      - it is observed during a period of time shorter than the seasonal cycle in 
which it occurred;
      - it is spatially localized;
      - it does not introduce any of the negative effects mentioned in item 2, 
to any degree, level, extend, duration and intensity;
      - it does not require any mitigation measures and, in particular, even if recurring:
      
            - it does not reach the limit of the local assimilative capacity of its 
effects, and that, strictly:
            - it is characterized as the outcome of an activity resulting from or 
necessary for scientific research .
