The abundance of n-3 fatty acids in Antarctic krill produces inter-
esting nutritional effects due to their anti-atherogenic action.
This study evaluates the effect of an intake of total krill (10%)
which supplies 230 mg/day/animal of n-3 fatty acids, on the athero-
genesis induced by the hypercholesterolemic diet in rabbits. During
12 weeks, a group B of animals (n=5) was fed with a hypercholes-
terolemic diet and another group C (n=5) with a hypercholesterol-
emic diet and krill at 10%; a control group A (n=5) was fed with a
balanced diet. Less (p≤0,05) atheromatous plate were formed in the
pulmonary arteries and a decrease in the fatty acids content of the
aortopulmonary plates was observed in the animals of group C, fed
with krill. In another study, a group D of animals (n=4) fed with
a balanced diet after having been fed with a hypercholesterolemic
diet, was compared with another group E (n=5) fed with a balanced
diet and krill at 10%, after having been fed with a hypercholeste-
rolemic diet. It was proved the decrease of extension of the athe-
romatous plates (p≤0,05), as well as the lower content of lipids in
the animals of group E, fed with krill. Therefore, Antarctic krill
reduces lipidic deposits on the vascular walls, and in addition,
the morphology and interstitial constitution of aortopulmonary
plates; these effects are fundamentally ascribed to its high
content of n-3 fatty acids.

INTRODUCTION

The anti-atherogenic effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the
n-3 series has been suggested as the cause of the low level of
cardiovascular diseases in some populations with defined feeding
habits1-3. This effect is due to the anti-thrombotic4, anti-
hypertensive7, hypolipemic8 and anti-inflammatory9 actions of this
diet that produce changes in the lipoproteic and eicosanoids
metabolism.

Krill (Euphasia superba): a small Antarctic crustacean of 3 to 8 cm
that represents a considerable biomass10,11, constitutes an important
world proteic reserve12, at present, krill is available in dif-
ferent forms for human feeding, fundementally with the aim of sup-
plying proteins13. The high content of n-3 fatty acids in Antarctic
krill14,15 adds another nutritional interest to this species, because
the assumed anti-atherogenic effects it presents should make it a
natural feeding product that could contribute to modify the devel-
opment, and induce a regression, of atheromatous injuries.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Antarctic krill
on the development and regression of in vivo atheromas plates, in
rabbits, an animal frequently used in experimental atherogenesis
induced by a hypercholesterolemic diet16,17.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals Used

Twenty-four New Zealand albino rabbits with a weight of 2,5±0,3 kg
were used; they were divided in 5 groups and fed with different
diets: group A, 5 animals fed with a balanced diet for rabbits
(Villamil S.A., Montevideo, Uruguay); group B, 5 animals fed with
a balanced diet enriched with cholesterol at 1% w/w; group C, 5
animals fed with a balanced diet enriched with cholesterol at 1%
w/w and krill at 10% w/w; group D, 4 animals fed with a balanced
diet, and that had previously received a balanced diet enriched
with cholesterol at 1% w/w during 12 weeks, and group E, 5 animals
fed with a balanced diet and krill at 10% w/w, and that had pre-
viously received a balanced diet enriched with cholesterol at 1%
w/w during 12 weeks.

All the food was supplied in the form of pellets, ad libitum as
well as water. After 12 weeks of having started the diets, all
animals were sacrificed; animals in groups D and E were on diet for
24 weeks because they received a previous diet with cholesterol
during 12 weeks.

Chemical Study of the Diet

In all four types of diets used: 1) balanced diet; 2) balanced diet
enriched with cholesterol at 1% w/w; 3) balanced diet and pure
krill at 10%; and 4) balanced diet and pure krill at 10% w/w, en-
riched with cholesterol at 1% w/w, the following parameters were
                                                                 2
                                                                 3
                                                                 4
evaluated: humidity, proteins, lipids, glucides, fibres, minerals,
cholesterol, energy and content of saturated, monounsaturated,
polyunsaturated and n-3-fatty acids. The humidity percentage was
estimated by double weighing until obtaining a constant post-drying
weight. The dosage of proteins was estimated by the Kjeldahl
method. Lipids were extracted by the Foloh method with chloroform/
methanol v/v and valued in each weighing, after evaporation of the
solvent. The fibre content was estimated by the loss of weight
after ignition of the remanent dry residue of an acid digestion ,
and minerals by the calcination method. Glucides were granted the
difference in 100 g of food.

Cholesterol was estimated by the enzymatic method of cholesterol-
oxidase-peroxidase in the lipidic extract. The values of fatty
acids, specially those of the n-3 series, were obtained by gas
chromatography, after methylation of the lipidic extract with boron
trifluoride methanol (Sigma), and using as complementary standards
octadecanoic acid (ODA) C18:4 6,9,12,15; eicospentaenoic acid
(EPA) C20:5 5,8,11,14,17; and docosahexenoic acid (DEA) C22:6 4,7,
10,13,16,19 (sigma). For the chromatographic separation a 263-50
Hitachi gas chromatograph was used, with glass column of 2mx3mm of
ID, packed with diethylenglycol sucoinate at 15% on Uniport (Cosu-
kuw Kogys), 60/80 mesh, 180°C temperature, flow of 45 ml/min of N ,
in flame ionization detector . The values were obtained through
estimation of areas using a CRSA Shimadzu (Cromatopac) computerized
integrator module.

Biochemical Study

Blood samples were extracted by cardiac puncture from all animals
after having finished the diet, separating the serum by centrifu-
gation and keeping it at -20°C until its study.

Total cholesterol (TC) was estimated by the enzymatic method ,
triglycerides (TG) by the separation of solvents method  and
cholesterol linked to high density lipoproteins (cHDL) by selective
precipitation according to the Lopez-Virella technique  using
equipments from Wiener Laboratories. Cholesterol not linked to HDL
was estimated by difference ; no cHDL=TC-cHDL.

Histological study

The aorta and pulmonary arteries of rabbits were desiccated after
formalin fixation, extending them on plastic supports. They were
dyed with an alcoholic solution of Oil Red or in toto for direct
observation of the positive lipidic areas in the endothelial sur-
face. The arteries endothelial face and the reference rule were
photographed with a macro lens, projecting the image on graph
papered screen; the arteries contour, the red dyed areas and the
evidently high endothelial areas (0,1 mm or more) were drawn. The
different surfaces were measured to express them in percentages of
the arteries total surface.

Three cross sections of the aorta (arch, middle and low sectors)
and one oblique section of the pulmonary artery were bathed in
paraffin and later cut in 6μ thick strips to dye with Hemalum-
Eosine, PAS-Alcian Blue with elastase digestion, orceine for 
elasticity and Wilder for fibres, other arteries cross sections 
obtained with freezing microtome, were dyed with Oil Red O-Hemalum 
to visualized the cells with lipidic content.

In the cross sections of the arteries dyed with Hemalum-Eosine and 
using a micrometric ocular, the thickness of the artery's intima 
was measured (3 measures per section) starting exactly from the 
internal elastic limit.

In the cross sections dyed with Oil Red O, the average thickness 
occupied by the cells-nucleated by the lipidic content (macro-
phages) was estimated.

Statistical Methods
in all the values studied, Student's test for comparison of non 
matching groups was used to make the statistical estimations39.

The diet results are expressed as the averages of the quadrupli-
cates carried out in each case.

RESULTS

Diets
Table 1 shows the composition of the different diets. Diets 2 and 
4 show a higher content of cholesterol, diets 3 and 4 show diets 
with enriched cholesterol and the presence of n-3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acids due to the krill, and opposed to diets 1 and 2 that do 
not contain krill.

The contribution of n-3 fatty acids in diets 3 and 4 was of 230 
mg/day/animal; this value is obtained considering that 100 g of 
total krill contain 1,47g of n-3 (0,21g ODA; 0,80g EPA; 0,46g DEA) 
that the minimum daily intake of rabbits is 70g/kg of weight and 
that diets contain a 10% of total krill (table 1).

Plasmatic Lipidic Studies
Table 2 shows the results of the plasmatic lipidic studies: TC 
increased significantly (p<0,001) in groups B and C in relation to 
group A, at the expense of no HDL cholesterol.

Arterial Histological Studies
The measures of percentage surface occupied by injuries dyed with 
Oil Red O and by deep injuries on the aorta (figs. 1a and b) and 
pulmonary arteries of the animals fed with a balanced diet, were 
minimum, generally lipidic streaks. In table 3, it can be seen that 
no significant differences existed in the extension of injuries 
between the animals that only received cholesterol (group B) and 
those fed simultaneously with krill (group C). However, on the 
pulmonary arteries, the plates showed less development in the 
animals fed with krill (group C).

Examining the histological sections of the aorta and pulmonary 
arteries, it was possible to appreciate that in the animals fed 
with cholesterol (group B), an intima proliferation, fundamentally                         5
                                                                                                                   6

Figure 1: a) Endothelial surface of the aorta of a rabbit fed with a 
hypercholesterolemic diet. The lipidic content was studied with the Oil Red O 
technique. It can be easily seen the high injuries and the great extension of 
lipidic deposits (Oil Red 0 -2x). b) Luminal face of the aorta of a rabbit fed 
with a hypercholesterolemic diet + krill. The red injuries show lesser intensity 
and extension (Oil Red 0 -2x).
The animals that were fed with krill and cholesterol (group C), 
although the plates did not show significant differences in 
thickness (table 4), the dyed lipidic content was lower than that 
in group B, and in addition, the plates showed more fibrogenesis 
and a relatively alcianophillic mucoid matrix (figs. 3 and 4). The 
lussur amount of Oil Red O dyed material is visible in figure 1b, 
with an aortic endothelial surface of light orenge colour.

The red injuries and the plates were more extended (tables 3 and 5) 
in the animals that continued with only a balanced diet (group D), 
in comparision with those sacrified after 12 weeks of a diet with 
cholesterol (group B), although the lipidic content dyed with Oil 
Red O was lower in the sections of group D (figs. 5-8). Substitu- 
tion was done according to the increase of the fibrous scars that 
filled the central necrotic areas of the atheromatous plate. The 
necrosis detected by the existence of nuclear remains due to 
cariorrexis was more frequent in groups B and C.

Group E, that was fed with krill after a hypercholesterolemic diet, 
presented e lesser extension of aortic and pulmonary injuries in 
comparison with those that were fed afterwards with a balanced diet 
(group D, tables 3 and 5), with dimensions that remained stationary 
compared to those in the animals of group B.with lower evolution. 
In the histological sections, the reduction of macrophages was even 
more evident that the one in the animals of group D (figs. 5-8). 
The thickness of the intima did not present differences with the 
one of group D, and it even increased (table 4), at least in the 
aorta.


Figure 2: Cross section of aortic wall of a rabbit fed with a 
hypercholesterolemic diet. It is evident the high content of macrophages with 
light and foamy cytoplasm (HE x 400).
Figure 3: Cross section of aortic wall of a rabbit fed with a 
hypercholesterolemic diet plus krill. The content of macrophages is considerably 
lower, and a proliferation of muscular cells can also be seen at the sub-
endothelial level (HE x 200).

Lipids were substituted by a considerable increase of alcianophilic
interstitial matrix. In the histological sections it could also be
seen that group E, as well as group D, presented a development of
the subendothelial sector of well differentiated smooth muscular
cells, but the size of the layers, in general parallel to the light
and in circular distribution, were evidently higher in group E. On
the other hand, group D showed a dense fibrous catasplasm in the

DISCUSSION

The anti-atherogenic effect of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is postulated as an explanation for the low incidence of cardio-vascular diseases in some human and animal populations 1-3,30 and it is experimentally corroborated in the rabbit 31, fed with diets with n-3 fatty acids content varying from 300 to 900 mg per day per animal.

In the present study, a natural not prepared food was used, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which supplies a minimum intake of 230 mg of n-3 fatty acids per rabbit. It must be pointed out that the increase of n-3 fatty acids in the diet appears in all the acid lipids of the organism, as for example in the membrane's phospholipids 32. These changes produce an increase of the membrane flow that at the same time increases its resistance to endothelial injuries and to the formation of atheromatous plates 33,34. The increase of n-3 fatty acids in the membranes also modifies its relation to the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and consequently, the n-3 series of eicosanoids, thromboxane and prostacycline, eminently anti-atherogenic, predominate 33,35.

It must be considered that diets enriched with krill do not modify, in the base diet used (diet '1'in table 1), the global content of total proteins, lipids and minerals, because krill contains similar amounts of them 4,73% of lipids 36, 12-16% of proteins and 2,6-3,1% of mineral substances 37. The increased cholesterol in diets 2 and 4 can be observed by the increase seen in the TC plasma at the expense of the non HDL fraction, and which corroborates the descriptions in literature 31,38,39.

To study the arterial injuries we selected the technique for studying the intima's surface, the results of which have been previously guaranteed in rabbits by Duff et al 40. With the experimental conditions used, the aortic and pulmonary injuries induced by the hypercholesterolemic diet (group B) were extended and serious.

Groups D and E best evolution, even though it showed a decrease of macrophages in the intime up to values of 5% of the original concentrations, produced a process of extended fibroplasia or deposits of alcianophilic young collagene, without reducing the high injuries or even a small increase of its extension.

If atherogenesis is considered as a fundamentally inflammatory process, it should be admitted that, once started and even though the damaging factors cease their action, reparation phenomena continue, including fibrogenesis and proliferation of differentiated smooth muscular cells or in synthetic phase ones 42,43.

In the first place, the evolution of the animals fed with a hypercholesterolemic diets should be longer to allow a definition of the final destination of the fibroplastic process in the atheromatous plate. 
12
The marked surface extension of the arterial injuries induced with 
our model reduces the sensitivity of the method used by Duff et al 40 
that helps differentiate the effect of later diets. However, the 
late development and lesser extension of the atheromatous plates in 
the rabbits pulmonary arteries (compared to the aorta) helps to 
prove the lesser extension of the plates in the animals fed with 
krill and cholesterol (table 5).

The concentration of macrophages considerably decreased in those 
animals fed with krill (group C), both in the aorta as in the 
pulmonary artery, as seen in the cross sections of the arteries 
dyed for lipids. As this is a complex food, this decrease of the 
lipidic deposits should not be solely attributed to the n-3 fatty 
acids content; because krill also contains other substances with a 
possible protecting capacity against atherogenesis, such as oleic 
acid, selenium and magnesium 43,44.

The lower proportion of lipids with a plate thickness that was not 
significantly different between the animals in the B and C groups, 
was substituted in the animals fed with krill by a bigger amount of 
finely fibrillar interstitial matrix, amorphous and coloured by 
Alcian blue, that can be interpreted as newly deposited young 
collagene. Everything indicates that the plate's natural evolution 
is accelerated in the absence of massive concentrations of macro-
phages that would slow the phase of reparation with fibrogenesis of 
the smooth muscular cells.

The evolution of the cholesterol-induced plates was also different 
in the animals fed with krill compared to that in the animals fed 
later with a balanced diet (groups D and E). In this case, in the 
aorta, the plates extension and lipidic deposits was significantly 
less in the animals fed with krill. The same happened in the pul-
monary arteries in relation to the extension of the lipidic 
deposits.

In the histological sections of arteries of animals fed with a 
balanced diet, a peculiar stratified structure of plates could be 
observed, with dense fibrous nucleus and equally fibrous cata-
plasms. The animals fed with krill showed a lower amount of lipids, 
both free as well as macrophages, absence of dense fibrosis and a 
rich matrix of alcianophilic material with surface proliferation of 
differentiated smooth muscular cells, that substituted the fibrous 
cataplasm in the animals of group D. The presence of dense and non-
alcianophilic collagene, of difficult remodeling, seems to be 
linked to more evidence of cellular necrosis in the animals that 
didn't receive krill (group D).

It must be considered that n-3 fatty acids divert the production of 
leucotrienes in the macrophagic cells towards the series 5, with a 
lesser aggregation, chemotactile and vasoconstrictive effects than 
that of the series 4 originated in the n-6 fatty acids. Equally, 
there is a decrease in the synthesis of the A and B thromboxanes, 
with platelet anti-aggregation effect, and the platelet activation 
factors, for growth, cellular necrosis and interleucines. These 
   
12                                          13
modifications constitute the physiopathologic base of the effect produced by Antarctic krill on the atherosclerotic inflammatory process 32,46.

INTRODUCTION

Atherogenic disease is the main morbimortality cause in Uruguay, as
well as in other developed countries1,2.

The epidemiologic studies of the last decade have proved the
cardiovascular protecting effect of diets with omega 3 fatty acids
(w3)3.

This anti-atherogenic effect has been attributed to the multiple
actions (anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and
hypo-lipemic) of these acids4,5,6.

The anti-thrombotic effect is due mainly to the modification of the
prostanoids destination towards the prostaglandin 3 (PGI3) and
thromboxane A3 (TXA3) series, that produce a decrease of the
platelet functions7,8.

In this study, the contribution of w3 fatty acids is evaluated with
the help of a natural nourishment, the dust of Antarctic krill, on
platelet aggregation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Twenty (20) healthy subjects (volunteers) were evaluated; white
adults, with ages between 40 and 75 years.

Eleven (11) male and nine (9) female.

all of them were fed in a controlled way-with -25 grams per day of 
diet of Antarctic krill, supplied by "Proteinas Uruguuyas S.A."
(Tranquilones, Republlc of Uruguay), during a period of 7 days.

Prior to the diet with krill and after having completed the fore-
seen - 7 days, the following biologic parameters were evaluated: 
platelet count (line -"T Coulter Counter), bleeding time (Duke technic),
instrumental platelet aggregation (Born method at 37*, with continuous magnetic stirring)
using a 320 Chrono-log aggregometer. The presence of spontaneous 
platelet aggregation was-evaluated, considering as such the one 
produced in the absence of biologic stimulus, provided that the 
maximum value be higher than 30%, measured from the conventional 
calibration base line. The final ADP concentrations used were:
2,5x10 -M, 1,25x10 -M, 6,25x10 -M and 3,12x10 -M.

The sampling of omega 3 fatty acids, on plasmatic and platelet 
levels, was carried out with gas chromatographic technic (Hitachi 
20J-50) at a temperature of 185* (flame ionization); the areas were 
evaluated by means of a Cromatopac computerized integraph (Shimatsu 
ERSA) 11.

The statistic research was carried out with Student's test for 
dependent samples: SAS software for statistic analysis, value for 
p<0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Bleeding time and platelet count.(table I) didn't show significant 
differences.

The results for platelet aggregation can be graphically observed in 
figure 1. Significant differences were found in the mean values of 
platelet aggregation (expressed in percentages) for the final ADP 
concentrations lower than 2.5x10 -M. These results were: 1,25x10 -M,
6.25x10 -M and 3.12x10 -M.

An interesting alternative of this analysis may be the calibration of a mathematical model with the reference function (Michaelis-Menten kinetics), testing the comparison of the calibrated parameters on each curve of platelet aggregation.

The results corresponding to the evaluation of omega 3 fatty acids (w3) at plasmatic level are described in table II, where a significant increase both of the C20:5w3 (p<0,01) as well as of the C22:w3 (p<0,01) can be observed.

It is relevant to mention that fatty acids of the omega 3 series are found at plasmatic level; the technic's sensicivity limit is .....

A dose of 25 grams per day of Antarctic krill contributes 1.450 mg w3 series fatty acids. These doses (between 700 and 2.000 mg) are recommended to achieve a normal platelet function, .....

In the present study it can be appreciated how, with decreasingly lower concentrations of the inductive agent on platelet aggregation (ADP), a decrease of the maximum value of the profile appears after a period of 7 days with an oral intake of Antarctic krill.

Therefore, a natural diet with this product decreases the thrombogenic tendency of the vascular walls.

In addition, it is remarkable that in the only patient which showed spontaneous platelet aggregation, a normal profile was observed after the krill intake; another indication of the anti-aggregation effect of krill.

The intake of this dose was enough to modify the w3 content in the circulating lipids (fast turnover lipoproteins), not detected in lipoproteins of the platelet membrane (slow turnover).

It can be concluded that oral intakes of Antarctic krill, in the 
short term decroases the platiolot aggregation towards the normal 
limits, an offect ascribui to its contunt of omega 3 fatty acids 
(w3).

ABSTRACT

An anatomo-biochemical-radiologic study is carried out to determine 
the presence of atherosclerosis in 15 penguins captured in Artigas 
Base (Uruguay) in the Antarctic.

Angiographic studies were made on all the vascular system, and 
samples were taken from arteries and plasma.

No atherosclerotic injuries were found; biochemically, high concen-
trations of HDL (70%) low concentrations of LDL (20%) and a high 
value of the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio (3,51 ± 1,28) were found. These 
values indicate metabolic protection against cholesterol deposits 
in the vascular walls. There were no significant indications of 
atherosclerosis. The broad band of VLDL found (1-20%) is related to 
the specific avian metabolism and to their fasting at the time of 
their capture. Total plasma lipids and the lipoproteic fractions 
separated by ultracentrifugation/flotation show 2 EC not reported 
in other birds, suggesting their possible relation to penguins 
feeding habits in their wild state, of fish (rich in long chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids) and krill (poor in lipids).

Phosphatidylcholine is the main phospholipid of penguins lipopro-
teins and their particular apolipoprotein profile shows one main 
fraction and three minor ones of LDL and one main fraction and five 
minor ones of HDL. Lipoproteins metabolic aspects are discussed and 
their relation to the absence of atherosclerosis in penguins is 
ascribed to the peculiarities of the birds lipid metabolism added 
to their feeding habits in wild state and the special conditions of 
their natural habitat.

INTRODUCTION

The biochemical knowledge of plasmatic lipoproteins (PL) in men 
acquired in the last decades has granted a better understanding of 
atherosclerosis development The importance of feeding habits 
in the atherosclerosis development and the effect of lipoproteins 
on man as well as on animals has been completely demonstrated.
This knowledge has been strengthened by the studies carried out on birds37, especially on pigeons4, chickens19, hens35, roosters4, tur-keys39, geese30 and japanese quail39. We haven't found reports on the biochemistry of lipoproteins nor on angiographic studies carried out to learn of atherosclerosis on penguins.

It is for these reasons, that the present work carries out angio-graphic, biochemical (lipoproteins) and anatomo-pathologic studies to asses the presence of atherosclerosis in penguins in wild state and in their natural habitat, the Antarctic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Fifteen (15) penguins of three species were studied: 5 Pigoscelis Adelie, 5 Pigoscelis Papua and 5 Pigoscelis Antarctic, with a weight higher than 4 kg, with feathers; their ages could not be determined. They were captures at the Artigas Base (South Shetland) in the months of December-January, during their mating period and feeding on a natural diet of fish and krill, at an ambient temperature between 0°C and -15°C.

The penguins were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, 40-50 mg/kg, i/p, and blood was obtained from puncture of the brachial vein. The plasma was separated by centrifugation and kept in plastic bags of 50 ml, at -10°C.

Later, a neck incision is made on each specimen. Both carotids are exposed and with the Seldinger method several arteriographies are made in: cranium, neck, chest and abdomen. Three penguins were sacrificed, one of each species, with a pentobarbital overdose. Samples from arteries were taken: aorte, subclevian, carotids, cervicals and coronaries, that were put in formol at 10%, and transported to Uruguay with the plasma. As a reference, 20 samples of human plasmas were studied: 10 men and 10 women without coronary risks, with ages from 30 to 50 years.

The arteries, with an average of 20 fractions each, were bathed in paraffin and histologically studied with hematoxylin-eosine dyes and the Cajal Gallego trichrometric, modified for elastic fibres.

The estimation of total cholesterol (TC) was made by the enzymatic method using a Wiener laboratory kit41; triglycerides (TG) by the colorimetric method of Wiener-laboratories40; total phospholipids (PL) by the enzymatic method of Bio-Mérieux laboratories44 and free fatty acids (FFA) according to the colorimetric method of Dun-combe13. LP electrophoretic studies (EPL) were carried out in cellulose acetate according to the technique described1.

High density LP (HDL) were selectively precipitated according to the López-Virella technique25 and low density LP (LDL) using a kit from Bio-Mérieux laboratories18, obtaining the values of TC and PL as specified by the method. LP were separated by ultracentrifugation/ flotation according to the Hatch et al method19. In the HDL,

LDL and very low density LP (VLDL), TG, TG and PL were estimated 
according to the aforementioned techniques and total proteins (TP) 
by Lowry's method , using human albumin as standard.

Total plasma lipids and those of the different fractions were 
extracted by the Folch method, chloroform/methanol, 2:1(v/v)  and 
the neutral lipids were separated by fine layer chromatography in 
silica gel G (Merck), with oil ether/ethylin ether/acetic acid, 
90:10:1 (v/v) . The standards used were: free cholesterol, oleate 
cholesterol, triolein, stearic acid and dipalmitolphosphatidyl-
choline (Sigma). The stains were revealed with iodine fumes.

PLs of the total plasma and of the different fractions were precipitated with acetone from the total lipids extracted by the Folch 
method  and separated by fine layer chromatography in silica gel 
G (Merck) with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 25:15:4:2 
(v/v) . The standards used were: dipalmitolphosphatidylcholine and 
sphingomyelin (Sigma).

The stains were revealed with iodine fumes, scraped in tube and the 
phosphate content was estimated according to the colorimetric 
technique of Wlener laboratories .

The apolipoproteic composition (apo-LP) was studied with electrophoresis in polyacrylamide at 10% with sodium dodecylsulphate (PAM-
SDS) in tube, dyed with Cromasie Brilliant Blue at 0,25%, using the 
Weber and Osborn technique . The standards used were: a MV-SDS-70 
Sigma kit with lysozyme (PM14.300), beta-lactoglobuline (PM 
18.400), trypsinogen (PM 24.000), pepsin (PM 34.700), ovalbumin (PM 
45.000) and bovine albumin (PM 66.000).

The statistical studies were calculated with the student's test for 
comparison of two means (in independent variables).

RESULTS

Exhaustive studies carried out with a especially transported X Ray 
portable kit to the Artigas Base, angiographically proved the lack 
of atherosclerotic injuries in carotids, subclavians, aorta and 
branches.

Histologically, the bigger sized arteries structure belong to the 
"elastic" type arteries. The middle layer is formed by a concentric 
series of elastic layers of even thickness, and between them the 
conjunctive tissue and smooth muscular cells are distributed. In 
the periphery, a loose conjunctive with small vessels can be seen 
(figs. 1 and 2).

The smaller sized arteries (carotids, coronaries) belong to the 
"muscular" type. A clear internal elastic limit can be seen, and on 
it rests the endothelial coating with an almost virtual sub-
endothelium tissue.

                        26
The middle layer is formed almost exclusively of smooth muscular 
co!ls and on the outside, several irregular layers of elastic 
fibres of the external elastic limit can be seen. Lastly, there 
comes un adventitious formed by loose conjunctive tissue (fig. 3).

The vascular-nervous system (fig.4) was formed by an artery, two 
satellite veins and a nerve, without special characteristics.

In any of the different sections of the studied arteries there 
appeared atheromatous injuries.

The plasmatic values of TC, TO, PL and FFA are shown in Table 1. 
The first three are lower in penguins than in man, and the last, 
higher, corresponds to P. Papuas. FFA are the only values that 
showed differences between the species: 0,40 ± 0,14g/l in P.Papua; 
0,15 ± 0,07g/l in P.Antarctic and 0,15± 0,09g/l. in P.Adelia.

Tables II and III show the values for HDL-C, HDL-PL and LDL-C, LDL-
PL and their relations. It is remarkable the high content of HDL 
and the low content of LDL in penguins in comparison to man, but 
maintaining their C/PL constitutional relations.

The differences of cholesterol metabolism between penguins and man 
are shown in Table IV; that reflects the content of Tables II and 
III. HDL is 70%, LDL 20% and VLDL 10% of the total LP in penguins.

Figure 5 shows the EPL. VLDL is almost non existent (prebeta LP) 
and HDL (alpha LP) is higher in penguins than in man, as well as 
Rho (FFA linked to albumin). Table V shows the composition of LDL 
and HDL; the lipid/proteins ratios in penguins are 3,8:9,2:1,5 
in man 4,1:10,5:1,0. Figure 6 shows the EPL of the fractions sepa-
rated by ultracentrifugation/flotation, as purity index. Figure 7, 
fine layer chromatography of neutral lipids, two stains appear for 
esterified cholesterol (EC) level in penguins, and not present in 
man neither in the total plasma nor on the separated LP fractions. 
The scraping and detection of cholesterol, with the Lieberman-
Burchard reaction, according to the stern et al technique , was 
positive.

PL chromatographic fractioning is shown in fig. 8 and in Table VI. 
The PL profile in penguins is similar to that of man with a phos-
phatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio of 7 in HDL, that is to say 2,3 
times higher than that of LDL that is 3. This ratio in HDL is more 
evident in man. LDL in penguins shows a higher PL concentration in 
the phosphatidylinositol band that the one in man that is 8,9%.

Figure 9, HDL and LDL electrophoresis in PAA-SDS, shows that LP in 
penguins present a higher number of bands that in man. LDL shows a 
higher apo-LP, with a main PM of 66.000 deltons (minimum penetre-
tion in the PAA gel used) and several minor PMs between 30.000 and 
60.000 daltons.

HDL shows an apo-LP of PM.30.000 daltons and a Rf similar to that 
of the A  polypeptide of the human plasma, and several minor ones 
   
                 1              11
                 27
with PM between 35.000 and 66.000, 6 main PM of 66.000 and one
PM,15.000 daltons.

COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION

In birds, contrary to man and other mammaly, the fatty acids of 
more than 10 carbons absorbed by the intestine are transported via 
porta and carried in the systemic circulation by the VLDL trigly-
cerides. Due to this reason, we didn't find kilomiorons in any of 
the penguins studied but found instead broad VLDL differences (1-
20%), depending on the fasting level at the time of capture (by 
analogy with kilomirons (KM) of man, they are called portomicro-
crons). This VLDL low concentration in penguins has also been 
reported in other birds, as for example in turkeys . It has been 
suggested the efficiency of the vasouller lipolytic system in the 
prevention of VLDL accumulation in plasma , added in the penguin 
to the needs for energy uses, a result of the special conditions of 
their natural habitat.

According to the results, HDL represents the main circulating lipo-
protein in penguins. This has also been the case in turkeys , 
chickens, geese and pigeons . This fact, added to the LDL low 
concentration in penguins, and if the functions are the same as 
those in man, (if LDL contributes with cholesterol to the peri-
pheric tissues and HDL is in charge of the corporal distribution of 
cholesterol and of its purification at the hepatic level), shield 
explain the lack of atherosclerosis found in these birds in their 
wild state . It must be remarked that, not only the atheromatous 
plate didn't appear, but there was not the least thickening of the 
sub-endothelial connective tissue nor were there possible histopa-
thological signs of vascular aging (splitting, fragmentation or 
irregular thickening of the internal elastic limit, middle fibro-
sis).

The relative lipidic constitution of the different LP fractions in 
penguins is similar to that in other birds . Its composition, as 
well as that in total plasma, presents at each LP level, 2-eterides 
stains in the fine layer chromatography. This chromatographic pro-
file could be related to the fatty acids supplied by the penguin's 
special diet: fish (rich in long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) 
and krill (poor in lipids) or correspond to different steroids. 
Other authors have not suggested this fact in their studies of 
birds. 

The phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio in penguins is higher 
in HDL that in LDL, as happens with other birds  and with man . 
In our study, this ratio was more marked in penguins then in man. 
LDL presents an increase of PL at the phosphatidylinositol level 
that would require further research for an unmistekable charac-
terization.

The LDL apo-LP in penguins is different than that of man  and, in 
addition, it presents a bigger PM fraction (66.000 daltons) located 
close to the human apo-LPB, minor fractions, which would indicate 
LDL density (1,006-1,063 g/1). This data was observed in other 
birds .

ABSTRACT

A group of captured penguins kept at the Artigas Base (Uruguay) in
the Antarctic is studied. Four of them were fed with a natural diet
based on fish and another four with the same diet supplemented with
cholesterol.

Biochemical studies were carried out on the lipidic metabolism of
serum, arteries and liver.

A decrease of total cholesterol, due to its HDL fraction, from
0,92g/1 to 0,59g/1, was found on serum.

In the arteries, an increase of the cholesterol content was found,
but there were no modifications in the liver.

The anatomo-pathological studies of the vascular system do not show
any signs of atherosclerosis injuries.

The protective action on the arterial walls of the omega 3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, present in the natural diet of fish, is
discussed, as well as their possible importance in the liver's
lipidic metabolism.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies have proved the beneficial effect of the omega 3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic) in the prevention
and inhibition of atherosclerosis development12,13. These acids are
found mainly in fish and other sea animals11,13.

In a previous study we have demonstrated the absence of angio-
graphic and anatomo-pathological signs of atherosclerosis in adult
penguins, a fact which can be ascribed to the peculiar lipoproteic
metabolism of birds and to their special diet on krill and fish6.

The aim of this study is to subject penguins to a cholesterol-rich
diet, preserving their base diet and their natural habitat, the

of fatty acids of fish and possibly krill, on the development of 
atheromatous plaques.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Eight (8) penguins of the Pygosceles Papua species were studied.
They had a weight higher than 4 kg, with feathers, but their ages
could not be determined. They were divided in two groups of 4 sub-
jects each and kept captive in their natural habitat, the Antarc-
tic, during the months of December and January. They were fed daily
with fish. One group received a supplement of 2 grams of choles-
terol per day.

After 5 weeks, the penguins were sacrified with a pentobarbital
overdose and after a 24 hours fasting. The plasma of the blood
samples was separated by centrifugation and kept in plastic bags of
50 ml at -10°C. The arteries samples, from subclavian aorta, caro-
tids, cervicals, coronaries, and liver samples were bathed in for-
mol at 10%, and transported to Uruguay with the plasma, for their
study.

At plasmatic level the following parameters were estimated: total
cholesterol (TC) by the enzymatic method21 using a Wiener laboratory
kit; triglycerides (TG) by the colorimetric method23 according to
the kit of Wiener laboratories+ and total phospholipids (PL) by the
enzymatic method39 using a kit of Bio-Mérieux laboratories.

High density lipoproteins (HDL)-were selectively precipitated ac-
cording to the Lopez-Virella technique44 and low density lipopro-
teins (LDL) using a kit from Bio-Mérieux laboratories7, obtaining
the values of TC and PL as specified by the method.

In the arteries and the liver, after homogenization in a pH 7,4
phosphate buffer, TC was estimated according to the Stern et al
technique36, and total proteins (TP) by the modified Lowry method17
using human albumin as standard. Total lipids were extracted by the
Folch method, chloroform/ methanol, 2:1(v/v)5 and neutral lipids
were separated by fine layer chromatography in silica gel G
(Merck), with oil ether/ethylic ether/acetic acid, 90:10:1 (v/v)16.
The standards used were free cholesterol, oleate cholesterol, tri-
olein, estearic acid and dipalmitolphosphatidylcholine (Sigma). The
stains were revealed with iodine fumes.

The arteries, with an average of 20 fractions each, were bathed in
paraffin and histologically studied with hematoxiline-eosine dyes
and the Cajal-Gallego trichrometric, modified for elastic fibres.

The statistical studies were calculated with student's test for
comparison of two means (in independent variables);

## RESULTS

Histologicai Studies
In all the sections of the different arteries studied in both
groups, in no case were signs of atheromatous injuries found.

Biochemical Studies at the Plasmatic Level
Table I shows the values of TC, TO and PL. The decrease of TC is
significant (p<0,05), but not so that of TO and PL.

Tables II shows the values for HDL-C, HDL-PL and their HDL-C/PL
ratio. The decrease of HDL-C and of the HDL-C/VPL ratio are signi-
ficant (p<0,01): 36% and 23% respectively.

Table III shows the values for LDL-C, LDL-PL and their LDL-C/PL
ratio. There are no significant differences.

Table IV reflects the values indicated in the previous tables, with
a significant decrease (p<0,05) of the HDL-C/LDLC atherogenesis
ratio.

Arterial Level
Table V shows an increase (p<0;05) of 21% of cholesterol in the
arteries of penguins fed with a cholesterol-rich diet. This can
visualized in the fine layer chromatography of the arteries neutral
lipids (figure 4.1).

Hepatic Level
Table VI shows that, in both groups, there was no evidence of
significant differences in the total cholesterol content of the
liver. This can be visualized in the results of the fine layer
chromatography (figure 4.1).

## COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION

Although we do not know the amount of ingested cholesterol absorb-
ed, the differences found in the plasmatic lipids and lipoproteins
(decrease of TC at the expense of the HDL) are sufficiently impor-
tant and indicate the metabolic re-adaptation of penguins to an
increased intake of their base diet of sea products, rich in omega
3 polyunsaturated fatty acids4,12.

These differences would explain the increase of cholesterol found
at the arterial level indicated by the decrease of the HDL-C/LDL-C
ratio, which shows the increase in the tissue's cholesterol3 as
well as a high content of HDL phospholipids. This indicates that
the decrease corresponds to the HDL2 fraction, formed by the HDL3
fractions when they keep the cholesterol of tissues and other
plasmatic lipoproteins32,30,34.
This TC decrease at the expense of the HDL exclusively, has not 
been reported in other birds fed with non marine products and 
subjected to a cholesterol-rich diet 31,37.

On the other hand, if we consider:

1. the high content of daily intake of cholesterol in the diets of 
the penguins used in this study -500 mg/kg/day- (the average 
diet of man contains 10 mg/kg/day) 7;
2. the duration of this intake (5 weeks) that correspond to 3 
months in man, if life expectation for penguins is taken as 15 
years;
3. the absence of histological injuries in the arteries;

it is reasonable to admit that the specific metabolism of these 
birds and/or their diet rich in fish and krill, protect them from 
the development of arterial injuries.

This data must be confirmed with the time variable and the elimi-
nation of sea products from their diet, to corroborate their actual 
importance in the effect studied.

This kind of diet, rich in omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
diverts the eicosanoids metabolism towards the formation of I3 
prostacycline, a strong vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet 
aggregation, and to A3 thromboxane, biologically inert, instead of 
turning towards the I2 prostacycline, similar to I3 32, and to A2 
thromboxane, strong vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator. These 
are the biologic effects that decrease 36,35 (figure 42). The pro-
tection granted by these omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids deri-
vatives exists even in the presence of biochemical events of the 
atherogenesis process, as indicated by the increase of arterial 
cholesterol.

The action of the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derivatives 
on the plasmatic lipoproteins metabolism has been mainly observed 
in the decrease of the VLDL liver synthesis, and as a consequence, 
in the LDL and hepatic redistribution of the cholesterol flow 
towards the biliary pole. These effects exist even with an over-
charge of cholesterol, with no differences in the plasmatic trigly-
cerides nor on the LDL, and no increase of liver cholesterol 26,31,40. 
Further studies of the pools and flows of liver cholesterol are 
necessary to confirm these effects.

ABSTRACT

In this paper the authors analyze the lipidic composition of the
South Atlantic krill, as a natural source of fatty acids of the
Omega 3 series and their anti-atherogenic effect.

Total lipidic content of krill is 4,73g/100g of wet weight; 4,42g
correspond to total fatty acids with predominance of polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids in a P/s ratio of 1.5. The Omega "3 fatty acids
content is 1,47g/100g; ODA 212 mg/100g; EPA 796mg/100g; DHA 464mg/
100g and cholesterol is 30,2mg/100g of krill.

It can be concluded that krill presents peculiar lipidic charac-
teristics that make it one of the sea products with antiathero-
genic effects. Furthermore, its rich biomass constitutes a natural
reserve of Omega 3 fatty acids.

INTRODUCTION

The importance of the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the Omega 3
series: octodecatetraenoic (ODA) C18:4, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) C20:5 and docosahexaenoic (DHA) C22:6, in the prevention of
atherosclerosis development has been extensively researched.

This anti-atherogenic effect has been ascribed, fundamentally, to
their hypolipemic 3,31,35 and anti-thrombotic 10,31,36,31; anti-inflammatory 3,17
and anti-hypertensive 8,36 properties.

A wide range of foods, specially sea products, have been studied as
natural sources of Omega 3 fatty acids 4,16. Krill (Euphausia
superba), a crustacean approximately 3cm long, studied mainly for
its protein content as potential world reserve due to its abun-
dance 5,13, could constitute another natural resource of this kind of
fatty acids.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the lipidic content of krill,
specifically its Omega 3 fatty acids content.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sample to study
South Atlantic krill was used. It was captured in summer and kept 
at -20°C until its homogenization.

Lipidic Values
The percentage of humidity was estimated by double weighing, after 
having dried the homogenized result.

Lipids were extracted by the Folch method, chloroform/methanol 2:1 
(v/v)10 and the total content was estimated by weighing, after 
evaporation of the solvent.

On part of the lipidic extract, the following parameters were esti-
mated: total cholesterol (TC) by the enzymatic method with choles-
terol oxidase-peroxidase 31 triglycerides (TG) by the enzymatic 
method with lipase-glycerokinase11 phospholipids (PL) by phosphates 
estimation according to the colorimetric technique with molybdenum 
blue13; free fatty acids (FFA) by Duncombe's colorimetric method6.

Lipidic Separation
Total lipids were fractioned by fine layer chromatography in silica 
gel G (Merk), using as solvents: oil ether/ethylic ether/acetic 
acid, 90:10:1 (v/v)19, and using as standards: free cholesterol, 
oleate cholesterol, trioleine, estearic acid and dipalmitol phos-
phatidylcholine (Sigma).

The stains were revealed with bromothymol blue9 and scraping. Each 
fraction was kept in an extraction tube. Triglycerides and fatty 
acids were extracted with ethylic ether and phospholipids and 
cholesterol esters with chloroform/methanol 4:1 (v/v)37.

Fatty Acids Estimation
The total lipidic extract as well as each lipidic fraction extract-
ed were methylated with boron methanol trifluoride (Sigma)30.

The following products were used as standards and were submitted to 
the same methylation procedure: myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic 
acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), estearic acid (C18:0), 
arachidic acid (C20:0), behenic acid (C22:0), oleic acid (C18:1), 
linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), eicosaenoic acid 
(C20:1), eicosadienoic acid (C20:2), eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3), 
arachidonic acid (C20:4), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5) and the 
Omega 3 series acids: ODA (C18:4), EPA (C20:5) and DHA (C22:6), all 
of them Sigma products.

Chromatographic separation was done with a Hitachi 263-50 liquid 
gas chromatograph, in glass column of 2mx3mm of ID, packed with 
diethylenglycol succinate at-15% on a 60/80 Uniport B (Gasukuro 
Kogyo) mesh, at a temperature of 185°C, with a flow speed of 45 
ml/min, N2, with flame ionization detector. To separate and 
identify the fatty acids, the following parameters were changed:

1         4      2
1
C18:3 from C20:0 at 170°C; C20:3 from C22:0 at 177°C; and C18:4 
from C20:1 at 149°C and flow speed of 40 ml/min, N2. The estimation 
of each fatty acid was calculated from the corresponding peak areas 
and were compared with the peak areas of the fatty acids of known 
concentrations.

Expression of Results
The results are expressed by the everage of the quadruplicates 
estimated for each case.

COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION

Krill, similurly to other cold water sea products, presents a high
content of Omega 3 fatty acids (1,47g/100g) divided in: 212 MG/100G
of ODA, 796 mg/100g of EPA and 464mg/100g of DHA.

The recommended daily dose to obtain an anti-atherogenic effect is
of 1,0g/day contained in approximately 70g of krill14,14.

Comparing the lipidic content of krill with that in crustaceans in
general, it can be seen that the latter present a lipidic content
in the ratio of 1,4g/100g and 33% of the fatty acids correspond to
the Omega 3 series. Krill shows the same ratio.

Krill presents a polyunsaturated(PU)/saturated(S) fatty acids ratio
of 1,52 and crustaceans in general present a ratio of 1,4 to 2,3.
In relation to the monounsaturated fatty acids content, crustaceans
present a 25-30% and krill 27,7%16.

Cholesterol content in krill is of 30mg/100g, lower than that of
other crustaceans that present a content of 90–130mg/100g. This
difference may be attributed to the specific methodology applied in
this study12,16 or to a peculiarity of krill.

Krill presents an Omega 3 fatty acids content similar to that in
fish rich in them, such as salmon, tuna fish and anchovies, with
1,5g/100g3,4.

It must be pointed out that the Omega 3 fatty acids content is
present almost totally in the free fatty acids of krill (table V)
as well as the oleic acid that represents 21% of that fraction.

However, in the esterified fatty acids, PL, EC or TG, the palmitic
and estearic saturated fatty acids predominate (78%).

Consequently, the study of the lipidic content of krill indicates
that, in addition to its biologic proteic value, it presents
specific lipidic characteristics such as an acceptable PU/S fatty 
acids ratic, a low content of cholesterol and a high content of 
Omega 3 fatty acids.

Therefore, krill may be considered among the sea products with 
anti-atherogenic properties-and a considerable natural source of 
Omega 3 fatty acids.

ABSTRACT

Among the external factors that can play a role in the resistance 
to develop atheromas platelets in the penguin, it's their diet 
based on Antarctic krill. Krill presents a high content of fatty 
acids of the omega 3 series, fatty acids with anti-atherogenic 
effects. The results show that the penguin presents an omega 3 
fatty acids content at hepatic level of 0.38±14/100g of tissue, 
with a prevalence of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) at fats and hepatic 
levels. It has been concluded that penguins present an availability 
of omega 3 fatty acids, related to their diet, which can act as a 
protective element in the development of atheroma's platelets.

INTRODUCTION

The penguin (Pygosceles Papua) is a bird resistant to the 
development of atheromas platelets; in this resistance, an 
important external factor could be played by the contribution of 
the omega 3 fatty acids (FA) present in their natural diet: 
Antarctic krill (Euphasia Superba)1,2.

The omega 3 FA inhibit the development of atheromas platelets due 
to their hypolipemic3, anti-thrombotic4, anti-inflammatory5...and 
anti-hypertensive6 properties.

The transportation of diet lipids in birds, contrary to what 
happens in man, is done directly towards the liver via the 
portomicrons, and from this organ the corporal distribution is 
carried out towards the deposit tissues. This work evaluates the 
presence of polyunsaturated omega 3 FA in the liver and in the 
fatty tissues; the latter as an indicator of omega 3 FA corporal 
availability.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Five (5) penguins were studied with weights of 3.5-4.0 kg each, 
from the Uruguayan Antarctic base and fed with krill-based diet, 
their natural diet. After a fast of 48 hours, a blood sample was 
extracted with cardiac puncture, they were sacrificed and the liver
and part of the fatty tissues separated. The plasma was separated 
and the tissues wased with physiologic serum, and both preserved 
at -20°C until studied.

As control animals, 5 farm chickens (Gallus Domesticus) were 
selected, with weights of 2.5-3.5 kg each, fed with a grain-based 
diet. After a similar fast, they were sacrificed and processed in 
the same manner as the penguins.

The total lipids of the samples of known weight, of plasma, fatty 
tissues and liver, were extracted with a Folch mixture, chloroform: 
methanol (2:1) (v/v) in a 1/20 ratio7. The extracts were bathed in 
sodium chloride at 3%, dried with sodium sulphate and weighted 
after evaporation of the solvent.

The lipidic extracts were transmethilated with boron trifluoride: 
methanol (Sigma) during 30 minutes at 80°C and later analyzed with 
a Hitachi gas chromatograph, 263-50 Model, on a glass column of 2m 
by 3 mm of DI filled with DEGS at 15% on a Uniport B, 60-80 net, 
Detector: FID, Carrier: nitrogen.

For identification of the omega 3 FA, the Sigma standards were 
used: octadecatetraenoic acid (ODA) (C18:4Ω3), eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA) (C20:5Ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6Ω3), 
and for estimation, docosaenoic acid (C22:0).

RESULTS

Table I shows hepatic levels similar for total FA both in penguins 
and chickens tissue, and significant differences in the omega 3 FA. 
But the fatty tissue of penguins is rich in these polyunsaturated 
FA and in chickens this deposit is almost zero. In plasma, although 
their concentrations are similarly low, there is a prevalence of 
omega 3 FA in penguins is relation to that in chickens.

Table II shows the distribution of the omega 3 FA in the different 
tissues; in the control chickens; there is a prevalence of DHA; in 
penguins, there is an important amount of plasmatic EPA and fatty 
tissues with important amounts of the three omega 3 FA under study.

Although the total FA at hepatic level in both birds are similar, 
there is an increase of EPA in penguins and a decrease of other non 
omega 3 FA.

DISCUSSION

In many live beings, EPA and DHA are synthesized in limited amounts 
from the linoleic acid, and compete for the same desaturant and 
elogent enzymes that synthesize the arachidonic acid from the 
linoleic acid.
However, it is mainly from the phytoplanoton and marine algae that EPA and DHA are originated in the world, which afterwards is incorporated to fish and other sea animals that feed on algae, and which then pass through the feeding chain to other species8.

Tests with rats9 show that the concentrations of total hepatic lipids remain relatively constant, independently of the diet, but great increases of EPA and DHA can be observed due to intakes of marine oils10,11,12. Penguins, which feed on krill, rich in omega 3 FA (1.47g/100g of krill)2, show a significantly higher EPA concentration that the one found in chickens fed with a diet poor in FA.

Plasmatic levels of omega 3 FA, although in low concentrations in chickens and penguins, show significant differences in these last, that is justified by their higher content in the diet12.

At the fatty tissue level, the greatest differences can be found between the birds under study: from zero values in chickens up to 7.26+/-0.7g/100g of fatty tissue in penguins. Table III shows the values of omega 3 FA in rabbits fed with corn oil and Max Epa, a commercial product rich in polyunsaturated FA of the omega 3 series. This experience corroborates with our findings13. The results achieved could be interpreted as a new contribution to the hypothesis of the inhibitory property of omega 3 FA in the development of atheromas platelets, achieved with a natural diet based on krill14,15.
