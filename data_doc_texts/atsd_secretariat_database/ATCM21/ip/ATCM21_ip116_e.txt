OPENING ADDRESS BY AMBASSADOR WANJA TORNBERG,
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF SWEDEN

On behalf of the Delegation of Sweden I wish to thank the Government of
New Zealand for hosting the XXI st ATCM in this attractive and friendly
city of Christchurch. Under your chairmanship we can look forward to very
constructive and fruitful discussions.

It is unfortunate that the Protocol on environmental Protection has still not
been ratified by all Parties but the indications are that it will be so by the
XXIInd ATCM. This is encouraging but I'd like to stress the importance of
that Parties also enact domestic implementing legislation . This is necessary
to ensure the full protection for the Antarctic environment under the
Protocol..

Sweden believes that the establishment of a Secretariat is essential to
ensure the functioning of the Protocol and the Antarctic Treaty System in
general. Considering the delay in deciding upon a secretariat some kind of
interim secretarial services are needed to give TEWG and later the CEP
necessary support.

Regarding the Liability Annex we feel that we have made substantial
progress in our deliberations. As we now come closer to the time of the
entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection it is vital that
the WG on liability prepares a draft negotiating text to the XXIIInd ATCM
at Tromso when a Diplomatic Conference should be called. - It is
important that a liability regime is realistic, takes into account the difficult
conditions in Antarctica and does not unduly jeopardise science
programmes.

Concluding we like to reiterate our pleasure to be here in Christchurch and
to work with you for the success of this meeting.
