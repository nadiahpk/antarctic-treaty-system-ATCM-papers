OPENING ADDRESS BY MR. J.P.H. BOSMAN, HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF
THE NETHERLANDS

Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,

May I begin by saying that I consider it a privilege to be invited to take part in a meeting 
in this splendid country. The fact that Abel Tasman, the Dutchman who, "discovered" 
New Zealand in 1642, chose not to remain must be accounted a serious mistake on his 
part. On the other hand, Tasman's return afforded my country the privilege of becoming 
the repository for the world's oldest cartographic depiction of New Zealand; it forms part 
of a map of the world set into a floor mosaic in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam in 1648. 
Any attempt to find Antarctica on this map would prove fruitless: the success of our 
collective aim of preserving this continent intact is due in part to the fact that we only 
discovered its existence comparatively recently.

This is the second time it has proved possible to distribute a considerable proportion of the 
conference documentation beforehand: the documentation in question consists of no less 
than 24 working papers and 15 information papers. The time devoted at previous ATCMs 
to consideration of organisational matters has proved worthwhile. The division of 
recommendations into measures, resolutions and decisions, the revision and annotation of 
the conference agenda and the guidelines on document distribution are all equally valuable 
improvements because each in its own way contributes to an awareness of what we are 
actually about. We therefore wholeheartedly support the proposal by France and New 
Zealand to incorporate the guidelines in the Rules of Procedure.

We are about to witness the entry into force of the Environmental Protocol. Let us hope 
that this is the last ATCM that is not preceded by a meeting of the Committee for 
Environmental Protection. A glance at the working papers that have been submitted 
reveals that virtually all of them concern the Protocol, e.g. Establishment issues of the 
CEP, Emergency Response Action in the event of natural or man-made disasters, Port (or 
Departure) State Jurisdiction, CEE methodology, a large number of management plans, as 
well as a guide to formulating such plans.

AVT97/BZ48312
At previous ATCMs we were condemned to deliver opening addresses that were 
inspiring and well-intentioned but, as we did not know what documents would be 
discussed, at the same time rather tenuous. On this occasion I can be brief: the work 
is there to be done, so let us get down to it.

Thank you.
