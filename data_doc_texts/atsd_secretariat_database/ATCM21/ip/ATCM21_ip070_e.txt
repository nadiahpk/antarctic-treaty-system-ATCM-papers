OPENING ADDRESS BY MR. JOSÉ OLMEDO MORÁN
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF ECUADOR

Mr. Chairman:

On behalf of the Delegation of Ecuador, I wish to congratulate you on your election to 
chair the XXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. I am convinced that under your leadership 
we shall attain very positive results that will lead to the protection of the white continent from 
the predatory activities prevailing in many regions of our planet. Through you, we also wish to 
express our appreciation to the government of New Zealand for it kind hospitality and for the 
efficient organization of this event.

As a consultative party to the Antarctic Treaty, and aware of its responsibilities, Ecuador 
regularly attends this meeting as well as others of transcendental importance to the Antarctic 
community. We have observed with optimism the international efforts aimed at protecting the 
Antarctic environment. As one of the Latin American countries directly connected the Antarctic, 
we recognize its importance to our peoples; we therefore believe that it is our responsibility to 
ensure that the activities carried out therein are framed within the guidelines and procedures 
provided for by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Protocol 
was ratified by Ecuador on January 4, 1993, the second consultative party to do so.

Unfortunately, due to internal difficulties, last year we were not able to carry out an 
expedition to the Antarctic; however, the present government is aware of the importance of 
maintaining its presence in the continent and, therefore, it is developing preparatory activities to 
send its seventh expedition by the end of the next southern summer. Ecuador will thus be able 
to continue its regular projects, particularly the environmental impact studies being carried out 
at the "Pedro Vicente Maldonado" Ecuatorian Station.

Ecuador is a peace-loving country which respects the environment and, consequently, it 
is developing an awareness campaign regarding the Antarctic scenic and artistic values which 
includes a musical CD, "Ecuador Canta a la Antártica", which will be circulated among the 
consultative parties. We also wish to reaffirm our intention to continue working for the benefit 
of the Antarctic continent, in order to protect its environment and, above all, to persist in the 
hope that in the next century, man will continue to enjoy this privileged bastion of nature.

Mr. Chairman, we wish to express our hope that these discussions be as fruitful as 
possible.
