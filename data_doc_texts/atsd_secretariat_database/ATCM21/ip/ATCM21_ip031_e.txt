MANAGEMENT OF ANTARCTIC DATA

Information Paper submitted by SCAR and COMNAP to XXI ATCM

Agenda Item 11

The Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) is now established at the International Centre for 
Antarctic Information and Research (ICAIR) here in Christchurch, New Zealand. Data set 
descriptions (metadata) about Antarctic scientific data (including historical data, environmental 
monitoring data and data for which access restrictions may apply), are being entered into the 
AMD using the Directory Interchange Format (DIF) of the International Directory Network 
(IDN). The minimum level of information considered adequate to describe a data set has been 
identified and will include what data compose the data set, where and when the data were 
collected and whom to contact to obtain access. A search interface to the AMD, based on the 
World Wide Web (WWW), is being developed by ICAIR and, for those without access to the 
WWW, alternative information products will be provided.

  Following XXIII SCAR, in 1994, SCAR and COMNAP issued a call to their members to 
establish National Antarctic Data Centres (NADCs). Together with the AMD, the NADCs 
form the key component of the SCAR-COMNAP Antarctic Data Directory System (ADDS). 
Recognizing that the establishment and support of NADCs is critical to the success of the 
ADDS, at XXIV SCAR, in 1996, SCAR and COMNAP re-iterated their call to their members 
to establish and resource their NADCs. Currently eight countries have formally designated 
NADCs and a further six NADCs have been informally identified. Version 1.0 of the AMD 
DIF Authoring Tool (a Users' Guide and Reference Manual complete with install/set-up 
diskettes) has been distributed by ICAIR to all NADCs.

  An inaugural NADC Managers workshop will be held during the first week of XXI ATCM for 
the purpose of training the national data managers in the technical aspects of operating within 
the AMD framework. The main foci of the workshop will be:
  • the role of NADCs;
  • strategies for obtaining data set descriptions from data holders;
  • completion of data set descriptions;
  • developing 'best practice' guidelines for Antarctic data and information management.

  The workshop will mark the transition of the AMD and NADC network into an operational 
system. Recognizing that successful establishment of NADCs and the operation of the AMD 
will be greatly assisted by the workshop, SCAR and COMNAP have asked that National 
Operators give the highest priority to ensuring that their NADC managers attend.

  At XXIV SCAR, Working Groups were asked to identify those areas or types of data that 
should have the highest priority when producing data set descriptions. This guidance from the 
Antarctic scientific community will allow the NADCs to focus their efforts on seeking out the 
types of data having the highest priority and utility for science use, and ensuring descriptions 
are placed in the AMD. It is considered that the future role of the SCAR Working Groups 
within the Antarctic Data Directory System will be:
  • to continue providing scientific guidance to the AMD and NADCs;
  • to review the developing 'best practice' data and information management guidelines;
  • to promote and support the preparation of data set descriptions (DIFs) within their 
science discipline.

With the design of the ADDS and the establishment of the AMD, the SCAR-COMNAP ad hoc 
Planning Group on Antarctic Data Management has completed the tasks for which it was 
formed. Effective from April 1997, the Planning Group has been replaced by a SCAR-
COMNAP Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management (JCADM) to provide on-going 
support for Antarctic data management and the development of the AMD/ADDS.

MANAGEMENT OF ANTARCTIC DATA

The primary role of the JCADM will be:
·     to establish Antarctic data management policies and priorities;
·     to promote, coordinate and support National Antarctic Data Centres;
·     to promote data management within the Antarctic scientific community;
·     to report to SCAR and COMNAP (hence the Antarctic Treaty) on Antarctic data 
      management issues;
·     to provide feedback to ICAIR on the operation of the AMD;
·     to participate in further development of the International Directory Network (IDN).

The membership of the JCADM will comprise the managers of each National Antarctic Data 
Centre and one nominee from each of SCAR, COMNAP, and the AMD host (ICAIR).

Antarctic Master Directory.
