between New Zealand and South Africa

Background

New Zealand and South Africa have traditionally had a close working relationship
within the context of the Antarctic Treaty. Both countries are closely linked to the
region, by their geographical proximity to Antarctica, sharing a focus on the Southern
Ocean and the impact it has on our climate and environmental processes.

2       A ‘Joint Statement of Antarctic Cooperation’, was signed by Prime Minister
Bolger and President Mandela on 15 November 1995, which forms the basis for
further scientific collaboration. It recalls the joint commitment of South Africa and
New Zealand to the Antarctic Treaty, and acknowledges ‘the need to investigate and
develop scientific ties between the two countries and identifies possible areas for
collaboration such as:

(i)     the exchange of scientific information related to the study of Antarctica and
its surrounding seas,

(ii)    opportunities for exchanges of young scientists, and

(iii)   collaborative scientific projects involving research on the natural
environment of Antarctic and Southern Ocean, in particular, research on climatic
and terrestrial processes, bio-diversity and the impact of human activities.’

Report

3       The Antarctic science relationship between New Zealand and South Africa,
was given added impetus by a visit to South Africa in 1995 by the Chairperson of the
then Ross Dependency Research Committee, the late Sir Robin Irvine. The bilateral
visit identified ‘Marine Science’ as a major area where there was a gap in New
Zealand’s knowledge. It is an area where South African research would be particularly
relevant to the Southern Ocean south of New Zealand. It also provides good
justification for developing a New Zealand programme of marine research, along
similar lines to that of the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP).
4     The South African Government has since offered to bring its Antarctic research 
and supply vessel - 'SA Agulhas' - on a joint oceanographic research voyage to 
Antarctica, by the two countries in early 1999. As a maritime nation, New Zealand's 
environment is also largely influenced by the ocean. While it has much in common 
with South Africa, it has not traditionally concentrated its research efforts in the 
Southern Ocean. New Zealand has been limited by not having a vessel, with the 
necessary ice breaking capabilities, to undertake oceanographic research in Antarctica. 
The availability of SA Agulhas' research laboratories and facilities to New Zealand 
scientists, will provide a valuable opportunity to work together with South Africa in 
areas of mutual interest.

6     During the voyage, the vessel will circumnavigate the Antarctic continent, 
undertaking inspections of a number of national bases as a Treaty requirement. 
Fourteen days of the cruise will be dedicated to Science. This is to take place in the 
form of a multi-disciplinary research programme during the Christchurch to McMurdo 
leg of the voyage. Scientists from other Treaty countries, such as the USA, the UK 
and Australia, have also been invited to participate in the programme. The following 
scientific activities are being planned for the voyage:

1     Marine and Oceanographic research

6     The main objective of SA Agulhas voyage will be to determine which factors 
control the productivity of the water masses of the Southern Ocean. The magnitude of 
the primary production is a key determinant of both productivity of polar food-webs 
and in the mediation of biogenic gases which are important in climate control.

7     The water masses of the Southern Ocean are known to be the largest repository 
of macronutrients (such as nitrate and silicate) in the world Ocean, yet there are 
paradoxically regions of low phytoplankton production and productivity. The highest 
regions of productivity are generally associated with the frontal boundaries that 
separate the different water masses.

8     Research on the SA Agulhas voyage, will focus on the study of physical, 
chemical and biological aspects of the major oceanic frontal systems and water masses 
between New Zealand and Antarctica. The programme includes ocean optics, 
chemistry, detailed spatial mapping of physical, chemical and biological variables 
across water masses and fronts (eg temperature, salinity, O2, CO2, macronutrients, 
phytoplankton fluorescence, zooplankton stocks).
9      The measurements taken on the voyage will enable an assessment of the 
       relative roles of biological and physical processes within this region of ocean, in the 
       control of atmospheric gases, especially carbon dioxide. These process-oriented 
       studies will be carried out at a number of stations within the water masses. The data 
       collected will include nutrients, dimethyl sulphide, in situ primary production, 
       phytoplankton manipulation bioassays (using light or nutrients), grazing rates, 
       sedimentation rates. These experiments will show what factor(s) control 
       phytoplankton production while examining the effects of elevated productivity on the 
       foodweb.

10     This research will build on recent international voyages in the Southern Ocean 
       associated with major global programmes, such as the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study 
       (JGOFS), and make a significant contribution to our understanding of both the 
       implications of phytoplankton dynamics for the functioning of polar food-webs and 
       the potential role of the Southern Ocean in global climate change.

2      Marine Ecology - Predator/Prey Research

11     There are also gaps in New Zealand’s knowledge in ‘marine ecology’. For 
       instance, little is known about the abundance and distribution of krill in the Ross Sea. 
       Fine scale assessments will be undertaken during the voyage, of krill stocks and age 
       classes, together with ‘at-sea observations’ of foraging predators in several areas of 
       the Ross Sea. These assessments will be made on the distribution and abundance of 
       two species of Krill (Euphausia superba and E. Chrystallorophias) in respect to the 
       foraging areas of penguins at these different colonies.

12     The second aspect of this predator-prey research will focus on penguin 
       populations, their behaviour and breeding success as well as how it is related to 
       environmental factors.

3      Hydrographic Charting

13     It has also been proposed that New Zealand and South Africa undertake some 
       hydrographic mapping work, to meet their respective Treaty obligations. Very little 
       charting has taken place, to date, in the Ross Sea. The SA Agulhas’s voyage will also 
       provide a valuable opportunity for both countries to work together in this area.
Conclusion

14     The 'Joint Statement of Antarctic Collaboration' between New Zealand and 
South Africa, has provided a catalyst for the development of joint scientific initiatives 
by both nations. This cooperation, it is anticipated, could be extended to include 
exchanges by scientists, policy officers and administrators, enabling the transfer of 
technology in both scientific and in other related fields. For instance such a 
programme might as provide an opportunity for South Africa to become involved with 
the work yet to be undertaken by New Zealand's National Compliance Unit, and vice 
versa, in an effort to control unregulated and illegal fishing in CCAMLR waters. The 
planned collaborative voyage of the SA Agulhas should provide a visible boost to the 
effective implementation of the joint statement as well as set the stage for further 
international scientific cooperation, by New Zealand and South Africa, with the larger 
Treaty community.
