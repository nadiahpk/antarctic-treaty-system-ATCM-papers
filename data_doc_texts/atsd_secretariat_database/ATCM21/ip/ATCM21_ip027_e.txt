Information Paper

Environmental Monitoring at the Korean Station, King Sejong on 
King George Island

(Agenda 14 : Submitted by Republic of Korea)

Coastal environment on King George Island is likely to be subject to 
human impacts, because several countries have been operating their 
stations for many years. Long-term monitoring on human impacts has 
recently been initiated in coastal areas around the station. Phytoplankton 
in the Marian Cove are being studied at the community level, and some 
key organisms including marine bivalves are being used as indicator 
species for heavy metal and some other pollutant contamination. In 
addition, experimental studies on variations in morphology and physiology 
of marine microalgae in response to regional and global environmental 
changes will be conducted as a part of the long-term monitoring program.

A. Nearshore marine ecosystem monitoring

Focused mainly on phytoplankton communities in the Marian Cove, 
seasonal variations in species composition, abundance and productivity of 
phytoplankton are being investigated in order to understand the dynamics 
and furthermore to clarify the relationships with environmental changes. 
Related oceanographic and meteorological parameters, such as ice cover, 
seawater and air temperature, salinity, wind speed and direction, and UV 
radiation are also being routinely measured. This work, which began in 
the 1993/1994 season, and amended and expanded year after year, is now 
being carried out year round at the station. In the 1997/1998, a Brewer 
Ozone Spectrophotometer will be set up at the station, and stratospheric 
ozone level will be monitored on a regular time interval in relation to the 
marine ecosystem monitoring.
B. Sewage outfall monitoring

The first work was carried out by Korean Antarctic Summer Research Party during the 1996/1997 Season. Seawater samples were collected near the sewage outfall; chemical elements such as nitrate, phosphate, pH are being analyzed and bacterial number being counted. Changes in chemical and microbial characteristics will be monitored on a regular time interval. In addition, long-term monitoring on seaweed and epifaunal benthic communities near the outfall will be initiated in the 1997/1998.

C. Heavy metal accumulation monitoring around the station

Baseline heavy metal concentrations were determined in the tissues of the Antarctic clam Laternula elliptica, one of the common marine benthic organisms in the Antarctic nearshore waters. Results showed that L. elliptica tends to strongly accumulate most of heavy metals with tissue concentrations being comparable to those of mussels and oysters in temperate waters. It suggests that this bivalve species could be used as a suitable biomonitor for metal pollution in the Antarctic coastal waters. Soil and fresh water, nearshore marine sediment and other marine organisms and lichens have also been collected and are being assessed for heavy metal contamination. Metal accumulation will be monitored every two or three years.

D. Others

In 1996 we completed a topographic map of the Barton Peninsula, King George Island(The map is available from the Polar Research Center, KORDI). We are also working on a geologic map of the same area, to be completed in a few years. As a collaborative work with scientists of Chile, we are planning to construct a biological map for the distributions of lichen, moss, birds, seals etc..
