Dear Professor Wolfrum,

I apologise for intervening in the work of your committee at such a late
stage in your proceedings: I regret that we have only recently been made
aware of your deliberations. Nonetheless we felt that it was worthwhile to
contact you in view of the nature of our work and in view also of our
experience in several areas which are very similar to those under
discussion by your group.

I shall send by mail to your office in Germany a copy of a brochure which
explains the nature and operation of the International Group in more
detail. It is perhaps sufficient to explain here that the International Group
represents its fourteen constituent members, mutual insurers who cover
between them the third party liabilities of more than 90% of the world's
ocean-going tonnage. Each of the P&I Clubs in the International Group is
a true mutual in the sense that they are not run for profit: risks are shared
mutually and as a consequence there is a general expectation that the risks
which each shipowner member brings to the Club are roughly comparable.

Because they cover the third party liabilities of shipowners the Clubs have
been involved in much of the legislation developed in the maritime field
by UNCTAD and IMO. Of particular relevance to your work has been
our involvement in the law governing pollution. The Civil Liability
Convention (CLC) in respect of oil pollution broke new ground in

developing a system whereby liability for pollution damage under the 
Convention was channelled to one party, the registered owner, who was 
obliged to provide a certificate of insurance in respect of the shipowner's 
liability under the Convention. Claims in excess of this amount are met 
by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund which was 
establised by a Convention agreed in 1971 (both oil pollution conventions 
were revised in 1992). The Clubs were closely involved in the 
development of these Conventions and are the principal providers of the 
compulsory insurance certificates.

        We were also closely involved in the development of the HNS Convention 
1996 which again provides for compulsory insurance in respect of the 
carriage of hazardous and noxious cargoes. Again the compulsory 
insurance of the shipowner is supplemented by a fund established by 
cargo interests.

        We are currently involved in the development of a Protocol to the Basel 
Convention on the carriage of hazardous waste which aims to provide a 
comprehensive liability regime with compulsory insurance in respect of 
the carriage of hazardous waste.

        We were only marginally involved in the development of the CRTD 
Convention which aimed to provide for liability in respect of the land 
carriage of hazardous and noxious substances. This Convention has yet to 
come into force, one of the principal obstacles apparently being the 
inability of carriers to obtain the insurance which the Convention requires.

        I have outlined the International Group's experience in this field because 
it may be relevant to your concerns and we may be able to assist. We 
have been unable in the time available to study the texts which have been 
developed to date but, if you wish us to do so we would be happy to 
submit detailed comments at a later stage. In the meantime we can only 
comment that as a general matter insurers regard the provision of 
compulsory insurance as a form of anticipatory guarantee and therefore 
require the liability system and the limits of liability to be as clear and 
precise as possible. In particular the question of definition of damage 
needs to be delineated as narrowly as policy will allow - one of the 
reasons why the Clubs have refused to provide certificates of insurance

under the U.S. Oil Pollution Act is that the definition of damage is 
fundamentally flawed.

We stand ready to assist in any way that we can and look forward to 
hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

• Dear Mr. Schoeling,

Your letter of 11th April 1997 to Nigel Carden has been passed to me
because this is plainly a matter which concerns the International Group as a whole.

As you know the International Group is made up of fourteen P&I Clubs,
mutual insurance organizations which between them insure the third party
liabilities of over 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage. The
International Group has therefore been closely involved with most of the
developments regarding responsibility for the marine environment in
recent years. For instance we were closely involved in the development of
the Civil Liability Convention on oil pollution (1969) and the HNS
Convention (1996). We are currently involved in the development of a
liability Protocol to the Basel Convention on hazardous waste. With this
experience we consider that we may be able to assist the deliberations of
the Legal Experts Group which is due to meet in Christchurch.

We were not made aware of this matter in sufficient time to be able to
attend the meeting or make submissions to it but we very much hope that
an opportunity will be given for us to take part in the work in future.

Yours sincerely,

                  sm.
D.J.L. Watkins
