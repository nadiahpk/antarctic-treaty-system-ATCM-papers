WMO NETWORKS
IN SUPPORT OF ANTARCTIC OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH

Introduction

The Antarctic continent, covers almost 12.5 million square kilometres, compared with 7.7
million square kilometres for Australia. To the continental area can be added 1.5 million
square kilometres for permanent ice shelves, and in winter another 19 million square
kilometres of sea-ice covered ocean. The total area of interest to Antarctic scientists is
over 30 million square kilometres - four to five times the area of Australia.

The Trans-Antarctic Mountains cross the entire continent, rising as high as 4,900 metres
above sea level, and dividing the continent into two natural regions - East Antarctica and
West Antarctica. Antarctica has the world's greatest modern ice sheet, with an average
ice thickness of almost 2500 metres. This contains 90% of the world's ice and 75% of its
fresh water. It consists of enough ice to raise global sea level by some 65 metres if it
should melt. Much of the rock on which the ice is supported is below sea level. The
average surface elevation of the Antarctic ice sheet is 2300 metres but it rises to 4300
metres in the vicinity of Dome A (81°S 79°E), the highest point on the East Antarctic
Plateau.

Understanding basic attributes of the Earth's atmosphere is fundamental to understanding
our changing climate. Antarctica's icecap, sea ice and the general circulation of the
Southern Ocean are known to have major impacts on global climate. The influence of
Antarctica on the weather and climate of Australia (and other populated areas of the
Southern Hemisphere) has still to be quantified, but polar-region processes are turning
out to be of crucial importance to human-induced global environmental changes.

Surface observing network

Staffed stations

Although some 35 occupied stations south of latitude 60°S are staffed throughout the
year, the distribution of these across the continent is not uniform, and less well distributed
than during the International Geophysical Year in 1957-58. For example eight of these
stations are on King George Island at approximately latitude 62°S. Excluding the
Antarctic Peninsula, there are 16 staffed stations located on the Antarctic continent, most
on the coast at sites that can be reached by ship. Not all Antarctic stations contribute
observer measured surface meteorological data to the Global Telecommunications
System.

The USA station Amundsen-Scott at the South Pole (2800 metres above sea level) and
Vostok (at an altitude of 3488 m above sea level) are the only long term stations over the

continental interior that are staffed year-round. Vostok was originally established by a 
Soviet Antarctic expedition on 16 December 1957. Vostok was temporarily closed 
(including surface meteorological observations) from February to November 1994 and 
again from 23 January 1996. Surface meteorological observations were recommenced at 
Vostok station in February 1997.

The new station Japanese station Dome Fuji (77° 19'S 39° 42'E and 3810 metres above 
sea level) was settled in December 1994 for three years to carry out ice core drilling 
together with glaciological and meteorological research. Dome Fuji is located 1000 km 
south of Syowa. Surface meteorological observations are being provided three times a 
day for the three years while ice core drilling is being carried out at Dome Fuji. An 
automatic weather station operates continuously on the site.

Automatic weather stations

Automatic weather stations provide an essential contribution to the maintenance of a 
meaningful meteorological network over the continent, and particularly over the 
continental interior of East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the seasonal sea ice zone of 
the south Pacific. WMO recommends a spacing of 250 km for land areas over more 
heavily populated continents than Antarctic.

The USA network of 51 automatic weather stations is operated in the Antarctic by a 
principal scientific investigator Prof. Charles Sterns from the University of Wisconsin. 
These stations are operated to meet special meteorological objectives and measure air 
temperature, wind speed and direction, and air pressure. The data are received and stored 
by he ARGOS Data Collection System, at Landover, Maryland. ARGOS forwards the 
data to RTH Washington where it is entered into the GTS. The complete data set is 
provided daily to the University of Wisconsin from Service ARGOS, Landover, 
Maryland, via Internet.

Another sizeable AWS network of 10 stations, all on the east Antarctic ice sheet, is 
operated by the Australian Antarctic Division. Six of these stations are in the hinterland 
of the Lambert Glacier Basin, between 1830 m and 2740 m altitude. The other four are in 
Wilkes Land, between 1360 m and 3070 m above sea level. Data are updated 
approximately every hour, and data from all except one station are contributed to the 
GTS. These stations are powered with solar-charged 12v batteries and the longest running 
station has operated continuously for over 12 years. Stations closer to the coast and at 
lower altitudes have a shorter lifetime because they become buried in snow accumulation.

There are several other AWS which store data, rather than relay the information in real 
time via the GTS, in use by several other nations in Antarctica.

Upper air observations from Antarctic in general, but in particular from the interior of the 
continent now that only the Station at South Pole remains in operation, are of paramount 
importance. As can be seen in Table 1 above, there are 14 sites from which upper air 
soundings are currently made south of latitude 60°S, at either 00 UTC or 12 UTC. There 
is a long term (34 years) climatological record of upper air soundings at 00 UTC from 
Vostok (WMO No. 89606) for the period December 1957- January 1992.

Calibrations of remotely sensed data from polar orbiting satellites, such as the mean 
temperature of atmospheric layers, contained in TOVS data require at least a one, and 
preferably two or three sites, from which balloon borne radio sonde measurements are 
made of conditions over the continental ice cap are required. The only upper air sounding 
made over the continental interior being made is at South Pole (Amundsen-Scott) which 
has two flights per 24 hours (00 and 12 GMT) from November to February and one each 
day (00 GMT) for the remainder of the year.

WMO Expert Meeting on Antarctic Telecommunications

The telecommunication network within the Antarctic and the interconnecting links 
between the Antarctic and the GTS should ensure the rapid and reliable collection, 
exchange and further distribution of Antarctic meteorological data to satisfy the needs of 
Members of WMO. Meteorological services at many Antarctic stations are run by 
National Antarctic Programmes and not by the Meteorological Authority of the operating 
country.

Data to be transmitted

The data transmitted from the Antarctic should be composed of:
(a) Surface synoptic reports (WMO coded messages called SYNOP) for main and 
    intermediate standard hours (0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800 and 2100 
    UTC).

(b) Radiosonde data giving vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, moisture and win 
    velocity (WMO coded messages identified as TEMP) 0000 and 1200 UTC (and if 
    available for other hours) from all stations in the Antarctic Basic Synoptic Network 
    (ABSN) and also reports from additional stations as available.

(c) All reports from ships, aircraft, drifting buoys and automatic weather stations. 
    Meteorological data from buoys in the Southern Ocean and automatic weather 
    stations in the Antarctic are normally collected by ARGOS and then disseminated 
    from centres in Toulouse (France) and Landover (USA).

(d) Monthly WMO coded messages of a summary of weather observations during the 
    past month (CLIMAT) and monthly summary reports of upper air soundings 
    (CLIMAT TEMP).

(e) Priority reports, such as warnings of dangerous weather phenomena.

(f) Other types of information as agreed.

The Expert Meeting on Antarctic Telecommunication Arrangements was held in Geneva 
from 21 to 23 October 1996. The Deputy Secretary-General of WMO Mr M. J. P. Jarraud 
in his welcoming address (on behalf of the Secretary General) said that some progress had 
been made in WMO Antarctic activities, in particular expansion of the Antarctic Basic 
Synoptic Network (ABSN) by inclusion of real time data from Automatic Weather 
Stations in Antarctica on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The Internal 
Programme for Antarctic Drifting Buoys (IPAB) has been succesfully launched and it is 
providing data from the Southern Ocean that have very high impact on the improved 
performance of global analysis and prediction models of the atmosphere.

The links for the daily international exchange of meteorological data within Antarctica 
are shown in schematic form in Figure 1. The principal routes by which Antarctic 
meteorological data enter the GTS are depicted in Figure 2.

Mr Jarraud also indicated that deficiencies still exist in Antarctic observing and telecommunications networks. There is a decreasing number of upper-air stations. The delay between time of observation and insertion of reports into the GTS is still less than ideal. He pointed out that WMO Congress in 1995 re-emphasised the target time of within three hours for the reception of data from any Antarctic station at the Regional Telecommunication Hubs (RTH) of the GTS. Mr Jarraud said that the availability and appropriate use of satellite communications offers new opportunities for improvement in Antarctic telecommunications networks organised by National Meteorological Services and Managers of National Antarctic Programmes.

The meeting reviewed the existing Antarctic Basic Synoptic Network (ABSN) on the basis of monitoring results and several notifications received from Members regarding the status of their stations. A revised list of ABSN stations was developed. The meeting requested the Chairman of the WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology to submit this list to the WMO Executive Council meeting to be held in June 1997 (WMO EC-XLIX).

Monitoring the real time exchange of Antarctic data on the GTS

In addition to participating in the annual specific monitoring on the exchange of Antarctic data, Members may carry out their own monitoring. When shortcomings are identified, the results of such a survey should be communicated to the relevant GTS centres, including the Antarctic transmission stations, and the WMO Secretariat, to take appropriate action.

The WMO Expert Meeting on Antarctic Telecommunications noted that only 44% of weather reports from all Antarctic stations were received in Bracknell, UK, within three hours of the time of observation (see Table 2 below). The meeting felt that the present Antarctic telecommunication arrangements needed to be reviewed, with a view to:
(a)    Rationalising the arrangements, in particular avoiding the duplication of the distribution of data and output products by various telecommunication means;
(b)    Coordinating the evolution of the Antarctic arrangements with the global evolution of the GTS arrangements, in particular as regards the development of satellite distribution systems;
(c)    Benefiting from the introduction of new telecommunication services in the near future.

term climatic record eg. Vostok, then best endeavours must be made to install and 
maintain an AWS on the historical site.

Because of the short instrumental record of the Antarctic climate and the sparse weather 
reporting and climate reference station networks, compared with more populated parts of 
the globe, there is a need to try to design a synoptic weather reporting and reference 
climate station network for the future. New weather reporting and Reference Climate 
Stations are needed in West Antarctic and the continental interior of East Antarctica, to 
better represent the climate of Antarctica.

Automated Geophysical Observatories currently operated by USA, UK and Japan have 
the potential to fill the gaps in the meteorological network over the continental interior of 
East Antarctica for little additional costs. An Antarctic network with a spacing of say 
about 500 km should be achievable, and some further progress towards this goal could be 
made in the next five years if the Automatic Geophysical Observatories could be brought 
online through System ARGOS and WMO's GTS.

Identification of general locations in Antarctica and on Sub Antarctic Islands for 
installation, maintenance, calibration and replacement of AWS should be a result of the 
Review of the GCOS Surface Network. Accordingly a plan will be developed as to where 
AWS should in future be installed so as to provide a long term climate record.

Automatic Geophysical Observatories

UK

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Automatic Geophysical Observatory (AGO) is an 
unmanned station designed and built in-house to collect and store a wide variety of data 
sets from locations where permanently staffed activities are impractical. An AGO 
consists of a prefabricated housing, and is powered by renewable energy sources (wind 
power and solar panels) with energy storage in lead acid batteries. Novel features include 
the power management, and the thermal and environmental control systems. BAS AGOs 
collect key data for geospace and meteorology research. Two AGOs deployed in 
Antarctica in 1992 operated with great reliability, experiencing external temperatures as 
low as -50°C and wind speeds of 30 metres per second. Two years field experience led to 
an improved design for further deployments.

BAS now has four Automatic Geophysical Observatories operating on the polar plateau 
south of Halley Research Station. These AGOs support equipment for collecting and 
storing data for studies on many solar-terrestrial physics and meteorological phenomena. 
Meteorological information from these AGOs is not yet included in the real time data 
distribution on the WMO Global Telecommunications System (GTS).

The monitoring of the availability of real time observational data (SYNOP, TEMP and 
CLIMAT messages) from Antarctic stations at Regional Telecommunications Hubs 
(RTH) is an important function. For the purposes of monitoring WMO recommends the 
following cutoff times for the counting of the reports of SYNOP and TEMP reports:
(a)    For SYNOP reports: 1, 3 and 12 hours.
(b)    For TEMP reports 3 and 12 hours.

The Antarctic Telecommunications meeting recommended preparing a review of these 
Antarctic telecommunication arrangements before next session of the WMO EC Working 
Group on Antarctic Meteorology planned to be held in 1998. The WMO Secretariat was 
requested to send a questionnaire to Members signatory to the Antarctic Treaty before the 
next session of the Working Group.

The meeting reviewed the Antarctic telecommunications arrangements given in the 
Manual on the GTS - Volume II - Antarctic. It proposed some amendments to the Manual 
on the GTS and requested the chairman of the WMO EC Working Group on Antarctic 
Meteorology to submit these to WMO EC-XLIX in June 1997 for approval.

The Global Climate Observing System

We need to design the WMO surface and upper air weather observing networks over 
Antarctica and the Southern Oceans so that they will also serve to support the Global 
Climate Observing System (GCOS).

From a network spacing point of view it is desirable that formerly staffed stations that 
have a climatic record and are now closed eg Byrd to maintain an AWS on the historical 
site. If it is not financially possible to continuously operate a staffed station with a long

U.S.A.

Instrumentation and Sites

The U.S.A. AGO network, when completed, will consist of a suite of identical 
instruments (optical and radio wave auroral imagers, magnetometers, and narrow-and 
wide-band radio receivers) placed at six locations on the polar plateau. Meteorological 
data (temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction) are also obtained at each site.

The AGOs provide power and data acquisition as a host to the instruments in a room-
temperature shelter. They are powered by propane-fuelled thermoelectric generators that 
use no moving parts and can run for a full year between servicing visits, and are designed 
to be deployed and serviced by ski-equipped LC-130 Hercules and Twin Otter aircraft 
operated by the VXE-6 Antarctic flight squadron of the U. S. Navy. Yearly service visits 
provide opportunities to exchange optical disks used as recording media, replace fuel 
supplies, and refurbish equipment as needed. The AGOs were designed, built, and 
installed at the field sites by Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.

Three AGOs were established in December 1992 and January 1994. A fourth unit was 
deployed in January 1995. A fifth new AGO (P5) was deployed in January 1996. Half of 
the total cargo for AGO-P6 was put into the last site in January 1996, but air operations 
were suspended there until a better landing strip can be built. Revised plans called for the 
installation of P6 to be completed in January 1997, which was achieved.

The importance of communication of meteorological data on the GTS

Meteorological data are brought out in near real time in routine health and status 
transmissions routed through the ARGOS satellite data retrieval system. Parameters 
measured include the ambient air temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind 
direction. Currently, data from all satellite passes (about 28 per day in Antarctica) in the 
previous 24 hour interval are relayed by Service ARGOS to Lockheed on a once per day 
distribution via the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN). The health and status data 
are scaled, plotted and archived at Lockheed and a snapshot (the last satellite pass) is 
distributed to about a dozen interested parties via the Internet. Scaled meteorological data 
are likewise available on the Internet http://space.augsburg.edu/ago/index.html but they 
reflect the one day lag time.

The data transmitted to ARGOS is organised into the appropriate frame byte positions so 
that it should be directly compatible with WMO code. The Meteorology Program 
Manager of the USA AGOs (Dr J. A. Doolittle, Lockheed Research Laboratory) 
submitted a request through NOAA for WMO identification numbers for each of the 
USA AGOS. He intended that the meteorological data from the AGOs will eventually be 
distributed in real time via the WMO Global Telecommunications System (GTS).

If Service ARGOS is requested to perform the function of delivery of WMO coded 
messages to the GTS, then it would be necessary for the Meteorology Program Manager 
of the USA AGOs Project to initially supply Service ARGOS with the applicable scaling 
factors for each sensor, and then to subsequently provide updates as re-calibrations occur 
during annual service visits to each AGO. This would be a very important step for 
Antarctic atmospheric science because these data are likely to have a significant impact 
on the performance of global models of the atmosphere over Antarctica and the Southern 
Ocean.

Staffed stations and automatic weather stations tend to be mostly confined to the 
Antarctic coastline and adjacent hinterland. With the support of long range fixed wing 
aircraft the AGOs have been located in the high elevation continental interior of 
Antarctica. Apart from Amundsen-Scott station at the South Pole and Vostok, the deep 
interior of East Antarctica will remain largely unrepresented in global weather prediction 
models for many years to come, if the AGO network is not been brought on-line for this 
purpose.

Drifting buoys

The International Program for Drifting Buoys

The fourth session of the WMO/ICSU Joint Scientific Committee for the World Climate 
Research Program (WCRP) Working Group on Sea Ice and Climate (Rome, Italy, 
November 1989) concluded that a network of drifting buoys with a basic grid-scale of

11

500 km would be the most cost-effective means to obtain surface atmospheric pressure 
data and sea-ice drift observations over the Antarctic seasonal sea-ice zone, thus 
providing accurate wind field and upper ocean current information, as required, to test 
sea-ice models (See WCRP-41 : WMO/TD-No 377).

The International Program for Antarctic Buoys (IPAB) is a cooperative project aiming to 
establish a network of some 50 drifting buoys for both global weather forecasting and 
climate research. Ice strengthened drifting data buoys are used. Position, air pressure and 
(for those buoys in water) sea temperature are collected as basic data. Some systems are 
equipped to additionally measure other parameters such as air temperature, wind speed 
and direction. All buoys in the basic network should be equipped to enable data to be 
transmitted in real time. As a preferred approach, platforms are located and data is 
collected via CLS - Service ARGOS using the NOAA series of satellites. Some will be 
instrumented to measure ocean temperatures to 200 m depth and other variables.

There is a generally a northwards divergent flow of the pack ice drift in the Antarctic so 
many buoys deployed at high southern latitudes eventually move north of the ice edge and 
out of a main region of interest. Although IPAB has seen an increase in Antarctic drifting 
buoy activities, it has not yet achieved the required network density. The IPAB plan 
proposes a long-term commitment after the initial phase 1994 - 2000.

The Australian Sector of the Southern Ocean

Since the summer of 1994/95, data from all operational drifting buoys in of the Southern 
Ocean and Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) installed in the Australian sector of the 
Antarctic continent are distributed on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) in 
bulletins prepared by CLS-Argos (France). These ARGOS bulletins are received, via the 
WMO Global Telecommunications System, in Australian forecasting centres within two 
hours of the corresponding polar orbiting satellite pass.

In the eastern hemisphere there were 7 drifters operating south of latitude 55°S on 30 
April 1997 (see Figure 3). Four buoys were deployed in April by RSV Aurora Australis 
after departing Casey, at latitudes between 62°S to 66°S and between longitudes 110°E 
and 150°E. In early May 1997 two buoys were deployed from the RV Nathaniel B 
Palmer in the northwest Ross Sea, near latitude 68°S.

In response to the International Program for Antarctic Buoys (IPAB) of the World 
Climate Research Program (WCRP), Dr Ian Allison, Australian Antarctic Division, will 
continue to deploy four to six buoys each year. Deployment times and locations are 
required that will ensure that the buoys are placed onto ice floes or eventually become 
trapped within the pack ice and drift with the sea ice. For voyages other than those in 
winter that generally requires....

- deployment south of the Antarctic Divergence in the east wind drift, generally south 
of latitude 64°S.

The NOAA series of meteorological and oceanographic satellites

Large streams of meteorological and oceanographic data are provided by polar orbiting 
satellites. The polar-orbiting environmental satellites of the US National Ocean and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have one visible and four infra-red scanners. The 
NOAA satellites travel at an altitude of 850 km and have an orbit time of 104 minutes. 
They move over the ground at 6 km per second, taking an average of 13 minutes to pass 
from horizon to horizon. The satellites transmit continuously as they scan the earth. Each 
satellite is in view 4 to 6 times each day, depending on orbital ground tracks. NOAA 11, 
NOAA 12 and NOAA 14 satellites are currently operational, normally only two NOAA 
satellites are available.

Data from the NOAA satellites include information from the Advanced Very High 
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument and data relayed from buoys drifting in the 
Southern Ocean and Automatic Weather Stations on the Antarctic continent. There are 
more than 10 Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) ground stations in Antarctica, 
providing visual and infra-red images with a resolution of about 5 km. There is a network 
of at least three 3 High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) ground receiving 
stations operating in the Antarctic, at McMurdo, Casey and Rothera. HRPT stations 
collect additional satellite information such as Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder 
(TOVS) atmospheric layer temperature and moisture data, as well as providing imagery in 
four infra-red as well as one visible light channel with a horizontal resolution of 1 km.

The Australian system

The first HRPT satellite images were received at Casey in February 1991. It represented a 
major step forward in Australia's meteorological forecasting capability in Antarctica and 
provided the basis for Casey being recognised as an Antarctic Meteorological Centre. 
High resolution pictures from NOAA polar orbiting satellites covering an area within a 
radius of approximately 3,500 km from Casey are received at the AMC.

HRPT data received at the Casey Meteorological Centre, are transmitted in real time via a 
high speed data link to our National Meteorological and Operational Centre in Melbourne 
for operational purposes. HRPT data are also archived on Exabyte tapes for transport each 
summer to Hobart and Melbourne where data bases are stored. Ready access to the tapes 
is provided to Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre, CSIRO Office of Space Science & 
Applications and other researchers.

The actual orbital paths taken by polar orbiting satellites vary from the predicted orbital 
information so that griding of pictures has an accuracy of approximately + or - 5 km at
the centre of the swath, if it is based solely on the orbital predictions. Progress has been 
made at CSIRO Division of Oceanography in refining software so that AVHRR images, 
taken from NOAA polar orbiting satellites, are automatically remapped using 
geographical features identified and precisely located in the same orbit. In this way the 
location of any grid point or pixel for which data are available can be specified with an 
accuracy of 1 km at sub-satellite points over Australia.

Exabyte tapes of archived raw HRPT data for 1992-95 are freely available for loan from 
the Bureau of Meteorology or the Antarctic CRC. It is hoped that value added data, that 
has been renormalised and calibrated, and made available in a user friendly display system 
will eventually be provided by the Antarctic CRC and/or Mr Lee Belbin, Manager, 
Australian National Antarctic Data Centre.

Cloud drift and water vapour drift winds have been successfully derived by Dr. John Le 
Marshall, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, from geostationary meteorological satellite 
images down to about latitude 60°S. Hourly cloud drift winds routinely generated by the 
Australian Bureau of Meteorology have been proved to be useful and their impact on 
Numerical Weather Prediction has been quantified. Experimentation is continuing with 
the use of AVHRR cloud images from the NOAA series of polar orbiting satellites and 
some of the problems, including discrimination between cloud and ice are being 
overcome.

Sea Surface Wind Vectors

Visible and infrared imagery taken from satellites is most useful but such observations are 
affected by clouds and not all geophysical parameters on or near the Earth's surface can 
be "seen", even under clear-sky conditions. The importance of remote sensing techniques, 
utilising the microwave part of the spectrum has been recognised.

Over the vast Southern Ocean, apart from drifting buoys and isolated ship observations, 
sea level air pressure measurements are almost totally lacking. This deficiency limits the 
performance of numerical weather prediction models and will be exacerbated as model 
resolution improves. In summer when there are substantial areas free of sea ice, sea 
surface wind vectors are derived from scatterometer data, to locate more accurately over 
the Southern Ocean the centre and central pressure of extra-tropical cyclones and position 
of cold and warm fronts. Accordingly the initial location of synoptic weather systems is 
better specified in the analysis and hence forecasts are improved.

European Space Agency

ERS-1 launched in 1991 was the first satellite since SEASAT in 1978 to carry  a 
scatterometer for making sea surface observations. ERS-2 was launched in April 1995.

(ESA). Data from scatterometer instruments can be used to generate wind vectors over 
ice-free areas of the Southern Ocean. Since 1994 sea surface wind data derived from the 
scatterometer instrument on board the European Space Agency satellites ERS-1 and 
ERS-2 have been relayed from Europe via WMO's Global Telecommunications System, 
plotted and distributed within six hours of the satellite pass to analysts in National 
Meteorological Centres.

NASA

NASA scientists, using weather forecast models with newly incorporated data from the 
wind-measuring NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) instrument on-board Japan's Advanced 
Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), are secing significant improvements in their ability 
to analyse weather patterns and gencrate more accurate forecasts, especially in the 
Southern Hemisphere.

The scatterometer uses an array of stick-like antennas that radiate microwave pulses in 
the Ku-band across broad regions of the Earth's surface. A small faction of the energy in 
the radar pulses is reflected back and captured by NSCAT's antennas. At any given time 
NSCAT's array of six dual-beam antennas scans two swaths of ocean - one on either side 
of the satellite's near-polar, sun-synchronous 500-mile orbit. Each swath is 375 miles 
wide. The swaths are separated by a gap of about 215 miles directly below the satellite 
where no data collection is possible.

Accurate measurements of wind velocity in the Southern Hemisphere have been virtually 
non-existent duc to the vastness of the Southern Ocean. The NSCAT takes 190,000 wind 
measurements per day, mapping more than 90 per cent of the world's ice-free oceans 
every two days. The instrument is giving scientists more than 100 times the amount of 
ocean wind information than is available from ship reports or buoys. Because the 
scatterometer is a radar instrument, it operates 24 hours a day, collecting data day or 
night, regardless of sunlight or weather conditions.

The NSCAT instrument was launched August 16, 1996 on Japan's ADEOS. ADEOS is an 
international global change research mission of the National Space Development Agency 
of Japan, which includes instruments from the United States, Japan and France, with 
investigators from many other countries. The satellite is a key part of an international 
environmental research effort that includes NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) 
program, a long-term, coordinated research effort to study the Earth as a global 
environmental system. The goal of MTPE is to develop a better scientific understanding 
of natural environmental changes and to distinguish between natural and human-made 
changes and impacts. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed, built and manages the 
NSCAT instrument for NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth, Washington, DC.

Weather forecasters will be able to use these data to better predict the evolution of fronts 
and storms over the oceans and track them as they approach land and major population

centers. The maritime industry will benefit by steering ships away from storms and 
toward areas with favourable tailwinds. Initial experiments with the wind measurements 
taken by the scatterometer indicate the potential to extend the useful range of weather 
forecasts in the Southern Hemisphere by about 24 hours, according to Dr. Robert Atlas, 
an NSCAT science team member from the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. 
By combining the scatterometer wind data with ocean height data from the 
TOPEX/Poseidon mission, Earth scientists are getting a first hand look at the forcing 
function, the winds; and the ocean's response, ocean height and waves - in other words 
the forces that control much of our planet's weather and climate change.
