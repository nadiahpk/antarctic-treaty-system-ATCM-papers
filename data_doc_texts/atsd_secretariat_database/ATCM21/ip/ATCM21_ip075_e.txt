Original: English
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide 
this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 1996-97 as well as an overview of the estimated 
number of passengers for the 1997-98 season and preliminary five-year projection.

1.  Seabome Tourism

(a) Approximately 7,322 people traveled to the Antarctic on 13 commercially-orga-
nized tour vessels from November 1996 to March 1997 -- a significant decrease 
from the previous year's total of 9,212. A summary is appended.

(b) The Office of Polar Programs at the U.S. National Science Foundation distributes 
an annual summary of Antarctic tourism, compiled with the IAATO Secretariat.

(c) All 13 Antarctic tour vessels that sailed in 1996-97 were operated by IAATO 
members. Again this season, nine were of Russian registry.

(d) The vast majority of Antarctic voyages are to the peninsula region during the four-
month Austral summer, departing from Ushuaia or, in fewer numbers, from Punta 
Arenas or Stanley. The Tourism Board of Tierra del Fuego has compiled statistics 
over the last several years. Only 7 of the 114 departures announced for 1997-98 
will be outside of the Peninsula region.

(e) The icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov successfully completed the first-ever circum-
navigation of Antarctica for expedition tourism this season, November 24, 1996 - 
January 27, 1997, visiting 11 research stations all around the continent. A complete 
report on the voyage is available from the IAATO Secretariat.

(f) Commercial Antarctic Tour Vessels, 1996-97

  Ship                  Capacity   Since
  Explorer              100        1970
  World Discoverer      138        1977
  Bremen                164        1989
  Professor Molchanov   38         1991
  Kapitan Khlebnikov    114        1992
  Akademik Sergei Vavilov 80       1992
  Akademik Ioffe        80         1993
  Hanseatic             180        1993
  Alla Tarasova         120        1994
  Professor Khromov     38         1994
  Akademik Shokalskiy   36         1994
  Professor Multanovskiy 45        1995
  Akademik Shuleykin    45         1996

(g) The average number of passengers per voyage in 1996-97 was 70 (ranging from 23 
to 162) with an average carrying capacity of 91. The average carrying capacity for 
1997-98 will be 133 passengers (38 to 500).
(h) Antarctic yacht activity was addressed at the July 1996 meeting for Antarctic tour 
operators organized by NSF. Some 150 yacht visits have been made to Antarctica 
over the past 30 years. According to statistics provided by Sally Poncet, 17 yachts 
made 22 expeditions to Antarctica during the 1995-96 season, carrying 150 people, 
including 123 fare-paying passengers.

(i) According to information provided by tour operators to the IAATO Secretariat, 
114 voyages are planned for 1997-98, which will carry an estimated 10,590 travel-
ers on 15 vessels. Much of the increase in numbers over the 1996-97 season is due 
to the return of the Marco Polo, a tour vessel with a carrying capacity of 800 
passengers. Its Florida-based operator, Orient Lines, has said that they will limit 
the number of passengers to 400-500 per voyage. A summary is appended.

2.       Land-based Tourism

(a) Founding IAATO-member Adventure Network International, which operates a 
seasonal facility at Patriot Hills, Ellsworth Mountains, brought 91 travelers and 15 
staff to the Antarctic in 1996-97, its 11th Antarctic season. The camp was open 
from 15 October 1996 to 30 January 1997. Its expeditioners included a group of 
eight children from the United States, Poland and Norway as invited guests. In 
addition to its regular climbing programs to Vinson Massif (43), flights to the 
South Pole (16), and Emperor penguin camp (6).

(b) ANI continued its logistical and emergency support for all private-expeditions, four 
this season. All were provided with search-and-rescue coverage by ANI. The 
expeditions traveled by ski from Berkner Island (Weddell Sea) via the South Pole 
to the Ross Sea. Borge Ousland from Norway was the first person to cross the 
continent not only alone but also on skis and unsupported once he began the trek. 
Other ski expeditions included two from Hercules Inlet to the South Pole (U.K. and 
France), and another from the South Pole to Berkner Island (U.K.).

(c) Total flying time south of Punta Arenas: 192 hours for the Lockheed L-382 Hercul-
les, 190 hours for the two DHC-6 Twin Otters and 60 hours for the Cessna 185.

(d) ANI also served as the Emergency Contact Station for IAATO-member tour 
vessels in the Antarctic Peninsula. In this pilot program, ANI coordinated medical 
evacuation of IAATO-member passenger vessels in the Antarctic Peninsula with 
critically-injured or sick passengers (see IAATO Medical Emergency Contingency 
Plan, XX ATCM INF 76 for details). This function by ANI will continue in the 
1997-98 season.

(e) This season Polar Logistics, the logistical arm of Adventure Network International, 
made site surveys of a blue-ice runway near Novolazarevskaya Station (Russia) in 
Dronning Maud Land. Three flights were made from Cape Town in December 
1996 and January 1997 employing a Lockheed Hercules L-382G aircraft. A 
Preliminary Assessment of Environmental Impact was conducted for this activity.
(f)     The objective of the survey was to establish whether an air route to support 
Antarctic Treaty Parties active in this sector is a feasible and commercially viable 
prospect. Germany, India, South Africa, Norway, Russia and Japan all maintain 
research facilities in Dronning Maud Land, five of them year-round. In its first 
season, Polar Logistics assisted the governments of India, Norway and Russia by 
carrying cargo, mail or passengers. Two private expeditions were also supported.

(g)     The ice runway is near Holtedahlfjella, 200 km inland at an elevation of 1000 m 
above sea level. A temporary camp was established for weather reporting and 
reception of visitors, with a Twin Otter on standby for ongoing flights and a doctor 
on call. In addition, three alternate runways were surveyed.

3.      Overflights

(a)     Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia operated Qantas Antarctic Day Sightseeing 
flights from Melbourne aboard Qantas Airlines Boeing 747 aircraft for the third 
consecutive season. A total of 3,448 passengers participated on 10 flights from 1 
December 1996 to 16 February 1997 with approximately 23 crew per flight.

(b)     The activity is expected to continue at approximately the same level for next 
season.

(c)     In addition, Aerolineas Argentinas operates commercially scheduled "transpolar" 
flights between Argentina and New Zealand aboard its Boeing 747 aircraft.

4.      Antarctic Tourism Market Forecast

(a)     Appended to this report is a rough five-year forecast of the number of Antarctic 
tour operators, vessels, voyages and passengers. This preliminary projection of 
trends was made by the IAATO Secretariat based on a survey of IAATO members 
and the cruise industry.

(b)     According to current information, Antarctica is likely to remain a specialized and 
relatively expensive niche destination offered by a limited number of experienced 
operators focussing on educational voyages to areas of natural and wilderness 
value.

(c)     The projection is a reflection of current business development. Tour markets, 
however, are subject to change and with such an industry, the number of travelers 
would vary greatly with a small change in the number of tour operators or avail-
able ships.

IAATO Five-Year Forecast: Seaborne Antarctic Tourism, 1997-2002

This rough five-year forecast of commercially-organized shipborne tourism is based on a 
survey of planned activities by existing and known prospective Antarctic tour operators by the 
IAATO Secretariat. While tourism markets are difficult to predict, these numbers reflect 
current business development in a small industry. It assumes that appropriate Russian-flag 
vessels will continue to be available to operators at a favorable charter rate, that the regulato-
ry environment will remain largely unchanged, and that large cruise lines will not enter the 
market. None of the world cruise lines contacted expressed interest in future Antarctic 
voyages due to operational and marketing considerations.

These numbers should be interpreted with extreme caution since a change in one or two key 
operators would significantly modify the prediction of the number of ships, voyages and 
passengers. At present, one small company (Marine Expeditions) carries approximately 40% 
of Antarctic shipborne tourism. All current operators have announced that they will continue 
at approximately the same levels as the 1997-98 season for the next five years. This forecast 
includes preliminary projections for three new companies, each planning to operate a 100-150 
passenger ship in the Antarctic starting in 1998-99.

Based on current information, it is predicted that Antarctica will remain a specialized and 
relatively expensive niche destination offered by a limited number of experienced operators 
focussing on educational voyages to areas of exceptional natural history and wilderness value.
