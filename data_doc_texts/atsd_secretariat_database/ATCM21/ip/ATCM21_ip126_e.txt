ABSTRACT

Observations of natural and man-made floating megalitter, macrolitter and mesolitter in the Pacific section of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary from December 1994 to March 1995 are reported. Natural megalitter, mostly seaweed, was concentrated in the more northern latitudes near the start and finish of the expedition, especially near the Antarctic Convergence south of the Tasman Sea. Man-made megalitter was nowhere common, but was seen mostly near and to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and north and northwest of the Ross Sea, and consisted mostly of plastic items, especially styrofoam fragments. Fishing gear was not a major component of man-made debris. Macrolitter consisted mainly of seabird feathers. A very high density (544 per 10nm) of penguin feathers occurred northeast of the Ross Sea, whereas non-penguin feathers dominated north and northwest of the Ross Sea. In the southern Ross Sea a single sample contained 31 small dead fish. Natural mesolitter quantities were usually low, but high densities (to 391/ha) of penguin feathers occurred northeast of the Ross Sea, and pumice granules were concentrated near the Antarctic Convergence south of the Tasman Sea. Man-made mesolitter was usually absent but reached 8.7/ha midway between the Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea. Most items were individual styrofoam beads, but north of the convergence small numbers of hard plastic fragments were encountered. Biological associations with debris were not common, but included a filamentous green alga and small goose barnacles.

INTRODUCTION

Natural floating debris in the Southern Ocean is likely to contain material generated from local organisms such as seabirds and penguins, and seaweeds.

The Southern Ocean is so remote from major centres of civilisation that it is often considered to be "unpolluted" by human rubbish.

Plastics and other debris are some of the less desirable contributions of modern
3

civilisation to the marine environment, and are an acknowledged danger to marine life 
(Laist, 1987).

Sources of seaborne man-made debris in the Southern Ocean are most likely to be 
ships, including commercial fishing vessels, although some debris may originate from 
over 50 scientific bases established on the Antarctic continent and islands off the 
Antarctic Peninsula.

Although many studies have been made of plastic debris and other persistent litter 
stranded on shorelines, there have been relatively few studies of litter floating on 
coastal waters and particularly on the high seas. A Southern Hemisphere perspective 
on pelagic debris is contained in the recent review by Gregory and Ryan (1994).

The creation of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in December 1994 has focussed 
scientific interest in the Southern Ocean, and may act as a catalyst for an increase in 
scientific research in the area.

o The opportunity arose early in 1995 to study oceanic litter in a large section of the 
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary between the Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea. 
Both man-made and natural debris was documented on a voyage following the cruise 
track shown in Fig. 1, with more detail in the Ross Sea area in Fig. 2. Contemporary 
observations of whales and seabirds were also made, reported by Pierpoint (in prep.), 
and a study of phytoplankton production in relation to UV-B radiation was carried out 
along the same cruise track (Carr, in prep.).

              CLASSIFICATION OF DEBRIS

Floating debris comes in many forms and sizes, from large items such as rubber 
fenders, tree branches, and containers, to near- microscopic fragments derived from the 
degradation of larger plastic material through mechanical impact of waves after 
embrittlement and aging.

o Man-made floating debris includes all items derived directly from human activities or 
manufactured goods. Most of it is plastic, but includes glass and metal, lumber or sawn 
timber, fabrics and clothing, cardboard, oil and tarry residues, rubber items and human 
food scraps. Some types of debris are clearly more persistent in the marine 
environment than others.

o Natural floating debris includes all items which have not had an obvious human vector 
in their history. This can be subdivided into material of marine and terrestrial origins. 
Marine natural litter includes drift seaweed, seagrass, cuttlefish bones, dead fish and 
marine mammals, and feathers of seabirds. Terrestrial natural litter includes tree 
branches, dead insects, leaves, mangrove propagules, and seeds.
4

Some items can be difficult to classify, such as pumice fragments, which may be 
derived from volcanic eruptions on land or from subsea volcanic activity. For reasons 
discussed later pumice fragments are classified here as marine natural debris.

For convenience of discussion, three broad categories of oceanic litter based on the 
size of items are recognised (Gregory, 1991).

1. Megalitter includes all larger fragments and fabricated items that are large enough 
to be visually identified by a shipboard observer, i.e. measuring decimetres or more 
across. Fishing floats, fish boxes, milk crates, a diversity of plastic containers and 
bottles, chunks of styrofoam, netting, rope, strapping loops and lumber or sawn timber 
are typical examples.

2. Macrolitter includes small items, as well as fragments coming from the breakdown of 
larger items, and are up to 10cm or so across. Material of this kind is easily visible to 
the naked eye during shoreline surveys, but in ocean surveys needs to be close to the 
observing vessel to be seen. Many confectionary wrappings and convenience food 
packagings fall into this category.

3. Mesolitter is mostly material less than 5-10mm across. It includes the small 
translucent/transparent ovoidal to rounded and rod-shaped granules of virgin plastic 
resins that are the feedstock of the plastics industry, plus jagged chips of similar size 
produced through granulation and destined for recycling. Smaller, angular degradation 
and disintegration fragments that derive from embrittlement and oxidative ageing also 
fall in this category, as do individual styrofoam beads derived from the disintegration of 
larger pressed styrofoam packaging.

Natural floating debris items can also fall into the appropriate size categories above. 
For example, natural megalitter could include tree branches, logs, large pieces of drift 
seaweed, and dead whales. Natural macrolitter could include cuttlefish bones, bird 
feathers, smaller fragments of seaweed, leaves, and seagrass blades. Natural 
mesolitter could include seeds, insects, pumice fragments, small seaweed floats and 
disused siphonophore floats.

OBSERVATION METHODS

Observations were made from the Greenpeace vessel MV Greenpeace, which made the 
voyage from Ushuaia in southern Argentina to Hobart, Tasmania, via the Antarctic 
Peninsula, a westerly route approximately following the Antarctic Circle, then an erratic 
course through the Ross Sea and southern Tasman Sea. The voyage covered well 
over 11000 nautical miles and took 80 days at an average speed of nearly 6 knots.
5

Mesolitter requires the use of a fine-mesh net towed beside the ship, so that the net 
collects tiny plastic and other fragments floating on the surface of the ocean. The 
material collected can then be analysed at a later date to any level required.

Three techniques of observation were used, producing results falling into three different 
series.

General observations

General observations of any debris seen by crew on watch on the bridge, any other 
crew on a haphazard basis, and by observers in the cetacean survey. At the high 
latitudes of the Southern Ocean, it was often possible to see items throughout the 24-
hour day. For the safety of the ship a sharp lookout was also kept for icebergs and 
smaller growlers, so there was a good chance that a high proportion of megalitter items 
that were possible to see were in fact seen. There was no structure to the debris 
observation method, however. Debris recorded included mostly large material - the 
megalitter - but a few macrolitter items were included.' Observations were collated on a 
daily basis. Records were mainly of man-made items, natural items being noted only if 
spectacular.

Detailed observations

Hour-long careful observation, using polarising sun glasses to reduce glare, even in dull 
conditions. Mostly a single observer was stationed on the bow, which on the MV 
Greenpeace provides a view height of about five metres. Sometimes two observers 
were stationed on the bow, each watching for debris off on side of the ship path. On 
days when sea conditions caused heavy spray or waves to frequently cover the bow, 
observations were made from the bridge wings, which on the MV Greenpeace provides 
a view height of about seven metres. Here, when possible two people were stationed, 
one on either side of the bridge. In the often harsh climate of the Southern Ocean, 
sometimes it was feasible to observe from only one side of the ship, due to sub-zero 
temperatures and biting winds. In these cases the distance run during the time of the 
observation was divided by two for subsequent calculations.

Data were recorded on previously prepared forms, and included details of sea state, 
distance run during the hour, ship position and heading, wind speed and direction, time 
of day, and a subjective assessment of the viewing conditions. Viewing conditions 
varied considerably with the lighting and sea state. Generally one survey was done 
each day.

Each item seen was noted and described in as much detail as practical, including an
identification of the object if possible, its size, colour, and distance it passed from the ship. Debris recorded included mostly material of macrolitter size, but also any megalitter that happened to pass during the allotted time. The observations were made from the ship to the horizon, but in practice only large items would be seen beyond about 50 metres from the ship. In this survey many of the natural debris items were bird feathers, which were rarely seen beyond 10 metres from the ship. With increasing distance from the ship and in poorer viewing conditions more material would have been missed.

Collected data have been expressed in terms of number of items per 10 nautical miles run.

Debris net

Daily hour-long tows of a neuston net with 0.4m wide mouth and plastic mesh net with square openings of 1.2mm sides. The net was 3.5m long, tapering down to a collection point at its trailing end. An arrangement of float, depressor plates and paravanes, and carefully positioned towing bridle, were used in an attempt to keep the net beyond the ship's wake. In practice, however, the first wake off the'bow of the ship passed outsid the net opening. The net tracked about two to four metres off the side of the ship, about half-way along the length of the ship, and was towed from the leeward side.

A tag line, in addition to the towing rope, was attached to the net frame to lower and retrieve the net. This line was also useful to trim and control the net in conditions where it tended to rotate on its axis. When passing through floating ice the net could be lifted by the tag line over chunks of ice at the critical moment and avoid damaging collisions.

The net and frame were built onboard the M.V. Greenpeace guided by a design from Dr Murray Gregory of Auckland University, based on that described by Sameoto and Jaroszynski (1969). The net was fairly tolerant of sea state and ship speed. A critical factor is the ship's heading in relation to wind and waves. The net worked best with a sea state of 3 or less, a following sea and wind, and ship speed of around 6.5 to 8 knots.

Distance travelled was estimated from the ship's speed and tow time, and converted t area of sea surface sampled. This was corrected for sampling efficiency, to take into account the proportion of time the net was actually sampling the sea surface rather than diving or bouncing across the surface. Efficiency was measured each time the net was used by watching the net for five, one-minute intervals and counting the number of seconds the net was working correctly, averaging the readings, and making a proportion adjustment to the area sampled. Thus quantitative data could be expressed in terms of number of particles per hectare of sea surface. Net sampling efficiency ranged from 63% to 99%, with a mean of 88% efficiency. The net could be used satisfactorily in a sea state of up to 6, provided that the ship's heading was adjusted to
provide a lee on the towing side. On some occasions planned tows were cancelled 
because of sea states of 7 or more.

On retrieval of the net, the clamp closing the cod end was released and the material in 
the net was shaken and picked into a yellow plastic bin with a few centimetres of clean 
water in it, taking care to extract all particles sticking to the inside of the mesh. Debris 
particles were carefully picked off the water surface. Frequently the remaining sample 
was transferred to a red plastic bin of water and reexamined, which made transparent 
plastic fragments more visible against the dark background. The sample was then 
washed in a 0.5mm mesh wire sieve, dried, and stored in a labelled plastic bag.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Megalitter patterns - the General Observations series

A summary of data from the General Observations series is given in Appendix 1. 
Observations were made from day one out of Ushuaia. .Bird feathers, although often 
seen, were disregarded in this observation series.

Abundance

Generally megalitter was not common, and items were seen in this series only on 29 out 
of the 80 days of the expedition.

Natural megalitter, mostly seaweed, was concentrated near the start and finish of the 
expedition in the more northern latitudes, whereas man-made megalitter was seen 
mostly near and to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and again north and north-west 
of the Ross Sea.

Man-made debris was seen on 19 days, the greatest abundance occurring on day 20 
about midway between the Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea, where 7 plastic and 3 
other man-made items were recorded. The total number of man-made items seen in 
this series was 34, making an average of only 0.425 items per day.

Fishing floats

Fishing floats, and other fishing gear, were not a major component of man-made debris. 
Only 4 floats were seen, three near and west of the Peninsula and one north of the 
Ross Sea. Two were spherical about 0.3m diameter, one orange and one yellow, while 
the other two were 0.6m in diameter, one fluorescent pink and the other orange. The 
pink one had about one metre of frayed rope trailing from it.

Plastic litter

The most common plastic items seen were chunks of white styrofoam, apparently 
broken from larger pieces. Other foam plastic items included a small "s"-shaped 
packaging piece seen in Maxwell Bay on King George Island, and a few pieces of 
moulded styrofoam packaging.

Other plastic items included a small rectangular card in the Beagle Channel, three 
pieces of plastic rope each 2m long adrift in Admiralty Bay on King George Island, and 
two white plastic bottles similar to shampoo containers on the open sea, as well as the 
four fishing floats mentioned above.

Non-plastic man-made litter

In Marion Cove on King George Island a wooden pallet about one metre across was 
seen afloat. One other small piece of timber, and a possible piece of plywood, were 
seen in the open sea.

The largest non-plastic man-made item seen was a large black rubber fender 3.2 
metres long and 0.9m in diameter, which was retrieved from the Southern Ocean on day 
16 west of the Antarctic Peninsula. This was exactly the same as those carried on 
Japanese whale catcher boats seen later in the Ross Sea area, and is probably of a 
design commonly carried on cargo vessels.

Two steel 200-litre drums were seen on day 20, halfway between the Peninsula and the 
Ross Sea, and another was seen on day 72 northwest of the Ross Sea.

Natural debris

Uncountable numbers of fragments and some whole plants of the large bladder kelp 
Macrocystis pyrifera were seen in the eastern Beagle Channel, along with smaller 
numbers of fragments of the bull kelp Durvillea antarctica. Quantities of seaweed were 
not seen again until day 74, well south of New Zealand, when for three days, generally 
in the vicinity of the Antarctic Convergence, numbers of fragments and whole plants 
were recorded. A single 0.3m fragment of Durvillea was seen earlier on day 35 even 
further south. Smaller quantities were seen up to our arrival at Hobart, as well as 
fragments of other species in the Detailed Observations series.

What appeared to be a natural tree branch was seen on day 4 as we approached the 
South Shetland Islands. Northwest of the Ross Sea on day 30 a dead seabird, 
resembling an Antarctic prion, was recorded.

Close to the ice edge in the Ross Sea on day 61, a 0.3m fragment of a cream colonial 
ascidian was seen, apparently having broken away from the seafloor and floated to the
9

surface. Numerous similar ascidian fragments were seen in the outer Beagle Channel 
and in the Antarctic Peninsula area, some being recorded in the Detailed Observations 
series.

Also recorded in higher numbers in the Detailed Observations series were small dead 
fish floating on the surface in the southern Ross Sea. One was seen in this series close 
to the ice edge on day 60.

Although many penguin and other seabird feathers were seen, they were not recorded 
in this series, but were noted in the Detailed Observations series.

Macrolitter patterns - the Detailed Observations series

The Detailed Observations series commenced on 28 December 1994, or day 1 of the 
voyage from Ushuaia. Data from the hour-long Detailed Observations series tend to fall 
naturally into a number of groups, which probably relate to the proximity of sources of 
material, as well as ocean currents, fronts and eddies which may redistribute debris.

  A summary of the grouped data is given in Appendix 2. The original data contain much 
more detail, but results are presented here only for total natural items, total man-made 
items, and total plastic items in each group. Some more detail is discussed, however, in 
relation to each group. The plastic items are a subset, already included under the 
heading "Man-made".

  The distribution of the groups along the cruise track is shown in Fig. 3, with more detail 
in the Ross Sea area in Fig. 4. Because of the complex cruise track in the Ross Sea 
area, the lineal analysis of groups satisfactory on the longer legs of the cruise was 
replaced with an attempt to analyse the data to produce groups on an areal basis near 
the Ross Sea. Samples from days 24 to 73 were analysed this way.

Group 1.      Eastern Beagle Channel.

              Items per 10nm
Natural       271.3
Man-made        0.0
Plastic         0.0

This group represented coastal waters of Tierra del Fuego. Natural debris was 
abundant, consisting mainly of fragments and some whole (10m long) plants of the 
large bladder weed Macrocystis pyrifera, which grows on sheltered reefs in the Beagle 
Channel. Two pieces of  bull kelp Durvillea sp., which grows on more wave-exposed 
shores, were also seen, as well as two other seaweed clumps. Several fragments of a 
white benthic ascidian were seen, having broken free from the seafloor and floated to 
the surface. A large piece of orange sponge was attached to the base of one of the
whole Macrocystis plants. Two feathers, probably derived from seabirds, were seen.
Natural debris of terrestrial origin was rare, represented by a few leaves probably from beech trees.

No man-made debris was seen.

Group 2.     Drake Passage, north of the Antarctic Convergence.

             Items per 10nm
Natural      0.0
Man-made     1.1
Plastic      1.1

Poor sighting conditions suggest this group is not well represented by this sample from
the northern part of Drake Passage. Only one item was seen, this being a folded white
piece of thi? plastic about 30mm across. It is likely, however, that this open ocean area
contains very little debris, natural or man-made.

Group 3.     Drake Passage, south of the Antarctic Convergence.

             Items per 10nm
Natural      3.8
Man-made     0.0
Plastic      0.0

This group is from southern Drake Passage, between the Antarctic Convergence and
the South Shetland Islands. Seabird feathers are the most common items seen. Not
recorded numerically but noted were small numbers of very small (12mm) white flecks,
which were subsequently found to be penguin feathers from one or more of the smaller
species common in the Antarctic Peninsula area.

Group 4.     Gerlache Strait.

             Items per 10nm
Natural      61.3
Man-made     0.7
Plastic      0.0

This group represents inshore west coast waters of the Antarctic Peninsula. The most
common type of natural debris were floats and fragments of the large seaweed
Macrocystis pyrifera, present in the day 11 sample only. Benthic ascidians and seabird
feathers were also quite common.

The one piece of man-made debris was a fresh-looking 0.1m piece of chipped timber of
11

a type similar to that seen on cargo pallets and boxes at scientific bases in the area.

Group 5.     Southern Ocean, west of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Items per 10nm
Natural      12.6
Man-made    0.8
Plastic       0.8

This group is from the Southern Ocean west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Poor sighting conditions on several days almost certainly resulted in under-sighting of items, and hence numbers calculated are probably under-estimates.

Natural items were all seabird feathers, less than 10% of which were penguin feathers.

Man-made items were mostly small specks of styrofoam, and one 200mm-long orange plastic fragment of a small kitchen bowl or similar, with algal staining suggesting it had been afloat for a considerable time.

Group 6.     Southern Ocean northeast of the Ross Sea.

Items per 10nm
Natural      544.8
Man-made    0.5
Plastic       0.5

This area contained large numbers of penguin feathers and relatively few feathers of other seabirds. The second day produced particularly high counts (828 penguin feathers, 11 other feathers, in one hour) despite only moderate to poor sighting conditions. The penguin feathers were large, suggesting they were from one of the larger penguin species, perhaps emperors.

The man-made item was a small styrofoam fragment.

Group 7     Area north and northwest of the Ross Sea.

Items per 10nm
Natural      25.6
Man-made    0.0
Plastic       0.0
Unknown     0.1

Fairly high numbers of non-penguin seabird feathers characterised this area, peaking at
12

58.3 per 10nm at the day 44 sampling site. Moderate but variable numbers of penguin 
feathers also occurred within this group, but appeared to be less widespread than the 
feathers from flying birds. They seemed to have their centres of abundance in the same 
areas where other bird feathers were most abundant.

No man-made items were seen.

Group 8.     Present in a zone surrounding the Group 7 area

                Items per 10nm
Natural         4.6   
Man-made      0.1
Plastic           0.1
Unknown        0.2

Low numbers of seabirds feathers characterised this group, which formed a zone 
around the Group 7 area. Penguin feathers were present at low but variable density 
only in the southern and eastern parts of the zone. A fragment of each of the brown 
seaweeds Macrocystis and Durvillea were seen on day 33, the southernmost sighting 
of brown algae in this area. Two small dead fish were seen close inshore on day 58.

The only man-made item seen was one small piece of styrofoam, which occurred at the 
westernmost station on day 31.

Group 9.     Ross Sea, northwest of McMurdo Sound.

                Items per 10nm
Natural         62.1
Man-made      0.0
Plastic           0.0
Unknown        1.9

This group was represented by a single sample close inshore , over a small rise in the 
seabed off Granite Harbour, northwest of McMurdo Sound.

The most unusual feature was a count of 31 small dead white fish from 50 to 150mm 
long floating on the surface. Two days earlier while drifting at the ice edge in McMurdo 
sound, a similar fish was seen swimming just below grease ice, and a second was seen 
to drift up from well below the surface and lie dead on the surface. It seemed that the 
fish were being trapped in anchor ice on the seabed and floating to the surface, where 
skuas and other birds could reach them for food.

Also common were small penguin feathers, with only a few feathers from other birds.  A 
small number of dead jellyfish and jellyfish fragments were also seen.
13

No man-made items were seen. An unknown item may have been a fragment of a 
benthic colonial ascidian.

Group 10.   Ross Sea , south of Franklin Island.

        Items per 10nm
Natural     0.0
Man-made    0.0
Plastic     0.0

Nothing was seen in this survey , which was hampered by about 50% cover of 
pancake ice.

Group 11.   North of the Ross Sea, and north of the Group 8 zone.

        Items per 10nm
Natural     0.4
Man-made    0.0
Plastic     0.0
Unknown     0.2

This group occurs in a zone along the northern edge of the Group 8 zone, and contains 
almost no natural debris and no man-made debris. One non-penguin feather was seen 
on day 35.

The sample sites for days 40, 55 and 69 overlap with other sites attributed to Groups 7 
and 8, which were replicated sites for plankton work (Carr, in prep.). The 16 and 12 day 
time intervals between successive samplings probably led to the replacement of the 
original floating debris population through the action of wind and currents, thus bringing 
a complicating time factor into the analysis which was not evident at other sites.

Group 12.   North of Ross Sea.

        Items per 10nm
Natural     0.0
Man-made    1.8
Plastic     1.8

No natural items were present in this group, which is clearly very similar to Group 11 
except for the presence of a single man-made styrofoam fragment in each of the two 
samples.
14

Group 13.   West of Macquarie Island, and crossing Antarctic Convergence.

Items per 10nm
Natural      13.8
Man-made      0.8
Plastic        0.8

Moderate numbers of fragments and some whole plants of the bull kelp Durvillea 
characterise this group, which straddles the Antarctic Convergence. Several fragments 
and plants had clumps of mature goose barnacles growing on them, suggesting they 
had been afloat on the open sea for some time. It appears that a considerable quantity 
of natural debris is concentrated in a band roughly corresponding to the Antarctic 
Convergence (see also General Observations and Debris Net samples). 
Other natural debris seen in this Group included a feather, and a natural wooden stick 
0.7m long.

Man-made debris was represented by a rectangular chunk of styrofoam sheet about 
20mm thick and 150mm long.

Group 14.   South Tasman Sea.

Items per 10nm
Natural       1.4
Man-made      0.0
Plastic        0.0
Unknown       0.7

Here there was a much lower density of fragments of Durvillea. The first of the three 
sampling days of this group produced a storm with sea state of 9, so it is very likely that 
some items, probably seaweed fragments, were missed. On the last sampling day 
numbers of living jellyfish were seen, as well as a sunfish, suggesting we were in a 
different water mass. One feather was also seen on the last day of this group.

No man-made items were seen.

Group 15.   Entrance to Derwent River, Hobart.

Items per 10nm
Natural       7.8
Man-made      0.0
Plastic        0.0
Unknown       1.3
15

This group represented coastal waters near Hobart, and contained small numbers of 
fragments and clumps of an undetermined large brown seaweed. Two tree leaves were 
also seen.

No man-made items were seen, although an unknown item may have been a piece of 
white paper beneath the surface, or a sheet of dead and sunbleached sea-lettuce, or a 
sunbleached red seaweed.

Mesolitter patterns - the Debris Net series

A summary of mesolitter from the Debris Net series is presented in Appendix 3. 
The original data contain much more detail but are not presented fully here.

The debris net was not ready for use before 10 January 1995, on day 14 of the 
expedition, and about one and a half days travel west of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Abundance

Natural mesolitter occurred in 30 of the 41 tows,made throughout the voyage, whereas 
man-made mesolitter was collected on only 15 of the tows. On the other hand only 7 of 
the tows contained no mesolitter at all.

Quantities of natural mesolitter were highly variable, usually very low, but on two 
occasions reached very high densities of 391 and 288 particles per hectare, on day 23 
(northeast of the Ross Sea) and day 74 (south of Macquarie Island).

Man-made mesolitter was usually absent, and reached a maximum density of 8.7 
particles per hectare, on day 20, surprisingly in about as remote a part of the Southern 
Ocean as is possible to reach.

Plastic mesolitter

The most frequently collected form of plastic mesolitter was individual white styrofoam 
beads, usually partly crushed presumably by continual battering by waves. They were 
probably derived from larger chunks of styrofoam packing, which are made by pressing 
together thousands of spherical styrofoam beads into a mould.

There appeared to be a correlation between the three series of debris observations in 
respect of styrofoam fragments. Usually when styrofoam chunks were observed in the 
General Observations series, smaller fragments or individual beads would appear on or 
near the same day in either the Detailed Observations series or in the debris net.

For example, styrofoam beads occurred in the net on days 18, 20 and 21 (no tow day 
19), with the highest density (8.7 per hectare) on day 20. In the General Observations

series, day 20 also produced the highest number (5) of chunks of styrofoam clearly
visible from the ship on any day. In the Detailed Observations series foam fragments
were recorded on days 20, 21 and 22.

Styrofoam beads occurred in the net also on days 31 and 33 (no tow day 32), and in the
General Observations series foam chunks were seen on days 30, 31 and 33. In the
Detailed Observations series a foam fragment was seen on day 31.

It would seem that a sizeable chunk of styrofoam could spawn-off a considerable swarm
of smaller particles, which remained concentrated in the general area of the larger piece
for some time, only gradually dispersing.

In the vicinity of the Antarctic Convergence near Macquarie Island styrofoam beads
were also collected in the net (3 beads representing 8.0 particles per hectare, day 74b).
in the same area where pumice granules and seaweed fragments were abundant.

Only one hard plastic particle was collected in the net in the Southern Ocean. A small
blue plastic fragment was collected on day 26, north of the Ross Sea. 4mm long and
smoothly rounded, this particle had a slightly chalky surface and appeared to have b[?]

North of the convergence, in the south Tasman Sea, there was a sudden increase in
hard plastic particles collected in the net. Tows on days 76 and 78 (no tow day 77)
each produced single particles, with two being collected on day 79 just one day from
Hobart. Two of these fragments were white, one blue, and one pale yellow. None
appeared to be virgin plastic pellets as used as feedstock in the plastics industry, but
were either chipped plastic for recycling, or break-down products of larger embrittled
floating plastic objects. None were sharply angular, but had varying degrees of
rounding of the corners.

Non-plastic man-made mesolitter and oil

A small speck of hard tar was collected in the net on day 22, in a very remote part of the
Southern Ocean. Three tiny specks of black oil were found on the net mesh after the
tow on day 36 north of the Ross Sea. This site is probably close to the shipping rout[?]
from Australia to the Ross Sea. With Antarctic supply ships, research ships, tourist
ships, a Greenpeace vessel and a whaling fleet working in the area over the summer,
there were plenty of possible sources of oil contamination.

Natural debris

Natural mesolitter consisted almost entirely of feathers and pumice granules.

Feathers were widespread but variable in net hauls across the Southern Ocean, but
17

there were clearly some "hot spots" where they were more common. Feathers were 
more often seen in the Detailed Debris observations, however, than caught in the debris 
net.

By far the greatest density of feathers occurred on day 23, when 181 feathers collected 
represented 391.3 feathers per hectare. Nearly all were large penguin feathers, and 
many were still attached in small clumps to some sort of skin residue. A much smaller 
peak of feathers, mainly from large penguins, occurred on day 70, north of the Balleny 
Islands, when 17 feathers collected represented 33.3 per hectare.

Pumice grains ranging from about 2 to 6mm in diameter occurred in two distinct areas. 
Firstly, on days 16, 17 and 18 increasing numbers were collected, reaching a peak of 
25.3 grains per hectare. These grains had a greenish and/or brownish colouring 
apparently due to encrusting algae. A few grains were then found on day 20, which 
were perfectly clean. Further west no grains were found. It is possible that we had 
been approaching a submarine source (there are many seamounts in this area, some 
still active) downstream (east) of which grains had time to accumulate an algal coat, but 
close to the source the grains were fresh. We may then have gone beyond the source 
in a westerly direction.

The second major area in which pumice grains were found was the area south of 
Macquarie Island, and particularly close to the Antarctic Convergence. Moderate 
quantities (30-40/ha) occurred over a large area between Macquarie and the Balleny 
Islands, but pumice grains became particularly abundant in the vicinity of the 
Convergence, reaching a peak of 288.2 per hectare.

Three net tows were made on day 74 to closely document changes across the 
Convergence and the results can be seen in Appendix 3. Sea surface temperatures 
measured with a thermometer at 6-hourly intervals recorded a rise from 4.5 degrees C 
to 8.3 degrees C, the major temperature rise associated with the Antarctic 
Convergence, over a 12-hour period early on 13 March 1995, or day 75 of the voyage. 
It appeared that the concentration of pumice was in fact a little south of the position of 
the major temperature change.

The only other natural mesolitter item collected in the net was the "parachute" off an 
aerially dispersed seed found on day 79, one day out of Hobart.

Biological associations with marine debris

Compared with associations with debris in warmer waters (Grace, 1994), Southern 
Ocean floating debris is relatively free of associated biological material.

The large rubber fender collected on day 16 had a 50mm growth of green filamentous 
algae at and below the waterline.
18

A few other items had a greenish colour probably associated with an algal film growing 
on them. This was seen on a fragment of a plastic bowl on day 21, as well as on some 
pumice grains on days 16 to 18.

Pumice grains near the Antarctic Convergence south of Macquarie Island had 
numerous small goose barnacles growing on them. Of 170 pumice grains examined 
from this area, 38, or 22.4%, had barnacles growing on them.

Clumps of large goose barnacles were also seen growing on fragments of bull kelp 
Durvillea near and north of the Antarctic Convergence. It is not likely that barnacles 
could grow on the bull kelp whilst it is attached to the rocks in its normal rocky shore 
habitat, because of the violence of the movement of the kelp in the waves. They 
probably colonise the seaweed only after it has broken free from the shore and is 
drifting on the ocean surface, where movement would be more gentle.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Field work for this study was carried out on the 1994-95 Antarctic Expedition voyage of 
the MV Greenpeace. I wish to thank Greenpeace Communications and Greenpeace 
International for the opportunity to join the expedition. I wish to thank the Master, Arne 
Sorensen, the mates and crew of the MV Greenpeace for assisting the project where 
they could, particularly adjusting the ships speed and course when necessary to enable 
the debris net to be towed.

The debris net itself was constructed in 1993 by crew on the SV Rainbow Warrior, and 
its new aluminium frame built on the MV Greenpeace by Assistant Engineer Anders 
Gram (alias Shorty). Shorty also took a major part in fine tuning the rigging and details 
of the net during a period of evolution when we were trying to improve the net's
19

performance. Tom Briggs sorted out a suitable towing system of ropes, and earlier took 
a great weight off my mind when he found the net when I was rapidly coming to the 
conclusion it had been lost forever.

The General Observations series was assisted greatly by all crew members who 
reported sightings to me, and especially the watch-keepers on the bridge who, while 
looking for potentially hazardous icebergs and growlers, also noted any debris items 
they saw. Occasional help with Detailed Debris observations was given by Chris 
Pierpoint and Majoge van Vliet.

The tolerance of the cooks Martin Friemuller and Sara McNab was much appreciated 
when I was towing the net on the starboard side, as I had to ask them to leave the plug 
in the kitchen sink for the duration of the tow to avoid getting a preview of the nights 
dinner in my net sample.

Thanks also go to Kieran Mulvaney, campaigner in charge of the expedition, for 
smoothing the way to make things happen when needed. Hans Hoek kindly assisted by 
preparing base maps for final diagrams. John Frizell provided timely encouragement 
and moral support from afar, and made sure that this report was finally completed. 
Valuable advice, discussion and literature was much appreciated from Dr Murray 
Gregory of the University of Auckland.

Finally I must say a big thankyou to my wife Linda, who lost me for the whole summer, 
including Christmas and New Year, my big "five-oh" birthday, Vanessa's first birthday 
and Shelley's 4th!  Her understanding and tolerance "for the cause" are legendary.
