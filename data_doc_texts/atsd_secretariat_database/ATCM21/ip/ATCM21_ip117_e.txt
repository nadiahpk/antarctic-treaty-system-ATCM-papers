UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION

THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, CONSULTATIVE PARTIES TO THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY, EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN ON THE LACK OF A
SECRETARIAT. THIS SITUATION MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE A BETTER
AND MORE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THE TREATY. THE IMMINENT ENTRY
INTO FORCE OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY IS AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR OF CONCERN WITH
REGARD TO THIS MATTER.

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THESE CONCERNS, AS WELL AS THE FINAL
REPORT OF THE XVII ATCM, VENICE, 1992 (PARAGRAPH 47) WHICH REFERS
TO THE INSERTION OF LATIN AMERICA IN THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY, THE ABOVE MENTIONED COUNTRIES WISH TO
STATE THE FOLLOWING:

* AN APPROPITATE GEOGRAPHICAL BALANCE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE VARIOUS ANTARCTIC FORA IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE
PRESERVATION AND STRENGTHENING OF THE SPIRIT OF HARMONY AND
COOPERATION WHICH HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED THE INITIATIVES AND
ACTIVITIES OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM MEMBERS.

* IN THIS REGARD, THE CANDIDACY OF BUENOS AIRES AS HEADQUARTERS
FOR THE SECRETARIAT OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY IS THE RESULT OF A
LENGTHY PROCESS AND HAS OBTAINED THE ALMOST UNANIMOUS
SUPPORT OF THE CONSULTATIVE PARTIES. THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES REITERATE THEIR FIRM SUPPORT TO THIS CANDIDACY, AS
THEY HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

* THE CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE OR INTERIM HEADQUARTERS
WOULD ONLY DELAY, UNNECESSARILY, THE ATTAINMENT OF A SOLUTION
DESIRED BY ALL PARTIES.

* THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES EXPRESS THEIR HOPE THAT, WITH
ADDITIONAL EFFORTS BY ALL DELEGATIONS, A PROMPT AND
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION MAY BE ACHIEVED WITH REGARD TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT AND THE
DESIGNATION OF BUENOS AIRES AS ITS HEADQUARTERS.
