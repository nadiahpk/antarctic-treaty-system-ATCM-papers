The IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean,

Noting the success over the last decade of a number of WCRP and IGBP programs related to understanding of 
climate,

Noting that the JSC for WCRP has requested CLIVAR to work with Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS) and 
Antarctic Sea Ice Processes, Ecosystems and Climate (SCAR-ASPECT) to develop a specific Southern Ocean sea-ice 
programme,

Recognizing the need to maintain a clear focus on critical climate issues through a small number of well-supported 
research efforts,

Expresses its strong support and affirmation of present efforts underway in WCRP and IGBP to advance our 
understanding of climate and climate change;

Recommends that the IOC Executive Council calls on member states to make long-term commitments to WCRP and 
IGBP and to strengthen their participation in these research programmes;

Noting the success of the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter mission, the confirmation of a follow-on mission 
and that the utility of altimetric data will be greatly enhanced by the availability of a high resolution geoid,

distribution, and movement at high spatial resolution,
IOC/SOC-VI/3
Annex II - page 3

Recommends that the IOC Executive Council encourages the satellite agencies to undertake a dedicated gravity mission;

Also recommends that the IOC Executive Council encourages the Member States of IOC to support research programs on sea-ice remote sensing, and that IOC invites the satellite operating agencies to enhance availability of SAR data on Southern Ocean ice;

Noting that the forthcoming requirements for operational use of high-resolution satellite data such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and ocean colour will place a greatly increased load on ground receiving stations around the Southern Ocean,

Recommends that IOC collaborate with WCRP and WMO to conduct a review of both the distribution and capability of ground receiving stations covering the Southern Ocean;

Noting the paucity of long-time series observations in the Southern Ocean,

Recognizing the need for information on the time variability of a wide-range of ocean parameters,

Emphasizes the need for continued development of repeated observations for all Southern Ocean regions; and therefore Recommends that the IOC Executive Council invites:

(i)    the Joint Committee for IGOSS, in consultation with COMNAP and SCAR, to coordinate among member states development of a comprehensive Southern Ocean ship of opportunity program using polar supply and research ships;

(ii)   the IOC Group of Experts on GLOSS to establish a protocol for datum control at selected Southern Ocean tide gauges;

(iii)  DBCP and JSC for WCRP to develop a long-term program for Southern Ocean drifting buoys; and

(iv)   Member States to establish further time-series stations and sections (hydrographic, water level, and biogeochemical, etc.);

Recognizing the progress in the understanding and prediction of climate variability on seasonal to interannual time-scales by inclusion of the upper ocean in research and observational networks and coupled modelling in the TOGA programme of WCRP,

Recommendation IOCSOC-VI.3
SOUTHERN OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR LIVING RESOURCES

The IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean,

Recognizing that the unique physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the Antarctic seas provide major 
opportunities to expand fundamental knowledge of the region and help understanding of global issues such as climate 
change, ocean circulation, ocean productivity, and pollution,

Noting the continuing concern over the conservation of the Southern Ocean ecosystems and their living resources and 
the world-wide awareness over climate change as a result of increased levels of CO_(2), and the depletion of stratospheric 
ozone, as witnessed by the initiation of several scientific programs to address these concerns,

Aware that the wealth of information on the physics, chemistry and biology of the Southern Ocean gained from several 
national and international programs has significantly advanced our understanding of the ecology of the Southern Ocean,

Noting, however, that these programmes have identified serious gaps in our knowledge which need to be addressed,

Recommends that IOC Executive Council urges Member States of IOC and relevant international organizations to 
undertake investigation of:

(i)   The linkages between the physical and the chemical environments with the structure and dynamics of the 
      marine ecosystem, including investigations on small and large-scale spatial distribution as well as seasonal and 
      interannual variability (cr. SO-JGOFS, SO-GLOBEC, CCMLAR, IWC);

(ii)  The role of sea-ice in affecting the productivity of the Southern Ocean, as well as the contribution of sea-ice 
      communities to the overall production process of the Southern Ocean (cf. EASIZ, ASPECT);

(iii) The levels of UV-B and their effects on marine biota including impacts on biogeochemical cycles and 
      productivity [c.f. ASPECT, SO-JGOFS, SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their role in Climate)];

(iv)  The spatial and seasonal distribution of trace elements (e.g. Fe), and their effects on the organisms (e.g. SO-
      JGOFS);

(v)   A suite of ecosystem models for lower trophic levels (e.g. phytoplankton), as well as for krill life history 
      stages, other zooplankton and top predators, which couple environmental and biological variability at 
      appropriate scales (e.g. SO-JGOFS, SO-GLOBEC, CCAMLR).


Recommendation IOCSOC-VI.4
POLLUTION AND MONITORING IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

The IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean,

Noting that although at present the Southern Ocean does not have a pressing pollution problem, it is important to 
identify early any pollution problem, when it is still practical to take measures to remedy such problem,

Taking into account that an adequate understanding of global and local pollution processes and forecast capabilities 
could only be developed if long-term observations and their data are available,

Recognizing the need to undertake coastal and oceanic monitoring to evaluate processes with the aim to achieve long-
term datasets for the development of prediction capabilities and the need for references and/or calibration of 
instruments and laboratories in countries bordering the Southern Ocean,
IOC/SOC-VI/3
Annex II - page 5

Recommends that as a first step the Joint Scientific and Technical Committee for GOOS establish a pilot project for 
the GOOS Health of the Ocean Module in the Drake Passage area, including southern coastal regions of South America 
and the Antarctic Peninsula in close collaboration with Managers of National Antarctic Programmes;

Recommends that the Committee for GIPME work with Member States to establish baseline pollution monitoring sites 
in the Southern Ocean;

Recommends that the Committee for GIPME evaluate the use of biological samples as pollution indicators.

                                                                Recommendation IOCSOC-VI.5 
                  GLOBAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (GOOS) AND DATA MANAGEMENT

The IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean,

Recognizing that the emergent Global Ocean Observing System will provide a basic suite of operational oceanographic 
data for a wide variety of user groups,

Recognizing the need for a broad spectrum of input to GOOS planning and particularly specialized advice on Southern 
Ocean requirements to realize a program responsive to the user community,

Recognizing the need for broader interaction and collaboration between and among research and operational 
oceanography communities,

Noting that the Global Ocean Observing System will serve as a useful framework to promote specific Southern Ocean 
observations for all disciplines and that some Southern Ocean programs serve as fine examples upon which to build 
GOOS plans,

Noting in particular that CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring is especially commended as a model for planning and 
implementation of the developing LMR module of GOOS,

Recommends that IOC should promote wherever possible continued communication between and among GOOS and 
existing Southern Ocean research and operational programmes during the intersessional period of the IOC Regional 
Committee for SOC;

Further recommends IOC should maintain a World Wide Web site for the Regional Committee on the Southern 
cean. The site should maintain a comprehensive set of Southern Ocean links as edited by the Chairman and the 
Secretariat of the IOC Regional Committee for SOC. To complement this effort, participating member states are 
encouraged to maintain Web sites with specific information such as cruise plans and national Southern Ocean planning 
activities;

Noting also the need for improved coordination and access to a wide variety of Southern Ocean data sets,

Recommends that the RNODC for the Southern Ocean expand its responsibilities to provide access to a wider range 
of parameters and beyond just cruise profile data. Furthermore it should coordinate its activities with those of the 
SCAR/COMNAP Antarctic Data Management System and with the major independent data management systems of 
WOCE, JGOFS and CLIVAR and to promote knowledge of and access to key historical data sets (e.g. DISCOVERY 
Investigation, BIOMASS, ISOS, POLEX-South and Data Set for "Hydrographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean");

Requests the IODE Committee in consultation with RNODC-SOC-IOC to consider the extension of northern 
boundary of the area of responsibility of RNODC;

Recommends to IOC that the complete set of recommendations from IOCSOC-VI should be summarized and annotated 
by the IOCSOC Chairman and Secretariat to constitute a "Southern Ocean Agenda for the late1990's". This Agenda 
would be made available widely and especially to all J-GOOS scientific planning teams, CLIVAR SSG, SCAR and 
SCOR for due consideration.
