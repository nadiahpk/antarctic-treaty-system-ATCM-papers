                        MEMORANDUM

Environmental Compensation Funds and the Antarctic

Establishing a fund accessible to Antarctic Treaty members to help compensate for the cost
of preventative measures and environmental damages will encourage prompt and efficient
pollution clean-up.

To assist creating this fund, a discussion of existing analogous funds was requested by the
ATCPs in conjunction with ASOC. This memorandum responds to that request.

The scope of this memorandum is limited to oil spill compensation funds which serve a
purpose closely related to the proposed Antarctic Fund. These compensation funds are
included in a broad cross-section of international agreements, U.S. federal laws and state
legislation. The funds discussed are the International Convention on the Establishment of an
International Fund for the Compensation for Oil Pollution Damages of 1971, and its 1984
and 1992 protocols; the voluntary CRISTAL fund established by oil transport companies in
1971; the collection of United States federal compensation funds prior to the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990; the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund coinciding with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990;
and numerous state funds serving to compensate for the cost of oil spill clean-up and
damages.

This memorandum limits discussion of the liability regimes accompanying these funds to how
they directly affect the operation of the funds. More extensive discussion is not required to
understand how the funds work and may confuse the issue. Neither will this memorandum
discuss the United States CERCLA ("Superfund") legislation. The provisions of CERCLA
are not analogous to the Antarctic Fund and may also confuse the issue. Furthermore, any
discussion of similar funds in other nations is left to those more familiar with their design.

The memorandum shall address how the funds are originally constituted, in other words, the
collection of contributions and their administration, moving then to the conditions required
for disbursement. It then covers reimbursement of the funds for expenditures, including
penalties for payments in arrears.

Part I of the memorandum will analyze the international agreements, both public and private.
Part II will look at the United States federal legislation before and after the Oil Pollution Act
of 1990. Part III is a survey of state funds created in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster.
Part IV will demonstrate how some of these funds have responded to actual emergencies.
Finally, Part V will attempt to summarize what has been learned and how it can be applied
to the Antarctic fund.

PART I - International Agreements

A. Public

The principle public international fund agreement for the compensation of oil pollution damages is the International Convention on Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage of 1971 (hereinafter Fund Convention). The Fund Convention was created to supplement the amounts provided by the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC) for damage suffered in the territory of a contracting State. Although the United States did not ratify either convention, it actively participated in their creation, as well as the 1984 Protocols which followed. Even at its inception, the level of liability imposed on the responsible party by the CLC was considered inadequate to cover the potential damages. Therefore, the drafters of the CLC agreed additional funding must be made available to compensate victims of oil spills.

The Fund Convention, ratified by thirty-four states, entered into force in October 1978. It was initially constituted by mandatory contributions from "persons," (defined in Art. I(2) of the CLC as "any individual or partnership or any public or private body, whether corporate or not, including a state or any of its constituent subdivisions"), which receive more than 150,000 tons of oil per year, or from the state in which these persons operated (Art. 10). The sum was a fixed rate per ton of oil received by the person in each member state (Art. 11). It became due upon ratification of the Fund Convention (Art. 14). In order for persons to access the Fund, they had to be members of the CLC.

Subsequent annual contributions vary for the individual persons covered by the CLC. They were set by the Assembly after calculating the annual budget for the Fund. Before fixing the rate of a person's contribution, any amount drawn from the Fund by the person for spill damages under or above 15 million Poincaire francs (approximately US$7.5 million) was considered (Art.12).

The total compensation available from both Conventions reached 450 million francs (approximately US$60.9 million (Art. 4(4)). No maximum fund level was included in the Fund Convention, but it was required to "maintain sufficient liquid funds" to meet its obligations (Art. 12). Annual contributions were adjusted accordingly.

The purpose of the Fund convention, as established in Article 3, was two-fold: compensation for prevention measures taken and pollution damage, and indemnification of shipowners for damage done to a member state by a ship registered in a member state. The Fund compensated victims when, a) no liability arose under the CLC, b) the owner liable for the damage under the CLC was unable to meet its liability, or, c) the damage exceeded the owner's liability under the CLC (Art. 4(1)). However, access to the Fund was denied under Article 4(2) if the damage resulted from an act of war, from a spill involving a warship or other state- owned vessel operated by a government in a noncommercial capacity, or if the damage was not caused by a ship. Contributory negligence on the part of a shipowner wholly or partially exonerated the Fund from any obligation. If the amount of damage exceeded the limits of the Fund, the amount available was prorated among valid claimants.

Article 5 called for the indemnification of shipowners for that portion of liability which
2
exceeded 1,500 francs per ships ton or 125 million francs but was less than 2,000 francs per ships ton or 210 million francs. However, no indemnification was forthcoming if damage was caused by the willful misconduct of the shipowner. In addition, the owner had to comply with the CLC and other international obligations to receive indemnification. To receive compensation or indemnification, action had to be brought within three years of the date when damage occurred (Art. 6). The action could be brought in any contracting state (Art. 7). The Director of the Fund could decide whether to bring suit against members in arrears for contributions (Art. 13(3)). Member states had to ensure prompt payment of contributions, including imposition of sanctions against the person (Art. 13(2)). The amount in arrears was to draw interest for the fund (Art. 13(1).

Administration of the fund was originally three-tiered: the Assembly, the Executive Committee, and the Secretariat. The Assembly adopted a budget, set all contribution levels, approved settlements of claims, appointed a Director and generally administered the Fund (Art. 18). The Executive Committee served as a liaison between the Assembly and Secretariat (Art. 26). The Secretariat would take action in the name of the Fund (Art. 29).

The Protocols of 1984 and 1992 dramatically streamlined the operation of the Fund Convention and strengthened its liability provisions. The United States actively negotiated an increase in liability at the 1984 conference and several other modifications.

First, the unit of account was changed from Poincare francs to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as fixed by the International Monetary Fund (1984 Protocol to the CLC, Art. VI(9a)). Second, the total compensation under both Conventions was raised to 135 million SDR (approximately US$182 million in 1984), increasing to 200 million SDR (approximately US$260 million) when three states party were involved whose combined oil receipts exceeded 600 million tons. Third, Article 5, the indemnification provision, was deleted. Fourth, the Executive Committee was abolished.

The 1992 Protocol introduced one significant addition. The largest oil-importing nations objected to the heavy burden of contributions being levied against them. Japan, in particular, supported a contributions "cap." They suggested that no single nation pay more than 25% of the total annual contributions until the total amount of oil received by the member nations exceeded 750 million tons. The member nations accepted a 27.5% cap as an amendment to Art.12. The 1992 Protocol also lowered ratification requirements to ease entry into force.

B. Private

Immediately following the adoption of the CLC and Fund Convention, oil industry parties signed a private agreement on liability for oil pollution damages and clean-up. It was designed to provide liability and some compensation in the period between signing and ratifying the Conventions. The Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement concerning Liability for Oil Pollution (TOVALOP) was signed on October 6, 1969. The Contract Regarding an Interim Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution (CRISTAL) established a fund to supplement shipowners' liability under both TOVALOP and CLC. As the title suggests, CRISTAL was intended only to exist until the Fund Convention came into force.

3
CRISTAL was administered by the Oil Companies Institute for Marine Pollution Compensation Limited (hereinafter the Institute). Oil company parties paid contributions into the fund, and the Institute made payments to reimburse clean-up expenses incurred by tanker owners and compensate persons sustaining oil pollution damage exceeding the shipowner's liability.

CRISTAL initially called for capitalization of US$5 million through "periodic calls" on oil company parties to ensure adequate funds to meet its obligations (Clause V(1) through (6)). Calls were based upon the amount of oil shipped by a particular oil company party and were set by the Institute in the name of CRISTAL.

Three basic conditions must exist for reimbursement or compensation to be paid out by CRISTAL. First, the oil carried by the vessel must have been owned by a party to CRISTAL (Clause IV(B)). Second,the tanker must be operating under TOVALOP at the time of the incident (Clause IV(A)(1)(a)). Third, the owner was liable under the CLC, or would be if it were in force at the time of the actual or threatened spill (Clause IV(A)(1)(a) and (b)).

CRISTAL would reimburse the tanker owner for clean-up or threat removal costs exceeding $125 per gross registered ton or US$10 million, whichever is less (Clause IV(C)(1) and Clause I(M)), up to US$30 million per incident (Clause IV(C)(1)). This encouraged tanker owners to provide sufficient funds for oil spill response and removal expenses.

CRISTAL compensated persons sustaining "direct provable damage" from a spill to the extent recovery is unavailable from other sources up to US$30 million per incident (Clause IV(C)(2) and (E)). "Other sources" included the owner's clean-up costs (or the amount the Institute determined should have been incurred), compensation paid by the Institute for clean-up, the owner's liability to a government under TOVALOP, and amounts recoverable from other sources. Claims exceeding this amount would be prorated (Clause (IV(D)).

Claims against CRISTAL had to be initiated within one year from the date of the incident causing damage or incurring clean-up costs. The courts and laws of England governed any disputes arising under CRISTAL's provisions (Clause IX).

The basic difference between the CLC and TOVALOP was that the latter provided recovery by State governments for threat removal or spill clean-up costs, while the CLC permitted recovery by anyone for damages incurred through an actual discharge. Additionally, TOVALOP did not allow the limits of liability to be broken through privity or actual fault. In fact, TOVALOP invoked liability only for the negligence of a tanker owner, who must prove non-negligence.

Once liability was established, the tanker owner could file a claim for compensation against the CRISTAL fund prior to those persons suffering pollution damage. In theory, they could exhaust the CRISTAL fund before spill victims entered a claim.

Although intended to be a temporary measure, when the CLC and Fund Conventions came into force in 1978, the oil industry amended TOVALOP and CRISTAL to closely reflect the conventions instead of revoking them. The revisions were not entirely successful, though.

4
CRISTAL's maximum payout was increased to $36 million. However, this amount was considered inadequate and a new tanker owner's agreement, the Pollution Liability Agreement among Tanker Owners (PLATO), was drafted. It increased CRISTAL's compensation to $200 million, including the amounts required by PLATO. The draft was not accepted by the tanker owners and did not enter into force.

In 1985, a year before CRISTAL was to expire, the tanker owners again revised its provisions to prolong its life. First, available compensation was increased and based upon ships tonnage (Clause IV(C)(5)(a)). Under this system, ships less than 5,000 gross tons would receive a maximum $45 million per incident, and those exceeding 5,000 gross tons would receive $45 million, plus $800 per ton in excess of 5,000 gross tons up to $125 million. Second, membership in TOVALOP was no longer necessary to receive compensation, but CRISTAL membership was mandatory. Third, CRISTAL was to operate in all waters, irrespective of legal regimes (Clause IV(A) and (B)). Fourth, CRISTAL was to be an exclusive remedy outside the CLC and Fund Conventions (Clause IV(C)(7)). Fifth, the stiff requirements for exhausting alternative remedies had been relaxed (Clause IV(C)(8) and (9)). While a claimant lost the right to funds from CRISTAL if proceedings were initiated against any fund established by oil companies, the claimant retained the right to prosecute a claim against those funds to the extent that CRISTAL failed to satisfy all claims (Clause IV(D)(7)).

Significantly, the right of a tanker owner to be indemnified by CRISTAL for payments made by the owner towards clean-up under the CLC or TOVALOP was deleted - the right to file claims before those sustaining damages was therefore limited. Tanker owners could make a claim against CRISTAL for those expenses, but received no preferential treatment (Clause IV(C)(6)).

PART II - United States Federal Law

A. Pre-Oil Pollution Act of 1990

Before the United States Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez catastrophe, there existed a system of federal legislation covering oil pollution. Four separate funds were created covering different geographic areas which may be affected by oil pollution: The revolving fund created by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) (33 U.S.C. 1321(k)(1)), the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP) fund (43 U.S.C. 1653), the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (OOPCF) (43 U.S.C. 1812), and the Deepwater Port Act (DPA) Fund (33 U.S.C. 1517(f)).

Each of these funds provided funding for clean-up costs, threat removal or damage compensation beyond the liability of the owner.

i. FWPCA Fund

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act (CWA), enacted in 1972,
prohibited the discharge of "oil or hazardous substances" into the navigable waters of the
United States "in such quantities as may be harmful." The Act included vessel-source and
land-source pollution. It required the President of the United States to develop a National
Contingency Plan for clean-up of onshore and offshore spill containment and clean-up
through specific regulations. This regulatory authority was later passed on to the Department
of Transportation.

The CWA empowered the President to clean-up or remove the imminent risk of a spill (33
U.S.C. 1321(c) and (d)). The government could draw upon a revolving fund created by the
CWA to pay for these actions. This fund was generated by pooling "appropriated moneys,
recovered costs, and fines" up to $35 million (33 U.S.C. 1321(k)(1)).

In the event of a vessel-source spill, or the imminent threat of a spill, the shipowner was
liable for either $150 per gross ton of the vessel involved or $250,000, whichever was
greater (33 U.S.C. 1321(f)(1)). Inland barges were liable for either $125 per gross ton or
$125,000 (33 U.S.C. 1321(f)(1)) Offshore and onshore facilities were liable to a maximum
of $50 million (33 U.S.C. 1321 (f)(2) and (3)). Liability under the CWA was strict, with
very limited defenses: act of God, act of war, negligence by the U.S. government or willful
misconduct or negligence of a third party. These defenses were unavailable if the spill was
due to willful or negligent conduct by the owner or operator. In that case, there was
unlimited liability (33 U.S.C. 1321 (f)(1)).

The United States was authorized to bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to
recover clean-up costs for which the owner was liable due to fault (33 U.S.C. 1321
(b)(6)(A)). The Secretary of the Interior was also authorized to bring suit for civil penalties,
which could not exceed $5,000 per incident. The Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator could also bring a civil action, with maximum sanctions of $50,000 per
violation, unless it was the result of willful or negligent conduct, in which case it rose to
$250,000 per incident (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(6)(B)). While the CWA did not allow private
citizens to file suit for a violation of its provisions or for failing to implement the
Contingency Plan (33 U.S.C. 1365(f)), a citizen may be able to obtain a court order for spill
clean-up due to such violations. It granted authority to the President or a state
"representative" to file suit to "restore, rehabilitate, or acquire the equivalent" of any lost
natural resources (33 U.S.C. 1321(f)(5)).

ii. TAP Fund

The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 (TAPAA) governed spills connected
to oil transported through the Alaska pipeline (43 U.S.C. 1653). TAPAA was authorized
to create and maintain a fund for the mandatory clean-up of oil by the U.S. government (43
U.S.C. 1653(c)(4)). The TAP fund was financed by a $.05 per barrel tax on oil loaded onto
tankers at the Valdez, Alaska, terminal (43 U.S.C. 1653(c)(5). The tax was assessed against
the Alyeska Consortium, comprised of the seven oil companies with the right of way to
construct the pipeline (43 U.S.C. 1653(b) and (c)(5)-"the owner of the oil at the time it is
loaded"). Collection of the tax ceased when the fundreached $100 million,and resumed when
it fell below that level (43 U.S.C. 1653(c)(5)).
Alyeska administered the fund, subject to annual audit by the government (43 U.S.C. 
1653(c)(4)(A)).

The TAPAA required the shipowner to bear the costs of any spill, including clean-up costs, 
up to $14 million (43 U.S.C. 1653(c)(3)). The right of way holder, Alyeska, had potentially 
unlimited liability, but only if the government could prove it was negligent (43 U.S.C. 
1653(a)(2), (b) and (c)). Once vessel-owner liability is exhausted, the TAP fund may be 
called upon to pay the excess costs of the spill, including economic losses (i.e., lost profits), 
up to $100 million (43 U.S.C. 1653(c)(3)). If the TAP fund were utilized, Alyeska would 
replenish the fund up to its $100 million ceiling by reinstituting the tax.

While TAPAA did not authorize the government to order clean-up by a private party, it did 
allow the government to recover for natural resource damages (43 U.S.C. 1653(a)(2)). 
Recovery may come from the TAP fund, which would then be subrogated to the claim of the 
recipient, either private party or government.

iii. DPA Fund

The Deepwater Port Act (DPA), promulgated in 1974, was intended to cover "fixed or 
floating manmade structures other than vessels" located beyond the territorial sea of the U.S., 
which at the time was a distance of three miles from shore, used as a port or terminal for 
loading or unloading oil (33 U.S.C. 1502(10)). DPA imposed strict liability for clean-up 
costs and damages resulting from a spill from the port facilities or from any vessel traveling 
to or from a deepwater port (33 U.S.C. 1517(d)). The port licensee's liability for damages 
and clean-up was limited to $50 million and the vessel owner's liability was limited to $150 
per gross ton up to $20 million (33 U.S.C. 1517(d) and (e)). Unlimited liability will be 
imposed for gross negligence or willful misconduct by either the vessel owner or the licensee 
(33 U.S.C. 1517(d) and (e)).

If damages exceeded liability limits, recovery could be made from the DPA Fund by private 
individuals or the U.S. Attorney General representing a class of property owners (33 U.S.C. 
1517(i)). The DPA fund was created through a $.02 per barrel levy on vessel owners for 
oil loaded or unloaded at a deepwater port (33 U.S.C. 1517(f)). The fund covered damages 
up to $100 million (33 U.S.C. 1517(f)(3)). Procedures for filing claims were very similar 
to the other funds. The government was allowed to file suit for the "restoration and 
rehabilitation" of natural resource damages (33 U.S.C. 1517(i)). Jurisdiction was given to 
the Federal District Court in which the defendant resides or the nearest adjacent coastal state 
(33 U.S.C. 1518(e)). However, DPA did not preempt any state laws, therefore proceedings 
for violation of adjacent coastal state law could be nstituted in state courts 33.S.C. 
1517(k)(1)).

iv. OOPCF

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) was amended in 1978 to address the 
increased risks of oil pollution. The amendments applied to owners and operators of any 
offshore facility on the Outer Continental Shelf and vessels operating in adjacent waters or 
7
carrying oil from the facilities (43 U.S.C. 1811(5) and 1814(a)).

Damage liability for vessel owners was limited to $300 per gross ton or $250,000, whichever was greater, unless the owner or operator of the vessel failed to cooperate or assist in the clean-up, in which case there was no upper limit (43 U.S.C. 1814(b)(1). Facility liability for damages was limited to $35 million (43 U.S.C. 1814(b)(2)). However, there was absolute liability for the facility and vessel owner for the costs of clean-up and removal incurred by the federal or state governments (43 U.S.C. 1814(d)). No liability attached if the spill resulted from an act of God, an act of war, or an unavoidable natural phenomenon.

The amendments also established the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (OOPCF). The OOPCF was funded by a $.03 per barrel tax on oil obtained from the Outer Continental Shelf paid by the owner of the oil at the time of production and all fees collected in the administration of the OSCLA (43 U.S.C. 1812 (b) and (d)(1)). Failure to pay any fee owed under the OSCLA was subject to a fine of up to US$10,000. The OOPCF had a US$200 million ceiling, available immediately for clean-up and damage claim settlement (43 U.S.C. 1812(c)(1) through (3)). (3)

While compensation paid by the OOPCF was limited by its US$200 million ceiling, unlimited liability was imposed against the fund for economic losses, such as lost profits or tax revenues (43 U.S.C. 1813(a) and 1814(1)). Economic claims were available to any claimant other than the vessel owner or offshore facility operator.

Individual owners or lessees of property damaged by an oil spill from an offshore facility were authorized to make a claim or bring a class action with the U.S. Attorney General (43 U.S.C. 1813(b)(2) and (7)). The federal government was given a private cause of action for damages and the President or state government could sue to restore or replace natural resources (43 U.S.C. 1813(b)(3) and (5)). Foreign parties could make a claim if certain conditions were met (43 U.S.C. 1813(b)(6)(A) through (D)).

B. Federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF)

Following the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States Congress quickly passed the 1990 Oil Pollution Act (OPA or the Act). The existing legislation proved woefully inadequate to respond to such a massive disaster, so Congress conducted a general housecleaning and consolidation of the various federal oil spill laws. Title I of the OPA establishes liability for discharges or the threat of discharge of oil from any source within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the U.S. (33 U.S.C. 2701(8)). This liability is "the standard of liability which obtains under section 311 of the Clean Water Act," explained in the Conference Report as strict, joint and several (33 U.S.C. 2701(17). Liability attaches to "the responsible party," defined to include owners, operators or corporations (33 U.S.C. 2701(32)), and cannot be transferred (33 U.S.C. 2710). Nor does the OPA preempt state law or prevent state legislatures from establishing different standards of liability (33 U.S.C. 2718).

Responsible parties are liable for oil spill removal costs and damages (33 U.S.C. 2702(a)). Removal costs include the costs incurred by government entities or by private parties acting consistently with the National Contingency Plan from the CWA (33 U.S.C. 2702(b)(1)(A) 
8
and (B)). This is the first time recovery for removal costs is not limited to the federal government, encouraging private parties to assist in containment and clean-up. However, this means that although a claimant may have a valid judgment under state law, no recovery from the OSLTF will be available unless claim fits within the scope of this definition of removal costs.

The categories of recoverable damages have been expanded as well. The Act deletes a limitation which occurred in case law requiring the claimant show physical damage, exemplified by the authorization of damages for loss of profits or earning capacity. Recovery can be made 1) by a government trustee for damages to natural resources measured by the cost of "restoration, rehabilitation or replacement," plus the diminution in value of the resources after restoration; 2) by any party for damages to real or personal property; 3) for loss of subsistence use of natural resources; 4) for lost revenues to a government entity; 5) for lost profits or earning capacity; and 6) for increased net costs of providing public services during or after removal activities recoverable by a state or local government (33 U.S.C. 2702(b)(2)).

The Act also expressly overrules the 139-year-old Limited Liability Act (46 U.S.C. 181-189). This act had restricted claims against vessel owners to the value of the vessel and cargo involved. Any claim brought under the OPA would not be affected by this provision (33 U.S.C. 2702(a)-"notwithstanding" clause).

Defenses to liability are restricted to an act of God, an act of war, an act or omission by an unrelated third party or any combination of these conditions (33 U.S.C. 2703(a)). Moreover, the third party defense is contingent upon the responsible party proving they acted with due care regarding the spill and took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions by the third party (33 U.S.C. 2703(a)). Responsible parties void any defense under the OPA if they fail to report a spill or fail to cooperate and assist in clean-up, which also subjects them to criminal and civil penalties (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(5)).

The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was created to provide another source of money to pay necessary expenses for oil spill removal or damages. While the responsible party must pay for clean-up and damages, that liability may be limited to the greater of $1,00 per gross ton or $10 million for tank vessels greater than 3,000 gross tons, $1,200 per gross ton or $2 million for tank vessels 3,000 gross tons or less, and $600 per gross ton or $500,000 for other vessels (33 U.S.C. 2704). For offshore facilities, liability is limited to $75 million plus all removal costs (33 U.S.C. 2704(a)). For onshore facilities and deepwater ports, the limit is $350 million. These limits are unavailable in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct (33 U.S.C. 2704(c)).

The OSLTF is capitalized through several sources: a $.05 per barrel tax on oil (26 U.S.C. 4611(c)(2)(B)), excess natural resource damages recovered by the government (33 U.S.C. 2706(f)), amounts recovered by the OSLTF through subrogation (33 U.S.C. 2715), the amounts remaining in the FWPCA, TAP, DPA and OOPC funds transferred to the OSLTF (26 U.S.C. 9509) and penalties collected under the CWA, DPA and the TAPAA (26 U.S.C. 9509(b)(8)). The tax is paid by the oil refiner receiving the oil, the person storing the oil for consumption or use, or by the person using or exporting the oil (26 U.S.C. 4611(d)).
Payment from the OSLTF occurs only in specific instances. It will pay only when the responsible party cannot be identified; when the responsible party can successfully defend against a charge of liability; when the responsible party can invoke liability limits and claims exceed those limits; when the responsible party is not subject to U.S. jurisdiction; or when a responisble party is insolvent or otherwise cannot meet its obligations under the OPA (26 U.S.C. 9509).

The OSLTF may still limit its obligation in several ways. First, there is a $1 billion per incident ceiling on recovery. Second, only half of this amount may go to compensate for natural resource damages (26 U.S.C. 9509(c)(2)), and recovery is available only to natural resource trustees, defined as federal and state governments, Indian tribes and foreign governments. Moreover, while the President is given authority to access the OSLTF, use of the funds is generally subject to appropriation by Congress (33 U.S.C 2752 -- up to $50 million is available for emergency use without Congressional approval). The OSLTF will pay for removal costs, up to $250,000, to states for removal costs incurred, costs incurred by a natural resource trustee, removal costs for a discharge from a foreign offshore discharge, uncompensated removal costs, uncompensated damages, federal administration, operational and personnel costs and costs incurred under other federal laws (33 U.S.C. 2712). As a result, state claims against the OSLTF are of a more limited scope than those against the responsible party.

Administration of the OSLTF lies with the Coast Guard's National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC). While it is part of the Coast Guard's response system, the NPFC is an independent office which manages the $1 billion trust fund. The primary purpose of the NPFC ensures the availability of funds for immediate action against oil spills and to assign natural resource damages. Second, it administers the OPA's claims provisions for damages caused by an oil spill. Third, the NPFC recovers from the responsible parties the costs and damages paid by the OSLTF. Additionally, it manages the thousands of certificates of financial responsibility required for tanker vessels.

Claims by private parties against the OSLTF must follow the procedures set forth in 33 U.S.C. 2713 and 2714. The President must first identify the responsible party. The responsible party then has fifteen days to publish a procedure for payment of claims, otherwise the President will provide them for the responsible party. The President will advertise the availability of the OSLTF for recovery if the responsible party and their guarantor deny responsibility within five days of being designated the responsible party, if the spiller is a public vessel or if the spiller cannot be identified (33 U.S.C. 2714(c)). Claims must be brought to the responsible party. If a claim is not settled by the responsible party within ninety days, the claimant may choose between filing suit in the appropriate court or presenting the claim to the OSLTF.

No claims will be paid by the OSLTF while a court is considering the same claim. Claims brought under the OPA are to be heard by the appropriate federal district court (33 U.S.C. 2717(b)). However, cases involving removal costs and damages may also be considered under state law in state courts (33 U.S.C. 2717(c)). The OPA establishes a three-year statute of limitations for claims brought seeking damages, removal costs, contributions or subrogation (33 U.S.C. 2717(f)(1) through (4)).

                                                                                                                                10
PART III - State Funds

Individual states within the United States of America have established separate funds to help pay for damages and removal costs in the event of an oil spill on their shores. Currently Alaska (AS 46.08.005-.080), California (Ann.Cal.Gov.Code 8670.46-.62), Florida (F.S.A. 376.021-.21), Maine (M.R.S.A. 541-552), Maryland (MD Envir. 4-401-501), New Hampshire (NH R.S.A. 146-A:1- D:5), New York (NY Navig. 179-190-a), Oregon (O.R.S. 468B.395-.500) and Texas (TX Nat.Res. 40.151-.301) have created comprehensive hazardous waste or oil spill liability and recovery regimes which establish independent funds to aid in compensation. Rather than examine each fund separately, this section will give a general overview to key aspects of these funds.

A. Capitalization

Of the nine state funds, only one, Oregon's, is not financed through a government surcharge on oil, either a per-barrel tax or licensing requirement to import containers of oil. Instead of focusing on the oil itself, Oregon levies a per trip fee against all cargo ships passing through its waters, including non-self-propelled vessels. The other states impose per barrel or per gallon charges against the owner of the oil, whether importer or producer. These taxes range from $.007 per gallon in New Hampshire, to $.75 per barrel in Maryland. Other sources of funding include fines, recovery exceeding natural resource damages, interest on invested fund assets, private donations, sums recovered from the spiller, federal and state government appropriations and related sources.

Most states have created a single fund with the purpose of compensating for removal costs and damages. However, a number of states have established two independent funds - one for oil spill prevention, the other for response and clean-up. In Oregon, the prevention fund pays for training, maintenance of contingency planning and verifying the financial security requirements of the oil spill statute only, while the response fund goes to containment, clean-up and compensation for damages. Alaska passed legislation creating two funds with responsibilities almost identical to those in Oregon. Both states passed broad hazardous waste liability schemes which encompassed far more than oil spills -- the prevention funds help pay for handling and disposal programs for all hazardous substances. They also fund investigation and evaluation of the threatened release of hazardous substances. California also established two funds, which apply specifically to oil spills. The prevention fund is expressly excluded from use in responding to an oil spill. Specific caps were set for all but three of the state funds. California sets the highest ceiling at $100 million, followed by Texas at $50 million, Florida at $30 million, Maine at $6 million, and both New Hampshire and Maryland at $5 million. New York, Oregon and Alaska placed no express ceiling on the response fund, although Oregon caps the prevention fund at approximately $150,000. However, all nine states require that sufficient levels of funding be available to meet their obligations in the event of a spill.

B. Disbursement

Generally, use of the funds for compensation is restricted to a specified list of activities. All
11
the funds disburse money for their own administration. All disburse money for immediate oil spill removal expenses. If there has been an actual spill, the response funds offer a secondary source of recovery, after the responsible party, for property damages to state and private parties, although the amount of recovery may be limited. And, generally, when the amount of damages exceeds the amount in the fund the recovery is prorated among valid claims and satisfaction of those claims is made as the fund is reconstituted. Additionally, the liability legislation unanimously requires some sort of financial security, and that a contingency plan be provided by the shipper of oil or hazardous substances to cover the possibility of discharge.

There are some differences in scope of coverage, however. The Maine fund includes coverage for the cost of arbitration and arbitrators. Florida provides a complex and comprehensive compensation schedule for the restoration of natural resource damages which is designed to address particular environmental factors, such as the type of habitat affected, the type of oil spilled, the use of the affected area, and other biological factors. New Hampshire divides its fund into oil spill clean-up and provision of fresh water supplies to its inhabitants.

        Liability for damages is strict and unlimited for responsible parties under the state acts. An area of confusion regarding the amount of liability imposed for an oil spill when both the limited liability of the OPA and the strict liability of a state act are invoked remains unresolved. Liability is also unlimited for clean-up and removal costs. The purpose of the state funds is to provide a source of money to pay for immediate response to an oil spill and then provide a secondary source for compensating victims of spills left uncompensated by responsible parties or other funds. They are the final safety net for compensation of oil spill damages and clean-up.

C. Reimbursement

Without exception among the states, reimbursement of the funds comes primarily from the responsible party. This, of course, is in addition to the other sources of financing statutorily available to each fund. It lies with the spiller to repay the state funds for any expenditures undertaken to fulfill the spiller's obligations under state law. These include investigating, monitoring and containing the spill, equipment and personnel costs, oil removal costs, property and natural resource damages, among others. The unlimited liability for these expenses in the state measures has caused a strong reaction among oil transporters. Some have threatened to cease delivery to the United States, or at least to those states with such high standards.

Responsible parties are not the only potential sources of reimbursement to these funds. Generally, the governor of each state is charged with the prompt reimbursement of funds from the federal government. Other than the usual defenses, (i.e., act of God, etc.), only the New York liability regime provides immunity from suit in specific instances to responsible parties.

                                                                                            12
D. Administration

There are two methods used by states for administering the funds.

About half of the funds established independent boards or committees to maintain their operation. The other half simply place a single administrator over the day-to-day operation of the fund's finances and leave disbursement and execution of contingency plans to state governors. This transfer of authority takes place during an emergency situation. 
It is sometimes difficult to ascertain who has the power to release of funds, particularly with the committee system. The committee may be required to receive input from or report to other, related organizations or agencies before taking action. Whether one government subsidiary may overrule the orders of another is an issue which may have disastrous consequences in the event of an emergency.

Financial administration is virtually identical in all of the state funds. The board or administrator must submit an annual budget and accounting to the appropriate committee in the state legislature.

Virtually anyone who suffers damages as a result of an unlawful discharge of oil may file a claim. First, the claims must be presented to the responsible parties. If there is no response, the claims against the funds may be filed with the fund administrator's office. Some states also require claims to be presented to the OSLTF before going to the state funds.

PART IV - Case Studies

In order to illustrate how the funds function, this memorandum will review several actual oil spills and the responses of the appropriate liability regime and fund. Unfortunately, since CRISTAL is a private funding mechanism, there is little public record of its operation. It will be omitted from discussion.

This section will discuss the massive Amoco Cadiz spill and the 1992 Haven case to show the CLC and Fund Convention in action. The Exxon Valdez spill will be used as an example of the pre-OPA system and the Morris J. Berman spill shows the OPA/OSLTF in comparison.

It will also include a discussion of the impact the OPA, in conjunction with the state liability mechanism, has had on the oil transport industry in the United States.

A. Amoco Cadiz and Haven

The Amoco Cadiz spill did not actually invoke the CLC or the Fund Convention. However, the response to the disaster shows why the international conventions were not applied and how the international community responded to the decision of the U.S. district court.
On March 16, 1978, the supertanker Amoco Cadiz ran aground off the French coast after its steering gear failed in a storm. The captain called for tugs to assist the floundering ship, but efforts to tow it to safety failed. It then struck the Portsall Shoal and oil began streaming into the water. All tolled, 60 million gallons (230,000 tons) of oil poured into the waters of Brittany, by far the largest single oil spill in history. The accident cost an estimated US$284 million, US$17 million going to clean-up costs and liability for damages reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, and devestated the local environment.

Amoco Cadiz' legal importance stems partly from the involvement of so many parties of different nationalities. These parties include an American oil company, a Bermudan insurer, the French government, a Liberian tanker, a Spanish shipbuilder, and a German tugboat company. This case was also the first in which a U.S. court gave treatment to the CLC and the Fund Convention.

Initially, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois held that, although the accident occurred in French waters, there was no significant difference between French and U.S. law in this area, therefore United States' law governed.

However, the court went on to give a thorough and much-criticized analysis of what would happen if the CLC applied. First, the court stated that the CLC was not intended to immunize from suit major oil companies which operate vessels, but only the crews and masters of those vessels. This was done by narrowly construing the phrase "servants or agents of the owner" in the immunity clause. Second, the court held that the consulting agreement between Standard Oil, the owner of the cargo, and Amoco Transport, the wholly-owned subsidiary which transported the oil, did not create an agent-principal relationship invoking immunity. Third, the court found that even if United States law were used to interpret the CLC, there was insufficient evidence to show an agency relationship existed in this case requiring immunity. What this meant for Standard Oil was the negligence of its wholly-owned subsidiaries which operated the Amoco Cadiz imposed unlimited liability upon Standard itself. Since no immunity was granted to Standard's subsidaries as "servants or agents" of the parent company, liability reached through to Standard. Therefore, instead of invoking the immunity provisions in the CLC, Standard Oil would face unlimited liability for all containment, removal and damages claims arising from the discharge due to its subsidaries negligence. Thus, the fund would not be liable for any of those expenditures.

This decision emphasizes the role of the Fund Convention as a secondary source of compensation after the party responsible for the spill itself. Theoretically, a claimant, if unsatisfied by Standard Oil, could have brought a claim under the Fund Convention. The Fund would then be subrogated to the claimant's cause of action against Standard Oil in order to receive reimbursement.

The 1984 Protocol to the Fund Convention was negotiated, quite by coincidence, in the weeks following the decision regarding Amoco Cadiz. The Protocol addressed the key problems of the Convention. First, it raised the limits of liability dramatically. But, second, it restricted the circumstances in which an owner would not be able to invoke the new limits. It did so by changing the "actual fault or privity" clause imposing unlimited liability to those instances in which "it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from [the owner's] personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and
14
with knowledge that such damage would probably result" (1984 CLC Protocol, Art. 6(2)). 
Third, they also expanded the categories of parties immune from suit under the CLC in order 
to "channel" liability to the rightful party.

In 1992, the Italian Court of First Instance ignored the Fund Convention's method for 
calculating the shipowner's upper limit of liability for oil spill claims. This decision arose 
from the Haven tanker spill which occurred off the coast of Genoa, Italy, in April, 1991. 
Instead of implementing the SDR unit of account in calculating the compensation amount, 
the presiding court determined that since neither the 1969 CLC nor the 1971 Fund 
Convention mentioned SDR as the unit of account, the court could not rewrite them to 
replace the Poincare franc with the SDR. In placing a value on the damage claims, the judge 
used the market price of gold to determine the final award rather than looking to the IMF's 
valuation of SDR.

The resulting total was seven times the amount calculated under the Fund's mechanism - 
US$88 million as opposed to US$648 million - and also seven times the limit on liability 
established by the Fund Convention and CLC for compensation. If the decision stands, it 
could serve to undermine the global standards of liability and the effectiveness of the Fund 
to meets its purpose. The method of valuation used by the Fund Convention would be 
entirely defeated.

For claims which are well within the limits of the CLC and the Fund Convention, the 
apparatus has worked to provide compensation to damaged parties. But the limits outlined 
in the CLC and the Fund Convention are inadequate and remain so since neither the 1984 
nor the 1992 Protocols have been ratified. If the 1992 Protocol is enacted, the limits will 
be raised to $270 million under both conventions.

B. Exxon Valdez

In the early spring of 1989, the pristine waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska, were 
polluted by approximately 11 million gallons of crude oil spilling from the Exxon Valdez. 
The response to the spill by the state and federal liability regimes proved woefully inadequate 
to meet the task.

As discussed above, there were four separate funds created to deal with oil pollution in four 
different geographic areas. In this case, only the CWA and the TAPAA funds were 
involved. Under the CWA, the liability limit was only US$250,000 for the responsible 
party, with an additional US$35 million available from its compensation fund, which 
contained only US$6 million at the time of the spill. The liability under TAPAA was limited 
to US$14 million, with additional compensation from TAP fund topping out at US$100 
million. If unlimited liability due to "willful negligence or willful misconduct" were not 
imposed upon Exxon, the bulk of the clean-up costs and damages, totaling over US$2 billion, 
would go uncompensated.

The established compensation system had not foreseen the enormous costs associated with 
such a massive spill. While the vast majority of oil spills are not on the scale of the Valdez, 
the funding mechanisms in U.S. federal law were disastrously underfunded in this worst-case
15
scenario. Fortunately, the funds were never called upon to compensate for this spill, because 
of Exxon's negligence and its capacity to bear the related costs.

C. Morris J. Berman

The Morris J. Berman, an oil barge being towed near the entrance of San Juan Harbor, 
Puerto Rico, broke free and struck a coral reef on January 7, 1994. One million gallons of 
oil spilled into the Atlantic Ocean. The barge owner carried a US$10 million insurance 
policy, consistent with the standards established in the OPA for a barge its size.

However, within one week clean-up costs had exceeded US$10 million and the Coast Guard 
officially assumed financial responsibility for the operation. Within the week, Congress 
approved a US$20 million appropriation from the US$1 billion OSLTF towards removal 
costs. By November, 1994, these costs had exceeded US$86 million and the OSLTF had 
paid US$81.7 million of that total.

Congress appropriated an additional US$40 million to satisfy the more than 200 third-party 
claims for damages filed with the NPFC after investigative hearings disclosed the negligent 
operation of the barge and tug boat prior to the spill. The OSLTF is now subrogated to any 
claims they have satisfied against the barge owner or their guarantor exceeding the US$10 
million security paid by the barge owner's insurance company. If negligence had not been 
attributed to the operators, the OSLTF would recover those funds through the $.05 per barrel 
tax used to finance its operation.

If a state government had incurred expenses, it could then proceed against either the 
responsible party or the OSLTF. Private parties may also bring claims against the 
responsible party or the OSLTF. In addition, they may have the option of filing a claim with 
a state compensation fund.

The response of the oil industry to the increased liability under the OPA and the strict 
liability under state laws has been swift. First, Shell Oil immediately withdrew its entire fleet 
from U.S. waters and now uses only chartered vessels to transport oil. Several other oil 
transporters follow the same practice. Others have refused to carry the heavy crude oils 
which are difficult and costly to clean-up. Second, corporate restructuring to create "space" 
between oil companies and their subsidiaries in order to avoid liability has been more 
common. Third, owing to the increased liability of guarantors to direct actions, the cost of 
obtaining insurance has risen rapidly, making it difficult for smaller shippers to meet the 
security requirements of the OPA.

PART V - Analysis for Antarctic Fund

A. Collection

This may be the most difficult aspect of an Antarctic Pollution Compensation Fund: How 
to collect contributions to pay for damages, preventative measures and clean-up and enforce 
16
payment of amounts in arrears. The oil pollution response funds are generally funded through a per barrel surcharge plus reimbursement costs from individual parties. This method of collection presents a problem for Antarctica. In most instances, oil companies and States are willing to pay this extra fee because of the enormous profits associated with the trade. The volume of oil imports into Antarctica, on the other hand, is negligible and so would the amount collected through an oil surcharge. Additionally, there is no "market force" providing incentive to pay such a fee.

Viable alternatives to this approach do exist. First, a per capita "entrance fee" may be charged for visiting scientists or tourists. Fees may be scheduled according to the purpose of the visit. Second, following the method used by the state of Oregon, a trip fee may be charged per ship. Again, the purpose of the trip would establish the amount assessed. For semi-permanent or permanent scientific outposts a site fee may be imposed for both the initial entry and then an annual maintenance fee. Creating licensing or permit requirements is another ready source of revenue to finance the fund.

The ability to create and manage this fund depends heavily on two issues: 1) How many visitors arrive in Antarctica for scientific research or tourism purposes per year, and 2) how to enforce contributions? Furthermore, a balance must be drawn between protecting the Antarctic environment and encouraging study of that environment. The burden borne by the scientists and visitors in Antarctica must not be so great as to deter the region's scientific exploration. While the complaints of the oil industry regarding the potential liability of the OPA and state legislation may be overstated, their refusal to enter U.S. waters is a lesson to be learned.

B. Structure and Administration

An initial decision regarding the structure of the fund must be made. The pre-OPA system demonstrates clearly that dividing the available funding nullifies the effectiveness of a compensation regime. However, the creation of two funds - one for prevention and the other for spill response - is an alternative to be considered. A single fund may be easier to administer, but expenditures are made for two distinct purposes.

The next key aspect to address is the line of decision-making authority. One of the major problems with the Exxon Valdez clean-up effort was the confusion regarding who was in charge. There must be a clear line of authority to ensure prompt, efficient and sufficient response to any level of contamination. The U.S. models lean toward a committee or board structure with a single independent executive possessing emergency powers. This single executive then acts for the board or the fund to disburse and obtain reimbursement for expenditures, recovery for damages and enforcement of contributions.

Another important issue to decide is the establishment of an accounting mechanism. Clear accounting enables the fund to make good the debts owed to it for its expenditures. It also prevents abuse of the funds' assets.
C. Definitions and Language

Several key components must be written in unambiguous language to prevent confusion when making a claim.

First, the claim valuation method must be clearly delineated to ensure prompt, accurate and fair recovery for expenditures and damages. The Haven case is a good example of the potential harm which may be brought by different interpretations in this area.

Second, the defenses available to the parties must be plainly expressed.  All State Parties must know that sovereign immunity does not exist under this liability regime to prevent expensive, time-consuming litigation or arbitration in the future.

Third, the liable parties must be easily ascertained. As the Amoco Cadiz showed, different interpretations of relationships can impose millions of dollars of liability on different parties. Agency principles may need to be included in this section. That case also reflected the international character of the potential parties.

Fourth, conditions required for payment from the fund should be carefully constructed to explain what is covered and when money from the fund may be procured. Must there be physical damage or will economic or scientific loss also be covered? Also, what parties may make the claim against the fund must be expressly shown. Will claims be limited to State Parties, or will individuals be able to file against the fund?

D. Disbursement

Disbursement of funds for preventative measures, damages or removal costs should be straightforward. However, it should also be made clear that the fund is a secondary source of compensation following the liability paid by the violating party. Primary responsibility must be laid at the responsible party's feet, and reliance on the fund to make up for any gap in coverage left by the violator should be discouraged. At the same time, the availability of the fund should be made simple and efficient. Similar to the individual state funds, one of the main purposes of the fund is to provide immediate funding for clean-up operations.

The amount of available funding should also be asserted clearly. Limits should be established, but only after consideration of a worst-case scenario in order to prevent potential underfunding. However, if preventative measures are enacted, then the level of damage should be mitigated.

Also, what activities or expenses will be eligible for compensation should be established. What level of compensation will be available for damages? Preventative measures? Removal?

E. Reimbursement

As in collection, the key issue is enforcement.  Who has standing to bring a cause of action

18
for the fund must be stated. Which law governs and where a claim may be filed must also 
be established. It is important to maintain the fund as a viable source of protection for the 
Antarctic environment. Preparing clear procedural rules regarding repayment from this 
secondary source of compensation will help achieve this goal.

CONCLUSION

A close look at the existing compensation funds available for oil pollution damages and 
removal costs provides an excellent model to create a similar fund for the Antarctic Treaty 
Area.
