An Environmental Code of Conduct 
for the McMurdo Dry Valleys

New Zealand
(Agenda Item 6(a))

1. Introduction

The McMurdo Dry Valleys are a largely pristine area recognised for their unique 
ecosystems and high value as a natural scientific laboratory. Research interest from New 
Zealand and the United States has focused on the area for over three decades. More 
recently science interest from other nations has increased and tourists have become regular 
visitors.

Concern over the impacts of human activities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys has led to a 
number of proposals for improved environmental management in the area. Amongst these 
initiatives is an Environmental Code of Conduct covering field activities in the Valleys.

2. A McMurdo Dry Valleys Environmental Code of Conduct

The first version of an Environmental Code of Conduct for the McMurdo Dry Valleys was 
developed during an international workshop sponsored by the United States National 
Science Foundation held in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1995. The aim of the code was to 
provide practical guidance for the activities of scientists and support personnel in the field, 
directed at minimising detrimental environmental impacts.

Following on from the workshop, the New Zealand and United States Antarctic 
programmes agreed that there would be benefits in asking scientists and other personnel to 
trial the code during their visits in the Dry Valleys in 1996/97. The code was updated and 
modified to more fully reflect the current operating practices of the two countries. In many 
cases this meant strengthening the requirements of the code as it was agreed at the Santa Fe 
workshop.

During re-drafting, it became obvious that a shorter abbreviated version of the code was 
also required and indeed addressed one of the major concerns raised during the Santa Fe 
workshop ie the potential for impacts from poorly informed day visitors. Consequently, 
the New Zealand and United States programmes agreed to a one page environmental code 
of conduct which highlighted the precautions and actions necessary for people spending 
just a few hours in the Valleys.

3. New Zealand Field Trials During the 1996/97 Season

The Environmental Code of Conduct for the McMurdo Dry Valleys was trialed by New 
Zealand field parties during the 1996/97 field season. The Code was distributed to all field 
parties intending to overnight in area.

The shorter one page code was also distributed to day visitors to the Valleys. This group 
included distinguished visitors, support staff and helicopter pilots. The International 
Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) was provided with a copy for their 
information and use.
A copy of the Environmental Code of Conduct for Field Work in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the shortened version of the code developed for day visitors is attached. Feedback and comments by users of the codes has been encouraged. The code will be issued to New Zealand field parties again during 1997/98.

4. Use of the Code in other Ice Free Areas

New Zealand recognises the need to provide, at an individual level, more sophisticated and targeted educational material about the potential impacts of human activities on the Antarctic environment and ways to minimise those impacts. The Environmental Code of Conduct for the McMurdo Dry Valleys, trialed during the 1996/97 field season, is an example and could be incorporated into any management plans developed to cover the area in the future.

A similar code, modified as appropriate, could also be developed to cover other ice free areas in Antarctica where concerns have been raised over the human impacts on natural ecosystems. Possible locations include other ice free areas that are the focus for concentrated human activity. Parties are encouraged to consider the application of a similar Code of Conduct as an effective environmental education tool for scientists and other visitors to these important ice free areas.

 Environmental Code of Conduct for
Field Work in the McMurdo Dry Valleys

Why are the Dry Valleys considered so important by the scientific community? The Dry Valleys ecosystem contains geological and biological features that date back thousands to millions of years. Many of these ancient features could be easily and irreversibly damaged by inadvertent human actions. Unusual communities of microscopic life forms, low biodiversity, simple food webs with limited trophic competition, severe temperature stress, aridity and nutrient limitations are other characteristics which make the Dry Valleys unique. This ancient desert landscape and its biological communities have very little natural ability to recover from disturbance. Research in such systems must always aim to minimise impacts on land, water and ice to protect them for future generations. This code suggests how you can help to ensure this.

General Conditions:
•	Your visit to the valleys should have as little impact as possible. Everything taken into the valleys must be removed and returned to Scott Base. Do not dump any unwanted material on the ground.
•	Activities which would result in the dispersal of foreign materials should be avoided (e.g., do not use spray paint to mark rocks) or conducted inside a hut or tent (all cutting, sawing and unpacking).
        Solar and wind power should be used as much as possible to minimise fuel usage.
•	The location of any disturbance, spill, camp site, soil pit, or other sampling site should be mapped and recorded in your field report for eventual transfer to a management GIS. Where possible, the GPS coordinates of the site should be recorded.
•	Water used for ANY human purpose must be removed or treated in a grey water evaporator.
•	All human waste must be collected and removed.
•	Do not leave any travel equipment behind (e.g. ice screws, pitons). Avoid building cairns.
•	Ground vehicle usage should be restricted to snow and ice surfaces.
•	When travelling on foot, stay on established trails whenever possible. Avoid walking on vegetated areas and delicate rock formations.

Field camps: location and set up
•	Campsites should be located as far away as practicable from lake shores and stream beds to avoid damage or contamination. Do not camp in dry stream beds.
        Campsites should be re-used to the greatest extent possible. Before entering the Dry Valleys you should attempt to determine the location of previously used campsites in the area you are visiting.
•	Ensure that equipment and supplies are properly secured at all times to avoid dispersion by high winds. High velocity katabatic winds can arrive suddenly and with little warning.
•	Maximise the use of fixed helicopter pads. Use markers clearly visible from the air to mark pads.

Fuel and chemicals
•	Take steps to prevent the accidental release of chemicals such as laboratory reagents and isotopes (stable or radioactive). Chemicals of all kinds should be dispensed over drip trays or other containment. When permitted to use radio-isotopes, precisely follow all instructions provided.
•	Ensure spill kits are appropriate to the volume of fuel/chemicals and you are familiar with their use.
•	Use fuel cans with spouts when refuelling generators and only refuel generators and vehicles over trays with absorbent spill pads.
•	Never change vehicle oil except over a drip tray.
Sampling and experimental sites:
	• All sampling equipment should be clean before being brought into the Dry Valleys.
	• Do not displace or collect specimens of any kind, including fossils, except for scientific and educational purposes; in SSSIs or SPAs the sample size will be specified in your collecting permit.
	• Once you have drilled a sampling hole in lake ice or dug a soil pit, keep it clean and make sure all your sampling equipment is securely tethered.
	• Backfill soil pits to prevent wind erosion and dispersal of deeper sediments.
	• Avoid leaving markers (e.g. flags) and other equipment for more than one season without marking them clearly with your event number and duration of your project.

Lakes:
	• Clean all sampling equipment to avoid cross-contamination between lakes.
	• Retain any excess water or sediment for removal to your station.
	• Never use explosives on a lake.
	• Only use vehicles on lake ice when essential; park the vehicle on permanent ice rather than moat ice during the period of summer melt.
	• Ensure that you leave nothing frozen into lake ice which may ablate out and cause contamination.
	• Avoid swimming or diving in the lakes. These activities could contaminate the water body and physically disturb the water column, delicate microbial communities and sediments.

Streams:
	• Use designated stream crossing points whenever possible.
	• Avoid walking in the stream bed at any time; you may disturb the stream biota which represent several decades of slow growth.
	• Avoid walking too close to stream sides as this may affect bank stability and flow patterns.

Valley floor and sides:
	• Avoid disturbing mummified seals or penguins.
	• Avoid sliding down screes or sand dunes; these features have taken many thousands of years to form and may also contain surface deposits of major scientific importance.

High Desert:
	• Beware of causing damage to delicate rock formations. Some of the biological communities in them have taken several thousand years to develop.
	• Collect only the minimum sample of endolithic community required for scientific analysis.

Glaciers:
	• Minimise the use of liquid water (e.g., with hot water drills) which could contaminate the isotopic and chemical record within the glacier ice.
	• Avoid the use of chemical-based fluids on the ice.
	• If stakes or other markers are placed on a glacier, use the minimum number of stakes required to meet the needs of the research; where possible, label stakes with your event number and project duration.
