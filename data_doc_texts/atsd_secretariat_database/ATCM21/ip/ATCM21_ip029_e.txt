Opening Address by Ambassador Dr. Jochen Trebesch,
Head of the Delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany

Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the German delegation I would like, first of all, to congratulate you on your election to the chair of the XXIst Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Parties. At the same time I would like to express our deep appreciation to the Government of New Zealand for hosting this Consultative Meeting here in Christchurch and for its excellent preparations.

Germany notes with great satisfaction that since the XXth Consultative Meeting in Utrecht there have been further ratifications of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection. We invite the remaining States to follow suit so that the Protocol can enter into force as soon as possible.

The Madrid Protocol is of increasing importance for the development of the Antarctic Treaty System. We should use the interim period before it comes into effect to achieve as much progress as possible in meeting its practical requirements. One of these matters is the establishment of the Committee for Environmental Protection.

In other areas, too, we will have to think in terms of the challenges ahead. Germany is committed to undertake all efforts to improve the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty System where necessary and desirable.

A crucial task in fostering effective environmental protection is to elaborate a liability regime regarding environmental damage in the Antarctic. Several meetings of legal experts from the Consultative Parties have explored this complex issue. We hope that major steps can be made at this Consultative Meeting so that the draft of an Annex on Liability can soon be presented to the Consultative Parties for final discussion.

Another challenge is that of organisational improvements to ensure that we continue to perform our duties responsibly. This is especially true with respect to the establishment of a small and cost effective Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.

Mr. Chairman,

Convinced that New Zealand's thorough preparations and hospitality will facilitate our work and with full confidence in your leadership, the German delegation wishes to assure you its full support in your efforts to make our deliberations at this Consultative Meeting fruitful and successful.
