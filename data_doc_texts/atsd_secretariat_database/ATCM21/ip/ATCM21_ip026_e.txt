International Collaborations on Scientific Activities on King George
Island

(Agenda 12 : Submitted by Republic of Korea)

A. Cooperations with Chile and Peru

Taking into account the decision of the Antarctic Treaty Parties to
designate the 1991-2000 as the Decade of the Antarctic International
Scientific Cooperation, the Korea Ocean Research & Development
Institute (KORDI) and the Instituto Antartico Chileno (INACH) signed
in 1996 an Agreement on Scientific, Logistic and Technological
Cooperation in Antarctica. KORDI and INACH will jointly develop
and coordinate scientific, medical, technological, logistic and environmental
research projects for the purpose of protecting the Antarctic environment
and dependent and associated ecosystems.

Conscious of the importance of the scientific research and within the
spirit of the Antarctic Treaty for promoting and assuring cooperation in
the Antarctic, the Government of the Republic of Korea and the
Government of the Republic of Peru signed in 1996 an Agreement on
Scientific, Technologic, and Logistic Cooperation in Antarctica. The
executive committees of this Agreement are the KORDI for the Republic
of Korea and the National Commission of Antarctic Affairs (CONAAN)
for the Republic of Peru.

As a first step to set out these collaborations, several scientists from
Chile and Peru will be invited to an International Antarctic Symposium
which will be held in Korea this August (details in the following section).

*   Chile and Peru along with Brazil and Uruguay had provided us
aircraft services from Punta Arenas to King George Island during
the 1996/1997 when the Korean Antarctic Summer Research Party
had difficulti[?]s in transporting scientists and cargo due to
problems in the operation of the chartered vessel. We highly
appreciate the efforts exerted by these countries.

B. International Antarctic Symposium

The polar Research Center of the KORDI holds the Fifth International 
Symposium on Antarctic Science on 19-21 August in 1997, KORDI, 
Ansan, Korea.  The Symposium has been held every two years in Korea 
since 1988.  Ten to fifteen scientists from several countries will be 
invited to the symposium and present papers on Polar Biology: Ecological 
Processes related to Environmental Changes.
