OPENING SPEECH BY AMBASSADOR CARLOS A. ZALDIVAR
HEAD OF THE SPANISH DELEGATION

Mr. Chairman,

I would like, first of all, to congratulate you for your election as Chairman of this XXI 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. I also wish to express my gratitude to the Government 
of New Zealand and the Christchurch authorities for welcoming us in this pleasant city.

Also, we should all congratulate ourselves for the progress made since our last meeting 
in the ratification of the Madrid Protocol. We may say that one of the Antarctic international 
cooperation stages is about to conclude and that this meeting takes up the responsibility of 
preparing the international community to start a new cooperation stage, both more intense and 
committed.

In this vein, three tasks stand out. These are the establishment of the Committee on 
Environmental Protection as set forth in the Madrid Protocol, the establishment of the Secretariat 
and the completion of the Annex on Liability.

We have been working earnestly on these issues in previous meetings. The specific task 
ahead of us in this meeting is to make sure these tasks are finalized, that is, that we reach our 
final conclusions.

It would be highly desirable for the Secretariat to be established as soon as the Madrid 
Protocol has come into force and, to do so, there is only one possibility: to consummate the 
almost unanimous consensus which is for Buenos Aires to become the headquarters.

Regarding the establishment of the Environmental Protection Committee, the 
circumstances are calling for its rules of procedure to be finalized. The same holds true for the 
Annex on Liability.

There certainly are a number of other issues we should address and where progress can 
be made. But every moment in history is fashioned around its own meaning, and in the history 
of the Antarctic the purpose of this XXI ATCM is to make sure the Madrid Protocol takes off 
as soon as it has been fully ratified.

Mr. Chairman, the Spanish delegation trusts that under your guidance we will accomplish 
these goals, and we hereby offer you our full cooperation.
