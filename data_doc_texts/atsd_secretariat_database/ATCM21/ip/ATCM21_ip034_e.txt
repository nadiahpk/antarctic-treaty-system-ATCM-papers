                  Information Paper submitted by SCAR to XXI ATCM

                                  Agenda Item 12

The draft Final Report of XX ATCM contained the following sentence at the end of the first 
paragraph in section (106) under Item 13. Antarctic Science: Major New Initiatives.

"SCAR also stated its willingness to report to the next ATCM on biological 
diversity, in particular marine biodiversity."

Biological diversity is the variety of all forms of life: the different plants, animals and micro-
organisms, the genes they contain, and the ecosystems of which they form a part. Biological 
diversity is not static, but constantly changing; it is increased by genetic change and 
evolutionary processes and reduced by processes such as habitat degradation, population 
decline and extinction. The concept recognises the inter-relatedness of the biological world. It 
covers all terrestrial, marine and other aquatic environments.

Biological diversity can be considered at three levels.
  • Genetic diversity: the variety of genetic information contained in individual plants, 
    animals and micro-organisms that inhabit the earth. Genetic diversity occurs within and 
    between populations of organisms that comprise individual species as well as among 
    species.
  • Species diversity: the variety of species on Earth.
  • Ecosystem diversity: the variety of habitats, biotic communities and ecological 
    processes.

The recently concluded international Convention on Biological Diversity is global in scope, 
covers the full range of biological diversity, and has as its primary aim the conservation of 
biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of 
the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. Many of these elements are already 
implicit or explicit in Treaty instruments although their implications have not been recently 
assessed in terms of the current uses of the Antarctic.

The Convention on Biological Diversity emphasises in situ conservation measures, with ex-situ 
conservation complementing these, and contains measures on the identification and monitoring 
of important components of biological diversity, establishment and management of protected 
areas, sustainable management of biological resources both within and beyond protected areas, 
rehabilitation and restoration of degraded ecosystems, recovery of threatened species, control 
of pest species, control of threatening processes and activities, involvement of local 
communities, sustainable use of biological resources, and research and training. The Protocol 
to the Antarctic Treaty for the Protection of the Environment specifically addresses many of 
these issues including protected areas and control of alien species, whilst CCAMLR addresses 
the sustainable management of marine biological resources.

The assessment of Antarctic biodiversity in marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, the 
characterization of their unique biota, and an understanding of the functional role of 
biodiversity in the Antarctic and related ecosystems have always been recognized by SCAR as 
research priorities and as basic requirements for much biological research and the conservation 
of species, communities and habitats.

SCAR programmes and symposia have provided basic knowledge of Antarctic biodiversity and 
a wealth of data on the different levels of biological organization, from genes to species and 
communities in a wide range of Antarctic environments. However, some groups of organisms 
are still poorly known or require major taxonomic revision. Also, significant gaps exist in our 
understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes within different Antarctic subsystems and 
on latitudinal gradients.

BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN THE ANTARCTIC

There is at present considerable research under way which is relevant to the theme of 
biodiversity. This includes the preparation of manuals for the taxonomic identification of key 
groups (both on land and in the sea), the use of molecular tools to determine population 
variability and evolution, the mapping of organism distribution to determine areas of richness 
and the description of community and habitat to provide the basis for protection and 
management. Many of these fields were considered in part at the last SCAR Biology 
Symposium in Venice during 1994. It is likely that they will form a significant section of the 
next SCAR Biology Symposium in 1998 in Christchurch.

Through the new Subcommittee on Evolutionary Biology of Antarctic Organisms of the 
Working Group on Biology and under its different research programmes, in particular EASIZ, 
BIOTAS and APIS, SCAR is undertaking new actions that are relevant to the requests of the 
Global Biodiversity Assessment and to Agenda 21.
