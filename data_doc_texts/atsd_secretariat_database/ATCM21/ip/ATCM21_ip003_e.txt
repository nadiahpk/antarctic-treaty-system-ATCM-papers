Guidelines for Environmental Review - Experiences From 
the U.S. Antarctic Program

In the United States, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 
mandates review of all proposed government actions that could affect the 
environment. The national Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, 
which is responsible for the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) has established 
procedures for environmental review that of proposed activities in Antarctica 
which are based on NEPA, meet the requirements of the Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and are tailored to the 
unique environment of Antarctica. These procedures and the experience of 
the USAP in applying them may provide useful insights to other Antarctic 
Treaty Parties regarding practical approaches for incorporating environmental 
review into decision making from planning through to implementation.

Environmental Review in the United States
The NEPA Process

In the United States, NEPA provides a broad mandate for Federal agencies to 
consider environmental values in their decision making processes by 
assessing the environmental impacts of their proposed actions and 
reasonable alternatives to those actions. NEPA applies to agencies of the 
Federal government, not private citizens. In the twenty seven years since 
NEPA went into effect in 1970, the process for environmental impact 
assessment (EIA) has become an integral part of the decision making process 
across the full range of Federal programs.

A feature of NEPA, like that of the Environmental Protocol, is that it is 
procedural in terms of its obligations. That is, neither NEPA nor the Protocol 
impose any obligations with regard to the outcome of the decision making 
process. For example, neither requires that the environmentally preferred 
alternative be selected, although it must be examined and documented. 
Rather, NEPA obligates Federal agencies to follow a process of examining the 
impacts of proposed actions and alternatives, to document the findings, and 
to carry out proscribed public information and coordination activities. 
Underlying this approach is the belief that incorporating environmental 
analysis into governmental decision making will lead to better informed 
decisions.

The first step of the NEPA process is a brief examination, called an 
environmental assessment (EA), of the possible impacts of a proposed action 
and alternatives. If the assessment concludes that the proposed action is
1
04/04/97   17:23   202 647 1106   ES-0         003
APR-04-1997  14:55   NOR/UTT   202 647 1106   703 306 0139   P.03/11

unlikely to have significant environmental impacts, a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (a formal document in the NEPA process) is issued and 
the action may proceed without further environmental review. If the EA 
concludes that there could be significant environmental impacts, an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must be prepared. An EIS is a 
detailed examination of the possible impacts of a proposed action and 
alternatives. When preparing an EIS, the agency begins with a process 
called "scoping" whereby other agencies, the public, and potentially affected 
industry and other organizations are made aware that an EIS is being 
prepared and are asked to identify information and concerns that should be 
considered and addressed in the EIS. Following scoping, a draft EIS is 
prepared and made available for comment.1

Important Features of the NEPA Process

 
Since the passage of NEPA, many refinements and details have developed. 
Among the more important features are programmatic EISs. These 
documents cover broad Federal actions such as implementation of the USAP 
program. This allows a broad range of environmental issues to be addressed 
in one document rather than being repeated many times for parts of the 
program being considered. This in turn allows specific actions -- such as 
operation of a temporary summer field camp -- which may not have been 
explicitly considered in the programmatic EIS, to be considered in the context 
of the programmatic document. Thus, when preparing the EA for a 
particular action, the description of the environment and other relevant 
information and analyses in the programmatic EIS can simply be included by 
reference in the EA. Under NEPA, this is referred to as "tiering".
 
Another refinement is a process called "categorical exclusion" which allows 
agencies, subject to public notice and comment, to identify classes of activity 
which can be excluded from further environmental review. These are 
activities which, through prior environmental reviews, have been determined 
to not have a significant impact on the environment individually or 
cumulatively. The USAP has identified five classes of activities that fit this 
designation. They include:

 
  - Interior remodeling and renovation of existing facilities;
  - Low volume collection of biological or geologic specimens, provided no 
    more mammals or birds are taken than can be normally replaced by

The EA is like an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) under the Protocol on Environmental Protection 
to the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol). An EIS provides the same level of review and documentation as a 
Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) under the Protocol.

natural reproduction in the following season (note that this does not 
preclude the requirement for a permit for taking of birds or mammals);
      - Small-scale detonation of explosives in connection with seismic research 
conducted in the continental interior of Antarctica where there will be 
no potential for impact on native flora or fauna;
      - Use of weather/research balloons, research rockets, and automatic 
weather stations that are to be retrieved; and
      - Use of small amounts of radioisotopes for particular research projects 
provided such use complies with applicable laws and regulations, and 
with National Science Foundation procedures for handling and 
disposing of radioisotopes.

Threshold for Type of Documentation

To determine the appropriate documentation of possible environmental 
impacts, under NEPA the decision maker must judge whether the proposed 
action is likely to have significant impact. "Significant" is considered in terms 
of context and intensity. Both must be analyzed from several perspectives such 
as regional and local conditions. Both may vary, for example, with the setting 
of the proposed action. One site may be more sensitive than another. The 
same action may have significant impacts in one location and insignificant 
impacts in another.

Intensity refers to the severity of an impact. In evaluating intensity, the 
analysis should consider both impacts that may be beneficial, that is, a 
proposed action that will actually improve an existing condition, as well as 
impacts that may be adverse. Evaluation of intensity should address a number 
of considerations including:
      - unique characteristics of the geographic area;
      - the degree to which the effects are uncertain or involve unique or 
unknown risks;
      - the degree to which the action may set a precedent for future actions;
      - whether the action is related to other actions that cumulatively could 
have significant impacts;
      - the degree to which the action may adversely affect endangered or 
threatened species;
      - whether the action threatens a violation of any law or other 
requirement intended to protect the environment.

Environmental Review for the U.S. Antarctic Program

In considering any new activities, whether for science, science support, or 
operations, a preliminary review is performed to determine whether the 
proposed action has potential to affect the environment. Two forms have been
 
3
04/04/97   17:24   202 647 1106   ES-0                  005
APR-04-1997   14:56   202 647 1106   703 306 0139   P.05/11

developed to assist this effort. The first is a questionnaire that must be filled 
out when a scientist applies for funding of a research proposal (Attachment 1). 
It asks questions that will allow an initial determination of whether the 
proposed research might have associated environmental impacts. The second 
form is used by USAP personnel and support contractors in planning and 
implementation of all projects, whether science, science support or operational, 
to determine whether additional documentation is needed (Attachment 2). The 
form is used during the initial review of a project (initial decision) and 
during the project implementation review when the Support Information 
Package (SIP) is reviewed which provides the detailed analysis of the resources 
and requirements needed to support a project in the field. The form can also be 
used for assessing the adequacy of existing documentation for a project in 
which the project scope has been revised (revised scope) as well as for 
documenting in the field changes.

• The determination in a preliminary review that a proposed action may have 
environmental implications triggers a process to determine the appropriate 
type of documentation needed. Figure 1.a illustrates this process in a flow 
chart. Figure 1.b provides additional details. First, the proposed action must 
be defined in some detail. At the same time, the purpose and need must be 
clearly stated, i.e., when, where, how, why, and by whom will it be done. The 
next step is to determine if the action falls in one of the exclusion categories 
noted earlier. If the answer is yes, the possible environmental impacts are 
documented and the activity may proceed. If the answer is no, the next step is 
to determine if an assessment of the same or a very similar activity has been 
done previously. If so, the existing document is reviewed for relevance to the 
proposed action. If they are essentially the same, that is noted and the activity 
may proceed.

• This is the point in the environmental review process when tiering or 
programmatic environmental impact assessment documents can be very 
helpful. A programmatic EIS/CEE covering implementation of a major 
program such as a multi-national drilling project or even broader efforts such 
as the construction and operation of a new research station could serve as an 
umbrella document for other activities associated with that program or 
station. An EA/IEE can also serve the same purpose. For example, a 
programmatic document that assesses the impact of establishing in the polar 
plateau a generic field camp ranging in size from 4 to 40 persons would meet 
the environmental review requirements for any such activities in the future 
provided the particular activity is within the bounds of the potential activities 
assessed. Likewise, an assessment of a planned program of facility 
modifications including demolition and new construction could serve as an 
"umbrella" assessment from which the assessment of individual building 
construction activities could be tiered, as appropriate.

If no environmental documentation exists which appropriately addresses the 
proposed activity, then an EA/IEE2 is needed. A general outline used by the 
USAP in preparing these documents is included as Attachment 3. Among 
alternatives to be considered are the "no action" alternative (not doing the 
activity at all), and doing the action in a different way that addresses one or 
more issues while still fulfilling the purpose and need. It is in this process that 
mitigating measures are often identified that will reduce or limit the impacts of 
the proposed action. Mitigating measures are specific actions or procedures to 
be put in place to reduce potential environmental impacts. Examples of 
mitigating measures might include providing spill containment around 
drums in a fuel cache or requiring adherence to a code of conduct which 
restricts certain activities in an area.

The completion of the EA/IEE leads to one of two conclusions. The analysis 
may show that the alternative selected is likely to have no significant impact, 
in which case a finding of no significant impact is prepared. The alternative 
selected may be different from the initial proposed action such as when an 
alternative is assessed that includes mitigating measures to lessen or 
eliminate the impact of the activity.

Alternately, the analysis may show that the proposed activity and all 
reasonable alternatives may have a significant environmental impact. 
Significance, as noted earlier, is determined based on consideration of context 
and intensity. Here the NEPA criteria discussed earlier provide very useful 
guidance and are the criteria used by the USAP in determining the threshold 
for the level of analysis and documentation necessary for a proposed action. 
Should the analysis indicate that the potential for significant impact exists, an 
EIS/CEE would be initiated.

2The USAP currently uses both the nomenclature of NEPA and of the Protocol for its environmental 
assessment documents. For all practical purposes, the two have been equated, that is, an EA is the 
equivalent of an IEE and an EIS the equivalent of a CEE.

DETERMINATION OF 
APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION

1. Define the Proposed Action
   - Proposed action: What is to be done?
   - Its purpose:   Why is it to be done?
                   When, where, how, and by whom will it be done?

2. Is It Categorically Excluded?
   - Can the action fit into a category of exclusion?
     - If it can fit, then proceed to step 2c.
     - If no, go to step 3 to determine if an EA/IEE has been done 
         previously for a comparable activity

3. Checking For Similar Environmental Documents
   - Is there a similar action with similar circumstances described in another 
     EA/IEE?
     - If yes, then based on that EA/IEE, prepare a Finding of No 
         Significant Impact, have it signed by the appropriate authority and 
         implement the activity.
     - If no, prepare an EA/IEE. Go to step 4.

4. Preparing a New EA/IEE
   - Does the EA/IEE indicate the environmental impacts may be significant or 
     insignificant?
     - If the effects are determined to be insignificant, prepare a Finding of 
         No Significant Impact, have it signed by the appropriate authority, 
         and implement the activity.
     - If the effects may be significant, begin preparation of an EIS/CEE.
