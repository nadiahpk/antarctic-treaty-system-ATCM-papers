OPENING ADDRESS BY MR ALIOCHA NEDELTCHEV,
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF
BULGARIA

Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the Bulgarian delegation I would like to congratulate
you on your election as Chairman of the XXIst Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank the
Government of New Zealand for hosting this Meeting and to express to the
people of Christchurch our appreciation for their kind hospitality.

Mr. Chairman,

Since the Bulgarian delegation has already had the possibility to
present to the Plenary its request for Consultative Status under the
Antarctic Treaty, I would like to confine this intervention to other issues of
common interest.

First of all my Government attaches great importance to the need to
enhance the protection of the Antarctic environment. We note with
appreciation that only two more ratifications are necessary to bring the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty into force.
Bulgaria has already stated its firm intention to submit this Protocol for
ratification in order to accede to it as soon as possible. This intention is
formally endorsed by the Decision of the Council of Ministers (390/9
April 1997).

We are pleased to note that more than 35 years the Antarctic Treaty
is ensuring that Antarctica has been used exclusively for peaceful
purposes to the benefit of all mankind. In our view this success was
possible because of the spirit of co-operation among the Antarctic Treaty
Parties. This delegation believes that the imminent entry into force of the
Protocol will increase the scope of co-operation and, thus, the demand for
establishment of a cost-effective Secretariat.

Another important issue on our agenda is the elaboration of an
Annex to the Madrid Protocol on liability. My delegation hopes that,
despite the complexity of the topic, fruitful deliberations should lead to a
successful conclusion of the draft.

The Bulgarian delegation welcomes the decision to hold a Heads of 
Delegation meeting to address vital issues of the future operation of the 
Antarctic Treaty System. We believe that delegations will find the 
appropriate ways and means to increase significantly the effectiveness of 
the ATCM.

In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I would like to reiterate my 
delegation's commitment to the spirit of co-operation which, without any 
doubt, will ensure the success of the present Meeting.

Thank you.
