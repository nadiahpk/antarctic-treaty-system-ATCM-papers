OPENING ADDRESS
OF THE HEAD OF THE BRAZILIAN DELEGATION
TO THE XXI ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING

On behalf of the Brazilian Delegation, I wish to express our gratitude to the
Government of New Zealand for its warm and generous hospitality. We are also deeply
grateful for the invaluable support provided for all delegations and the impeccable
preparation of the Meeting, which this year takes place in such a pleasurable city as
Christchurch.

The Brazilian Delegation is convinced that the XXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting will foster important results, which, in their turn, will positively have a significant
effect on furthering the consolidation of the Antarctic Treaty System. Moreover, my
Delegation believes that the present meeting will reflect, as always, the spirit of harmony and
co-operation that has always guided the search for solutions within the Antarctic Treaty
System.

In this regard, we recognize the efforts brought about by the Group of Experts on
Liability for Damage to the Antarctic Environment, whose accomplishments will be reflected
in Annex VI of the Madrid Protocol. The outcome of its task will certainly satisfy the
expectations of the Parties in matters related to the prevention of negative impacts to the
Antarctic environment as well as the adoption of safer and appropriate measures in its
reparation, whenever a damage may occur, without compromising the continuation of
scientific research of financially less favoured Parties.

The continuance of the working sessions of the Transitional Environment Working
Group (TEWG) will be of fundamental importance to this Meeting, since its deliberations
will significantly contribute to the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), which
will soon be established. The CEP will constitute an important element to be added to the
Antarctic Treaty System, bearing the same significant role as other important institutions
such as SCAR and CCAMLR.
Another issue of general interest in which our Delegation hopes that progress is achieved during this Meeting is the establishment of a Secretariat for the Antarctic Treaty.

It is important to point out that a Secretariat will expedite the operativeness of the Treaty in a general sense and facilitate the necessary discussions and exchange of information for the preparation of Consultative Meetings.

The Brazilian Government is conscious of the utmost importance of environmental protection in Antarctica as well as its associated ecosystems. Thus, numerous measures have been internally adopted to standardize procedures, to train and educate personnel in environmental matters, to better equip facilities and to promote the development of research projects related to environmental monitoring.

The creation of the ASMA of Admiralty Bay, adopted at the last Consultative Meeting in Utrecht, will give grounds for the adoption of mechanisms to foster the development of scientific research activities based in the principles of environmental protection of the area and its associated ecosystems. In this sense, consistent work, presently in progress, will define environmental monitoring parameters aimed at assessing sites of scientific and historic interest. My Delegation wishes to express its gratefulness to the other Parties with specific interest in the Admiralty Bay area for their confidence in the indication of Brazil as the coordinator of the implementation of the Management Plan. The activities therein, which will be carried out on a jointly coordinated basis, will fully satisfy their expectations.

Finally, Mr. President, may I express with great satisfaction, on behalf of the Government of Brazil and therefore on behalf of my Delegation, our full commitment to the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and the Madrid Protocol, and our full conviction of the responsibilities that we share with the other fellow members in the Antarctic community.
