Opening Address by Mr Vassilios Patronas, Special Legal Adviser of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affair, Head of Delegation of Greece

Mr Chairman,

On behalf of the Greek Delegation, I would like to congratulate you on your election 
as Chairman of the XXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. May I also, through 
you Mr Chairman, express my gratitude to the Government of New Zealand for 
hosting this meeting in the beautiful city of Christchurch and also my thanks for its 
warm hospitality.

Mr Chairman,

● The Agenda of the present meeting contains many interesting items, including matters 
related to the protection of the environment in the Antarctic region.

In this respect, my Delegation is pleased to note that the number of ratifications of the 
Environment Protocol has been increased. Article 13 of the said Protocol provides 
that the Parties should notify all other Parties of the measures they have taken to 
implement this Protocol by adopting, among others, relevant domestic legislation. 
Greece having ratified the Protocol, works for the adoption of such legislation.

As to the elaboration of the Liability Annex, my Delegation is very happy to see that 
the Group of Legal Experts on Liability chaired by Prof Dr R Wolfrum of Germany, 
has made considerable progress.

Liability is always a thorny question to deal with. However, despite the inevitable 
difficulties, we are confident that this exercise will be successfully concluded and this 
will constitute in our view, a significant step towards the progressive development of 
international law in this field.

● Another important item on the Agenda is that of the ATCM structure after the 
establishment of the Committee for Environmental Protection. My Delegation 
believes that the legal aspects of this question should be carefully examined and 
therefore the establishment of a new working group looking at legal issues would be 
of valuable assistance.

Finally Mr Chairman, I would like to inform this meeting that Greece, and especially 
the National Center for Marine Research in collaboration with other Greek 
institutions, has prepared a National Program for Antarctica for 1996-2000. The 
realization of this program is now in progress.
