France has advised that it will undertake an EIA in 1997. This concerns "Operation Pile-Pole Sud", a sporting/scientific project involving several people parachuting on to the South Pole. As a preliminary impact assessment has not yet been carried out for this proposal, French authorities advise that they are unable to confirm if the project will be authorised.

Environmental Impact Assessment
Circulation of Information
in accordance with Resolution 6 (1995)

Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEE) prepared by Norway in 1996.

The Norwegian Regulations relating to protection of the environment in Antarctica
requires that an initial environmental evaluation is prepared for all activities that do
not require the preparation of a CEE. The following list therefore contains only an
overview of IEEs prepared for activities that have been considered to have a "minor or
transitory" impact, as opposed to those with "less than a minor or transitory" impact,
in order to make the same distinction as is made in Article 8 of the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Article 2 in Annex I to the same
protocol.

1. The Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition 1996/97

Description of activity:
The purpose of the activity was to ensure a safe and appropriate framework for the
Norwegian research projects which were carried through in Antarctica in the 96/97
season. The activity includes transport (ocean/air/land) and operation of the research
station Troll and the field station Tor.

The research project leaders submitted separate IEEs for the individual projects. All
the projects were considered to have less than a minor or transitory impact on the
environment in Antarctica. The cumulative impacts of the research activities were
considered in the IEE for the Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition, and included
the following projects:

- EPICA traverse
- Productivity in the southern Weddell Sea during austral summer
- Distribution and food consumption of crabeater seals
- The Adelie penguins phyisology
- Factors regulating pupulation size of seabirds at Svarthumaren
- Geological Mapping and studies on tectonothermal evolution in western DML
- Geodetic Measuremant DML
- Mass balance and glacier dynamics in Jutulstraumen
- Circulation and dense water - Weddell Sea
- Monotoring the Ice velocity at Jutulstraumen using satellite images
- Timing of glacial events in Antarctica
- Changing Mass-balance of the Fichner Ice shelf due to Climate variations

                                                                 31 20 36298ε

Time frame and location of the activity
The Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition took place in the Weddell Sea, as well 
as on land in Dronning Maud Land, mainly in the areas of the research stations Troll 
and Tor, the Jutulstrum area and surrounding areas. The expedition took place in 
December 96 through February 97.

IEE
The Norwegian Polar Institute, who is responsible for the Norwegian Antarctic 
Research Expeditions, prepared an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) "Initial 
Environmental Evaluation - Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition 1996/97" 
according to the measures put forth in the Protocol and in the Norwegian Antarctic 
Regulations. The IEE was forwarded to the Ministry of Environment for final 
evaluation in order to prevent institutional biases in the decision. The IEE is available 
in English, and can be obtained from:

The Norwegian Polar Institute
P.O. Box 399
9001 Tromsø
Norway

Decision taken following consideration of IEE
The activity was considered to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the 
Antarctic environment. The Ministry of Environment granted the Norwegian Polar 
Institute permission to carry through the activity, although with conditions regarding 
waste management, fuel management and activity in protected areas.

2. Svalbard Polar Travel - tourist expedition to Antarctica

Description of activity
Svalbard Polar Travel sub-chartered Professor Multanovsky from Marine Expedition 
Inc. to carry through a tourist expedition in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Tourists 
were to see and experience the Antarctic nature, and to learn more about the history of 
Antarctica.

Time frame and location of the activity
The expedition took place in the Antarctic Peninsula area, visiting sites in the South 
Shetland Islands. The expedition took place during the two first weeks of December 
1996.

IEE
Svalbard Polar Travel submitted an advanced notice as requested. The IEE "Initial 
Environmental Evaluation: Antarctic and Southern Ocean Seabornc tourism of Marine 
Expedition Inc." prepared for Marine Expeditions by Poles Apart in May 1995 was 
accepted as IEE for the tourist expedition.

Decision taken following consideration of IEE

The activity was considered to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the 
Antarctic environment. The Norwegian Polar Institute granted Svalbard Polar Travel 
the permission to carry through the activity as planned, although with conditions 
regarding waste management, information to tourists, etc.

IEEs for activity considered to have less than a minor or transitory impact

In addition to the above, IEEs were prepared for the following activities, although the 
activities were considered to have less than a minor or transitory impact on the 
Antarctic environment:

| Season    | Type of exp.      | Location                      | Assumed impact          |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1996/97   | Climbing expedition| Sør Rondane, Dronning Maud Land| Less than minor or transitory |
| 1996/97   | Solu crossing of continent | Berkner Isl. to McMurdo      | Less than minor or transitory |

Construction of small station unit in the Nyrøysa area on Bouvetøya

Although not required to prepare EIAs for activity on Bouvetøya the Norwegian Polar 
Institute prepared an IEE for the construction of a small station unit which was 
constructed in connection with CEMP-activity on the island. The IEE was forwarded 
to the Ministry of Environment for final evaluation in order to prevent institutional 
biases in the decision. The activity was considered to have no more than a minor or 
transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. The Ministry of Environment granted 
the Norwegian Polar Institute permission to carry through the activity, although with 
conditions regarding waste management, fuel management and behavior in and around 
the seal and penguin colonies in the area.

Initial Environmental Evaluations Prepared by New Zealand in 1996

Antarctic Cruise Programme: Southern Heritage Expeditions Limited, Christchurch, 
New Zealand

Purpose of Activity:

2       The purpose of SHEL's cruises is to raise awareness of the unique natural 
history of Antarctica through visits to the historic huts and in observing the conservation 
issues confronting the Antarctic continent.

Description of Activity:

3       Three cruises are planned extending over the period 28 December 1996 to 10 
March 1997. Each cruise will carry a maximum of 72 persons - 38 passengers, seven 
expedition staff and 28 crew. Two cruises will be in the Ross Sea region and the third 
will visit King George V Land. Requests to visit the scientific stations at Scott Base, 
McMurdo Station, Dumont D'Urville, and Terra Nova Bay will be made to the relevant 
authorities. Visits will be made to the historic huts in the Ross Sea at Cape Adare, Cape 
Cape Royds, and Cape Evans. Penguin colonies at these sites and at Cape Bird and 
Cape Hallett will also be visited. An attempt to land at the Balleny Islands will be made 
if weather conditions permit. Landings will be made at Commonwealth Bay, Stillwell 
Island, Cape Denison, Port Martini, Possession Island, and Franklin Island. There may 
also be some "whale watching".

Type of EIA Undertaken:

4       An Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) was completed for this activity. The 
IEE was subsequently reviewed by an independent panel: the Environmental 
Assessment and Review Panel (EARP). The Panel considered that the potential impact 
of the proposed activity would have no more than a "minor or transitory" impact on the 
Antarctic environment. It agreed that the activity could proceed.

Location of the Activity:

5       Longitude 160 degrees East and longitude 180 degrees East and between 
latitudes 45 degrees South and 78 degrees South.

Organisation Responsible for the EIA:

6       Southern Heritage Expeditions Limited 
P O Box 20 219

0196501.01

Christchurch
NEW ZEALAND

Monitoring of Activities:

7       The Expedition Leader will keep a log of the dates, times and duration of each 
        landing. Any "whale watching" will be the subject of a separate log which will record 
        all such encounters and their duration. On all cruises a New Zealand national 
        representative will be on-board to assist with the visits to the historic huts and to 
        observe compliance with ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1 and Resolution XIX-3.

Briefing of Passengers

8       In addition to the briefing material which is supplied to all passengers prior to 
        departure, the expedition staff provide lectures and briefings during the cruise. These 
        briefings cover safety issues, procedures to be followed at landings and in the historic 
        huts as well as to emphasise the various regulations for Antarctic fauna and flora and the 
        obligations of the Environmental Protocol in general.

Decisions taken following consideration of EIA:

9       The operator agreed to apply the IAATO guidelines in respect of incinerating 
        plastics on-board. It was noted that these guidelines are stricter than those in the 
        Protocol and that the highest standard for waste management should be applied. More 
        specific detail was supplied by the operator on oil spill contingency plans. The operator 
        also agreed to provide a log on "whale watching" activity.

Activity              : Burning of approximately 40 tonnes of untreated
                       crate timber during the 1996/97 Austral summer.

Location              : SANAE III on the fimbul ice shelf 15 km from the
                       coast.

Description           : This IEE relates to the disposal of approximately 40
                       tonnes of untreated waste timber by way of open
                       burning on the ice shelf. The accumulation of timber
                       was as a result of the difficulty and dangers related
                       to the strapping, transport and transfer to the ship.

Decision              : 
                       The burning of untreated timber was allowed within
                       the requirements of Annexure III to the Protocol on
                       Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty:
                       Article 3 and will take account of Article 12 under the
                       following conditions:

                       • Only untreated timber material from crates may be
                         burned.

                       • Burning may only take place at the old SANAE III
                         base in the designated area where burning was
                         permitted in the past.

                       • Burning may only take place under supervision of
                         the Officer-in-Charge at E-base.

                       • Auditing of the burning activities must be included in
                         the existing auditing programme.

                       • The permission to burn timber crates applies to the
                         1996/97 construction phase only.

                       • Appropriate equipment must be in place to enable
                         the removal of timber waste in the future as no
                         burning will be permitted in the future.
