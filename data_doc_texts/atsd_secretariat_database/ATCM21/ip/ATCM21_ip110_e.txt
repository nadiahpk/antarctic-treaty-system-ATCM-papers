OPENING ADDRESS OF DR. A.E. MUTHUNAYAGAM, SECRETARY,
DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA AND
HEAD OF THE INDIAN DELEGATION

Mr. Chairman,

At the outset, I would like to express our deep appreciation to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Government of New Zealand for
hosting the XXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and for the warm
hospitality extended to all of us in this beautiful city of Christchurch, which
is a gateway to Antarctica for expeditions of several nations.

I take this opportunity to reiterate India's commitment to the
Antarctic Treaty as a Consultative Party and in assuring of our constructive
contribution to the furtherance of the cause of this unique Treaty.

1996 has been a historic year in several aspects with respect to the
Indian Antarctic Programme. The XVI Indian Antarctic Expedition was
launched. This has since returned after successful accomplishment of the
scientific, logistics and environmental tasks. Our continued endeavour to
use Antarctica as a uniquely positioned laboratory to address issues of
global, and national concern has prompted us to frame a clear cut science
strategy to be pursued by the nation in the coming decade. As a part of
this science portfolio,  we are embarking upon bilateral scientific
cooperation with several countries in various domains of polar sciences.
This will be in consonance with the international campaigns under the
aegis of SCAR.

I also take this opportunity to inform the ATCM delegates that we are
in the process of establishing an exclusive Polar Research Laboratory
called the Antarctic Study Centre at Goa. This Centre which is designed to
become a national database repository in Antarctic Research shall also
function as the nodal operating agency for all scientific, logistic and
environmental activities of India in Antarctica.

True to the spirits of the Antarctic Treaty, coupled with a genuine
concern to protect and uphold the pristine nature of mankind's last frontier
on earth, India an original votary to the Protocol on Protection to Antarctic
2

Environment has ratified the same in April, last year. We earnestly hope 
that the process of ratification of this Protocol by all countries will be 
completed shortly.  While the establishment of the Committee on 
Environmental Protection under the Protocol is a welcome move, however, 
a cautious approach has to be adopted in not restricting the essential 
scientific and logistic activities of any member nation. During the current 
session the 7th offering pertaining to Liability Annex is being discussed. 
We hope that the deliberations yield a commonly accepted Liability Annex 
which takes into account the practical realities and financial capabilities of 
the various Treaty Parties who are using Antarctica as a pedestal to 
conduct science for the benefit of humankind.

Soon after the ratification of the Protocol by India, we have created 
an Environmental Management Group for Antarctica which dispatched a 
special Environment Task Force (ETF) in the just concluded Sixteenth 
Antarctic Expedition. ETF has carried out commendable tasks in restoring 
the natural surroundings and environs around the Indian station, 'Maitri' in 
Antarctica.

In all these and other matters figuring in the Agenda, I assure our 
whole-hearted cooperation to arrive at positive decisions through 
consensus. We indeed look forward to a very fruitful outcome of this 
meeting under your chairmanship.

Thank you.
