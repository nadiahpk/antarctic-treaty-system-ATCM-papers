ANTARCTIC SPECIALLY MANAGED AREA OF ADMIRALTY BAY

The 1996 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (XX-ATCM) adopted the Management
Plan for the Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) of Admiralty Bay, King George Island
(South Shetland Island) - ATCM XX WP-15 -. The Parties agreed to comply with ASMA on a
voluntary basis, until such time as Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty becomes effective under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty. When this occurs, the
area covered by the Management Plan will be effectively considered an ASMA, after an evaluation of
the acquired experience and, if necessary, a review of the Management Plan.

According to the provisions of Art 2 of the Management Plan, consultations were established
among the Brazilian Antarctic Programme (PROANTAR) and the others Parties, that have active
scientific programs in the area (Ecuador, Peru, Poland and USA). The Parties suggested, among
other subjects, the establishment of a coordination system for the implementation of the Management
Plan. It was agreed that the coordination of the Plan would be executed in a system of turns among
interested Parties and the first coordinator country mandate would last for three years. Brazil
presented its candidacy and was accepted to be the first coordinator country. Thus, the Rear-
Admiral ANTONIO CARLOS DA CÂMARA BRANDÃO, was designated as the Brazilian
coordinator for the implementation of the Management Plan of the ASMA during the period of
January 1997 to January 2000. The Rear-Admiral can be reached at:

The Management Plan for the ASMA of Admiralty Bay provides for meetings of interested
Parties, which will take place together with future ATCM meetings. According to section XXI, the 
following subjects will be discussed:

a) suggestions for the implementation and functioning of the Management Plan; and

b) suggestions for the modernization of the Management Plan.

Parties interested in developing activities in the area should take notice of the active research 
programme on Admiralty Bay which is published in the Exchange Information, under Art. VII (5) of 
the Antarctic Treaty. The goal is to optimize the logistic support and the collection of material, to 
decrease costs of research and at the same time to cause less damage to the Antarctic environment 
by avoiding successive repetition of research.

In order to minimize the impact on the environment caused by tourist activities in the area, 
the Management Plan was presented to the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators 
(IAATO), for its circulation among the operators who intend to organize visits to the Admiralty Bay.

The planning of the management activities for the Area are the following:

- to improve the level of mutual assistance and cooperation among the parties operating in 
the area;

- to avoid or minimize the risk of mutual interference and cumulative impacts on the 
environment;

- to improve the understanding of mutual processes in the area, which in turn will protect the 
environment from impact;

- to safeguard long term scientific research in the area;

- to develop a contingent plan for the whole area, for hydrocarbon spill or any accident with 
significant impact on the environment;

- to identify the sites of scientific interest; and

- to identify the sites of historic interest.

The implementation of the Admiralty Bay is designed in a way to obtain enough information
which will serve as a base is for the planning and execution of all activities in the area, either
govemmental or non governemental. The principle that drives the implementation of the Admiralty
Bay is the protection of the Antarctic environment and associated ecosystems, the preservation of its
natural state, and its value as an area destined to scientific research which is essential to the
understanding of the global environment.

The Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) has already initiated a survey of the area
site, seeking to obtain parameters for the environmental monitoring. At the same time, samples of
water are being collected to verify hydrocarbon levels and the purity degree of the effluents of the
sewers.

In order to determine the actions referring to the environmental monitoring, the PROANTAR
will create two Assessment Groups, which will consist of a panel of knowledgeable researchers from
various research institutions.

The Assistance Group of PROANTAR (GA), which is connected to the National Council of
Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), includes five researchers and is responsible for
the projects appraisal according to scientific methods.

The Environmental Valuation Group (GAAm), which works under the supervision of the
Ministry of Environment, Hydric Resources and Legal Amazon (MMA), is composed of nine
researchers and is responsible for the environmental impact evaluation of all Brazilian activities in the
Antarctic.

It is expected that, with the voluntary acceptance of the action of the conductive plan, the
ASMA of the Admiralty Bay may represent a local experience for the future Management Plan
Handbook, accomplishing the objective that has motivated its creation.
