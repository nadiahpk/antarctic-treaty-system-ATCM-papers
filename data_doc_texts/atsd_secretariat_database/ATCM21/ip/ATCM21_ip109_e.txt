REPORT
on the ecological research program
within the time frame of co-operation between
Russian Antarctic Expedition and QUARK Expeditions

presented by Russia (RAE) and IAATO

According to Article 6 of The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty about co-operation during concerted activity in the Antarctica, efficient use of
possibilities of national operators, conducting of joint logistic, scientific and
environmental projects becomes more and more topical. On the one hand it is caused
by expansiveness of conducted works, from the other hand - by increasing impact
from the individual activities of different operators. Under unfavourable conditions of
continuing deficit of Russian state financial support of the Antarctic researches and
simultaneous politics directed towards development of works within the frame work
of Madrid Protocol, the RAE seeks for different possibilities of co-operation that
could help to carry out ecological projects. Modern means of conveyance used by
tourist operators for visiting inaccessible regions, long term planning and regular
repeating of the same routes fit to the purposes of environmental monitoring studies.
Given all mentioned above, an attempt to join efforts of the RAE and QUARK
Expeditions to conduct project on ecological study and monitoring in Antarctica was
made during First Full Tourist Circumnavigation cruise in Austral summer 1996/97.

Taking into account wide possibilities of circumnavigation including numerous
coastal visits and perspectives of repeating such works, sampling geographically
spread along the Antarctic coast and establishing of monitoring works were
suggested expedient. Since it was the first attempt of such co-operation, program-
maximum was worked out as follows:
Applied goal - to obtain the data for monitoring Antarctic ecosystems including both abiotic components and marine bird and mammal populations as objects affected by Antarctic coastal station activities and shipping including the following objectives.

• to obtain the data on local fauna and populations of marine birds in the vicinities of Antarctic stations
• to determine the most vulnerable marine bird populations in relation to human impact
• to obtain the data on behavioural reaction of marine birds as a result of tourist activities
• to evaluate species and parameters to be used in monitoring
• to obtain the data on types of human impacts for different regions
• to gather samples of water, ice, and biota to be used for chemical analysis of pollutant contents

Scientific goal - to determine pelagic distribution patterns of marine birds and mammals as related to environmental factors.

Ecological studies were carried out in Austral summer 1996-1997 during Antarctic circumnavigation cruise on board icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov. The cruise started on Falkland Islands in the end of November 1996, passed around Antarctic continent and finished on Falklands in the end of January 1997.

 Brief description of the results

• Ship based survey of sea birds and mammals en route Antarctic Circumnavigation was carried out. Numerous landing during cruise allowed to conduct a unique set of counts on the cross-transects sea-land, that made possible to find out local quantitative distribution patterns in coastal waters adjacent to the Antarctic stations. The duration of quantitative counts totalled 270 hours

Brief analyses of obtained data gave preliminary broad scale distribution patterns of seabird and mammal in maritime Antarctica as related to marine habits. Totally 20 marine habitats were determined: regarding depth and distance to the mainland -
shelf seas, open ocean and shelf break; regarding ice conditions: ice-free waters, 
bergy waters, light pack ice (less than 7/10 concentration); heavy pack ice (8-10/10), 
special emphases was paid to the so-called marginal ice zone including polynyas.

Totally 40 species of sea birds and mammals were recorded at sea during Antarctic 
Circumnavigation (see table). There is evident effect of sea ice presence upon seabird 
distribution (see figure 1). In ice filled waters number of species did not exceed 9 
being 8.1 on average, while in open pelagic waters in Antarctic zone it reaches 12 
being 10.3 on average. A group of pagophilous species that are common and 
abundant includes snow and Antarctic petrels, Adelie and emperor penguins. In open 
drifting ice, large leads and polynyas Antarctic fulmar, Wilson's storm-petrel and 
Cape pigeon appear. In ice free oceanic waters black-browed and light-mantled sooty 
albatrosses can be observed already nearby drifting ice-edge, and in the sector 
between 90 and 180 W mottled petrel adds. However, the highest species diversity 
was observed in coastal waters of Antarctic Peninsula - 16 species, what even 
exceeded the value recorded while passing Antarctic Convergence zone (14). 
Imperial shag, kelp gull and skuas become common in the coastal waters. About 3 
species of sea mammals were recorded in each section on average with no significant 
differences between ice free and ice filled waters found. Highest diversity was 
observed in two ice covered sections in shelf seas both crossed shelf break and in 
coastal waters of Antarctic Peninsula as well. Greatest numbers of Minke Whales 
were clearly confined to the shelf breaks, while Humpbacked Whales were abundant 
in highly productive coastal waters of the Peninsula. Most Orcas were sighted in 
polynyas next to the fast ice edge. The data obtained on seabirds and seals are more 
numerous and need in detailed treatment including statistical analysis. They are 
planned to be published later. Fast-ice edge zone is the only habitat clearly 
demonstrated increased occurrence and abundance of seabirds.

● While landing at Antarctic bases and other sites all bird and mammal species were 
recorded, quantitative counts or number estimating were conducted when time 
and conditions allowed, that provided local fauna characteristics. Totally 38 sites
were visited, including 18 bases and temporary camps, belonging to 10 countries.
When at the bases, the data about their activities and personnel were gathered as 
well as photographies of the territory and constructions were taken.

• Samples of tissues from 3 bird species at 7 sites were taken (only carcasses of dead 
birds were used). Water from fresh water bodies at 8 sites was sampled. All 
samples will be analysed for pollutant contents to evaluate modern anthropogenic 
chemical impact on Antarctic coastal ecosystems.

All data mentioned above can be used as a background information for monitoring of 
marine bird populations. Quantitative characteristic of marine bird population near 
Antarctic stations as well as data on contamination are useful for the EIA process and 
for management recommendations as well.

Summarized results, we consider the first experience of interaction of QUARK 
Expeditions and the RAE to be positive and perspective for further co-operation 
aimed to ecological studies and monitoring. It should emphasis however, that such 
works become valuable for monitoring even being repeatedly conducted.
Occurrence of seabirds and mammals in different sections enroute Antarctic Circumnavigation.

Pelagic 'communities' are characterized taking into account frequency of occurrence of the species (% of 10-minute intervals where the species was recorded). Dominating (D) species were recorded during more than half of such intervals, frequent (F) species during 25-50%; common (C) during 10-25%; scarce (S) species during 1-10%; rare (R) species were met only 1-2 times during 2 hours of observation period.
