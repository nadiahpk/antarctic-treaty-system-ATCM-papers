CONDITIONS OF THE ICE ON THE WEDDELL SEA
DURING THE 1996/1997 SUMMER SEASON

We were able to reach Belgrano Base by navigating through a very
compact ice field with overwhelmingly thick ice which in some areas
had a very heavy build-up.

No long lasting wide navigable waterway could be opened.

We were able to navigate very close to the ice shelf by taking
advantage of faults, cracks and small crevisses which were
temporarily (lasting a very short time) formed by the tides. From
glaceological monitoring flights we were able to observe evidence
of diatomeas on the ice shelf as well as on grazed icebergs.

Although we foresee an increase in the size of the ice which
accumulates around the Belgrano II area (taking an oval shape), it
would not be advisable to use those photographs for forecasting
purposes.  Nevertheless, and taking into account the above
mentioned observations, if weather conditions are favourable before
the next summer season, we can infer that the ice field will not be
as compacted which will allow the opening of the waterway right up
to the Halley Bay area.

From Halley Bay on up to the Belgrano II area, even under
favourable weather conditions, if the position of the grazed
icebergs does not change considerably, the conditions of the ice
are expected to be similar to the ones we faced during the present
navigation.
