SUMMARY:

Continuing with the monitoring programme which was implemented by the Antarctic Unit of 
the IN.FUE.TUR, during the 1996-97 season 11 vessels were registered leaving the port of 
Ushuaia to carry out Antarctic tourism. In their 94 trips, these vessels transported 6.410 
passengers. This represents a decrease of 10.5% in the number of trips, and of 23% in the 
number of passengers with regards to last season.

During this last season, an estimated 7.150 passengers worldwide visited Antarctica by sea, 
which would indicate a 23% decrease in the number of passengers in relation to the 95-96 
season. Furthermore it has been noted that 90% of world passenger flow to Antarctica passed 
through the port of Ushuaia at least once and that 75% of them started and ended their trips in 
Ushuaia.

In relation to visited sites, activities took place in 91 locations of the Antarctic area, whereas 
53% of those visits were concentrated in just 10 locations.

1.      INTRODUCTION

Since its creation in September 1992, the Antarctic Unit of the Instituto Fueguino de Turismo 
(IN.FUE.TUR), has carried out a monitoring programme of Antarctic tourism operations by sea 
through the port of Ushuaia. The information obtained by the programme allows for the preparation 
of numerous documents of ample publicity, intended to reaffirm international cooperation and 
provide a direct contribution in compilation of data of common interest for the organisation of a 
global conservation plan of the Antarctic environment.

The present report is based on information obtained in the recent 96-97 season and is elaborated with 
the following objectives in mind:

-   To study transit of ships and passengers which used the port of Ushuaia as stop-over in order to 
    carry out tourist trips to Antarctica;

-   Make a comparative analysis, of both ship and passenger transit, with earlier seasons and 
    different world values;

-   To know which are the most visited sites in Antarctica.

During the investigation, different information was compiled through the 'Expedition Questionnaire' 
(see annex II) presented to the heads of expeditions of each vessel which passed through the port of 
Ushuaia on its way to Antarctica. in this preliminary report, only the information relative to the set 
out objectives were taken into account.

2. RESULTS

2.1 Transit of ships and passengers through the port of Ushuaia

During the 96 / 97 season, 11 vessels employed in Antarctic tourism operated from the port of 
Ushuaia, making 94 trips and transporting a total of 6,410 passengers.

Figure 1 indicates in each case: ships flag, charter and sub-charter companies, maximum passenger 
capacity, number of trips carried out, and total number of passengers transported during the present 
season:

Of the 11 vessels which operated during the season, 8 are of Russian flag, the remaining 3 vessels 
corresponding to countries which are not part of the Antarctic Treaty System.

IN.FUE.TUR - Oficina Antártica - página 3
The vessels maximum capacity varied from 38 to 180 passengers. Small vessels (up to 100 
passengers), carried out 71 trips transporting 3,923 persons, whilst medium sized vessels (between 
100/200 passengers) transported 2,487 tourists in a total of 23 trips.

Preponderance of smaller vessels was observed throughout the season, which carried out 75% of the 
total amount of trips, the remaining part corresponding only to medium sized vessels. Furthermore, 
no large sized vessels (over 200 passengers) were registered.

2.2    Comparative analysis with previous seasons.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of Antarctic Tourism passing through Ushuaia in the last 12 years, 
taking into consideration total the number of trips, port operations and passengers. Corresponding 
percentage variations with respect to previous year are included.

Note: Data referring to seasons between 1984-85 and 1991-92 were provided by Ushuaia's Prefectura Naval 
Argentina, as up until then there was no specific Antarctic traffic monitoring programme underway in Tierra 
del Fuego. Such data is included in this report for strictly indicative purposes.

IN.FUE.TUR - Oficina Antártica - página 4
A decrease in Ushuaia's Antarctic tourism activity was observed in the 96-97 season, representing a 
10.5% decrease of trips and a 23% decrease in transported passengers in relation to the previous 
season. Therefore the continuous increase observed as from the 1992-93 season, which managed to 
treble the number of trips and double the number of passengers in the 1995-96 season.

2.3     Comparative analysis of Antarctic tourism by sea from Ushuaia in 
        relation to world totals.

Figure 3 shows a comparison of Antarctic tourist transit through Ushuaia with world total number of 
passengers that visited Antarctica by sea in the past 12 years. The "Ushuaia Passengers" column is 
divided into "Total", which indicates the number of tourists that passed through at least once, and 
"Local", which indicates those who started and finished their trip in Ushuaia. In both cases, 
respective percentages are in relation to world totals.

As in the previous Figure, a reduction in the number of world passengers which visited Antarctica can be observed, reverting the increase tendency which was registered in the last few seasons.

Notwithstanding the decrease which has been observed in the activity, we can point out that 90% of the world's passenger flow continues to pass through the port of Ushuaia. Furthermore, the constant increase in percentage of passengers who start and finish their trips in the port of Ushuaia ("Local") is maintained, representing 75% of this season's world total.

2.4    Visited sites in the Antarctic Area.

Up until the elaboration of this preliminary report, information corresponding to 90 replied questionnaires were processed, representing 96 % of the 94 trips using the port of Ushuaia. All activities carried out at the sites such as, trekking, boat rides, camping, etc., were taken into account.

With regards to sites visited during the 1996/97 season (see annex I) the following can be said:

- Tourist activity took place in 91 sites, mainly located on the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands.

- The 10 most visited sites, bearing in mind number o passengers were: Caleta Balleneros (Whaler's Bay), Isla Cuverville (Cuverville Island), Puerto Lockroy (Port Lockroy), Base Alte. Brown (Alte. Brown Station), Punta Hannah (Hannah Point), Isla Media Luna (Half Moon Island), Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Harbour), Isla Petermann (Petermann Island), Isla Paulet (Paulet Island), Isla Aitcho (Aitcho Island).

- A total 813 visits to the Antarctic area were made, of which 429 were registered in the 10 sites previously mentioned, which concentrated 53 % of the activity.
