INSPECTION HANDBOOK: EXAMINATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH
Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994
of New Zealand's National Antarctic Activities

Agenda Item: 6a

Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
General Matters and Implementation by ATCPs

(Submitted by New Zealand)

Resolution 5 (1995) Antarctic Inspection Checklists provides four non-mandatory Checklists 
as an aid to Antarctic inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol 
on Environmental Protection.

2. To assist in the examination of compliance by New Zealand nationals and agencies with 
our Protocol implementing legislation - the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 - 
an Inspection Handbook has been produced comprising:
# an Introduction
# a list of major fixed sites of New Zealand activity in Antarctica
# identification of major types of New Zealand operational activities
# a single integrated Checklist for Inspection
# the full text of the Protocol and its Annexes
# the full text of the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994
# a list of documentary sources

3. A brief background to the Inspection Handbook and an explanation of the decision to 
construct a single Checklist is found in the Introduction.

4. The Inspection Handbook was first employed during December 1996 by the 
Environmental Assessment and Review Panel in its examination of New Zealand facilities and 
operations in Antarctica. A separate copy of the Checklist was completed for each site of 
New Zealand activities (Scott Base, Arrival Heights, Cape Bird, Vanda and Cape Roberts), 
and particular parts of the Checklist were used in relation to Royal New Zealand Airforce 
C-130 flights between Antarctica and New Zealand.

5. It is hoped that this Inspection Handbook will be of some interest and help to other 
Parties undertaking inspections.

INTRODUCTION

This Inspection Handbook has been written for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
as an aid to the examination of compliance with the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) 
Act 1994 - and through it, with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty.

The intention is to employ this Handbook, and specifically the Checklist herein, to examine 
the New Zealand national programme in Antarctica during December 1996. That inspection 
will, for logistics and time reasons, be largely confined to the Ross Island and Dry Valleys 
region of southern Victoria Land. The Inspection Manual has, however, been written for 
more general application.

Pending the formal entry into force of the Protocol itself, not all of the Antarctica 
(Environmental Protection) Act is yet in force. However, consistent with New Zealand's 
commitment to maximum interim application of the Protocol, the standards, obligations and 
processes found in the Act are here assumed to apply.

The primary component of the Handbook is the Inspection Checklist. Given the limited 
number of New Zealand facilities and a high coincidence of interest at these different 
facilities, a single Checklist has been produced.

This Checklist is based upon (although greatly expanded from) Checklist A - Permanent 
Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations elaborated at XIII ATCM. In accordance with 
Resolution 1 (1996) at XIX ATCM, Checklist A has been seen as a suitable basis for 
inspecting remote field camps. Since the New Zealand national programme does not operate 
any vessels, Checklist B - Vessels within the Antarctic Treaty Area has not been drawn upon. 
Despite the presence of several important Historic Huts, and the recent decommissioning of 
New Zealand's Vanda Station, Checklist C - Abandoned Antarctic Stations and Associated 
Installations has also not been employed. Vanda Station was completely removed, and 
ongoing activities at, or close to, that site can be addressed as any other current activity. The 
three Ross Island Historic Huts are each subject to continuing restoration and maintenance 
activity, and are in addition foci for visitors. New Zealand activities, and the environmental 
consequences of those activities, can readily be addressed in the same manner as any other 
current facility. Checklist D - Waste Disposal Sites is (in a slightly expanded form) appended 
to the main Checklist.

The single integrated Checklist employed here has been expanded to more fully reflect the 
obligations contained in the Protocol and its Annexes, and specific elements of the New 
Zealand implementing legislation, and in light of the particular nature of New Zealand 
facilities and activities. Additional and useful perspectives from checklists employed by 
Argentina, France/Germany, Sweden, UK/Italy/Korea, USA and Greenpeace have also been 
incorporated.

Use of the Checklist involves both questioning appropriate officials - the responsible official 
of Antarctica New Zealand or appropriate specialists (eg RNZAF or scientific personnel) -

2
and direct observation and judgement on the part of those carrying out the inspection.
Although most information will be sought in Antarctica, some elements (such as enquiries 
regarding fixed-wing aircrew familiarity with obligations, and operational precautionary 
measures) may be addressed in New Zealand prior to departure. Other information sought 
in Antarctica may not be available in the field, and in such cases confirmation of details or 
supplementary information may need to be provided from New Zealand after the inspection. 
Finally, on the basis of information obtained through the Checklist in Antarctica, it may be 
desirable or necessary to seek additional information upon return from the Antarctic.

Although a facility-by-facility approach is anticipated, within each facility the Checklist is 
structured for a systems based, rather than a building-by-building examination.
