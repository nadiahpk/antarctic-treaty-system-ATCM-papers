ANTARCTIC TOURISM -- A RESOURCE FOR SCIENCE

(Agenda item 12)

(Submitted by IAATO)
Antarctic Tourism -- a Resource For Science And Conservation

Among IAATO's objectives, is cooperation with national Antarctic programs, including support of logistics and research. A summary of collaboration during the 1996-1997 season is presented in the IAATO Report (XXIATCM/IP108). In the spirit of cost-effective, collaborative solutions to the challenges of science and logistics in the Antarctic, IAATO draws the attention of the Meeting to tourism as a resource for science and conservation.

IAATO welcomes proposals from accredited researchers with national Antarctic programs and nongovernmental organizations to support science, logistics and conservation in the Antarctic. Itineraries, operators and vessels are substantially similar from year to year, which facilitates long term planning.

Proposals can be made to individual operators or through the IAATO Secretariat:

I.  OFFER OF SUPPORT AS A RESOURCE FOR SCIENCE

A.  Regularly Scheduled Transport to the Antarctic Peninsula

(1) With more than 100 departures on 15 vessels, commercially-organized tourism provides regular and cost-effective transport to the South Shetland Islands and western side of the Antarctic Peninsula for researchers and personnel during the months of November to March. Several expeditions each year also visit the Ross Sea and other sectors of the continent.

(2) Over 100 researchers have been carried annually over the past several seasons. A modest standard per diem of $50 U.S. has been charged to cover costs.

B.  Cargo and Resupply Capability

(1) A number of vessels -- especially the converted Russian oceanographic research vessels -- have the expertise, cranes and cargo space to contribute to resupply efforts and other needs for transport of cargo.

(2) Vessels have carried cargo to Vernadsky Station and retrograded debris from Arctowski and Bellingshausen Stations in recent years.

2
(3)	These vessels are sometimes available for charter to science programs before or after the regular tourist season, obviating the need to pay for a charter from a distant port.

C.	Ships of Opportunity for Research

(1)	Much science can be conducted by researchers traveling aboard tour vessels, including, for example, observational data on seabirds, seals, whales and oceanography, brief population censuses ashore and site surveys.

(2)	IAATO particularly welcomes proposals from researchers engaged in studies of the potential impacts of tourism activities and those who are collecting data on the reference state of visitor sites. Over the past three years, researchers with the Antarctic Site Inventory have used tour vessels as a productive transportation platform.

(3)	Experienced expedition staff, many trained as researchers, can collect data following standard protocols at no cost to national Antarctic programs and Antarctic organizations. IAATO members are particularly interested in contributing to CCAMLR surveys of beached marine debris. Members have contributed navigational intelligence to the International Hydrographic Organization in the past year and reported on whale and seabird sightings and transects.

C.	Polar Logistics

(1)	Founding IAATO-member Adventure Network International is developing an initiative for the cost-effective support of science and logistics in Dronning Maud Land. Polar Logistics, the logistical arm of Adventure Network International, plans a regular air service from Cape Town to this underserved sector of the Antarctic.

(2)	Adventure Network International provides occasional air service to King George Island for researchers and personnel associated with national Antarctic programs.

(3)	ANI has also supported research at its seasonal base camp in Patriot Hills in the Ellsworth Mountains. The company has specifically solicited proposals from the Canadian research community for the full support of a researcher next season. In addition, ANI supported a meteorologist from the Uruguayan air force for the duration of the Antarctic season.

II.    ANTARCTIC TOURISM -- AN OVERVIEW
       Scope, frequency and intensity

(A)    Commercially organized tours have visited Antarctica every year from 1966,
       carrying a total of more than 75,000 people to date. The overwhelming majority
       (+/- 90 %) of tourism is ship-based -- and the actual time spent ashore is less than
       1 % than that of scientific and support personnel. In the 35-year history of regular
       Antarctic tourism, tour operators have established no permanent infrastructure.

(B)    Visits are concentrated at ice-free coastal zones in the South Shetland Islands and
       Antarctic Peninsula over the five-month period from November to March. Landings
       via inflatable boat are of short duration (+/- 3 hours),of moderate intensity (<100
       people), and of variable frequency.

(C)    About 100 commercially-organized voyages, the great majority departing from
       Ushuaia, are scheduled each year by IAATO members-- providing the opportunity
       for regular transport from South America to the South Shetland Islands and
       Antarctic Peninsula.

(D)    These expeditions have visited 150 sites in the region, many regularly. A list of
       sites visited since 1989 is included (ATTACHMENT A).

III.   ANTARCTIC TOURISM -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SCIENCE AND
       CONSERVATION
       PURPOSE AND VALUE

1.     Political support -- tourism builds a constituency of informed ambassadors for the
       conservation of Antarctica and support of national Antarctic science programs.

2.     Logistical Support -- tour vessels provide regular transport of personnel and
       supplies.

3.     Scientific Support -- tour vessels carry scientists engaged in research. Examples of
       useful research that can be conducted aboard tour vessels include seabird transects,
       photographic identification of whales, beach litter surveys, collection of
       meteorological data, and breeding censuses.

4.     Intellectual Support -- experienced tour operators provide detailed information on
       landing sites, access routes, features and other data necessary to create rational
       management plans.

                                                                   it
