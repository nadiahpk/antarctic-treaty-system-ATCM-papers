LIABILITY ANNEX TO THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

(Item 6 g of the Preliminary Agenda)

(Submitted by Germany)
Article 16 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty obliges the 
Parties to elaborate rules and procedures relating to liability for damage arising from activi-
ties taking place in the Antarctic Treaty area and covered by the Protocol.

The XVIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (7-18 October 1991 in Bonn) discussed 
the need for early consideration of an Annex on Liability and the XVIIth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting (11-20 November 1992 in Venice) agreed to convene a meeting of 
legal experts under German chairmanship.

The German Government designated Prof. Dr. Rüdiger Wolfrum, Director of the Max-
Planck-Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law in Heidelberg, as 
chairman of this meeting and entrusted him with the legal preparation for it.

After preparation through diplomatic channels a first meeting of legal experts took place 
from 18-20 November 1993 in Heidelberg. The XXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting (29 April - 10 May 1996 in Utrecht) extended, in accordance with Recommen-
dation IV-24, the mandate of the Meeting of Legal Experts. It agreed to convene an in-
tersessional legal experts meeting before the XXIst Consultative Meeting and a further legal 
experts meeting at the XXIst Consultative Meeting. The first one took place from 7 - 11 
October 1996 in Cambridge/United Kingdom. The second one is scheduled for 19 - 23 May 
1997 in Christchurch.

In March 1997 the German Foreign Office transmitted to the Parties the Chairman's Seventh 
Offering based on suggestions at the previous meetings and to the draft offering submitted 
in November 1996.
