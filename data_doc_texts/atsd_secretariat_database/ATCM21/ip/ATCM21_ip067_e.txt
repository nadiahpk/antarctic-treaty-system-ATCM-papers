1.0 Background to the Survey

At XVIII ATCM in 1994, SCAR & COMNAP offered to convene a meeting of technical experts on environmental monitoring. Two workshops were subsequently organised jointly through SCAR and COMNAP and held in October 1995 and March 1996. The workshops were aimed at providing a consensus on an approach to Antarctic monitoring that was practical, scientifically sound, realistic and cost effective while meeting the requirements of the Environmental Protocol and Antarctic Treaty. The results of the workshops were published jointly by SCAR and COMNAP in July 1996 in the report "Monitoring of Environmental Impacts from Science and Operations in Antarctica".

Prior to the second workshop in March 1996, COMNAP compiled a summary of existing information on Antarctic environmental monitoring through a survey of its members(refer Appendix I). The results of the survey were made available to all participants at the March workshop and aimed to demonstrate the existing level of Antarctic monitoring activity, to increase awareness of existing activities and to avoid duplication of information. Monitoring information was supplied by 13 countries. Following the completion of the workshop report, the COMNAP Environmental Coordinating Group requested the newly established Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON) to expand and update the survey. The intention was to provide the summary to XXI ATCM in Christchurch as a COMNAP information paper.

A further request for monitoring information was sent to all AEON members in December 1996 (refer Appendix II). Responses were provided to the AEON coordinator and information continued to be received into early April. This document incorporates the information obtained from both surveys. The contacts within each country that supplied monitoring information are listed in Appendix III.

Monitoring information is presented by country in Section 2 and has been edited by the AEON Steering Group to conform to a standard format and length. Information is presented under the following categories:
•   Existing human impacts monitoring work
•   Publications on environmental monitoring work
•   Research on baseline levels of pollutants in the Antarctic environment

Section 3 presents a brief preliminary analysis of existing Antarctic monitoring activities, based on the information presented.

COMNAP's intention is to publish this document and to ensure it is widely available. Updates or additions to this version can still be incorporated into the final document. Information should be sent in electronic format (if possible) to the AEON Coordinator, Emma Waterhouse, by 30 June 1997 at the following address.

|                                      | (connected to the Station) was analysed. A monitoring program for the  |
|                                      | future was set out in order to produce an environmental management     |

Title of Study                                 Summary

Wilderness and aesthetic                     Procedures are currently being developed for assessing wilderness 
values of the Antarctic                      and aesthetic values so that changes over time can be monitored. The 
                                             techniques will concentrate on the zone of transition between those 
                                             places that are clearly influenced by human activity and those that are 
                                             clearly untouched wilderness. Definition of the transition zone is 
                                             hoped to provide a mechanism to monitor and subsequently control 
                                             the insidious spread of station activity.

                                             determine whether viable seeds are still present.

Seals in the Vestfold Hills                  The number of Weddel seals, their pupping sites and the number of 
                                             pups successfully reared has been monitored over 20 years. This data 
                                             set could provide a valuable baseline for detecting the effects of station 
                                             or other human activity on seals. The number of elephant seals on 
                                             Davis beach were monitored intermittently during 1957-77 and every 
                                             year during 1978-present.

Sewage effluent                              Suspended solids (mg/L), BOD (mg/L) and dissolved oxygen are 
                                             monitored in sewage effluent routinely. Faecal coliforms have been 
                                             measured at nearshore sites on occasions.

Incinerator operations                       The weight and type of material to be incinerated and the weight of 
                                             incinerator residue have been measured on occasions at Casey 
                                             station. CO2, CO, NO, and HCl emissions have been measured on 9 
                                             occasions.

Aircraft operations                          A one-off study was undertaken in 1994-95 to assess the effects of 
                                             long-range helicopters on atmospheric particle loadings at Davis. 
                                             Atmospheric organic carbon loading, elemental concentration of 
                                             aerosol and total suspended particle mass were measured.

Station use of fossil fuels                  Fuel consumption by power houses are recorded every 3 hours and 
                                             monthly fuel consumption for power generation sets, boilers, 
                                             incinerators and vehicles are recorded. Vehicle use is monitored on a 
                                             monthly basis.

Wind blown debris                           The quantity of wind blown debris within and around stations in the 
                                             Larsemann Hills, and at Davis and Casey has been measured and can 
                                             be used as a baseline to indicate whether changing practices are 
                                             leading to improvements.

| Gas emissions at Neumayer Station     | The exhaust gases of the two diesel generators are controlled and regulated and emission data are monitored fortnightly. The generators are equipped with catalytic converters and waste heat of the two main engines is used to heat the station and to run a snow melter for the production of water.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Monitoring of waste water at Neumayer | In January 1997, a biological treatment plant was installed. After microbial decomposition the waste water is exposed to ultra-violet radiation and then discharged into an ice pit. Regular monitoring of the quality of waste water will be carried out to test the efficiency of the new system.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Monitoring of the waste stream        | When returning aboard RV "Polarstern", the base commander of the Neumayer Station and the group leaders of field operations are responsible for providing a detailed waste-checklist to the ship's First Officer and to the scientific cruise leader. The checklist includes all types and amounts of garbage and hazardous waste such as chemicals, batteries, used oil and other lubricants as well as the number of full and empty fuel drums. A waste-diary is held on the ship and at the Alfred Wegener Institute. |
| Air chemistry monitoring station at   | A considerable number of trace gases and particulate components of the air are either measured continuously or sampled for later analysis in the home laboratories. The measurements also provide information on emissions caused by combustion of liquid fuels at the station, such as exhaust gases of the station's diesel generators and snow vehicles. The combustion products routinely monitored at the observatory are carbonaceous particles (black carbon), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), condensation nuclei (CN), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Other trace compounds such as nitrogen oxides, peroxides, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, etc. are investigated on a campaign basis. |
| Human impact monitoring work on the   | The Federal Research Institute for Fisheries in Hamburg undertakes this work as well as investigations into the effects of commercial fishing activities on fish and krill stocks in the Southern Ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Airborne particulate matter monitoring | During the 1986-87 expedition the collection and the analysis of samples was planned and performed in order to obtain preliminary environmental information before the regular operation of the Base. Sampling was done at a site located 1200 m SW of the base, at an elevation of about 120 m. The sampling was concentrated on airborne particulates and freshwater to obtain their composition and background levels. During the following years sampling of airborne particulate matter was performed in more sites and analyses were focussed on inorganic and organic compounds that could give a better picture of the impact of human activities all around the Base (the most significantly heavy metals and PAH). |
| Sewage treatment plant monitoring     | The biological sewage treatment plant was monitored taking into account BOD_(5), (Biological Oxygen Demand), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), temperature, salinity, pH, conductivity, turbidity, fecal coliforms, total coliforms and streptococci. Later, BOD_(5) was measured only on a non routine basis.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Incinerator monitoring                | Difficulties have arisen with the incinerator monitoring programme. The greatest problem is due to carry out isokinetic samplings. This is partly due to the fact that the incinerator is a model especially designed for a community of about 60 people and because waste is burnt discontinuously and not homogeneously. Particulate matter sampling was performed with analysis to characterise the daily emissions.                                                                 |

| Monitoring of potable water           | Potable water is obtained from two sources; one is pumped from a small pond near the station complex during summer period and the other is pumped from a snow melter during winter period. Conductivity, rate of reverse osmosis and pH value are measured every month. An examination of a colon bacillus is made two-four times a year. |
| Grey water monitoring                 | Gray water from bathroom area (this does not include sanitary waters) and that from kitchen area were examined irregularly for BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) measurement.                                                                                                               |
| Monitoring of the waste stream        | An environmental engineer works as a logistic officer for waste management, such as waste segregation, collection and removal from the Antarctic to Japan. Waste materials are categorised into the following: batteries; fuel, used oil and other lubricants; chemicals; glass; PVC and plastics; rubber and tires; used drums; metals; light bulbs; miscellaneous wastes. These wastes are measured and returned to Japan. |
| Fuel stock                            | Approximately 380 kl of diesel fuel for power generator and an additional 160 kl for station heating, vehicle and incineration use are required annually. Fuel piping, storage tanks and related facilities are checked weekly and additional checks are conducted after storms. Fuel tanks are sounded to determine their volume and monthly consumption is checked. |
| Soil algae and oil bacteria           | Soil samples are collected annually from routine sampling sites in and around the station complex. These samples are analyzed in Japan for detecting occurrence of algae and bacteria.                                                                                                   |
| Meteorological program               | Ground base measurements of carbon dioxide, methane and ozone are routinely carried out. Air samplings for CFC and carbon isotope measurements are also made. Ozone and NO2 in the stratosphere are analyzed from measured spectrum.                                                      |
| Limnological program                  | Several lakes are selected for long term monitoring and these lakes are located from a few kilometres to a hundred kilometres away from the station complex. Water temperature, conductivity, pH, oxygen and nutrient salts are observed irregularly.                                        |
| Biological program                    | Population census of Adelie penguin and Weddell seal are carried out and several penguin rookeries are selected for this purpose. Flora and fauna in the Yukidori Valley SSSI (No 22) are monitored annually. Several sites within the SSSI are selected for long term monitoring.      |
| Oceanographic program                 | Surface water is routinely sampled along the cruise track of icebreaker between Japan and the Antarctic. Samples are analyzed for heavy metals and oil concentration.                                                                                                                   |

| Sewage outfall monitoring                      | The first work was carried out by the Korean Antarctic Summer Research Party during the 1996/1997 season. Seawater samples were collected near the sewage outfall; chemical elements such as nitrate, phosphate and pH are being analysed and bacterial number being counted. Changes in chemical and microbial characteristics will be monitored on a regular time interval. In addition, long-term monitoring on seaweed and epifaunal benthic communities near the outfall will be initiated in the 1997/1998. |

database                                              reporting system. Types of information includes; chemical and explosive use, records of collections of flora and fauna, 
                                                      entry to protected area and locations of equipment left in the field. 
                                                      Information is also gathered on the location of field parties, numbers of 
                                                      persons at each field location and duration of visits.

Scott Base sewage outfall                            The aim of this programme is to assess the environmental impact of the 
monitoring                                            sewage discharge at Scott Base on the marine environment. Specific 
                                                      objectives include identifying biological and health reasons for a 
                                                      treatment plant ie the impacts of the discharge and providing adequate 
                                                      data to enable a treatment system to be selected (if required) and/or to 
                                                      provide the basis for selecting alternative outfall sites. Sewage

                                                      study of faecal coliforms, suspended solids, BOD and nutrients in 
                                                      seawater out from the outfall to confirm the extent of degraded water; 
                                                      and a five yearly semi quantitative ecological study as well as analysis of 
                                                      shellfish for trace metals.

Scott Base incinerator                               Emissions measurements from the Scott Base incinerator were taken in 
emissions monitoring                                 January 1995 and included combustion products, flue gas 
                                                      temperature, flue gas velocity, emission of hydrogen chloride, sulfur 
                                                      dioxide and sulfuric acid mist and trace elements. The results of the 
                                                      programme will be used to make decisions regarding the future of the 
                                                      incinerator at Scott Base.

Fuel spill monitoring                                Soil sampling is carried out on a number of fuel spills at Scott Base and 
                                                      in the field. Sampling of total petroleum hydrocarbons at the sites and 
                                                      control sites will continue in order to assess the effectiveness of 
                                                      remediation activities carried out after the spills were discovered.

Photo-monitoring - Scott                             Seven fixed photo-monitoring sites were established at Scott Base in 
Base                                                  October 1994. A fixed view from each site is photographed each 
                                                      season with the aim to detect and record changes over time in the 
                                                      topography, facilities and other features of the Scott Base

Title of Study                                         Summary
Mercury in Antarctic Snow                            Snow samples were taken and analysed for mercury on the 
                                                      Antarctic Plateau, near Horseshoe Mountain. Results from 
samples on the Ross Ice Shelf in the 1987-88 season indicated 
that mercury levels, at probable <1ng/kg were very much lower 
than obtained in the Arctic or the Antarctic by other investigators.

Chemical and nutrient analysis                       Melt waters and marginal melt in the lakes of the Victoria and 
of meltwater in the Victoria and                      McKelvey Valleys were sampled during January 1990. Analysis 
McKelvey Valleys                                      includes major elements, trace metals and nitrogen and 
                                                      phosphorous-based nutrients. Chemical analysis includes 
                                                      pollutant trace metals: Cu, Zn, Pb, As and Cu. Six samples of 
tissue and skin were taken from mummified seals around the 
eastern end of Lake Vanda for analysis of traces of dioxin and 
PCB.

Atmosphere mercury levels in                         Mercury concentrations in the atmosphere in and around Scott 
the Ross Dependency                                   Base were measured during a 3 week period in January and 
                                                      February 1987. Mercury levels within Scott Base were low, 
varying in the range of 8 to 124 ng/m3. A total of 34 samples 
collected up to February 23 gives a total gaseous concentration of 
0.44 ± 0.12 ng/m3. These data are comparable to those 
measured at Lake Vanda in December 1985 and are lower than 
those recorded in New Zealand, typically about 1 ng/m3.

Measurement of trace gases                           Gas samples were taken in the Ross Sea region in 1986/87 to 
and aerosol size distribution                        measure the size distribution and concentration of aerosol, 
on the Ross Sea Region                                backed up by atmospheric boundary layer measurements at three 
                                                      sites. Aerosol and boundary layer measurements were taken over 
                                                      seven to eight day periods at each of the sites, sixteen kilometres 
east of Williams Field, MacDonalds Beach at Cape Bird, and Bratina 
Island in the dirty-ice area.

Trace elements concentrations                        Previously reported enrichment of Cu, Zn and Ni in the basal brine 
in Lake Vanda, the Onyx River                         at Lake Vanda could not be confirmed. Concentrations of Mn and 
and Don Juan Pond, Wright                            Fe in the upper levels of Lake Vanda are lower than those of the 
Valley, Antarctica                                   Onyx River, though both elements are enriched in the basal brine 
                                                      by re dissolution of descending oxide precipitates. Don Juan 
Pond is a calcium-chloride evaporite brine to the west of Lake 
Vanda. The pond is perennially unfrozen, very saline and highly 
oxidised. Of the trace elements assayed in the basal brines of 
Lake Vanda, only Pb, Zn and Sr levels are significantly higher in 
the Don Juan Pond; Cu, Ni, Co, B, and Ba levels are similar or 
slightly higher, and those of Mn and Fe lower. The solubility of Mn 
and Fe is limited by insitu formation of oxides.

The analysis of reduced sulfur                       Water column and sub-cyanobacterial mat aqueous samples were 
gases in air and melt waters by                      examined from various sites within the Bratina Island Pond study 
gas chromatography at Bratina                        area. Pond waters above the mats generally contained only 
Island                                                dimethylsulfide (DMS) and carbon disulfide (CS2). The sulfur gas 
                                                      composition of sub-mat waters was more variable, but often 
dominated by hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The only reduced sulfur 
gases detected in the atmosphere were DMS and CS2, a 
manifestation of the importance of biological activity within the 
aqueous systems of the dirty ice.

Title of Study                                  Summary
Ultratrace pollutants in                        Snow and air were sampled at a remote site on the Ross Ice Shelf 
Antarctic air and snow                         to examine the air/snow relationship for a range of impurities. Air 
                                               was filtered for analysis of natural particulate impurities (aerosols) 
                                               such as rock dust, sea-salt and sulphate and possibly for pollutant 
                                               heavy metal determination. Further samples were collected for 
                                               determination of mercury in air. Freshly fallen snow as collected 
                                               after the one major snowfall event and two snow cores down to 
                                               approximately 4 metres depth were taken. Surface snow samples 
                                               were also processed for subsequent determination of mercury. In 
                                               addition a series of samples down to a depth of 1.33m were 
                                               processed for analysis of toxic organic pollutants such as pesticide 
                                               residues and dioxins.

Sources of organic nitrogen,                   Dissolved and particulate organic material were analysed in 14 
phosphorus and carbon in                       stream waters of the McMurdo Sound region. These streams are 
Antarctic streams                              fed by glacial meltwaters and pass through catchments largely 
                                               devoid of terrestrial vegetation. Nonetheless they contained 
                                               measurable amounts of organic material in both dissolved and 
                                               particulate form. Most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 
                                               values lay in the range 1-3g C M^(-3). Higher values were recorded 
                                               close to penguin rookeries on the coast. Dissolved organic 
                                               nitrogen (DON) concentration was generally two orders of 
                                               magnitude less than DOC, and in flowing waters with rich blue-
                                               green algal growth DON increased with distance downstream.

Heavy metals in Antarctic snow                 A 70-year profile of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn has been obtained at an 
                                               inland site, Dolleman Island, and samples have also been taken 
                                               around Halley V Research Station. Background levels found in 
                                               recent snow at Dolleman Island are 0.08 ng kg-1 for Cd, 4 ng kg-1 
                                               for Pb and 0.4 ng kg-1 for Zn. Increased levels are seen up to 10 
                                               km from Halley V, but levels, even a few hundred metres from the 
                                               building, are still about 1000 times lower than typical

Existing Human Impacts Monitoring Work

Title of Study                   Summary
Ambient air quality             An ambient air quality monitoring network was established in the vicinity
                                 of McMurdo Station in 1993. The network was designed to determine
                                 the highest concentrations of selected air pollutants, to determine
                                 representative concentrations of selected air pollutants and to determine the impact on
                                 ambient air quality of significant air pollution sources. Air pollutants
                                 routinely monitored include particulate matter, total particulate and
                                 gaseous pollutants, CO, SO2, NO, NO2, and NOx.

                                 Another study currently under way at McMurdo Station is attempting to
                                 determine the contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources to
                                 particulate matter less than ten microns (PM-10) aerosol during the
                                 austral summer. The natural sources are expected to include geological
                                 dust, seasalt aerosol, and marine-biogenic sulfate.

Ambient water quality           USAP have measured ambient water quality in McMurdo Sound and
                                 around Palmer Station in 1982 and in the early 1990s. In 1982, field
                                 data was collected on tidal currents, water quality and sediments. Water
                                 samples were analysed for faecal coliforms, suspended solids, total
                                 volatile solids, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, PCBs, cyanide, 8 trace
                                 metals as well as alpha and beta radioactivity. A dye test was also
                                 conducted. In 1990-91, sea water samples were collected for coliform
                                 numeration from 40 to 50 sites in front of McMurdo Station. In 1992,
                                 water samples were again taken and analysed for conventional water
                                 quality parameters, volatile and semi volatile organics and trace metals.
                                 Lipid dosimeters were also deployed and vertical profiles of pH,
                                 dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature and turbidity were also
                                 measured.

Marine sediment                 Contaminant levels in the sediments are good indicators of long term
                                 and accumulative effects of contamination. Limited sediment samples
                                 were collected from McMurdo Station in 1982 and analysed for trace
                                 metals, PCBs, oil and grease, and gross alpha and beta radioactivity.
                                 More extensive monitoring began in the late 1980s and early 1990s at
                                 McMurdo and Palmer Stations and involved investigations of
                                 hydrocarbons, organic carbon, nitrogen, metals, chlorinated
                                 pesticides, PCBs and PCTs.

Surface snowmelt runoff         In January 1991, 12 snowmelt runoff water samples were collected
                                 from drainage ditches around McMurdo Station and analysed for 34
                                 volatile and 65 semi-volatile organic compounds, total petroleum
                                 hydrocarbons, PCBs, alpha and beta radioactivity and 18 metals. In
                                 January 1994, four snowmelt runoff samples were analysed for VOCs,
                                 SVOCs, PCBs, TPH and metals.

Soil contamination              Monitoring of soil contamination at McMurdo Station started with
                                 preliminary site investigations in 1991 followed by soil sampling at
                                 Fortress Rocks and Winter Quarters Bay and overall surveillance of
                                 hydrocarbon contamination in 1995. At Palmer Station, soil
                                 contamination monitoring has also been carried out at Palmer Station.
                                 Contamination of soils at McMurdo Station is mostly related to fuel spills
                                 and the past practice of waste disposal and correlates well with
                                 operational activities carried out on the sites investigated but does not
                                 appear to pose an imminent human health risk.

Title of Study                                 Summary
Marine benthos                                McMurdo Station
                                              As part of a long term USAP benthic monitoring program, a 
                                              comprehensive study of the benthic community around McMurdo 
                                              Station was conducted between 1988 and 1993. Three general types 
                                              of benthic information was collected - structure of the community, 
                                              physical sedimentary environment and anthropogenic contamination in 
                                              sediment, clams and fish tissue. Field observations indicated that 
                                              benthic communities are highly impacted by chemical contamination.

                                              More recently, a study has been established to determine if sewage-
                                              derived organic material is assimilated by the benthic food web and its 
                                              extent of influence and if there is a biological response to 
                                              anthropogenic organic enrichment and how this compares to natural 
                                              enrichment by seals. A secondary purpose will be to understand the 
                                              relative contribution of different organic sources to the benthos and 
                                              the way that this material moves through the food web. The 
                                              investigation will test the hypothesis that sewage influence is greater 
                                              than previously thought.

                                              Palmer Station
                                              As part of the environmental monitoring program following the fuel spill 
                                              incident of the Bahia Paraiso near Palmer Station in January 1989, an 
                                              investigation was carried out on the contamination in limpets near the 
                                              station. Limpet tissue was analysed for aliphatic and aromatic 
                                              hydrocarbons, PCBs and trace metals.

Air emissions                                 Incinerator and power plant
                                              In December 1992, air emissions tests were performed on the power 
                                              plant and interim incinerator at McMurdo station. Results showed that 
                                              the interim incinerator performed better than EPA requirements for 
                                              larger incinerators in five parameters.

                                              Aerosols
                                              This work involves investigation of anthropogenic activities in Antarctica 
                                              which have the potential of producing both contemporaneous and 
                                              long-term environmental impacts on pristine surroundings. One of 
                                              these impacts arises from the emission of "black" or "elemental" 
                                              carbonaceous aerosols from the exhaust of diesel-powered generators 
                                              and vehicles used to support Antarctic operations. The results of this 
                                              work will contribute to the determination of the station's environmental 
                                              impact resulting from combustion-derived emissions.

Wastewater discharge                          Regular monitoring of wastewater discharge has been instituted at 
                                              McMurdo Station since 1989. A composite wastewater sampler was 
                                              installed at the sewer outfall in 1992/93, allowing the collection of flow-
                                              proportional 24 hour composite samples. Routine analysis of 
                                              wastewater samples include BOD5, COD, suspended solids, volatile 
                                              suspended solids, total dissolved solids, ammonia, total Kiejdahl 
                                              nitrogen, total phosphorus, selected trace metals and organic 
                                              compounds. Selected samples are analysed for volatile and semi 
                                              volatile compounds, pesticides and PCBs. Results indicate that the 
                                              wastewater if typical of domestic wastewater. Limited samples were 
                                              also collected in 1994 and 1995 at Amundsen-Scott South Pole 
                                              Station. Sampling was initiated at Palmer Station in 1994.

3.0 Preliminary Analysis of Existing Antarctic Monitoring Activities

This summary documents the existing level of environmental monitoring activity currently being carried out in Antarctica. The information provides an accessible reference, including contacts, for those designing or initiating monitoring programmes so that effective use can be made of existing experience. The information could also be used to identify gaps in the current Antarctic environmental monitoring studies. Improved accessibility to existing data sets and information such as this, will be essential to the success of new environmental monitoring regimes developed to fulfil the requirements of the Environmental Protocol.

The summary also highlights the diverse and variable range of monitoring studies that are being carried out. Although two requests were made for information, it is recognised that this document is most likely incomplete in its coverage of all environmental monitoring activity currently being carried out in Antarctica. It does however provide a fairly comprehensive indication of the types of studies undertaken and the range of impacts and parameters that are being monitored. The summary also highlights the continuing confusion over the definition of environmental monitoring, compared to, for example, baseline studies and environmental research.

A preliminary analysis of the information provides an indication of the most common types of monitoring studies and programmes being conducted. A list of the general types of monitoring studies reported most frequently in this summary is presented in table 1.

MNAP Notice No. 130
Subject: Environmental Monitoring

The first of the two Environmental Monitoring Workshops was held in Oslo from 17 to 20 October,
1995. As a result of that meeting, and in order to prepare for the second Workshop, it is necessary
to collect more information on the monitoring already being carried out by Antarctic operators. This
information will also be useful in demonstrating to the ATCM the existing level of activity, in assisting
those who are designing monitoring programmes to make use of existing experience, and avoid
duplication in generating information that is already in existence.

The information you are asked to provide is:

1 Existing human impacts monitoring work: title and a one paragraph summary of each
   monitoring project,

2 List of publications on monitoring work.

3 Any research which provides information on baseline levels of pollutants in the Antarctic
  environment (ie away from bases).

ACTION 10-95. Forward a summary of existing environmental monitoring activities to reach
the secretary by 1 February 1996.

By direction.

Alfred N. Fowler
Executive Secretary

Appendix II: Message sent to AEON members 20 December 1996

Dear AEON Members

RE REQUEST FROM COMNAP ENVIRONMENTAL COORDINATING GROUP

The COMNAP Executive and Environmental Coordinating Group (ECG) have requested that AEON be tasked with the expansion and updating of the summary provided to the Texas monitoring workshop on environmental monitoring work being carried out by national Antarctic programmes. This adapting was agreed to at COMNAP Meeting VIII (Cambridge).

The intention is to present the summary as an information paper to the XIX ATCM. AEON has been asked to provide a first draft of the revised document to the COMNAP ECG from material provided by environmental officers. The draft should be completed for circulation to CMNAPs by 17 March 1997. The information paper from this material will then be finalised by the ECG by 1 April for sending to the ATCM host.

The following actions are therefore requested of AEON members.

1. Review the document "Preliminary Response to the COMNAP Survey of Existing Environmental Monitoring Activities in Antarctica" put together by A.N. Fowler for COMNAP in March 1996 for your country and provide details of any changes to the information provided.

2. In addition, please provide details of the following information where it is not already included in the document:
	•	The title and a one paragraph summary of existing human impacts monitoring work
	•	A list of publications on monitoring work
	•	Any research which provides information on baseline levels of pollutants in the Antarctic environment (ie away from bases).

3. Please provide the above information to Emma Waterhouse, AEON Coordinator, by 28 February 1997.

Best regards
Emma Waterhouse
