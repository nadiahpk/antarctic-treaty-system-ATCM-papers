SCAR                                                         is pleased to participate in this meeting and looks 
                                                               forward to contributing towards its success.

The year 1996-97 since XX ATCM has been a busy year for SCAR. 
The XXIV SCAR Meeting was held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, 
5-16 August 1996, when many important decisions concerning 
organization, functioning and strategy were taken, including the 
SCAR relationship with the ATCM. All the SCAR Working 
Groups and some Groups of Specialists met in Cambridge and some 
workshops were held. The most important of these activities, 
including those relevant to the work of the Antarctic Treaty System, 
are reported here.

The Full Membership of SCAR has not changed. The closer 
relations with the Council of Managers of National Antarctic 
Programmes (COMNAP) are strengthening cooperation, leading to 
more effective execution of scientific research in the Antarctic.

SCAR continues to be active in initiating, promoting and 
coordinating a diversity of scientific activities, but only a few can be 
briefly noted here.

The SCAR Global Change Programme has re-structured its 
organization to coordinate all SCAR global change research in the 
Antarctic. There are now seven individual programmes within the 
overall global change programme. The SCAR Global Change 
Programme Office is operational at the Cooperative Research Centre 
for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, University of 
Tasmania, Hobart, with a full-time Programme Coordinator is in 
post. The Programme Office is providing support for all the seven 
SCAR programmes that have a global change component. The 
Programme Office also acts as the formal institutional linkage

                                                                   Appendix 3

between SCAR and the International Geosphere-Biosphere          SCAR CHIEF OFFICERS
Programme (IGBP) / World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)        (March 1997)
through the System for Analysis, Research and Training (START)
framework. The Group of Specialists has now assumed the role of
the START Regional Committee for the Antarctic.

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and
Conservation (GOSEAC) met in Puerto Iguazú, Argentina, during
June 1996 and will meet in Bremerhaven, Germany, during July
1997. The work of GOSEAC is increasingly relevant to the Protocol
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The
combined report of the two SCAR-COMNAP workshops on
environmental monitoring in the Antarctic has been distributed to
all Antarctic Treaty Parties. A joint SCAR-COMNAP Working
Paper, listing the key conclusions of the workshops and making six
recommendations will be tabled at this meeting. SCAR strongly
believes that the object of such monitoring should be to provide
efficiently, effectively and at minimum cost, a continuing index of
the health of the Antarctic terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at both
local and regional levels.

The Groups of Specialists on Structure and Evolution of the
Antarctic Lithosphere and on Cenozoic Palaeoenvironments of the
Southern High Latitudes have been closed, having completed their
objectives. However, the ANTOSTRAT project will continue for
two years to provide advice to the Ocean Drilling Program. The
Group of Specialists on Southern Ocean Ecology has also been
closed and the EASIZ programme will continue to operate under
the SCAR Global Change Programme.

The development of the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) at the
International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research
(ICAIR) here in Christchurch, New Zealand is progressing. A
demonstration of the AMD to Antarctic Treaty Parties is planned for
the first week of this meeting. The SCAR-COMNAP ad hoc
Planning Group on Antarctic Data Management has been replaced
by a Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management to support
Antarctic data management and development of the AMD.

These are some of the highlights of SCAR's diverse activities.
SCAR is planning to table two Working Papers (one jointly with
COMNAP) and six Information Papers (one jointly with COMNAP)
at this meeting. In these and other ways SCAR wishes to maintain
its input of scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System.

1. INTRODUCTION

Since XX ATCM in Utrecht, The Netherlands, May 1996, the XXIV SCAR 
Meeting was held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, 5-16 August 1996 when all 
the SCAR Working Groups met during the first week and the SCAR Delegates 
met during the second week. During the SCAR Meeting, the SCAR and 
COMNAP Executives held a joint meeting.

The membership of SCAR is unchanged at 25 Full Members and 7 Associate 
Members (see Appendix 1). The membership of the Executive Committee 
(Appendix 2) and the Chief Officers of SCAR subsidiary groups (Appendix 3) 
changed at the SCAR Meeting as a result of elections. In addition, the Groups of 
Specialists on Structure and Evolution of the Antarctic Lithosphere, on Cenozoic 
Palaeoenvironments of the Southern High Latitudes and on Southern Ocean 
Ecology have been closed. The SCAR-COMNAP ad hoc Planning Group on 
Antarctic Data Management has also been closed and has been replaced by a Joint 
Committee on Antarctic Data Management.

The Group of Specialists on Southern Ocean Ecology was co-sponsored by the 
Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) and provided a direct link in 
relation to research in the Southern Ocean. SCAR is currently preparing a 
proposal for closer liaison with SCOR and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission (IOC) to improve coordination in Southern Ocean research, 
identifying gaps and any potential overlaps in programme cover to ensure 
maximum efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in terms of global change 
studies.

Professor Rüdiger Wolfrum attended the XXIV SCAR Meeting and gave a 
valuable presentation on the current state of negotiations towards a sixth annex 
on environmental liability to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty. Subsequently, SCAR was invited to participate in the 
intersessional meeting of the Legal Expert Group and presented a statement of 
the SCAR position in relation to the proposed annex. SCAR would welcome the 
opportunity to continue to participate in these discussions in order to provide 
scientific advice as required to assist the Experts in their deliberations.

SCAR also welcomed Professor Magnus Magnusson, President of the 
International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), to the XXIV SCAR Meeting. It 
was agreed that there should be closer collaboration between SCAR and I

cooperation and identified aspects of global change research, in particular polar 
ice budget studies and the effects of increased UV radiation, as having the 
greatest potential for collaboration.

A list of papers to be presented to XXI ATCM is given at Appendix 6.

2. SCAR-COMNAP COOPERATION

SCAR and COMNAP continue to maintain routine contact through their 
Secretariats. A joint meeting of the SCAR and COMNAP Executive Committees 
was held during the XXIV SCAR and COMNAP VIII meetings in Cambridge, 
United Kingdom, during August 1996. The SCAR Executive Committee will 
meet in Capetown, South Africa, alongside the COMNAP IX Meeting during 
August 1997.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND CONSERVATION

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation held its 
eighth meeting (GOSEAC VIII) in Puerto Iguazú, Argentina, during June 1996, 
and will hold its ninth meeting (GOSEAC IX) in Bremerhaven, Germany, during 
July 1997. Many topics were discussed, including the draft report of the two joint 
SCAR-COMNAP Workshops on environmental monitoring, a "Management 
Plan Handbook" for protected areas, and five new management plans for 
protected areas.

The combined report of the two environmental monitoring workshops, the first 
in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995, and the second at College Station, Texas, 
USA, during March 1966, was distributed to all Antarctic Treaty Parties in 
November 1996. The key conclusions and recommendations of the workshops 
will be tabled as a joint SCAR-COMNAP Working Paper at this meeting. A final 
draft of the "Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic 
Specially Protected Areas" will also be tabled at this meeting. New management 
plans for protected areas were approved by SCAR Delegates as follows:

Recommendation SCAR XXIV-1
Concerning management plans for protected areas

Considering the need for effective protection of the Antarctic 
environment and in furtherance of the stated SCAR objectives of 
conservation,

SCAR recommends that National Committees forward to XXI ATCM 
via their governments the management plans for the following 
existing and proposed protected areas:
SSSI No 12:  Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Victoria Land
SPA No 5:   Beaufort Island, McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea
New Area:   Cape Evans, Ross Island
New Area:   Cape Geology and Botany Bay, Granite Harbour, 
            Victoria Land
New Area:   Lewis Bay, Mount Erebus, Ross Island

was received subsequently and the closure implemented. The Group had 
operated successfully for 10 years and had established the Ecology of the Antarctic 
Sea-Ice Zone (EASIZ) programme which has now entered its operational phase. 
The EASIZ programme will continue as a constituent programme of the SCAR 
Global Change Programme. The Group had highlighted the need for closer 
liaison with SCOR and SCAR is now investigating with SCOR and IOC the best 
way to achieve this.

The Working Group on Biology formally established a Subcommittee on 
Evolutionary Biology of Antarctic Organisms. The Subcommittee will assist in 
developing and executing integrated and co-ordinated research programmes on 
evolutionary biology and biodiversity of Antarctic organisms.

The Group of Specialists on Seals held a workshop on developing standard 
methods for census techniques for Antarctic seals. The Antarctic Pack Ice Seals 
(APIS) programme is planning a coordinated census of seals in all pack ice 
regions during the 1998-99 Antarctic field season. The census of seals will be 
performed from ships, with and without helicopter support, and by fixed-winged 
aircraft. In addition to the census, data on ice characteristics as well as the other 
biological components of the ecosystem will also be collected.

The Bird Biology Subcommittee has held two workshops, on quantitative 
methods for studies of seabirds-at-sea and on alternative marking methods for 
penguins. The main conclusion of the latter was that conventional flipper- 
banding studies should only be embarked upon with great care. The 
Subcommittee noted that South Africa was no longer able to provide financial 
support to the Central Data Bank for Antarctic Bird Banding; the Subcommittee 
resolved to request funding from SCAR. The Subcommittee also noted with 
considerable concern the downward population trends in albatrosses and some 
penguins to the extent that some species were in the process of being recognised 
as under global threat, in terms of IUCN Red List criteria.

The Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) 
Programme is now a constituent programme of the SCAR Global Change 
Programme. Two workshops, on algal taxonomy and on field instrumentation, 
are planned for 1998.

The 7th SCAR Symposium on Antarctic Biology will be held at Canterbury 
University, Christchurch, New Zealand, 1-5 September 1998. The theme for the 
symposium is "Antarctic ecosystems: models for wider understanding".

                                                             4. Antarctic Data

The Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) is now established at the International 
Centre for Antarctic Information and Research (ICAIR) here in Christchurch, 
New Zealand. The SCAR-COMNAP ad hoc group on Antarctic Data Manage- 
ment was closed at XXIV SCAR has been replaced by a SCAR-COMNAP Joint 
Committee on Antarctic Data Management. This Group will support Antarctic 
data management and the development of the AMD; the first meeting of the 
Group will take place in Christchurch during the first week of XXI ATCM. The 
development of the AMD is progressing well and Version 1.0 of the Antarctic 
Master Directory (AMD) DIF Authoring Tool (a Users Guide and Reference 
Manual complete with install/set-up diskettes) has been distributed by ICAIR.

                                                             5. The Antarctic and Global Change

The Group of Specialists on Global Change and the Antarctic (GLOCHANT) held 
its fourth annual meeting in Madison, Wisconsin, United States, during April 
1996. The SCAR Global Change Programme Office, hosted by the Cooperative 
Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment at the 
University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, now has a full-time Programme 
Coordinator providing support for the programme. There are now seven 
individual programmes that operate under the umbrella of the Global Change 
Programme:
      · Antarctic Ice Margin Evolution (ANTIME)
      · Antarctic Sea-Ice Processes and Climate (ASPECT)
      · Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS)
      · Ecology of the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (EASIZ)
      · Ice Sheet Mass Balance and Sea-level (ISMASS)
      · International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expeditions (ITASE)
      · Palaeoenvironments from Ice Cores (PICE)

All of these programmes will contribute to the relevant programmes of the 
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the World Climate 
Research Programme (WCRP) through the System for Analysis, Research and 
Training (START) framework. Workshops were held during the year by the 
ISMASS and ITASE programmes.

The membership of the Group of Specialists has been reconstituted to include 
the Chairmen of the preceding programmes and representatives from three 
other international programmes. The new Group of Specialists will now form 
the START Regional

has been provided to the responsible agencies and this has allowed forecasting to 
be improved. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global 
Telecommunications System has been monitored extensively by the FROST 
project and, as a result, the performance of the System has been noticeably 
enhanced.

A one-day symposium on “Antarctic Stratospheric Ozone”, held during the 
XXIV SCAR Meeting, illustrated the substantial progress being made towards a 
better understanding of the chemistry and dynamics of this phenomenon. New 
spectrometers using starlight are able to detect the chemistry of ozone destruction 
during the Antarctic winter before the return of the sun. The escape of ozone-
depleted air from the Antarctic into lower latitudes can now be forecast using 
existing meteorological data so that advance warning can be provided for those 
days when consequent increased ultra-violet radiation can be expected in 
Australia, New Zealand and South America. There is no indication, as yet, that 
the tide of springtime ozone depletion in the Antarctic has been turned.

Three major Antarctic experiments to provide spatial and temporal information 
about geospace are now yielding data. A network of automatic geophysical 
observatories is gathering data in magnetometry, riometry and on Very Low 
Frequency (VLF) radio waves. A network of high frequency radars is observing 
the horizontal vector velocity of the ionosphere over tens of millions of square 
kilometres, allowing the electric field to be deduced and mapped into deep space. 
The third component of the overall system is provided by the ground-based 
observations at many permanent stations in the Antarctic providing a unique 
coordinated set of experiments in the Antarctic that forms a major international 
ground-based facility. This system is supported by the Antarctic Geospace 
Observatory Network (AGONET) database that is hosted by Italy.

Antarctic astronomy continues to be an expanding field where sites at high 
altitude in the continental interior of Antarctica offer unique conditions for 
infrared and submillimetre astronomy that are up to an order of magnitude 
better than at other sites in the world. This area of research is forecast to be an 
important part of Antarctic science in the future.

                                                             7. EARTH SCIENCES AND GLACIOLOGY

The Cape Roberts Drilling Project, to investigate the history of uplift of the 
Transantarctic Mountains and the climatic history of the last 100 million years, 
was scheduled to commence drilling in October 1996, but the catastrophic 
deterioration of the sea ice forced postponement for one year.

A Field Geology Workshop in the South Shetland Islands is planned for January 
1998 to enable experts from the many countries undertaking geological research 
in the South Shetland Islands to visit outcrops together and discuss field 
relationships to achieve a shared understanding of geological significance.

An earth science expedition to Dronning Maud Land is planned for the 1997-98 
austral summer. The major aims will be to characterise the Grenvillian and 
Pan-African events and to develop techniques for distinguishing them.

                                                             6

The Working Group on Geology considered that the descriptions of many 
protected areas lacked proper appreciation of their geological significance. It was 
agreed that the appropriate member of the Group would provide the relevant 
information and SCAR Delegates adopted the following recommendation:

                                                             Recommendation SCAR XXIV-6

                                                             Concerning geological maps of protected areas

                                                             Recognizing that the exposed bedrock geology and surficial deposits 
                                                             constitute an integral part of the Antarctic environment; and

                                                             Mindful of the need to be able to assess properly the geological 
                                                             significance of any specially protected or specially managed area;

                                                             SCAR recommends that National Committees preparing management 
                                                             plans for specially protected or specially managed areas should 
                                                             provide a geological map where appropriate, showing bedrock 
                                                             outcrops and surficial deposits, as an integral part of the proposal.

The Working Groups on Solid-Earth Geophysics and on Glaciology held a 
workshop on Seismic Acquisition on Antarctica. The workshop noted the 
successful use of oversnow streamers for rapid and effective seismic data 
acquisition. A proposal to develop an oversnow seismic database was welcomed.

The Groups of Specialists on Cenozoic Palaeoenvironments of the Southern 
High Latitudes, and on Structure and Evolution of the Antarctic Lithosphere 
were closed at XXIV SCAR, having completed their planned programmes. 
Delegates agreed that the successful ANTOSTRAT project should continue for a 
further two years as a programme under the joint Working Groups on Geology 
and on Solid-Earth Geophysics. The programme would provide specialist advice 
to the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) proposals in the Southern Ocean and 
would continue to maintain the Seismic Data Library System (SDLS).

Much of the glaciological research in the Antarctic contributes directly to global 
change studies (see section 5) but there is
