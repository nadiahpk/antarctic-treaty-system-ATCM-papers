SANAE IV                                  CEE FOLLOW UP REPORT 1997

FOLLOW UP REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL 
COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION (CEE)

[The presentation of this report is consistent with the approach on CEE follow up 
procedures outlined in Information Paper No 63 tabled jointly by New Zealand and 
South Africa at ATCM XIX

This document follows the SANAE IV CEE Follow Up Report 1996 and the 95/96 
EHSMS Progress Report I

1   THE SANAE IV PROJECT

The SANAE IV Antarctic base is constructed on the inland nunatak 
Vesleskarvet 200 km from the ice shelf edge in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. 
It replaces the old SANAE III base. A Draft CEE was produced in May 1993 and 
the final report on the Draft CEE was released in October 1993. Construction 
activities commenced during the 1993/1994 summer season and continued for 
the consecutive summer seasons. The base was commissioned during the 
1996/1997 Antarctic summer.

2   SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES COMPLETED SINCE RELEASE OF THE 
PREVIOUS FOLLOW UP REPORT

All outer shells have been completed successfully, as well as most of the 
inside furnishing. The remainder of the furnishing is expected to be completed 
during the 1997/1998 season. All the life support systems were commissioned, 
including electricity generation, water generation, water purification and air 
conditioning. The heavy duty lifts in the helicopter landing pad are to be 
installed during the 1997/1998 season.

The scientific structures erected were:
-   the scientific pipe/cable system between the base and the various 
    science projects;
-   the SHARE radar antennae system with equipment hut;
-   the VLF antennae;
-   the Telemetry station;
-   the Riometer antennae system
-   the Seismometer
-   the GPS project

3   COMPLIANCE WITH THE CEE

Monitoring of compliance to the CEE, as a specific requirement of the Protocol 
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol), has 
been conducted since the project commenced in the Antarctic summer of 
1993/1994.

A Working Paper (XX ATCMWP 27) was tabled to disclose all inconsistencies 
with the CEE at the time. Although all activities remained within the 
requirements of the Madrid Protocol, the following minor deviations from the 
CEE occurred.

3.1 Personnel requirements (Draft CEE 3.6.2)

The personnel in service for the full duration of the 1996/1997 construction 
phase amounted to 120. Although most personnel were stationed at

Vesleskarvet, a small logistic support team was also accommodated at E-
base.

3.2 Accommodation requirements (Draft CEE 3.6.4)

Four additional accommodation containers were placed at the construction 
base to provide for the increased personnel component.

3.3 Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS)

     • The Waste Management Plan was reviewed. (Final CEE, 3.4)
     • The Code of Conduct was updated to adjust to changing 
       activities and deficiencies. (Draft CEE, Chapter 4)
     • A draft EHSMS Manual for the operational phase of 
       SANAE IV was produced to direct and ensure the continuation 
       of the EHS management programme.(Final CEE, Chapter 2)

4    CONCLUSION

Very few additional deviations from the CEE occurred. It can be ascribed to the 
fact that the project has now gone into the operational phase. Removal of the 
temporary accommodation facility is expected to begin during the 1997/1998 
summer. Due to the success of the adopted environmental management 
strategy, SANAP will continue its practice.
