ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING:
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

from IUCN, The World Conservation Union's 
Antarctic Advisory Committee, May 1997

I.    BACKGROUND

1.    The proceedings of the SCAR-IUCN Workshop on Environmental Education and Training, Gorizia, Italy, April 1993, have been published as Dingwall, P. and Walton, D. (eds.), Opportunities for Antarctic Environmental Education and Training, Southern Polar Regions Monograph No. 3, IUCN, Cambridge 1996.

2.    The report draws attention to a wide range of Antarctic environmental education and training programs in various nations, but notes that amongst ATCPs there are no consistent guidelines or curricula which would:

      (a)    inform visitors about the Treaty System or indicate how to minimise human impacts in Antarctica;
      (b)    provide instruction for expedition staff about environmental monitoring or environmental safeguards in Antarctica; or
      (c)    help develop appropriate specialist training about environmental science or policy, or the protected areas system in Antarctica.

3.    Attention is drawn to XIX ATCM Information Paper 62 and comments in the Final Report of XIX ATCM, Agenda Item 7(b)(6), which noted the need for an inventory of Antarctic environmental education and training programs.

4.    Some Treaty nations do have excellent programs in these areas, but this information is not widely available.

5.    At XIX ATCM, the representative of IUCN offered to approach the World Conservation Union to see whether it would be wiling to help develop a draft directory of those Antarctic environmental education and training courses currently available.

6.    IUCN agreed that its Antarctic Advisory Committee should compile an inventory of current education and training programs amongst Treaty participants. The first draft was tabled at ATCM XX.

7.    Based on that draft, it was apparent that there were gaps in the information received. Further, there was no consistency as to the types of courses offered.

                                                     Printed on Chlorine-free paper
8. IUCN understands that the UK will be tabling a paper at XXI ATCM on 
"Proposals for Education and Training in Antarctica." This paper will include a proposal 
that Working Group II of the ATCM, with the assistance of COMNAP and IAATO, 
undertakes a survey of the education and training schemes used by national Antarctic 
programs and Antarctic tour operators. On the assumption that the ATCM agrees to this 
proposal, there will still be a gap concerning information on formal education courses 
offered by nations (i.e., formal courses offered by education bodies, such as universities) 
on Antarctica. IUCN proposes to compile this data for tabling at XXII ATCM.

9. Attached is a questionnaire on formal education courses offered by nations. It 
will be circulated at this meeting to Parties, and following the meeting to SCAR, 
COMNAP and the Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON).

10. IUCN would encourage Parties to forward current information to the IUCN 
observer at this ATCM, or after this meeting, to Beth Clark, chair of the Antarctic 
Advisory Committee, at the address listed on the questionnaire.
