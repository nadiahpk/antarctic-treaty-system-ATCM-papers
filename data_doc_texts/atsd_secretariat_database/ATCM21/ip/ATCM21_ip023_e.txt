REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANISATION (IHO) TO BE
PRESENTED BY THE NEW ZEALAND HYDROGRAPHER TO THE XXI ANTARCTIC
TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING (ATCM) IN CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND, 19-30
MAY 1997

1.      Background

The IHO's Permanent Working Group on Cooperation in Antarctica (PWGCA) has rendered
reports annually to the ATCM since its establishment in 1992. This report serves to update
developments since the last report rendered to the XX ATCM in Utrecht in 1996.

2.      The IHO XV Conference

The IHO Conference is held quinquennially in Monaco. The XV Conference took place 14-25
April 1997. The Conference endorsed a proposal to redesignate the PWGCA as a regional
commission; its title is now the IHO's Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica.  Full
membership of the Committee is confined to those IHO Member States (MS) who contribute
to the International (INT) chart scheme through surveying and/or charting activity and whose
national governments have acceded to the Antarctic Treaty. Twenty-four MS are presently
registered as full members of the Committee; Ukraine is an associate member pending her
election to the IHO.

3.      Cooperation with International organisations

3.1     Throughout its existence the Committee (formerly Group) has encouraged
close liaison and cooperation with any national or international organisation with a
professional interest in Antarctica and continues to be pleased to welcome representatives of
those organisations to its biennial meetings. Liaison with the Council of Managers of National
Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) has proved to be particularly valuable. It was through
COMNAP that the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) provided
detailed annual statistics going back to 1980 which indicated a year on year increase in cruise
ships and tourists visiting Antarctica. When we analysed and plotted that data, we discovered
that cruise ships were regularly visiting four sites which are not presently included in the large
scale INT chart scheme. Moreover, we have ascertained that adequate survey data does not
presently exist to support the production of these additional large scale charts. This fact
highlights the continuing need for national governments to fund adequately those national
hydrographic services with an Antarctic surveying and charting capability. In 1995 the XIX
ATCM emphasised this fact with its formal endorsement of Resolution 1.

3.2     The provision of the IAATO statistics has also served to highlight the XIX
ATCM Resolution 3 (1995) concerning the need for tourist and non-governmental operators
to provide to their relevant national authorities details of Antarctic visits. Such data can prove
to be extremely valuable to the IHO in its continuing commitment to contribute to the safety of
life at sea through the provision of adequately resourced hydrographic surveying activity to
support the production of INT charts of Antarctica.

3.3     Cooperation has also continued with the Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR) and the IHO has released to SCAR its "Underseas Features Names
Gazetteer" for the use of that organisation.

4.       Chart production

IHO MS are continuing their steady progress in chart production. Thirty-three charts of the 
INT chart scheme are now scheduled to be produced by the year 2000.

5.       Conclusion

The IHO is pleased to assure ATCM that the twenty MS involved in the work of the Antarctic 
Committee will continue the high level of commitment demonstrated to date. These IHO MS 
continue to look to ATCM for positive action in support of the Seoul Resolutions 1- and 3-
(1995) with respect to the continued funding of national hydrographic surveying and charting 
programmes, and in the provision of data which is relevant and valuable to these 
programmes. Working together, the IHO MS will continue to support the safety of life at sea 
in Antarctica.
