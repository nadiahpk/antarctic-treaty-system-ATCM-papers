SSSI No. 14 Harmony Point, Nelson Island,
South Shetland Islands.
Management Plan
for Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 14

HARMONY POINT, NELSON ISLAND, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS

1. Description of values to be protected

This Area was originally designated as SSSI 14 in ATCM Recommendation XIII-8, after a 
proposal of Argentina and Chile, because of its diverse seabird community and extensive 
terrestrial vegetation cover and rich flora including mosses, lichens and two vascular plant 
species.

Ice free land supports large breeding colonies of 11 seabird species, and one of the largest 
single colony of chinstrap penguin. The seabird colonies, and particularly the chinstrap penguin 
colony, are still important for scientific and conservation purposes, and have shown important 
increases in the last decade. The Area supports a large (500 breeding pairs) giant petrel 
colony, a species which is highly sensitive to any kind of human disturbance and is decreasing 
in many sites in Antarctica. 
The values to be protected are those associated with the biological composition and diversity 
of this site. It is an excellent example of the South Shetland Islands maritime Antarctic seabird 
community and  terrestrial ecosystem, allowing long term research without damage or 
interference.

2. Aims and objectives

Management of Harmony Point aims to:
• protect the seabird community and terrestrial ecosystem,
• prevent unnecessary human disturbance to the Area,
• permit seabird and terrestrial ecology research without interference to provide a baseline 
for natural variability studies.

3. Management Activities

The following management activities will be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
• A marker board will be placed at the principal access point illustrating the location, 
boundaries and stating entry restrictions.
• Access to the Area and paths will be marked.

1
- Priority circulation routes within the Area will be established for transit to sample sites. Ice and marine areas included into the limits of the protected Area shall only be used under permit conditions.
- Collection of samples will be limited to the minimum required for approved scientific research.
- Control areas with restricted access will be established to monitor possible impacts of human disturbance on both the fauna and the flora.
- Visits shall be made as necessary to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.

4. Period of designation

Designated for an indefinite period.

5. Maps

Map 1 shows the location of Nelson Island and Harmony Point in relation to the South Shetland Islands. Map 2 shows the location of Harmony Point on Nelson Island. Map 3 shows Harmony Point in greater detail.

6. Description of the Area

i. Geographical co-ordinates, boundaries markers and natural features

The Area is located on the west coast of Nelson Island, between 25 de Mayo (King George) Island to the Northeast and Robert Island to the Southwest (lat. 62° 18' S; long. 59° 14' W).

The Area includes Harmony Point and the Toe, the adjacent ice and surrounding marine zone within the rectangle showed on maps 2 and 3.

Geomorphologically Harmony Point presents three well defined units: an andesitic plateau, coastal andesitic outcrops and plateau outcrops, and ancient sea levels (raised beaches). The plateau reaches 40 meters above sea level and its area is covered by detritus resulting from the destruction of andesitic rocks by freeze/thaw action, with a well-developed vegetation of mosses and lichens.

Lakes and streams with a limited flow appear on the undulations. Some isolated andesitic rocks stand out from the glacier ice, and some of them are formed on the deglaciated plateau (ancient nunataks), evidencing that the past extension of the glacier covered Harmony Point.
There are three successive raised beaches, between the coast and the westward extremity of 
the glacier. These beaches are defined by pebble accumulations of variable height.

The Area holds breeding colonies of eleven seabird species: gentoo penguin 4000 pairs, 
chinstrap penguin 120.000 pairs, giant petrel 500 pairs, cape petrel 300 pairs, blue eyed 
shag 110 pairs, sheathbill 110 pairs, brown skua 40 pairs, Dominican gull 120 pairs, 
Antarctic tern 30 pairs. Other seabirds nesting in the area are Wilson storm petrel and black-
bellied storm petrel.

There are some extensive areas covered by a very rich and diverse development of 
bryophytes and lichen-dominated plant communities, including two vascular plant species, 
especially in the areas less affected by recent perturbation or breeding activities. Moss turf 
subformations are located in wind protected and moist places, whilst lichen-dominated 
subformations occur in places with a high wind exposure.

ii. Restricted zones within the Area

There are no prohibited zones in the Area but access to bird breeding areas should be 
restricted during the breeding season (September to March) and damage to vegetation 
should be avoided by limiting access to the marked paths.

iii. Location of structures within the Area

There is a refuge measuring 4.5 by 3.5 m, that can house three scientists, and a storage 
building. These installations are used only during spring and summer. There is an Argentine 
navigation light on the westmost point of Harmony Point.

iv. Location of other Protected Areas within close proximity.

SPA No. 16, Coppermine Peninsula, Robert Island lies about 30 km south-west. SSSI No. 
13, Potter Peninsula, 25 de Mayo (King George) Island lies about 30 km east-north-east. 
SSSI No. 5, Fildes Peninsula, 25 de Mayo (King George) Island lies about 23 km north-
east. SSSI No. 8, Western Shore of Lasserre / Admiralty Bay, 25 de Mayo (King 
George) Island lies about 45 km east-north-east.

7. Permit conditions

Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a permit issued by appropriate 
national authorities.

Condition for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:
• It is issued only for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere.
• The actions permitted will not jeopardise the natural ecological system in the Area.

i. Access to and movement within the Area

Access to Harmony Point area from the sea, which is the preferred method, is restricted to the pebble beach 400 m south-west to the refuge There is a blind navigation light located in the westmost point of Harmony Point. Access to the navigation light is by boat from the coast at the south of the light. Special access points are not specified for the Toe but access is limited to inflatable boats.

Aircraft landings should be avoided where practicable. Small planes could land on the glacier but flights over the area are not allowed. Helicopters must not overfly any of the major bird breeding areas, and should land only in the vicinity of the refuge or landing beach Map 3 shows proposed helicopter flight route. It is forbidden to overfly the area below 250 meters above the highest point except for access to the landing point specified above. Pedestrians must use established routes, particularly during the bird breeding season. Vehicles are prohibited in the area.

ii. Activities which are or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place.

• Compelling scientific research which cannot be undertaken elsewhere and which will not jeopardise the ecosystem of the area.
• Essential management activities, including monitoring.

iii. Installation, modification or removal of structures

No additional structures are to be erected in the Area, or scientific equipment installed, except for essential scientific or management activities, as specified in the Permit.

iv. Location of field camps

materials introduced are to be removed when no longer required. Permanent depots are not 
permitted.

vi. Taking or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
This is prohibited, except in accordance with a Permit. Where animal taking or harmful 
interference is involved this should be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for 
Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica, as a minimum standard.

vii. Collection and removal of anything not brought into the area by the Permit holder
Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a Permit, 
except that of debris of man-made origin may be removed from the beaches of the Area and 
dead or pathological specimens of fauna or flora may be removed for laboratory 
examination.

viii. Disposal of Waste
All non-human wastes shall be removed from the Area. Human waste may be deposited in the 
sea.

Waste resulting from research activities in the Area may be stored temporarily beside the 
refuge to await its removal from the Area at the first opportunity. Any such stored waste 
must be adequately contained, marked as waste and secured against accidental loss.

ix. Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the 
Management Plan continue to be met
