1. This report covers events regarding the Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) from May 1996 to the
present. Events prior to May 1996 were reported to the XVIIIth,
XIXth and XXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (see Annex
B, Annex F and Annex F of the respective Final Reports).

2. Following the decision at the informal meeting of Contracting
Parties in Tasmania in October 1993 that Parties should comply
fully with the reporting requirement of Article 5 (Capture and
Killing of Seals) of the Convention, the UK as depositary
reminded Parties of this obligation by Diplomatic Note on
1 August 1996. The results are reproduced as Annex A to this
report.

3. As agreed at the above informal meeting the UK as depositary
will remind Parties that returns for 1997 (for the period 1 March
1996 to 28 February 1997) should be transmitted to the UK and
SCAR by 30 June 1997.

4. Since the XXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting there
have been no accessions to the Convention for the Conservation of
Antarctic Seals. A list of countries which were original
signatories of the Convention, and of countries which have
subsequently acceded, is attached (Annex B to this Report).
