FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS "MINOR" AND "TRANSITORY"
Agenda Item 6 b
Submitted by New Zealand

BACKGROUND

1. In March 1997, New Zealand circulated a Discussion Paper entitled 'Further Understanding of the Terms "Minor" and "Transitory"' to Parties and experts. The paper was presented as what we termed a "Conceptual Model" - a means of thinking about the issue, rather than a blueprint for immediate application.

2. Although it drew from the ideas sent to us by several colleagues in other State Parties, it represented New Zealand thinking about the issue. Its purpose was to provide a focal point around which others' thinking might coalesce, or alternatively stimulate others to propose different approaches. In either instance its intention was to provide a starting point for discussion.

3. New Zealand wishes to express its appreciation to Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Norway, Peru, Russia, Sweden, United Kingdom, Canada, ASOC and IUCN for their contributions to intersessional discussion of this topic. We would like to thank in particular Dr Tito Acero of Argentina for his detailed and helpful contributions throughout the past six months.

4. Whilst the revised text here cannot claim to do full justice to all of the comments received, it does draw upon those contributions. New Zealand does not suggest that any of these Parties or individuals concur with our present text (hence we do not identify the source of comments). However we do hope that it may be considered a helpful contribution to our further understanding of these terms.

INTRODUCTION

5. New Zealand has interpreted the Protocol as using the concepts of "minor" and "transitory" to achieve a three tiered level of EIA, with activities identified as potentially having:

a) less than a minor or transitory impact

b) a minor or transitory impact, or

c) more than a minor or transitory impact
                                                  1
6. If a proposed activity is determined as having less than a minor or transitory impact as a 
result of "Preliminary Stage" consideration under Annex I - for some Parties this constitutes 
a Preliminary Assessment (PA) or Preliminary Environmental Evaluation (PEE) - it may 
proceed.

7. Otherwise, an Initial or Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (IEE or CEE) must be 
carried out. The break point between IEE and CEE comes where the activity as proposed is 
likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact.

8. Thus, there is a presumption that the appropriate level or type of EIA for:

# less than minor or transitory impact =Preliminary Stage/PA/PEE
# a minor or transitory impact = IEE
# more than minor or transitory impact = CEE

9. It was usefully pointed out to us, and we agree, that the "levels" of EIA need not be seen 
as isolated and static. The carrying out of the evaluation is what actually enables us to 
determine what the level of impact is likely to be, and a "lower" level evaluation may lead 
to the decision that a "higher" level evaluation is required. Of course this is stated explicitly 
in relation to the IEE/CEE breakpoint in Article 3.1 of Annex I to the Protocol.

10. The terms "minor" and "transitory" are clearly critical for the determination of EIA level, 
and New Zealand has settled on a three-tiered system, with specific obligations following for 
each. Accordingly, it seemed to us necessary to build these formal commitments into our 
model from the start. From the contributions received, it appears that many other Parties agree 
that we have a three-tiered system of EIA and that the Preliminary Stage does require an 
active process of evaluation.

A CONCEPTUAL MODEL

11. The conceptual model is intended to provide a framework for looking at the issue. It is 
a step in clarifying our thinking, not a methodology which can be directly applied to specific 
situations.

12. The majority of contributions identified the "Conceptual Model" as a helpful tool. A 
number of Parties also expressed the hope (shared by New Zealand) that ultimately we should 
reach a model that could be put to practical application. This might involve the promulgation 
of guidelines based upon some of the more common scenarios in Antarctica to assist Parties.

13. Our approach has been to separate the scaling terms "minor" and "transitory", in an 
attempt to more easily identify their presumed intention, and to then model each at the three 
levels represented by PEE, IEE and CEE.

14. We suggested that "Minor[iness]" related to the MAGNITUDE of the impact and 
"Transitory[ness]" to the DURATION of the impact. There appears often to be a confusion 
                                                                                 2
between the duration of the impact and the duration of the causal activity, and it is the former 
which concerns us here. It may also be the case that there is a lag time before an impact is 
felt.

Thus:

"less than a minor or transitory impact" is impact of:
VERY LOW MAGNITUDE and/or VERY SHORT DURATION

"a minor or transitory impact" is impact of:
LOW MAGNITUDE and/or SHORT DURATION

and

"more than minor or transitory impact" is impact of:
APPRECIABLE MAGNITUDE and/or EXTENDED DURATION

the question then becomes one of setting the limits or breakpoints for magnitude and duration.

15. Note that our initial approach has been to treat magnitude and duration as having equal 
weight and importance. However, it has been suggested that greater weight should be assigned 
to duration.

16. Plainly, we cannot employ absolute values for magnitude or duration in a general model 
(important as they would be in an actual situation). The limits/breakpoints are context 
dependent, and that context includes value judgement. But, they should have some 
correspondence to the actual ecological situation, ie to the natural environment of the 
Antarctic and its dependent and associated ecosystems.

17. We entirely agree with colleagues who have pointed to the importance of factors beyond 
simply the duration and magnitude of impacts - although our consideration was necessarily 
confined to these terms. These other factors dictate the context within which the terms are 
used. They include the significance of the location or space in which the impact might be felt, 
the instrumental and intrinsic values attributed to both the site of the activity and the activity 
itself, the probability of impact and the confidence limits of our judgements. In the case of 
values, some guidance is already found in Article 3 of the Protocol and various existing 
Antarctic documents - eg Protected Areas Management Plans and the developing case history 
of actual EIAs. Value may also depend on whether the area has, or has not, previously been 
impacted. The value attributed to various Antarctic "goods" obviously depends upon many 
factors and varies with communities and time.

18. Ideally, we should have knowledge of (i) basic ecosystem functioning and the degree of 
interdependence between ecosystems and communities, (ii) likely ecological consequences of 
perturbations given the resilience of the ecosystem or community and (iii) the actual initial 
environmental reference state at the site(s) in question. The resilience of the ecosystem or 
community affected was raised by many correspondents as a key issue in determining 
                                                                                  3
potential impact.

19. However, in situations where we do not have all of this knowledge (probably a high 
proportion of cases) we still need to make decisions. In these cases we will therefore need to 
utilize interim assumptions, based upon the best available information or judgements. The 
employment of these will at least give us testable hypotheses, and hopefully aid us in gaining 
the more robust knowledge we would prefer.

20. As a departure point for discussion, the model scales DURATION as:

# very short duration (< 1to 100 days)
# short duration (month(s) to a year - the Antarctic season perhaps)
# extended duration (year(s) to decades)

with the full recognition that the actual scale used in real situations will vary with 
circumstances.

and MAGNITUDE as:

# very low magnitude (undetectable change within or close to natural variability)
# low magnitude (detectable, ie above natural variability)
# appreciable magnitude (detectable and well above natural variability by a given amount - 
say N% of a given parameter such as population, area, 'quality', etc).

21. Note that whereas duration is a relatively simple concept, magnitude is a more diffuse 
concept, varying with the type of impact. It embraces a range of components: eg (i) the 
number of ecosystem constituents impacted (which might be species, populations, habitats, 
biophysical components, instrumental and intrinsic values, and so on) (ii) the type and 
intensity of effect for each of these, and (iii) the spatial extent of the effect - from very 
localised to regional or even global. Further, the components of magnitude may change over 
the lifetime of an impact - eg the spatial area may increase or decrease. "Magnitude" could 
clearly benefit from further consideration.

AN EXAMPLE - HUMAN IMPACTS AT A PENGUIN COLONY:

Duration:

22. If we assume that impacts can be identified, it should be possible to assign nominal likely 
durations for each. (We do not have to wait until we have absolute certainty about duration).

23. Thus, behavioural disturbance from a single 5 hour visit might reasonably be assumed to 
have a duration itself measured in hours [VERY SHORT], whereas trampling of ground, or 
actual exposure of penguin chicks to skua predation might have an impact measured over the 
longer period of a season [SHORT] long after the departure of the visitors. Catastrophes 
resulting from the visit, such as the introduction of avian diseases (eg via poultry products) 
which result in substantial loss of breeding birds from the population or an entire season's 
chicks, probably extend the impact over years [EXTENDED].

Magnitude:

24. For each impact identified, it will also be necessary to attach some magnitude. If the magnitude is such that the impact cannot be differentiated from natural variability - eg there may be a slight increase in penguin chick mortality, but this cannot be distinguished given the much greater natural chick mortality (and inter-seasonal variability), then the impact is undetectable (VERY LOW). It may be detectable (LOW), and with increasing baseline knowledge and improvements in technique, more changes/impacts will become detectable. In the case of our penguin colony, eg a demonstrable abandonment of nest sites along the route of regular human access to the colony might constitute a LOW magnitude impact.

25. An impact of APPRECIABLE magnitude could be the example of impact used above to exemplify an EXTENDED impact too, the introduction of an avian pathogen. Perhaps a more obvious example might be the construction of a new Antarctic station or other major infrastructure on, or close to, the site occupied by our penguin colony.

Integrating Magnitude and Duration of impacts:

26. For both MAGNITUDE and DURATION there are assignments which will make an extreme value for either a sufficient criterion for determining whether the activity is likely to have less than, just, or more than minor or transitory effect.

27. Thus a proposal that involved risk of appreciable magnitude (eg extirpating N% of the colony) would a priori be a more than minor or transitory effect. The duration factor would be secondary. Of course it is likely that a displacement of this magnitude would have, as its necessary corollary, more than a very short duration. Note that we are not talking here only of the length of time the birds are displaced, but the time taken to recover from the displacement - and this may be a matter of a season (SHORT) up to years (EXTENDED).

28. Similarly, an EXTENDED impact (here measured in years) would a priori be taken as more than minor or transitory, independent of magnitude (this is not to prejudge the acceptability of it going ahead, merely to recognise that it is plainly not a transitory impact).

29. Were the impact seen as likely to be both appreciable in magnitude and extended in duration it would clearly constitute more than a minor or transitory impact.

30. At the other end of the scale, if an impact is undetectable in magnitude, then irrespective of its duration it falls into the category of a less than minor or transitory impact. The logic here being that if one cannot actually distinguish the magnitude of the impact from natural variability, there is no practical basis on which to judge otherwise.

31. Obviously the situation becomes more complex with those cases in between, where the magnitude may be low, but the duration extends from very short, through short to extended. These are the cases where the particularities of a real situation will be critical. At the level of this conceptual model, it seems appropriate to assign a low magnitude but short duration impact to the category of minor or transitory impact, but the final determination here (as in the case of low magnitude and very short duration impacts) will be contingent upon the actual
5
case.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

32. Hitherto, most Antarctic EIAs appear to have arrived at their conclusions in regard to whether an activity is likely to have less than, only, or more than minor or transitory impact across the whole field of a proposal. The determination of the level of impact is made as if this is uniform across all sorts of impact.

33. One could make the evaluations, and therefore the constituent assessments of magnitude and duration, separately for "direct", "indirect" and "cumulative" impacts of an activity. This would offer gains in the resolution at which one viewed environmental impact, but then integrating this to enable a practical decision to be made about the entire proposal is certainly problematical.

34. These considerations add further complexity to the issue. Certainly, none of the responses to the New Zealand paper suggested immediate ways forward here.

FUTURE WORK

35. New Zealand believes that the discussion of the terms "minor" and "transitory" carried out in the intersessional exchanges has been useful. By standing back from the specifics of actual EIAs, we hope that some additional insights into the complexities of interpretating these terms have been gained.

36. Although exchanges on the interpretation of "minor" and "transitory" will no doubt continue, New Zealand is of the opinion that it is now time to move towards the development of practical guidelines, drawing upon not only the experience of this process, but the substantial developing case histories provided in actual Antarctic EIAs, audits/reviews and related documents.
