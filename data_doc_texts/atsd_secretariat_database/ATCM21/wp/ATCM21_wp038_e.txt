Resolution X (1997)

Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE):
Methodology for Implementation of Activities for which a
CEE has been Prepared

The Representatives,

Recalling Annex I, Article 3 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that further guidance is desirable for following up on the implementation of
activities for which CEEs have been prepared under Annex I of the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;

Encourage Consultative Parties to:

1. Include in their procedures for assessing the environmental impacts of their
activities in Antarctica, provision for independent review of the activities undertaken
following the completion of a CEE.

2. Adopt the following process for CEE follow-up:

      (a) Review of activities conducted following completion of a CEE to ensure
that the activities are conducted as authorised and in compliance with any
applicable mitigation measures;

      (b) Circulate to Parties, and forward to the TEWG/CEP, a summary of the
steps taken to implement the activities for which a CEE has been prepared;

      (c) Notify any changes to the activities described in the CEE and the
reasons for the changes;

      (d) Report to the ATCM on the outcome of this process.
