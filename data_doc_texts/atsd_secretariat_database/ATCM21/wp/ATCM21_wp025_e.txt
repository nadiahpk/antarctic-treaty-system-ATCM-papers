DRAFT RESOLUTION

The Representatives,

Recalling Resolution 3 (1995) which agreed that there would be an advantage in standardised reporting of information on tourism and non-governmental activity in Antarctica;

Noting that Attachment A to Recommendation XVIII-1 outlines the requirements for Advance Notice of tourism and non-governmental activities but does not outline requirements for post-activity reports;

Recalling that Parties agreed at ATCM XX to trial a standard format for Advance Notification and Post-Visit Reporting during the 1996-97 Antarctic season.

Recommend that:

Parties agree to adopt the trial format (as attached) as the standard format for use in advance notifications and Post-Visit Reporting on tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica.

Standard format for reporting on Tourist and Non-Governmental activities
in Antarctica

1.      At the last three Antarctic Treary Consultative Meetings the Antarctic Treaty Parties agreed on
        the reporting requirements for tourist and non-Governmental expeditions — for Advance
        Notification (Attachment A to Recommendation XVIII-1, Kyoto 1994) and for Post-visit
        Reporting (Resolution 3 (1995)). At the XX ATCM (Utrecht, 1996) proposed standard formats
        for Advance Notification and Post-visit Reporting were agreed for adoption for a trial period of
        one year. New Zealand adapted the forms for general use and distributed these to other Parties
        and IAATO. IAATO offered to provide comment on use of the form in the 1996-97 season to
        the XXI ATCM.

2.      Trial implementation of the Post-visit reporting format was completed in the 1996-97 season,
        comments on which have been provided by IAATO in XXI ATCM/INF **.

3.      Minor modifications are recommended for consideration prior to adoption of the format as a
        standard which could be used by all tourist and non-Governmental expeditions when reporting
        their activities.

        The minor modifications suggested are as follows:
        •     In the Post-visit Report Expedition Record, space has been provided for dates and
              locations in the expedition itinerary, which facilitates easier data entry to a database;
        •     in the Post-visit Report Site Visit Record, both the date and time of the departure and
              return for a site visit is requested to allow for site visits that take place spanning more than
              one day.

5.      A draft format for Advance Notification and for Post-visit Reporting on Tourist and non-
        Governmental activities identical to the format adopted for trial but incorporating these minor
        modifications is provided in Attachments A and B to this paper.
