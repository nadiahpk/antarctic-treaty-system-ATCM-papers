ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

Agenda item 6e              Submitted by Chile

XXI ATCM/WP21

WORKING DOCUMENT

TOPIC: ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

BACKGROUND:

The Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol stipulate that the Antarctic is designated as a natural reserve dedicated to peace and science. Furthermore, it prohibits any activity related to mineral resources, with the exception of scientific research, and it makes reference in Article 8 to the preliminary evaluation on the impact of scientific research programmes, tourism and all other government and non-government activities within the Antarctic Treaty area, including activities related to logistical support.

The appendices to the Protocol establish specific measures for protection of the environment:

Appendix I:     Evaluation of impact on the environment
Appendix II:    Preservation of Antarctic fauna and flora
Appendix III:   Elimination and treatment of waste
Appendix IV:    Prevention of marine pollution

Within this regulatory framework, Chile has developed a National Plan for Research, Monitoring and Control of Water Pollution which takes into account, among other things, the Coastal Environment Monitoring Programme (POAL), which, for the Antarctic, has clear and well-defined objectives entailing compliance with the recommendations of the abovementioned Protocol.

The general objective of the Antarctic POAL is to determine the base concentration levels of the main marine contaminants, particularly those which arise from ground sources as they are permanent and potentially serious, for example that caused by the movement of shipping.

Specific objectives involve evaluating the base levels of the bodies of water which are subject to monitoring, thus allowing the environment to retain its pristine condition. Other specific objectives have the aim of supplying background information to provide support in the establishment of environmental quality standards, identifying trends and concentrations of contaminants hazardous to human health and hydrobiological resources, monitoring the results of the application of mitigating measures, and detecting possible changes in the pattern of environmental behaviour of the bodies of water subject to monitoring.

Thus, in December 1996, the first POAL campaign was carried out in the Antarctic. The preliminary data obtained will make it possible, in the short term and to the extent that further campaigns are carried out on the frozen continent, to establish an environmental baseline allowing for adequate and preventive implementation of the appropriate environmental measures in line with the framework of the recommendations established in the Madrid Protocol.

Similarly, it will allow the impact of the facilities of other countries present on the continent to be determined.
CONCLUSION

Implementation of the Antarctic POAL is in accordance with the purposes and
objectives of Chilean Antarctic Policy and its corresponding National Antarctic
Plan as well as General Law No. 19.300 on Environmental Principles and the
relevant International Agreements which have been ratified by Chile.

RECOMMENDATION

Encourage the member countries of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol to
undertake plans and programmes to cover the environmental issues mentioned in
the appendices of the Madrid Protocol in such a way that, with a combined effort,
adequate measures are adopted to maintain and protect the Antarctic
environment, thus bringing the countries into the Protocol's regulatory
framework.
