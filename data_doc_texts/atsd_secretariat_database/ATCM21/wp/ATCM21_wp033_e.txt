AMENDMENT OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE
(Netherlands Working Paper)

As a spin-off from the work undertaken by the Netherlands in considering the nature and 0
the relevance of Recommendations adopted by ATCMs I to XVIII (inclusive), it became
clear that in some cases the text of Recommendations is not in agreement with the English
version of the Rules of Procedure (1992, pages 280-4 of the ATS Handbook of 1994).
The cases concerned are reflected in notes to Recommendations 12:06 and 13:02 found on
pages 91 and 92 of the Final Report of ATCM XX.

Rule 25 (position of non-Consultative Parties)

This Rule says that the Final Report "shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Meeting
to all Governments of all Consultative Parties which have been invited to take part in the
Meeting, for their consideration." This is not in accordance with Recommendation 12:06
and with actual practice, both of which include non-Consultative Parties.
As New Zealand has identified this as one of the errors it proposes to correct in ATCM
XXI/WP 1, it need not further be dealt with here.

Rules 2,3,30 (position of COMNAP)

The Final Report of ATCM XVI, paragraph 24, last sentence reads:
"It was agreed that COMNAP should be invited in future to participate on the same basis
as SCAR under Recommendation XIII-2."
This is reaffirmed in the Final Report of ATCM XVII, paragraph 25:
"The Meeting reaffirmed the value of reports to ATCMs by COMNAP on its activities.
The Meeting further endorsed full and continuing participation by COMNAP at future
ATCMs to provide advice and assistance on issues relating to Antarctic operations."

However, COMNAP is not mentioned in the Rules of Procedure at all. Clearly,
COMNAP is not a Party to the Antarctic Treaty. It is not an Observer either, as Rule 2
lists only two Observers (the CCAMLR Commission and SCAR), nor is COMNAP
invited as an Expert under Rules 38-41. According to the Rules of Procedure, COMNAP
simply does not exist, which would certainly preclude its attending ATCMs in any
capacity. It is therefore proposed to amend the Rules of Procedure as follows:

Rule 2
Present text:
"The Representatives of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research invited to attend those
Meetings in accordance with Rule 30, shall be referred to as 'observers'.

Proposed new text:
"The Representatives of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and the Council of Managers
of National Antarctic Programs, invited to attend those Meetings in accordance with Rule
30, shall be referred to as 'observers'.

Rule 3, third sentence

Present text:
"The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research shall be represented by the Chairman and
President respectively or by other persons appointed to this end."

Proposed new text:
"The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and the Council of Managers of National
Antarctic Programs shall be represented by the Chairman or President, as applicable, or
by other persons appointed to this end."

Rule 30

Present text:
"The observers referred to in Rule 2 shall attend the Meetings for the specific purpose of
reporting on:"

a.  In the case of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
    Resources, developments in its area of competence.

b.  In the case of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research:
    i.  the general proceedings of SCAR;
    ii. matters within the competence of SCAR under the Convention for the
        Conservation of Antarctic Seals;
    iii. such publications and reports as many have been published or prepared in
         accordance with Recommendations IX-19 and VI-9 respectively.

Proposed new text:
Add subparagraph c reading:
"c.  in the case of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs, the
    activities within its Terms of Reference."
