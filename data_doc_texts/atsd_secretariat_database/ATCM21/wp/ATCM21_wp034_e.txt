REPORT ON INTERSESSIONAL WORK

Agenda Item 6 b

Submitted by New Zealand

1. At XX ATCM New Zealand offered to coordinate intersessional work on the basis of its Information Paper (XX ATCM/INF 2) on developing further understanding of the terms "minor" and "transitory" and enhancing mutual understanding of EIA processes. New Zealand undertook to report to XXI ATCM on these issues.

2. New Zealand advised Parties that it had appointed a coordinator for the intersessional work, and provided mail, facsimile and email addresses for communication with New Zealand on the intersessional work by diplomatic note in September 1996. A number of Parties notified New Zealand of particular experts who would be contact points for the work. Several of these experts provided New Zealand with thoughts and suggestions for the direction of the work.

3. Two New Zealand Discussion Papers were circulated to Parties via diplomatic channels and to experts via the Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON) in March 1997. Responses to those papers were received during April and May 1997.

4. Following the tabling by the United Kingdom of its listing of known EIAs undertaken for proposed activities in Antarctica (XX ATCM/INF 8), New Zealand also offered to coordinate further work on this and to report to XXI ATCM.

5. Consequently, New Zealand has proceeded on three items of intersessional work since XX ATCM: (i) the terms "minor" and "transitory", (ii) understanding of EIA processes, and (iii) a summary listing of EIAs, audits/reviews and related documents.

6. The work on further understanding of the terms "minor" and "transitory" is reported as XXI ATCM/WP 35, tabled by New Zealand; the work on understanding of EIA processes is reported as XXI ATCM/WP 36, tabled by New Zealand; and the listing of EIAs, audits/reviews and related documents is tabled as XXI ATCM/INF 37 by the Secretariat.

7. New Zealand is grateful for the cooperative spirit in which Parties engaged themselves for this intersessional work, and is particularly indebted to those individuals who took the time to provide ideas, and to challenge other ideas in a constructive manner. From the responses received, the process has been viewed as positive by the majority of Parties. New Zealand has certainly benefitted from a greater understanding of others' interpretation of terms, and others' experience of interpreting the new obligations of the Protocol. Given our common need to respond to these new challenges, New Zealand believes that these first steps have been valuable, 
1
and that the process of consultation intersessionally could be used as a means to progress other 
Protocol implementation discussions.

8. Accordingly, New Zealand believes it would be useful to continue with intersessional 
exchanges on issues of common interest. On the basis of responses during the present work, 
New Zealand feels that further focus on EIA processes may be helpful.
