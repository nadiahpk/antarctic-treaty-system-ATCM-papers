HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS
(submitted by New Zealand)

(Agenda Item 6 f)

The Antarctic Treaty Parties have long recognised the importance of historic sites and monuments in Antarctica. The need to take steps to protect these sites was apparent at the first ATCM where Parties agreed the "all adequate measures to protect such tombs, buildings or objects of historic interest, from damage and destruction" would be taken (Recommendation I-IX). Subsequent recommendations endorsed this view and resulted in the adoption by Parties of a "List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the Proposing Government or Governments" (Recommendation VII-9).

2     The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty reinforced the concern of Parties for the preservation of historic sites and monuments. Annex V (Article 8) states that listed historic sites and monuments "shall not be damaged, removed or destroyed".

3     On 28 November 1979 257 people of several nationalities lost their lives when the aircraft in which they were travelling crashed into the slopes of Mount Erebus on Ross Island. In spite of the courageous and determined action of members of the New Zealand and United States Antarctic expeditions not all the bodies of those killed in the crash could be recovered. Parties adopted Recommendation XI-3 which agreed to declare the site on the slopes of Mount Erebus where the accident took place as a tomb to ensure that the area would be left in peace.

4     In late 1979 a six foot Oregon timber cross was erected close to the crash site (Recommendation XI-3 prohibits the erection of a permanent memorial at the actual site) as a memorial to those who lost their lives. After damage by wind this cross was replaced on 30 January 1987 with a cross of stainless steel. It is located on a rocky promontory overlooking the crash site, approximately three kilometres away. It is not part of any proposed protected area for this region.

5     In recognition of the commemorative and symbolic value of the memorial cross and in recognition also of Parties' responsibilities to protect historic monuments, the Government of New Zealand propose that the Mount Erebus Memorial Cross at Lewis Bay, Ross Island be listed as an Historic Monument.
