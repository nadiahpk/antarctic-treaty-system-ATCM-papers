In order to continue the work on an Annex on Liability to the Protocol, Germany submits 
the following proposal to the Consultative Meeting:

1.  The Consultative Meeting takes notice of the work of legal experts on liability as 
reported by the Chairman of the Group.

2.  The Consultative Meeting extends, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, the 
mandate of the Meeting of Legal Experts on Liability on the basis of the draft 
elaborated by Prof. Wolfrum (see Annex).

3.  The Consultative Meeting agrees to convene an intersessional meeting of legal 
experts before the XXIInd Consultative Meeting in Norway.

4.  The Consultative Meeting expresses its hope that as a result of these meetings of 
legal experts, a draft of an Annex on Liability can be presented to the XXIInd 
Consultative Meeting for further discussion.
