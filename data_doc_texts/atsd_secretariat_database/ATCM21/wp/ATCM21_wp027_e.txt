MONUMENT N° 41

PROPOSAL

The following text should be added to the final part of the paragraph:

"...and the rock cairn built by survivors of the wreck at the highest point of the island to draw the attention of rescue expeditions".

The complete new text would read as follows:

41. Stone hut on Paulet Island, built in February of 1903 by
C.A. Larsen, Norwegian captain of the wrecked vessel “Antarctic”,
of the Swedish South Polar Expedition lead by Otto Nordenskjöld.
together with the grave of a member of that expedition, and the
rock cairn, built by survivors of the wreck at the highest point of
the island to draw the attention of rescue expeditions. (Lat. 63°
35´ S - Long. 55° 47´ O).

BACKGROUND

The adventure that followed for the twenty survivors of the
“Antarctic” wreck on Paulet Island in 1903, is of sufficient notoriety
and has served as basis for the historic monument declaration of
the site. The “cairn”, the incorporation of which is being proposed,
was unknown at the time and was therefore not included in the list.
In January 1994 members of the working group of the I.A.A.
MUSEOANTAR´s programme for restoration of historic sites,
overflew the area and sighted the remains of the monument.
During the following 1995/96 campaign a study of the site was
undertaken. (“The rock “cairn” on Paulet Island. An unknown
archaeological monument”. I.A.A. Contribution N° 447. Buenos
Aires, 1996).
The historical value of the monument is evidence of the shipwreck survivor's hard work in order to carry large sized rocks from the lower parts of the island to the summit 351 metres above, and of the difficult circumstances which they lived. These facts are sufficient to prevent this 90 year old landmark from being forgotten, and are ample reason for it to be added to the other two landmarks in remembrance of captain Carl Anton Larsen and his men.

In his book "Viaje al Polo Sur (Voyage to the South Pole) (Vol. II, pág. 443 Casa Editorial Maucci, Barcelona, 1905) Doctor Nordenskjöld says:

"We got closer and closer, and with the telescope we soon distinguished the formidable rock sign which the survivors had built at the highest point so as to draw the attention of a rescue expedition"

It was November 1903, and the Swedish Expedition leader was approaching Paulet on board the "Uruguay" an argentine corvette which would rescue all the men that had been left to their luck after the sinking of the expeditionary vessel "Antarctic".
