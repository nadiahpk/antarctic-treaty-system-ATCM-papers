CONTA?INATION OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN
(Item 14 on the Agenda)
(Tabled by Chile)

Since the beginning of modern large-scale fishing operations in Southern Ocean 
waters, waste, particularly plastic materials, has been dumped into the sea there by vessels 
from fishing fleets. On the northern coastline of the South Shetland Islands it is possible to 
see orange-coloured buoys, other solid wastes and large amounts of rubbish.

Some of the synthetic fibres have already caused disturbances and damage to the 
fauna of Cape Shirreff on Livingston Island, for example, and it is a common occurrence 
to see fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) with plastic collars, or to find fibres used by 
seagulls (Larus dominicanus), Snowy Sheathbill (Chionis alba) and Chinstrap penguins 
(Pygoscelis antarctica) for nest-building.

These wastes constitute damage to the marine biota and run counter both to the 
recommendations of the CCAMLR and established environmental protection measures. 
Time and time again scientific reports have indicated that the accumulation of such waste 
on the beaches of the Sub-Antarctic islands and on the Antarctic Peninsula is continuing.

With the aim of giving support to such initiatives, we hereby propose the following

RECOMMENDATION

  • Considering that numerous international documents have been issued concerning the 
    protection of the marine environment,

  • Bearing in mind that the Antarctic Treaty System has specific legal documents concerning 
    the conservation of the Antarctic environment and its resources,

  • Recognising that nonetheless the contamination of the seas, particularly those of 
    ecosystems related to the Southern Ocean, is continuing, and

  • Recognising that many private activities involving the use and exploitation of marine 
    resources are operating both within and outside the Treaty area,

  • That there is an urgent need to propose and take action which will allow the present 
    situation to be minimised or reverted back to normal,
The Parties hereby recommend that:

1 2. To promote the development of information on the conservation of marine 
ecosystems for inclusion in educational study programmes, as well as in ships' crew 
training programmes generally and programmes for fishing and cruise ships crews in 
particular, in order to contribute to making people aware of the damage caused by 
throwing waste into the sea.

2 3. To establish a programme to monitor the results of such actions in order to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the measures adopted and thereby enable their maintenance or 
modification as the case may be.
