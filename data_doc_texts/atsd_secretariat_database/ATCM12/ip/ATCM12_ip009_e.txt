AGENDA ITEM NO. 7

(Facilitation of Scientific Research:
Sites of Special Scientific Interest - (SSSI))

(Submitted by Delegation of United Kingdom)

Attached is a copy of the Management Plan referred
to in discussion of this agenda item and approved by SCAR.

(Previously issued as document
ANT/XII/INF 5 during Preparatory Meeting)
SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
SOUTH BAY, DOUMER ISLAND
PALMER ARCHIPELAGO
MANAGEMENT PLAN

i)      Description of Site

The site consists of a small area of coastal and subtidal benthic down to 45m
depth as follows : L 64° 51' 42'' S. to the North, between G 63° 34' 00'' W
and G 63°35' 20'' W; and to the South by a diagonal line that starts at a 100
meters from the Refuge to G 63° 34' 00'' W. Boundaries are shown on the
attached map.

ii)     Reason for Designation

This site is subject of a long-term research programme on ecology and the purpo-
se of designating it is, as far as possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interfe-
rence which could jeopardize these scientific investigations.

iii)    Outline of Research

The study of the relationships among marine organisms started by scuba diving
in this area in 1972. Since 1981 advanced type experiments to understand
community structure and functioning are under way, and will continue in the
future. These require the avoidance, as much as possible, of artificial interference.

iv)     Date of expiry of designation

June 1988

v)      Access points

Access points as such are not applicable. Area is not affected by the passage of
boats.

vi)     Pedestrian and vehicular routes

Restricted

vii)    Other kinds of scientific investigations which would not cause harmful interfe-
rence.

Any scientific research that requires collection of organisms should be avoided.
Observations by scuba diving would not cause significant interference.

viii)   Scientific sampling

Collection of samples only for compelling scientific purposes

ix)     Other restraints

The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling should be avoided. An-
choring should be avoided unless under compelling circumstances.

Annex to Resolution 4 (EC-XXXIV)

MANUAL ON THE GLOBAL OBSERVING SYSTEM, VOLUME II - REGIONAL ASPECTS, ANTARCTIC

1.    Basic synoptic network of surface and upper-air observing stations in 
      the Antarctic

1.1   Composition of the basic synoptic network in the Antarctic

1.1.1 The basic synoptic network of surface and upper-air observing stations 
      in the Antarctic has been adopted by a resolution of the WMO Executive 
      Committee.

1.1.2 Manned surface stations included in the basic synoptic network in the 
      Antarctic should, to the extent practicable, conform to the specifications 
      laid down for principal land stations in Volume I of the Manual on the Global 
      Observing System.

1.2   Surface synoptic observations

      All surface stations included in the basic synoptic network in the 
      Antarctic should make surface synoptic observations at the four main standard 
      times of observation, i.e. 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT. Where possible when 
      other requirements make it desirable, observations should also be made at some 
      or all of the four intermediate standard times of observations, i.e. 0300, 
      0900, 1500, and 2100 GMT. The carrying out of the observations at the main 
      standard times of observation should be given first priority.

1.3   Upper-air synoptic observations

      All upper-air stations included in the basic synoptic network in the 
      Antarctic should make radiosonde and/or radiowind observations at 0000 and 
      1200 GMT. When other considerations permit, the stations that are unable to 
      carry out the full upper-air observing programme should give priority to the 
      carrying out of the observations at 0000 GMT. Stations which are separated by 
      no more than about 250 km may wish to consider bilateral arrangements whereby 
      each undertakes one of the ascents to complete between them the full observing 
      programme required.

1.4   Arrangements and procedures for updating and amending the basic 
      synoptic network in the Antarctic

      Certain minor changes in the basic synoptic network of surface and 
      upper-air observing stations in the Antarctic which do not affect the data 
      requirements for the Antarctic as a whole are inevitable from time to time. 
      To provide a simple and rapid means of effecting such changes proposed by the 
      Member concerned, the following procedure shall be followed:

(a)   The WMO Executive Committee authorizes the President of the 
      Organization to approve, at the request of the Member concerned
176                                  ANNEX XIII

and in consultation with the Secretary-General, minor changes to 
the basic synoptic network in the Antarctic as may be required.  
Any change of substance would still require a formal consulta-
tion between the WMO Members operating in the Antarctic;

(b)  The Secretary-General shall notify all Members of WMO by circular 
letter of changes agreed with the President of WMO.

2.      Network of stations preparing and issuing CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP 
        Reports

        The network of CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP reporting stations in the 
Antarctic has been adopted by a resolution of the Executive Committee.

3.      Weather reporting by traverse parties

        Members operating stations in the Antarctic are encouraged to instruct 
all traverse parties to make surface observations wherever circumstances 
permit when they are distant from their base by more than 200 km.  These 
observations which should be as close as possible to the standard times of 
observation should be transmitted at least once a day.

4.      Automatic weather stations in the Antarctic

        Members are encouraged to use automatic weather stations to complement 
the  basic  synoptic  network  of  stations,  taking  advantage  of  the 
data-collection capabilities of the near-polar-orbiting satellites and, for 
some of them, of the geostationary meteorological satellites.

5.      AIREP reports

        Members are encouraged to arrange for making, recording and distribut-
ing AIREP reports from all flights into and within the Antarctic.

MANUAL ON THE GLOBAL DATA-PROCESSING SYSTEM, VOLUME II - REGIONAL ASPECTS,
THE ANTARCTIC

Data-processing activities and meteorological services in the Antarctic
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.      Data-processing and meteorological service functions are proposed to
be carried out by the following stations in the Antarctic:

        Marambio
        Mawson*
        Molodeznaja
        Presidente Frei

2.      The functions proposed for stations in the Antarctic providing data-
processing and other meteorological services are:

        (a)     Preparation of meteorological analyses and prognoses for the
whole of the Antarctic or for defined sectors thereof, and making them promptly available to other stations inside or outside the Antarctic;

        (b)     Preparation of specialized meteorological forecasts for users
(marine and aviation interests, traverse parties, etc.), and making them promptly available to other stations inside or outside the Antarctic;

        (c)     Preparation and distribution of warnings of dangerous weather
conditions for the area for which the station prepares analyses, prognoses or specialized forecasts;

        (d)     Support for research activities as required.

NOTE:   It is recognized that the carrying out of these functions is subject to
seasonal variation between the Austral summer and winter.

3.      Criteria for inclusion of an Antarctic station in the list of stations
proposed in paragraph 1 are:

        (a)     That the station is willing to carry out the functions indicated
in paragraph 2 above to the maximum extent possible;

        (b)     That the station has, or will have in the near future, the
capability to carry out the functions adequately;

        (c)     That at least one other station inside or outside the Antarctic
requires the processed information available from the station;

*       Australia may replace Mawson by another Australian station in the future.
182                                  ANNEX XVI

(d) That the station should have adegute telecommunication 
      facilities to receive observational data and exchange and 
      distribute processed information with other stations as required.
