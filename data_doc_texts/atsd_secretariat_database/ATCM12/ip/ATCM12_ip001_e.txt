Departure from Australia

Delegates are strongly recommended to reconfirm their
homeward bookings several days before departure. This can be
done through diplomatic missions or the meeting secretariat.

An airport departure tax of $A20.00 is payable by all
outgoing passengers on international flights. Delegates
travelling on diplomatic passports may present their passport
and air ticket to the conference Secretariat, which will
arrange for a tax stamp exempting delegates from payment of the
departure tax.
