ITEM 13: EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION UNDER
THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

(Submitted by the United States)
PLAN FOR DATA RELEASE FOR CRUISE OF R/V LEE TO ANTARCTICA
JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1984

They system of data release described below applied to 
the U.S. Geological Survey geophysical data collection planned 
for the 1984 Antarctic Cruise and follows standard procedure for 
all U.S. Geological Survey data in the continental U.S..  The 
procedure is also consistent with the U.S. National Science 
Foundation policy for other data collected by the United States 
Antarctic Research Program.

1.  Prior to the cruise a map showing the proposed cruise 
track is available.  This track will of course be modified by 
weather, sea and ice conditions actually encountered.

2.  Subsequent to the cruise, maps showing the actual cruise 
track will be available.

3.  Processing of modern multichannel seismic reflection data 
in particular is expensive and time consuming.  Something of the 
order of one year is anticipated for processing of seismic 
record sections and the other geophysical data.  After 
preliminary data processing is completed record sections and 
other material will be available for inspection.

4.  After final processing, a report including copies of the 
data will be released.  The present schedule plans for 
completion two years after the cruise.

5.  Copies of record sections and magnetic tapes containing 
seismic and other data will be deposited in the U.S. National

1
Data Centre where copies will be freely available to anyone,
subject to payment of reasonable reproduction costs.

6.      The research scientists actually participating in the
cruise and interpreting the results will obviously have initial
access to the data and will prepare reports to be published in
scientific journals.  The schedule discussed above provides for
the protection of their interests and fulfills on a timely basis
the requirements of Article III, paragraph 1, subparagraph (c)
of the Antarctic Treaty.
