ITEM 7:  SITES OF SPECIAL INTEREST:

TELEGRAM FROM THE PRESIDENT OF SCAR

TO MR R. TUCKER SCULLY (CHIEF U.S. DELEGATE,
12TH ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING,
CANBERRA 12-27 SEPTEMBER 1983).
Mr R. Tucker Scully,
Chief U.S. Delegate,
12th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting,
Canberra,
AUSTRALIA.

The Conservation Subcommittee of the SCAR Working
Group on Biology at its meeting yesterday in Wilderness, South
Africa, considered the position of the sites of special scientific
interest whose designations will expire in 1983 and 1985.  It
recognises that proposals for extension of the expiry dates of
these sites will most appropriately be made by the groups which
originally proposed them. Within the knowledge of the Sub-
Committee it is the intention of the groups making use of these
areas that the designations should be extended.  The Sub-Committee
has therefore asked members to prepare proposals as appropriate to
present to XVIII SCAR and requests the Treaty to keep in force the
SSSI designations through the next Treaty Meeting at which time
SCAR will present results of its comprehensive review of all
SSSI's.

FROM:

James N. Zumberge,
President,
SCAR.
