GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE WORK OF THE MEETING

1.      ORGANIZATION OF THE MEETING (Agenda item 1)

1.1     Opening of the meeting (Agenda item 1.1)

1.1.1   The Meeting on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements 
was held from 20 to 22 June 1983 in the WMO headquarters building 
in Geneva, Switzerland.

1.1.2   The meeting was opened at 10 a.m. on 20 June 1983 by 
Dr. G.K. Weiss, Director of the World Weather Watch Department.  He 
welcomed all participants and conveyed the best wishes of the 
Secretary-General for a successful meeting.

1.1.3   Dr. Weiss mentioned that the Antarctic takes a special place 
in the organization of WMO, since it did not belong to one specific 
Regional Association and that, therefore, the Executive Council, at 
its last session, had decided to maintain its Working Group on 
Antarctic Meteorology.  He recalled the request of this working group 
to CBS and its relevant working group to consider the exchange of 
Antarctic data over the GTS, and to discuss what arrangements have to 
be made to ensure the reliable global distribution of Antarctic data.

1.1.4   Dr. Weiss recalled that the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting developed an Antarctic telecommunication network which will be 
reviewed at its forthcoming Twelfth Meeting, to ensure the timely and 
reliable collection and exchange of Antarctic data.  He felt, however, 
that, by organizing the present expert meeting in Geneva, this would 
be a good occasion to review the present arrangements and develop 
recommendations aiming at the improvement of the present situation.  
These recommendations will then be submitted to the Permanent 
Representatives concerned for consideration and possibly through them 
to the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

1.1.5   Dr. Weiss wished the meeting every success in the achievement 
of its goals and wished the participants a pleasant stay in Geneva.

1.2     Election of the chairman (Agenda item 1.2)

        Mr. J.R. Neilon (U.S.A.) was unanimously elected Chairman 
of the meeting.

1.3     Adoption of the agenda (Agenda item 1.3)

The provisional agenda submitted to the meeting was adopted 
without change and is reproduced at the beginning of the report.

1.4     Working arrangements (Agenda item 1.4)

1.4.1   Under this agenda item, the meeting decided upon its 
working hours.

1.4.2   Provision was made for whispered interpretation into Russian 
and Spanish and consecutive interpretation into English. Working 
documents, before and during the meeting, were made available in 
English, Russian and Spanish.

1.5     Attendance at the meeting

There were seven participants at the meeting, representing 
the centres which are the entry points on the GTS for injecting Antarctic 
data. A complete list of participants is given at the beginning 
of this report.

2.      REVIEW OF THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC 
DATA AND ENTRY POINTS TO THE GTS (Agenda item 2)

2.1     The meeting reviewed the existing situation as regards 
the daily international exchange of meteorological data within the 
Antarctic and also the principal routes by which Antarctic data leaves 
the Antarctic and enters the Global Telecommunication System (GTS). 
The considerations were based on three diagrams which were established 
as of September 1978 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.

2.2     The meeting noted additional information provided by the 
participating experts and, consequently, updated these diagrams and 
merged two diagrams dealing with the routeing of Antarctic data toward 
and into the GTS, in one diagram. The updated diagrams are given in 
the Annexes to this paragrapñ. (See Annexes I and II.)

2.3     The meeting also noted that, in accordance with a request 
of the tenth session of the CBS Working Group on the GTS, in addition 
to the usual annual global monitoring in October 1982, a specific survey 
was carried out from 7 to 11 March 1983. The aim of the last survey 
was to identify, if possible, where data might be lost during its 
transmission over the GTS. The meeting was informed that this last 
survey was not intended to specifically evaluate the exchange of 
Antarctic data, but all Antarctic data were automatically included in the 
statistics since it is global data to be exchanged on the GTS.
- 3 -

2.4     The meeting noted that some Antarctic data were received 
very irregularly at certain centres on the Main Telecommunication 
Network (MTN), for example, data from Block 85 rarely reached any 
centre, except Washington.  Furthermore, the availability of Antarctic 
data at Washington was higher than that at other centres.  At any rate, 
the meeting noted that the availability of Antarctic data on the Main 
Telecommunication Network (MTN) did not reach 80% of the total number 
of reports expected to be received.

2.5     In addition to monitoring results made available by the 
WMO Secretariat, the meeting also noted some monitoring results which 
were made available by some experts.  It noted that some Antarctic 
data were received with significant delays by the centres on the MTN, 
e.g. some SYNOP data were only received six hours, or more, after 
observation time.

2.6     The meeting expressed its concern about this situation and 
made an analysis of possible reasons for this situation.  It noted that 
the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology (Geneva, April 1982), 
when discussing the results of the monitoring of the flow of Antarctic 
data had concluded that:

    (i)     The amount of Antarctic data and its regular reception 
            varied substantially from station to station and 
            from centre to centre;

    (ii)    There were problems of propagation (aurora effects) 
            for short- and long-range communications;

    (iii)   Due to (ii) above, delays in the collection of 
            Antarctic data for several hours were quite frequent;

    (iv)    There is a problem concerning a sufficient number of 
            communications staff at some Antarctic stations to 
            assure a continuous 24-hour service;

    (v)     If the monitoring procedures as set forth in 
            Attachment I-5 of Volume I of the Manual on the GTS 
            on the flow of Antarctic data were implemented, a 
            considerable improvement in performance might be 
            expected.

It was understood that, due to the reasons mentioned under 
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above, SYNOP and TEMP messages were often 
accumulated at certain Antarctic stations, and could only be disseminated 
with considerable delay.
- 4 -

2.7      Furthermore, the meeting was informed that the Implementation 
Co-ordination Meeting on Upgrading of Operation of MTC and its branches 
(Geneva, 13-17 June 1983), when considering the results of the March 
1983 monitoring, noted possible reasons for losing reports or missing 
reports. These could be summarized as follows:

     (a) Some centres indicated that a certain number of reports 
received were not usable;  these data might be recorded 
as "not received" by downstream centres in some cases;

     (b) Bulletins incorrectly formatted might not be relayed 
from one centre to another;

     (c) Some centres might not recognize some bulletins or 
reports due to their excessive delay in reception;

     (d) Omission of report-separation-signal (=) might cause 
difficulty to separate individual reports in sequence;

     (e) Some bulletins contained different types of 
observational reports or reports made at different 
observation times.

2.8      The meeting discussed at some length possible measures to 
overcome the above-mentioned deficiencies, as regards the exchange 
on the GTS (see agenda item 3).

2.9      The meeting noted that the different stations in the 
Antarctic, in most cases, have been allocated station index numbers 
included in the block number of their originating national countries. 
It was felt that this method unnecessarily complicated the organization 
of the collection of Antarctic data and needed rationalization. 
It therefore invited the Secretary-General in co-ordination with Members 
concerned and with Presidents of Regional Associations, as appropriate, 
to consider that all stations south of 600 south should be allocated a 
station index number within block number 89.

CONCLUSION No. 1

2.10     The meeting noted that several Members are operating radio 
broadcasts in the Antarctic. The contents of these broadcasts not 
only serve possible users outside the Antarctic, but are in particular 
made to provide centres within the Antarctic with the necessary 
information, to prepare their analyses, warnings and forecasts. Some 
experts indicated that it was sometimes difficult for broadcast centres 
in the Antarctic to transmit the required information since in many 
cases there was not the necessary feedback of observational data from 
other parts of the Antarctic.
- 5 -

2.11     As regards broadcasts and/or transmissions made by Members outside the Antarctic and intended for interception in the Antarctic,
the meeting was informed that these broadcasts did not always contain sufficient data, in particular upper-air data  was frequently missing or
inadequate.

2.12     The meeting stressed the importance of these broadcasts,
within and outside the Antarctic, for the day-to-day operation of the
different centres in the Antarctic to meet their obligations.  It therefore
made a plea to Members concerned to ensure that all the observational
data required by the Antarctic centres be included in the radio
broadcasts and transmissions they originate and which are directed towards
the Antarctic.

                        CONCLUSION No. 2

2.13     The possible use of satellite circuits between the different
collecting centres and the entry points on the GTS was considered
for improving the exchange of meteorological information.  The expert
nominated by Argentina informed the meeting that plans exist to
implement in the second half of 1983 a satellite circuit (50 bauds)
between Buenos Aires and Marambio.  The expert nominated by the
U.S.S.R. informed the meeting that, although the daily operation
between Moscow and Molodezhnaya is being made through HF radio operation,
arrangements have been made for the lease of a satellite circuit on
INMARSAT to be used as back-up channel in cases of outages.

2.14     In this connexion, the meeting was informed by the
expert nominated by Chile about the experience gained by his Service
in operating four automatic weather stations (DCPs).  The technical
results were not very satisfactory because the sensors which were used
on the equipment did not resist the extreme weather conditions prev?iling
in the Antarctic.  Problems occurred in the power supply for the operation
of the stations and, because of this, some discrepancies were observed
in comparison with observations made by manned stations.  His Service,
however, was taking remedial measures to improve the reliability of the
operation of these stations.

2.15     The expert nominated by the U.K. informed the meeting that
the U.K. has been operating DCPs as a means of transmitting complete
bulletins to the GTS.  Two operational DCPs are at Halley (89022) and
Faraday (88952), and currently 90% of their data is reaching the GTS.
Further information on this matter is contained in the Annex to this
paragraph (see Annex III).
- 6 -

2.16     The meeting recommended that Members concerned should consider 
the increased use of satellite communications and Data Collection 
Platforms (DCPs) operating through satellite communication links. 
This mode of operation gives significant advantages over HF radio because 
of the improved reliability, reduced manpower and guaranteed timely 
transmission.

         CONCLUSION No. 3

3.       EXCHANGE OF ANTARCTIC DATA ON THE GTS (Agenda item 3)

3.1      The meeting was informed that CBS-VIII considered a 
request of the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology to inject 
delayed Antarctic observational data into the GTS. It was further 
informed that CBS-VIII, in view of the importance of this information, 
agreed that delayed Antarctic observational data should be exchanged 
over the GTS up to 24 hours after the time of observation. It noted 
that an appropriate text was proposed for insertion in the Manual on 
the GTS.

3.2      The meeting also noted that the Implementation Co-ordination 
Meeting on Upgrading of MTC and its branches (Geneva, 13-17 June 1983) 
considered and made proposals in this respect, which were submitted 
to the present meeting for further consideration.

3.3      After discussion of the different proposals, the meeting 
felt that no changes or additions should be made to the established 
WMO telecommunication procedures. It realized, however, that certain 
adjustments in the present dissemination of Antarctic data were required.

3.4      The meeting, in view of the above, was of the opinion that 
the entry point (centre) on the GTS should be responsible for the proper 
compiling and formatting of the relevant Antarctic bulletins, in accordance 
with established WMO telecommunication procedures.

         CONCLUSION No. 4

3.5      The meeting agreed that it would be necessary for Members 
concerned to inject on the GTS only data from those stations they 
are collecting, and submit this information for inclusion in the WMO 
Catalogue of Meteorological Bulletins. The meeting invited the 
Secretary-General to request Members concerned to send the information 
requested to the Secretariat, if possible, prior to the forthcoming 
Twelfth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting for inclusion in the 
relevant WMO Publications.

         CONCLUSION No. 5

3.6      In applying the relevant WMO telecommunication procedures, 
Members concerned should be urged to adhere strictly to the procedures 
for the use of "NIL" and "RTD" as prescribed in the Manual on the GTS, 
Volume I, PART II, paragraphs 2.3.2.2 and 2.3.3.7.

         CONCLUSION No. 6
- 7 -

3.7     The meeting also invited Members concerned to carry out some 
careful checking of the contents of their switching directories to ensure 
that Antarctic data bulletins are correctly handled.

                                  CONCLUSION No. 7

3.8     Furthermore, taking into account the monitoring results which 
were made available to the meeting and the proposed measures for 
improvement of the exchange of observational Antarctic data on the GTS, 
the meeting was of the opinion that the early introduction of real-time 
monitoring at all the stations concerned was of utmost importance. 
It therefore appealed to all Members concerned with the collection and 
dissemination of Antarctic observational data to implement real-time 
monitoring at their respective centres, in conformity with the provisions 
included in the Manual on the GTS, Volume I, Attachment I-5, Table C.

                                  CONCLUSION No. 8

3.9     The meeting was presented with the results of an inquiry 
which was carried out at the request of the Tenth Consultative Meeting on 
the Antarctic Treaty (Washington, 1979) and the third session of the 
EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology, for updating the requirements 
for observational data and processed information to be exchanged within 
the Antarctic and centres outside the Antarctic.

3.10    The meeting noted these requirements and felt that the 
question of requirements was outside its terms of reference, and 
therefore it was agreed not to update the contents of the tables 
containing the requirements.

3.11    It was mentioned, however, that the centres Brockton, Byrd, 
Mallett and Stanley were no longer operational and should, therefore, 
be deleted from this table.

3.12    The meeting was of the opinion that this table, once updated, 
was of interest for telecommunication operations for performing their 
duties.  It therefore invited the Secretary-General to arrange that 
this table be updated and that its consolidated contents be published 
in a simplified way, for use by telecommunication centres.  A proposal 
was made to this effect and the format for the simplified presentation 
is given in the Annex to this paragraph.  (See Annex IV.)

                                  CONCLUSION No. 9

3.13    The meeting requested the Secretary-General to refer the 
above matter to the Chairman of the EC Working Group on Antarctic 
Meteorology.

                                  CONCLUSION No. 10
- 8 -

Urgent action in view of the forthcoming Twelfth 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting

3.14     The meeting was informed that the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting will be held in Australia in September/October 1983. 
It was felt that some of the conclusions reached at this meeting need 
endorsement by the Permanent Representative of the Members which are 
parties to the Antarctic Treaty, in particular those contained in 
Annexes I and II.

3.15     The meeting therefore requested the Secretary-General to 
bring the conclusions of this meeting to the attention of the Permanent 
Representatives concerned, as well as the Chairman of the EC Working 
Group on Antarctic Meteorology.

                                            CONCLUSION No. 11

3.16     Finally, the meeting requested the Secretary-General to 
include the relevant material in the appropriate WMO Publications 
after the approval by the appropriate bodies.

                                            CONCLUSION No. 12

ANNEX III

Annex to paragraph 2.15 of the general summary

DCPs operated by the United Kingdom in the Antarctic
---------------------------------------------------

1.      Halley is linked to Offenbach via METEOSAT I which is 
currently at 12° E. The elevation of METEOSAT I above the horizon 
is only 2° and the decision to install a DCP.was a calculated risk 
based on a ship trial. These showed that with a clear sea path there 
would be good reception down to sea level and sometimes at negative 
elevation due to refraction. The mountains of the Antarctic peninsula 
block the line of site between Faraday and METEOSAT I. Consequently, 
the Faraday DCP feeds into Washington via GOES-E. The elevation of 
GOES from Faraday is 16°.

2.      The DCP operating system consists of a Video Display 
Unit (VDU) editing terminal with full keyboard (Alphabet No. 5) and a 
two-page memory. The VDU is linked via the print key operation to the 
DCP and at the same time to a compatible dot matrix printer. The 
meteorological observer enters the data and edits each or several 
observations into WMO bulletin format. The actual DCP is pre-programmed 
to transmit for one minute every hour or every three hours, as formally 
agreed between the U.K. and the satellite operating agency (ESA for 
METEOSAT, NOAA for GOES-E). The formatted bulletin is sent to the 
DCP by pressing the appropriate key. There, it is held in store until 
the pre-set transmission time. No other action is needed. The 
transmission is at 100-baud rate but some of this is used for pre-set 
satellite address codes. There are about 640 character spaces 
available to the operator.

3.      The Halley DCP was installed in January 1982 and data was 
soon available on the GTS. There was an immediate improvement to 60% 
data reception at Bracknell (from 25%). There has been a gradual 
improvement and the current reception level is 90%. Data for 89002 
and 89022 are carried. The data are compiled by the European Space 
Agency under EESA heading and are inserted into the GTS at Offenbach. 
The Faraday DCP was installed in February 1983. There were some initial 
problems caused by an error in the DCP software but this was corrected 
in April 1983. The current data reception is 90% to 100% at Bracknell 
via Washington. The Faraday bulletins are compiled under its own 
location indicator STAF. The overall advantages are:

    (i)     Low capital cost - typically £5,000 per set without 
spares;

    (ii)    High reliability;

    (iii)   Freedom from radio interference and fading;

    (iv)    Saving in manpower - a specialist radio-operator is 
not needed;

    (v)     Immediate transmission complying with the GTS time limits.
