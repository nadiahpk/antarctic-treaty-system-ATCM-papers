AGENDA ITEM 7: SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

(Revised Recommendation and draft paragraphs for inclusion in
the Final Report submitted by the Delegations of Chile
United Kingdom and Argentina)
Draft Recommendation

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST - INTERIM GUIDELINES

The Representatives,

Recalling Article VI of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations VII-3, VIII-3 and VIII-4;

Affirming that no Site of Special Scientific Interest shall be designated in the marine environment other than in accordance with the requirements of Recommendation VIII-3 and that no part of the management plan for any such site may prejudice the passage of vessels into, in or through the Site;

Noting that a management plan has been prepared for a Site of Special Scientific Interest in part of South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago and that the management plan has been accepted by SCAR;

Considering that it would be advantageous to gather experience of the practical effect of the management plan prepared for this Site;

Recommend to their Governments that they voluntarily take account of the management plan, annexed to this recommendation, for Site No. 9 in part of South Bay, Doumer Island.

MANAGEMENT_PLAN

(i)     Description_of_Site

The site consists of a small area of coastal and subtidal benthos down to 45m depth as follows: Latitude 64° 51' 42" S. to the North, between Longitudes 63° 34' 00" W and 63° 35' 20" W; and to the South by a diagonal line that starts at a point 100 meters north of the Refuge on the southern shore of South Bay to 64° 51' 58" S, 63° 34' 00" W.  Boundaries are shown on the attached map.

(ii)    Reason_for_Designation

This site is subject of a long-term research programme on ecology and the purpose of designating it is, as far as possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interference which could jeopardize these scientific investigations.

(iii)   Outline_of_Research

The study of the relationships among marine organisms started by scuba diving in this area in 1972.  Since 1981 advanced type experiments to understand community structure and functioning are under way, and will continue in the future.

2
These require the avoidance, as much as possible, of artificial 
interference.

(iv)  Date_of_expiry_of_designation

      June 1988

(v)   Access_points

      There is no restriction on the passage of vessels into,
in and through the Site.

(vi)  Pedestrian_and_vehicular_routes

      Pedestrians and vehicles should, as far as is feasible,
keep out of the Site.

(vii) Other_kinds_of_scientific_investigations_which_would_not_
--------------------------------------------------------

      Any scientific research that requires collection of 
organisms should be avoided.  Observations by scuba diving would 
not cause significant interference.

(viii) Scientific_sampling

      Collection of samples only for compelling scientific 
purposes.

3
(ix) Other_restraints

The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling should be avoided. Anchoring should be avoided unless under compelling circumstances.

Draft Paragraphs for Inclusion in the Final Report

7.       SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

A draft recommendation seeking the designation of a Site 
of Special Scientific Interest in part of South Bay, Doumer 
Island, Palmer Archipelago was tabled by the delegations of 
Chile, Argentina and the United Kingdom.  The proposal by 
Chilean scientists to designate this Site and the required 
management plan had been previously approved by the SCAR Working 
Groups on Biology and Logistics and by SCAR at its XVIIth 
Meeting.

It was agreed that Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
may only be designated in the marine environment if fully in 
accord with Recommendation VIII-3, especially operative 
paragraphs 1(a) (i) and (ii) of that Recommendation and if no 
restriction is placed on the passage of vessels into, in or 
through the Site.

It was further agreed that, through national Antarctic 
Committees, the attention of SCAR should be drawn to the 
previous paragraph of this Report.
