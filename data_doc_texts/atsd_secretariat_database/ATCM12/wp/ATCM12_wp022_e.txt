ITEM 5: DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON THE COLLECTION AND  
DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA  

(Prepared by the Telecommunications Working Group)
THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC
METEOROLOGICAL DATA

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation VI-3 and X-3;

Noting Resolutions 4,5,6,7 and 8 of the WMO Executive Committee,
Thirty Fourth Session, June 1982, concerning meteorological
observing networks, collection and transmission of
meteorological data and meteorological data processing in
Antarctica;

Recognising

(1)     the continuing importance of Antarctic meteorological
data for support of operations within Antarctica and for
weather forecasting and research, especially climate
research in the rest of the world;

(2)     the need to maintain a basic network of meteorological
stations providing surface and upper-air synoptic data to
meet in so far as possible the requirements of
Consultative Parties and of the WMO World Weather Watch;

(3)     the diminished value of meteorological data if it is not
available to users within and outside the Antarctic in
accordance with the WMO schedules for the receipt of raw
and processed data;

1
(4)     the paucity of Antarctic meteorological surface and upper 
air data and the consequent importance of maintaining 
regularity of meteorological observations;

(5)     that the increasing shipping and aircraft activities in 
Antarctica will give rise to increasing demands for 
meteorological support;

Reaffirming  the importance of the WMO Global Telecommunications 
System (GTS) for purposes of transmitting Antarctic 
meteorological data between Antarctic stations in cases where 
direct transmission within Antarctica is inhibited by 
ionospheric conditions,  and noting that the adoption by some 
Consultative Parties of satellite communications may facilitate 
the reception within Antarctica of meteorological data from the 
GTS;

Noting  

(1)     that monitoring carried out by WMO in 1982 and 1983 on 
the flow of Antarctic meteorological data into the GTS 
indicates that significant deficiencies remain;

(2)     the reactivation of the WMO Executive Committee Working 
Group on Antarctic Meteorology and the outcome of its 
Third Session in April 1982, including preliminary work 
on a review of the requirements for raw and processed 
data set out in Annexes 1 and 2 of Recommendation VI-3;

(3)     the efforts of the WMO Meeting of Experts on Antarctic 
Data Telecommunication Arrangements in June 1983, in 

 
2
reviewing and updating the meteorological
telecommunications routing diagrams set forth in Annexes
1, 2 and 3 of Recommendation X-3;

(4) that the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts arrived at a
number of conclusions and recommendations aimed at
improving Antarctic telecommunications for meteorological
purposes, and at improving the manner in which Antarctic
meteorological data is transmitted within the GTS of the
WMO World Weather Watch;

Recognising the need to keep under review:

(1)     the requirements for raw and processed Antarctic
meteorological data;

(2)     the arrangements for transmission of meteorological data
within Antarctica and between Antarctica and the WMO
World Weather Watch system;

Recommend to their Governments that:

          and

(1)     They use their best endeavours, subject to overriding
scientific, administrative or budgetary considerations,
to secure full implementation of the network of stations
and observational programs set forth in Annex 1 of this
Recommendation;

(2)     They maintain and improve, subject to overriding
scientific, administrative or budgetary considerations,
the system for collection and distribution of
meteorological data

3
to, from and within Antarctica having regard to the routing arrangements shown in Annexes 2 and 3, which are based on the conclusions of the WMO Meeting of Experts on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements in June 1983;

(3) They seek, through their Permanent Representatives with WMO, the completion of Annex IV to the Final Report of the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts, as a helpful contribution to planning the exchange of available meteorological data;

(4) They seek, through their Permanent Representatives with WMO, to ensure that consideration is given, as appropriate, to other conclusions and recommendations made by the aforesaid WMO Meeting of Experts;

(5) They invite WMO through their Permanent Representatives with that Organisation, to keep under review the arrangements for routing of meteorological data within Antarctica and between Antarctica and the GTS of the World Weather Watch, and to suggest actions which might be taken to improve the timely receipt of data at staticns in Antarctica and at World Meteorological Centres Melbourne, Moscow and Washington and other centres in the World Weather Watch System, having particular regard to changing requirements for meteorological information and to opportunities offered by new technology;

4
(6)   They note that the statements of requirements for raw and 
processed Antarctic meteorological data provided by the 
WMO pursuant to Recommendation X-3 paragraph 9 require 
refinement, and invite WMO, through their Permanent 
Representatives with that Organization, to undertake such 
refinement.
