ITEM FIVE - TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND METEOROLOGY
(Draft recommendation submitted by Australia)
The Representatives;

Recalling Recommendation X-3;

Taking account of the importance of Antarctic meteorological data to the World Weather Watch and the diminished value of such data if it is not available to users within and outside the Antarctic in accordance with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) schedules for the receipt of raw and processed data;

Being aware of the problems leading to the non-arrival of meteorological data on the GTS from time to time;

Noting, with appreciation, the efforts of the WMO Executive Committee Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology and the WMO Meeting on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements toward improving the availability of Antarctic meteorological data;

Recommend to their Governments that they:

1.      note the updated diagrams of meteorological data flow within and from the Antarctic prepared by the WMO Meeting on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements (see Annexes 1 and 2);

2.      note the following conclusions of the WMO Meeting on Antarctic Data Telecommunication Arrangements:

         the entry point (centre) on the GTS should be responsible for the proper compiling and formatting of the relevant Antarctic Bulletins, in accordance with established WMO telecommunication procedures;

1
.       nations inject on the GTS only data from those 
stations they are collecting, and submit the names of the 
stations for inclusion in the WMO Catalogue of 
Meteorological Bulletins;

.       in applying the relevant WMO telecommunication 
procedures WMO members should be urged to adhere strictly 
to the procedures for the use of "NIL" and "RTD" as 
prescribed in the Manual on the GTS, Volume I, Part II, 
paragraphs 2.3.2.2 and 2.3.3.7;

.       WMO members should carry out careful checking of the 
contents of their switching directories to ensure that 
Antarctic data bulletins are correctly handled;

.       all WMO members concerned with the collection and 
dissemination of Antarctic observational data are 
requested to implement real-time monitoring of their 
respective centres, in conformity with the provisions 
included in the Manual on the GTS, Volume I, Attachment 
I-5, Table C.
