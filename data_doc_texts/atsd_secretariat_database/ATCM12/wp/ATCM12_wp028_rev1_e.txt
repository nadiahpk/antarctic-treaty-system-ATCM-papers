Recognising that the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research

Antarctic scientific fields;

Noting_with_appreciation the advice provided to the Antarctic 
Treaty Consultative Parties by SCAR in response to various

"furthering the co-ordination of scientific activity in

circumpolar scope and significance";

Being_aware_also that the assistance requested of SCAR by the 
Consultative Parties imposes additional demands on scarce 
resources;

Recommend to their Governments:

    That they consider in the light of its expertise and past 
assistance any requests that may be made by their national 
committees for additional funding to meet costs to SCAR of 
responding to requests for advice by the Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Parties.
