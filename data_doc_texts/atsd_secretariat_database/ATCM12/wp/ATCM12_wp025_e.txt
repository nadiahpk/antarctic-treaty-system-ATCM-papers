ITEM_6:__DRAFT_RECOMMENDATION_ON_MAN'S_IMPACT
ON_THE_ANTARCTIC_ENVIRONMENT_(CODE_OF_CONDUCT)
(Submitted by the Environment Working Group)
MAN'S IMPACT ON THE
ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation VIII-11;

Noting a general increase in awareness amongst Consultative
Parties of the potential environmental impacts of the disposal
of waste in the Antarctic region;

Noting that the increasing level and degree of complexity of
Antarctic operations is likely to introduce into the Antarctic a
wider range of potentially environmentally damaging substances
than previously;

Noting that improvements in logistics and technology increase
the feasibility of on-site treatment of human and other waste,
and of the removal of solid waste, residues and noxious
substances from the Treaty area;

Recommend to their Governments that they seek the advice of
their respective Antarctic operating agencies as to:

1
(i)     any problems which have been experienced in implementing 
        the Code of Conduct for Antarctic Expeditions and Station 
        Activities contained in the Annex to Recommendation 
        VIII-11;  and

(ii)    the desirability and feasibility of revising the Code of 
        Conduct in the light of the points noted above, 
        particularly the increased potential for on-site 
        treatment and removal of waste from the Treaty area.
