AGENDA ITEM 6: MAN'S IMPACT ON THE
ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

(Draft recommendation submitted by Australia)
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION (Submitted by Australia) - MANS'S IMPACT ON
THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT (Item 6)

The Representatives,

Recalling  Recommendation VIII-11;

Desiring  to draw attention to the potential environmental
impacts of Antarctic expeditions and station activities;

Noting  a general increase amongst ATCPs in awareness of the
potential impacts of waste disposal in the Antarctic region;

Recommend  to their Governments that to the greatest extent
feasible they observe the code of conduct annexed to this
Recommendation at their stations and for their activities in the
Antarctic Treaty Area.

1.
CODE OF CONDUCT FOR ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONS AND STATION ACTIVITIES
(Item 6)
(Submitted by Australia)
(Suggested changes are underlined)

1. Waste_Disposal

The following are recommended procedures:

(a) Solid_Waste (*Note: reference to batteries has been 
deleted)

    (i)     Non-combustible, including chemicals.

These materials should_be_returned_to_the_
operator's_country_to_the_greatest_extent_possible.--
Alternatively_those_containing_non-harmful_chemicals may 
be disposed either at sea either in deep water or, if this is 
not possible, at specified sites in shallow water.

   (ii)    Combustibles

        -   Wood, wood products and paper should be 
incinerated, the ash being returned_to_the 
extent_possible_to_the_operator's_home_country.
Alternatively_the_ash_should_be disposed of at 
sea;

        -   Lubricating oils may be burnt, except those 
containing harmful additives which should be 
removed from the Treaty Area;

2.
- Carcasses and materials associated with 
imported experimental animals should be 
incinerated;

- All plastics and rubber products should be 
removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area.

(b) Liquid Waste

    (i) Human waste, garbage and laundry effluents should 
receive the highest degree of treatment practicable, with 
maceration and flushing into the sea as a desirable 
minimum.

    (ii) Large quantities of photographic liquids should 
be treated for the recovery of silver and the residue 
should be flushed into the sea.

(c) The above procedures are recommended for coastal 
stations. Field sites supported from coastal stations 
should, where feasible, use the facilities of their 
supporting station. Inland stations should concentrate all 
waste in deep pits. Except as stated for inland stations, 
waste should not be buried.

(d) Waste containing radio-isotopes should be removed from 
the Antarctic Treaty Area.

(e) Every effort should be made to reduce the plastic 
packaging of products imported into the Antarctic Treaty 
Area.

3.
(f) If possible the use of leaded fuels or fuels containing 
ethylene bromide and ethylene chloride should be avoided.

(g) When incinerators are used it is desirable to monitor the 
effluents.

2. Introduction_of_alien_species

Procedures to safeguard against the introduction of azlien 
species are covered by Article IX of the Agreed Measures for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

3. Disturbance_of_breeding_colonies_and_concentration_of_birds 
and_mammals

Procedures to minimise such disturbances are covered by 
Article VII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

4. Guidelines_for_Antarctic_operating_organizations_planning 
major_Antarctic_Projects

(a) In the planning of major operations in the Antarctic 
Treaty Area an evaluation of the environmental impact of the 
proposed activity should be carried out by the Antarctic 
operating organisations concerned. Such an evaluation should 
include:

    (i)     A description of the proposed action and an 
assessment of its potential benefits and its possible 
impact on the relevant ecosystems.

4.
(ii)     A consideration of alternative actions which 
might alter the pattern of benefits versus adverse 
environmental effects expected to result from the action.

(b) These evaluations may be circulated for information 
through SCAR channels to all the states engaged in Antarctic 
activities.
