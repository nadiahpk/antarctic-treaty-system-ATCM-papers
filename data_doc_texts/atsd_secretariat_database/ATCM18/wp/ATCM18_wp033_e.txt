PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING THE SYSTEM FOR
ANTARCTIC TREATY INSPECTIONS

Item 9 (a)
(Submitted by the United Kingdom)


dhe/341.1
Inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty
[submitted by the United Kingdom]

The Inspection provisions of Article VII of the Antarctic
Treaty have been regarded as an important means of ensuring
transparency of operations in Antarctica between Contracting
Parties. This point was reiterated at the XVII Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting (Venice, November 1992) when the
Parties emphasised the importance of inspections under
Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty as a means of monitoring
activities and exchanging information.  The meeting stressed
the need to enhance the quality of inspections, noting the
value of increased logistical co-operation.

While inspections have increased in frequency in recent
years, they continue to take place in a somewhat ad hoc
fashion.  Reports on inspections are moreover not necessarily
widely circulated, which reduces their value in disseminating
information.  Some have not been distributed at all, while
others are unobtainable.  The Paper submitted by the United
Kingdom to the XVIth ATCM [Bonn, October 1991: XVI ATCM/
INFO.5] noted this and recommended that all reports be
published as a matter of some urgency.  There appears,
however, to have been little progress in this respect.

A list of inspections carried out so far has been compiled
[Annex A].  From this it can be seen that the inspection
effort has been concentrated on stations in the Antarctic
Peninsula Area, due presumably to its relative ease of access
and dense concentration of stations.  Conversely other
stations, in more inaccessible areas, have been inspected
less frequently, if at all.  In the last three seasons, for
example, despite the considerable increase in the number of
Inspections less than 10% have taken place outside the
Antarctic Peninsula Area, and inspections outside the

dhe/341.2                                     /Peninsula
Peninsula have been relatively infrequent since inspections 
began in 1963. There is no apparent pattern in the frequency 
with which stations are inspected. [Annex B].

To date relatively few Treaty Parties have provided observers 
for inspections. Only 13 Treaty Parties have done so, with 
six participating in only one inspection. [Annex C].  This 
is not surprising, for the reports of both the last two ATCMs 
have drawn attention to the high cost of conducting 
inspections.

The XVI ATCM also highlighted the need for increased 
efficiency of inspections. With this in mind it could be 
questioned whether the existing ad hoc system is achieving 
the optimum result. Some stations have, for example, been 
"under-inspected"; while others have been "over-inspected"; 
even being inspected in two consecutive seasons. A few 
stations have not been inspected at all. There is at present 
no guarantee that the less accessible stations will be 
inspected at adequate intervals.

Clearly, in any inspection system there needs to be an 
element of surprise. Any inspection which was pre-planned 
and advertised as such would be less likely to reveal 
deficiencies and would rightly be criticised as inadequate. 
Further consideration could however be given as to whether 
the existing balance between achieving transparency and the 
element of surprise, as against the considerable costs of 
inspections and an uneven coverage of stations and 
facilities, is the best that can be achieved.  Are there, for 
example, means of reducing costs, increasing coverage but not 
reducing the unexpected nature of inspections?

The Treaty Parties have already discussed ways of reducing 
costs by co-operation between Parties and more efficient use 
of supporting logistic arrangements.  One means of attempting 
to acquire a more equitable coverage of inspections might be

dhe/341.3          /through
through the introduction of some form of rolling inspection 
programme, whereby within a broad time period of agreed 
frequency each station would be inspected at regular 
intervals.

For this purpose Antarctica could be sub-divided into four 
zones to ensure that inspection coverage could be monitored 
more easily. It would not be the intention that any one base 
would necessarily be inspected in a specified year. Rather, 
that each base within each zone would be inspected within an 
agreed time-frame. (Five years might be a suitable period).

  In the proposed rotational system Contracting Parties could 
agree several years in advance of inspections to offer 
observers in joint groups of two or three countries.  As many 
Contracting Parties as possible could offer qualified 
personnel as observers and contribute logistically and 
financially towards inspections. Such co-operation might 
usefully include, where possible, logistical assistance by 
the country or countries whose stations are being inspected.

  Ultimately, co-ordination of Antarctic Treaty Inspections 
might be an appropriate task to assign to the Treaty 
Secretariat when it is established.  However, in the 
meantime, and to reduce the chances of duplication, it is 
suggested that Treaty Parties contemplating Inspections in 
any one year should provide early notification, in broad 
terms only, of their intentions.
