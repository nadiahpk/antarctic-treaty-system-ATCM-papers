(submitted by Argentina)
Review and verification of the pollution prevention mechanisms 
on the "Almirante Irizar" ice-breaker

        (Item 6b of the Agenda)

According to Annex IV of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty 
on Prevention of Marine Pollution, the following adjustments have 
been made to the "Almirante Irizar" ice-breaker:

Since its construction, the icebreaker was equipped with a 
filtering and water/oily residue separation system (SAREX, Model 
100 GPM-ECC) having a separation capacity of 100 parts per million 
maximum, thereby meeting the provisions of Rules 9 and 16 of Annex 
I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution 
from Ships.

In 1992, a new monitoring device (SAREX Model OCA-1, serial 
number 771-609/770-609) was purchased from the manufacturer of the 
separating device, "Separating and Recover & Systems INC". Said 
device is capable of detecting the pollution of liquids up to 15 
parts per million. It was installed to replace the initial system.

In July 1993, the system and its calibration were checked for 
detection and warning purposes at 15 parts per million.

As a result of this adjustment, the system is equipped today 
with a new separation capacity as required by Rules 9 and 16 of the 
1984 amendments to the Annex to the 1978 Protocol to the MARPOL 
Convention and the second part of the IMO's Resolution A-393 (X).

In addition to the above information it is appropriate to 
report that:

1
- There are no occurrences of dumping of toxic liquid substances from the icebreaker in the Antarctic Treaty area.

- All refuse and incineration residue are disposed of outside the Antarctic Treaty area each time the icebreaker drops anchor in the ports of Ushuala, Galvan, or Buenos Aires.

- Food leftovers are first ground up in sieves with holes of 25 millimeters in diameter and then thrown overboard at a distance exceeding 12 (twelve) miles from the coast or ice shelves.

- All residual waters produced by the ship are treated at a biological treatment plant in accordance with Rules 2 and 3 of Annex 4 of the 73/78 MARPOL Convention and its amendments.

- The mud tank, which has a capacity of 43 cubic meters and is used to hold oily residue exceeding 15 parts per million, is disembarked at the Buenos Aires port at the conclusion of the Antarctic campaigns. The fuel tanks may not be used to ballast the ship. The ballast tanks may only be filled with sea water.
