Issue Relating to the Exercise of
Jurisdiction in Antarctica

Agenda Item 16

(submitted by Uruguay)
Issues Relating to the Exercise of
Jurisdiction in Antarctica

(Agenda Item 16)

I) Background

Article VIII of the Antarctic Treaty states that: "in order
to facilitate the exercise of their functions under the present
Treaty, and without prejudice to the respective positions of the
Contracting Parties relating to jurisdiction over all other persons
in Antarctica, observers designated under paragraph 1 of Article
VII and scientific personnel exchanged under sub-paragraph 1 (b) of
Article III of the Treaty, and members of staffs accompanying any
such persons, shall be subject only to the jurisdiction of the
Contracting Parties of which they are nationals in respect of all
acts or omissions occurring while they are in Antarctica for the
purposes of exercising their functions" (Paragraph 1).

Article VIII also states further on that: "Without prejudice
to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, and pending the
adoption of measures in pursuance of sub-paragraph 1 (e) of Article
IX, the Contracting Parties concerned in any case of dispute with
regard to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica, shall
immediately consult together with a view to reaching a mutually
acceptable solution" (Paragraph 2).

Also, Article IX sub-paragraph 1 (e) states that: "questions
relating to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica" are to be
included in Recommendations submitted during Consultative Meetings.
This shows that when the Treaty was drawn up Contracting Parties

1
were already aware of the need to further develop the issue of 
jurisdiction.

The various increasing activities of member States in 
Antarctica involving people from different countries, the presence 
and activity of people from non-member States or not connected to 
activities carried out by member States in the area have recently 
emphasized the need to draw up, although in simple terms, 
regulations with reference to jurisdiction.

Indeed, in accordance with existing embryonic regulations and 
given the new situation, it is increasingly important to lay down 
complementary rules in the field of jurisdiction over people, and 
resources in Antarctica. Otherwise, people may be responsible for 
actions or omissions on other people or facilities in Antarctica 
without being subject to any type of jurisdiction.  This would 
entail negative consequences and high risks for the development and 
success of the increasingly complex Antarctic Treaty System.

For some time now Uruguayan representatives who work at the 
Artigas Scientific Station have repeatedly stressed the need for 
more detailed general rules in the field of jurisdiction.  This 
need is particularly urgent given the increasing number of people 
who visit these stations for different reasons and under various 
circumstances, with special reference to the so-called "accidental 
tourists or scientists" who are generally not subject to the 
jurisdiction of the member States and may give rise to serious 
practical problems.

Issues relating to "Tourism and non-governmental activities" 
also have juridical implications and therefore deserve special 
attention.

2
A January 1992 accident at the Bellinghausen Russian Station, 
on King George Island, which caused the death of a Russian station 
employee and involved a member of the Uruguayan Station, stressed 
one more time the importance of the problem and the need to examine 
it within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty System.

Consequently, it is advisable to start examining this issue in 
order to come up with new rules that will be acceptable unanimously 
to all member States.  These measures would save the Parties, when 
caught up with urgent and compelling matters, from regulating and 
implementing criteria that might hamper the fulfillment of the 
principles and objectives of the Antarctic Treaty System.

•	In particular, we would like to regulate those situations 
which up to now have not been juridically or practically solved, 
especially when persons or facilities of the State Parties are 
affected by acts or omissions of nationals from non-Member States, 
or of nationals from Member States acting independently of their 
own countries.  This, of course, without altering the respective 
positions of the Contracting Parties.

II) Review of existing regulations and the need to complement them

•	First of all, the above mentioned Article VII of the Antarctic 
Treaty, subjects to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party of 
which they are nationals, in respect of acts or omissions occurring 
while they are in Antarctica for the purpose of exercising their 
functions, "observers designated under Article VII paragraph 1 and 
scientific personnel exchanged under Article III sub-paragraph 1 
(b) of the Treaty and members of staffs accompanying any such 
persons."

3
Consequently, no reference is made to:

a) subjecting to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party of 
which they are nationals, the staff, scientific personnel and other 
persons sent by the Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty area 
(for instance, officials or other visitors) while exercising their 
functions within the range of activities carried out by the Party 
in compliance with the Treaty, in respect of all acts or omissions 
while these persons are in Antarctica.

b) subjecting to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party 
the staff, scientific personnel and other persons who are neither 
nationals of this Party nor of any other Contracting Party and who 
are sent to the Antarctic Treaty area while exercising their 
functions and within the range of activities carried out by the 
member States in compliance with the Treaty, in respect to acts or 
omissions while these persons are in Antarctica.

c) subjecting to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party 
persons who are not nationals of any Contracting Party, and are not 
covered by the aforementioned paragraph, and who in the Antarctic 
Treaty area are responsible for acts or omissions which affect said 
Contracting Party, or persons or facilities subject to its 
jurisdiction.

Up to now, the hypothesis submitted in paragraph a) above has 
been interpreted and solved by member States by analogy on the 
basis of the provisions of Article VIII paragraph 1 of the 
Antarctic Treaty; a practical solution which has been peacefully 
accepted since the entry into force of the Treaty.

4
However the more recent hypotheses submitted in paragraphs b) 
and c) above have given rise to compounding problems regarding 
interpretation and possible solution, and the consultative 
procedures envisaged in the aforementioned provision of Article 
VIII paragraph 2 of the Treaty - although opening a path towards a 
resolution - does not seem suitable for the adoption of the urgent 
measures that are required.

We believe that the regulation of the above-mentioned 
hypotheses conforms to the objective set forth in Article VIII 
which is to facilitate "the exercise of the functions" that the 
Treaty assigns to the Contracting Parties and without prejudice to 
their "respective positions ... relating to jurisdiction of all 
other persons in Antarctica."

The very wording of the Treaty recognized originally that its 
provisions regarding jurisdiction were somewhat embryonic. As a 
matter of fact, showing foresight as it did in other important 
subjects, the Treaty lists in Article IX paragraph 1 e) as one of 
the objectives of the Consultative Meetings to recommend measures 
regarding " questions relating to exercise of jurisdiction in 
Antarctica ", thus emphasizing one of the questions which would 
eventually require study taking into account the future development 
and the complexity of activities in the area.
