Opening Address

(Agenda Item 3)

The delegation of Chile believes that it might be useful to open once again a short debate to enable those delegations who request to do so in advance to address general or specific issues. 
Part of the first plenary session could be devoted to such a debate, without however shortening the presentation of the speeches which are to be included in the final report.

After three decades of meetings, and given that the Antarctic system is becoming increasingly complex, it is advisable that the debate be kept open so as not to lose sight of the basic principles which inspired the Antarctic Treaty, as well as the rapid development of events on the polar continent itself.
