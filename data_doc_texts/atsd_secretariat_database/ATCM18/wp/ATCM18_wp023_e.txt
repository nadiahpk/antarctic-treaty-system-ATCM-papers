ANTARCTIC TREATY
XVIIIth CONSULTATIVE MEETING

Kyoto, Japan
11-22 April 1994

Proposal for the
Protection of Geological Specimens

Environmental Monitoring and Data

Agenda Item 9 d

[Submitted by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]
Recommendation SCAR XXII-1

On Protection of Geological Specimens

RECALLING the commitment to environmental protection under the Antarctic Treaty;
RECOGNIZING the increasing frequency of non-scientific activities in Antarctica; and
RECOGNIZING further the consequent possible loss of scientifically valuable geological specimens;

MINDFUL of the possible consequences of identifying the location of such geological specimens through formal site protection;

NOTING the likelihood of further discoveries of such specimens;

SCAR recommends that:

1. Geological specimens, such as fossils, minerals, meteorites, volcanic bombs and ventifacts in Antarctica should be collected for scientific or educational purposes and not for commercial gain;

2. Geological samples collected from Antarctica for these purposes should be properly curated in institutions accessible to the scientific community and, wherever possible, should be publicly displayed.
