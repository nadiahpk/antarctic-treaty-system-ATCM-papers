Inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty

Item 9 of the Agenda

(submitted by the United Kingdom,
Italy and the Republic of Korea)
Inspections under Article VII
of the Antarctic Treaty
(Item 9 of the Agenda)

1.      INTRODUCTION

In Working Paper Number 30 submitted by Argentina (XVIII ATCM/WP 30, dated 11 April 1994) a number of points were made relating to inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty, and more specifically to the Joint Treaty Inspection of Argentine Stations carried out during the austral summer of 1992 /93 by observers from the United Kingdom, Italy and the Republic of Korea.

The United Kingdom, Italy and the Republic of Korea would like to respond to the points, none of those which concern the conduct of the Joint Treaty Inspection having been made before Argentina raised them at the present ATCM.

2.      GENERAL COMMENTS

The XI Antarctic Special Consultative Meeting agreed that, pending entry into force and in accordance with their legal systems, the Consultative Parties should apply the provisions of the Environmental Protocol to the extent practicable. This agreement was further endorsed at the XVI ATCM.

At the XVIII ATCM the Consultative Parties noted that inspections, in addition to verifying adherence to the fundamental principles and objectives of the Antarctic Treaty, now require emphasis on environmental matters.

Given the above, the objectives of the UK/Italy/Republic of Korea inspection were to examine:

i)      compliance with the Antarctic Treaty:
ii)     observance of the Environmental Protocol.

3.      SPECIFIC COMMENTS

3.1     Notification Procedures

In accordance with Article VII (1) of the Antarctic Treaty the United Kingdom notified by means of a Diplomatic note, dated 16 December 1992, all Consultative Parties of the names of designated observers and the proposal to carry out Inspections under the Treaty.

3.2     The Inspection Checklists
The checklists were prepared in the period between the XVII ATCM (11-20 November 1992) and the departure of the inspection team for Antarctica (4 January 1993). The checklists were finalized on the eve of departure of the team. This meant that the checklists could not be translated into the other official Treaty languages.

The conclusions of the Inspection Report make it clear that for future inspections in the Antarctic Peninsula area it may be useful to have checklists not only in English but also in Spanish or Russian in order to simplify communication.

The checklist was used only as an aide-memoire by the inspectors. It was not a questionnaire, and was not used as one. Copies of the checklist were given to the stations inspected.

3.3 Nature and complexity of the issues

The Inspection Team found that without exception the station Commanders were very knowledgeable about their stations and could answer the questions of the Inspectors.

3.4 Personnel

The Inspection Team noted the numbers of military and civilian personnel on each base visited to give an accurate picture of the organisational structure of the station.
