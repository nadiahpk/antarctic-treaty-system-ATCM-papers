Argentinean-German Cooperation at the Jubany Base
Inauguration of the Dallman Laboratory at
25 de Mayo Island, South Shetlands

(Item 13 of the Agenda)

In accordance with the purposes and principles of the
Antarctic Treaty which seek to promote international cooperation in
Antarctica, an important cooperation program in the field of marine
biology was established in 1989 by the Argentine Republic (National
Administration of Antarctica) and the Federal Republic of Germany
(Alfred Wegener Institute).

In light of the above, a joint construction project of a
laboratory adjacent to the facilities of the "Jubany" Argentine
base was undertaken as a result of the 1991/92 Antarctic Campaign.
Said laboratory is located on 25 de Mayo Island, in the South
Shetland Archipelago.

The laboratory, which was inaugurated on January 20th, 1994,
has a dry unit, a wet unit, an equipment room, a diving tank, three
sets of living quarters, bathrooms, and a rest area. To better
visualize the layout of the laboratory, a diagram is enclosed
herein.

Among the main scientific programs underway at said
laboratory, those pertaining to the environment of coastal areas as
well as to Antarctica's birds and mammals deserve particular
attention.

Information related to the aforementioned programs will be
forwarded in greater detail to the Parties in accordance with
Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty.
