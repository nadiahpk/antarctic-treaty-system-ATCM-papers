Agenda Item 6 b

Committee on Environmental Protection in Antarctica

Draft Rules of Procedure

*********

Drafting of the Committee's agenda and of the 
list of documents which must reach said 
Committee before its meeting (and the Parties)

(Agenda Item 6 b)

General context:

-   The Protocol on Environmental Protection and its annexes 
lay down specific rules which make the Committee on 
Environmental Protection the receiver of documents, reports, 
information, data that will be necessary for it to provide 
advice so as to enable the Consultative Parties to reach a 
decision at the ATCM.

-   It is thus essential to determine at the same time, 
within the Committee's rules of procedure:

    -   the content of the agenda
    -   the deadline before which the agenda must be 
finalized and sent to the Parties to the Protocol
    -   the deadline before which the background documents 
must be sent to the Parties to the Protocol with 
regard to the rules laid down in this instrument 
and its annexes.

1
Modalities which could be adopted

-   The Committee should normally hold its ordinary session right before the ATCM meeting.

-   A period of one hundred days for the receipt of the agenda and documents should be acceptable.

-   Indeed, the basis for this reasoning is article 3 - paragraph 4 of annex I which stipulates that any global environmental impact assessment shall be forwarded for consideration as appropriate to the Committee at the same time as it is circulated to the Parties at least 120 days before the ATCM: we can thus reasonably set a 100 day period before the Committee meeting for the sending to the Committee members of other documents which shall be used as reference for their discussions.

-   The representatives of the Parties to the Protocol must be given enough time to study the documents on which they will have to decide, provide advice and formulate recommendations at the Committee's meeting in accordance with article 12 of the Protocol.

*********
*****

-   The tables enclosed summarize what is required in light of the provisions of the Protocol and of its annexes and could themselves be annexed to the rules of procedure.

-   The ATCM should in all likelihood entrust the Committee with other tasks on the basis of the terms of the provisions of the Protocol's article 12:  it is therefore advisable that the rules of procedure account for this possibility.
