(submitted by Chile)
Protocol on the Protection of the Antarctic Environment

(Agenda Item 6 b)

The delegation of Chile is concerned with the slow ratification of the Protocol on the Protection of the Antartic Environment.

The final report of the XI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting stated "that pending the entry into force of the Protocol, it is desirable for all Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty to apply Annexes I through IV, in accordance with their own legal systems and that, to the extent practicable, each adopt the appropriate measures to reach that end as soon as possible."

Three summers have elapsed in Antarctica, and it is obvious that these provisions have either not been implemented or when so, it has been in an uncoordinated and inefficient manner.

This matter is of particular concern to those countries which surround the continent of the South Pole whose ecosystems are dependent and closely associated with the Antarctic ecosystem.

The Chilean delegation believes that the time has come, pending the entry into force of the Protocol on the Protection of the Antarctic Environment and its annexes, and the establishment of the Committee, to set up a voluntary Inter-session Coordinating and Implementing Group for the Protocol's Annexes, as authorized by the XVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, so that from certain access points located near Antarctica said committee observe and

1
inform the next ATCM's on the way in which the recommended 
protective and coordinating measures are implemented.

The Coordinating Group would work in close cooperation 
with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the 
Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (CONMAP), and 
to the extent possible shorten the existing time lag between the 
Protocol's signing and its entry into force.
