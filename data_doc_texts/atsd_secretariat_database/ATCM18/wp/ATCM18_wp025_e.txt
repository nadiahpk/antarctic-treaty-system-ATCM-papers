ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND DATA

Agenda Item 10 d

(Submitted by Japan)
This paper expresses the view of Japanese delegation on the Agenda 
Item 10 d

In principle, scientific samples are collected by a scientist to verify 
his hypothesis and/or idea, based on his scientific interests and motivation. 
Sampling is carried out at the appropriate sites and time to clearly explain 
his hypothesis and/or idea. Techniques and methods used for sampling are 
also selected based on their suitability for his purpose. Namely, it may be 
said that sampling of scientific materials such as rocks, snow and ice, 
water, fossils, plants and animals is undertaken in a scientist's self-
interested manner. There may be some cases that scientist asks other 
scientists to make investigations on the characteristics and components 
other than what he primarily aimed in the samples in order to attain 
comparative and/or supporting information. However, in all cases above 
scientists do not necessarily intend to open their samples to the public.

Meanwhile, it is useful and effective that the samples collected by a 
scientist or a group of scientists are provided for the use of other scientists. 
Particularly it is true in such a case that the samples are collected in 
Antarctica. For example, biological samples contributes to the comparative 
studies of geographical distribution and seasonal fluctuation of ecosystem 
and their component organism. Sharing rocks, minerals, fossils or 
meteorites not only facilitates comparative studies but also contributes to 
the conservation of locations where those samples were obtained.

National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), Tokyo, as well as other 
Japanese and foreign institutes, has continued to make samples available for 
other scientific research as much as possible.

  As for moss specimen, classified specimen housed in the NIPR 
herbarium are listed in the catalogs published by NIPR for the world-wide 
announcement (Annex 1 and 2). The NIPR herbarium is recognized as one 
of the public herbaria by the International Association of Plant Taxonomy 
and its name, structure and function are described in the Index Herbarium, 
Part 1: The Herbaria of the world (Annex 3). Thus, all specimen listed in 
the catalogs are available to the scientists on request to the curator.

  Primarily-sorted marine biological samples are also announced in the 
JARE Data Reports (Annex 4), which is published serially but irregularly 
by NIPR and distributed to the relevant research organizations. Inquiry on 
the specimen is welcomed by the Department of Biological Data of NIPR.
At present, rock samples are opened only in Japan but scientists who visits NIPR are able to use them in the Institute. The global expansion of service is under consideration.

Careful attention has been paid to the collection, processing, distribution and research of meteorites due to their preciousness and importance. Department of Antarctic Meteorites of NIPR has engaged in the administration and distribution work of the sample, taking into account the advice from a committee which consists of the specialists and relevant NIPR staff. For reference, the role of Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) and NIPR in the process from collecting samples to publishing scientific results is mentioned below.

• First of all, to discover and collect meteorites in the Antarctic continent, it is needed to access to the blue ice area on the ice-sheet. JARE has to carry out over-snow traverse to a destination. Meteorites sampled carefully to prevent human contamination are transported to NIPR, being kept within clean desiccators on the Shirase.

Then samples are classified primarily by the staff of the Department of Antarctic Meteorites of NIPR. Scientific characteristics of classified meteorites are informed to the about 550 relevant scientists (250 in Japan and 300 overseas). Photographic catalog is published for easy selection and further identification of the samples.

Referring above information and taking the conditions decided by NIPR (Annex 5) into account, scientists submit applications to the NIPR curator. Research plan, specification of the required samples and other information are requested to be described in the form (Annex 6). All proposals are examined by the Committee mentioned before and adoption of proposal and amount of examples to be allocated are decided in accordance with the conditions of Annex 5. Usually, NIPR receives about 70 proposals from Japanese scientists and 30 ones from foreign scientists per year.

• Results obtained through the research with allocated samples are requested to be presented in the NIPR Symposium on Antarctic Meteorites held annually in NIPR, Tokyo. Most of the presentations are included in the Proceedings of the symposium or published in other relevant scientific issues. About 400 copies of the Proceedings are sent to the overseas research organizations and another 400 copies of Proceedings are distributed to the Japanese universities and institutes.
In the above paragraphs, actual features and procedures of sample handling in NIPR are given. It is desirable to open samples for common use of scientists and it may be beneficial to the progress of Antarctic science as well as science as a whole. However, it should be remembered that collection and handling of scientific samples shall be made only based on the autonomy of scientists.

INTRODUCTION

The catalog contains data of moss specimens which were collected from Antarctica 
and adjacent regions. The data treated here is restricted to the specimens housed in 
Japanese herbaria. There are approximately 6000 specimens comprising 5500 musci 
and 500 hepatics, 5000 of which have been housed in the herbarium of the National 
Institute of Polar Research. This herbarium has received recognition on an interna-
tional level being allocated the code NIPR in the 7th edition of Index Herbariorum 
(HOLMGREN et al., 1981).

The NIPR collection mainly consists of specimens brought back from the Syowa 
Station area (67°-70°S, 38°-46°E) in which activities of the Japanese Antarctic Research 
Expedition have been undertaken. It covers the east part of Queen Maud Land and 
the west of Enderby Land. The collection results from increasing interest by taxono-
mists, ecologists and physiologists since Syowa Station was established on the East 
Ongul Island during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1956-1958.

Main collections of mosses sampled from Continental Antarctica are shown in 
Table 1. T. MATSUDA, who joined the wintering party during 1961-1962 carried out 
some ecological studies on mosses on East Ongul Island and collected a lot of material 
(MATSUDA, 1963, 1968). Substantial collecting from the Syowa Station area com-
menced during the first terrestrial biology study project which was undertaken in 1973-
1976 (KOBAYASHI, 1974; NAKANISHI, 1977; YAMANAKA and SATO, 1977; SHIMIZU, 1977; 
OCHI, 1979). H. SHIMIZU, a botanist who joined the wintering party in 1973-1974, 
extended the area sampled by making collections from more than 20 ice-free localities. 
H. KANDA, a bryologist visited the area twice in the 1977-1978 summer and 1983 
winter and carried out taxonomical and ecological work on mosses. He collected 
numerous specimens for the herbarium (KANDA, 1981a, b; SEPPELT and KANDA, 1986; 
KANDA and OCHI, 1986).

Together with Continental Antarctic specimens, the herbarium houses the collec-
tions brought back from Maritime Antarctica and Subantarctic regions. The record 
of collections is shown in Table 2.

Approximately 1000 Antarctic specimens of musci are distributed in the following 
Japanese herbaria, the National Science Museum, Tokyo (TNS), the Hattori Botanical 
Laboratory, Nichinan (NICH) and Hiroshima University (HIRO). All Antarctic speci-
mens of these herbaria have been accumulated through exchanges with foreign herbaria,

mainly that of the British Antarctic Survey (AAS): data from these specimens is treated 
in the catalog.

For the convenience of biogeographical studies, specimens collected in the vicinity 
of ports visited by Japanese Antarctic research ships were also housed in the herbarium. 
The present catalog contains data of these specimens.

The identification of specimens is now in progress. Many have been given a 
preliminary generic name. At present, however, it seems that this catalog is useful
Introduction                                              3

to acquire precise information on the moss flora in the Antarctic as well as in the area 
dealt with here. Improvement and revision of this will be made with the increase in 
identified specimens in the future.

One of the features of the catalog is that all of the data is processed by the com-
puter system of the institute (HITACHI M-260H). This is similar to the systems of 
the herbaria of the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge (AAS) and Institute of Ter-
restrial Ecology, Edinburgh, which were probably the first to process moss data by 
computer (Greene and Greene, 1975; Greene, 1972a, b). It is also possible to sort 
for taxonomical and geographical purposes. Thus, the computer system makes the 
herbarium specimens and information more accessible to the user and it can be used 
for a variety of purposes.

Introduction

The catalog of moss specimens from Antarctica and adjacent regions, and the catalog 
of the biological specimens stored in NIPR were compiled by Kanda in 1987. However, 
all the specimens treated in these catalogs are provided in the dried or immersed condition. 
Besides these specimes, living or frozen specimens are also desired for physiological, 
ecophysiological, ecological or taxonomical studies. The catalog of the frozen botanical 
specimens collecetd from polar regions was prepared at the reqests of lots of users. Many 
specimens have already been given preliminary generic or specific names, but revised 
editions of this catalog will be made as further specimens are determined in the future.

As part of the international BIOMASS (Biological Investigations of
Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks) programme, the Japanese Antarctic
Research Expedition (JARE) conducted a three-year programme of marine
biological investigations in the fast ice area near Syowa Station during 1982
(JARE-23) through 1984 (JARE-25). Zooplankton were sampled routinely at
three fixed stations near Syowa Station in JARE-25 (Fig. 1). Details of the
sampling methods and the sampling frequencies are published in JARE Data
Reports No. 121 (MATSUDA et al., 1987).

This report summarizes the data on zooplankton collected in the JARE-25
over-wintering programme in 1984. A total of 52 samples were obtained with
two kinds of Norpac nets during February 1984 through January 1985 (Table 1).
Size of both is 45 cm in diameter and 180 cm in side length. The mesh
openings of the nets were 25 μm (P25 net) and 330 μm (GG54), respectively.
The results of primary sorting are presented here.

* JARE-25 BIOLOGY Cont. No. 13.
Zooplankton samples were sorted into 11 categories as shown in the attached zooplankton record sheets here. Category 1 was composed of four microzooplankton groups; ciliates, foraminifers, copepod nauplii and unidentified eggs. Copepoda (Category 6) includes Calanoida, Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida. Euphausiacea (Category 7) includes nauplius and calyptopis stages. Planktonic larval forms (Category 9) include benthic invertebrate larvae (i.e., polychaetes, gastropods, bryozoans, brachiopods, echinoderms and ascidians). Sample processing and treatment of data were the same as described in the preceding report (cf. TANIMURA et al., 1989); the specimens were sorted from a whole sample or subsample divided with suitable proportion according to sample size, and total number of each category per haul and a unit volume of water filtered (m^(3)) are summed up from individual numbers obtained at each sorting stage. Specimens for each category were sorted into individual vials and preserved in formalin (3% in seawater). They are retained at the National Institute of Polar Research, Tokyo. These samples are open to the use of any scientists. Further details on the data and specimens can be obtained from:

REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES FOR ANTARCTIC METEORITES

RESEARCH ON JAPANESE COLLECTION

Formal requests for Antarctic meteorite samples for scientific research and display should be submitted in writing along with the formal request form to Keizo Yanai, Curator of Antarctic Meteorites, National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), Tokyo.

Requests are welcome from all qualified scientists in the world and will be reviewed and considered one or two times each year by the Committee on Antarctic Meteorite Research of the NIPR in Japan. Consortium-type sample requests may also be submitted. When your proposal is accepted by the committee, the requested samples will be sent to you from the Curator of Antarctic Meteorites, NIPR.

SAMPLE ALLOCATION

1. Sample allocation may be limited under one gram for each sample.
2. Sample allocation may be maximum 10 samples for each research proposed.
3. All samples are provided as a lone.
4. In a case of display, it may be provided as a lone base.
5. Sample requests should include detailed Meteorite Name, preferable weight and minimum weight requirements, sites(crust, outer part, inner part and central part, etc.,), shapes(powder, grains, fragments, chips, cubes, plates, thin section(TS) and polished thin section(PTS)) etc.

SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION

1. Sublease of meteorite samples is not permitted to anybody except coinvestigators of the proposed research. If sublease is required to other investigators, a new separate proposal form must be submitted to the Antarctic Meteorite Research Committee prior to the sample transfer.
2. Return of unused or remaining meteorite sample and PTS to the curator is requested upon completion of the proposed research.

REPORTING RESULT

1. Any result of your studies is encouraged to be reported promptly. It is desirable to report at the Symposium on Antarctic Meteorites sponsored by the NIPR. The presented papers at this symposium will be published as the Proceedings of the symposium after review by the editorial committee of the NIPR. Two referees will read the paper. Instruction to contribution can be obtained from the Library of the NIPR. The symposium will be held each year, customarily in late February.
2. It is also possible to submit paper to the Antarctic Record and to the Proceedings of the NIPR Symposium on Antarctic Meteorites.
3. Three reprints of each article and one copy of abstract which was published in other journal including abstract volume(s) than those of the NIPR should be sent to the curator by authors.
