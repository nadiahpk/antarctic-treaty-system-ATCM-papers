REPORT ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ACTIVITIES
OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMS[S]ION
TO THE EIGHTEENTH ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING

(Submitted by IOC)
INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMISSION(IOC)
REPORT ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ACTIVITIES OF 
THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAFHIC COMMISSION 
TO THE EIGHTEENTH ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING 
(Kyoto City, Japan, 11-22 April 1994)

Submitted by the Secretary IOC

The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission(IOC) was founded in 1960 
as a functionally autonomous body within UNESCO and now includes 124 Member 
States. The IOC promotes marine scientific investigations and related ocean services 
with a view to learning more about the nature and resources of the 
oceans and coastal areas.

Since the 1960s the Commission has continued its efforts to promote and 
co-ordinate scientific research and related ocean services in the Southern 
Ocean. For this purpose the Commission established in 1967 the Regional 
Committee for the Southern Ocean. Many activities have being implemented 
within the framework of other IOC research. and ocean services programmes in 
collaboration with various international organizations.

In 1993 the Seventeenth session of the IOC Assembly revised its 
activities in the SOuthern Ocean. For this purpose the report " The Southern 
Ocean: A Review of Activities in Relation to IOC Programmes" (doc. IOC/INF-909) 
had been prepared and presented to the Assembly.

The Report indicates that the efforts of the Commission during the last 
years have been concentrated on:

(i)        strengthening international research programme in co-operation 
           with other international organizations(ICSU/SCOR/SCAR, WMO, UNEP) 
           dealing with:
           
-   study of the role of the ocean in global climate changes 
    and variability within the World Climate Research 
    Programme, sponsored presently by WMO, IOC, ICSU and UNEP. 
    The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCR) as a main 
    ocean component of WCRP (1990-1997) has a Core Project 2 
    " The Southern Ocean" totally devoted to the Southern Ocean 
    study.

-   investigation of marine pollution through the joint IOC-
    UNEP Programme on Global Investigation of Pollution in the 
    Marine Envirionment (GIPME) and its Marine Pollution 
    Monitoring Programme and Open-Ocean Baseline Study. The 
    overall objective of GIPME is to provide a scientifically 
    sound basis for the assessment and regulation of marine 
    contamination and pollution. On this problem IOC also co-
    operates with IMO. WMO, ISES. SAO and other organization.

-   study of the role of the ocean in global CO balance through 
    its scientific panel and by co-operating with SCOR in the 
    Joint Global Ocean Flum Study(JGOFS) as a core project of 
    IGBP which includes the JGOFS Southern Ocean Study.

-   ocean ecosystem dynamics study through the international 
    GLOBEC(Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) programme jointly 
    sponsored by SCAR, IOC, and ICER, which includes the GLOBEC 
    Southern Ocean component.

(ii)       expansion and improvement of ocean observations and data exchange 
           through:

-   increased support of existing operational programmes:
    *Joint IOC-WMO Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS)
    *IOC Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS)
    *WMO-IOC International Oceanographic Data and information 
    Exchange
(IOCE) System
-   development of the Global Ocean Observing System(IGOSS) in 
co-operation with WMO, UNEP,and ICSU. This initiative of 
IOC has received support by the UNCED (Rio, 1992). In 
addressing critical uncertainties for the management of the 
marine environment and climate change called for states to 
"consider supporting the role of IOC in co-operation with 
WMO, UNEP and other international organization in the 
collection, analysis and distribution of data and 
information from the oceans and all seas, including as 
appropriate through the proposed Global Ocean Observing 
System (GOOS)" (Agenda 21, Chapter 21, Chapter 17, Section E) As 
envisaged,, GOOS as a comprehensive and integrated system 
will provide a mechanism for the co-ordinated management of 
observations of major physical, chemical and biological 
properties of the world ocean. GOOS will provide for the 
ocean component of the Global Climate Observing System 
(GOOS) to be developed by joint efforts of WMO, IOC, UNEP 
and ICSU. THe ocean measurements made today particularly 
in the Southern Ocean are too coarse on temporal and 
spatial scale for documenting processes important to global 
ocean, climate and environmental change. The Southern 
ocean surrounding the continent of Antarctica, because of 
its vastness, the remoteness of this ocean from the nations 
that have historically conducted much of the research in 
this region, and the likely significance of this ocean 
region in global climate change scenarios, will require 
special attention and efforts in the processes important to global 
planning of GOOS and strengthened co-operation of various 
international organizations dealing with various aspects of 
the Southern ocean (SCAR, SCOR, CCAMLR, WMO, FAO). GOOS 
when fully operational will provide sound basis for 
protection of the Antarctic Marine Environment within the 
"Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty".

iii)  close interaction with other international governmental and non-
governmental organizations
-   IOC has established close working contacts with various 
international organizations involved in the study of the 
Southern Ocean:ICSU/SCAR and SCOR, CCAMLR, WMO, IWC, UNEP. 
Representative of IOC took part in the recent meetings of 
SCAR and CCAMLR. Since 1989 IOC has been invited to 
participate as an observer in the meetings of ATCM and has 
attended/

The IOC Assembly at its Seventeenth session (1993) decided to 
retain the IOC Regional Committee for the Southern Ocean as an 
intergovernmental forum for promotion and co-operation of research and ocean 
services and relevant TEMA activities in the Southern Ocean, particularly 
related to GOOS, WCRP, GIPME and OSLA.

The Assembly invited Member States interested in the Southern 
Ocean to designate their official national contacts for SOC, Argentina, Australia, 
Ecuador, France, Germany Russian Federation, United Kingdom.

The Assembly also recommended that the Secretary continue close 
interaction either directly and/or through SOC National Contacts, with 
governmental and non-governmental bodies such as ATCM, SCAR and SCOR (of 
ICSU), CCAMLR, WMO, FAO. and UNEP, with a view to strengthening international 
research programmes and improvement of ocean observations and data exchange 
in the Southern Ocean in order to meet the requirements of UNCED Agenda 21(
Chapter 17), the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on
Biological Diversity as well as the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection.
