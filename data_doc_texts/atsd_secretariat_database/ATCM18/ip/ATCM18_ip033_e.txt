CLEAN-UP AND CONSERVATION OF ABANDONED BRITISH BASES IN
THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA REGION

LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND

Recommendations I-IX and VI-14 on Historic Sites and Monuments oblige Governments to adopt measures to preserve and protect historic buildings, sites or other artefacts of historical interest in Antarctica from damage or destruction. Annex III of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty contains mandatory measures to ensure that abandoned bases and work sites are cleaned up. However, this obligation does not require the removal of any structure designated as an Historic Monument (HM) under Recommendation I-IX, or under Annex V to the Environmental Protocol, or if the removal of any waste material is likely to cause a greater adverse impact than leaving that material untouched.

THE BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY CLEAN-UP AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMME

It is against this background that the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has established a clean-up programme for the remaining eighteen British bases and two huts left unoccupied in Antarctica since 1947 (Table 1 and Figure 1). An initial study was completed, and a clean-up action plan established, in 1990. Field surveys were undertaken during the 1990/91 and 1991/92 seasons of all those abandoned bases which still remained accessible. The aim of the clean-up programme is for each of the abandoned bases to be visited as soon as practicable and hazardous and toxic wastes, fuel and litter to be removed.

Four bases have been visited so far by BAS clean-up teams:

i)     Halley III               1990/91
ii)    Deception Island        1990/91 and 1991/92
iii)   Stonington Island       1991/92
iv)    Halley 1V               1991/92 and 1992/93

The most comprehensive clean-up has been carried out at Halley 1V with the removal of all hazardous wastes, fuel, surface facilities, station contents and most fixtures and /fittings.

fittings. Because of the hazardous structural condition of 
this base, Halley IV has since been sealed up and access is 
prohibited.

The clean-up programme planned for the 1993/94 season was 
cancelled when the support vessel, the RRS "James Clark Ross", 
was called to assist the RRS "Bransfield" in the Weddell Sea 
during February 1994. For a short period the RRS "Bransfield" 
was without power after a fire in her engine room and could have 
needed an ocean tow from RRS "James Clark Ross".

The next stage of the BAS plan is to ensure that an assessment 
is made of future action for each of the abandoned bases. 
Options are:  clean-up, clean-up and removal, repair and 
maintenance as an emergency refuge, or restoration and 
conservation as a designated Historic Monument (HM).  At 
present, no British former base or hut has been declared an HM.

UK ANTARCTIC HERITAGE TRUST/CONSERVATION SURVEY

The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) was established in 1993 
with the overall objective to "inform and educate the British 
people about their Antarctic heritage, and to preserve that 
heritage in the Antarctic and in Britain".  This objective not 
only includes assistance to the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage 
Trust (NZAHT) in the preservation of Scott's and Shackleton's 
historic huts in the Ross Dependency, but also the preservation 
of those British abandoned bases and huts which may be 
designated as Historic Monuments in the future.

In 1993, to help initiate the activities of the UKAHT, British 
Antarctic Territory funds were provided to the Trust to enable 
an experienced conservator from the NZAHT to travel to the 
Antarctic Peninsula to inspect as many of the abandoned British 
bases and huts as possible.  This Conservation Survey was 
carried out in February/March 1994 and will culminate in a 
report to the UKAHT, BAT and BAS comprising:

            /-  a
dhe/316.3
-   a record of each site visited, using checklists, 
    written notes, photographs and video and producing, 
    where possible, architectural and building surveys;

-   practical recommendations on future action for each 
    site visited;

-   expert advice on the preservation of buildings of 
    particular historic significance;

-   selection of a small number of bases or huts which 
    could be suitable for designation as Historic 
    Monuments, with recommendations as to how they 
    could be best conserved.

FUTURE CLEAN-UP AND CONSERVATION ACTION

So far the BAS action plan has concentrated on clean-up, 
involving the removal of hazardous wastes, fuel and litter at 
targeted bases. This programme will continue.

The next stage will prepare action plans on the future 
management of each of the abandoned bases or huts, which will 
consider preservation as well as clean-up.  The report of the 
1994 Conservation Survey will be a valuable contribution to 
these assessments.  Further, more detailed structural and 
conservation surveys may be considered necessary.

Should any of the abandoned British bases or huts be eventually 
designated as Historic Monuments, the UK Government will be 
under a legal obligation under the Antarctic Treaty to ensure 
that they are kept in good repair.  The dismantlement and 
demolition of buildings raises complex management issues and new 
costs which will require the careful attention of BAS, the 
Government of the BAT and the UKAHT.  It is hoped that the UKAHT 
will be able to raise sufficient funds to enable it to 
contribute significantly to the restoration and maintenance 
costs of buildings designated as Historic Monuments.
