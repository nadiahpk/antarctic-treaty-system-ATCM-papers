RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ANTARCTIC TOURISM

Scale of tourist activity during the 1992/93 season

Antarctic tourism is evolving at an ever-increasing pace. More than 7,000 tourists, a record number, entered the Antarctic Treaty Area (south of 60° S latitude) during the 1992/93 season (Fig 1); 6,983 aboard ships (Table 1), 54 on yachts and 185 aboard aircraft.1 This represents an increase of more than 11% over the previous season's record high of 6,946 tourists in the Antarctic.2

●     Although the Antarctic tourism industry was once characterised by small expedition-sized vessels, 50% of Antarctic cruise passengers travelled aboard ships with a capacity of 250 or more during the 1992/93 season. Twelve cruise ships carried 6,933 passengers aboard a total of 63 Antarctic cruises during the 1992/93 season; 57 cruises were made to the Antarctic Peninsula, six cruises were offered to East Antarctica and the Ross Sea region. In comparison, a total of 49 trips were made by 10 cruise ships during the 1991/92 season.3 The remaining shipborne tourists during the 1992/93 season travelled aboard Chilean Navy vessels. Commercial aircraft carried passengers to the interior for mountain climbing trips and visits to the geographic South Pole4 and Twin Otter flights offered by Aérovias DAP of Punta Arenas brought tourists to Chile's Teniente Rodolfo Marsh Station on King George Island.5

●     The number of tourists that have visited the Antarctic now exceeds 52,0006; with 50,710 seaborne tourists comprising more than 96% of them7 (Table 2). More than a third of this total travelled to the Antarctic during the past three seasons; of these, more than 97% arrived aboard cruise ships or yachts.8 These figures do not include more than 11,000 tourists aboard aircraft overflying Antarctica who never set foot on the continent.9

dhe/319.2                                     /A
A total of 2,858 berths went unused during the 1992/93 season; 
on average,  cruise ships travelled 70% full (Table 1).  Had all 
cruises been fully booked, nearly 10,000 passengers would have 
visited the Antarctic. Nine of the 12 cruise ships were 
operated by members of the International Association of 
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), representing 51 of the 63 
available cruises.  Five tour companies that were not IAATO 
members brought 1,935 passengers on 12 cruises.  In all, 72% of 
cruise ship passengers were carried by members of IAATO, a 
notable decrease from the 1991/92 season when members carried 
85% (5,209) of cruise ship tourists.10

At least ten yachts visited the Antarctic during the 1992/93 
season (Table 3); nine visited the Antarctic Peninsula and at 
least five carried fare-paying passengers.  Greenpeace chartered 
a yacht for the season to conduct inspections in the Peninsula 
region.  Having previously used a ship for this purpose, the 
move represented considerable savings and a yacht charter was 
planned for inspection purposes again during the 1993/94 season, 
but was later cancelled.  The yacht "Oviri" planned to over-
winter in the Peninsula in the vicinity of Faraday Station.11

Significant trends

Fifty per cent of cruise passengers (3,447) travelled aboard 
ships with a capacity of 250 or more during the 1992/93 season; 
up from 44% (2,717 passengers) during the 1991/92 season.12

The number of Antarctic tour operators continues to increase.  
At least 12 tour operators brought tourists to the Antarctic 
during the 1992/93 season compared with ten operators during the 
1991/92 season and five during the 1990/91 season.13  Five 
cruise operators not known to have previous Antarctic experience 
brought 28% of cruise passengers (1,686) to Antarctica during 
the 1991/92 season.  Four of these operators did not return 
during the 1992/93 season.  Two of the companies changed 
/ownership

dhe/319.3
ownership and re-formed under three different operators that each returned during the 1992/93 season.  The five cruise operators in the Antarctic for the first time during the 1992/93 season brought a total of 2,694 tourists (30% of all cruise passengers) aboard 27 cruises. Three of these operators hired a majority of staff with previous Antarctic experience.

The increased number of European operators in Antarctica noted during the 1991/92 season14 was sustained during the 1992/93 season when at least five cruise operators carried 2,546 passengers, the majority of whom were European. Other cruise ships also carried Europeans, but precise data on the nationalities of passengers are difficult to obtain.

 
Tourist landings in the Antarctic Treaty Area

As annual tourist, tour operator, cruise and cruise ship totals increase, so do the number of landing sites used for tour visits. Under Antarctic Treaty Recommendation VIII-9, Annex C, tour organisers are to report, among other things, the number of tourists on each cruise as well as places and dates at which landings were made in the Antarctic Treaty Area, with the number of persons landed on each occasion.15 The six cruise operators based in the US that were required to report to NSF carried 57% of all cruise ship passengers (3,969) during the 1992/93 season. Five of these operators reported information covering 2,915 (73%) of these passengers; the one operator that did not report carried 27% of these tourists. Many visits made by operators based outside the US also went unreported. A substantial amount of information on landed passengers therefore remains unknown. Some operators may not report all the actual Antarctic landing sites used since, in their view, a competitive edge is gained by not revealing the locations of sites unknown to other operators.

As of July 1993, data compiled by the US National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs indicated that tourists
/travelling

dhe/319.4
travelling with the operators who reported their activities to 
NSF in accordance with Antarctic Treaty Recommendation VIII-9, 
landed at 51 sites in the Antarctic Peninsula area during the 
1992/93 season; inflatable boat cruising trips were made in 
waters adjacent to 7 of these landing sites in addition to 7 
other areas used only for boat cruising.16  For the operators 
that reported to NSF, the site visited by the most passengers 
during the 1992/93 season was Port Lockroy, Wiencke Island, 
22 times by 2,139 visitors17  (Table 4).  The site visited 
most often by tour operators that reported to NSF was 
Cuverville Island, visited 25 times by 1,589 visitors.18  This 
popular tourist landing site served as the base for a research 
team from Project Antarctic Conservation, based at the Scott 
Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge,19  that 
monitored the effects of tour visits on the environment and 
considered different visitor management techniques that might be 
applied to the site.  Researchers on Cuverville recorded 2,094 
landed passengers from 26 cruises and two yacht trips from 
7 December 1992 to 3 March 1993.  An additional 420 passengers 
did not land, but cruised the surrounding area in inflatable 
boats.20

Cruise ships differ in the number of Antarctic landings made 
per trip.  Some examples during the 1992/93 season include: 
(1) "Explorer":  11-day cruise, 9 landings; (2) 
"Kapitan Khlebnikov":  27-day cruise, 8 landings; and  (3) 
"Professor Molchanov":  12-day cruise, 11 landings.21  The 
number of landings made depends upon sea, ice and weather 
conditions, cruise itinerary and duration and the number of 
passengers carried, among other things.  For example, larger 
vessels with more passengers may make fewer landings per day but 
may spend more days in the Antarctic than some smaller ships, 
whilst the length of time different sized ships spend at landing 
sites also varies considerably.

To date, each national Antarctic programme determines its own 
tour visit policy; some strictly limit the number of tour ship 
/visits

dhe/319.5
visits to their respective stations each season given the 
limited window of opportunity to conduct research each austral 
summer, the careful planning of logistics needed to stage cargo 
and deliver science and support personnel, and increasing 
pressure on Antarctic programme planners to account for budgets, 
productivity and all aspects of operations, especially those 
involving safety and the environment.22 Poland's Arctowski 
station on King George Island appears to be the most heavily 
visited base in the Antarctic. During the 1992/93 season the 
station log-book listed 32 visits from cruise ships from a total 
of 63 cruises available that season. Two cruise ships landed 
crew only; all visits were made from 20 November 1992 to 
21 February 1993. During the same period, Arctowski was also 
visited twice by yachts and four times by Chilean military ships 
carrying tourists, in addition to ship visits associated with 
station operations or representing other national Antarctic 
programmes.

Recent developments

One cruise ship operator landed twelve passengers for an over-
night ashore at Waterboat Point on the Antarctic Peninsula in 
February 1993.23 It is not known whether or to what extent this 
practice will continue. In November 1993, a DC-6 aircraft 
chartered for use by a private expedition in Antarctica crashed 
several miles from the Patriot Hills Camp (80o S) near the 
Ellsworth Mountains. At least one passenger was seriously 
injured. All those aboard were evacuated by Adventure Network 
International (ANI), an airborne tour operator and member of 
IAATO, although ANI was not under contract to the expedition at 
the time.

Another development arose during the 1992/93 season when one 
cruise operator, new to the Antarctic, offered trips, including 
return airfare, for $2,950 US plus port fees and tax. These 
comparatively low-priced trips provided Antarctic travel 
/opportunities
dhe/319.6
opportunities to even greater numbers of people. Although it is 
not yet known how Antarctic tourism demographics may be affected 
by offering lower priced trips, if younger passengers visit the 
Antarctic in greater numbers there may well arise an increased 
demand for more adventurous activities when landed. Typical 
prices for an Antarctic cruise, including international airfare, 
however, remain between $6,000 and $9,000 US.

Of the tour operators based in the US that reported their plans 
for the 1993/94 season to the US Government as required under 
Treaty provisions, the average number of days a cruise planned 
to spend in the Antarctic Treaty Area was 6.8; this figure 
includes one ship operator that planned to visit for two days 
("Sagafjord") and several trips that planned to spend 15 
("Marco Polo"), 16 ("Explorer") and 21 ("Kapitan Khlebnikov") 
days in the Treaty Area, respectively.24 NSF estimated more 
than 8,000 cruise ship tourists will visit Antarctica during the 
1993/94 season.25 If the figure proves true and some tour 
prices fall, further substantial growth in Antarctic tourism 
would result.

More itinerary choices are now available to Antarctic tourists 
and an increasing number of sites are being visited.26  One 
significant development during the 1992/93 season was the 
introduction of tourist helicopter flights into Antarctica's 
Dry Valleys, Victoria Land.  Although science programmes have 
used helicopters in the area for many years, tourists had never 
before been taken to this part of the Antarctic. The first 
tourist cruise to the Weddell Sea was made during the 1993/94 
season.  Helicopter tours for the trip were made in an area the 
tour operator had never visited.

Conclusions

A record number of tourists visited the Antarctic during the 
1992/93 season; recent developments indicate tourist numbers are 
/likely

dhe/319.7
likely to continue to grow. The face of Antarctic tourism is 
changing. With these changes come new challenges for Antarctic 
policy makers. New operators are entering the market, often 
with little or no experience of the area, resulting in an 
increased number of passengers carried aboard such ships. The 
days when only a handful of operators brought tourists to the 
Antarctic aboard expedition-sized vessels appear to have ended. 
Small ships must now compete with larger counterparts that often 
offer lower fares due to overhead costs shared out over a larger 
client base. Given the recent trend toward larger cruise ships 
in the Antarctic, some ships may not be eligible to join IAATO, 
considering their current membership rules and, therefore, would 
not benefit from the advantages membership brings, namely access 
to important information relevant to conducting environmentally 
responsible tours. Tourists are visiting more Antarctic landing 
sites than ever before. Cruise passengers have camped overnight 
ashore in Antarctica. More tourist markets are opening up; an 
increasing number of Europeans are visiting Antarctica. Heli-
copter flights and tourist landings at previously unvisited 
areas offered by some operators raise questions about the 
current practice of allowing tour operators to decide for them-
selves what areas are to be visited, especially where the 
intrinsic scientific value and environmental risks may not yet 
be known. One tour operator is understood to be preparing an 
Environmental Impact Assessment, in line with Annex I of the 
Protocol, of their activities.

NB:  These Figures do not include Antarctic landings made by all 
cruise ships during either season since some operators did not 
report back to NSF and others are not required to do so since 
they are based outside of the US.  Sources: NSF29; NSF, Ref 16;
