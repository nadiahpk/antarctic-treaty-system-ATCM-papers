IAATO REPORT OF ACTIVITIES FOR XVIII ATCM-Kyoto

The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities for the XVIII ATCM-Kyoto, April 1994.

At present 12 companies are members of IAATO:  9 are U.S.-based, 1 is Canadian (with a U.S. sales office), and 2 are German.  Other companies have applied or have inquired about membership, and are expected to become members prior to the beginning of the 1994-95 summer season in Antarctica.  A list of member companies is at the end of this report.

IAATO's members strongly believe that the ultimate protection and conservation of Antarctica will largely depend on sound policy to which all Treaty nations adhere.  In order to achieve the highest quality of environmental practices among tour operators, IAATO invites new operators to become members and thus adopt an industry-generated Code of Conduct (Visitor and Tour Operator Guidelines) so that all are conducting tourism in an equivalent and environmentally responsible manner.  A copy of the IAATO Bylaws, Article II. Objectives, is given at the end of this report.

During the last two austral summer seasons, tourism was carried out by the widest range of vessels used to date, including private yachts, ice-strengthened expedition ships, non-strengthened cruise ships, and icebreakers.  Airborne tourism has
1
only slightly added to the total counts of tourists--more than 90 
percent of tourists have visited Antarctica by ship.  Although 
tourism has grown from year to year, especially since 1986, in 
the 35 years since tourists first visited Antarctica, the 
cumulative total number is still less than the number of tourists 
who have -- in one year!-- visited the Galapagos Islands, 
considered to be one of the most fragile and sensitive ecosystems 
in the world.

● The total annual number of tourists (6,500 to 7,000) that have 
visited Antarctica recently is comparable to the total number of 
all scientists and support staff at all stations and field camps 
in summer.  Major differences, however, between human presence of 
tourists and that of science programs is that (1) tourism 
operates only in the 4-month summer period, and (2) there are no 
shore or land facilities (stations) for tourism.  With the 
exception of the IAATO member company that operates airborne 
tourism, involving perhaps a total of 125 individuals at various 
times and operating from a temporary summer camp in the interior, 
nearly all of the annual tourist population is ship-based--that 
is, the ship is the "hotel," or "station," and there is no 
permanent land facility.  Another way of stating this is that 
the "residence time" of tourists actually setting foot on land 
is less than 1% of that of all others (i.e. science programs) on 
the continent.

● In addition to publicizing IAATO-generated Guidelines of 
Conduct for passengers and tour operators, IAATO has also 
prepared a list of pertinent contact information for each ship 
operated by IAATO members in Antarctica.  By distributing the 
list among members and encouraging co-operation among operators, 
ship operators are able to communicate while in the field, 
thereby ensuring that itineraries and shore visits can be planned 
without encountering other ships, or overburdening the carrying 
capacity of a single site.  Members pledge that not more than 100

2
individuals be placed ashore at any one time. The contact 
information is also vital in the event of emergencies. This 
"Ship Call Data" Form for the 1993-94 season is included at the 
end of this report.

IAATO hopes that its voluntary Guidelines will be replaced by a 
comparable version as a result of the XVIII ATCM-Kyoto. The new 
version would be adopted for future use by IAATO members.

Within the last year Quark Expeditions and Adventure Network 
International (both members of IAATO) produced an Environmental 
Audit of their operations, presented at the XVIII ATCM-Kyoto as 
Information Papers 13 and 23, respectively. These evaluations 
were produced voluntarily by the companies as a means of 
assessing operations, and determining whether any potential 
environmental problems might be revealed, and corrective measures 
undertaken. This precedent in the industry has provided a 
stimulus for all IAATO members to have independent, unbiased 
audits and assessments to be conducted. In addition, this 
introspective exercise will provide valuable experience to be 
used in the anticipation of environmental evaluations that may be 
required by parties as a result of the 1991 Environmental 
Protocol.

DATA GATHERING AND STATISTICS

In order to document tourism activities, and numbers of 
tourists and trends, an appropriate data base must be developed. 
A number of formats have been used in the last few years, and 
others may result from ratification of the Protocol. A draft 
example of a form which provides details of site visits and an 
individual tour is shown at the end of this report. This version 
is still in draft form (and therefore unofficial), and is a 
result of efforts by the Council of Managers of National 
Antarctic Programs (COMNAP), in concert with IAATO, to provide a 
3
standard format for reporting of tourist and expeditionary travel 
in Antarctica.  A comparable version in final form is expected 
to be in use for the 1994-95 summer season. These standard 
formats will be valuable in analyzing tourism in the Antarctic.

Plans for establishing a central clearing house to receive and 
distribute such information is under discussion.

ANCILLARY BENEFITS OF TOURISM

1.  For many years, national ATP programs have availed 
themselves of tour ships to transport field personnel and 
equipment to various locations in Antarctica, on a space-
available basis on the ships. All involved in this procedure 
benefit, inasmuch as the scientists often present lectures to 
passengers on the ships as part of the on board educational 
programs.

2.  Several instances arose recently (1992-93 season) in which a 
Russian icebreaker, chartered for tourist cruises, cleared 
harbors of sea ice adjacent to several stations along the coast 
of East Antarctica, thus providing access for supply ships 
expected shortly after.

3.  Beginning in the 1994-95 season, tour ships will participate 
in a program of Volunteer Observing Ships Scheme for 
meteorological and related data, a proposal raised by the WMO 
Representative at the XVIII ATCM-Kyoto (Information Paper 25). 
Tour ships will assist in this program by recording synoptic 
measurements of air and sea temperatures, wind speed, barometric 
pressure, sea state, ice conditions, etc., and relaying the data 
to a central office for general availability.  Tour ships often 
include unusual and remote locations and routes in their 
itineraries, many of them not traveled by ATP ships, and the 
resulting information from the Voluntary Observing Ships Scheme 
4
will be of great benefit to a better understanding of Antarctic 
weather systems, as well as providing immediate information for 
ATP and other ships in routine transport.

REFERENCE VOLUME ON 'ANTARCTIC TOURISM'

Tour operators are pleased to see a recently published 
reference volume on "Antarctic Tourism," published by Pergamon 
Press in its "Annals of Tourism Research," as vol. 21, no. 2, 
1994. The volume consists of a collection of 12 chapters by 
specialists in Antarctic tourism, plus two short research notes. 
This publication provides a state-of-the-art document on tourism, 
and includes a wealth of information on various aspects of the 
industry, including visits to stations, and sub-Antarctic 
islands.

HISTORY AND FUTURE OF IAATO

In 1991, the six active ship tour operators, plus Adventure 
Network International, founded IAATO as a means of pooling 
resources and promoting thoughtful legislation that is compatible 
with the responsible tourism that tour operators have exhibited 
in their history. Members pledge to abide by the U.S. Antarctic 
Conservation Act of 1978, or its equivalent in the newly signed 
1991 Environmental Protocol and Annexes, and to adhere to the 
industry-generated Guidelines of Conduct for Antarctica Visitors 
and Tour Operators.  In its short history, IAATO has provided 
sound environmental guidance for non-ATP sponsored visitors to 
Antarctica, and has enjoyed a good relationship with science 
programs.  As the IAATO objectives illustrate (below), it is 
hoped that this relationship will continue and Antarctica will 
remain as a pristine continent for all to enjoy.
