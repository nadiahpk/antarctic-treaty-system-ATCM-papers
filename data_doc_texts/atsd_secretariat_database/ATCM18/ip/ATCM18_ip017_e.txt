JEAN ROSTAND, ALEXIS CARREL, CLAUDE BERNARD ISLANDS,
BON DOCTEUR NUNATAK AND MARINE EMPEROR PENGUINS BREEDING COLONY.

1. DESCRIPTION OF VALUES TO BE PROTECTED

●	The area hosts various fauna species : Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) ; Antarctic skua (Catharacta maccormicki) ; Adelie penguin (pygoscelis adeliae) ; Wilson storm's petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) ; Southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) ; snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) ; Cape petrel (Daption capensis) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli).

	The designation is expected to safeguard the association of these different species harboured in the area, which therefore constitutes one of the most representatives for both faunistic an scientific interest on Adelie coast.

	Long-term research and monitoring programmes have been continuing a long time already (since 1952 or 1964 according to the species). A data base implemented in 1981 is directed by C.E.B.C. (Centre d'Etudes biologiques de Chizé).

	Ethological, ecological, physiological and biochemical programmes in progress should be carried on, especially those related to demographic monitoring and impact assessment of surrounding human activities.

●	Physiology and biochemistry programmes relating to fasting mecanisms and thermogenesis of emperor penguins could be pursued in compliance with permit provisions.

	In the same way, the ongoing geology programme could continue with a particular attention to the programmation of visits especially when thermomecanical means for sampling are required.

	The Emperor penguins breeding colony is a site of special scientific interest which could further be included in the Convention on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Environmental Monitoring Programme (CCAMLR/CEMP) in order to achieve the Convention requirements.

2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

The growing flux of cruising tourist ships requires an adequate management of activities with a special attention to environmental consequences and assessment needs. Also, the opening of Dumont d'Urville airstrip, with restrictive conditions of use and flights limited to a short period of time, with a prohibition of large aircraft from november to late january, will make necessary careful attention to environnement together with permanent fauna monitoring.

The management plan is therefore designed to produce the adequate policy rules inside the area and to state a permit system suitable for compelling scientific activities.

3. MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

The plan is kept under review to ensure that the values of the area are wholly protected.

Inspection visits are restricted to essential management purposes.

4. PERIOD OF DESIGNATION

The area is designed as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area for an indefinite period.

5. DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA

a) Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features.

Jean ROSTAND, Alexis CARREL, Claude BERNARD islands, Bon Docteur Nunatak and Emperor penguins breeding colony are situated in the heart of Pointe-Géologie Archipelago, coastal area of Adelie Land ( 140 to 140°02'E ; 66°39'30" to 66°40'30"S)

The area consists of the southernmost rock exposure of the Pointe Géologie archipelago, between the Petrels island and the western edge of the Astrolabe glacier. It is a very large ice free ground within Adelie Land.

As a whole, the surface of the outcropping rocks do not exceed 2 square kilometers. The highest points are distributed along NE-SW ridges (Cl. Bernard Island : 47.6 m ; J.B. Lamarck Island : 22.2 m ; J. Rostand Island : 36.39 m ; Carrel Island : 28.24 m and Nunatak : 28.50 m). These well-marked hills display assymetrical transverse profiles with gently dipping northern slopes compared to the steeper southern ones. The terrain is affected by a lot of cracks and fractures leading to very rough surfaces. The basement rocks mainly consit of sillimanite, cordierite and garnet-rich gneisses which are intruded by abundant dikes of pink anatexites. The lowest parts of the islands are covered by morainic boulders (few centimeters to more than a meter accross).

During the summer, only the northern flanks of the islands are still covered by compressed snow caps.

There are no boundary markers since natural features delimit the wholly protected islands.

However, markers could further be set up in Nunatak.

b) Access to the area.

Access to the area is authorized on conditions stated by the permit system (see § 8).

c) Location of structures in the area.

Prevost historic hut and a shelter take place in ROSTAND island. There are no other building 
anywhere else in the area.

d) Location in or near the area of other "Antarctic Specially Protected Areas" or "Antarctic 
Specially Managed Areas".

This area is located within an "Antarctic Specially Managed Area" (ASMA) icluding Dumont 
d'Urville station and other surrounding areas of activities.

●

6. IDENTIEIFCATION OF RESTRICTED OR PROHIBITED ZONES

Access to every part of the area is prohibited unless authorized by a permit.

7. MAPS

The map shows location of each island and other zones of the area inside Pointe-Géologie 
Archipelago.

8. CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PERMITS MAY BE GRANTED.

a) Access to and movement within the area.

No helicopters, nor terrestrial vehicles are authorized either to access or within the area. No 
overflight all over the area, either by helicopters or other aeroplanes are authorized referring to the 
provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation of Dome C relating to air movement 
restrictions and to the recommandations defining helicopters routes in the Archipelago 
(recommandations annexed in the above-mentioned ASMA management plan).

Access to the area is therefore only permitted by foot or by zodiacs (in summer).

However, very rare departures of terrestrial vehicles from Nunatak could be allowed, only when sea 
ice conditions hinder from proceeding otherwise and with a special attention to the presence of birds 
in the area.

No tracks or roads exist in the area. None will be allowed during period of designation.

Access to and movement within the area shall, in any case, be limited and vigilant in order to avoid 
unnacessary disturbance to birds, especially by crossing their pathways, and to ensure that breeding 
areas or their access are not damaged nor endangered.
- 4 -

b) Activities which are, or may be, conducted within the area, including restrictions on time and place.

Visitors granted entry in the area by a permit shall ensure that no disturbance will occur from their visits to monitoring programmes.

Permits are delivered only for compelling scientific activities which cannot be conducted elsewhere, and for necessary management activities.

Access to the breeding area of emperor penguins is forbidden except in the case of a permit delivered for specific scientific purposes needing to operate in the colony and for a limited number of persons including an experienced ornithologist.

The emperor penguins colony is particularly sensitive when incubating eggs from mid-May to mid-July and when feeding chicks from mid-July to mid-December when the chicks fledge. Emperor penguins are equally protected beyond the defined limits of their breeding area, since the colony is not always located exactly at the same place. Any other permit holder in the area is not allowed to approach or to disturb the colony in any manner.

The same provisions shall apply for the fragile southern giant petrels.

c) The installation, modification or removal of structures.

No new structures, nor field huts or camps will be allowed during the period of designation.

d) The location of field camps.

See (c) above.

e) Restriction on materials and organisms which may be brought into the area.

No depots of food or other supplies are to be left within the area.

Poultry products including dried food or egg powder are not to be brought in the area.

Fuel is not to be depoted in the area, except for scientific purposes as specified in permit.

f) The taking of or harmful interference with nature flora and fauna.

Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna is forbidden unless specifically authorized in permit in compliance with Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Fauna and Flora, or article 3 of Annex II to the Madrid Protocol.

All experiments on animals shall be carried out in respect with the SCAR Code of Conduct on Ethics of Animal Experimentation in Antarctica, as a minimal standard.

g) The collection or removal of anything not brought into the area by the permit holder.

Collection or removal of anything not brought into the area by a permit holder is prohibited unless specified in permit for scientific or management purposes.
- 5 -

h) The disposal of waste.

No wastes including human wastes are to be left in the area.

i) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met.

Permits shall specify the maximum number of persons allowed entry at any one time.

Visits to the area should be kept to the minimum necessary to achieve the scientific and management objectives.

j) Requirements for reports of visits to the area.

Each visitor shall submit a report to the permit issuing authority as soon as possible after the visit to the area. This report will include detailed informations on activities undertaken within the area, comments about measures taken to comply with the management plan requirements and possible recommandations relevant to the management of the area, especially to ensure that the values for which the area has been designated continue to be adequately protected.
