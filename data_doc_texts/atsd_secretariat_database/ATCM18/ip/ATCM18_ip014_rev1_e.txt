SITE DESCRIPTION FOR SSSI 25, MARINE PLAIN, VESTFOLD HILLS,
PRINCESS ELIZABETH LAND

Australia advises delegations of corrections to the site description included in the Management Plan for SSI 25, Marine Plain, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, which are necessary following the discovery of inconsistencies in the original site description. The areas requiring amendment are shown below in bold type:

**Physical Features**

-   Under this heading the opening sentence reads "Marine Plain (23.4 km,  lat. 68°.38'S, long. 78°08'E)....". This should read:

      "Marine Plain (23.4 km2, lat. 68°38'S, long. 78°08'E) ....".

-   The boundary of the site as defined in the second paragraph under this heading should read:

      ".....commencing at lat. 68°36'30"S, long. 78°09'00"E it runs south easterly to lat. 68°36'45"S, long. 78°10'30"E; then south-easterly to lat. 68°37'30"S, long. 78°12'30"E, then south along the meridian of long. 78°12'30"E to its intersection by the low water mark ......".

**Topography**

-   The penultimate sentence under this heading requires the following alteration:

      "....by a marked change in their slope, probably representing an old (Holocene?) shoreline."

**Geology**

-   The third sentence under this heading should read:

      "Low lying areas consist of at least 8 metres of early Pliocene .....".

The changes do not have any effect on the management plan as such, they are merely to rectify errors in the original site description.
