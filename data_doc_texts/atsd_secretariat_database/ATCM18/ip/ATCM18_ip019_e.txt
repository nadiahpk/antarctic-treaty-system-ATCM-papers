REPORT BY THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO) IN
RELATION TO ARTICLE III(2) OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
(Submitted by World Meteorological Organization)
Report by WMO in relation to Article III(2) of the Antarctic Treaty

Since XVII ATCM WMO activities relation to Antarctica have been as follows:

WMO Executive Council considered Antarctic matters at its meeting in June 1992 and inter alia
-urged its Members to continue monitoring and research into the depletion of Antarctic stratospheric ozone, and to carry out continuous associated measurement of atmospheric composition.
-established closer links with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission(IOC) for the development of co-ordinated plans for WMO-IOC co-operation in research and monitoring of the Southern Ocean.
-noted the views of XVII ATCM on marine hydrometeorological services for the Southern Ocean and urged further co-operation between WMO and COMNAP in developing improved meteorological and ice information services in the region, and
-supported the representation of WMO at future ATCM and SCAR meetings.

The WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology(EC-WGAM) held its 6th Session in November 1993. Its published report provides information on:
-The basic synoptic network for the Antarctic and its further development.
-The present state and future development of telecommunications in the region.
-The organisation of an International Program for Antarctic Buoys.
-The meteorological service functions in Antarctica currently provided from Casey, Marambio, McMurdo, Molodeznaya and Frei.
-The draft WMO fourth long-term plan for Antarctica (1996-2005).
-Plans for the improvement of ozone measurements in Antarctica.
-Plans for an ongoing annual exchange of information on national Antarctic meteorological programmes.
-Plans for an assembly of information on national holdings of historical Antarctic data.

Information papers will be circulated on specific matters which may assist XVIII ATCM in consideration of Agenda Items 14 and 15.
