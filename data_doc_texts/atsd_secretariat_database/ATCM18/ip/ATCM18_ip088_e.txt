THE ORGANISATION OF THE CENTRE TO SUPPORT OF THE ANTARCTIC 
MARINE POLLUTION RESPONCE OPERATIONS.

Agenda Items 6, 12, 14, 15.

Noting the importance attached by the parties to the Antarctic 
Treaty to the prevention of pollution of the Antarctic environment,
Taking into consideration that the implementation of the Madrid Protocol 
provides for the elaboration of marine pollution contingency response 
plan, Taking into consideration that the WMO in conjunction with IMO and 
IOC has approved the initiative of creating special centers for prompt 
support of marine pollution liquidation, using technologies of the new 
Global Marine Distress Safety System (GMDSS),

Recognizing that an accident in Antartica resulted in marine 
pollution may have negative global consequence,

Taking into consideration the spirit of cooperation of 
Antarctic Treaty parties,

The Russian delegation proposes to cooperate efforts of 
countries-parties in creating of the united special center to 
provide information assistance in the marine pollution response 
operations taking place in the Antarctic waters in cooperation 
with the WMO, IOC, IMO.

1
The Center should not be a permanent base organization but 
in case of an accident in the Antarctic waters in one of the 
oceanographical or meteorological institutes or bureaux of one 
of the countries there should be a prompt response plan as well 
as technical and other means like

-   computer technologies to estimate the motion and transformation 
    of the oil spill depending on the external conditions, 
    appropriate data bank of

-   access to operations data and to products distributed by Global 
    Telecommunication System WMO,

-   communication facilities with ships (INMARSAT terminal),

-   well-educated personnel to act in case of emergency signal.

We are realizing that the organization of such a center is 
a complicated task which would take a lot of time, but under 
increasing of scientific and tourism activity these measures 
should not be put off for long.

Russia on its part is ready to take part in the 
organization of the Center by sending an experienced 
specialists to prepare technical proposals and appropriate 
technological decisions within the working group which is 
probably to be arranged.

We also think it to be important to raise this question 
already today , so that by the next ATCM meeting to be held in 
Seoul the countries parties to Antarctic Treaty could consult 
their marine and meteorological services to determine the 
location of the proposed Center.
