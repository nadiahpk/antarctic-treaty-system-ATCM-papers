PROVISIONS OF ANNEX IV OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY IN COMPARISON TO THOSE 
OF MARPOL 73/78 (AS AMENDED)

Article 1.

1.      The definitions in this Article track MARPOL closely. 
        Although they are at times abbreviated, there are no 
        inconsistencies with MARPOL.

2.      The definition of noxious liquid substance (Article 1(d) 
        refers directly to MARPOL Annex II which, in turn refers only to 
        such substances when carried in bulk (see also the reference to 
        Article 4 below).

Article 2.

3.      The application of this Article to 'any other ship engaged 
        in or supporting its Antarctic operations, while operating in 
        the Antarctic Treaty Area' could readily be addressed by permits 
        issued to expedition organisers.

Article 3.

4.      The Special Area provisions of Annex I of MARPOL prohibit 
        any discharge of oil or oily mixtures into Antarctic waters. 
        Article 3 follows very closely the provisions set out in MARPOL 
        and Article 3(2) parallels MARPOL exceptions to the blanket 
        prohibition on the discharge of oil.

Article 4.

5.      Noxious liquid substances are defined in Article 1(d) of 
        Annex IV by reference to Annex II of MARPOL 73/78, which applies 
        only to such substances carried in bulk. Although the drafting 
        is poor, it was the intention of the drafters of the Protocol

/that
mgr/745a.1 (revised)                                      - 3 -
that Article 4 should not solely apply to substances carried in 
bulk. Whilst bulk chemical vessels are not usually present in 
Antarctic waters, a number of the noxious liquid substances 
listed in Appendix II of Annex II of MARPOL, and other chemicals 
and substances, are used within the Antarctic Treaty Area, 
though in smaller (ie not bulk) quantities. The discharge of 
such substances or chemicals, under certain conditions, could 
give rise to adverse impacts on the marine environment. 
Article 4 of Annex IV therefore goes further than MARPOL (a) in 
prohibiting, in addition, the discharge of any substance or 
chemical not carried in bulk but in quantities or concentrations 
that are harmful to the marine environment, and (b) such 
discharge is not explicitly tied to a discharge into the marine 
environment from a ship but would also cover a discharge from a 
land-based source, eg a research station.

6. The Special Area provisions of Annex II of MARPOL do not 
extend to the Antarctic, but are confined to the Baltic and 
Black Sea areas.

7. The DTP have pointed out that there is no provision in 
Article 4 for the discharge of noxious liquid substances 
resulting from damage to a ship or its equipment. In retrospect 
it might have been better if Article 4 had contained wording 
parallel to Regulation 6(b) (Annex II) of MARPOL in the same way 
that Articles 3(2) and 5(5) of Annex IV provide exemptions for 
the discharge of oil and garbage respectively. But, serious 
damage to a ship, sufficient to impair its safety at sea and 
which constitutes an emergency, is within Article 7 of Annex IV, 
which permits the necessary discharge of any of the materials 
dealt with by Annex IV (oil, noxious substances, garbage or 
sewage). A similar omission is evident in Article 6 in relation 
to the discharge of sewage resulting from damage to a ship or 
its equipment even though, as the DTP point out, the MARPOL 
regulations do once again contain exemption provisions in 
Annex IV, Regulation 9(b).

mgr/745a.2 (revised)                  /8.
- 4 -
8. The question is whether it was the intention of drafters deliberately to distinguish between the exemptions for damage provided for oil and garbage and the lack of such provisions for noxious substances and sewage.  My belief is that it was not and that in the [undue] haste of redrafting this Annex at Madrid II, language parallelling Articles 3(2) and 5(5) was unfortunately omitted from Articles 4 and 6.

9. In retrospect, exemption language relating to damage might more appropriately have been included in Article 7 to deal with all discharges under Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6.

10. I believe we should take the view that, the ability to discharge substances dealt with by Article 4 (noxious substances etc) and Article 6 (sewage), following damage to a ship or its equipment, is a specific right under MARPOL and therefore preserved by the terms of Article 14 of Annex IV.

11. Incidentally, although wording in the second part of Article 4 is very similar to that of Regulation 10(4)(a) of Annex I of MARPOL, the reference there to 'no discharge into the sea shall contain chemicals or other substances in quantities or concentrations which are hazardous to the marine environment .... etc' relates to such chemicals or substances being part of a discharge of oil or oily waste and does not cover the more general discharge situation.

Article 5.

12. The definition of garbage in Article 5(1) of Annex IV is almost identical to that provided in MARPOL 73/78 (Regulation 5 of Annex V). The exception is the inclusion of 'incineration ash'. This, if I recall, was specifically added to address the problems of disposing of the waste products from on-board incinerators. The DTP will need to tell us whether this type of garbage can be added to the prohibited list under existing legislation, or whether a new provision will need to be made.

mgr/745a.3 (revised)      /13.
- 5 -
13. Article 5(3) prohibits the discharge of food wastes within 
12 miles of land or ice-shelves, and requires that outside this 
area food waste be passed through a comminutor or grinder such 
that it can be capable of passing through a screen with openings 
no greater than 25mm. This last provision is stronger than 
MARPOL though there appears to be an inconsistency in the MARPOL 
text in that whilst Regulation 3(1)(c) of Annex V requires food 
wastes to be comminuted or ground for disposal outside Special 
Areas, there is no similar provision for inside Special Areas, 
(see Regulation 5(2)(b)), whilst sub-para (c) mentions 
comminution or grinding only in relation to the wider Caribbean 
region.

14. In other words, Article 5(3) of Annex IV appears to be more 
onerous than Annex V of MARPOL. The DTP should advise whether 
suitable legislation is already in place to deal with this 
matter.

16. Article 5(4) is similar to Regulation 5(3) of Annex V of 
MARPOL, though the wording has been changed. The important 
change is that whereas MARPOL uses the term 'the more stringent 
requirements shall apply', Article 5(4) substitutes 'more' with 
'most'. It is unlikely, however, that this is a distinction 
with a difference.

mgr/745a.4 (revised)                                  /17.
                                                          - 6 -
17.Article 5(5) is comprehensively covered by MARPOL.

18.     MARPOL does not require the use of garbage record books 
       though it does indicate, under the Guidelines for the 
       implementation of Annex V (para 7.14, pg 468) that governments 
       should consider, where applicable, the use of garbage discharge 
       reporting systems, eg record books. Article 5(6) is written in 
       mandatory language and indeed we see benefit in vessels retro-
       grading materials from Antarctica to have a clear idea of the 
       materials being carried on-board so that port reception 
       facilities outside the Antarctic Treaty Area can be advised in 
       advance of the quantities and identifications of wastes to be 
       off-loaded. We should check with DTP whether there is already 
       a requirement for UK-flagged vessels to carry garbage record 
       books. If not, we should introduce the requirement as a 
       condition of the permit scheme. This would not cover ships 
       (such as fishing vessels) which will not usually require 
       permits. But this is probably unnecessary and, in terms of 
       Article 5(6), not "appropriate".

Article 6.

19.     This Article is based largely on Regulation 8(1)(a) of 
       MARPOL Annex IV, with the same discharge provisions relating to 
       untreated sewage outside 12 nautical miles from land (or ice-
       shelves). Article 6 is inconsistent with, and weaker than, 
       MARPOL in two regards:

       (a)    Article 6(1) contains the exception 'where it would 
              unduly impair Antarctic operations';

       (b)    Article 6(1)(a) makes no mention of the discharge of 
              treated sewage. MARPOL prohibits the discharge of 
              such sewage only within 4 nautical miles of land, the 
              Annex apparently does not.

- 7 -
21. Article 6(2) requires the use of sewage record books.
MARPOL does not.  Neither does it suggest the use of such books
under Guidelines for implementation.  Again we could write this
requirement into the permit scheme.

22. I have already highlighted the fact that MARPOL allows for
the discharge of sewage following damage to a ship, the Protocol
does not (see para 7 above).

Article 7.

23. This exemption reflects similar wording in separate MARPOL
Annexes.  Reports of incidents involving harmful substances (ie
all those subject to regulations) are required by MARPOL (see
para 3 of the Annex to Protocol I).

Article 8.

24. Although the term dependent and associated ecosystems,
outside the Antarctic Treaty Area has not been defined, this
Article appears adequately catered for in respect of the marine
ecosystem by the all embracing MARPOL requirement 'to prevent
the pollution of the marine environment' without specific regard
to the Antarctic Treaty Area.  Pollution of atmospheric and
terrestrial ecosystems are, of course, not covered by Annex IV,
nor by MARPOL.  Organisers of expeditions should be reminded of
this general requirement for due consideration within the
permit system.

Article 9.

25. This Article largely tracks the provisions of MARPOL.
There are, however, two deviations from MARPOL.  The first
/relates
mgr/745a.6 (revised)
- 8 -
relates to the extension of the Article's provisions to 'any 
other ship engaged in or supporting its Antarctic operations'. 
This issue can be dealt with through adequate contractual 
arrangements and permit conditions.

26. The second is found in the last sentence of Article 9(1) 
which extends the storage capacity requirements to the retention 
of noxious liquid substances. This appears to be curious in two 
respects:

    (i) because noxious liquid substances are by definition 
        such substances carried in bulk (see Article 1(d) of 
        Annex IV) and clearly a bulk tanker must by 
        implication have adequate tankage to carry its bulk 
        cargo;

    (ii) reference to storage requirements for other chemical 
         or other substances (not carried in bulk) has 
         inexplicably been omitted.

Again, these issues could be addressed through permit 
conditions.

27. The Protocol requires State Parties to provide facilities 
for the reception of oil, oily mixtures and garbage at ports 
en route to Antarctica. No mention is, however, made of noxious 
liquid substances, or other chemicals or substances.  This 
provision is mirrored by MARPOL language.  If these provisions 
are extended to the Falkland Islands, they will require the 
installation of costly new facilities.  At the insistence of the 
South American States concerned, the wording of Article 9(3) was 
inserted to the effect that 'the establishment of port reception 
facilities [would] not place an inequitable burden on Parties 
adjacent to the Antarctic Treaty Area'.  This apparent easing of 
the requirement for port reception facilities is not found in 
MARPOL and could, therefore, not be used as a defensible excuse 
by MARPOL Parties for non-compliance.

/Article 10.

mgr/745a.7 (revised)
- 9 -
Article 10.

28. I believe we can interpret this Article to reflect the 
separate design, construction, manning and equipment rules 
within the five Annexes of MARPOL.

Article 11.

29. This Article, and its implications for the implementation 
of much of Annex IV could be dealt with through administrative 
instructions to the Masters of State-owned vessels.

30. We are bound by the Protocol to inform other Parties of how 
we implement this provision. There is no similar requirement in 
MARPOL. Details of implementation can be provided in the Annual 
Exchanges of Information.

Article 12.

31. Under this Article oil-spill contingency plans are required 
to be drawn up for all ships (other than small boats that are 
part of the operation of fixes sites or of ships). This 
requirement is more onerous than MARPOL whose Regulation 26 of 
Annex I restricts the need for oil-spill contingency plans to 
oil tankers above 150 tonnes, and every other ship above 
400 tonnes gross tonnage. The DTP should be asked whether 
existing UK legislation will deal with this inconsistency.

Article 13.

32. The need for continuous review of this Annex is again more 
a matter for administrative practice.

Article 14.

33. It is not clear what constitutes a specific right under 
MARPOL (see para 10 above). The purpose of the Article is to 
ensure that the obligations of a Party to MARPOL is not lessened
/in
mgr/745a.8 (revised)
- 10 -
in respect of Antarctica by the Annex. Accordingly, it would 
seem that the Article presumes the right of any Party to MARPOL 
which is not specifically recognised in Annex IV.

Article 15.

34. This concerns only implementation of the Annex.

ANNEX 1.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF UPGRADED ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SYSTEM.

1. Existing AE installation

The alternative energy systems that were in use 
at World Park Base before the modifications 
were carried out at the beginning of 1991 
consisted of a 3 kW, 130 V DC wind generator 
and an array of solar panels installed on the 
satellite communications tower.

The energy they created went directly into a 
storage heater for heating the base, and into a 
battery bank for later retrieval via a 12 to 220 
volt inverter.

The wind generator was installed on a 12 metre 
high triangular mast sited approximately 20 
metres east of the main base building.

Daily average wind speeds at Cape Evans 
ranged from a low of eight knots in June to 13 
knots in April, and the average daily power 
output of the wind generator varied between 34.3 
kWh in April to 21 kWh during the month of 
June.

The solar panel array had a maximum output of 
600 W during the summer months.

2. Design strategy for AE upgrade

When it was decided to upgrade the alternative 
energy system, the project team considered:
      - energy generation;
      - energy usage;
      - energy storage;
      - energy distribution;
      - energy management;
      - energy conservation; and
      - restrictions imposed by the existing base 
structure.

After examining the load distribution of the base 
power demands over a 24 hour period it was 
concluded that:

      - it was possible to identify an invariant (base) 
load component in the daily load cycle;
      - it was reasonable to associate peak loads with 
the personnel's active period; and
      - a significant portion of the invariant (base) load 
was heating requirements.

The strategy chosen was:
      - to reduce the base electrical load through the 
use of kerosene heaters. This represented a 
more efficient use of fuel than electrical heating;
      - to supply the remaining base electrical load 
with the AE system, but only during the 
personnel's quiet period (i.e. the base would 
be put "to sleep" for approximately eight hours, 
when the diesel generators would be shut 
down).

3. Design considerations for new system

Design criteria not only included energy 
conservation and cost efficiency, but also 
utilisation of existing equipment, efficient and 
minimal use of space, safety to wildlife and the 
environment, safety to humans, ease of 
monitoring, and ease of troubleshooting.

The existing base electrical set up was a three 
phase, alternating current (AC) system. Any 
interfaces, load distribution schemes and load 
management systems needed to take this into 
account.

In practical terms the system had to fulfil the 
following power requirements:

Estimated load over eight hours "sleeping period"
Supply lighting               3.0 kWh
Supply heating              16.0 kWh
Supply power for emergency 
  radio operation and for 
  incoming Inmarsat calls     3.0 kWh
Diesel engine block heaters   2.0 kWh
Hydroponics pump             0.7 kWh
Exhaust fans                 2.0 kWh
Composting toilet            8.0 kWh
Freezers                     4.8 kWh
TV, VCR, computer            1.2 kWh
                                _______
Total                        40.7 kWh

The estimate of total energy requirement was 
considered to be generous, because:

      - Storage heaters would be the primary space 
heating units in the engine and radio rooms, 
which would be charged during the day by the 
diesel generators. The "supply heating" 
allocation would therefore only have to cope 
with back-up heating requirements. The 
engine block heater would normally not be 
used.

      - The freezers were located in the unheated 
lean-to. They were thermostatically controlled, 
and it was considered unlikely that they would 
run 24 hours a day, particularly in winter.

37
A more realistic estimate of the capacity required from an AE system was therefore about 31 kW.

4.    Required AE system capacity

Any AE system's capacity is a function of:
- the amount of excess power available to charge the storage system(s);
- the capacity of the storage system; and
- the capacity of its interface with the existing alternating current system.

The excess generating capacity is the sum of the AE system capacity and any excess diesel power generation capacity. This was estimated to be:

  Wind generator     26.4 kWh (running 24 hours)
  Excess diesel      36.6 kWh (running 16 hours)
  Total              64.0 kWh

The figure of 64.0 kWh assumed:
- an average power supply from the wind generator of 1.1 kW over a 24 hour period;
- an average excess of 2.35 kW diesel generating capacity over a 16 hour period. This is the difference between the average peak power demand (12.5 kW) and 90% of rated generator capacity (14.85 kW);
- no available solar power (i.e. winter conditions).

Methods of storing the excess power then had to be found.

Considering that the AC system already in place was three phase, it was convenient to assume a thermal storage capacity equivalent to three 1 kW heaters, one per phase, running each for eight hours, equivalent to 24 kWh of power.

The storage capacity of the AE system is then:
  Electrical     (battery bank)     40 kWh
  Thermal        (storage heaters)  24 kWh
  Total                          64 kWh

An estimate of the required capacity of the AC system interface can be made by dividing the electrical power demand (approximately 40 kWh) by the period of operation (eight hours).

This gives an average delivery of 5 kW, which is a liberal estimate. A more conservative figure would be 31 kW divided over eight hours which would be about 4 kW. This average figure, of course, does not take into account short term demands such as radio or Inmarsat transmissions, or transient surges such as electric motor start ups. Any interface configuration had to take these short term and transient loads into consideration.

Because the sleep time loads were distributed across three phases it was convenient to have three interfaces, i.e. inverters, in the system. This required a minimum continuous power rating of about 1.5 kW per inverter.

5.    Design conclusions

With an aim of providing only for sleep time loads, it was clear that the AE system already in place did not lack generating capacity but rather lacked thermal and electrical storage capacity, adequate power delivery from the electrical storage system to the AC system, and some scheme for scavenging excess generator capacity and channelling it into power storage units.

The upgrading of the AE system basically consisted of:

(1) Replacing the battery bank with one that had the capacity required to meet the sleep time load;

(2) Replacing the existing single inverter with three inverters, one per phase, capable of meeting the sleep time load requirements;

(3) Installing a load management system to maximise the operating efficiency of the diesel generator sets and to divert excess electrical power into the battery bank;

(4) Replacing the existing single 2.4 kW storage heater with three 1 kW storage heaters;

(5) Installing at least one more kerosene heater in the workshop/laboratory area. As it was, the only source of heat for this area was an electric heater which was insufficient for the rapid temperature drops that occurred when the door was opened;

(6) Modifying the wind generator and solar panel array.

6.    New system installation/operation

6(a) Energy storage

A large capacity battery bank was installed, which was able to supply power for all the requirements identified in the design considerations, except for the accommodation heating.

This was made up of 24 GNB ABSOLYTII 2 VOLT CELLS (TYPE 85A39) connected in series. These cells were 1560 Ah (amphours) each, giving a total storage capacity of 1560 Ah at 48 volts, or 74.9 kWh.

This represented a usable capacity of around 37.4 kWh, since the useful storage capacity of a 
38
battery bank is only half that of the quoted 
capacity. Even deep cycle batteries have a 
seriously degraded life expectancy if they are 
continuously discharged below 50% capacity.

The advantages of using these particular 
batteries are that they are completely sealed, 
have fire retardant containers, no outgassing 
occurs, and they recover completely after 
freezing.

A system operating voltage of 48 V DC was 
chosen, to reduce the problems of power loss in 
long cable runs, particularly in the case of the 
wind generator cable.

The installation provided for three separate 
charging sources.

The primary charging source was the wind 
generator, and during the summer months, the 
solar panels. Second, excess diesel generating 
capacity was diverted (with load shedders) into 
the batteries via the inverters' internal battery 
chargers. These could deliver a total of 60 amps 
at 48 V DC. Finally, as a backup, battery 
chargers connected in series could deliver 75 
amps to the batteries powered by the diesel 
generator. These could be switched into the 
system if the primary and secondary systems 
were insufficient to charge fully the battery bank.

6(b) AC System Interface

We replaced the existing inverter with three 
TRACE 48 V DC/234 V AC inverters, type 2248, 
one per phase. These units are fan cooled and 
are rated at 1.5 kW continuous, 2 kW periodic 
(for 30 min.) and 7 kW surge. As mentioned 
above, they also incorporate built in battery 
chargers.

6(c) Load management system

The diesel engine in use was run at its 
maximum, most efficient capacity, with the help 
of three EBERLEE adjustable load shedders, 
Type LA-3G 465 91, one per phase.

These units monitored the per-phase power 
consumption of the base and switched loads on 
and off, via relays, using a three tiered priority 
system. This kept the load as close as possible 
to the most efficient value (as dictated by the 
manufacturer). The desired load was 90% of the 
rated diesel power generator capacity.

6(d) Storage heaters

Three 18 kWn storage heaters were installed, 
one per phase. They were thermally charged 
with the help of the load shedders, using excess 
generating capacity of the diesel power 
generating set. These were not ideal, as they 
drew 2.5 kW, making fine load management 
difficult, but they proved worthwhile and kept the 
base at a comfortable living temperature.

6(e) Kerosene heater

An additional kerosene heater was also installed 
in the workshop/laboratory room (estimated fuel 
consumption 0.31 litres per hour). This unit, 
together with the existing kerosene cooker and 
the storage heaters, kept the base heated during 
the time that the generators were turned off.

6(f) Wind generator and solar panels

The system operating voltage chosen was 48 V 
DC. Although this is not a standard voltage for 
small, independent power installations, the 
suppliers of the wind generator and inverters 
gave assurances that there would be no problem 
in modifying the existing equipment.

Using 48 V, rather than 12 or 24 V, considerably 
reduced the problem of power loss in long cable 
runs, particularly in the case of the wind 
generator cable.

A new winding for the wind generator motor was 
made and installed in order to change its output 
voltage to 48 V. This did not affect its power 
rating.

Two new solar panels of the same type as the 
existing installation were installed, and the array 
configuration modified to give four sets of four 
panels connected in series with a working 
voltage of 48 V.

New regulators for both the wind generator and 
solar array were also installed.

LIST OF EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS

The following is a list of suppliers for World Park Base. It is not a complete list, but contains those names felt to be most useful for the purposes of this report.

Greenpeace in no way endorses these particular suppliers or their products, and further notes that technologies have advanced since the base was built. Nevertheless, Antarctic operators wishing to use some of the ideas outlined in this report might find these addresses useful in tracking down equipment and supplies.
