REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE XVIIIth ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE 
MEETING BY THE DEPOSITARY GOVERNMENT OF THE CONVENTION FOR 
THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC SEALS (UNITED KINGDOM) IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH RECOMMENDATION XIII-2, PARAGRAPH 2(d)

1. This report covers events regarding the Convention for 
the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) from November 1992 
to the present. Events prior to November 1992 were reported 
to the XVIth and XVIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meetings (see Annexes B of the respective Final Reports).

2. On 23 February 1993, the Depositary Government informed 
all Contracting Parties by Diplomatic Note that no Party had 
expressed a need for a formal review meeting under Article 7 
of the Convention. The Depositary Government proposed, 
however, that an informal meeting to exchange information 
and views on the Convention could be held in the margins of 
the meeting of the Twelfth Commission of CCAMLR. Responses 
to the Note confirmed general agreement to this proposal, 
and the Depositary Government informed all Contracting 
Parties on 10 September 1993 by Diplomatic Note that such a 
meeting would be held.

3. The informal meeting was held at The Wrest Point Hotel, 
Hobart, Tasmania on 28 October 1993. Representatives from 
the following Contracting Parties to CCAS attended:

    Argentina                                  Australia
    Belgium                                    Brazil
    Chile                                      France
    Germany                                    Japan
    Norway                                     Poland
    Russia                                     South Africa
    UK                                         USA

    New Zealand (signatory state) attended the meeting as an 
observer.

4.     A non-paper recording the meeting's discussion was 
distributed to all Contracting Parties to the Convention 
under cover of a Diplomatic Note from the Depositary 
Government dated 9 December 1993.  The main points agreed at 
the meeting were the following:

       -       Contracting Parties should comply fully with the 
               reporting requirements of Article 5 of the Convention, 
               and, where appropriate, submit retrospective 
               information;

       -       Contracting Parties should consider endorsement of 
               scientific programmes on seal research, especially the 
               new Antarctic Pack Ice Seals (APIS) Programme;

       -       The Depositary Government would inform Contracting 
               Parties whether the Recommendations adopted at the 1988 
               CCAS Review Meeting had formally entered into force.  
               The Depositary Government confirmed that they had, by 
               Diplomatic Note dated 9 December 1993;

       -       The presence at CCAMLR meetings of CCAS Contracting 
               Parties provided an opportunity for future informal 
               meetings to review the Convention periodically, and to 
               exchange views.

5.     Since the XVIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
there have been no accessions to the Convention for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Seals.  A list of countries which 
were original signatories of the Convention, and of countries 
which have subsequently acceded, is attached (Annex A to this 
Report).

6. States which are signatories to CCAS or which have 
acceded to the Convention, or which have been invited to 
accede, have been kept informed of developments involving the 
Convention by receiving copies of the relevant diplomatic 
correspondence.
