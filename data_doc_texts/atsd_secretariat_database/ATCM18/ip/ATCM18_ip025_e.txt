MARINE HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL SERVICES TO NAVIGATION IN THE
SOUTHERN OCEAN

1      Introduction

WMO has noted that XVI ATCM did not support proposals for the
development of formal international meteorological services in
the Antarctic which had originally been proposed at XIV ATCM
and which had been the subject of a series of further
discussions since that meeting.  Thus, questions concerning
the improvement of meteorological and ice information services
for marine and aviation operations in Antarctica will, for the
present, continue to be addressed at a national level and be
discussed between WMO and COMNAP and, where appropriate, IOC.

2      Currently, meteorological services are being provided by
five designated stations in the Antarctic viz

Casey
McMurdo
Marambio
Molodezhnaya and
Presidente Frei

The detailed programs of these stations in service provision
to aviation and shipping were provided to the Sixth Session of
the WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic
Meteorology (EX-WGAM) in November 1993 and are detailed in its
report.  EC-WGAM noted the requirement for services
particularly in relation to the growing tourism industry and
agreed that every effort should be made to seek observations
from tour operators who are, or will be, major users of
meteorological services and specifically urged that tourist
ships operating in the Antarctic waters be recruited to the
Voluntary Observing Ships scheme.  The importance of
meteorological services in the area of environmental
protection and in the event of major environmental emergencies
is also apparent.

3      The Sixth Session of EC-WGAM reviewed the requirements
for meteorological services for shipping, air navigation,
local operations and research in Antarctica and recommended
practices on data processing activities and meteorological
services as shown at Attachment 1. It further noted that
processed meteorological information required from centres
outside the Antarctic are selected products of the World
Meteorological Centre (WMC) Melbourne, WMC Washington; the
Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) at
Blacknell (UK) and the RSMC, European Centre for Medium Range
Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Meteorological Centre,
Pretoria.

4      Thus, meteorological services are being provided in 
Antarctica but as pointed out previously to ATCM and COMNAP,
the quality of these will be highly dependent on the extent to
which all Treaty nations are prepared to contribute to the
improvement of basic networks, communications and research.

5      A specific research project (FROST-First Regional 
Observing Study of the Troposphere) aimed, inter alia, at 
examining the accuracy of numerical meteorological analyses 
and forecasts in the Antarctic has been planned by SCAR and 
its operational phase will begin later in 1994 (a brief 
description is given at Attachment 2).  WMO supports this 
experiment and urges Treaty nations to support it in 
appropriate ways.
ATTACHMENT

Data-processing activities and meteorological services in the 
Antarctic

1.      It is proposed that data-processing and meteorological 
service functions be carried out by the following stations in 
the Antarctic:

        Casey
        McMurdo
        Marambio
        Molodeznaja
        Presidente Frei

2.      The functions proposed for stations in the Antarctic 
providing data-processing and other meteorological services 
including services for shipping, aircraft, local operations 
and research are:

    (a) Preparation of meteorological analyses and prognoses 
for the whole of the Antarctic or for defined sectors 
thereof, and making them promptly available to other 
stations inside or outside the Antarctic;

    (b) Preparation of specialized meteorological forecasts 
for users (marine and aviation interests, traverse 
parties, etc.), and making them promptly available to 
other stations inside or outside the Antarctic. 
Products that may be required should include for the 
relevant areas and subject to seasonal variation:

    -   surface analyses with frontal positions and 
present weather at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC;

    -   surface prognostic charts showing frontal 
positions and weather forecast for up to 2 
days and longer where possible;

    -   local area forecasts in support of remote 
aircraft operations on request;

    -   upper-air analysis for 00, 12 UTC for the 
standard levels (H, W, T);

    -   upper-air forecasts for the standard levels 
for up to 2 days and longer where possible (H, 
W, T);

    -   swell and wave (sea state) analysis for 00, 12 
UTC and forecasts for up to 2 days;

    -   sea ice analysis at about 20 km resolution or 
better with prognoses for up to 2 days;
- 2 -

  o       local sea ice analyses on request;
  o       satellite orbital data in the appropriate code 
          form on request;

(c)     Preparation and distribution of warnings of dangerous 
        weather conditions for the area for which the station 
        prepares analyses, prognoses or specialized forecasts; 
        products that may be required should include:

  o     forecasts of icing conditions and other 
        dangerous weather for surface, ship and air 
        operations;

(d)     support for research activities as required.

NOTE:   It is recognized that the carrying out of these 
        functions is subject to seasonal variations between 
        the austral summer and winter.

3.      Criteria for inclusion of an Antarctic station in the 
list of stations proposed in paragraph 1 are:

(a)     That the station is willing to carry out the functions 
        indicated in paragraph 2 above to the maximum extent 
        possible;

(b)     That the station has, or will have in the near future, 
        the capability of carrying out the functions 
        adequately;

(c)     That at least one other station inside or outside the 
        Antarctic requires the processed information available 
        from the station;

(d)     That the station should have adequate 
        telecommunication facilities to receive observational 
        data and exchange and distribute processed information 
        with other stations as required.
