AGENDA ITEM 6

NEW ZEALAND ANTARCTIC PROGRAMME ENVIRONMENTAL
AUDIT

Considering that:

· there have now been three Antarctic operating seasons to take into
account the requirements of the Madrid Protocol;

· national legislation to implement the Protocol in New Zealand is in
draft form;

New Zealand has contracted an independent environmental audit of
Antarctic Programme (NZAP) activities in the 1993/94 season. The objective
of the audit was to review progress towards compliance with the Protocol
and identify areas in need of improvement:

· review obligations, legislation and NZAP policies;
· review operational procedures;
· assess facilities operations and technical aspects;
· comment on the environmental impact and risk of the above
procedures and operations;
· produce recommendations on procedures, facilities, monitoring and
research requirements.

The table of contents and the executive summary of the audit are provided
for the information of Treaty Parties. The format of the report provides
assessment of compliance against the Articles and Annexes of the Protocol,
and review and assessment of procedures and operating practices and how
they could be improved. This provides useful operational guidelines as well
as a compliance monitoring.

A second objective was to review NZ activities in the Antarctic in respect of
New Zealand environmental management procedures. This has been
covered in a second report which is not presented to this meeting.

Copies of the full document are available from the New Zealand Antarctic
Programme (postal address 14 091, Christchurch, New Zealand), for a price
of $NZ40 to cover printing and postage costs.

Executive Summary

Compliance Overview

The findings of this environmental audit indicate that the New Zealand Antarctic Programme (NZAP), as the organisation supporting scientific and other programmes in Antarctica, has achieved a high level of compliance with the Madrid Protocol to date. The organisation is committed to the Protocol and has progressively taken a number of pro-active measures in order to achieve this degree of environmental protection, the key measures including:

(i)     the recent establishment of an Environmental Officer's position to assist with the implementation of the Protocol;

(ii)    the undertaking of this audit;

(iii)   the training of NZAP and Event personnel to ensure environmental awareness and to limit the environmental impacts of their activities;

(iv)   environmental impact assessment of all NZAP and other activities prior to their being approved;

(v)    the implementation of measures for conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna, including the identification of specially protected species;

(vi)   the implementation of a permitting system for the collection of specimens, visiting areas of special value and taking seeds to Antarctica;

(vii)  the restriction of activities within areas of special value (ASPAs and SSSIs) and protecting historic sites and monuments;

(viii) the appointment of a Waste Management Officer and the preparation and annual review of a Waste Management Policy which outlines waste management procedures and waste disposal operations;

(ix)   the attention to many detailed waste management issues, both at Scott Base and in the field; and

(x)    other planned measures (eg. matters relating to protected areas) await ratification of the Protocol.

The audit has systematically examined NZAP procedures (both procedural and operational) and matched these against the detailed requirements of the Protocol. Where the main Protocol text and Annexes are specific in their requirements, it is a relatively straightforward exercise to assess compliance. However, Article 3 (2a) of the main Protocol text states that:

"activities in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment and associated and dependant ecosystems".

March 1994                        Page ix
Whilst the requirements of Article 3 (2a) are less specific, this represents a key Article against 
which environmental protection should be maximised. The audit identified certain areas 
where Protocol requirements are not being met at present. The key recommendations relating 
to areas in which compliance is either lacking or could be improved include:

(i)    the monitoring of impacts;
(ii)   the stronger promotion of the "environmental ethic" and the incorporation of the 
       thrust of the Protocol/Act into a new NZAP "mission statement";
(iii)  the use of more user-friendly promotion and training techniques, such as an 
       "environmental code of practice", to improve and encourage "ownership" of Antarctic 
       environmental protection;
(iv)   the provision of more advice on the practicalities of Antarctic camping;
(v)    fuel and chemical management procedures;
(vi)   some changes to waste management procedures;
(vii)  the assessment and management of cumulative effects of activities by the NZ and 
       other national programmes;
(viii) more job specific training for some key Scott Base positions; and
(ix)   the provision of better record keeping and inventories to assist in future management 
       and planning of NZAP's own logistical support and scientific activities.

NZAP compliance with Article 3 has been judged against what the auditors believe is the 
practically achievable level of environmental protection in the Antarctic (given the climatic, 
logistical and other constraints). It is necessary to bear in mind that a balance will usually 
be required between environmental protection and operational limitations or difficulties.

NZAP displays a high level of compliance with the more specific requirements of the relevant 
(to NZAP) Protocol and Annex articles. Recommendations are given to achieve full 
compliance against these clear requirements, where compliance is lacking. These 
recommendations are presented in Section 6. It should be noted, however, that there are 
several Protocol areas (eg the management of ASMAs, ASPAs, historic sites and monuments) 
where the responsibility for the issues raised is not always clear and in the main fall outside 
the responsibility of NZAP. Other NZ bodies responsible for Protocol implementation 
include the Ross Dependency Research Committee (RDRC), the Antarctic Policy Unit (APU) 
and the Antarctic Heritage Trust.

Where non-compliance has been recorded, NZAP is generally aware of its own shortcomings 
and is, in some instances, already addressing the issue for the next summer season. It is 
noted that several current scenarios exist within NZAP for the required compliance 
mechanisms:

(i)    the mechanism is almost in place but is somewhat ad hoc and needs formalising;
(ii)   the mechanism will be established in the near future (currently being actioned);
(iii)  the mechanism is awaiting Protocol ratification;
(iv)   the mechanism does not exist; or
(v)    the mechanism is either the sole or part responsibility of some other NZ organisation 
       (eg. APU, RDRC, Antarctic Heritage Trust).

The auditors also identified further recommendations within the category of "improving compliance" under Article 3 (2a). These recommendations relate to either specific changes in procedure or to areas requiring closer examination. NZAP is strongly advised to address these issues in order to achieve the highest possible degree of environmental protection. These recommendations are, in themselves, often relatively small matters (relating, for example, to waste management and fuel handling), although cumulatively they will result in significant improvements to the NZAP operations.

Sections 5 and 6 of the report summary below further elaborate on both the areas of compliance and key areas where recommendations have been made.

Report Summary (follows report section numbering)

1.0  Setting the Scene

1.1  This document presents the findings of an audit of the New Zealand Antarctic Programme(NZAP) undertaken by Royds Consulting Limited (formerly Royds Garden Limited) between November 1993-March 1994. The audit evaluated NZAP activities with respect to the formal requirements of the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty 1991 (the Protocol), and as far as practicable, the New Zealand Antarctic (Environmental Protection) Bill No 259-1 presently before Parliament. The Protocol, the Bill and the Antarctic Treaty establish environmental standards for NZAP. It should be noted here that NZAP, as referred to in this report, represent the support and management of the New Zealand science programme and not the science itself.

1.2  The audit brief was to review NZAP performance in relation to the Protocol and the Bill; to assess where improvements could be made; and to position NZAP for the next 5 years. The audit scope was to review obligations, legislation and NZAP policies; review operational procedures; assess facilities, operations and technical aspects; comment on environmental risk of procedures and operations; and make recommendations on procedures, facilities, monitoring and research needs.

1.3  This report presents NZAP structure, activities and history; Protocol and Bill requirements; audit methodology; audit findings; an assessment of compliance; and recommendations to ensure compliance.

1.4  The audit team comprised Jim Bradley (environmental engineer, waste management specialist and audit team leader); Linda Smith (environmental scientist and auditing specialist); Christine Byrch (environmental scientist); Dr Mike Patrick (senior environmental scientist and audit specialist, internal review); Professor George Knox (scientist with extensive Antarctic experience, former member of international Antarctic committees, internal review).

2.0  New Zealand Antarctic Programme and other Antarctic Agencies

2.1  The Ross Dependency is under the jurisdiction of the Governor General of New Zealand. New Zealand scientists have been involved in Antarctic research and maintained a presence at Scott Base since 1957.

March 1994                                   Page vi
2.2     At a central government level, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) have a 
        major role in implementing the Protocol and Bill. The Antarctic Policy Unit (APU) of the 
        Environmental Division of MFAT assists with the continuity of New Zealand’s Antarctic 
        science, and coordinating New Zealand’s Antarctic policy.

        An agency, formerly DSIR Antarctic Division and now known as NZAP, was established in 
        1958 to provide operational support to New Zealand scientists in Antarctica. NZAP is a 
        division of MFAT.

        The Ross Dependency Research Committee, formed by Government in 1958, provides 
        continuity to New Zealand science and advises Government on the organisation and 
        administration of New Zealand Antarctic activities. The environmental assessment group 
        (appointed by RDRC) assesses the environmental implications of all Antarctic activities. The 
        Royal Society Standing Committee on Antarctic Research is the national body that interacts 
        with SCAR.

2.3     Relevant international agencies include the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research 
        (SCAR) established by the International Council of Scientific Unions (1958) to initiate, 
        promote and coordinate scientific activity in Antarctica (New Zealand has a National SCAR); 
        and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP).

2.4     NZAP is the official New Zealand government scientific support programme. NZAP 
        maintains New Zealand’s scientific, research and other interests and a presence in Antarctica, 
        and comprises headquarters in Christchurch and management and logistic support in 
        Antarctica. NZAP Antarctic activities are based at Scott Base, and have significantly 
        impacted this immediate environment. For the purposes of this audit, NZAP activities were 
        grouped as "procedures" and "operations".

        NZAP is a complex organisation involving a great many logistical interactions between 
        themselves (both the permanent Christchurch-based staff and seasonal Scott Base staff), 
        science personnel and national and international bodies. As a consequence, this audit has 
        been a complex exercise, especially in areas where certain Protocol requirements are the joint 
        responsibility of a number of bodies (which may or may not include NZAP).

3.0     The Protocol Requirements and Adoption by New Zealand

3.1     There is international agreement that the Antarctic environment should be protected against 
        the impact of human activities. This agreement is formalised by the Antarctic Treaty and 
        more recently the Protocol.

3.2     The Antarctic Treaty, first signed in 1959 and subsequently amended by additional 
        conventions and recommendations, facilitates research in Antarctica and ensures the 
        opportunity for all nations to conduct scientific and other peaceful activities in Antarctica. 
        In New Zealand, the Antarctica Act 1960 ratifies the main body of the Treaty, with additional 
        legislation and regulations to ratify the amendments.

3.3     The Protocol, signed in Madrid in 1991, reiterates and strengthens the Antarctic Treaty 
        system, enhancing the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated 
        ecosystems whilst recognising the unique scientific and research opportunities offered. With 
        respect to this audit, Article 3 (2a) Environmental Principals is the key which states that all 
        activities within the Treaty area "shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse 
        impacts on the environment and dependent and associated ecosystems".

NZAP Environmental Audit 
March 1994                                                             Royds Consulting 
                                                                                          Page vii
3.4 Once enacted, The New Zealand Antarctic (Environmental Protection) Bill no 259-1 will ratify the Protocol within New Zealand legislation. The current draft of the Bill includes offence provisions and other specific requirements outside those of the Protocol.

4.0 The Audit Methodology

4.1 This environmental audit follows a methodical investigation of compliance of NZAP activities with the Protocol and the Bill.

4.2 Requirements of the Protocol (the primary compliance document) and Bill requirements are identified.

4.3 NZAP operations and activities are identified from document review; interviews with Christchurch staff; an examination of Christchurch facilities; interviews with Scott Base staff; and examination of Scott Base and field related activities. In addition, discussions and interviews were held with Event personnel and others outside NZAP. Operations and activities are identified under the groupings "procedures" and "operations".

4.4 Throughout the review, existing and potential environmental impacts are qualitatively assessed.

4.5 For all NZAP activities relevant requirements are identified, and compliance with these requirements is assessed. Audit findings are presented in both table and text form.

4.6 Recommendations are made to ensure compliance where there is non compliance and to improve compliance where possible. The majority of the recommendations are to improve compliance. These recommendations for improving compliance are largely associated with the less specific articles, eg article 3 of the main Protocol.

5.0 NZAP Compliance with the Protocol

5.1 This section describes and evaluates NZAP procedures, compliance with the Protocol and provides recommendations to ensure or improve compliance for the "procedures" category, these being; management structure; policy; training; exchange of information; record/report keeping; purchasing; environmental impact assessment; conservation of antarctic fauna and flora; permitting; management of areas of special value; field procedures; base procedures; and monitoring.

      Compliance with general Protocol and specific Annex requirements is high. Key areas of non-compliance relate to the lack of detail for preliminary environmental impact assessments, the inadequate level of monitoring, some poor camp management activities and the inadequate training of some Scott Base personnel.

5.2 This section describes and evaluates NZAP procedures, compliance with the Protocol and provides recommendations to ensure or improve compliance for the "operations" category, these being; solid waste management; sewage and liquid wastes; materials handling, storage and transport; fuel storage, use and transport; vehicle maintenance and use; water systems; commissioning/decommissioning; contingencies; building design; energy efficiency; general base maintenance.

March 1994                                Page viii
The level of compliance with Annex III (Waste Disposal and Waste Management) is high. 
Key areas of non-compliance relate to the uncertain impacts of sewage discharges and some 
practices in the areas of fuel handling/storage and materials handling/storage.

5.3     Common matters identified throughout the audit were that:

(i)     although NZAP are committed to implementing the Protocol, implementation to date 
        is not yet complete;

(ii)    that interpretation of the Protocol requires an appreciation of the balance between 
        environmental protection and what is practicable to achieve;

(iii)   cross media effects (eg incinerating solid or semi-solid waste produces ash and 
        atmospheric emissions) must be appreciated;

(iv)    all NZAP activities and procedures are interlinked and should not be viewed in 
        isolation;

(v)     there is some reluctance to commit procedures to paper;

(vi)    computerised systems would improve recording procedures;

(vii)   standards and performance monitoring are required;

(viii)  the concept of ambassadorship should be promoted; and

(ix)    the importance of international co-operation and cumulative international 
        environmental effects from various international activities should not be overlooked.

5.4     There are research opportunities and needs in key areas of uncertainty relating to the 
environmental impacts (and particularly cumulative impacts) of activities undertaken in 
Antarctica. Environmental research is required to ensure future Events are conducted in the 
most appropriate manner with respect to the environment.

5.5     Whilst outside the audit scope, it is noted that a common and consistent approach to the 
adoption of the Protocol and forthcoming Act is required throughout all New Zealand 
Antarctic agencies. A strategy for overall management of funding and fund allocation for 
the Antarctic environment should also be considered to better meet the overall objective of 
environmental protection.

6.0     Summary of Compliance and Recommendations

6.1     Overall, NZAP activities achieve a high level of compliance with and awareness of the 
Protocol.  The following tables summarise compliance with the Protocol and 
recommendations to ensure compliance. These tables highlight areas of non-compliance or 
partial compliance and are discussed in more detail in Section 6.

        The recommendations in Section 5 include the non-compliance issues. However, most of the 
recommendations in this section relate to areas of "improving compliance" with the less 
specific requirements of article 3 (2a) "Environmental Principles", under which all activities 
in the Antarctic Treaty area "shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse impacts 
on the environment and dependent and associated ecosystems", rather than the often very 
specific requirements of, for example, Annex V "Area Protection and Management".
