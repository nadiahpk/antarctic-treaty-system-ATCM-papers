OPENING ADDRESS BY MS WANJA TORNBERG
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF SWEDEN

May I on behalf of the Swedish delegation express thanks to the
Japanese Government for hosting our XVIIIth Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting in this beautiful old city and may I also
congratulate you, Mr Chairman, on your election.

Mr Chairman, what happens in Antarctica could affect the
environment in the rest of the world and there is thus naturally a
global interest in the southern continent. The long tradition of
close co-operation among the Treaty Parties in Treaty meetings and
in Antarctica itself has produced an important range of measures to
protect the Antarctic environment. We are fortunate to have a sound
basis for effective action. It is therefore important that we also,
at this the XVIIIth meeting, move ahead to further improve
conditions in Antarctica.

The vitality of the system is, however, not necessarily promoted by
the production of new texts and regulations. The Swedish delegation
considers that there is now a need to critically assess new
proposals with regard to their contributions in the overall
context. Over the years the number of Recommendations, some of them
now obsolete, have accumulated and they should be reviewed.

We want to make a strong appeal to all Parties to the Treaty to
ratify the Protocol without any undue delay. Before the
ratification is completed the interim implementation of the
Protocol is, in the view of the Swedish delegation, of highest
priority. We must make sure that the procedures of the Protocol
work efficiently and ensure that solutions are found to enable the
Committee for Environmental Protection to be established as soon as
2

the Protocol enters into force.

We also consider it very important that the work on the elaboration 
of an Annex on Liability as set out in Article 16 of the Protocol 
continues and is completed as soon as possible.

Mr Chairman, I am pleased to inform you that Sweden ratified the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection last month and that a Swedish 
Antarctica Act, based on the provisions in the Protocol, entered 
into force on the 1st of this month. Sweden has also approved all 
the Recommendations from the XVth, XVIth and XVII Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meetings.

A Swedish observer team inspected nine stations in Antarctica 
during the month of January this year. The observers were welcomed 
at all the stations and the Antarctic spirit of co-operation was 
much in evidence. The report of the observers will be available 
at this meeting.
