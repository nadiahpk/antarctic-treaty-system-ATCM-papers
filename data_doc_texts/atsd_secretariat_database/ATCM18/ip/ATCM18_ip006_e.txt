SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMES OCTOBER 1993 TO SEPTEMBER 1994

MARINE BIOLOGY                                  PELAGIC ECOSYSTEM STUDIES

Biogeochemistry

A biochemical study will be undertaken of size-fractionated microbial rate processes in 
contrasting marine environments.

Biology and ecology of Antarctic krill

A joint study on the biology and ecology of Antarctic krill will be undertaken by RRS 
James Clark Ross and RV Africana around South Georgia. The behaviour of krill in 
relation to predators and small-scale hydrographic features will be studied.

Ecology of Southern Ocean zooplankton

The ecology of Southern Ocean zooplankton will be studied through a continuation of 
research on the feeding and egg production rates of Copepoda. Additionally animals 
maintained on board RRS James Clark Ross will be fed radio-labelled food for assessment 
of egg-production rates.

Gear development

An implementation is planned of the Down Wire Net Monitoring system with the 
Horizontal Antarctic Multiple Plankton Sampler. Both items are undergoing improvements 
based on experiences last season.

Biology of Antarctic fish

The role played by mesopelagic fish in the Antarctic oceanic food web will be studied, 
particularly the myctophids, who form a major fin-fishery in Antarctic waters. It is 
planned to determine the species composition, biomass spectrum, demography and 
accessibility of the dominant fish to the major predators.

A sampling programme by SCUBA divers will estimate the biomass and population 
structure of Harpagifer antarcticus.

A laboratory respirometry study will evaluate the metabolic rate of Harpagifer in relation 
to nutritional status.

The Southern Ocean: Modelling and ecosystem analysis

In the UK, the temporal and spatial structure of the Southern Ocean ecosystem will be 
analysed through models which take account of the scales of variability and their 
interaction. Models will also be developed of the dynamics of the microbial community 
within the euphotic zone.

- 23 -
Krill distribution and abundance

The krill flux in the major fishing and predator foraging area are being estimated and related to the estimated predator consumption rates and the reported commercial catches.

The prospect of using multiple frequency echo-sounders to estimate krill size distribution and identify species is being studied to reduce the requirement for a large numbers of net hauls to verify acoustic targets.

Biology and ecology of Southern Ocean cephalopods

Studies will continue on cephalopod predators such as albatross species, the southern elephant seal and king penguin.

Studies will continue on cephalopod life cycles, especially those factors which lie at the interface between the biology of the organism and the population.

Studies will characterise the pelagic community along latitudinal and vertical gradients and analyse the trophic niche width of pelagic cephalopods.

Satellite tagged albatrosses will be used to identify specific areas of squid concentrations in the northern Scotia Sea. The dynamics of the pelagic food chain in these areas will be determined.

UK Support for CCAMLR activities

Advice will continue to be provided to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on scientific questions related to CCAMLR (Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources).

The physical structure of the northern Scotia Sea will be examined in relation to the abundance, distribution and interrelationships of the various biological components of the pelagic ecosystem.

Diving survey of the environs of Rothera Research Station

A diving survey will provide background knowledge on the biology of the marine environment close to Rothera Point. Divers will use photography to record the habitat types and associated fauna; fishing will determine what species are easily sampled within the safe boating environs of Rothera.

HIGHER PREDATOR STUDIES

Energy flux: food, feeding and bioenergetics of Antarctic seabirds and seals

The dynamics of the consumption of marine prey by seabirds and seal predators will be investigated at various spatial and temporal scales.

The foraging ecology of fur seals, albatrosses and penguin predators will be studied in relation to the abundance, distribution and movements of zooplankton (krill) prey. Instrumented predators will be used to locate prey patches. Similar studies will be carried out with squid and myctophid fish and avian predators.

- 24 -
Demography: population dynamics of Antarctic seabirds and seals

The factors influencing the population processes and life history traits of seabirds and 
seals will be studied.

Studies will continue on the factors which have led to a decline in the population of all 
three albatross species and to an increase in the population of Antarctic fur seals.

Monitoring reproductive performance of Antarctic seabirds and seals

Seabird and seal breeding populations will be monitored for factors which might provide 
indices sensitive to environmental change, such as responses to the abundance or 
availability of prey. Results from the monitoring will be reported to the Commission for 
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) through its Ecosystem 
Monitoring Programme (CEMP).

Elephant seal population studies

Studies will continue on how age and condition influence the reproductive success in 
female and male elephant seals and how this relates to the annual energy budget of 
individuals.

The diet and foraging ecology of elephant seals will be studied to assess their role as 
predators in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The study will be carried out at Husvik, 
South Georgia and involves the use of satellite transmitters.

ECOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS

Seasonality in the nearshore Antarctic marine ecosystem

In the UK, local seasonal patterns revealed at Signy Island will be related to larger scale 
patterns revealed by remote sensing.

The long-term monitoring project at Signy Island will continue that documents seasonal 
and year to year variations in ice-cover, seawater temperature, chlorophyll and nutrient 
concentration.

Physiology of Southern Ocean marine invertebrates and fish

Studies will continue on the factors which promote the low metabolic rates of polar 
marine invertebrates and fish. Particular emphasis is on how these factors are influenced 
by feeding and reproduction.

A twelve-month project will start on the feeding and nitrogen metabolism in the limpet 
Narcella concinna.

The effects of iceberg scour on soft sediment communities in Factory Cove, Signy Island 
will be studied and recovery rates after scouring assessed.

Live fish will be delivered to the UK for continuing studies of the growth and activity 
metabolism of demersal fish.

- 25 -
Ecology of Southern Ocean benthic marine organisms

Studies will continue on the patterns of growth, nutrient storage and reproduction of marine invertebrates, for these are areas where adaptations to low temperature and a seasonal food supply are intimately related.

Studies of the development of marine invertebrate larvae will be carried out in the laboratories at Signy Research Station.

The long-term study of the growth of brachiopods, bivalve molluscs and octoral will be continued into a third year.

TERRESTRIAL AND FRESHWATER BIOLOGY

    SURVIVAL STRATEGIES

Colonisation of terrestrial environments

Long-term studies of propagule banks and colonisation processes will continue on Alexander Island using plastic cloches.

Year-round monitoring of protozoan and microbial colonisation of sites under cloches will continue on Signy Island.

An aerobiological survey will be carried out from RRS Bransfield from the UK and during normal Antarctic operations.

Reproduction and population studies

The reproductive strategies and life history traits of Antarctic invertebrates and cryptograms will be studied to determine the characteristics of their reproductive success.

At Husvik, South Georgia, studies will continue on the colonisation of near-shore habitats by arthropods. The ecophysiology of carabid beetles and the feeding and energetics of herbivorous insects will be studied. The impact on indigenous species of an introduced predatory beetle will also be studied.

Physiological and biochemical strategies

Studies will continue on the role of water, ice nucleation and freezing in the survival strategies of Antarctic microbes, invertebrates and plants.

The resilience of a range of organisms to stresses imposed by the Antarctic environment will be studied through physiological-biochemical screening.

The microbial utilisation of carbon will be studied in cold aquatic systems.

The photosynthesis and respiration of bryophytes will be studied in response to different levels of light, temperature and hydration state.

The physiological and growth performance of bryophytes will be related to their ecological niche preference and survival capacity.

- 26 -
ECOSYSTEMS AND CONSERVATION

Microenvironments

Microclimates of Antarctic habitats will be studied using automatic systems.

Nutrient cycling

The relative contributions of chemical, physical and biological weathering to nutrient release will continue to be studied in selected Antarctic ecosystems.

At Signy Island the long term lake sampling programme will continue.

Ecosystem and community development

In the UK, models of Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems will be developed to predict the results of climate change so that the needs of environmental management and conservation can be well-based.

Conservation and Environmental Management

In the UK, conservation advice will be provided for Antarctic protected areas and sites of development.

Wastes will be managed according to the prescriptions of the Protocol on the Protection of the Antarctic Environment.

Antarctic protected areas near to Signy Island will be inspected and marked.

Impact assessment monitoring will continue at Signy, Faraday and Rothera.

Terrestrial and Freshwater Resource Centre

In the UK, the Terrestrial and Freshwater Resource Centre will continue as a tool for ecosystem studies, a focus for taxonomic and biogeographical research and a resource for environmental and conservation matters.

GEOLOGY

WEST ANTARCTIC CRUSTAL DEVELOPMENT AND PLATE-TECTONIC EVOLUTION

    VHF Homing beacon 121.5 MHz.
    All beacons available on request.

3. DAMOY POINT

    (a) Position: DAMOY POINT, Wiencke Island, Palmer Archipelago, lat. 64°49'S, long. 
        63°32'W. (Magnetic variation 16°E).

    (b) Height of runway above mean sea level: about 46 metres. Uphill gradient 
        SW to NE. Landing strip convex across its width.

    (c) Nearest station: Small hut close to Dorian Bay with accommodation for 10-15 
        persons. Used intermittently by British Antarctic Survey personnel during 
        Antarctic summer season. Hut contains food and medical supplies.
        Expected to be occupied from early November until early December for 
        personnel routing to Rothera from Damoy, with party reporting by radio to 
        Rothera Station.

    (d) Runway facilities: Bearing of runway 050°/230° magnetic (approx. 3500 feet 
        only).
        This runway shows signs of considerable deterioration during mid to late 
        summer, with crevassing becoming apparent parallel to the runway. Anyone 
        intending to use it should contact Rothera for information about its 
        serviceability. Skiway unusable late December to March.

    (e) Surface of runway: Unprepared snow.

    (f) Period of operation: Summer Operation (October-December for BAS air 
        operations only).

    (g) Ground facilities: No ground facilities.

4.  FOSSIL BLUFF

(a) Position: FOSSIL BLUFF, George VI Sound, lat. 71°20'S, long. 68°17'W.
(Magnetic Variation 23.5°East in 1980)

(b) Height on runway above mean sea level: about 92 metres. Slope up to south.

(c) Nearest station: Fossil Bluff lies about 1.6 km NNW of landing area. Food 
and medical supplies at huts. Station normally manned October-March, with 
party reporting to Rothera Station.

(d) Runway facilities:
The skiway is 1200 m long and marked by drums on the west of the skiway. 
The bearing is 203°/23T. This landing area is an ice shelf in front of the hut 
and immediately on its western side is bounded by the steep-sided Bluff. 
Landing on 020° necessitates keeping close to the high ground before a 
low-level final turn onto 020°. During summer with high melt conditions the 
strip may become unusable, being either a small lake or a hard frozen area of 
sharp-edged corrugations.

(e) Surface of runway: Unprepared snow.

(f) Period of operation: Summer operation. Can deteriorate due to heavy melt 
in mid-summer season.

(g) Ground facilities: HF link on 5080 LSB to Rothera (minimum twice daily).

NOTICE OF SHIPS CARRYING OUT SUBSTANTIAL OCEANOGRAPHIC
RESEARCH PROGRAMMES IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

CRUISE JR06: MARINE BIOLOGICAL CRUISE TO STUDY PREDATOR/PREY
INTERACTIONS IN THE SCOTIA SEA AND AROUND SOUTH GEORGIA

December 31 1993 to March 5 1994

RRS James Clark Ross will undertake a multi-disciplinary research cruise in the northern Scotia Sea and around
South Georgia. The cruise will have participants from British Antarctic Survey, UK universities and overseas
institutes. In addition, part of the cruise will be carried out as a two ship operation in collaboration with South
African scientists aboard RS Africana.

The programme comprises two legs divided by a logistics call to the South Orkney Islands and the Falkland
Islands. RRS James Clark Ross starts the first leg of the cruise in the Falkland Islands 30/31 December 1993,
departs from South Georgia on 20 January 1994 for the South Orkney Islands and returns to the Falkland Islands
for 27 January 1994. The second component of the cruise at South Georgia departs from the Falkland Islands
on 29 January and is completed by 5 March 1994. RRS James Clark Ross is joined at South Georgia by RS
Africana for the period 14-27 February 1994.

The objective of the cruise will be a study of predator-prey interactions at various scales. The core programme
is to link the behaviour of dominant krill-feeding and squid/fish-feeding predators with a detailed study of the
oceanography and biomass spectra in regions where they are aggregating to feed. The use of satellite telemetry
to locate the predators and satellite imagery to observe the major features of the ocean enable, for the first time,
a study at this level of sophistication in the Southern Ocean.

CRUISE JR07: MARINE GEOPHYSICAL STUDIES IN THE WEDDELL SEA

March 8 to April 4 1994

The objective of the cruise is to obtain a better understanding of the tectonic evolution of the area affected by
the separation of South America and Antarctica. The techniques to be employed include, four channel seismic
reflection profiling, gravity and magnetics, echo sounding and dredging.

The ship will head from the Falkland Islands across the Falkland Trough. Depth, gravity and magnetic fields
will be logged across the northern Scotia Sea to a point at 55°S, 40°W, where the ship will turn south along
40°W to Jane Bank and thence into the Weddell Sea to a work area (A on map). The southward course will
follow "flow lines" determined from recent satellite mapping of the gravity field, until about 69°S, where a major
boundary occurs. The seismic streamer and airguns will be deployed and a series of profiles shot both across
the discontinuity and along the suspected strike of the crust to the south. The objectives are to determine the
age difference across the discontinuity, to define the character of the crust to the south and to account for the
absence of fracture zone signals. Magnetic mapping north of the discontinuity will provide evidence for the age
of Weddell Sea crust between the series of NNE-SSW fracture zones identified from satellite gravity.
Area B (on the map) is an area affected by complex changes in plate motions, where a series of closely spaced
profiles will be run within a box to determine basement structure and age. The seismic profiling system will
be deployed and logged, along with depth, magnetics and gravity. Geophysical data will also be acquired over
part of the South Scotia Ridge to the west of Jane Bank to date the oceanic crust immediately adjacent to the
inactive arc (area C on map). Current meter moorings (IX an XI on the map) will be recovered.

CRUISE 207: WORLD OCEAN CIRCULATION EXPERIMENT

February 14 to March 27 1994

RRS Discovery will undertake a cruise (see map for location) as part of a wider international investigation 
into the rates and pathway of the global abyssal circulation, as a component of the World Ocean 
Circulation Experiment (WOCE). This will coordinate with other research programmes being under-
taken in the Southern Ocean as part of the UK WOCE effort.

      products. The logistics purchasing section of BAS makes every effort 
      to prevent such products from being sent to Antarctica.

PART 3 WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR EACH FIXED SITE, FIELD CAMPS GENERALLY, AND FOR EACH SHIP.

1) Programs for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites:
    CLEAN-UP of ABANDONED BASES - 1992/93
    Halley IV - The clean-up st Halley IV continued. Working conditions were difficult 
    as the ambient temperature inside the station was -18°C and the building was 
    being slowly crushed by overlying ice and snow. However all remaining hazardous 
    wastes, fuel, general contents and most fixtures and fittings were removed. Those 
    items left could not be safely removed. The clean-up team consisted of four people.

2) Current and planned waste management arrangements, including final disposal:
    BIODEGRADABLE WASTE
    Sewage, wet food waste, food bones and grey water are disposed of on site and are 
    not returned from the Antarctic.
    GENERAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE
    General non-hazardous waste (metal, glass, plastics etc) is taken by BAS ships to 
    the Falkland Islands (FI) where it is disposed of safely at Mount Pleasant Airfield
    Combustible wastes are burnt in a high temperature incinerator. Waste oils and 
    are burnt in a waste oil burner. Non-combustible wastes are sent for controlled 
    hazardous wastes
    All hazardous wastes are returned to the UK where they are safely disposed of by high temperatui

3) Current and planned arrangements for analyzing the environmental effects of 
    wastes and waste management:
    ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAMME - SIGNY
    Examination of heavy metals in sea water, marine sediments and lichens and hydrocarbons 
    in soil samples. Marine debris survey on beaches.
    ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAMME - ROTHERA
    Examination of heavy metals in lichens and hydrocarbons in soil samples. Planned 
    underwater video and photography around sewage outfall for 1993/94.
    WASTE SURVEY FIELD CAMPS
    Project examining the types and quantities of wastes produced at a field camp 
    during the 1992/93 field season.

4) Other efforts to minimize any environmental effects of wastes and waste 
    management:
    Updated 2nd edition of the BAS Waste Managenet Handbook released in early 199
    Drum crusher installe on RRS Bransfield to crush empty drums removed to 
    Halley V research station.
    Two standard ISO shipping containers purchased for transporting cargo to the 
    Antarctic and waste out of the Antarctic to the Falkland Islands.
    New polypropylene woven compactor sacks ordered for the research stations 
    and RRS Bransfield for use during the 1993/94 season.

Note: A project is underway to assess the field camp waste quantities and categories. Currently quantities cannot be given as such waste is amalgamated with station or ship waste.
There is a priority system for waste removal from camps:
1. hazardous    2. fuel     3. plastics    4. non-hazardous
