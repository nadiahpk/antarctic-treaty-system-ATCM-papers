NEW ZEALAND INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND LOGISTIC CO-OPERATION  

(Submitted by New Zealand)
New Zealand International scientific and 
logistic co-operation 
(Agenda item 13)

New Zealand has continued to maintain an active programme of 
international scientific, logistic and operational co-operation with other 
countries working in the Ross Sea region.

As in past years, the New Zealand programme had a high level of logistic 
co-operation with the USA programme particularly in flight and cargo 
operations to and from Christchurch and helicopter support on the Antarctic 
continent. The Italian programme again staffed an office in Christchurch in 
the early part of the season and provided a third member of the Christchurch 
air support pool. The 3 countries jointly transported over 2000 scientists and 
support staff to McMurdo over the 1993/94 season.

A Statement on Antarctic Co-operation was signed with Chile in October 
1993. It singles out particular areas for co-operative science work. 
The New Zealand and French Governments are in the final phases of 
negotiating an Antarctic co-operation agreement.

Collaborative research projects were carried out with the USA and Italian 
programmes, notably, ozone and fish research with Italian researchers and 
a seismic traverse with USA researchers. The New Zealand and USA 
programmes have also jointly contracted the International Centre for 
Antarctic Information & Research (ICAIR) to carry out a review of Antarctic 
Specially Protected Areas in the Ross Sea region, and the Italian 
programme provided support for review activities in the Terra Nova Bay 
area.

Scientists from Switzerland, Germany, Australia and the UK also visited 
Scott Base and worked with New Zealand researchers.

A major international drilling project (the Cape Robert Project) to take cores 
beneath the Ross Sea for research into Antarctic tectonic and climate history 
is being planned for the 1995/96 and 1996/97 season with Italy, the USA, 
Germany, and the UK.
