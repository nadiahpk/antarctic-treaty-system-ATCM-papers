"Item 17 Hydrographic Surveys and Charting in Antarctica"

REPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANISATION (IHO)
TO THE XVIIIth ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING (ATCM),
KYOTO, JAPAN, APRIL 1994.

Background

1. A full report on the background to the establishment of the IHO's Permanent Working
Group (PWG) on Cooperation in Antarctica and the discussions which took place at its
inaugural meeting in 1992 was presented to the XVIIth ATCM. This Report describes the
progress of the PWG's work since that date and the discussions at the PWG's first meeting
in Valparaiso, Chile on the 19-22 July 1994 at the invitation of the Chilean Government and
hosted by the Chilean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (Servicio Hidrografico y
Oceanografico de la Armada de Chile). A list of attendees is at Appendix 1.

Achievements of the IHO PWG

2. Very good progress has been made to date in progressing the international (INT) chart
scheme of Antarctica. As previously agreed, IHO Member States have been consulted on their
requirements for navigational charts south of 60 S. Valuable input has also been received
from COMNAP.

3. From the statement of requirements the IHB developed a draft INT chart scheme which
closely followed the principles of IHB Special Publication No.48 'Guidance for Regional
Coordinators of INT chart schemes', and copies were forwarded to nations for comment in
June 1993 (see copy at Appendix 2).

4. The proposed INT chart scheme was discussed in Valparaiso and several nations stated
their willingness to participate in the project. Other nations, while accepting the INT chart
scheme in principle, and noting that some additions and modifications would be necessary,
considered that they would have to consider the scheme in more detail before accepting
producer status. It was agreed that detailed comments, including offers to assume producer
status for particular charts, be forwarded to the IHB.

5. The IHB has now coordinated replies. Several nations including Argentina, Australia, Chile,
France, Germany, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Russia, and the United Kingdom
have now agreed to become producers of specific INT charts. A second draft of the INT chart
scheme has now been prepared and is being circulated together with copies of nations replies
to the first draft. It is planned that this scheme will be approved at the next meeting of the
IHO PWG in Buenos Aires in July 1994 and producer status agreed for all INT charts
planned. Once producer status has been assigned there should be free exchange of
hydrographic data to support production. On publication any nation will be free to request
reproduction material from the producer nation and print these charts. The aim is a consistent
series of charts drawn to a common specification, to avoid duplication of effort, and to utilise
hydrographic resources as effectively as possible.
6. A second edition of the IHO Special Publication No.59 ‘Status of Hydrographic Surveys 
and Nautical Charting in Antarctica’(S-59) has been prepared by the IHB and copies have 
been made available to National Managers of Antarctic Programmes at this ATCM. Copies 
have already been distributed to Members of the IHO PWG including SCAR and COMNAP. 
It shows outline information on surveys completed, and more detailed information on the 
specifications used for these surveys is given on a diskette as an annex to S-59. A 
‘Classification of Surveys’ has been added to Part II of the catalogue in order to allow better 
interpretation of data which exists. The classification chosen has been selected according to 
scale and line spacing as defined in IHO Special Publication No.44 ‘IHO Standards for 
Hydrographic Surveys’.

7. The need for hydrographic survey cooperation in Antarctica was stressed at the IHO WG 
meeting in Valparaiso and particularly the need for more cooperation at planning stages to 
maximise resources and minimise duplication. Several nations including Argentina, Australia, 
and the UK confirmed that they planned surveys well in advance from 1 to 5 years ahead, 
although because of the uncertainty of conditions in Antarctica these programmes necessarily 
had to be flexible. It was unanimously agreed that nations wished to cooperate more fully and 
that planning information should be made available, that the IHB should disseminate this 
information, and that nations should subsequently deal bi-laterally in areas of overlapping 
interest.

8. The requirement for source data, other than systematic hydrographic surveys, essential for 
the compilation of navigational charts of Antarctica including geodetic data, air photography, 
satellite imagery, and ocean sounding data was discussed in Valparaiso. It was established that 
nations hold a significant amount of this data which, due to a lack of adequate resources, has 
not yet been published on navigational charts. It was agreed that the existence of this 
information should be publicised but that the IHB should not duplicate the work of other 
scientific agencies such as SCAR, the US DMA data base, and the various space agencies. 
It was agreed that it would, however, be helpful to list these agencies in S-59.

9. Valuable input has been provided by COMNAP. As well as responding positively to the 
IHB request for a statement of requirements for charts and surveys of Antarctica, COMNAP 
has also provided valuable statistical information on the frequency of tourist ships visits to 
Antarctica. Several sites were visited by tourist vessels in excess of twenty times the 1992/93 
season alone. Significantly, it has been established that the seaward approaches to many of 
these sites are inadequately surveyed and charted.

10. The following proposal by Italy was unanimously agreed by IHO Member States and 
incorporated into the minutes of IHO PWG meeting in Valparaiso :-

“ All Member States with a hydrographic surveying and charting capability in Antarctica are 
encouraged to stress nationally that their surveying and charting activities in Antarctica are 
being coordinated through the IHO’s PWG on Cooperation in Antarctica. In particular, it is 
suggested that they emphasise the INT chart scheme initiative and their national contribution 
to it. This international cooperation through the IHO is mandated by Recommendation XV-19 
of the XVth Antarctica Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and thus allows Member States 
to emphasise the international commitment and nature of their Antarctic activities particularly 
when seeking national support for hydrographic surveying and charting priorities and budget”.

The ATCM is invited to note this resolution.
Concluding remarks

11. The excellent progress made to date in progressing the INT chart scheme of Antarctica 
and the positive response by numerous nations to accept producer status for charts in the 
scheme is a clear indication of the good cooperation which has been established between IHO 
Member States.

12. The IHO continues to respond positively to the recommendation which emanated from 
the XVth ATCM and its commitment to charting and surveying in Antarctica. However, as 
stated in the IHO report to the XVIIth ATCM hydrographic surveying and charting are, by 
their nature, extremely expensive undertakings and, in the age of constrained budgets, are 
likely to be seen as soft options for budget reductions. They should rather be viewed as a 
small outlay in return for a major contribution to the safety of life at sea and to the avoidance 
of potential environmental disasters in Antarctica. The ATCM has an important role to play 
in ensuring that the need for continued funding of hydrographic activities is brought to the 
attention of individual national governments.

Statistical evidence clearly shows that tourist traffic is increasing in Antarctica and this must 
also increase the potential for adverse incident. Only by ensuring that hydrographic surveys 
and charting activities continue apace, can the international community seek to minimise that 
potential for adverse impact in Antarctica.

General Background

1.	At the IHO PWG on Cooperation in Antarctica (Ref 1) 'it was proposed and agreed that the 
	IHB would develop a first draft scheme in time for distribution and discussion at the next meeting'.

2.	In preparation of the First Draft of the Antarctic Scheme, MP-004 (Ref 2) Appendix 1 
	'Specifications for Small-Scale INT charts', and IHO Special pub No.48 (Ref 3) Section 3 Annex 1 
	'Scheming of International Charts', have been consulted. The basic principles which have been applied 
	follow SP-48 para 3.2, a summary of which is as follows:-

	(i)	They must be adequate for international shipping.
	(ii)	The specifications must be uniform.
	(iii)	Coverage must be the most adequate possible with a minimum number of charts so 
			as to ensure normal access to important ports*, safely but economically.
	(iv)	The most economical solution for both the user and producer is sought i.e. the 
			minimum number of charts.
	(v)	To enquire of Hydrographic Offices intentions for national schemes.
		•	In the Antarctic Scheme 'permanent scientific Bases' have been the primary 
			consideration in lieu of 'important ports'.

3.	In addition to the guidelines given in SP-48, numerous nations charts, chart catalogues and 
	SP-59 (Ref 6) have been consulted. Where possible existing national chart limits and scales have been 
	included in the proposed IHO scheme as well as a few new charts planned by Chile and the UK, the 
	details of which were tabled at the IHO Conference in Bonn in Oct 91.*	Due to the time factor 
	proposals made in reply to IHO letter (Ref 4) requested by the 15th June have not yet been included 
	and are for consideration at the July meeting in Valparaiso.

COMNAP information on charting requirements coming from various nations has also been 
taken into account, except Elephant island (request from Brazil), Mc Ferlane straits and 
Melchior Islands.

4. Chart Numbering. The Secretary IHO Chart Specification Committee has been consulted wi[?] 
regard to the allocation of chart numbers.
In accordance with normal INT principles chart numbers have been allocated to the various scales as 
follows :-

        scale 1:10M (million)              to be numbered     10 -    99
        scale 1:2M (equivalent to 1:3.5M)  to be numbered    900 -   999
        scale 1:1M and larger              to be numbered   9000 -  9999

5. The draft scheme proposed is intended to be used as a basis for discussion. Producer status 
for each chart has been left for decision at Valparaiso. It is assumed however that countries with 
permanent Bases will wish to assume responsibility for any large scale INT charts in the vicinity of 
those Bases.

6. INT charts at two scales, 1:10M at the Equator and 1:3.5M at 22°30', were agreed and several 
IHO members were assigned as 'Producer' nations. These charts are all published. Antarctica and 
the Southern Ocean were not considered in this scheme. The UK, however, has produced a series 
circumpolar charts at 1:10M (at the equator) and also three charts at 1.3.5M (at 22°30') of the S. Atlantic 
and the Antarctic Peninsula, which they have now submitted to the IHO to include in the International 
scheme (IHO letter Ref 5 refers). It is appropriate to consider this proposal at IHO PWGCA.

7. The UK 1:10 million scheme fits in well with the existing IHO INT 1:10M scheme, and it is 
therefore proposed, that this is accepted. The UK is content to continue being responsible for their 
maintenance but recognises that there are more appropriate member states who may be willing to act 
as their custodian. Long term maintenance can be considered at Valparaiso.

8. The three UK charts of the S. Atlantic at scale 1:3.5M (BA's 4212-4214 inc.) overlap with the 
existing IHO 1:3.5M charts 609 and 200. However, the true scale of the 1:3.5M charts at 70° is 1:1.3M 
approx. It would seem sensible in such high latitudes to plan an INT series of charts at a more 
meaningful scale and which at the same time gives coverage of all the Antarctic coastline. Chart 
schemes at both small scale 1:3.5M and medium scale 1:1.5M or equivalent are considered 
in Antarctic Waters. Complete coverage of Antarctic Waters is presently given by only two countries 
in their national series at an equivalent scale. Russia has a series at 1:2M (mid lat 66° and 69°); the US 
has a scheme at 1:1.5M (at 70°). Other countries have limited scale cover in their areas of interest (for 
details see SP-59).

9. A series of circumpolar charts at scale 1:2M (mid lat 66°) is proposed for passages and 
landfalls and to give continuity at one scale. The scheme planned is similar to both the Russian and 
the US series, except, unlike the Russian series, one common mid latitude has been chosen. The US 
series has not been chosen en bloc as several charts are larger than AO size. The proposed 1:2M 
cheme ...[?] pt...[?] 10 charts, the ...[?] its of wh...[?] are g...[?]e at Annex B1 and ...[?]wn on Ind...[?]x S[?]eei 
No 1. All charts are, with the excepti[?]n of 900 and 907, in landscape format to keep the number of 
charts to the minimum.

Charting Scheme for Medium and Large Scale Charts of Antarctica
(See Index Sheets Nos 1 and 2 and Annexes B2 & B3)

Charts at Medium Scale

10.    SP-48 para 3.3 defines 'medium scales' as corresponding to the class of charts extending from 
the greatest scale at which coast coverage is continuous to the 'small scale.' It also states that the 
generally accepted range of scales is 1:1.5M to 1:750T (thousand) for passages and landfalls, and 1:500T 
to 1:150T for coastal vessels. The chosen scale is dependent on several factors including, type of 
shipping, morphology, currents, scale of adjoining charts etc.

11.    The 1:2M series referred to above is designed for passages and landfalls. A continuous coastal 
series of charts at 1:500T or larger is considered to be unnecessary for international shipping in 
Antarctica, as passages are usually made directly between the Southern Continents direct to scientific 
Bases or other planned destinations. An exception to this is the West coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, 
where they are required for approach and coastal passage. Individual charts at scale 1:500T are 
required for all Antarctic Waters in the approaches to each of the Scientific Bases, and charts at this 
scale may also be required by individual countries in their national series for passage between Bases.

Medium Scale charts of the Antarctic Peninsula (including South Shetland and South Orkney 
Islands)

12.    (i)     As part of the overall 1:2M scheme described above, one chart (INT 907) is schemed 
to cover the Peninsula to replace existing and proposed national charts.

       (ii)    A proposed INT scheme of three charts at 1:500T for the West coast of the Antarctic 
Peninsula is planned as shown on Index Sheet No 2 with limits given at Annex B3. 
Several nations currently chart the area at this scale (see SP-59) and so the INT scheme 
proposed should avoid duplication. An INT scheme for the East coast of the 
Peninsula is considered unnecessary due to permanent ice conditions.

       (iii)   In addition to the 1:500T scale several nations currently chart the North and West 
coasts of the Peninsula and S. Shetlands at scale 1:200T. Additionally, (as tabled at 
Bonn Oct 91), the UK has plans for a new series of charts at scale 1:150T of the N. and 
W. coasts, the first chart of which (BA 225) was published this year. As the UK 
scheme gives improved scale and coverage, particularly for the difficult inner route 
down the W. coast of the Peninsula, it has been tentatively included in the IHO 
scheme. Two charts at 1:200T have been retained for the S. Shetlands and one chart 
at 1:150T for S. Orkneys.

13.    For areas other than the Antarctic Peninsula it is more convenient to treat medium scale charts 
at 1:500T and larger in the approaches to Bases with the larger scale charts (see below).

Charts at Medium and Large Scale in the Approaches to Bases
(See Index Sheets 1 and 2, chart limits at Annexes B2 & B3, list of Bases at Annex C)

14.    The principles adopted have been to chart all the permanent bases at appropriate large scale(s) 
and where possible to include in the scheme the scale and limits of the national chart of the country 
responsible for the Base. This has not always been possible where, for example, Bases of two countries 
are close together, or where a nation has several charts of the area, or even where there is no chart at 
all. In these situations one chart at an appropriate scale has been chosen. Additionally an approach 
chart has been included at an appropriate scale, usually at 1:500T.

                                                                                           3
Charts at Large scale of the Antarctic Peninsula

15.     Charts of the Bases have been chosen as described in para 14 above. Approach charts are all 
        at scale 1:500T, and 1:150T or 1:200T, as described in para 12 above.

16.     Four additional charts (9103, 9104, 9107 & 9108) have been schemed at scale 1:50T to allow safe 
        passage through difficult and restricted areas of the inner route of the W. coast of the Peninsula.

17.     Several nations have a requirement for, and currently chart, numerous anchorages in the 
        Peninsula. Of these, only those at Deception Island and Port Lockroy have been included in the 
        scheme as they are considered to be of particular interest to research and cruise vessels. However, 
        if there is a requirement for other frequently used anchorages, then these could be incorporated into 
        the IHO scheme as sets of plans or as insets to charts already planned.

                                                                                                                               4
