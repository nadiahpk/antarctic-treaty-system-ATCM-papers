COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE IHO

(Submitted by South Africa)
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE IHO

(Information Paper Submitted by South Africa)

In the Report of the IHO submitted to the XVIII ATCM as document INFO 20, contains the notation under National Requirements for Hydrographic Surveying and Charting as collected by COMNAP

"South Africa (1992) - No need for new Hydrographic Charts"

By way of explanation, Treaty Parties are advised that the Treaty area between 6 degrees E and 6 degrees W has been extensively, almost exhaustively surveyed. All this large volume of data has been made available to the IHO by the Hydrographer of the South African Navy and is therefore available for utilization by the IHO Permanent Working Group on Cooperation in Antarctica.
