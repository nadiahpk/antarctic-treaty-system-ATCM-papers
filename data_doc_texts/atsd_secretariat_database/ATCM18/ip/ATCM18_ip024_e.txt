ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

1   Introduction

Since XVII ATCM in November 1992 the following activities of
WMO have occurred which are relevant to Antarctic Treaty
matters.

(a)  The Executive Council of WMO discussed Antarctic items at
its meeting in June 1993.

(b)  The WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic
Meteorology (EC-WGAM) held its 6th Session in November
1993 (the previous meeting being in December 1990).

Copies of the report of (b) have been distributed to the
national Permanent Representatives of WMO and through them to
Managers of National Antarctic Programs.

Information resulting from WMO activities which may be useful
to ATCM is presented in the following sections.

2   Synoptic Station Networks, Automatic Weather Stations and
Observation Programs.

The Sixth Session of EC-WGAM after examining the existing
surface and upper air observation programs in Antarctica has
recommended to WMO that the 'Basic Synoptic Network in the
Antarctic' consist of the stations listed in Attachment 1. It
should be noted that this network now includes some of the
increasing number of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) now
deployed in Antarctica and some planned to be installed within
the Antarctic Geospace Observatory Network (AGONET).  It
should also be noted that it includes some stations where
operations have been temporarily suspended and some where full
operation of the observation program (eg at all standard
hours) is not being currently effected. EC-WGAM urged that
high priority be attached to reopening stations which have
been closed and for Members of WMO to consider the possibility
of co-operating with other Members in sharing the costs of
functioning stations. The Working Group also urged the full
implementation of the observing program at existing stations
and the further use of AWS either at new sites (particularly
in the Pacific sector of West Antarctica) or to replace former
conventional stations which have been closed.

Members were also urged to develop in the Antarctic new
components of the Global Observing System (GOS) including
Automated Shipboard Aerological Programme (ASAP), Automated
Aircraft Meteorological Data Reporting (AMDAR),  and
improvements in satellite sensors.

3 Establishment of an 'International Programme for 
Antarctic Buoys'

EC-WGAM noted and strongly supported the development of this 
proposal within the World Climate Research Programme. The 
buoy programme has the potential to greatly improve the 
Antarctic data network by the deployment of observational 
buoys within the Antarctic seasonal sea ice zone. Plans for 
the launching of approximately 15 buoys per year for the next 
5 years have been announced with the aim of eventually 
establishing a satisfactory array of some 50 buoys with a 
spacing of around 500km.

4     Antarctic Telecommunications

EC-WGAM reviewed the report of an Expert Meeting on Antarctic 
Telecommunications held in October 1991 and endorsed its 
recommendations. The current situation with respect to 
Antarctic data transfer is shown in Figures 1 and 2.

These figures indicate the increasing use of direct satellite 
communication to deliver meteorological data from Antarctica 
to locations outside Antarctica where they are inserted into 
the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) for use by all 
countries carrying out Antarctic analysis and research. 
Automatic weather stations and drifting buoys also deliver 
data in this way. The Expert Meeting on Antarctic 
Telecommunciations has recommended that this method of 
transmission be extended but recognised that there are areas 
and stations in Antarctica where HF radio communication has 
proved reliable and these systems will be continued at least 
for the present.

The older system of mother/daughter stations and frequent 
communications among Antarctic bases for the exchange of 
meteorological and other data is rapidly changing through the 
improved technology and the desire of many national 
expeditions, on economic grounds to reduce the number of 
communications personnel on the continent. The success of 
this direct link satellite communications system depends not 
only on the efficiency of the methods of transmission of data 
from Antarctica to the GTS but also on its ability to provide 
the consolidated data and meteorological analyses back to the 
locations in Antarctica where it is needed for operational 
purposes. The successful development of meteorological 
services in the Antarctic depends on the latter process and 
these services will be addressed in an information paper to be 
provided for discussion under Agenda Item 15.

Antarctic telecommunications procedures are documented in the 
WMO Manual on the Global Telecommunication System and further 
relevant information is included in the Antarctic 
Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM) and the Antarctic 
Flight Information Manual (AFIM) both produced by COMNAP.

The delivery of Antarctic meteorological data is still far 
from perfect but WMO, by regular data monitoring and Expert 
communications meetings, is endeavouring to improve operating 
procedures and facilitate the introduction of appropriate new 
technology.

5      WMO Studies of the Ozone Layer over Antarctica

The measurement of atmospheric ozone over Antarctica is 
pursued under WMO supervised calibration and data exchange as 
part of the Global Ozone Observing System (GOOS). Currently 
the following stations are carrying out ozone measurements in 
Antarctica.

Mirny, T.
Molodezhnaya, T.
Neumeyer, T, V.
Novolazarevskaya, T.
Scott Base, T.
South Pole, T, V.
Syowa, T, V.

WMO has continued to urge the operators of existing and 
planned stations to maintain them at a high standard and to 
seek to increase the number of stations performing vertical 
distribution measurements. In particular, the provision of 
near real time data to the WMO Ozone Data Centre in Toronto 
during the August to December period followed by the deposit 
of complete data sets.

WMO has also encouraged ancillary measurements of ozone-
related chemical species and complete sets of spectral 
radiation measurements.

The increasing international concern resulting from the 
observation of the size and intensity of the Antarctic Ozone 
'hole' makes it essential that appropriate high quality 
observations be maintained to support research activity.

6      Long Term Planning

At its Sixth Session in November 1993 EC WGAM developed a 
draft plan for Antarctic meteorological activities (as part of 
the WMO Long Term Plan for 1996-2005).

The plan addresses future developments in observations 
communications, data processing, service provision, scientific 
and technological advances, international collaboration and 
specific objectives and plans. It will be submitted to WMO 
Twelfth Congress in 1995.

SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTIC
RESEARCH (SCAR)

FIRST REGIONAL OBSERVING STUDY OF THE TROPOSPHERE
(FROST)

FROST is an international project being organised by SCAR to study the meteorology of
the Antarctic and validate the numerical analyses and forecasts over the high southern
latitudes. It is based around three one-month Special Observing Periods (SOP) arranged for
July 1994, 16 October to 15 November 1994 and January 1995 during which
comprehensive data sets will be created of observations from the Antarctic and high
quality analyses prepared. These analyses will be used in an intercomparison of
operational numerical analyses and for studies of Antarctic tropospheric processes. The
data and analyses collected during the FROST experiment will be freely available to the
meteorological community.

The data to be collected will consist of in-situ observations from conventional surface and
upper-air reporting stations, ships, automatic weather stations and drifting buoys. Because
of the very limited number of research stations over the continent, FROST will be heavily
reliant on satellite observations and by far the largest volume of data to be collected will
come from the polar orbiting satellites. At present it is planned that we will collect remote
sensing data consisting of 1 km horizontal resolution visible and infra-red imagery from
the NOAA satellites, temperature and humidity profiles from the TIROS Operational
Vertical Sounder, passive microwave imagery from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager,
surface winds over the ice-free ocean from the ERS-1 scatterometer. However, other
satellite data will be archived and used if available. With the 1 km resolution imagery
alone amounting to several gigabytes of data per day every effort will be made to try and
get hardcopy prints of the imagery to limit the re-processing of large amounts of data. The
satellite data will also be processed to give a number of higher level products including
precipitation over the ocean and nephanalyses.

High quality manual surface and upper air analyses will be produced for the three SOP
using all the collected data. The operational products from the main analysis centres will
provide the basis for these, but they will be revised in the light of the data not available in
near real time. Satellite data will be especially important in this as will the AWS
observations.

It is hoped that model analysis and forecast fields from the UK Meteorological Office, the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology and the US National Meteorological Center will be obtained in both hardcopy and computer compatible form for use in the re-

analysis process and for the production of statistics respectively. One of the major outcomes of the experiment will be greater knowledge of the failings of the numerical analyses which will be obtained from assessing the performance of the operational schemes in various situations and by carrying out detailed case studies of particular events.

FROST is clearly a major undertaking and the work will have to be carried out by a number of groups around the world working in close cooperation. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will be the main archiving centre and they will assemble a computer data base of all the in-situ data and hold the tapes of satellite products and model fields. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology will prepare the manual surface and upper air charts from the three SOP with the University of Bonn processing the passive microwave imagery and deriving precipitation estimates over the ocean. The intercomparison of analyses will be carried out jointly by BAS. the Bureau of Meteorology and the Byrd Polar Research Center. Ohio State University.

It is hoped that all the nations involved in meteorological observing in the Antarctic will be able to contribute to the project by making additional observations during the SOPs. These could either be additional surface measurements or radio sonde releases, or the deployment of extra AWS or drifting buoys. To help in the collection of data not on the GTS National Points of Contact (NPC) have been established in each country with an Antarctic observing programme and a list of the NPCs is attached at Appendix 1. It is hoped that the NPCs will be able to provide data not transmitted on the GTS.

As the first SOP is less than one year away activity on the FROST project is increasing. The Antarctic data on the GTS are being assessed over three periods scheduled for 5-9 July 1993, 1-15 February 1994 (to coincide with the WMO Specific Monitoring of the WWW (Antarctic)) and 13-17 June 1994. During these periods the Antarctic data on the GTS will be monitored at Cambridge (linked to the Bracknell hub) and at Hobart so that any problems in the data transmission from stations in the Antarctic can be detected. Work is also progressing on the establishment of the observational data base to be held in Cambridge and on obtaining model fields in a convenient form.

FROST offers the opportunity to assemble comprehensive data sets of Antarctic observational and model data for extended periods throughout the year. The data should be of great value to those interested in numerical analysis, forecasting, atmospheric variability, precipitation and synoptic and mesoscale weather systems. It is hoped that those involved in meteorological observing in the Antarctic will be able to provide their data to make this a successful project.
