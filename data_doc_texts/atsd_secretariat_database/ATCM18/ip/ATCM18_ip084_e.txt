OPENING ADDRESS BY DR. EMMANUEL GOUNARIS
HEAD OF DELEGATION OF GREECE TO
THE XVIIIth ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING,
KYOTO,11-22 APRIL 1994

Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the Greek delegation, I would like to congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the Eighteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

May I also through you, Mr. Chairman express my gratitude to the Government of Japan, for hosting this Meeting in the historic city of Kyoto.

Mr. Chairman

This Meeting has a number of important items to examine and to decide. Those items which my delegation considers to be of special importance, are the following:

1. The progress which has been made regarding the ratification of the Madrid Protocol of 1991 on Environmental Protection and its implementation.

2. The formulation of a liability Annex in accordance with article 16 of the Madrid Protocol.

3. The establishment of a permanent small Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.

4. The formation and functionning of the Committee for the Environmental Protection, in accordance with article 11 of the Madrid Protocol.

5. The establishment of a Tourism Policy in the framework of the Madrid Protocol, regarding tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area.
Mr. Chairman

Greece has already translated the Madrid Protocol into Greek and has already submitted it for ratification to the Parliament. I hope during the following three months to be this process completed.

Regarding the formulation of a liability Annex my delegation thinks that during the Experts Meeting in Heidelberg under the able leadership of Prof. Dr. Wolfrum a progress has already been made. I hope to see during this Meeting a further progress to this item. Without such a Annex the Antarctic Area it will be in danger!

As far as the establishment of a small permanent Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is concerned, my delegation would like to see resolved this issue during this Meeting. Furthermore regarding the location of this Secretariat my delegation support the candidacy of Argentina.

Regarding the formation and functioning of the Committee for Environmental Protection, my delegation hopes that this Consultative Meeting will give a priority to the establishment of this Committee.

Finally Mr. Chairman, regarding the establishment of a tourism policy, covering tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica, my delegation is satisfied with the existing rules and regulations in the framework of the Madrid Protocol of 1991 and its Annexes. However, my delegation could support the idea of the creation of a group to examine in more detail this item.

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
