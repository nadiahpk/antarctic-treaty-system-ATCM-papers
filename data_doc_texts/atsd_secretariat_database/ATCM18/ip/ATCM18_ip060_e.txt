1    SUMMARY

Seasonal variations in the climate of the Dry Valleys have resulted in raised levels of Lake Vanda, in 
the Wright Valley. Recent increases now threaten to inundate or partially inundate the New Zealand 
Antarctic Programme's Vanda Station.

Lake Vanda has special values, including its ultra-oligotrophic status. The New Zealand Antarctic 
Programme is concerned to take steps to minimise contamination of the Lake by inundation of land 
that may contain residuals from 20 years of station activity and to monitor the impact of any 
contamination that does occur.

This Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) outlines the process that the New Zealand Antarctic 
Programme intends to adopt in the decommissioning of Vanda Station.

The main points arising from this IEE are:

•   That Vanda Station should be removed in the near future due to the threat of inundation by rising 
    lake level.

•   That the scale of remedial actions be determined by studies of the nature and level of any 
    contamination and from advise on the likely impact of this contamination on scientific values of 
    Lake Vanda.

•   That the Ross Dependency Research Committee monitor the progress of decommissioning.

•   That a comprehensive environmental evaluation is not required.

The Draft Initial Environmental Evaluation was initiated by the Ross Dependency Research 
Committee's Antarctic Environmental Assessment and Review Panel. (The AEARP was 
disestablished before the IEE was completed). The draft was completed in October 1993 and was 
circulated to interested parties within New Zealand. Four responses were received by the Ross 
Dependency Research Committee and were taken into account in the preparation of this final Initial 
Environmental Evaluation.

2         INTRODUCTION

The Dry Valleys of South Victoria Land contain a number of unique lake systems. Vanda Station is 
located on the shores of Lake Vanda. On present trends the Station can be expected to be at least 
partially inundated within the next 2-5 years (Figure 1).

Lake Vanda in the Wright Valley is the largest of the region's lakes. It is 8 km long, 2.5 km wide and 
over 70 m deep. The lake has no outlet. It is fed by the Onyx River that drains the Wright Lower 
Glacier, and other glaciers on the sides of Wright Lower Valley. Sub-surface flows of saline water are 
also known to flow into the lake, contributing very little water but considerable amounts of dissolved 
material.

In 1968/69 the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme established a base (Vanda Station) 
beside Lake Vanda and as part of its programme, began monitoring climate and lake levels. Two 
decades of records show that the annual ablation rate is relatively constant at about 0.3 metres per 
year. However, Onyx River flows show a high degree of variability. In some summers the Onyx River 
hardly flows while in others peak flows in excess of 15 m3/sec have been recorded. Flows depend 
on the Wright Lower Glacier melt rates. These in turn depend on local climate variations (and 
postulated possible regional climate variations). Because the lake has no outfall its level is determined 
by the balance between annual inflows and ablation plus evaporation. Figure 1 shows that in the last 
two decades there have been a series of lake level rises that have taken the lake to seven metres 
above its 1970 level.

The problem for the New Zealand Antarctic Programme (NZAP) is the removal/relocation of the station 
and mitigation, to the degree practical, of any residual impacts of past activities at the site.

The New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme, which operated Vanda Station, maintained a 
comparatively high standard of waste management throughout the period of its operation. However 
management practices were less strict in the earlier years of operation than they have now and it is likely 
that some contamination from various actions and domestic activities will have occurred.

Vanda is a unique lake system. It is one of the world's most ultra-oligotrophic lakes and has been 
intensively studied. Some 87 scientific papers have been published from work supported by the New 
Zealand Antarctic Programme. The responses to the question "how can liquid water exist in a region 
where mean temperatures are in the order of minus 20°C?" have yielded much information about the 
oligotrophic status of the lake and its thermal stratification. From a limnologist's point of view it is 
extremely important that this unique system be maintained in its pristine condition.

The objectives in carrying out an environmental assessment on the decommissioning of Vanda 
Station, as documented by this IEE, are:

•   To ensure, that in the event that the waters of Lake Vanda inundate the Station, there will be 
    an absolute minimum of human induced environmental change to the lake system.

•   To ensure that if change is unavoidable the nature and extent of that change is understood 
    and documented.

•   To submit its proposals for protecting Lake Vanda to national and international review.

3       THE LAKE VANDA ENVIRONMENT

Lake Vanda
Lake Vanda is a thermally stratified oligotrophic ice covered lake with a volume of about 0.86 cubic 
kilometres. A 3.5 metres thick layer of ice covers the lake all year. However the ice at the edge of the 
lake melts in summer forming a shallow moat 1-100m wide which refreezes in winter to a depth of 
about 3 metres. Below the ice there is negligible mixing and the lake contains at least 12 density 
stratified layers (figure 2). These layers are between about 0.1 and 20 metres thick, and each is more 
saline and slightly warmer than the layer above. At the bottom of the deepest part of the lake the water 
is three times saltier than sea water. The remarkably warm temperature of 25°C in this layer is caused 
by solar heating. Temperatures cool into the sediment beneath.





FIGURE 2.      Internal temperature and density structure of Lake Vanda (from Chinn in Hatherton 
1991)

The lake consists of two ecosystems. The extreme physical stability of the lake has allowed various 
micro-organisms to occupy discrete layers where light, temperature and chemical conditions are 
exactly suited for their growth.

The upper lake ecosystem occupies the upper 50 metres of nutrient-poor fresh water and resembles 
that in other oligotrophic Antarctic lakes which are also limited by winter darkness and ice cover. Algae 
belonging to eight different genera have been identified and zooplankton include single species of 
each of the ciliates, tardigrades and rotifers. A simple but diverse benthic community is also found in 
the fresh water layer, dominated by mats of cyanobacteria or algae, with protozoan and simple 
invertebrates also present, and some aquatic mosses.

6
The lower lake ecosystem occurs below about 50-54 metres at which the salinity is 1.5 times that of 
sea water. Various specific micro-organisms including nitrifying bacteria and alga form in discrete 
layers from here to the lake floor (figure 2) and layer biota appear to be dependent on one another.

Vanda Station is located on the crest of a gently undulating topography. Below the surface lag layer of 
gravel and small rocks, the soil is composed of a thin layer of loose rock debris and sand from 0-0.3 
metres thick. This overlies granodiorite blocks and bedrock or erosion-resistant lamprophyre dykes 
intruded into the granodiorite. The underlying rock material is fractured to massive.

The ground surface is frozen for most of the year except during late November to early February and 
soil forming processes are very slow. Mean annual temperatures at Vanda Station are close to -20°C. 
The active (seasonally unfrozen) layer is about 0.4 metres thick so at depths greater than this the 
ground is permanently frozen. Seasonal climate cycles drive sub-surface temperature gradients with 
temperatures at 0.2 metres becoming colder than -40°C in midwinter. Soil moisture content is very 
low (<10%) away from the lake although it increases to 100% at the lake shore. Soil biota are very 
sparse although microbial ecosystems are probably present and active during summer. Parts of the 
Onyx River are colonised by dense microbial mat communities, comprised mostly of cyanobacteria.

The Lake-Land Interface.

The interface between lake and dry land is a complex zone. At any point in this zone conditions in the 
top 3-4 metres of the ground surface are dominated by seasonal wetting and drying, freezing and 
thawing cycles. These conditions will change naturally as the lake, rising at an average rate of 0.7 
metres per year, inundates that point.

The presence of the lake creates a damp relatively warm zone in the soil around the shore. Thin films 
of moisture surround soil particles even in winter with temperatures as low as -66°C because 
dissolved material in the moisture depresses its freezing point. Evaporation from the surface tends to 
wick this soil moisture upwards depositing dissolved material out of solution on the surface most 
noticeably in late summer and autumn. However movement of sub-surface moisture is complex, 
dependant also on sub-surface permeability, porosity, composition, diffusion coefficients and other 
properties as well as temperature and moisture gradients.

Inundation by lake water and seasonal moat ice will naturally alter the amount and movement of sub-
surface moisture and any soluble material in contact with it. Some of this soluble material may dissolve 
and potentially enter the lake. At least three scenarios could be envisaged as any soluble introduced 
material at or near the ground surface is dissolved at the shore in the shallow moat zone. It may be 
mixed by wind and wave action and be diluted so as to be undetectable. Lack of mixing could result in 
water slightly denser than its surroundings flowing slowly down the lake bed and being diluted by 
mixing until it reached a layer in the lake of equal density. Alternatively the dissolved material could 
remain within the lake bed.

For hydrologists/climatologists the inward flowing river, and lake with no outflow offers interesting 
opportunities for mass balance research. Although climate research is of a regional nature, the two 
decade record confers significant added value to each additional year of record.

For earth scientists Vanda Station is a valuable base for field studies of the region's complex 
geological, geomorphic and glacial history. The waters and sediment of the lake have been studied to 
extract such information.

Biologists and micro-biologists have also studied the biological processes and biota of the lake and 
surrounding areas. Of special significance is the complex layering of the lake allowing for a highly 
stable vertically structured environment, providing globally unique habitats for micro-organisms. The 
lack of predators in the food web also offers a unique environment for the study of plankton 
communities.

For geochemists the uncontaminated character of Lake Vanda makes it a unique benchmark system, 
although some levels of the lake may have been contaminated by early studies using radioisotopes.

7
Other national programmes have interests in the Vanda region. The United States Antarctic Program (USAP) and its participating agencies, has made extensive use of the region and more limited use of Vanda Station for geological, hydrological, space analogue and climate research. The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) has 15 years of geochemical research experience in the region. Scientists from other nations have also worked in the region. USAP has recently approved an ecological long term environmental research (LTER) programme for the Dry Valley region. Some increased research effort on the Lake Vanda system can be expected over the next decade from this initiative alone.

The presence of Vanda Station has encouraged its use as a stop-over for helicopter crews operating in the area. The Vanda Swim Club has also attracted passing field parties to the station.

The region also has a history of non-government activities. Greenpeace has visited the station both overland and by helicopter. Tour ship operators have landed parties in the region (mainly for photography). There has also been limited "flight-seeing" in the Wright Valley by fixed wing and helicopter aircraft. This type of activity can be expected to increase.

In summary, when the region's existence values are considered from several points of view, they are dominated by a single concern: the unique "pristine" characteristics of Lake Vanda.

4       METHODS

The process and methods used to prepare the Initial Environmental Evaluation follow those 
presented in the "Antarctic Environmental Assessment Process - Practical Guidelines" Bologna, Italy 
(20/6/91) and revised Washington DC (4/3/92). The draft IEE was initiated by members of the 
independent Antarctic Environmental Assessment and Review Panel (AEARP) which subsequently 
has been disestablished

The draft IEE was completed in October 1993 and was circulated for comment later in that year. An 
independent review of the draft has been carried out by Dr Clive Howard-Williams (NIWA Christchurch) 
for the RDRC.

Comments on the draft IEE have been received from the New Zealand Committee of IUCN Members, 
Greenpeace, Ministry for the Environment and J R Keys. Where they relate to the content of the draft 
IEE comments have been taken into account in preparing the final IEE. The recommendations of the 
independent reviewer have also been incorporated into this document.

The final IEE has been prepared by the New Zealand Antarctic Programme.

5       VANDA STATION

Operation

The station was established during the 1968-1969 austral summer. Since establishment it has, until 
1991/92 austral summer, been occupied for the period November to late January of each summer 
season. A team of four has wintered three times (1969, 1970, 1974). During these periods extensive 
scientific programmes were carried out in the physical sciences (meteorology, seismology, 
geomagnetics). In the summer months Vanda Station has been primarly a support base for field 
science parties in the immediate area. The Station was staffed each year normally with two support 
personal and two to three science personnel. Since 1990 there has been a marked decrease in the 
amount of science requiring support at Vanda Station. Operations there have decreased to a point 
where during the 1992/93 summer season the Station was not staffed by NZAP employees though it 
was used to support science in the immediate area.

Impacts of Activities at Vanda Station

The use of the buildings and other areas at Vanda Station is shown in Figure 3. This use has 
disturbed the site by trampling and vehicle movement, excavations, storage of consumables, 
accidental spillages and limited forms of waste disposal. Although it was recognised early on that 
Vanda needed to be an environmentally clean Station, all human and other wastes were not removed 
from the area in the early years. Locations of known potential sites of significant contamination are 
shown in Figure 4.

6     THE PROPOSAL AND ALTERNATIVES

Options

The probable inundation of the Vanda facilities presents NZAP with three main alternatives in 
considering the future of Vanda Station. These options are considered below:

a    Do nothing
The option of doing nothing at Vanda Station raises a number of environmental and 
operational difficulties. Trends based on past records indicate that the Station buildings are 
likely to be inundated in the next 2-5 years. Science activity at Lake Vanda is expected to 
continue in the near future with subsequent demand for facilities. Operating at Vanda Station 
on its current site with this level of uncertainty regarding the level of the lake is unacceptable. 
In addition it is possible that the elevated ground where the Station is currently sited could 
become an island further impacting on the effective operation of science programmes.

The remaining buildings at Vanda Station represent a capital asset that can be utilised for 
science support elsewhere. However most significant is the environmental impact that could 
arise from inundation of the Vanda Station site and buildings. Lake Vanda is valued as a 
pristine environment (see section 3). NZAP is committed to ensuring that in the event that 
the site is inundated any human induced change on the lake system is minimised. With 
removal of buildings, other structures and appropriate site clean up NZAP can achieve this 
objective in one-two seasons. Consequently the "do nothing" option is unacceptable.

b    Remove all buildings from Lake Vanda
The removal of all buildings from Lake Vanda will ensure that NZAP will meet its commitments 
to the Vanda environment. However, demand for science support facilities in the vicinity of 
the Lake is expected to continue at least in the medium term. Subject to an environmental 
evaluation, relocated buildings at Lake Vanda could continue to provide this support while 
ensuring that impacts are minimised.

c    Remove all buildings from current site but relocate science support facilities 
in the vicinity at Lake Vanda.

This option involves the complete removal of Vanda Station from its current position and the 
relocation of either two exisitng Vanda buildings (laboratory and accommodation buildings), or 
other relocatble huts, to another site in the vicinity of Lake Vanda. Any buildings not reused 
at Vanda will be removed to Marble Point and then Scott Base.

Any new site for the relocated buildings must be sufficiently elevated above current lake level 
and be unlikely to be inundated by lake waters in the foreseeable future.

The relocated facility would be of a different scale and type compared to the existing Vanda 
Station. Vanda Station operated as a permanent support facility with summer station staff. It is 
envisaged that any new facility would involve just two science support buildings and operate 
on a similar scale and nature as, for example, the Bratina Island huts.

It is anticipated that there will be continuing science activities in the vicinity of Lake Vanda for 
at least three years. These include investigations into the sources and sinks of nutrients in 
the Onyx River and effects of the Onyx River on surface waters of Lake Vanda.

The main arguement for retaining buildings at Lake Vanda is to ensure that there is an 
appropriate and high standard of support for science activities in the area. Any relocation of 
buildings at Vanda will, however, be subject to a separate environment evaluation.

12
The Proposal

The activities which need to be undertaken to decommission Vanda Station on its current site are as follows:

*   Removal of direct hazards for lake water, sediment, biota and ice. These are all facilities and equipment above ground, ie buildings, antennae, towers, and associated equipment;
*   Identification of contaminated sites and remedial action if necessary and feasible to minimise leaching and/or diffusion of soil contaminants into the lake system;
*   Identification of potential hazards to the lake's scientific values, carried out in consultation with scientists from the National Institute for Water and Atmosphere with previous experience in the area;
*   Removal of sub-surface installations as far as practical, ie buried power and communication cables, building anchors etc, that may pose future hazards to the lake system;
*   Minimisation of further impact to soils and lake system;
*   Restoration of the natural surface as close as possible to the original form;
*   Monitoring of any ongoing impact and the effectiveness of decommissioning actions.

The process of removing Vanda from the current site is planned to take place in steps with the majority of work carried out over the 1994/95 summer season. Delays longer than this could result in more significant impacts if contaminated sites or buildings are inundated. Some preliminary work was carried out in the 1993/94 season as outlined in the draft IEE. This work comprised of the removal of materials or contaminants posing an immediate threat to the scientific values of Lake Vanda (see Appendices I, II, III & IV). Work concentrated on sites with a possibility of being flooded in January 1994 with resultant leaching or diffusion of contaminants into lake waters. Three auxiliary buildings, no longer in use at Vanda, were also removed.

Further remedial action will be carried out in the 1994/95 season concentrating on sites of significant contamination where remedial action has not yet been carried out. It is intended that a further survey to confirm the extent of soil and water contamination of the Vanda Station site be carried out following building removal in 1994/95.

Minor sites of contamination unlikely to effect the scientific and environmental values of Lake Vanda will be left for natural processes to deal with.

Major Steps to Decommissioning Vanda Station

Step 1
Summer of 1992/93 - site inspections carried out to locate sites of known and suspected contamination. These sites are known from records and from interviews conducted with all base managers in the Station's 20 year history.

Step 2
Geochemical samples taken from all known contaminated sites during 1992/93. Contamination sites mapped. Contaminants from these sites are known to include: fuels, battery acid, photographic chemicals, waste water and urine. Samples were analysed for heavy metals, total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The results have been important in determining the strategies necessary to prevent contamination of lake waters.

Step 3
Release of draft IEE in November 1993 including timetable  and plans for building removal and timetable for actions to prevent lake contamination.

Step 4
Summer 1993/94. Preparation for decommissioning including removal and return to Scott Base of unnecessary food store and accommodation huts and significantly contaminated soil identified in 1992/93 in immediate threat of inundation from rising lake levels.

1 3
Step 5
Release of final IEE both nationally (interested parties) and internationally (ATCM information paper and circulation to COMNAP members).

Step 6
Summer 1994/95 - removal of Station from existing site and additional soil survey over station site.

Four-six people will be stationed at Vanda to:
    •   demolish workshop and mess buildings and any other remaining structures, remove all 
        anchors as much as possible;
    •   package materials in 500 kg helicopter loads;
    •   prevent wind blown dispersion of materials;
    •   collect all surface litter, including particles originating from food, building materials, crates, 
        packaging and wrapping material;
    •   restore selected land surfaces to a "natural" condition including pathways and tracks. Limited 
        surface rehabilitation shall be carried out as fluctuating water levels, wave action, ice thrusting 
        and thaw will result in significant amounts of natural disturbance and resorting;
    •   install benchmark pins for future site identification;
    •   complete removal of soil in areas of any significant contamination identified in 1993/94;
    •   carry out further sampling of soils at Vanda Station;

Four buildings are known to contain asbestos linings and will be treated in accordance with NZAP 
policies (Appendix VI) which detail actions required when dealing with asbestos materials.

Step 7
Carry out analysis of soil samples from comprehensive site survey and carry out appropriate remedial 
action as required.

Step 8
All materials to leave Vanda will be flown by helicopter to Scott Base or stored and secured from the 
wind in a small area at Marble Point (20 minutes flying time). The site at Marble Point is in a location 
previously impacted by many years of cargo movement and refuelling activity.

Step 9
Materials stored at Marble Point will be returned to Scott Base by air or ship or by sledge (in 
October/November of the following season). Reusable fittings will be stored at Scott Base.

Removal activities will have the minor and transitory impacts of generating dust and noise. All solid and 
liquid wastes generated during this period will be removed under current NZAP Waste Management 
Policies and Procedures(Appendix VI).

Contaminated soil will be removed to Marble Point then disposed of at Scott Base. The level of 
contamination in the soil removed from Vanda can be expected to be no greater and could certainly 
be less that levels already found in soils at Scott Base. The basis for this assumption lies in the fact 
that Vanda Station is a considerably smaller station with Scott Base having operated year round since 
1957. Vanda operates as a summer only station (with the exception of three winters) with 2-3 support 
staff and has provided, in proportion, a fraction of the support to science events compared to Scott 
Base with over 30 summer support and 10 winter staff. In addition Scott Base has operated and 
continues to operate a number of vehicles that are likely to contribute to the contaminant load in the 
soils around the Base. Consequently the disposal at Scott Base of contaminated soils from Vanda 
Station is unlikely to have any significant impact on the environment around Scott Base compared to 
the current impact.

Some grey water contaminated soil water has already been successfully evaporated at Vanda Station. 
All grey water subsequently removed from soil at Vanda Station will be evaporated and residues 
returned to Scott Base for incineration.

              laboratory, store, emergency refuge and toilet). Located in the immediate area are
              also the meteorological enclosure, four helicopter pads and a small tower for a wind
              generator.

7       IMPLICATIONS OF A DECISION TO REMOVE VANDA STATION

The decision to remove Vanda Station from its current site in association with mitigation and remedial 
measures will ensure that NZAP's commitment to the Vanda environment is fulfilled. All physical 
structures will be removed as far as practicable. All contaminated soil with the potential to adversely 
impact on lake waters will be removed. In addition, a monitoring programme will ensure that any 
changes in lake waters can be quickly identified.

Relocation of any buildings to a site at Lake Vanda will be subject to a separate environmental 
evaluation. Any future activity at Lake Vanda will be of a much reduced scale than at the original 
station site and will be appropriate to the anticiapted level of science activity in the area. Procedures 
for waste management and fuel handling will be rigorous. It can also be assumed that the reduced 
size of any facility will require scaled down operational support including helicopter movements.

8       INFORMATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

The following investigations have been carried out to determine the extent of possible soil 
contaminants at and adjacent to Vanda Station.

Initial survey:
A survey was conducted by NZAP of all past Leaders of Vanda Station to acquire information 
concerning:
      •   the location of disposal sites and spills
      •   the nature of the materials disposed of at these sites, eg chemicals and fluids
      •   the amounts of materials disposed of; and
      •   the year of disposal.

The response to the request for information was good with 17 replies being received from managers 
for the 25 years of the Station's operation. Results of the survey are set out in Appendix VII and 
provide an indication of the nature of the contaminants that might be expected.

No major contamination of the Vanda Station site has been reported. Petrol and oil spills were 
generally only of a few litres or occasional drips from machinery; DFA leakages were dominantly from 
fuel transfers involving only a few litres, but occasionally leakages from stored drums occurred. 
Leakage of helo oil at helo pads was reported only once but is likely to have occurred more frequently.

The largest volume of contaminant derived was from domestic waste water. Estimates of the maximum 
amounts vary between 30 and 80 litres per day for an average of 80 days per year. During the years 
that the Station was occupied in winter, the annual amounts disposed of would have been much 
greater. All solid toilet wastes were removed, but occasional spillages during transfer were reported. 
After 1970 all liquid toilet wastes were removed but some ongoing urine contamination is likely to have 
occurred. Contamination from other sources (for example chemicals, batteries and explosives) are all 
likely to have been small and limited to occasional activities, apart that is from the disposal of darkroom 
chemicals which appear to have been disposed of with grey water.

Soil Contamination

A potentially significant environmental problem that is likely to be encountered in the removal of 
Vanda Station is soil contamination in the immediate environs of the Vanda Station buildings. Should 
any significant contamination be present in the soils, this could have an impact on the chemistry of the 
lake if chemical transfers from the soils into the rising lake waters were to occur.

In the first two years of operation of Vanda Station some dry wastes were open burnt in 44 gallon 
drums and ashes removed. All liquid wastes were poured onto the ground adjacent to the Station at 
three known locations. These wastes included grey water, urine, used photo chemicals and some 
battery acid. Since 1970 all solid and liquid wastes except strained grey water has been removed from 
the Wright Valley. Strained grey water continued to be dumped onto the ground in one of two 
locations near the mess until 1992/93 season. Grey water is now either evaporated (residues 
removed) or removed from the Wright Valley.

16
A study of soil contamination at Vanda Station was carried out in the 1992/93 season by New Zealand 
scientists expert in the fields of soil science and geochemistry (Dr I Campbell, Land & Soil Consultancy 
Services; Dr D Sheppard, Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences). The study analysed up to 33 
samples collected from nine soil pits, two of which were regarded as baseline. Limited analysis of 
water found in some of the pits was also under taken. A number of soil depths were sampled for a 
variety of possible contaminants. The results of the study are presented in Appendix I and have been 
independently reviewed by Dr Clive Howard-Williams (NIWA Christchurch). A copy of the review report 
is contained in Appendix II.

The field investigations of the extent of soil contamination involved sampling of soils at the various 
localities identified in the Vanda Leaders survey where disposal or contamination was known or 
believed to have occurred. The soils have been sampled from soil sampling pits at increasing depths 
down to ice-cemented permafrost (approximately 60cm depth).

Recent work from Marble Point and Ross Island (Campbell, Claridge and Balks in prep.) has shown that 
metal from oxidising copper wire and lead batteries, as well as experimentally applied lithium chloride, 
has the capacity to leach through the soils over both short and longer periods of time. However the 
soil climatic regime at Vanda Station is probably appreciably more arid than the sites studied at Marble 
Point and Ross Island (Campbell & Claridge 1987) and leaching and transfer of contaminants in the 
soils at Vanda Station would be expected to be less than at coastal locations. Never the less, 
evidence for leaching of contaminants through the soils at Vanda Station has been looked for by 
sampling the soils at various distances and depths away from the contaminations sources. Reference 
samples for comparisons have been collected from remote uncontaminated areas.

Analyses of the samples has been carried out at the laboratories of the Institute of Geological & 
Nuclear Sciences. The analyses (Table 1) concentrated on a range of substances and chemicals likely 
to have been introduced from the various activities during the existence of the Station.

9    MONITORING

Following the decommissioning of Vanda Station, NZAP intends to maintain a programme of 
environmental monitoring on the site. The details of the programme have been developed taking into 
consideration the results from both the 1992/93 on-site inspection and the analysis of soil from 
contaminated sites. The flooding of the Vanda Station site provides useful opportunities for deriving 
valuable practical and scientific information and this should be taken advantage of through a 
systematic ongoing monitoring programme.

It is unlikely that all contaminating substances in the soils of the Vanda Station environs will be 
successfully removed. One practical problem, for example, is that much of the terrain comprises 
shattered bedrock at shallow depth and should any contaminating substances have found their way 
into the bedrock, removal would be largely impractical.

It is important that, as the lake waters rise over the next few years (as expected) and gradually cover 
the site, detailed monitoring of the shallow waters around the site be continued. It is not known, for 
example, if or at what rate any contaminants remaining in the soil may permeate into the lake waters, 
although this would be expected to occur with a fluctuating water level.

17
It is proposed that one flooded water sample be collected from above sites VI, V16, V30 and from the lake edge at three locations well removed from the site. Trace elements, nutrients and plankton species will be analysed over three succeeding summers. At this stage a decision on whether to continue monitoring will be made. Should any benthic algal mats develop at the site during the second and third summers, these will also be sample and analysed for trace elements, biomass and species composition. Three samples will be taken from the site, compared with three samples collected away from the site.

Given the vagaries of climate it is not impossible that the rise in lake level might be reversed in the foreseeable future and the site re-exposed by a falling lake level. Should this occur, it is likely that there would be scientific interest in studying the site.  It is intended that a set of stainless steel benchmark pins be installed prior to station removal to facilitate future site identification.

10    REVISION

NZAP will annually review its involvement and activities at Vanda Station and will report to the RDRC.
The next review is scheduled for October 1994.

11   CONCLUSION

This IEE outlines a process by which NZAP will decommission Vanda Station. While some initial decommissioning work was carried out in the 1993/94 summer season the majority of work will take place in 1994/95. (see Appendix III and IV).

Provided all buildings and other structures are removed to the maximum extent practicable, and proposed site clean up measures are implemented, the major potential impact on the Lake Vanda environment from decommissioning is through possible contamination from old waste disposal and other similar sites such as the helicopter pads.

A programme has been formulated and partly implemented for the removal of soil and grey water from significantly contaminated sites. The programme is based on the results from soil sampling and consultation with scientists at NIWA. A monitoring programme has also been developed which concentrates on recording and assessing any changes in the waters of Lake Vanda should the old station site be inundated. Taken together these measures ensure that the impacts of decommissiong activities at Vanda Station are minor. In addition the need for continued science support at Lake Vanda has been recognised through retaining the option of relocating either exisitng Vanda buildings or relocatable huts to a new site in the area.  Such an activity will be subject to a separate environmental evaluation.

Consequently a CEE is not required.

IGNS Sample No: V1                                  Site No: 673

Reason Sampled: Assessment of environmental impacts from past human activities at Vanda Station; 
determination of nature of contaminants and the depth of contamination

Date Recorded: 23/12/92      Photo Record: CS Pro and site         Authors: IBC, GGC

Map Ref (Lat/Long): 75° 50'S, 166° 45'E

Locality: Vanda Station, Wright Valley at eastern end of Lake Vanda

Site Description: On lower slope of a shallow elongated gully, 60m ESE of the main Vanda Station 
building; the site is 8.5m below and down slope from a greywater disposal point and 0.5m above the 
lowest point of the gully

Altitude (m): 93         Aspect: ESE                        Slope: 4°

Geological Setting: The rocks of the area are granodiorites that have been cut with lamprophyre 
dykes and form a strongly undulating ridge and gully topography as a result of ice over riding from 
down-valley and up-valley glaciations and to a lesser extent, subaerial weathering; cryogenic 
weathering, probably assisted by repeated past rises and falls of waters in Lake Vanda, has generally 
given rise to a heavily fractured upper bedrock surface with common angular platy boulders; sands, 
derived partly from sorted lake sediments and also from aerial erosion fill most of the rock fracture 
interstices

Soil Parent Material: Fragmented granodiorite bedrock with a fine fraction of dominantly 
aeolian/fluvially sorted sandy material; in part contaminated by anthropogenic action (greywater 
discharges)

Estimated MAT (°C): -20     Soil Temp (°C):                Soil Climate Zone: Central Mountain

Soil Moisture Status: Xerous; the soil surface very occasionally moistened by summer snowfall; the 
site has received some runoff in the past from discharge of Vanda Station greywaters

Biological Activity: Nil         Patterned Ground: Nil

Surface Weathering/Features:

Previous Disturbance: A lower slope at a site of disposal of domestic waste waters

Sample Availability: Yes

Soil Profile Description:

673a  0-3cm; dark greyish brown (10YR 4/2) organic stained sandy pebble gravel; moderately 
cohesive with a distinct surface crust; distinct boundary

673b  3-10cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy pebbly gravel formed from in situ crumbled 
granodiorite bedrock; moderately cohesive; indistinct boundary

673c  10-25cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) pebble gravel formed from disaggregating bedrock; distinct 
boundary

673d  25-50cm; firm partly fractured bedrock with pale brown (5Y 6/3) loose sand infilling between 
fragmented bouldery clasts

Soil Weathering Stage: 1                            Frozen Ground Depth (cm): ~35cm

Frozen Ground Type: Dry frozen

Locality: Vanda Station, Wright Valley at the eastern end of Lake Vanda

Site Description:  On the floor of a shallow elongated gully, 40m SE of the main Vanda Station 
building; the site is in a shallow depression on the gully floor and close to the toe of a second 
greywater disposal site
Altitude (m): 91                                 Aspect:                                      Slope: Flat

Geological Setting: The rocks of the area are granodiorites that have been cut with lamprophyre 
dykes and form a strongly undulating ridge and gully topography as a result of ice over riding from 
down-valley and up-valley glaciations and to a lesser extent, subaerial weathering; cryogenic 
weathering, probably assisted by repeated past rises and falls of waters in Lake Vanda, has generally 
given rise to a heavily fractured upper bedrock surface with common angular platy boulders; sands, 
derived partly from sorted lake sediments and also from aerial erosion fill most of the rock fracture 
interstices

Soil Parent Material: Wind sorted granular sand largely derived from disaggregating granodiorite

Estimated MAT (°C): -20     Soil Temp (°C):           Soil Climate Zone: Central Mountain

Soil Moisture Status: Xerous; the soil surface very occasionally moistened by summer snowfall; 
lower horizons are wet probably as a result of inflow of water from rising Lake Vanda

Biological Activity:  Nil                                  Patterned Ground: Nil

Surface Weathering/Features:

Previous Disturbance: A lower slope at a site of disposal of domestic waste waters; a previous 
camping site with a nearby accumulation of old camp refuse

Introduction

As part of the review of the Draft Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) for the Decommissioning of Vanda Station I examined the data presented in the NZAP commissioned report: "Sheppard, D.S., Campbell, I.B. and Claridge, G.G.C. 1993. Contamination in the soils at Vanda Station: Priority samples. NZAP Report, Christchurch. 12 p plus appendices."

My aim was to determine the possible impact on Lake Vanda should contaminated soils from the base become flooded by rising lake levels. The background leading to the Sheppard et al. report is discussed in the Draft IEE produced by the New Zealand Antarctic Programme, and will not be discussed here.

Methods

Sheppard et al. 1993 identify several contaminated areas and have calculated a soil volume for the largest and most heavily contaminated of these, termed Greywater Gully. My approach to the possible impact of flooding of this area has been to take a worst case scenario of the whole area being flooded and leaching into the lake in a single year and to compare this with the natural addition of elements to the lake each year via the Onyx River, and other possible sources.

Contaminant inputs (potential)

Contaminant concentrations are those higher than a background value determined from sites away from Vanda Station, and are calculated by subtracting the mean background soil concentrations from the concentrations at the contaminated sites.

Contaminant concentrations (mg kg-1 of soil) are multiplied by a bulk density (say 1.5 kg dm3) and the soil volume of the whole contaminated area at Greywater Gully (42 x 103 dm3) to give the total mass of contaminant that is available for leaching.

It should be noted that Sheppard et al. 1993 analysed only the small size (<2.0 mm) fraction of the soils. The soils were frequently described as gravelly sands, bouldery sands, pebbly sands, etc. Thus the calculation of contaminant mass will be an over-estimation because the larger (>2.0 mm) fractions (pebbles, gravels, rocks) will have lower concentrations of contaminants than the fine fractions.

The calculation assumes that all contaminants will be leached in a single year, a further over-estimation.

Natural inputs

Natural inputs of elements to Lake Vanda occur by precipitation (snow), wind blown dust, Onyx River flows and deep groundwater flows.
2

For the purpose of these calculations, precipitation and wind blown dust are considered negligible, although it is clear that some input from these sources occurs (Masuda et al. 1982).

Deep groundwater inputs to Lake Vanda are discussed in Green and Canfield (1984) and Masuda et al. (1992).

The lower layers of Lake Vanda are made up of highly saline layers which originate from a historical sea water source combined with brine inflows from deep groundwater sources. These are highly enriched with certain elements (e.g. Ca, Cl_(2)), and concentrations of heavy metals also increase dramatically in the lower layers of the lake (e.g. at 60 m depth N_(i) = 189 mg m^(-3) and Cu = 900 mg m^(3), Masuda et al. 1982), compared with 0.25 and 0.46 mg m^(-3) of these elements in the Onyx River (Table 1).

The composition of the upper waters of Lake Vanda are a result of ionic diffusion from the brines coupled with the inflows from the Onyx River (Green and Canfield 1984). However, it should be noted that biologically active elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorus are also modified in the lake by intense microbial activity at the interface between the deep saline anoxic layers and the upper water column (Green et al. 1980; Vincent 1988). In addition, thick mats of cyanobacteria coat the bottom of the lake at least to 35 m depth (Dr R J Wharton, USARP pers. comm.). These help maintain a high level of oxygen in the sediments beneath them and may sequester and immobilise phosphorus.

The calculation of natural inputs is based on the following data:

The mean annual flow from the Onyx River to Lake Vanda for the period 1967 to 1981 was 2.5 x 10^(6) m^(3) (Chinn 1993).

The mean annual flow for the period 1981-1989 was _5.5 x 10^(6) m^(3)_ (Chinn 1993).

Lake level rise 1981-1990 = 7.0 m.

Ablation rate = 0.305 m yr^(-1).

Lake area in 1979 = 5.2 km^(2) (Vincent 1988)

Lake area in 1989 = 6.7 km^(2) (Chinn 1993)

By multiplying the mean concentrations of elements in the Onyx River water by the mean flow, the mass of elements entering the lake can be calculated. This is done for the periods 1967-1981 and 1981-1989.

The concentrations of elements in the Onyx River vary considerably with flow rate in any one season (Howard-Williams et al. 1986).

Early flows generally have a high nutrient content relative to flows later in the season, and each day there is a change in concentration as the river undergoes a diurnal freeze pattern. Salts are concentrated at the low flows. The data on natural concentrations vary from
3

intensive whole season samples to occasional spot samples. For this reason, averages were 
calculated whenever possible.

In addition, there is a downstream gradient in several chemical constituents, with biologically 
active elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus removed by microbial communities in the 
river. Data for the bottom end of the river are used wherever possible.

Comparisons

Table 1 shows the natural concentrations and annual loads from the Onyx River at the two 
inflow volumes, 2.5 x 10^6 m^3 (period 1969-1980) and 5.5 x 10^6 x m^3 (1981-1990). The 
relative importance of the contaminated soils at Vanda Station can be derived by expressing 
the mass of contaminant (Table 2) as a percentage of the total annual load from the river. 
The data are shown in Table 3. The contribution of all elements to the natural annual load, 
with the exception of total phosphorus, copper and lead will be negligible.

Dissolved phosphorus as PO4-P will add only an extra 10%. total phosphorus as a 
contaminant is a high (93%) proportion of the Onyx River flow for Total P. Although 
relatively high concentrations of phosphorus occur in the deep layers of Lake Vanda, only 
a small proportion diffuses upwards in any given year (Canfield and Green 1985). The 
upward diffusion is equivalent to 20% of the annual Onyx River input. Most of this is 
assimilated by a deep layer of planktonic cyanobacteria (Vincent 1988).

As the upper waters of Lake Vanda are a phosphorus limited ecosystem, it is necessary to 
examine this potential contaminant further. The "Total P" analysed was by Sheppard et al. 
1993 (see data in Tables 2 and 3) was the fraction extracted by 0.5 M sulphuric acid and is 
probably comprised of components of the rocks and soil grains themselves as well as any 
polyphosphates from the detergents in the waste greywater. It is not likely to be mobile and 
very little is likely to leach into the lake.

If all the copper and lead in greywater gully leached out in one year they would add 31 and 
18% respectively to the annual Onyx River load (Table 3). Note that the coefficient of 
variation of Onyx River flow over the decade 1978-1988 was 47%. It should also be noted 
that the values for copper and lead are over-estimates because:

1.    Only the fine fraction of the soils (certainly the richest in metals) was analysed but 
this value was multiplied by the entire mass of Greywater Gully soil. (Note at site 
V1 only 50% of the soil was fine fraction.)

2.    The chelation method used for metal extraction (DTPA) probably complexes more of 
the metal than would naturally leach in an aqueous environment.

The natural contribution in Table 3 does not include any elements leached from the soils all 
around the lake which are inundated when the lake rises each year.
4

The natural soils all around the lake which would be inundated by a lake level rise of 0.7 m, 
cover an area of approximately 0.1 km2. This is 425 times the area of Greywater Gully.

Therefore, contaminant P, Cu and Pb are likely to provide a very small additional input to 
the lake. Is this significant? Green et al. (1986) postulated that the extensive benthic algal 
mats in Lake Vanda (ca. 3 m2 in area) could serve as affective traps for dissolved metals 
being circulated across their surfaces. This would certainly be the case for any dissolved 
inorganic phosphorous. In addition, the high O2 and pH in the vicinity of the mats could 
promote deposition of Fe and Mn oxides and consequent sequestration of other metals by 
sorption. The mats could provide a major sink for metals. The evidence indicates that any 
increase in P, Cu or Pb from Greywater Gully would have a negligible effect on thee Lake 
Vanda ecosystem.

Other considerations

Heavy metals and nutrient elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus are natural compounds 
in Lake Vanda.  However, there are organic compounds associated with human 
contamination which are not naturally present in the lake, such as condensed poly-
phosphates, oil residues, soot, animal fats and oils, etc. Although the added organic carbon 
load from grey water gully is less than 2% of the annual load for the Onyx River (Table 3) 
the forms of the carbon are not natural to the area. For this reason it is advisable to remove 
the most heavily impacted soils - those where visible surface deposits are present.

These particularly relate to the area from site V1-V3 the grey water "slope" and site V25 
where condensed generator extract has discoloured the soil.

These soils should be removed from the site and returned to Scott Base.

In addition, the discoloured seepage water found in soil pits at site V1 in 1992/93 should be 
removed. This can be done in mid-January at maximum melt by pumping this water into 
drums for return to Scott Base. Alternatively it could be re-distributed on to evaporation 
trays, and the residual solids returned to Scott Base for incineration.

APPENDIX V      ASBESTOS - POLICY

Date:    September  1993
Review:  March  1994

Asbestos was commonly used as a lining material within buildings and as an 
insulation medium around pipes and containers.

All asbestos, whether it is white, brown or blue, is now considered as a health 
hazard, however, if the asbestos is NOT flakey or interfered with or disturbed in any 
manner, it constitutes little hazard.

There are several buildings under the control of NZAP, which are known to contain 
asbestos. These buildings are generally the older buildings such as:

1    The historic huts.
2    Vanda Station.
3    Original Scott Base buildings A and B Huts.

There may also be other buildings containing asbestos.

Work in the Ross Dependency does not legally require compliance with occupational 
safety and health regulations, however NZAP will make the best possible endeavours 
to ensure that as close as practical, persons working with asbestos are able to 
comply with the regulations.

The Facilities Section will make every endeavour to inform persons carrying out 
work in areas known to contain asbestos before such work commences.

They will also advise on the methods to be taken to handle any such occurrences and 
ensure relevant literature dealing with asbestos handling is provided.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN IF ASBESTOS IS FOUND:

1    Should asbestos be found during any works in an area which must be disturbed 
     to carry out that work, WORK IS TO CEASE.

2    The Facilities Section is to be informed via the SENZREP of any such 
     discoveries.
ACTION TO BE TAKEN WHEN WORKING WITH ASBESTOS:

Should it be considered imperative to work with asbestos without contacting
Facilities Section, the following minimum precautions are to be taken.

1    Read the occupational or safety publications (e.g. Asbestos Guide, Safety in
     Construction No. 22, 1986) dealing with working with asbestos.

2    Minimum dress shall be:
     a    Disposable overalls with head protection.
     b    Gloves, close fitting to overall arms.
     c    Breathing apparatus.
     d    Minimum clothing under the overalls.
     The overalls/gloves are to be kept isolated from other garments. At the end of
     the working day all overalls and protective equipment is to be sponged down
     close to the work place.

3    The following procedures are to be adopted in the working area:
     a    The area shall be ventilated to the maximum extent possible, at the
          same time ensuring that there is no cross contamination to other areas.
     b    If practical and possible, the areas affected should be dampened with
          water to ensure minimum dust flow.
     c    During the day and specifically at the end of the project, all surfaces
          are to be vacuum cleaned and NOT brushed.
     d    - Any wastes obtained are to be placed in heavy duty plastic bags
             for RTNZ and clearly marked asbestos.
          - Any wastes which are too large for bagging are to be carefully
             wrapped in plastic sheeting and sealed. It is preferable that
             protective crates are formed to ensure the bags or sheets are not
             perforated in any manner.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

1    The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for ensuring the workplace
     conditions for dealing with asbestos are met -
     a    By liaising with Facilities Section.
     b    By ensuring that all staff abide by any directions given.

2    The Supply Officer (winter) or Cargo Handler (summer) is responsible for
     a    Ensuring that all asbestos cargo is clearly identified and packaged.
     b    Ensuring that consignment notes clearly indicate asbestos is to be
          shipped.
     c    Ensuring that the Movements Controller, NZAP Headquarters, is fully
          aware that there is asbestos to be moved to New Zealand and disposed
          of, and how it is to be sent and the relative consignment numbers.
APPENDIX  VI     NZAP WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES

Date:     September  1993
Review:   March 1994

Introduction

The Antarctic Treaty provides safeguards for the protection of the Antarctic environment.

Recommendation XV-3 specifically sets out agreed practices regarding waste management planning and waste disposal as well as procedures to be followed in the implementation of the Recommendation. Annex III to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty provides additional measures for protection of the Antarctic environment which will become legally binding on all members of the New Zealand Antarctic Programme with the impending legislation and ratification of the Protocol.

Waste Management Planning

A staff member from NZAPHQ is designated as the Programmes Waste Management Officer whose role is to develop, implement and monitor a waste management plan.

All personnel involved in Antarctica with NZAP  are to be given training in environmental and waste management procedures.

Planning should ensure that -
a     unnecessary packaging is not sent to Antarctica;
b     polyurethane foam, polystyrene foam and beads are not used for packaging;
and
c     the use of poly-vinyl chloride (pvc) is discouraged.

Waste Management Procedures

All wastes are classified in accordance with Protocol requirements as follows:
a     sewage and domestic liquid wastes (Group 1);
b     other liquid wastes and chemicals, including fuels and lubricants (Group 2);
c     solids to be combusted (Group 3);
d     other solid wastes (Group 4); and
e     radioactive material (Group 5).

For ease of handling these are separated into two categories:

Burnable                                  Non-Burnable
Paper products                            All other plastic products
Food wastes                               Dry cell batteries
Untreated Timbers                         Treated Timer
Low density plastic                       Metal products
Rubbish bags

Disposal of Burnables:

All burnable wastes are to be burnt in the Scott Base high temperature incinerator and the ashes drummed and returned to New Zealand.

Disposal of Non Burnables:

All wastes designated as non-burnable, including hazardous wastes, are to be returned to New Zealand by ship or aircraft.
Disposal of Domestic Liquids:

Sewage, domestic liquid waste and final rinse photographic water generated at Scott Base are to be macerated and piped into the sea.

Disposal of Field Waste:

All solid wastes and to the maximum extent practicable, all liquid wastes generated in the field, are with the following exceptions to be returned to Scott Base to be integrated into the station's waste management plan.

a	For field parties working on or adjacent to sea ice, grey water, solid human waste and liquids are to be disposed of into the sea.

b	When operating from deep field campsites where transport limitations prevent the practical implementation of this policy, grey water, solid human waste and liquids may be buried in snow-covered glaciers.

c	At Cape Bird Hut liquids are piped from the hut site into the sea.

Waste Disposal Operation

1	Base Wastes

On the foreshore in front of Scott Base is a line of containers, one of which is designated for the storage of non-burnable waste products for return to New Zealand. This is the central storage area for non-burnable wastes and contains a group of drums, cages or receptacles for this purpose.

The Supply Officer is the person responsible for retrograding waste material to New Zealand and is responsible for organising the packing of the Waste Products Container.

Methods

a	Inside the Base:

Waste bins for each category are clearly labelled and located in all public areas inside the base.

In the public area adjacent to the shop the waste bins are labelled more specifically to enable visitors to be able to follow the correct procedures.

All aluminium beer cans are to be crushed using the can crusher in the bar and placed in the bin provided.

Cans containing food residue must be thoroughly washed out before return to New Zealand due to MAF Qual's Health Regulations.

Fruit juice cans (steel) are to be placed in the rubbish tin provided to avoid being mixed with aluminium beer cans.

b	Outside the Base:

At specified points outside the Base there are receptacles for the temporary storage of waste material. Once full they are to be taken to either the incinerator or the Waste Products Container. These points are as follows:

	i	Outside the Pantry:

	Metal waste container for crushed beer cans.

	ii	By the pantry area of the Mess:

	-	Wire cage for burnables.

	-	Receptacle for bottles (clear and coloured).

	-	Receptacle for tin cans (washed and squashed).
iii   Outside the Carpenter's Shop:
      - Metal waste container for non-burnable timber and bulk 
        storage of scrap metal.

iv    In the garage cold porch:
      - Metal waste container for waste metal products.

v     Outside the garage double doors:
      - Conex box containing drums for hazardous liquid wastes, fuels 
        and oils.

vi    Inside the Hangar:
      - Drum and bins for metal objects and burnables.

vii   Inside the garage:
      - Drum for scrap metal from within the workshops.

viii  Adjacent to helo pad:
      - Metal waste containers for burnable and non burnable wastes 
        returned from the field.

The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for having the above 
receptacles moved to the incinerator or to the Waste Products Container as 
appropriate. In all other work areas it is the responsibility of the work staff 
themselves to empty any waste containers using the above guidelines. It is 
important to use the correct rubbish receptacle when depositing any waste. 
Any problems should be directed to the Engineering Services Manager.

c     Liquids and Sewage:
      Domestic waste water         >     Flushed down the sink
      Final rinse photographic water >     Flushed down the sink

      Solid human waste and liquids are macerated, combined with the above, and 
piped into the sea.

      Any grey water or liquid human waste returned from any field station or 
camp is to be emptied into the sea.

d     Chemicals:
      Used photographic chemicals are stored in receptacles in the Laboratory. 
When these are full they are to be taken to the Supply Officer to put in the 
Waste Products Container.

      All other chemicals designated for return to NZ should be packaged in the 
appropriate container they were originally despatched in and handed to the 
Supply Officer.

2     Packing for Return to New Zealand

      Lead acid batteries are to be packed in the battery dispatch box before being placed in 
the Waste Products Container. The Engineering Services Manager, in liaison with 
the Supply Officer, is responsible for storage and packaging. 
All rubbish bags must be put inside a hessian bag to prevent spillage.

      All hazardous liquid wastes and incinerator ash must be packed inside a overpack 
drum.
Radio-active isotopes or materials must be stored in the appropriate container they were originally despatched in and handed to the Supply Officer.

3    Field Activities

A Waste Management Officer, whose responsibility is to ensure that the NZAP Waste Management Procedures are carried out, will be appointed from one of the event members for every event that leaves Scott Base.

All wastes are to be returned to Scott Base for disposal using double rubbish bags, blue for burnables and green for non-burnables.

Burnables                                  Non-Burnables
Paper wastes and products                 Plastics
Food scraps                                Dry cell batteries
Food packaging                            Glass items (wrapped)
Flattened empty food cans                 

a    Liquid Wastes and Sewage:
     At Bratina Island and Vanda Station all wastes, including liquids and 
     sewage, are to be returned to Scott Base.

     At Cape Royds, Cape Evans, Cape Roberts and other sites on or adjacent 
     to sea ice, all liquids and solid human wastes are to be disposed of 
     directly into the sea.

     In areas away from any melt water systems, a "P" area should be set-
     up, enabling only the minimum quantity of liquids to be returned to 
     Scott Base. Grey water should be emptied in this area and strained 
     through a sieve (one is provided in the kitchen box).

     If camped in snow/ice free areas or on the edge of lakes or ponds or 
     where there is free flowing surface water, then all liquids, including 
     urine, must be returned to Scott Base in 12 gallon drums. A funnel is 
     required to prevent spillage when pouring into drums.

b    Field Toilets:
     Toilet kits, comprising drum and lid, with a hessian sack as a liner 
     and two heavy weight bags inside, plus spares, are available for field 
     parties. Toilet wastes must only be returned to Base in a lidded drum.

c    Returning to Base:
     Upon return to Scott Base, field personnel should put the burnable and 
     non-burnable wastes into the respective waste master containers 
     situated near the helo pad. Solid human waste bags should be left 
     outside the incinerator.

APPENDIX X   COMMENTS RECEIVED ON DRAFT IEE
Comments on the draft IEE have been received from the New Zealand Committee of 
IUCN members, Greenpeace, Ministry for the Environment and J R Keys.

The main points raised in the response have been summarised below:

Process
    -   Lack of time to prepare comments on draft IEE.
    -   Lack of commitment to provide for effective public scrutiny
    -   Release of draft IEE after commencement of decommissioning work at Vanda 
        Station is not in accordance with protocol requirements.
    -   As the activity is already underway, this forecloses on the possibility of 
        conducting a CEE if such as assessment was to be indicated as necessary from 
        the IEE process.
    -   Draft IEE falls short of meeting the provisions of the protocol comments and 
        timetable.
    -   Any comments from interested parties should be included or acknowledged in 
        final IEE.

The Proposed Activity
    -   There is a lack of information regarding the actual removal of the station.
    -   More consideration needs to be given to the potential impacts over a wider 
        area where materials will be flown to or through ie. at Marble Point and 
        enroute to Scott Base.
    -   There appears to be no intention to remove contaminated soil at Vanda. Such 
        soil should be removed.
    -   The possibility of removing contaminated soil from Vanda in 1994/95 should 
        be included in the planning steps in the IEE.
    -   Grey water contaminated soil should be returned to New Zealand.

Information
    -   The IEE indicated that certain information will be publicly released which has 
        not been forthcoming, such as results of site inspections and analysis of 
        contaminated sites.
    -   No consideration given to potential cumulative impacts arising from the 
        proposed activity.

Format and Style
    -   Draft IEE written in "curious style" and in places reads more like a planning 
        document for the IEE.

Science Activities at Vanda
    -   It is not clear whether there will be science activities at Vanda during 
        1994/95.
    -   Further assessment should be made of future science requirements at Lake 
        Vanda and their potential cumulative impacts.
    -   More thought needs to be given to the impacts on science activities with the 
        loss of the existing Vanda facility.

Reasons for Decommissioning
    -   Is decommissioning being prompted solely by rising lake levels or by science 
        needs in the future as well?

Monitoring
    -   The IEE should contain greater detail on any proposed "ongoing monitoring" 
        of the site.

CEE Requirements
    -   Agree that a CEE is not required.
