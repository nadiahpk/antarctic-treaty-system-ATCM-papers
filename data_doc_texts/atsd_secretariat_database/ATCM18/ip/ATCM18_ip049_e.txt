TOURISM AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES
IN THE ANTARCTIC AREA

(Submitted by Germany)
Information paper
Tourism and other non-governmental activities in the 
Antarctic Treaty Area (No. 13 of the preliminary agenda)
(submitted by Germany)

The Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI)
in Bremerhaven/Germany is in contact with the following German 
tour operators
- Transocean, Bremen (MS "Columbus Caravelle")
- Hanseatic Cruises, Hamburg (MS "Bremen" and MS "Hanseatic")
- Plantours, Hannover (MS "Vistamar")

which regularly offer touristic travels from Germany to 
Antarctica.

The AWI has developed application forms which contain details 
concerning cruises, ship technology and implementation as well as 
management of cruises. These forms have been used by tour 
operators since 1993 to register touristic trips which have to be 
communicated, via assistance of AWI, to the ATCPs in the 
framework of the Information Exchange of the Antarctic Treaty as 
well as to COMNAP.

The AWI has furthermore developed assessment forms for the 
environmental assessment of cruises. Theses forms have been used 
since 1993 for the cruises' environmental impact assessment by 
the Federal Office of Environment 
(Umweltbundesamt - 
UBA), Berlin.

The AWI communicates all relevant documents concerning Antarctica 
to the tour operators including the
- Antarctic Treaty
- Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty
- COMNAP Guidelines for visits to stations
- IAATO recommendations
  - Agreed Measures
- Protected Areas.

In October 1993, representatives of the German tour operators 
were invited to attend a seminar held in Bremerhaven to provide 
information on the requirements imposed by the Antarctic Treaty, 
the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, 
the IAATO Guidelines, the COMNAP guidelines for research 
activities carried out in Antarctica and  environmental 
protection in Antarctica in general. A representative of the 
German Foreign Office participated in the seminar and lectured 
about the obligations of tour operators arising from the Protocol 
on Environmental Protection and the future German implementation 
law to the Protocol. He        the tour operators

  - to join IAATO, as far as they are not already members,
  - to apply the regulations of the Protocol on a voluntary 
basis even before it enters into force.

Relevant recommendations concerning equipment as well as conduct 
were submitted. The seminar is planned to be repeated at regular 
intervals.

Two of the three      tour ope?ators   
(Transocean and Hanseatic Cruises)
are already IAATO members; Plantours intends to apply for 
membership within the next few months.
