Marion Island (46º52’S, 37º51’E), one of South Africa’s sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands in the Southern Ocean, supports a diverse and abundant seabird fauna.  It is thought that climate is influencing the seabirds there in two ways.

Firstly, there have been long-term decreases in the breeding populations of three seabirds at Marion Island: Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua, Eastern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes chrysocome filholi and Crozet Shag or Cormorant Phalacrocorax [atriceps] melanogenis (Fig. 1; Crawford et al. 2003b, 2003c, 2003d). All three species feed relatively close to the island and the most likely reason for the decreases is an altered availability of food resulting from climate change.  Sea surface temperature at Marion Island increased by 1.4ºC between 1949 and 1998 (Melice et al. in press).  Mean surface air temperature increased by 1.2ºC between 1949 and 1999 (Smith 2002).  That food is now limiting populations of these three seabirds is suggested by several factors.  During the period 1994/95-2002/03, reproductive success for all three species was inadequate to maintain their populations.  There was a low mass at fledging of Rockhopper Penguin chicks.  There was a decrease in the size of colonies of Crozet Shags, suggesting a decrease in the density of food near colonies.  There was also a change in the species composition of prey in the diet of Crozet Shags.  

Secondly, breeding by most seabirds at Marion Island was markedly different from usual during the 1997/98 season, coinciding with the major El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of the same period (Fig. 2; Crawford et al. 2003e).  There was poor breeding by seabirds foraging near to the island, whereas those able to forage far from the island, such as King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans, Grey-headed Albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma and two species of giant petrel Macronectes spp., bred well.  In the following breeding season (1998/99) weight on arrival at breeding colonies was considerably reduced for both Macaroni Penguin E. chrysolophus and Rockhopper Penguin, suggesting that the 1997/98 ENSO event may have influenced availability of food to these penguins in the period between the 1997/98 and 1998/99 breeding seasons (Fig. 3; Crawford et al. 2003a, 2003c).  Thus it appears that climate perturbations operating at a global scale may influence breeding by seabirds in the sub-Antarctic environment.

It is thought that altered climate, through reducing the availability of prey, has also led to decreases in populations of Rockhopper Penguins at Campbell Island to the south of New Zealand (Moors 1986, Cunningham & Moors 1994) and at Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean (Guinard et al. 1998).  Other studies in the Southern Ocean have suggested the possibility that ENSO events may affect the reproductive success or survival of seabirds, including at Adélie Land, Antarctica (Chastel et al. 1993) and South Georgia (Croxall et al. 1988).  

The susceptibility of seabirds in the Southern Ocean to climate change and variability may lead to long-term change in the structure of seabird communities there.  Of especial concern is that the conservation status of some species or isolated populations, such as the Crozet Shag at the Prince Edward Islands, may deteriorate as a result.  Additionally, climate warming may facilitate the introduction of disease or vectors of disease to seabird breeding localities in the Southern Ocean (e.g. Schultz & Petersen 2003), further threatening the seabirds of the region.
