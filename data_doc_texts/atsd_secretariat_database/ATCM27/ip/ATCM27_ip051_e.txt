ON THE NAMING OF THE UNNAMED GEOGRAPHIC ANTARCTIC FEATURES










 
Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring (Roshydromet) in accordance with the Federal law "On the names of geographic features " submitted to the Interdepartmental Commission on Geographic Names a proposal to name some unnamed geographic Antarctic features after the outstanding scientists contributed to the Antarctica exploration and investigation as follows: Nikolay A. Volkov, Pavel A. Gordienko, Pavel K. Senko, Mikhail E. Ostrekin, Vasily Sidorov.
The proposed unnamed geographic features situated in Wohlthat Massive, Dronning Maud Land,  were determined by the aerial phototopography survey in 1961. Topographic maps representing these geographic objects were compiled by the Institute "Soyuzmorniiproject" with the participation of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute using the data of 1960-1961 Soviet Antarctic Expedition.
The Interdepartmental Commission on Geographic Names at its 13-th session on 23 December 2003 approved the proposal of the Roshydromet to name the unnamed geographical Antarctic features after the outstanding scientists contributed to the Arctic and Antarctic exploration and investigation as follows:
