COMNAP Report to ATCM XXVII 





INTRODUCTION

    1. COMNAP was established in 1988.  It serves as a forum in which the directors and logistics managers of the National Antarctic Programs develop practices that improve the effectiveness of their activities pursuant to the Antarctic Treaty and the associated Environmental Protocol.  COMNAP includes a permanent Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations (SCALOP) and a number of task-oriented Working Groups and Networks.  Appendix 1 provides the current terms of reference and membership of COMNAP’s groups and networks.  

    2. As part of COMNAP’s responsibilities to the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), COMNAP also provides input to ATS discussions derived from its operational experience and carries out analyses in response to requests from the Treaty System.  


CURRENT AND RECENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO ATS WORK

    3. The COMNAP Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON) has developed a draft “Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programs”, for detailed discussion and adoption at the next COMNAP meeting.  The results of this important work will be provided to ATCM XXVIII.  Meanwhile, the draft guidelines can be found on the COMNAP web site at http://www.comnap.aq under the section “Environment”.  

    4. COMNAP participated in the March 2004 Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on “Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in Antarctica” and presented the results of a survey concerning National Program policies and interactions with tourist and NGO activity.  These data will be analysed further by the COMNAP Working Group on Tourism and NGOs (TANGO) at the next meeting and our conclusions presented at ATCM XXVIII.

    5. COMNAP has prepared the following papers for consideration at ATCM XXVII:
    • Working Paper ATCM XXVII / WP-009 on the Applicability to the Antarctic of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) “Guidelines for Ships operating in Arctic Ice-covered Waters”
    • Working Paper ATCM XXVII / WP-010 on Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica
    • Information Paper ATCM XXVII / IP-012 on COMNAP’s Framework and Guidelines for Emergency Response and Contingency Planning in Antarctica
    • Information Paper ATCM XXVII / IP-013 on Environmental Training in National Antarctic Programs: a Workshop between the COMNAP Networks AEON and TRAINET
    • Information Paper ATCM XXVII / IP-014 on the Interaction between National Antarctic Programs and Non-Government and Tourism Operations
    • Information Paper ATCM XXVII / IP-015 on an Analysis of Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs)

    6. As invited by Resolution 2 (2003) COMNAP, in liaison with SCAR, has engaged in preparations for the forthcoming International Polar Year (2007-2008).  


CONCLUSIONS from CURRENT ATS-RELATED TASKS


ATCM XXVII WP –009: Applicability to the Antarctic of the IMO “Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-covered Waters” 

    7. As requested by ATCM XXVI, COMNAP completed its ongoing work on the applicability to the Antarctic of the IMO “Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-Covered Waters.  COMNAP has relied on its operational expertise in complying with the ATCM request to advise on modifications that would render the IMO Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic ice-covered waters suitable for the Antarctic.  The final results of this work are presented to ATCM XXVII in Working Paper ATCM XXVII / WP-009 and appendices A and B.
        ◦ COMNAP and its Ship Operations Working Group (SHIPOPS) reaffirmed our earlier conclusions, presented in ATCM XXV / IP-040, that the IMO Arctic guidelines adequately address the shipping issues that should be addressed.  
        ◦ The Working Group confirmed that a double skin around tanks carrying pollutants as required in paragraph 3.3.1 of the guidelines would provide an adequate technical standard for operations in Antarctic waters.  
        ◦ The Working Group assessed that the general requirement (paragraph 3.3.2 of the Guidelines) for a full forepeak to after peak double bottom for all sizes and types of new research ships was a very stringent design requirement that should not be applied if the same standard of ship’s stability and safe floating can be ensured by other means.  
        ◦ COMNAP notes that it would not be the interests of international science to increase the costs of specialised research vessels unnecessarily and wishes to draw attention to the question of whether full double bottom construction is necessary for ships operating in Antarctic waters where the same standard of safe floating and stability can be achieved by other means.  


ATCM XXVII WP-010: Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica 

    8. In 2002 the United Kingdom presented to CEP V Working Paper ATCM XXV / WP-026 containing proposed guidelines for the operation of aircraft near concentrations of birds in Antarctica.  The Committee on Environmental Protection invited COMNAP to review the guidelines in consultation with SCAR and to report back to the CEP.  
        ◦ The proposed Guidelines were discussed initially at the COMNAP annual meeting in Brest where COMNAP tasked its Air Operations Working Group (AIROPS) and Environmental Coordinating Group (ECG) with collaborating on the subsequent in-depth review. Work focused on developing practical and easy-to-use guidelines that would help aircraft operations in Antarctica to be undertaken safely with the minimal environmental impact.  Pending further scientific evidence, these guidelines are considered to constitute a reasonable basis for voluntary implementation.  They are based on the practical experience of researchers, including input from SCAR, and on experience derived from the national operators’ provision of logistics support to researchers.  
        ◦ COMNAP recommends that aircraft operations in Antarctica should be planned and carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica presented in ATCM XXVII WP-010 to the maximum extent practicable.  


ATCM XXVII IP-012:  COMNAP’s Framework and Guidelines for Emergency Response and Contingency Planning in Antarctica 

    9. COMNAP’s Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations has been working for several years to develop a Framework and Guidelines for Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning.  The document presented in IP-012 was prepared under SCALOP direction and adopted by COMNAP this past year as a methodology that should assist national programs as they prepare guidelines adapted to their particular situations.  


ATCM XXVII IP-013:  Environmental Training in National Antarctic Programs 

    10. The COMNAP Antarctic Environmental Officers’ Network (AEON) and Training Officers’ Network (TRAINET) held a joint workshop in July 2003 on Environmental Education and Training in National Antarctic Programs.  The goal was to develop ways to incorporate the AEON findings into the national program’s training activities.  The workshop was productive and successful, producing a Voluntary Checklist for Environmental Training as well as a series of recommendations and considerations that will facilitate information exchange and development of environmental training.
        ◦ The workshop outcomes are presented to ATCM XXVII in Information Paper ATCM XXVII / IP-013 on environmental training in national Antarctic programs: a workshop between the COMNAP networks AEON and TRAINET.  


ATCM XXVII IP-014:  Interaction between National Antarctic Programs and Non-Government and Tourism Operations. 

    11. ATCM XXVI Decision 5 (2003) to convene and invite COMNAP to participate in the Meeting of Experts on Tourism led us to modify the scope of our annual survey in order to provide different information on the policies and experiences of National Antarctic Programs concerning tourism activities in Antarctica. The new survey covered the five-season period from 1998/1999 to 2002/2003 and the results are summarized in IP-014.
        ◦ While COMNAP and its Tourism Working Group have not had a chance to meet and analyse the results in full detail the survey once again shows that interactions  between the national operators and the portion of the tourist industry represented by IAATO function in a very satisfactory way.  This is largely because COMNAP and IAATO make a great deal of effort to coordinate and exchange information with each other as they prepare and plan for their Antarctic operations.  
        ◦ The survey results were compiled by the COMNAP Secretariat and discussed in detail with the Chair of the COMNAP Tourism Working Group (TANGO) and the COMNAP Chair-elect.  The COMNAP chair-elect presented the findings and represented COMNAP in the discussions at the Meeting of Experts in Norway.
        ◦ As noted in paragraph 4, the Tourism Working Group will analyse the survey information in detail at the COMNAP annual meeting in Bremen this summer.   

ATCM XXVII IP-015:  Analysis of Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs) 

    12. Following the discussion at ATCM XXV in Warsaw of COMNAP paper IP-026, which presented some results from its Antarctic Environmental Officers Network’s (AEON) analysis of a number of Initial Environmental Evaluations, the Committee on Environmental Protection requested “that a more detailed analysis be provided which clearly identified strengths and weaknesses and gaps in the past IEEs.”  AEON and the COMNAP Environmental Coordinating Group (ECG) have completed this additional task.
        ◦ Specific strengths, weaknesses and gaps requiring attention were identified in several areas.  These can be found in IP-015 and its Appendix.
        ◦ While The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica provide an excellent benchmark for best practice in Antarctic EIA, and authors should be further encouraged to consult them throughout the IEE process,  establishing a methodological approach to evaluation of environmental impacts remains a challenge. Further guidance with respect to appropriate methodologies and systematic approaches to impact evaluation would be valuable.  


Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programs 


    13. Environmental monitoring has been an important focus of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) work since the mid-1990s.  During the 1999 COMNAP meeting in Goa, India, the Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON) arranged a workshop that identified key steps in the process of developing, designing and implementing environmental monitoring programs, looked at areas where there may be gaps in the current documentation and information available to operators, and recommended that practical guidelines for developing and designing an environmental monitoring program be prepared. 

    14. This work, which has been advanced by AEON since then, should assist all national programs, including those with limited resources or who may not have a systematic monitoring programme in place, and will assist in minimizing human impacts on the Antarctic continent..  

    15. The draft “Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programs” will be tabled at COMNAP’s upcoming 2004 annual meeting for discussion and endorsement.  The results will be brought to ATCM XXVIII in 2005.  Meanwhile, the draft guidelines may be viewed on the COMNAP web site at http://www.comnap.aq under the section “Environment”.  


Preparation of the forthcoming International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008

    16. As invited by Resolution 2 (2003) COMNAP, in liaison with SCAR, has engaged in the preparation of the forthcoming International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008.  

    17. COMNAP officers have participated actively in planning discussions with the SCAR Executive Committee, members of the International Council of Science IPY Planning Group and with World Meteorological Organization (WMO) officials, as well as with officials of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Forum of Arctic Research Operators (FARO). The COMNAP focus up to now has been primarily to develop full awareness of planning efforts underway in the science community.  COMNAP and the national operators are poised to begin detailed preparations for IPY operations in support of consensus scientific goals as the latter become established this summer.

    18. COMNAP is planning focussed discussions at the upcoming joint meeting with SCAR in Bremen concerning ways the National Programs can work together to achieve the overarching goals now being established by the science planning groups.


OTHER COMNAP TASKS AND ACTIVITIES


COMNAP Meetings and Events 

    19. COMNAP’s 2003 annual meeting COMNAP XV was hosted by the French Polar Institute from 7 to 11 July 2003 in Brest, France.  In conjunction with the meeting were held (1) a two-day workshop on Environmental Education and Training in Environmental Management, (2) a one-day workshop on energy management and (3) a joint SCAR-COMNAP Executive meeting.  

    20. Preparations are well advanced for COMNAP’s 2004 annual meeting COMNAP XVI, to be hosted in conjunction with SCAR XXVIII by the Alfred Wegener Institute from 25 to 30 July 2004 in Bremen, Germany.  In conjunction with the meeting will be held (1) a half-day workshop on energy management, (2) a series of meetings to discuss preparations for the IPY, addressing both collaboration with SCAR and the IPY organising committee and collaboration between national programs to support IPY projects and (3) a joint SCAR-COMNAP Executive meeting.  

    21. COMNAP XVI will include a Symposium on Antarctic Logistics and Operations on the theme “towards the International Polar Year and beyond”.  The main topics to be addressed in the symposium are:
    • New transportation technologies and applications
    • Technology to enable science
    • Technology to reduce environmental impact
    • Ergonomic issues related to polar work
    • Latest developments in energy storage

    22. COMNAP unanimously accepted Bulgaria’s offer to host the 2005 COMNAP meeting.  COMNAP XVII will be held in Sofia from 12 to 15 July 2005.  


COMNAP Secretariat Operation 

    23. Jack Sayers, the COMNAP Executive Secretary for the past six years, announced his retirement shortly after the Shanghai COMNAP meeting.  Jack has long been a mainstay of COMNAP and he will be missed.

    24. COMNAP initiated an international search to identify a successor Executive Secretary and Secretariat host organization and.  Several outstanding proposals were received and reviewed.  The result was the selection of Dr. Antoine Guichard and the Office of Antarctic Affairs of the Tasmanian State Government.  

    25. COMNAP saluted Mr. Sayers years of outstanding service and welcomed Dr. Guichard to the COMNAP family at our annual meeting in Brest last summer.


COMNAP Brochure 

    26. A brochure outlining the goals, structure and activities of COMNAP has been produced in the four Antarctic Treaty languages and will be available for distribution to the delegates of ATCM XXVII / CEP VII.  The COMNAP secretariat is providing templates for the brochure to members wishing to prepare copies in additional languages; a version in Japanese has been prepared by Japan’s National Institute for Polar Research.  


Book on National Antarctic Programs 

    27. A book describing a number of organisations implementing their nation’s Antarctic programs was compiled in 2003 in conjunction with COMNAP XV with the support of the French National Program.  The book, in English, was published as a special volume of the journal “Accès International”.  


Joint SCAR-COMNAP Executives’ Meeting

    28. SCAR and COMNAP continue to hold regular meetings bringing together both organisations’ Executive committees to discuss and coordinate their activities.  Two such joint Executive meetings were held in the last year in conjunction with ATCM XXVI and COMNAP XV.  


Support of the Antarctic Master Directory

    29. COMNAP welcomed presentations on the goals and achievements of the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) project from SCAR and AMD representatives at its annual meeting in Brest and concluded that continued joint support of the project with SCAR is justified.  COMNAP indicated that it would welcome a detailed proposal from the AMD to this end.  Operation of the AMD has been overseen by the joint SCAR-COMNAP STeering Committee for Antarctic Data Management (STADM) under SCAR’s leadership.
