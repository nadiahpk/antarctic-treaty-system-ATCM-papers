INTERACTION BETWEEN NATIONAL ANTARCTIC PROGRAMS AND
NON-GOVERNMENT AND TOURISM OPERATIONS
























Information Paper on the Interaction between National Antarctic Programs and
Non-Government and tourism Operations





INTRODUCTION

    1. COMNAP submitted in 2002 to the Warsaw ATCM Information Paper ATCM XXV / IP-27 on The Interaction between National Operators, Tourists and Tourism Operators.  Because of the interest shown by delegates in the report, COMNAP decided to continue collecting data on such interactions through annual surveys and to provide updated reports to subsequent ATCMs.  COMNAP submitted a first update in 2003 to the Madrid ATCM in the form of a new Information Paper ATCM XXVI / IP-37.  

    2. ATCM XXVI decided in Decision 5 (2003) to convene before ATCM XXVII a Meeting of Experts (ATME) with the aim of discussing relevant matters related to tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica and invited COMNAP to participate to the meeting 

    3. In response to ATCM’s request, COMNAP decided to expand the scope and detail of its survey in order to provide the ATME with more comprehensive information on the National Antarctic Programs (NAPs) interactions with Non-Government Organisation (NGO) and Tourism Operations in Antarctica.  

    4. COMNAP repeats what was noted in ATCM XXV / IP-27 and in ATCM XXVI / IP-37, namely that some aspects of the tourist/science interface are not touched upon in this survey.  These include the presence of people in environmentally sensitive areas and the possible impact on research or the cumulative impacts of visits to specific sites.  Nor are the potential risks of accidents (such as oil spills) being assessed.  

    5. COMNAP notes again that contacts on the practical level, as demonstrated in the survey, between the national operators and the portion of the tourist industry represented by IAATO, function in a very satisfactory way.  This is largely because COMNAP and IAATO make a great deal of effort to coordinate and exchange information with each other as they prepare and plan for their Antarctic operations.  


TIME FRAME

    6. To provide the ATME and ATCM XXVII with data spreading over several seasons rather than just one, the new survey covered the last five seasons, 1998/1999 to 2002/2003 inclusive.  


SCOPE

    7. The survey covers all interactions that National Antarctic Programs had over five consecutive seasons with any non-government or tourism operation in the Treaty Area (South of 60°S).  The questionnaire was designed to capture a range of new information relevant to the specific topics to be discussed at the ATME, with information structured in seven sections as follows:
    1. Passive involvement with NGO/tourism operations
    2. Emergency Response Action and NGO/tourism operations
    3. Environmental Response Action and NGO/tourism operations
    4. National Authorisation Procedures
    5. Co-ordination
    6. Government support of private activities in Antarctica
    7. Benefits to national programmes from NGO/tourism operations
Copy of the questionnaire used for this new survey is provided in Appendix 1.  

    8. The present paper is intended to summarize the data captured through the survey, and not to draw conclusions from it.  COMNAP and its subcommittee on tourism will meet in late July and will then take up the question of interpretation.  Most response rates are given as percentages and are followed by the corresponding number of respondants in the sample.  For example, in a section relevant to only sixteen programmes, a response given by four programs will be noted as “25% (4/16)”.  

    9. The need to conduct the survey prior to the end of the austral operating season in order to prepare for the Meeting of Experts ruled out updating our previous data on the intensity of tourist visits to stations operated by national programs.  However, the data reported by COMNAP to ATCM XXVI in IP-37 provide a reasonable estimate of intensity for background and orientation purposes.  We therefore repeat here the observation made in that paper.  The number of visits at stations varied considerably.  Eight stations were visited only once while two stations had 20 visits or more during the season.  All visited stations outside the Peninsula area (with the exception of South Pole) had fewer than 5 visits. Around 138 station visits were made in total. The average was approximately 6.6 visits (cf. 7.3) per station.  In total some 6,900 tourists (cf. 9,300) have been reported to visit research stations in Antarctica during the 2002/03 season.  This gives an average of approximately 50 persons/visit (cf. 67), typically varying between 60 and 150 (cf. 30 and 100) (and a couple of exceptions with only 5-6 visitors).  However, the bimodal distribution of visits and visitors means that average numbers can be misleading.  Average visits to the six most visited stations were 19 with an average number of visitors for each visit at 49.  

    10. Continuing to repeat conclusions from IP-37, The statistics show a very clear pattern.  Approximately half of the visits were short and lasted typically 2 - 4 hours, with small variations, and approximately half the visits lasted up to 12 - 24 hours.  In one instance a visit lasted several days when weather conditions prevented their departure.  The group did, however, set up their own camp.


RESPONSE RATE

    11. Twenty-three of the 29 national operators responded to the survey, a response rate of 79%.  Although not all national programs could respond to the survey, the results and statistics presented here are deemed indicative of the general situation.  Note that not all members were in a position to answer all questions.  


PASSIVE INVOLVEMENT WITH NGO/TOURISM OPERATIONS

    12. 50% of the respondents (11/22) have written guidelines, policies or operating procedures governing their interactions with NGO/Tourism operations.  Some of the members without such written procedures noted that it was because they had had little if no interaction with NGO/tourism operations as yet.  

    13. 76% of the respondents operating stations (16/21) do allow NGOs/tourists to visit their stations.  75% of those allowing visits (12/16) have a combination of restrictions or limitations on such visits.  Of these 12 programmes imposing restrictions or limitations:
    • 67% (8/12) require no interference with program activities
    • 42% (5/12) restrict access to certain areas
    • 33% (4/12) impose a maximum number of ship visits per season and per station
    • 33% (4/12) allow guided visits only
    • 25% (3/12) impose a maximum number of visitors per season and per station
    • 25% (3/12) require advance notification of visits
    • 17% (2/12) require coordination of visit with station
    • 17% (2/12) impose a maximum number of visitors per visit
    • 17% (2/12) impose limits on environmental impact level
    • 8% (1/12) impose a limit on time spent on station
    • 8% (1/12) allow visits by IAATO members only
    • 8% (1/12) require the respect of a code of conduct
    • 8% (1/12) require assurance of the respect of Antarctic Treaty provisions
    • 8% (1/12) require adequate self-supporting arrangements
    • 8% (1/12) require insurance cover
    • 8% (1/12) require a promise to provide post-visit report

    14. 50% of those without restrictions or limitations (2/4) indicated that they may reconsider if visitation levels increased.  


EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTION AND NGO/TOURISM OPERATIONS

    15. 29% of respondents (6/21) had to provide emergency assistance to NGO/tourism operations.  


Types of incidents attended to

    16. Of the 6 programmes having provided emergency assistance:
    • 50% (3/6) attended visitors health problems
    • 34% (2/6) attended ship incidents
    • 17% (1/6) attended yacht incidents
    • 17% (1/6) attended aircraft incidents
    • 17% (1/6) attended land-based incidents


Types of assistance provided

    17. Of the 6 programmes having provided emergency assistance:
    • 83% (5/6) provided medical care
    • 50% (3/6) provided ship support
    • 34% (2/6) provided air support
    • 17% (1/6) provided mechanical assistance


Resources consumed

    18. 4 of the 6 programmes having provided emergency assistance were in a position to evaluate the total time and money they had devoted to this assistance.  This totalled for the 4 programmes:
    • 26 person-days 
(31% of this for extreme/adventure tourism)
    • USD 156,000
(2.3% of this for extreme/adventure tourism)


ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE ACTION AND NGO/TOURISM OPERATIONS

    19. 33% of respondents (7/21) do undertake routine monitoring to assess environmental effects of NGO/tourism operations.  Of these members, 71% (5/7) undertake monitoring on station and 43% (3/7) undertake monitoring at other visitor sites.  


NATIONAL AUTHORISATION PROCEDURES

    20. Two members remarked that they did not as yet have relevant national procedures in place although one was expecting the relevant law to be adopted in early 2004.  

    21. 67% of respondents (14/21) do not in their country have responsibility for undertaking compliance checks in Antarctica against authorizations issued by their government to NGO/tourism operations, and state that they are not always qualified to provide comments on national authorization procedures

    22. 15 members could provide details on types of checks included in their national procedures for authorization of NGO/tourism operations. This included checks on
    • Environmental impacts, by 100% of the 15 members
    • Safety, by 53% (8/15)
    • Self-sufficiency, by 40% (6/15)
    • Search and Rescue, by 33% (5/15)
    • Insurance cover, by 33% (5/15)

    23. Two members noted that the checks on aspects other than environmental impacts could only give rise to recommendations, as their national law did not regulate these aspects.  One member indicated that all its nationals’ activities in Antarctica would in future be regulated through their national law implementing the Madrid Protocol and that the Ministry of Environment, responsible for granting permits, may call on the national programme itself to comment on environmental impacts of the proposed activity.  One member indicated that his government was placing observers on tour vessels it had issued permits to, with the primary objective of ensuring compliance, and that the national programme assisted with the selection and training of the observers.  


CO-ORDINATION


Co-ordination between national programs

    24. 24% of respondents (5/21) indicated having formal systems in place, other than the COMNAP and ATS Exchange of Information processes, to provide to other national programmes advance notification of NGO/tourism operations.  Of these 5 members:  
    • 80% (4/5) use simple, bilateral notification procedures, advising other programmes of known operations that may affect them
    • 20% (1/5) publish all known information on their web site

    25. Two of the members with no other formal systems in place explicitly indicated using informal bilateral notification whenever possible.  


Co-ordination with NGO/tourism operators

    26. One member noted sending a representative to the annual IAATO meeting.  

    27. Before each summer:
    • IAATO provides COMNAP with information on its members’ operations, including schedules and vessel contact details
    • COMNAP provides IAATO with updated contact information for national programmes including vessels and stations

    28. On request:
    • COMNAP provides any private expedition with contact information for national programmes including vessels and stations
    • COMNAP provides any private expedition with copies of the Antarctic Flight Information Manual

SUPPORT PROVIDED VS BENEFITS RECEIVED

    54. There is no data available to provide a comparison in terms of value of the government support of private activities versus the benefits to national programmes from NGO/tourism operations, that is we are not in a position to assess whether or not the interaction brings a net benefit to national Antarctic programmes.  We can only report a comparison in terms of the number of national programmes involved in these interactions.  This is summarised in the table below.
