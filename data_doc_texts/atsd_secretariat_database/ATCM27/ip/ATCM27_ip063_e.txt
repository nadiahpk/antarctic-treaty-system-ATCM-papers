IAATO OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM 
2003-2004 ANTARCTIC SEASON

































IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism
2003-2004 Antarctic Season

Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) 


The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2003-2004 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. Additional information can be found on line at www.iaato.org, including the statistics compiled annually by the Office of Polar Programs at the United States National Science Foundation (US-NSF). The information is presented on the best available knowledge at the time this document is presented. 

1.0	Overview

1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As in all years past, IAATO activities outweighed non-IAATO Member activities overall. A summary of IAATO Member activities follows:

    • 517 passengers participated in land-based expeditions. 
    • 14,902 passengers traveled aboard vessels and landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area.
    • 489 passengers traveled aboard vessels and landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica.
    • 37 passengers participated in an air/cruise voyage to Antarctica departing from South America and landing at King George Island, embarked a vessel and sailed for six days.
    • 4,747 passengers traveled aboard large cruise vessels that were cruise-only (and did not land in Antarctica).
    • 679 passengers participated in over-flights from South America to Antarctica aboard aircraft.
    • All operators have submitted Initial Environmental Impact Assessments or Preliminary Assessments as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National authority.
    • Seven additional cruise vessels and two sailing vessels/yachts operated in 2003-2004 although three vessels had operated in past years. 

        1.2 Non-IAATO Operators’ Activities
    • Approximately 3,793 passengers traveled aboard two non-IAATO operated vessels or aircraft, landing passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Operators complied with their National legislation.
    • Approximately 185 passengers traveled on sailing vessels/yachts. Information pertaining to these vessels was not possible to obtain from either the vessel operators or National authorities.
    • One vessel carrying 202 passengers cruised but did not land passengers. No environmental impact assessment was required by the operator’s National authority.
    • More than 2,148 passengers have participated in overflights to Antarctica from either Australia or South Africa.
    • Government-supported tourism activities on ships and aircraft occurred, but information has not been provided to IAATO for activities departing from South Africa and South America.
    • Private and some commercial activities where Advance Notification and Post Visit Site Reports have been filed through their National authority have not been forwarded to IAATO for inclusion in this report. 
    • Information on four adventure flight-tourist activities conducted by Vacher, Murray, Johanson and McLeod are included as Appendix D. 
    • Countries that did not require Environmental Impact Assessments and/or Post Visit Site Reports from commercial tourist operations taking place in Antarctica, but permitted activities of non-IAATO operators, include Australia, France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. Despite repeated requests by IAATO to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCP’s) to compile all landing and/or cruise information in order to incorporate into the yearly statistics, the required Post Visit Site Reports were not forthcoming; therefore the numbers of passengers are noted as estimates or approximate where hard data was not available.

        1.3 Commercial Tourist Activities 
Commercial tourist activities included small boat or Zodiac cruising, shore landings, and to a lesser extent kayaking, mountain climbing, scuba diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, marathon running, helicopter and Argo operations. All of these activities have taken place for a minimum of five years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the 1960’s. A brief summary of the season, including an "IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2003-2004,” and “IAATO Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism, 2004-2005,” are appended as Appendix A and Appendix E, respectively, which provide further details of the operators, vessels and numbers.

Based on information returned to IAATO and US-NSF in annual reports or in the Post Visit Site Reports from the 2003-2004 season, it is estimated that at least 19,669 passengers landed in the Antarctic on private sector seaborne and land-based expeditions. 

Nearly all commercial tour companies during the 2003-2004 season were located in Contracting Party States.

    2.0 Commercial Seaborne Tourism

2.1	Seasonal Estimates
It is estimated that 19,369 passengers landed in the Antarctic on 29 commercially-organized tour vessels plus numerous sailing vessels and/or yachts from November 2003 to March 2004. This represents a 46% increase over the 2002-2003 season where a total of 13,263 ship-based passengers was reported traveling aboard 26 vessels and sailing vessels/yachts. For the first time in four years seaborne tourist numbers landing in the Antarctic have risen since the millennium. 

IAATO members operated all but three of the tour vessels that sailed during the 2003 – 2004 season. IAATO’s Bylaws state that vessels carrying more than 500 do not land passengers ashore and that stringent landing restrictions are placed on vessels carrying more than 200 passengers at specific landing sites due to environmental considerations. Two of the vessels capable of carrying more than 500 passengers operated by non-IAATO companies landed more than 500 passengers. One of the two companies operating those vessels is interested in IAATO membership should IAATO raise the 500 limit. This particular company has been operating in the Antarctic since 1993, has been a Member in the past, and has sent a representative to IAATO’s General Meeting each year. The other company is not interested in becoming an IAATO Member nor did it send a representative to IAATO’s 2004 General Meeting. One cruise-only vessel operator did not advise IAATO or any other operator of its proposed itinerary, which posed a safety, logistical and potential environmental concern.

2.2	The vast majority of Antarctic voyages operate to the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from November – March), departing from Ushuaia, or, to a lesser extent, from Port Stanley, Punta Arenas, Valparaiso, Puerto Madryn, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. Of approximately 180 ship and sailing vessel/yacht voyages during the 2003-2004 season, some 172 voyages visited the Antarctic Peninsula region and seven voyages visited the Ross Sea/Continental area. A breakdown follows:

	2.3	Region visited		Activity	Number of 	Number of 
			Voyages	Persons
	Peninsula only		landings	161		14,902
	Peninsula only		cruise-only	4		4,949
	Peninsula/sailing vessels	landings	not available		185(approx.)*
	Ross Sea/Continental area	landings	7	489
	Land-based/Interior 	land-based	not relevant	517**

	*This is an estimate based on incomplete information from sailing vessel/yacht operators.
	**Previous land-based numbers through DAP were not available, so this figure is not comparable with previous statistics.

	The three large cruise vessels (Amsterdam, Royal Princess, and Asuka) carrying more than 500 passengers which conducted cruise-only operations visited Antarctica for a 72-hour time period on each cruise and carried a total of 4,949 passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area.

3.0	Commercial Antarctic Sailing Vessels and/or Yachts (Non-IAATO Operators)

Based on information received by the IAATO Secretariat, a total of 185 passengers were reported to have traveled to Antarctica aboard 20 or more non-IAATO operator operated commercial sailing vessels and/or yachts during the 2003-2004 season. This information is compiled at Palmer Station, Arthur Harbor, by US-NSF staff, and by information provided by the Antarctic Heritage Trust personnel at Port Lockroy. Several French sailing vessels/yachts were celebrating “Charcot’s” anniversary and supposedly spent a significant amount of time in the Peninsula. No detailed information is available.

3.1	Commercial sailing vessels/yachts with fare-paying passengers include the Pelagic and Pelagic Australis (IAATO Member Pelagic Expeditions) and Golden Fleece (IAATO Member Golden Fleece Expeditions) and Tooluka (IAATO Member BV Tooluka). Others (non-IAATO operators) are listed in the table “Overview of Non-IAATO Operated Sailing Vessels/Yachts 2003-04.” The IAATO Secretariat is in correspondence with several of the non-IAATO operated sailing vessels. Antarctic Treaty Parties permitting sailing vessel/yacht operations should encourage the use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO requests copies whenever possible of all Post Visit Site reports for non-member companies so that tourism data can be compiled on landing sites and overall numbers. This will also assist in compiling data for use in furthering the understanding of potential cumulative impacts. This same request was also made to ATCM XXV and to ATCM XXVI.

3.2	IAATO compiled the list of companies that operated during the 2003-2004 season so that National Programs that are overseeing sailing vessel/yacht activities from their respective countries can ensure that the Environmental Protocol requirements have been met. 

	3.3	Activities Conducted from Expedition Cruise Vessels
All activities are approved to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic Environment.

	3.3.1	Extended Kayak Trips
At least one IAATO member supported a group of kayakers on an extended 5 night camping expedition in the Antarctic Peninsula. 

	3.3.2	Camping in the Peninsula
Three IAATO Members offer camping as it provides an excellent opportunity for passengers to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica, separate from being on the ship. This activity has taken place for at least nine years in the Peninsula region. Campsites are generally located at least 650 ft from nesting birds, including penguins. Camping is on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites. Each campsite is used for no more than a few nights per season. Toilets are generally taken ashore, human waste returned to the ship and meals are only eaten on board the ship.

	3.3.3	Climbing and Kayaking from Ships in the Peninsula Area
Climbing and kayaking have proven to be successful activities for more than eight years in the Antarctic Peninsula area.

3.3.4	Scuba Diving
Scuba diving has been offered on some IAATO Member operated vessels for six years. During the 2003-2004 season three companies offered scuba diving. 

3.3.5	Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) 
An ROV has been used by one IAATO Member for at least three years. The ROV is used for educational purposes. Video footage is taken by the ROV and aired aboard ship for passengers to be able to experience first-hand the life under water. 

3.3.6	Amphibious All-Terrain Off-Road ATV Vehicles (Argos) 
Argos were used by one IAATO Member for at least the last three seasons.

3.3.7	Helicopter Operations 
Helicopter operations were conducted by one IAATO Member since the 1992-1993 season in the Ross Sea/Continental area of Antarctica. 




4.0	Commercial Land-based Tourism

4.1 	IAATO member Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions (ANI/ALE) operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the 17th consecutive season. ANI was purchased by ALE in 2003 by a group of experienced Antarctic adventurers, and carried a total of 111 clients plus eight mechanics. Activities included support services for private expeditions, along with organization and operation of expeditions. ANI/ALE’s operations included the following:

		ANI/ALE Aircraft Operations:
    • One Ilyushin-76 for was used to ferry cargo, fuel and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills for a total of eight flights.
    • One Twin-Otter aircraft, ski-equipped, was used for interior flights through the end of the Antarctic season. 

		Patriot Hills Camp:
    • Patriot Hills Camp opened 22 November 2003 and closed 30 January 2004. 

ANI/ALE organized/operated or provided logistics support for the following expeditions: 

Polar First (private expedition)	 2
Vinson Massif 	72
Vinson Massif and Last Degree	5
                                                South Pole Fly-In                                                2

                                                           Total     119

            	See Appendix D for additional information on private expeditions.
	
	4.2 	Air/ Land-based Activities 

In 2003-2004, there were 19 flights by Aerovias DAP in either a King Air or Dash 7 aircraft totaling 398 passengers. DAP offered flight seeing and a landing at King George Island. Passengers, accompanied by a guide, visited the Chilean, Russian and Chinese stations, and Villa las Estrellas (a Chilean settlement), and surrounding wildlife areas. This represents an increase from 128 passengers in 2002-2003. As of the 2003-2004 season DAP became an IAATO Member.

5.0	Air Operations – Flight Seeing 

5.1	IAATO Member Lan Chile operated 13 flights to the Antarctic Peninsula area in a 60-passenger capacity Boeing 737-200. A total of 679 passengers were carried during the 2003-2004 season. As of the 2003-2004 season Lan Chile became a member of IAATO.

The flying routes varied according to weather conditions but basically were conducted as follows:
    • King George Island, Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and 
Deception Islands (South Shetland Islands)
    • King George Island and the Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell Sea (in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands) with an over-flight near Marambio Station
    • Lan Chile operated an Eclipse Viewing Charter Flight.

Numerous flights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate from Punta Arenas but information on these flights prior to 2003-2004 had been difficult to obtain. 

Over-flights to the Antarctic Peninsula area from Punta Arenas operate frequently from November to March, by Lan Chile and Aerovias DAP. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers and independent travelers calling at Punta Arenas.  

5.2	During the 2003-2004 season Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia, operated six Antarctic day sightseeing flights, approximately 11-12 hours in duration, from Australia aboard a Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the ninth consecutive season. As of April 2004 Croydon Travel became an Associate Member of IAATO.  

A total of 2,827 passengers participated in six flights. In addition, the aircraft carried a total of 132 crew members during the season. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 72 flights carrying nearly 25,827 passengers since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The aircraft operate at a minimum altitude of 10,000 ft or 2,000 ft above the highest ground within 100 nautical miles. The flight itineraries primarily operate along the northern Victoria Land coast, and the Oates, George V and Adélie Coasts. Pilots avoid any known penguin colonies by a horizontal separation of at least one mile and Croydon staff provide a full in-flight lecture and education program utilizing at least three experienced lecturers and at least six videos. A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground-to-air interviews are conducted with staff members at Australian and occasionally at Italian bases.

6.0	Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2004-2005 Season

Appendix E illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that are expected to occur during the 2004-2005 season. This is an estimate based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat. Note that most all the activities listed have occurred in the past 12-13 years but have not necessarily been presented in such detail. IAATO is attempting to present as much factual information as possible in order to clarify activities that have occurred, and are planned for the future. The histogram in Appendix B illustrates estimated and actual tourism figures since the 1992-1993 season.

For the 2004-2005 season seaborne or ship-based tourism will once again include helicopter, Zodiac, and Argos operations, shore landings, camping, kayaking, scuba diving, climbing, and use of an underwater ROV.

6.1	According to estimates provided to IAATO by tour operators, during the 2004-2005 season 23,414 seaborne and sailing vessel/yacht passengers are expected to land in Antarctica on commercially-organized tour vessels and 526 on land-based expeditions. Another 4,500 are anticipated on cruise-only programs and 2,745 on over-flights. These figures represent increases in all categories from the 2003-2004 season. In addition, there are anticipated to be at least five departures by three IAATO-Members operating large vessels visiting the Antarctic Peninsula during the upcoming season.  
	
6.2	Non-IAATO operator activities are of considerable concern to IAATO. At least two of the 500+ capacity passenger vessel operators plan to land passengers in Antarctica over the course of nine departures. Also anticipated is one departure of a 350-passenger ship and 12 departures of a 100-passenger ship.

6.3	DAP is planning on flying passengers from Punta Arenas to King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at the Frei/Marsh area. In addition, there are three fly/cruise programs that include a flight from Punta Arenas to King George Island where passengers embark a ship (at Frei), sail and make landings in the Antarctic Peninsula for five days before flying back to Punta Arenas.

6.4	IAATO has not been informed of possible activities taking place in Dronning Maud Land during the 2004-2005 season. It is estimated that similar programs of 2003-2004 will be repeated. Updated details on environmental impact assessment and types of activities have not been provided to IAATO.

6.5	Some National Program vessels carry fare-paying passengers. National Programs are encouraged to report their passenger numbers and activities if they are landing at typical tourist sites so IAATO can account for the “footprint” and address cumulative impact issues. (Post Visit Site Reports should also be compiled for these activities.)

6.6	Some National Programs are supporting and/or transporting adventure travelers including climbers, skiers, etc., and are encouraged to report these activities for the 2004-2005 activities (and file Post Visit Site Reports). 

7.0	Antarctic Tourism Trends

	7.1	For the past 15 years, the US-NSF has compiled and distributed detailed information on Antarctic tourist activities. IAATO collaborates with US-NSF to ensure that all of the data on Antarctic tourism is represented, not just that of US organizers or IAATO Members. Appendices to this paper include tables and charts compiled by US-NSF and IAATO to reflect activities during the 2003-2004 season. This data is an invaluable resource, showing tourism activity at individual landing sites over time. 

7.2	The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under the category of “Tourism Statistics:” 
(1) Continental Sites, Ranking in the Top Five Most Visited Sites for the Last Twelve seasons (1992-2004)
(2) Summary of Continental Sites Visited by Tour Ships (2002-2004)
(3) Overview of Continental Sites Visited over Thirteen Seasons
(4) Fourteen-Season Overview of Sites Visited in the Antarctic Peninsula (1989-2004)
(5) 2003-2004 Summary of Peninsula Sites Visited by Tour Ships
		(6) Peninsula Sites Ranking in the Top 5 Most Visited Sites for the Last 15
		      seasons.
(7) 2003-2004 Passengers by Nationality
(8) 2003-2004 Nationalities of Seaborne and Land-Based Antarctic Passengers
(9) Comparison of Nationalities, 1994-2004
(10) Projected Trends in Antarctic Tourism
(11) 1992-2004 Antarctic Tourist Trends
(12) Summary of Seaborne and Land-Based Antarctic Tourism by Departures, 2003–2004

	7.3	IAATO currently predicts that Antarctic tourism will continue to grow both in seaborne and to a much lesser degree by land-based. The increase in numbers however doesn’t necessarily reflect impacts in the Antarctic nor is this an indication of how long passengers would be on land. IAATO will continue to monitor developments in the tourism industry. 

		Tourism in the Ross Sea region grew slightly during the 2003-2004 season, but there is little evidence that there will be significant increases in years to come. This is due to a limited operational season, and potentially restricted access to the Ross Sea and Continental area of the Antarctic.

8.0	Conclusion
In practice and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether or not associated with IAATO – are included in emergency contact and other information, scheduling, etc. Government and National Program representatives and prospective IAATO Members are encouraged to participate in open sessions of IAATO’s General Meeting where IAATO Bylaws, operating procedures, and policies are developed, as well as where obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System are discussed. 

IAATO-Member activities continue to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. IAATO as an organization is focused on minimizing impacts and consequently evaluates all relevant tourist activities. IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent as not all tourist activities are presently being reported.

Appendix D

Non-IAATO Independent Expeditions during the 2003-2004 Season:
Comments and Incidents

The following summary of activities conducted by expeditions with no affiliation to IAATO was gleaned from a variety of sources. None of the information was provided to IAATO directly. For details consult either the individuals or their National program offices, where permits may or may not have been acquired. Several IAATO members were approached by independent expeditions before and during the 2003-2004 season. The land-based IAATO member, Antarctic Logisitics and Expeditions/Adventure Network International (ALE/ANI), supported one independent expedition and had contact with three others that attempted but did not complete their objectives. Many of the expeditions described here are flight-based. IAATO’s comments are brief, including only basic information about the expeditions, but no conclusions drawn. Expedition requests encompass a range of objectives and IAATO members, in particular ALE/ANI, are prepared to support these where they can demonstrate a sufficiency of prior planning, procedures to minimise likely environmental effects, contingency plans including SAR, and adequate insurance cover.

Expeditions Supported by ALE/ANI
ALE/ANI supported only one independent expedition during the 2003-2004 season. Other expeditions formed part of ALE/ANI’s standard advertised activities. 

Polar First expedition was the first attempted helicopter flight to both Poles and was led by Jennifer Murray. ALE/ANI support included the following:
    • Considerable preparatory discussions to establish the ability of the expedition to meet the challenges it set itself. 
    • Assistance with EIA.
    • EIA was submitted and approved by US EPA.
    • Fuel caches at required intervals. The flight plan included a fuelling stop at Patriot Hills camp.
    • Full Search and Rescue back-up. This was limited to a tightly defined area, over which ALE/ANI could reasonably provide support, and during an agreed period. 
    • Positioning a DHC-6 Twin Otter at the southern end of the Antarctic Peninsula with a mountain rescue team on board to support the helicopter flight. 
    • The expedition had contacted IAATO (for ship operator assist) and advised where landings would take place in the Peninsula should search and rescue be needed. IAATO was grateful for the information, but advised that it couldn’t be included in the SAR as such.
Ultimately, the expedition reached the South Pole but failed due to a flying accident brought on by deteriorating weather conditions on the way north from Patriot Hills. A support aircraft was over the crash site within 40 minutes, homing in on Blue Sky Network beacon co-ordinates. A full medical team with supporting guides was at the site within 3 hours and a rescue effected. On arrival at the site, the medic called for the ALE/ANI aircraft in Punta Arenas to commence an evacuation flight that was completed successfully over the next 12 hours. USA and UK National operators offered humanitarian assistance, which was much appreciated but, in this instance, not required. Under Polar First’s IEE, the first stage of a clean up of the site was completed and funded by their insurers. For technical reasons, the second stage, complete removal of the damaged aircraft, was deferred until the 2004-2005 season.
Expeditions not supported by ALE/ANI
ALE/ANI was contacted by three other independent expeditions that were seeking support. Each in their way highlighted the problems that can be caused by commercial or National operators providing support without considering the consequences of the activity occurring.

Polly Vacher
The expedition plan was to fly single-handed across Antarctica from South America, through the Peninsula to McMurdo, with a possible crossing over the South Pole. The expedition received support from one IAATO member, one commercial contractor and three National operators. This support included placing of fuel caches, offering landing rights and search and rescue support. It was permitted by the U.K. ALE/ANI decided not to support the expedition because they felt it was operating over an area that was impossible to give full SAR back-up, and it was unclear from discussions with the organisers who were providing such support. It was therefore determined not to work with the expedition.  Information published on web pages indicated that the flight was proposing to land at Patriot Hills to refuel. ALE/ANI made it clear to the organisers by phone and email before the flight commenced that we would not provide fuel or other support. Despite this ALE/ANI were pestered, even after the expedition had started, by numerous emails and phone calls by the organisers and their backers, and U.S. supporters, to provide fuel and/or SAR support. All requests were declined as ALE/ANI did not have the resources to provide SAR. It appears that the National and commercial operators that did provide support had not considered the likely consequences of that commitment. In the end, the expedition was defeated by adverse weather and, fortunately, required no more than further fuel supplies to extricate itself from Antarctica.

Jon Johanson
A second Antarctic crossing flight was attempted from the Ross Sea sector. This was well published and failed due to insufficient planning and back-up, and a lack of pre-arranged fuel caches. ALE/ANI was contacted during the early stages of the flight to provide fuel in the Ross Sea area and at Patriot Hills. This was declined as the expedition did not appear to be properly funded and ALE/ANI was fully committed to its own operations. The expedition was permitted by Australia but was not financially supported by any National or commercial operators but was able to take advantage of the fuel cached in the Ross Sea sector for Polly Vacher but not used by her.  When permitting such activities governments should be cautious in approving operations as such or governments and commercial operators could develop a reputation as able to provide Antarctic “fuelling stations”. ALE/ANI, in particular, wishes to avoid having inferred third party responsibility for search and rescue that may come with providing fuel to an otherwise independent expedition.  

Gus McLeod
ALE/ANI was also contacted by McLeod for support for his Antarctic flight. The expedition was planned for a period after ALE/ANI’s Patriot Hills camp was due to close and after their Twin Otters had left Antarctica. They therefore declined any support. 
The expedition submitted operational documentation to US EPA. In this submission it noted that “McLeod does not anticipate landing in Antarctica; only do an overflight of the South Pole.” An IAATO Associate Member offered emergency support from King George Island/Marsh back to Chile. One non-IAATO commercial air operator was contacted for continental support. It is unclear if continental support was actually agreed to in final planning. In ALE/ANI’s view, it was this support that was crucial to the expedition being able to progress. 
The expedition departed Ushuaia and flew to Marambio station for refueling, returned once again to Ushuaia and departed once more hoping to fly to the South Pole. In the event, poor weather prevented the crossing and the aircraft had to return to South America. It later crashed north of Buenos Aires, fortunately without loss of life. Marambio wasn’t included in the initial planning documentation.
