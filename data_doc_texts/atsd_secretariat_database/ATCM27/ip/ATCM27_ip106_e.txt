Executive Summary

The focus of Antarctic research on its flora and fauna is very much on developing the knowledge base. Industries point to this situation as the reason for their limited focus on Antarctic organisms. Although they do express a general interest in samples, obtaining them does not form a central part of their strategy.  Factors that were cited as limiting interest in Antarctica research by companies included: incomplete knowledge-base of Antarctic biodiversity, the current economic situation, lack of ownership of the samples, and uncertainty relating to intellectual property rights and commercial exploitation

Given the high risk and cost involved in pursuing this largely unexplored field, the number of companies involved in funding Antarctic research, screening samples and applying for Antarctic-based patents is restricted.

Some noteworthy discoveries based on Antarctic organisms and with potential commercial applications have been made in collaboration with industrial partners. However, it appears that none of these discoveries have led to commercialisation yet. Possibly the closest to commercialisation is the development of an anti-cancer drug involving an enzyme from Antarctica, which was isolated by the University of Cambridge, New Zealand, and is undergoing clinical testing by PharmaMar, a pharmaceutical company based in Spain. Recently, this work has stalled due to the companies’ financial difficulties.

Arrangements between industrial and academic partners relating to the ownership of samples and to the sharing of potential benefits range from gentlemen’s agreements foreseeing negotiations to this end once product development is imminent, to specific agreements on royalties and instalment payments made to the isolating institution. The role of the State whose claimed territory the sample was collected from is neither always clear, nor addressed. Ownership of the samples generally lies with the academic partner.

Patent applicants are largely pharmaceutical, chemical and food companies. Most patents are process, rather than product-based and centre around an isolate from an organism (frequently from the yeast Candida antarctica), rather than on a synthetic derivative.

Delays in the exchange of data and information have been attributed more too practical matters, such as insufficiently user-friendly databases, than due to patent restrictions or conscious withholding of information.

As a result of the above, industry, researchers and governments all stand to benefit if clear simple and practical rules governing the use of genetic resources in Antarctica were to be developed. 

1	Introduction

This study follows up on the UNU/IAS Report “The International Regime on Bioprospecting: Existing Policies and Emerging Issues for Antarctica”, published in August 2003 and presented to the 26th session of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXVI) as Information Paper 75. It is compiled in response to an ATCM decision to include the issue of biological prospecting activities on the preliminary agenda of its 27th session, to be convened in May 2004.

The 2003 UNU/IAS Report included a desktop review on the extent of bioprospecting, their commercial value and likely trends. It concluded that determining these issues will require a further survey of the relevant activities in Antarctica, the sectors using genetic material from Antarctica, research programmes most directly involved, and records of the appropriate patent offices. This study aims to answer some of these questions, in particular those relating to which sectors use Antarctic genetic material, and what indications records of patent offices give regarding these sectors’ focus on Antarctic-based commercialisation.

The present study was undertaken by drawing primarily on interviews with industry representatives and academics, as well as on records found in publicly-available patent databases. One clear limitation in researching the role of industry in any given subject matter is industry’s concern regarding confidentiality, and thus its frequent reluctance to share information that goes beyond promotional public knowledge. This constraint, evidenced by several companies’ refusal to speak about the subject matter, was dealt with by using as far as possible information made available by academics working with industry partners. 

The next section will outline the information gained through the interviews. Subsequently, information relating to patents and patent applicants will be presented, before drawing some conclusions. 




2	Industry’s Interest: Interview Results

In the 2003 UNU/IAS Report, mention was made of Micromat, a public-private consortium whose aim was to conduct research into Antarctic microorganisms. Unlike deemed in the 2003 Report, such consortia are not frequent. Indeed, only one other comparable consortium, between the Australian-based pharmaceutical Cerylid Biosciences and the former Australian Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre (Antarctic CRC), has been identified. It is worthwhile to consider Micromat and the Antarctic CRC-pharmaceutical cooperation more closely, as it is conceivable that such collaboration agreements will become more attractive in the future.

Micromat, a project funded by the European Commission under its Fourth EU Framework  Programme and running from 1999 to 2001, involved the Universities of Liège (Belgium), Ghent (Belgium), Bordeaux (France) and Nottingham (UK), the DSMZ (Germany), the British Antarctic Survey (UK), Merck Sharp & Dohme (Spain), Genencor International, and Biosearch – now Vicuron – (Italy). Its aim was to improve knowledge of the biodiversity of bacteria, protists and fungi in Antarctic microbial mats and to test this biodiversity for novel compounds of potential biotechnological use.1 In accordance with the consortium agreement, the research institutions conducted the microbiotic work, while the industrial partners screened the purified strains for commercially interesting activities. Logistic support had been provided by Australia and, indirectly, by the US.

Merck Sharp & Dohme (Spain) 
Merck Sharp & Dohme (Spain) is the name under which the US multinational pharmaceutical company Merck & Co operates in Spain. Merck & Co is a leading research-driven pharmaceutical company, whose human health products include medicines to help treat high blood pressure, osteoporosis and migraine. Worldwide sales in 2002 were over US$21 billion. In 2002, Merck invested almost US$2.7 billion in research and development. More than US$18 billion have been invested in research and development over the past 10 years. Merck has over 64,000 employees.  

According to Merck Sharp & Dohme (Spain), the strains were tested generally, rather than for specific purposes, and the work of the company was heavily restricted by its US lawyers on the grounds that they were not the owners of the strains. 

Genencor International
Genencor International is one of the top 20 biotechnology companies, with US$350 million in 2002 revenues and some 1,300 employees. From 1997-2001, Genecor International has invested approximately US$232 million into research and development. It focuses on the bioproducts and health care markets, discovering and developing biochemicals for the industrial, consumer and agro-processing markets, and drugs targeting viral infectious diseases and cancer. 

In contrast to Merck Sharp & Dohme, Genencor focused its screening activities on bacterial enzymes in particular, which had been isolated by Ghent University and the DSMZ. The bacterial enzymes were not the property of the industry according to the consortium agreement, but remain the property of the laboratory, which has isolated the bacteria. In the case of commercialisation, a provision, which remains active despite the project’s termination, stipulates that the industry would have to consult both with the original isolators, and with the government whose sector the sample was taken from. Micromat represented Genencor’s first activity with regard to Antarctic microorganisms. Thus, Genencor did not expect the work to lead to product development, but rather considered it as a learning phase. The bacteria, which remain in Genencor’s culture collections, have been re-examined in the summer of 2003 as part of a short screening project. Although no commercially-exploitable activities were identified, the microorganisms are likely to be examined again when screening for another characteristic will be undertaken.

In contrast to Merck Sharp & Dohme, Genencor International did not highlight the constraints of its work imposed as a result of the lack of ownership of the genetic material, but instead underscored that the consortium provided it with a framework for obtaining interesting genetic samples in a legal manner. Another similar EU-funded project in China, which also involves collaboration with public and private partners, provides a similar opportunity to gain access to sample material. One problem identified with regard to working on Antarctic microorganisms is that they are difficult to grow and genetically very poorly characterised. The interviewee also pointed to the lag time between developing a sufficient knowledge base about an organism, and the commercial development on the basis of the organism. Thus, while Genencor is interested in Antarctic samples, it does not expect to conduct intense work on Antarctic microorganisms until the knowledge base on them is further developed. Moreover, given that  industry’s result-driven character, the interviewee said that Genencor would “never” pay for researchers to “just” study Antarctic microbes, as this is considered a purely academic exercise too costly to the private sector. Finally, the company’s involvement could in future be limited if it involves negotiating for months whether, or how, it will obtain samples.

Vicuron Pharmaceuticals
Vicuron Pharmaceuticals is the result of a merger between Versicor Inc. and Biosearch Italia S.p.A, consummated in February 2003. Its lead products are in Phase III clinical trials and include an intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. Commercialisation of its products is pending.

The third industrial partner, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals (formerly Biosearch), explained that its focus in this project was on strains able to produce anti-freeze molecules or activities. In the search for anti-infective strains, some microorganisms were submitted to secondary tests. These showed, however, that the microorganisms had low activity-levels, known active molecules, or that they were toxic to mammalian cells. Such findings are usual, and illustrate the low success rate in screening. Like Genencor, Vicuron highlighted the advantage of collaboration agreements for the purposes of obtaining microbial strains, and noted that the company management would not fund employers to collect samples in Antarctica. The interviewee noted that although Vicuron has a general interest for setting up collaboration agreements to obtain Antarctic strains, currently this is not being pursued because the company has sufficient strains from other parts of the world to screen.

Micromat coordinator Annick Wilmotte from Liège University (Belgium) explained that the arrangement with Australia was that data collected on the basis of the samples would be made available to all partners through a database. However, due to the fact that the database was insufficiently user-friendly, delays in this commitment occurred. She noted that the consortium agreement included one paragraph relating to intellectual property right, which stipulates that in the case of an industrial application, negotiations would be held involving all Parties, including the relevant Claimant State (in this case, Australia). However, it has not come to this, yet. Her interpretation of industry’s interest in Antarctic microorganisms is that it is high, but lack of funding prevents fully pursuing these interests. She also explained that under the 6th European Framework Programme little hope exists for similar projects as the guidelines foresee consortia with a significantly larger number of participants, an aspect that would make it more difficult to reach agreement on as difficult and complex an issue as intellectual property rights.

Dominic Hodgson, British Antarctic Survey, explained that under Micromat, industry screened 3,500 organisms, but that it would take some 8-10 years between research on these organisms and products entering the market because:
    • the knowledge base remains to be fully developed
    • present products have to be proven to be inadequate
    • a “gap” in the market place must become available
Confirming statements made by industry, he noted that companies are generally interested in obtaining Antarctic microorganisms, but are not willing to make significant financial investments to this end. He explained that Antarctic microorganisms still have a relatively small profit margin, with no major results obtained yet. According to his interpretation, biological prospecting activities have not in fact been increasing, but rather the awareness of such activities and the drive under the Antarctic Treaty System to manage these activities have increased. He also noted that technological improvements are underway, with companies being able to screen larger amounts of samples in less time.

David Nichols, formerly with the Antarctic CRC and now at the University of Tasmania, Australia, said the Antarctic CRC had had a commercial agreement between 1995 and 2002 with the Australian pharmaceutical company Cerylid Ltd concerning the isolation and provision of Antarctic bacteria isolated from, primarily, Antarctic soil samples. He said the commercial partner’s screening of the isolates for human pharmaceuticals is ongoing, and might involve sharing the isolates with another company to further advance the screening process. The agreement contains a provision according to which royalties will flow back to the Antarctic CRC or its members. Regarding the isolates’ ownership, the agreement provided that the pharmaceutical company did not own them, but that they were provided for a limited time period for a specific task, following which ownership would go back to the Antarctic CRC. He said such public-private partnerships for isolates screening are relatively rare. He noted that there is a slow shift in focus from thermophilic to cold-active enzymes. 

Michael Danson from Bath University (UK) has conducted Antarctic bioprospecting activities that were funded to 50% by the British Research Council, and to 50% by Glaxo Smith Kline, Reckitt Benckiser, and Veridian Enviro Solutions. He said the companies expressed concern about legal issues surrounding this work, as they were reluctant to invest into developing enzymes if they were to find that they could not exploit them. The agreement reached was no more than a gentleman’s agreement, according to which an agreement, involving royalties going back to Waikato University, the supplier of the organisms, would be reached before exploitation would start. 

Reckitt-Benckiser (UK)
With some 22,300 employees and over US$3,500 million in 2002 sales, Reckitt-Benckieser is a leading player in the market for household cleaning products. It also produces over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, including analgesics, antiseptics, flu remedies and gastrointestinal medications. 

Reckitt-Benckiser (UK) said that extremophiles are of general interest to the industry, but must not necessarily originate from Antarctica. As such, Antarctic research is not at the forefront of its strategy, as opposed to in 2001 when it supported Michael Danson’s work. No specific reason is attributable to this change in strategy, which changes frequently and rapidly due to the company’s result-driven focus. The interviewee noted that the drawback of Antarctic projects include their long-term character, high risk and high cost; and explained that the agreement reached with the two other industrial partners and Danson are confidential and thus details of property ownership and commercialisation agreements cannot be disclosed.


Unilever (UK)
Unilever is one of the world’s leading suppliers of consumer goods in foods, household and personal care product. Unilever UK has 12,000 employers and annual UK sales of over £2,5 billion. Over 5 years up to 2006, Unilever UK is investing £13 million in the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics, a partnership with Cambridge University’s chemistry department.

Unilever (UK) said it had started working on Antarctic microorganisms in the 1980s with several universities in, amongst others, the UK, Norway, and the US. This effort has been discontinued, however, as the work remains largely pre-commercial and pre-exploitative. 

Nicholas Russell from Imperial College London (UK) outlined a European-funded project called “Coldzyme”, whose main industrial partner was Unilever (The Netherlands) and whose aim was to identify and describe bacteria with cold-active enzymes. Under the project, cultures were collected, bacteria catalogued and preliminary research conducted on enzymes. Funding was discontinued when the project entered its second phase to investigate potential applications of the enzymes. The reasons for this remain unclear. He said industry’s funding of Antarctic research has been low due to the fact that they cannot claim ownership of the Antarctic microorganisms, and mentioned that colleagues have discontinued cooperation with some industries as these had insisted on claiming ownership of the microorganism studied. He said that industry is waiting for more basic research before dealing with Antarctic microorganisms more intensively. He noted that while no Antarctic-based product or process has been commercialised to date, and it therefore remains to be seen how ownership issues will be solved, the fact that the microorganisms are usually genetically modified for this purpose may support the argument that the product or process is not “Antarctic-based” as such. He questioned whether Antarctic bioprospecting activities themselves have increased over the past decade.

Jim Raymond from Nevada University (US), engaged in research on algal-based anti-freeze proteins, explained that the fish-based anti-freeze protein had a lot of promise but has so far failed to give rise to any specific products. He said much interest around this issue is present, but a lot of basic research remains to be done, and noted that fish anti-freezes can be obtained either by harvesting fish, which is wasteful, or by transposing the relevant genes into bacteria and cultivate them, which is relatively costly. He said that Unilever had expressed interest in these proteins (Unilever, however, did not confirm this). According to his knowledge, not product or process based on Antarctic microorganisms has been commercialised yet. He noted that Nevada University does not have any type of agreement with another institution/country regarding its anti-freeze research as the algae in question are not endemic to the Antarctic environment and could be collected from other parts of the world if restrictions were imposed on their collection in Antarctica.

David Saul from the University of Auckland (New Zealand) said that the thermophilic enzyme, isolated 15 years ago from an organism found in a volcanic vent in Mount Erebus, is expected to be commercialised for forensic work. The enzyme has unusually high levels of activity of extracting DNA from forensic material. Interest in the enzyme has been expressed by many forensic institutions scientists, the Australian Department of Justice and the Crown Prosecutor of the Northern Territory, Australia. Current negotiations with Antarctica New Zealand are to reveal whether they will demand royalties on any potential commercial success. (Details about the negotiations were not obtained). He noted that the enzyme in question is very similar to others from extremely hot environments, and said that the difficulty with cold-loving organisms is that their genes, when transposed into a medium-temperature organism, often fail. Regarding potential restrictions on Antarctic bioprospecting activities, he said that given the vast microbial flora in any site around the world, researchers would simply go elsewhere. However, he noted that a restriction may not be necessary given that much bioprospecting is being undertaken as part of other research projects.

Murray Munro from the University of Canterbury (New Zealand) explained that PharmaMar (Spain) started funding the University’s Antarctic bioprospecting work some 12 years ago. The research led to the isolation of variolin from an Antarctic sponge, synthetic derivatives of variolin were developed and patented by PharmaMar, and are now being developed as an anti-cancer drug. Currently, the derivatives are being tested in vivo, which in terms of drug development means that about 50% of the work has been completed. The University of Canterbury’s agreement with PharmaMar foresees that royalties of any commercial products will be paid, and also provides for milestone payment. Figures and further details are confidential. He noted that PharmaMar’s current financial difficulties have led to the stalling of any further work.
PharmaMar is Spain’s main biopharmaceutical company, focusing on research and development of anti-tumour compounds from marine organisms.

Figure 1: Number of patent applicants per country (1988-2003)

The patents examined indicate a recent decrease in patents granted. Thus, between 2002 and 2003, 6 patents were issued, whereas 10 patents were granted between 1996 and 1997. Prior to this, fewer patents were granted, with one being issued between 1990 and 1991 (See Figure 2).


Figure 2: Number of patents granted (per biennium)


Most patents filed are process- rather than product-based, with many relating to the yeast Candida antarctica. The distinction between process- and product-based patents is determined by whether the invention relates to a product or to a process. 

Candida antarctica
Candida antarctica, one of 154 species of the genus Candida, belongs to the Phylum Ascomycota and to the Class Ascomycetes. It is an alkali-tolerant yeast found in the sediment of Lake Vanda, Antarctica. Two lipase variants from Candida antarctica, lipase A and B, have proven of particular interest to researchers (lipase being enzymes that break down fats).


Examples of process-based patents relate to:
    • the preparation of optically active amines, which are prepared in the presence of lipase from the Antarctic yeast Candida antarctica. The amines can be used as intermediates for preparing pharmaceuticals and crop protection agents (US6387692)
    • the preparation of esters in the presence of Candida antarctica lipase A, or a variant thereof. The esters are useful as ingredients in fat blends such as margarine (WO0153511)
    • the enzymatic synthesis of polyesters in the presence of a lipase derived from, amongst others, Candida antarctica. The polyesters are useful in formulating products such as skin creams and cosmetics as they normally function as thickeners or softeners in such formulations (US5962624)
    • the enzymatic resolution of certain esters, using Candida antarctica lipase fraction B as enzyme catalyst. The products of this invention are useful as precursors for chemicals of high value in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industry (US5928933)
    • the preparation of a certain acid ethyl ester with lipase from Candida antarctica. The ester is the flavouring that is the character impact compound of William pears. Unlike according to the invented process, the old way of preparing the ester did not result in it being a natural substance in the context of food law and therefore could not be called a natural aroma substance (US5753473)
    • the preparation of a triglyceride in the presence of a mixture of lipase A and lipase B obtained from Candida antarctica. The triglycerides have beneficial medical effects (US5604119)
    • the preparation of an optically active ester using an enzyme originating from Candida antarctica. The ester can be used for preparing pharmaceuticals such as benzothiazepines and benzazepines (US5407828)
    • the immobilisation of thermostable microbial lipase, preferably from Candida antarctica. The immobilised lipase can be used for hydrolysis of fats (US5342768)
    • the hydrolysis of water-insoluble ester in the presence of a lipase derived from a strain of Candida antarctica. The ester hydrolysis can be applied to hydrolysis of resin ester. This is useful as some types of pulp made from wood have high resin content, and the resin can create disturbances in the process of pulp manufacture and may have negative effects on the properties of the final pulp product (WO9218638)
    • the production of optically active carboxylic acid in the presence of Candida antarctica or lipase originated there from. The carboxylic acid is useful as an intermediate for producing industrial chemicals, agrochemicals or medical agents (JP2003144190)
    • the decomposing of soy sauce oil with the yeast Candida antarctica T-24 in order to generate soy sauce oil as a by-product in a soy sauce brewing method (JP2002101847)
    • the production of a specific polymer not containing a metal atom in the presence of a lipase originating from Candida antarctica. The polymer can be useful for medical equipment (JP2000044658)
    • the production of a particular furanone compound in the presence of a lipase from Candida antarctica. The compound has a sweet fruity fragrance and can be useful as food perfume (JP10084988)
    • the production of an optically active compound in the presence of a hydrolase originating from fungi such as a lipase from Candida antarctica. The compound is useful as a synthetic intermediate for medicines and agrochemicals (JP7115992)
    • the use of a glycoprotein produced by Pseudoalteromonas antarctica in the preparation of pharmaceutical, veterinary and cosmetic compositions for topical or mucosal application aimed at the treatment and re-epithelialisation of wounds (WO02102406)
    • the use of an extract from the green alga Prasiola crispa spp. Antarctica for cosmetic skin treatment, care or protection, including as sun protector and after-sun cream (WO0238121)

Product-based patents relate to: 
    • the development of frozen confectionary products, such as ice cream, comprising one or more anti-freeze proteins derived from plants, including from the Antarctic-based Nothofagus antarctica, Deschampsia antarctica and Umbilicaria antarctica. The anti-freeze proteins inhibit ice recrystallisation and thus provide a good texture to frozen confectionary product  (GB19970014412)
    • the development of a Candida antarctica lipase A and a variant thereof, which can be used as a detergent enzyme or digestive enzyme, or to avoid pitch trouble arising inter alia in processes for preparing mechanical pulp in paper-making processes using mechanical pulp (US6074863)
    • a glycoprotein obtained by culture of the bacterial species Pseudoalteromonas antarctica CECT4664, which is useful for coating liposomes in order to improve their stability in relation to external factors such as surfactants (WO9842731)
    • a thermally stable lipase native to Candida antarctica, to be used for processing high-melting substrates at 60ºC for, inter alia, the randomisation of fat in the margarine industry (US5273898)
    • the production of a particular stimulating agent containing the extract of an alga belonging to the genus Durvillea, including Durvillea antarctica. The stimulating agent prevents the development of skin wrinkles (JP9176036)




The above shows that sectors where patents have potential applications include the pharmaceutical, agriculture, food, cosmetics and chemistry sectors (See Figure 3).

5	Conclusion

This study has shown that while products or processes based on Antarctic organisms have not yet been commercialised, the scope for such a development exists. Not only do some Antarctic extremophiles exhibit potentially exploitable characteristics, but industry has also displayed an interest in screening these organisms. Restrained by the incomplete knowledge-base of Antarctic biodiversity and the current economic situation, companies have not made it a priority to focus their attention on Antarctic samples, as the cost, risk and time involved do not concur with the necessity to generate marketable products. 

The number of patents issued appears to support the interpretation that, following a period of greater anticipation in face of the opening of a new “frontier”, companies have reduced the intensity of their involvement in the light of the yet-to-be developed knowledge base. In addition, lack of ownership of the samples, and uncertainty relating to intellectual property rights and commercial exploitation are likely to have acted as disincentives.
Given that the largest part of inventions are of relevance to the pharmaceutical industry, a breakthrough commercialisation can be expected to attract a significant amount of publicity and thus, revived interest by companies. Moreover, since rules regarding access, sample ownership, benefit-sharing and intellectual property rights would provide certainty to both academic researchers and industries, they may be favourable disposed towards attempts to address the absence of such rules.

The data used in this study does not give a clear indication of the different roles assumed by claimant and non-claimant States. 

Factors that seem to influence a company’s interest in Antarctic samples are not only its financial situation, but also its focus on research and development, as well as its existing expertise in working with extremophiles. If bioprospecting is to continue in a similar form as it has up to date, i.e. as part of wider research projects and with the sampling being undertaken by academic researchers, it should be in the interest of the international community as a whole to develop a framework under which the commitments of the Antarctic Treaty are honoured, and the opportunity for developing necessary products or processes maintained.
