REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ANTARCTICA TOUR OPERATORS 2003-2004 UNDER ARTICLE III (2) OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY


























Report of the International Association of 
Antarctica Tour Operators
2003-2004
Under Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty


The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities to ATCM XXVII, Cape Town, South Africa, 24 May to 04 June 2004, in relation to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty.

IAATO is a member organization founded by seven companies in 1991 to advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic. During the 2003-2004 season IAATO had 57 Members, and as of May 1, 2004, the Association grew to 70 Members. The 2003-2004 season was estimated to be the most active yet since tourism began in the 1960’s. Whereas tourism numbers reached nearly 28,000, including seaborne, air- and land-based tourism, the season went smoothly with no ship or aircraft incidents. 

Despite the increase in tourism numbers, operations went smoothly and IAATO Members implemented established practices that have proved to be effective and practical. Members are competitors of one another yet they are willing to work closely together to develop, agree to and impose best practices upon themselves. This process is rare and for the most part unprecedented anywhere in the tourism world. 

As an Association, IAATO seeks to raise the operational standards of Members and the industry as a whole. To do so requires an infrastructure, a forum and a time and economic commitment by each company. 

IAATO has continued to focus its activities in several key areas including:
    • Providing a forum for Members to be able to successfully resource information needed to effectively manage Antarctic Tourism, 
    • Improving vessel scheduling in the Antarctic Peninsula,
    • Improving vessel communication methods via the GMDSS and INM-C system for safety and itinerary planning purposes,
    • Updating the Emergency Medical Evacuation Response (EMER) Plan,
    • Trial-testing the IAATO Site Specific Guidelines (ATCM XXVI IP72) and the nine Site Specific Guidelines prepared by the United Kingdom (three of which were submitted to ATCM XXVI/WP26) to evaluate their effectiveness to address impacts and concern towards growth in the tourism industry,
    • Stressing the concern towards the potential spreading of Antarctic diseases and prevention methods and encouraging stricter boot washing and clothing checks,
    • Enhancing IAATO standard operating procedures,
    • Participating in several Intersessional Working Groups (ICG’s) and the ATME in Norway,
    • Participating in international meetings and liaising with National Antarctic Programs, government agencies of the sub-Antarctic island groups, and scientific and environmental organizations,
    • Improving data collection and exchange of information procedures among Members,
    • Closely coordinating with Provisional Members in their start-up operations,
    • Furthering work on the new IAATO database and the IAATO web site (anticipated to be operational by mid-August, 2004).

	Article II: Objectives, Section E: 
Members of IAATO subscribe to the principle that their planned activities will have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. 

Bylaws and Objectives are only a small part of the detailed operating strategies IAATO has developed over the last 13 years in order to effectively manage Members’ activities. 



2	2003-2004 Statistics

   2.1		Member Activities
		From November 2003 to March 2004, a total of 14,902 passengers landed in the Antarctic by privately-organized Member companies, including passengers aboard 28 commercially-organized small expedition vessels plus 517 land-based visitors. In addition, 4,747 tourists travelled on two Member large cruise vessels (on 3 departures) that did not land tourists and spent approximately 72 hours each trip south of 60ºS in Antarctica. Of note, is that one group of 37 tourists (included above) participated in the first air-cruise program. Over-flights carried 679 tourists on Member aircraft departing from Chile. 

A complete overview of the tourism industry can be found in the IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism  (ATCM XXVII-IP)
	
2.2	Tourism numbers increased during the 2003-2004 season and reached their highest levels to date. Data on tourism activities and actual numbers of non-IAATO operators has become more readily available over the years and, therefore, overall numbers are higher this year not only because of better statistical data being available, but also because of an increase in the Antarctic tourism industry as a whole.

3 	Participation in Organized Meetings during 2003-2004

3.1	IAATO held its 15th General Meeting, April 27-30, 2004 in Christchurch, New Zealand. A total of 89 people attended which included 59 from 36 Member companies including some new Provisional and Associate Member applicants, one non-IAATO operator plus 29 invited representatives from government, universities, and conservation and private organizations. The complete agenda can be found on IAATO’s web site at www.iaato.org. Several Members once again sponsored the attendance of their expedition leaders, which proved useful for better field communication and understanding of the industry as a whole. Included in this year’s agenda was a discussion on IAATO business, marine-related topics, liaison with representatives from the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO), accreditation and observer schemes, environmental and cumulative impacts, operational issues, land-based tourism and an examination of site guidelines. 

Attending were representatives from Antarctica New Zealand, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Conservation-New Zealand, New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, British Antarctic Survey/UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Office of Polar Programs US National Science Foundation, Raytheon Polar Services, Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency-Germany), International Hydrographic Organisation/International Hydrographic Bureau (IHO/IHB), Netherlands Institute for the Law of the Sea, Australian Antarctic Division, the government of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Antarctic Killer Whale Inventory Catalogue, Oceanites, University of Canterbury, Lincoln University, and the University of Tasmania. 

IAATO will hold its 16th General Meeting in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 2005 (dates will most likely be May 2-5, 2005). Interested parties that would like to attend or participate should contact the IAATO Secretariat at iaato@iaato.org.

        3.2 IAATO was very pleased to send two participants to the IHO/IHB Meeting in Monaco in September 2003. IAATO supports and encourages the work the IHO is doing on improving charting and navigational aids in Antarctica and other parts of the world. Safety and navigation are extremely important concerns to vessel operators who feel that improved charting will greatly reduce the risk of accidents and potential environmental damage. IAATO looks forward to attending the next IHO/IHB meeting in Greece, 2004.

        3.3 IAATO sent three representatives to Norway to attend the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts in March 2004. The meeting proved to be an excellent forum for discussing various tourism-related issues. IAATO is grateful to Norway for organizing this meeting.

        3.4 Several IAATO Members met with their various governments during the last year to discuss tourism issues in the Antarctic and Arctic. Members felt that these meetings proved extremely useful. IAATO encourages Parties to interact with their resident tour operators whenever possible so that both stakeholders can gain a better understanding of each other’s concerns. 

        3.5 Several IAATO Members met in October 2003 and formed the Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operator’s Organization (AECO) in order to better address Arctic (particularly Svalbard) concerns.

4	Field Coordination

4.1	IAATO compiles information, including vessel call data, ship schedules, emergency contact information, expedition leader schedules, etc., in IAATO’s annual tourism reports and yearly exchange of information for Members and non-IAATO operators (if received). IAATO is committed to compiling the most up-to-date information to capture statistics on the tourism industry.

4.2	IAATO’s comprehensive directory of vessel call data, ship schedules are shared with with COMNAP and governments to encourage improved communication and operational coordination. COMNAP’s MINIATOM is an extremely useful tool for tour operators trying to contact stations or government vessels. As IAATO vessels transport numerous scientists and support personnel to Antarctica each year in addition to requesting tourist visits to stations, it is helpful when station contact information is up-to-date for communication, planning and emergency purposes. IAATO also encourages COMNAP to have an emergency call list of commercial operators to contact in case of emergencies. One such emergency occurred during the 2003-2004 season and required such coordination.

4.3	Preliminary detailed cruise itineraries are compiled by the IAATO Secretariat and distributed to Antarctic vessel operators, National Antarctic Programs, where appropriate, COMNAP, SCAR, In.Fue.Tur and others in advance of the season.

4.4	Expedition leaders and ship's officers circulate advance day-to-day itineraries and maintain regular contact throughout the season to coordinate site visits and exchange general information such as ice conditions, weather, landing recommendations, concern about potential environmental impacts, etc. A key factor in managing Antarctic tourism and mitigating potential environmental impact is to ensure that no two ships land passengers at the same place at the same time. An example of the annual instructions to ships’ captains, radio officers and expedition leaders is included as Appendix A. 
	
	IAATO changed its way of organizing ship schedules this past season and found a more effective way to communicate with one another. Members submit their day-to-day itineraries for the upcoming season to IAATO by June 30. The IAATO Secretariat compiles a master list, returns it by August 1 and Members then work out any ship conflicts and resubmit their final schedule back to the IAATO Secretariat for distribution to Members and various government agencies in order to ensure an effective management of vessels. Once in the field expedition leaders and ship officers communicate as noted in Appendix A. This system turned out to be a much more effective way to communicate than in years past. Non-IAATO operators are encouraged to participate in this system. This system provides information on the general area where tour vessels are on a day-to-day basis in Antarctica. Any last-minute changes are worked out between the expedition leaders once in Antarctica.

4.5	Details on IAATO’s Emergency Medical Evacuation Response plan (EMER) have been presented at previous ATCMs. IAATO Member Aerovias DAP offered this service for Members during the 2003-2004 season. Aerovias DAP performed a total of five medical evacuations from King George Island, two on behalf of Members.  

5	Environmental Impact Assessment 

5.1	Argentina, Australia, Chile, Germany, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom and United States received Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA’s) from Members operating vessels or land-based programs. IAATO is aware that over 20 non-IAATO operated sailing vessels/yachts carrying approximately 185 persons did not submit Advance Notification, EIA’s or file Post Visit Site Reports. IAATO feels that these numbers are high enough to cause concern.

5.2	As IAATO is concerned about non-IAATO operator activities, the Association urges Contracting Parties to ensure that obligations of the Environmental Protocol are being met and that Environmental Impact Assessments are being submitted and that detailed mitigation measures are included.

5.3	IAATO would also request that when non-IAATO operators submit EIA’s that  not possible for non-IAATO operators to have the breadth or understanding of the numerous operating strategies IAATO has developed over the years. This statement appeared in at least two non-IAATO operator IEE’s prior to the 2003-2004 season. Non-IAATO operators do not receive regular updates and briefings from IAATO. Some non-IAATO operators are copied in on Vessel Call Data, exchange of itineraries, and other impromptu matters. Governments permitting and/or assessing non-IAATO operators may need to provide additional information on suggested operating procedures or consider placing an observer on board to monitor environmental concerns.




6	Procedures to Prevent the Introduction of Alien Organisms

6.1	For the past five seasons, IAATO’s Boot and Clothing Decontamination Recommended Guidelines and Translocation of Diseases Protocol have proven to be effective. These guidelines unofficially have been operative for the last ten years by most Members.

6.2	For the past four seasons, IAATO has used a standard protocol to report any high mortality incidents and to avoid the introduction and translocation of alien diseases. 
	
	Both the above-mentioned guidelines have been tabled previously as attachments at ATCM XXIV, ATCM XXV, and in IAATO’s Annual Reports. See Appendix F and G.

7	Reporting of Tourism and Non-governmental Activities and Data Base

7.1	Antarctic tour operators made use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form that was updated and adopted by ATCPs at ATCM XXI and then was revised at ATCM XXIV. Prior to moving ahead on the IAATO data base Members wanted to see how this form worked and if the data would be easily transferred into a database. This worked reasonably well for the 2003-2004 season; however IAATO will probably need to propose modifications to the Post Visit Site Report at ATCM XXVIII to reflect the increased number of activities and in order to “code” activities properly. IAATO encourages the use of the revised form adopted at ATCM XXIV and discontinue the use of outdated reporting forms. The ATCM-approved form can be found on the IAATO web site. New landing sites will be added each year to the drop down menus prior to November 2004. 

7.2	IAATO continues to support the continued use of this single form, which reduces the burden of paperwork and facilitates the study of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourist activities. IAATO would like to encourage Parties to send IAATO and the US National Science Foundation a copy of any forms received from non-IAATO operators in order for the data to be incorporated into IAATO’s “Overview of Tourism” and the new IAATO data base. This will provide for greater transparency of all tourist activities and will further the ability to address cumulative impact issues. IAATO’s data base will be able to access information from these forms and analyze, if necessary, statistics on site visitation. 

7.3	IAATO supports the development of a relevant and effective ATCP-developed tourism data base; however, IAATO would like to note that verifying the information that is put into the data base is extremely important. Regardless of the ATCP data base, IAATO will maintain its own and continue to verify tourism information as has been done the last 13 years. IAATO provided the ATCP Database ICG with a comprehensive list of fields for the programmers to work with, however, additional thought really needs to be considered since maintaining a database is a significant amount of work. At present IAATO will maintain its own database separate to the ATCM’s version.

8	Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1 (Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic and Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic) and Other Guidelines

        8.1 IAATO’s standard operating procedures for implementing Recommendation XVIII-1 include the following: 

    • Mandatory briefings on each tour ship prior to arrival in the Antarctic. This presentation consists of the IAATO slide or PowerPoint presentation. This presentation can be viewed on line at www.iaato.org under “Guidance for Visitors” on the home page. Most expedition leaders will however enhance the presentation with additional slides. 
    • Passengers, ships’ command, crew and expedition staff receive paper copies of Recommendation XVIII-1 “Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic.” Some companies distribute this document in pre-season materials in advance of departure, some on board the ship. In addition to receiving copies of the Recommendation, all passengers and ship’s personnel are required to attend the briefing. 
    • Guidelines are available to Members from IAATO in English, Chinese (Mandarin), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish. Parties might have translated this document into languages not listed above. If so, they are encouraged to submit copies to the IAATO Secretariat for distribution. 
    • Recommendation XVIII-1 does not apply in its entire content to the situation with large ships that conduct a cruise-only operation in Antarctic waters and make no shore landings. In those few instances of large ships, passengers and crew do not receive briefings, although copies of Recommendation XVIII-1 are part of the documents available on board for referral by staff and bridge officers, in particular.
		
8.2	Recommendation XVIII-1, “Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic” is provided to inform Members of key obligations and procedures to be followed.

IAATO is concerned about tourists travelling on non-IAATO operated sailing vessel/yacht operations visiting the Antarctic for the first time who may not be aware of the Environmental Protocol and its obligations. Many of these vessels visit stations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and it would be practical if station leaders were able to raise these issues with sailing vessel/yacht operators.

8.3	In addition, IAATO Members continue to use IAATO and/or company adopted guidelines which include: marine wildlife watching, site specific, kayak, mountain climbing, camping, scuba, helicopter, Zodiac, Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) boot and clothing decontamination and disease protocols.

9	Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning

9.1	At IAATO’s 14th General Meeting the IAATO-Wide Emergency Contingency Plan was agreed upon. This plan was submitted as a separate paper to ATCM XXVI/IP69. The plan was trial-tested during the 2003-2004 season and found to be effective. The plan will be updated prior to the 2004-2005 season. The information on vessels shared amongst Members in the plan is essential for effective response action. 

9.2	IAATO has compiled data on tour vessels’ specifications and other information that would contribute to risk assessment of Antarctic tourism activities. This information was presented at the ATME on Antarctic Shipping Guidelines/Polar Shipping Code held in London in 2000. This list is updated yearly and can be used in coordination with COMNAP if needed.

9.3	Members have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEP) in place on their vessels that satisfy Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL. A “Special Antarctic Addendum” to the SOPEP was developed by IAATO and distributed to Members for implementation and comment in 1998 (ATCM XXII/IP104). While the Addendum has no legal status, it includes notice to contact Antarctic stations in the vicinity of any marine pollution incident, along with appropriate national authorities. 

9.4	The IAATO-wide EMER plan has been in place for at least the past six seasons in order to reduce the need to impact scientific stations in the Antarctic Peninsula with tourism-related medical problems. A standard medical information checklist is available for new Members in order to ensure adequate medical supplies are available on board vessels.

10	Scientific and Information Support 

	Members continue to provide logistic and scientific support to National Antarctic Programs and to the sub-Antarctic Islands, providing a cost-effective resource for the scientific community. During the 2003-2004 season some 152 scientist, support personnel and gear from various National Antarctic Programs were provided transport to and from stations, field sites and gateway ports. In addition a Member assisted Palmer Station in transporting one of their personnel to South America due to a medical condition. A partial list of scientific support is included as Appendix D. Further descriptions are noted below.

10.1	Aurora Expeditions (Australia) continued its contract with Polish Academy of Sciences, re-supplying Arctowski Station and transporting four scientists in November 2003 aboard Polar Pioneer. 

10.2	Quark Expeditions (United States) operating the icebreaker vessel Kapitan Khlebnikov provided the following support:
    • Two scientists were transported to Casey Station from Port Elizabeth,
    • 17 scientists were transported to Macquarie Island plus gear,
    • Nine scientists were transported for New Zealand’s Department of Conservation from Campbell and Enderby Islands to Hobart.

10.3	Golden Fleece Expeditions (Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas-based) worked for four weeks with British Antarctic Survey on an Antarctic krill survey, proving the suitability of small well-equipped sailing vessels for this purpose. In addition, a group of nine passengers sailed on board Golden Fleece to visit South Georgia, South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula with two Members from Vernadskiy to evaluate the feasibility of an Israeli presence in the Antarctic.

10.4	Hapag Lloyd (Germany) transported 30 scientists and support personnel on either Bremen or Hanseatic for the following institutions:
    • Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) to/from Jubany,
    • University of Jena - Institute of Ecology to/from Bellingshausen,
    • Deutsches Zentrum für Luft - und Raumfahrt (DLR) from/to O'Higgins,
    • University of Cambridge,
    • St. Andrews University,
    • Scott Polar Research Institute.

10.5	Heritage Expeditions (New Zealand) operated the vessel Akademik Shokalskiy to assist in the following scientific projects:
    • Deployed four weather buoys for the New Zealand Meteorological Service and transported two meteorological staff to Auckland and Campbell Islands for annual servicing of automatic weather stations,
    • Transported field staff to and from Macquarie Island, Auckland Islands to Bluff and three scientists from Snares Islands to Bluff.

10.6	Peregrine Adventures (Australia) assisted in the following: 
    • Search and rescue operation for eight Korean scientists at Maxwell Bay, King George Island. Akademik Sergey Vavilov remained at the King Sejong Station for 48 hours in difficult conditions. Inflatable boats were utilized for on-going SAR operations,
    • Delivery of approximately 50 metric tons of equipment to Bellingshausen Station,
    • Carrying an international group of 40 scientists from Europe to Antarctica and back to Ushuaia on a dedicated science program. Science and data collecting was done on ocean currents, geology and seabed mapping, 
    • Transporting eight scientists working on the above-mentioned international science program from South America back to Europe.
    • Transporting eight Bulgarian scientists and government representatives to St. Kliment Ochridiski Station, six Bulgarians were transported back to Ushuaia, and 2000 litres of diesel fuel were delivered for station generators.

10.7	Lindblad Expeditions (United States) continued its support of the Oceanites Antarctic Site Inventory Project whose personnel were again provided with accommodations, transport and access to visitor sites aboard Endeavour. In addition, Lindblad provided the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office with numerous “mudmaps” for future incorporation into marine charts.

10.8	Pelagic Expeditions (United Kingdom) sponsored a “Breaking the Ice” voyage for the historic union of Israelis and Palestinians in the Antarctic on board two of their vessels, Pelagic and Pelagic Australis. Most likely for the first time since 1903, Pelagic carried a Swedish team to visit the three historic sites of the 1903 Nordenskjöld Expedition.

10.9  	Society Expeditions (United States) carried three scientists aboard World Discoverer from Jubany to Ushuaia, three Oceanites personnel from Petermann Island to Ushuaia and delivered supplies between the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) to South Georgia. 

10.10  Antarpply (Argentina) had an agreement with the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research (CONCIET) to assist their scientists when possible aboard Ushuaia. 

10.11	Two IAATO Members advised appropriate Parties of the situations at Brown Bluff and Almirante Brown with regard to oil leaking from their respective stations. IAATO is pleased to report that immediate action was taken to rectify the situation at Almirante Brown at least.

10.12	Specific requests for logistic or other support should be made to Members or the IAATO Secretariat. For a complete Membership directory, please refer to the IAATO web site at www.iaato.org.

10.13	Numerous Members update the IHO/IHB yearly with chart information, including chart updates and corrections. IAATO attended the IHO meeting in September 2003. An IHB representative attended the IAATO’s 14th General Meeting (2003). 

11	Conservation Research, Academic and Scientific Support

Members and their passengers continued the tradition of direct financial contributions to many organizations active in Antarctica. Appendix C provides a partial list of donations. 

12	Place Names Update

In the Antarctic Peninsula region a new discovery was made by the officers on the Bremen on February 2, 2003. Omega Island (64º20’S, 62º56’W) in the Melchior Islands group, was thought to be one island but is actually two islands split by a channel of water. The IHO has been sent updated charting information. Member Hapag Lloyd’s personnel provided this information to appropriate authorities and, as of May 2, 2004, the island is now named Bremen Island and belongs to the group of Melchior Islands, Palmer Archipelago, on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. 

13	Observers On Board Member Vessels 

IAATO requires Provisional and Probational Members to carry an observer before they are eligible to apply for Full Membership. During the 2003-2004 season, IAATO appointed nine observers to sail on Provisional Member vessels. IAATO prefers to use a qualified National Program observer from the country in which the company is registered. When not available, IAATO will appoint an appropriate person with broad experience in Antarctic matters. IAATO has a checklist for observers, which has been tabled at ATCM XXIV/IP-XX and ATCM XXV/IP74. In addition, ATCM XIX Resolution 5 (1995) Antarctic Treaty Inspection Checklists is also provided to the appointed observer. A modified checklist is being developed for use by observers on large ships that make no landings in Antarctica. IAATO is aware that any observers appointed by National Programs would not be acting in an official capacity according to Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty, rather National Program representatives. IAATO vessels have been carrying observers since 1991. 

14	Awards and Efforts

Expeditions Inc. was awarded the Condé Nast Traveler Magazine Top Specialist Award for 2003 for Antarctica. 

	ExpeditionTrips Inc. was voted 'Best of the Web' by Forbes Magazine	

Students On Ice was awarded the 2003 Michael J. Smith Award for Science Promotion in Canada. This is an annual award presented by the Canadian Government for groups that have made outstanding contributions to the promotion of science through activities encouraging popular interest in science or developing science abilities. 

Zegrahm Expeditions was recently named by Forbes magazine the "Best Educational Cruise."

Canadian companies Students on Ice and Fathom Expeditions had worked closely with the Canadian Government to encourage the ratification of the Environmental Protocol. IAATO is extremely pleased that Canada has taken this important step.

15	With Thanks -- Cooperation with National Programs

Expedition Leader and Ship’s Officers Seasonal Instructions

TO: 	All IAATO Office Representatives, Antarctic Captains, Expedition Leaders and Radio Officers 
FROM: IAATO
RE:	2003-2004 Season

The following information is included in order to further guide the exchange of information among vessels, and to assist with co-ordination of itineraries and to facilitate the end of season reporting. 

Exchange of Itineraries
    • IAATO Members agree to exchange itineraries and coordinate schedules. This is a key factor in self-regulation, monitoring of activities and also in effective emergency response.
    • Consult the IAATO schedule to determine which vessels will be in your cruising area. Specific landing sites noted on the schedule are given landing priority as agreed to at the IAATO Annual 14th General Meeting, 2003. Expedition Leaders were asked to input day to day itineraries prior to the season. The final IAATO schedule that will be issued in October, 2003 will have landing priorities.  Any other changes or updates after this need to be done directly between the vessels.
    • Itineraries must be communicated between vessels directly and not rely on outside offices once the season begins.
    • Be sure to also exchange environmental information and management recommendations for individual landing sites or other notices with your colleagues as the season progresses.
    • A decision was made at the IAATO Annual 14th Meeting, 2003 to not rely on or use the In.Fue.Tur schedule and use only the IAATO schedule as the primary schedule. This was agreed by the Members and by the Expedition Leaders present at the meeting. 

Itinerary Changes
    • If your final itinerary changes, circulate by GMDSS, Telex by broadcast mode or radio or fax. Confirm during Radio Chat time at 1930.  (Please note that few tour vessels have regular real-time exchange of e-mail.) Since all ships are supposed to be equipped with a GMDSS radio station, they should be able to scan a frequency in the 6310 KZ band (24 hrs). By using broadcast mode (one way) ships can send itineraries, ice information and other information as needed. These transmissions will be picked up by all vessels and should be able to printout the incoming message immediately. 
    • To avoid conflicts, notify vessels in the region of any changes in planned itinerary as soon as practicable. 
    • Notification should be by GMDSS radio telex first then INM-C, fax, telex, VHF or HF (see below).
    • Notify any vessel of intention to cancel a landing. Due to itinerary changes, weather, ice etc another vessel would appreciate having an additional landing option.

Landing Priority
    • In general, priority is given to what is listed on the official IAATO schedule. Landing sites were pre agreed prior to the season and resolved by all companies accordingly.
    • In the event of conflict, expedition leaders should co-ordinate between themselves to determine priority, which is best accomplished through negotiation via HF or VHF. 
    • Please resolve any conflicts equitably. It is assumed that vessels visiting a site with some regularity will give way to a vessel that is not but any number of factors may come into play. 
    • Two vessels are not to land at the same place at the same time and, to avoid any potential environmental impacts, efforts should be made to spread out visits over time.

Station Visits
    • Tour operators have agreed to provide 72 hour-notice to station leaders of any planned station visit.
    • Follow individual procedures determined by national programs/station leaders.
    • Provide timely notice of cancellation, generally 48 hours in advance.
    • Please include any additional station contact information, standard procedures or incidents involving stations, ships or government personnel in your voyage report to the home office.
    • Visits to Palmer Station are not allowed on Sundays and preferably not on Saturdays. All Palmer visits have been prearranged. Any changes, please advise Palmer as soon as possible. There is an official Palmer Station schedule issued each season. Provide Palmer Station with 72 hours notice even though you have a prearranged visit.
    • Visits to British Stations need to be pre-arranged as per instructions by British Antarctic Survey.
    • Port Lockroy: Base A has new site specific Guidelines provided by British Antarctic Survey for visits. Please read these guidelines carefully.

Channel 16
    • Channel 16 is used for hailing purposes only, NOT general communication.
    • After making contact, immediately switch to another channel to continue conversation.
    • Expedition Leaders should periodically review radio etiquette with staff. The airwaves during the height of the season in the Peninsula have been crowded, which is an issue with IAATO Members and potentially with research stations. Take care to follow standard international procedures.

IAATO Radio Schedule 
    • IAATO Members have agreed to implement a once daily radio schedule at 1930.
    • Suggested HF hailing frequencies are: 4146 (1), 6224 (2)-SSB, 8294 (3), to be finalized by radio officers during the season based on experience. Use 6224 whenever possible.
    • Expedition leaders should make use of this schedule whenever VHF communication is impossible for exchange information. This will reduce communication costs.
    • Switch to another frequency for any extended conversation when talking on the above-mentioned HF (4146, 6224).
    • Avoid long conversations over the radio if possible.
    • Protocol for the 1930 chat time: All parties wanting to sort out schedules should make themselves known. Sort all itinerary business first and reschedule any other discussions for a later time. Anyone who simply wants to “chat” should find another time and frequency. ELs not available to talk at this time should appoint another individual to monitor in case a ship is trying to reach you.
    • It is extremely important to not chatter on HF. In years past many EL’s or staff simply did not listen to the chat channel because there were too many lengthy conversations. This channel must be open at 1930 for vessel scheduling and for communication of emergency situations. Again, if you need or want to chat longer, establish a different time and frequency.

Radio Log On, GMDSS Communication
    • Each vessel should report the noon position (Ushuaia local time for the Peninsula Region) to each other via GMDSS radio telex or INM-C. Each radio officer should record this information.  
    • IAATO Radio Log On: At the beginning of the season, ships should use the Radio Log Form and sign off when they have established contact with a specific ship. At the end of the season, the Log should be sent to IAATO together with all the Post Visit Site Reports for evaluation. 
    • GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress Safety System) is the only reliable means of communication and it should be used daily by all ships.
    • Since not all ships are equipped with GMDSS for all coverage, A1, A2, A3 and A4, ships without full coverage can only reliably communicate via INMARSAT-C. Therefore it is important for each ship to pre-establish by what means they will be communicating with each other. The INM-C and the pre-established GMDSS radio telex frequency will allow ships to share information daily. In an emergency, it is the only reliable means of communication. 
    • For additional information reference the agreed IAATO Wide Emergency Contingency Planning Agreement, 14th General Meeting , 2003 and ATCM XXVI Information Paper 69 on Contingency Planning.

EMER (Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response)
    • Review the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan included in your briefing package. 
    • The reporting scheme indicated above is an integral part of emergency response. Please insure that it is followed and report any difficulties to your home office.

Post-Visit Reporting
The Process
    • Following Antarctic Treaty recommendations, complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the standard Post-Visit Site Report for every expedition. The 2003-2004 version of the form should be the ONLY form completed for Antarctica. At the end of each voyage return the form and a computer disc to the home office. It is preferable that the form is emailed to IAATO and US NSF after each trip; however some companies prefer to review the forms first. It is therefore the company’s responsibility to forward the form as soon as possible to IAATO and NSF and not wait until the end of the season.  Email to iaato@iaato.org and to nkennedy@nsf.gov.
    • Always submit a computer version and hard copy of each form. Information gleaned from this form is tabulated and circulated internationally by the National Science Foundation, USA and by IAATO in the form of statistics and input into the tourism database. IAATO recommends that the Ship, individual EL’s and each home office keep copies of each Post Visit Site Report. In.Fue.Tur in Ushuaia also requests a copy of this form in order for them to compile their tourism information.
    • EL’s, please note that this information is used for tourism statistics that are tabled worldwide. Please do not hastily fill this out. If you have questions, consult your home office. 
    • We can not accept hand written forms. All forms must be on typed and on the official EXCEL format. If the form is not compatible with the computers on board ship notify your company representative immediately.
    • Do not wait until the end of the season to send forms to IAATO and NSF and to your national authority. Due to the increased number of vessels during the season we need the reports periodically throughout the season.

The Standard Post Visit Site Report Form
    • The form is in EXCEL Format. Drop down menus have been created to make it easier for all concerned. Spend some time learning how to fill the form out on the computer. The form does not need an original signature. EL’s can type their name directly on the form.
    • Do not include South Georgia landing site information on this form.  There is a separate form for South Georgia.
    • Please note guests of the company, guest lecturers, and other “non-revenue passengers” should be reported as passengers for the purposes of this report unless they have specific staff roles ashore. In general, those responsible for supervising passenger operations ashore that report to the expedition leader are considered staff. Your office will provide additional guidance. Hotel staff, catering, chefs and deckhands are included as crew Members, not staff, unless they are guiding tourists ashore and in Zodiacs.
    • The standard list of “Antarctic Peninsula Region Landing Sites” and any new sites visited during from the 2002-2003 season for Part 2 has been incorporated into the drop down menus. If those sites are not included then please note them as new sites and we’ll add them to the list next year. Please correct duplications or inconsistencies. In general, the most specific place name is used. Most all the landing sites are in the drop down menus. For new sites, type in the name of the site, latitude and longitude at the bottom. It may mean that your list of landing sites will not be in chronological date order. Make additions to the list of landing sites as necessary.  
    • Record one line item per each activity. For example, if at one site you are conducting multiple activities (boat landing, scuba driving, kayaking etc, makes sure each activity is recorded separately).
    • The 2003-2004 form will be completed prior to the start of the season and there will be additional instructions provided by our computer advisor at that time. 

End of Season Reports
    • At the end of the season each company is responsible for providing IAATO with a final report. 
    • Assure that both an electronic copy and hard copy of the Post Visit Site Report Forms are correct and have been sent to IAATO and NSF and your national authority. 
    • Science Assist and Transport: Provide information on the number, nationality of each scientist or group and the destination to where the transport occurred
    • List any donations or funds raised on board for environmental or cultural causes (i.e.  Save the Albatross, Bird Life International, Orca Project, Antarctic Heritage Trust, Scott Polar Research Institute, Allied Whale Campaign etc.)  List to whom it was sent and the dollar, Euro etc amount sent. All this information is incorporated into IAATO’s annual report. For detailed information see ATCM XXVI IP 78, IAATO Annual Report.
    • Report any significant environmental impacts or changes that the officers, expedition staff noticed during the season
    • Report any type of problem with any Non- IAATO Member or Scientific Vessel or their passengers. If digital pictures are available please include. 
    • Submit the required incident report form to IAATO if there had been a problem. 
    • Suggest ways of improving operational logistics and additional methods for minimizing environmental and potential cumulative impacts. 

Have a safe and successful Antarctic season.

Boot and Clothing Decontamination:
IAATO’s Recommended Guidelines


Introduction

While there is at present no conclusive evidence that tourists have introduced or transmitted diseases within Antarctica, there is indirect and circumstantial evidence that raises concern. There is the potential for visitors to be vectors of disease, both into and within the Antarctic ecosystem.

To minimize this potential IAATO recommends decontamination practices similar to those of the quarantine authorities of most countries who protect themselves from the introduction of external diseases.

Recommendations

1.  In pre-voyage information:

1.1  Passengers are advised that Antarctica is an isolated continent and as far as we know is free of introduced diseases.  We must ensure it remains so.

1.2  Passengers are advised that all boots and clothing must be clean before joining the ship.  Those who go trekking, tramping, backpacking, farm visiting prior to the voyage must clean their boots and clothing thoroughly to remove all material from them. Tripod feet can also collect mud and seeds and should be checked regularly.

2.  Pre-landing briefing:

        2.1 Passengers are reminded that they must have clean boots and clothing to go ashore. Facilities will be available on deck for those who need them (the boot washing station).

3.  Landings:

        3.1 As far as possible, avoid walking in concentrations of organic material such as guano, seal placenta, seal faeces, in order to avoid moving this material around the landing site.

        3.2 A simple brush scrubber at the landing site helps to clean boots before entering the Zodiac. The device at the landing site is simply a three-quarter-inch-thick plywood sheet about 2-3 feet square with a couple of stiff-bristle scrub brushes attached, placed so that boots can be placed between them and vigorous brushing cleans the sides of the boot, while a brush on the bottom cleans the sole.  The scrubbers are then thoroughly rinsed at the end of the landing period, and put into the Zodiacs for return to the ship.

        3.3 Before boarding the Zodiac or helicopter, wash as much material off boots and clothing as possible before boarding the Zodiac. Ensure that whatever touched the ground ashore (backpacks in particular), boot cuffs, exposed velcro be inspected, brushed off, etc., before leaving the beach. Seeds and other vegetation in the Sub-Antarctic islands could easily be transported if not cleaned thoroughly.  

        3.4 On returning to the ship, boots and clothing must be cleaned thoroughly at the boot washing station.

4.  The boot washing station:

4.1  This is a facility on deck at the head of the gangway (or in close proximity to the point of return of passengers where Zodiacs or helicopters are used).  It requires:

    • Running water and a hose,
    • Drainage of water off the ship,
    • Scrubbing brush and or coarse mat and shallow tray by which all debris can be scrubbed from boots and clothing,
    • A member of staff or crew to assist passengers to inspect their boots and clothing for complete decontamination.

5.  Between landings:

5.1  Every effort must be made to ensure that boots and clothing dry out completely between landings. (Desiccation is an important mode of controlling some micro-organisms).

6.  At the next pre-landing briefing:

6.1  Ask passengers to check that boots and clothing are clean before leaving the ship.


Appendix G

Introduction and Detection of Diseases in
Antarctic Wildlife: IAATO’s Perspective

Preamble

Inherent in the mandate of IAATO member companies is a long term commitment to environmentally sensitive travel to Antarctica. For a number of years IAATO Members, being mindful of the Environmental Protocol and Recommendation XVIII-1, have used simple precautionary techniques to ensure that foreign material and/or potential pathogens are not introduced into Antarctica by tourists. In the last several years these procedures have been formalized and reviewed by national authorities via Environmental Impact Assessments.

Recognizing that tourists in Antarctica are a highly mobile population and that little is known about the introduction and translocation of alien organisms in the Antarctic, IAATO hopes to play a continuing active role in responding to new information.

Resulting from the Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife workshop hosted by the Australian Antarctic Division (Hobart, October 1998), this document is intended to address the concern about the potential translocation of diseases by tourists in Antarctica, and to suggest a cost effective, practical solution. Given the current lack of scientific data on natural disease status and microbial populations of Antarctic wildlife, and of methods to prevent anthropogenic transmission, a sensible precautionary approach is proposed. 

Antarctic tour operators and staff can be a resource for disease surveillance, reporting and containment. Vessels operated by IAATO Members cover a wide variety of coastal terrain in a short space of time and can provide valuable data to the scientific community on the overall state of wildlife populations.

IAATO Members have continued to make use of boot-washing stations before and after each landing along with a visual check of clothing and gear for any exotic organisms. Following the Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife workshop, IAATO researched a simple effective antiseptic which could be used to limit possible translocation of diseases, such as in penguin feces, when passengers moved from one rookery to another for example. 

We were surprised to find that experts in the field do not agree whether any further action is required beyond simply washing boots and soiled clothing in clean water. A number of researchers suggested that a weak solution of iodine might be a suitable antiseptic. Bearing in mind the variance in opinion amongst experts in the field, IAATO suggests the following:

1. PREVENTATIVE ACTION

*	Prior to their first landing in Antarctica, all passengers receive a comprehensive briefing on Antarctic conservation. An integral part of this briefing is explaining the importance of preventing the possible introduction of foreign materials to Antarctica, and the potential for translocation between Antarctic sites.

*	Before each shore visit passengers and staff are asked to check their clothing for seeds and other extraneous material and scrub their boots in a foot bath on the ship's deck. Given that most voyages depart from Ushuaia and many passengers spend time in Tierra del Fuego before embarkation, the opportunity to transport material to the Antarctic is obvious and a thorough cleaning before the first landing is particularly important.

*	Following each landing for the duration of the voyage, passengers scrub boots at the water's edge prior to boarding Zodiacs and again aboard the ship at the head of the gangway. The foot bath should contain a diluted iodine solution (ratio: three tablespoons of saturated solution to a ten gallon bucket).

*	Disposal of the used iodine solution, which may possibly contain pathogens and is a poison, must be considered. Iodine occurs naturally in the ecosystem and is present in foot bath water in low enough concentrations that it is not considered a threat to the environment. We propose that dirty foot bath water should be disposed into the sea at the place of anchorage at each landing rather than flushed into the ship's tanks. In this way any contaminants acquired at that site will be returned to the waters from which they came, rather than being translocated.

* 	Zodiacs are kept clean between landings and care is taken to remove stones, kelp etc. from the floor of the Zodiac after each landing.

* 	Helicopter skids and passenger compartments are cleaned between landings using clean sea water.

2. PROCEDURES UPON THE DISCOVERY OF A HIGH MORTALITY EVENT

Antarctic tour vessels can potentially act as monitors of the health of wildlife populations, traveling along coastal areas throughout the Antarctic summer. We are not proposing that IAATO vessels take any formal responsibility of monitoring the health of wildlife populations but rather that IAATO instigates a code of practice for responding to a high mortality event.

While acknowledging that high mortality events are open to interpretation in size and cause, the critical issue is that any perceived, highly unusual event be noted and reported appropriately. In the event of discovering a mortality event, tour operators should:

*	Describe and report the event to the nearest scientific station and ships operating in the area. The national authority that the tour organizer provided advance notification should also be notified and an incident report should be prepared for IAATO.

*	In such a scenario, the primary responsibility of the operator is to say that he/she has seen something unusual.

*	Where the operator has reason to believe that landing passengers could lead to translocation of disease or may otherwise be ill-advised, the landing should be aborted.

*	In the event of a landing being made and a mass mortality event not being recognized, then normal boot scrubbing procedures and adherence to approved landing procedures should be enough to minimize the risk of spreading disease.
