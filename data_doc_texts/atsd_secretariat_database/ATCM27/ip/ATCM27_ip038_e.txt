INFORMATION PAPER ON THE ROSS SEA REGION TOURISM SITE INVENTORY PROJECT WORKSHOP





















Information Paper on the Ross Sea Region Tourism Site Inventory Project Workshop

On 26 April 2004 a workshop was held at Antarctica New Zealand to discuss the feasibility of conducting a tourism site inventory in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. The approach has worked well in the Antarctic Peninsula, and could provide a cost-effective method of addressing cumulative impact assessment issues and monitoring for a range of operators in the Ross Sea region (RSR). 37 people attended the workshop at which Ron Naveen of Oceanites gave a presentation on site inventory work in the Antarctic Peninsula, followed by workshop discussion groups.

The key points from the discussion groups are as follows:
    • formalised monitoring of the environmental condition of sites visited by different national programmes, tour operators, and occasional private expeditions needs to be undertaken;
    • all national programmes and tour operators within the Ross Sea region should be involved in the proposed Ross Sea Region Tourism Site Inventory Project;
    • a Principal Investigator role should be established to oversee and co-ordinate the project;
    • a Steering Committee should be formed to make recommendations and co-ordinate the different agencies involved;  
    • a review of all relevant research done in the Ross Sea Region (RSR) should be conducted and baseline information established. It was recognised that there has been much valuable research already conducted in the RSR and this now needs to be collated into a common database; 
    • the sites that tourism operators could contribute data on are those that national programmes have the most difficulty accessing – e.g. Possession Island, Franklin Island, Cape Hallett, and Cape Adare. National programmes could contribute information on sites with easier accessibility e.g. Cape Evans, Cape Royds, Cape Bird and Terra Nova Bay;  
    • a standardised form and methodology should be used to collect data. This form should be similar to forms used by science groups such as RiSCC and the LGP, and should also be part of the State of the Antarctic Environment Reporting system currently being established. Photo-documentation and repetitive photo-documentation should also be undertaken; and
    • data collected should be made available to a widespread audience with the use of compendiums, websites and site guides. It should be recognised that the information collected could be used by a variety of different organisations and institutions.

Given the success of the Antarctic Site Inventory Project in the Peninsula, and subsequent adaptation to other sites, a similar effort for the Ross Sea region is a potentially positive, practical, low-cost initiative. The compilation of site-specific baseline information may also provide a basis for regional and specific site summaries that might then be developed into a Visitors’ Site Guide for the Ross Sea Region. Publication of a Site Guide would enable the initial data collected in the first few seasons of the inventory to be rapidly translated into management of activities at the sites, by making basic information on features and sensitivities easily accessible to visitors. Development of maps and site summaries in clear formats would also support the monitoring programme.
