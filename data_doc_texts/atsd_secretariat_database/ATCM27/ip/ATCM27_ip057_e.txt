CHINESE PROPOSAL AND ACTIVITIES FOR 2007/08 IPY











    1. Objectives

China has formed the national committee for IPY. Mr. Qu Tanzhou, the General Director of CAA, is the chairman. The committee will impulse the concept of IPY accepted by the government and facilitate the Chinese planning in 2007/08.  
   
 China is willing to involve in the 2007-2008 IPY activities and is going to make contributions on the following interested scientific areas. And we welcome international cooperation both in scientific research and logistic support in polar operations. International cooperation will be an important way to promote the better understanding of the role of polar regions in global change through establishing bilateral or multi-lateral scientific program, facilitating share of resources, e.g. cruise, station, lab and data exchange, and convening symposium or workshop.

    2. Activities

(1) Antarctic convergence zone -- Dome A Program (ACDA)
    • establishment of an in-land Chinese scientific research station at East Antarctic Plateau
    • long-term monitoring of atmosphere and glacier along the Zhongshan Station to Dome A
    • Chinese “ITASE” project from Zhongshan Station to Dome A
    • process of the Amery Ice Shelf and its interaction with the ocean 
    • observation of Lambert Glacier and the Amery Ice Shelf system
    • variability of the Southern Ocean and air-sea-ice interaction

(2) Study of the Arctic change and tele-impact on mid-latitudes climate as a part of ISAC
    • Ice-ocean-atmosphere interaction under rapid change of sea ice
    • Influence of Pacific water on Arctic sea ice and water structure
    • Influence of freshwater on sea ice distribution
    • Biogeochemical processes under Arctic rapid change scenario
    • Climatological effect of the Arctic rapid change on mid-latitudes 

(3) Conjugate studies on upper atmospheric phenomena
    • long-term monitoring and observation of bi-polar ionosphere, auroras and magnetospheric boundary layer processes at the Chinese Arctic station and the Antarctic Zhongshan station as a part of SCAR ICESTAR Program
    • study of polar ionospheric and auroral dynamics under the magnetospheric cusp
    • understanding of interactions and couplings among solar wind, ionosphere and magnetosphere
