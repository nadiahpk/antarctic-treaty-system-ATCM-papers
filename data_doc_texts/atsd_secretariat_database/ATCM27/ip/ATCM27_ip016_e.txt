UKRAINE ANTARCTIC RESEARCH PROGRAM (1996-2003)















Ukraine Antarctic Research Program (1996-2003)

(To the notification of Ukrainian interest to achieve Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party status)

Introduction

Ukraine acceded to the Antarctic Treaty on 17 September 1992 in accordance with Article XIII. 

Ukraine has got the status of the Non-Consultative Party of the Antarctic Treaty on 28 October 1992 (Italy) on XVII ATCM in accordance with Article XIII of the Antarctic Treaty. 

Ukraine is a member of CCAMLR since 1994, and since September 5 the same year Ukraine became the associated member of SCAR. 

According to the Memorandum of Understanding between the British Antarctic Survey and the Ukrainian Antarctic Centre (UAC) signed in June 1995, the British Antarctic station Faraday was transferred to Ukraine (now – Akademik Vernadsky Antarctic station). According to Article X of the Antarctic Treaty the Ukraine has provided the complex and systematic research in Antarctica since 6 February 1996. 

At the XXIV ATCM the Depository of Antarctic Treaty confirmed the obtaining of the official documents by Ukraine about the acceding to Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations XVI-10 (Annex V to the Protocol). 

Ukraine has implemented the Protocol rules on legislative and practical level into Ukrainian legislation accordance with the Article 3 and 8 of the Protocol. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine resolution No 908 on "Discharging of the international duties of Ukraine in connection with acceding of the Ukraine to Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty” has been signed June 16, 2003. 

The Cabinet Ministry of Ukraine approved the State Research Program in Antarctica for 2002 –2010 period by the act of 13 September 2001 No 422-r. The law "On Antarctic Activity" was adopted in the first readings by the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of 2 March 2004. 

According to Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty the international inspections in 1999 and 2001 of the Vernadsky station have informed that Ukraine in its Antarctic activity follows the principles and regulations of the Antarctic Treaty System.

The Antarctic activity is one of the parts of the Ukraine strategy on the building up the forth and independent state. The main reason of the Antarctic activity is the scientific research in the field of global climate changes, space weather, and marina resources. Recently the environmental problems have become rather important. The most important principle of the researches is the continuous monitoring of the environment impact of activity in Antarctica. Therefore the most researches are continuous and have round-the-clock all-the-year-round nature. 

The development, approbation and implementation of the new science technologies into the sectors of the national economy, scientific prognoses, energy supply, creating of the space weather conception, communication systems and information transfer, life-support systems in the extreme conditions and creating new informational technologies is other motivating factor of the Antarctic activity. 

The First Ukrainian Antarctic Meeting (1UAM2001) “Five years of the Ukrainian Antarctic researches” was organized and held by UAC and Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine in June 2001 in Kyiv. More then hundred scientists took part in the Meeting, 106 reports by 174 authors (66 oral reports and 44 posters) were received. During 7 sections and plenary meetings 52 reports and 37 posters were presented and discussed. There were representatives of 13 Ukrainian research institutes and 5 universities, National Space Agency of Ukraine, Institute of Earth Magnetism and Radio wave Propagation (Russia), Russian Antarctic Expedition, Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition and others.

The meeting was proposed to determine the priority directions of the researches at the Akademik Vernadsky station and the marine part of the Ukrainian Antarctic Expeditions: (1) “Research of processes of energy distribution from a surface of the Earth up to ionosphere and magnetosphere" and (2) "Research of sea and coastal ecogeosystem changes of the Antarctic Peninsula, and seas of Western Antarctic Region" (Gozhik, 2002). It was recommend: to start at Akademik Vernadsky station the monitoring of anomalies of Radon and condition of pollution the nearby coast; to provide research of local glaciers dynamics of Argentina Islands Archipelago and nearby Antarctic Peninsula region; to make field and laboratory study of process of carry of atmospheric aerosols and impurities of an organic origin, destroying ozone layer, and glacial-chemical researches; study the remote consequences of the work of winterers in Antarctic Region; to pay attention to ethical aspects during realization the medical biological researches. The recommendations were realized by scientists during the Ukrainian Antarctic expeditions at 2001-2002 (Report, 2002).

Since 1997 the Bulletin of the Ukrainian Antarctic Centre has been edited by UAC. This is a scientific magazine where the Ukrainian Antarctic research results are published (Bulletin, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002). In 2003 the Bulletin was renamed as “Ukrainskij Antarctychnyj Zhurnal” (Ukrainian Antarctic Journal).

1. Ukraine Antarctic Research Activity (1996-2003)

The Ukrainian Antarctic Center (UAC) of Ministry Education and Science of Ukraine is the organization appointed to undertake, co-ordinate, and provide the logistics supply of the Antarctic research as the national operator of Ukraine in Antarctica. The UAC coordinates the Antarctic research of number institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and other departments of the state. The eight Ukrainian Antarctic expeditions were organized by the UAC. The fulfillment of ninth is carried out. 

The research activity of the UAC is concentrated on fields: climate change, upper atmosphere and ionosphere physics, biology, solid-Earth geophysics. In this fields the UAC make an efforts to collaborate with National Antarctic Agencies of Poland Republic, United Kingdom, Germany, Bulgaria, United States of America, and countries of South America. The scientific activity of the UAC is in tight cooperation with Radio Astronomy Institute, Geophysical Institute, Institute of Geology Sciences, Lviv Center of Space Research Institute (Kyiv National Tarasa Shevchenka University, Odessa Ecology University) and other organizations of Ukraine. 

At the Ukrainian Antarctic station Akademik Vernadsky (65º15'S, 64º16'W) the researches in upper atmosphere and earth magnetic field, observations on total ozone, measurements of the ocean level changes, fundamental meteorological parameters changes observations, biology, glaciology, human biology and medicine, and ecology are carried out by Ukrainian scientists. 

The surface meteorology observations, total ozone and tide measurements, ionosphere soundings, geomagnetic field registration, UV-B observation, EM-radiation observations in VLF, ELF, HF bands (whistlers, Schumann and Alfven resonance, geomagnetic micro pulsations, TID), seismic-acoustic measurements are carried out continuously (Milinevsky, 1998). From 6 to 9 scientists work at the station during winter. Six technicians provide the station operation. From 15 to 20 scientists perform seasonal researches in the field of upper atmosphere physics, solid Earth physics (Didenko, 2001), glaciology, atmosphere physics and chemistry, oceanography, marina biology at the Vernadsky station and Antarctic Peninsula region during season (Abstracts, 2001). 

The new equipments have been developed at the station recently: 
    • high sensitive magnetometers were installed for magnetosphere parameters, Schumann resonance and Alfven resonance research,
    • the seismic acoustic devices were mounted, 
    • the variation of UV-B radiation measurement was started,
    • the human biology and medicine research project was developed using new equipment: rythmograph, reflotron, Holter sensors, 
    • the winterers organisms ecology state monitoring was provided using XRF analysis method of hair and radioactivity body monitoring ,
    • the hydrology measurements was developed.

The State program of Ukrainian researches in Antarctica for 2002–2010 yrs defined the strategy of Ukraine activity in Antarctic region for development and support of social-economic, ecologic, scientific and technical, national culture and other activity (Program, 2001). The program consist of the research projects in Antarctica and foreseen the development of new technology (Article IX of Antarctic Agreement). The prospects research programs are discussed and approved by the Research Council “Antarctica” established in 1999 under supervising of Ministry Education and Sciences of Ukraine.

Upper Atmosphere and Geospace Physics

Historically the Faraday base (then Akademik Vernadsky station) is well-equipped observatory for upper atmosphere research. The ionosphere and geospace research started by British scientists are well developed now. 

The main topic of the upper atmosphere research at Ukrainian Vernadsky Antarctic Station is the study of energy transfer of natural and man-caused disturbances from the surface of the Earth to geospace height (Abstract, 2001; Ivchenko, 2002; Zaitsev, 2000) according the priority field of research. The new methods of remote sensing radiosounding of geospace are under development.

During 2002-2003 Antarctic summer season the automatic electromagnetic measurement devices were installed and put into operation. They include two (main and reserve) low-noise three-component flux-gate magnetometers. The base line of the main magnetometer during two years suits excellent to intermagnet standards and the reserve magnetometer has extremely low noise level – less than 5 pT at 1 Hz. Other magnetic sensors – ELF receivers - consist of two orthogonal search-coil magnetometers covering frequency band from 0,1 to 300 Hz with extremely low noise level in this band – less than 0,03 pT/ at 10 Hz. The system has also two orthogonal electric lines with Cu-CuSO4 no polarized electrodes. All these sensors are coupled to the automated data collection system, which is organized on the base of PC lab card and computer with corresponding software and large memory volume for data archive. The output data of the main flux-gate magnetometer are also transmitted once per 1 minute via GOES-E satellite to WDC in Canada (Korepanov, 2003).

The systematic researches of the interconnection processes in the different regions of the near-earth area from the neutral atmosphere to the ionosphere heights are held on the Vernadsky station (Yampolski, 2000; Milinevsky, 2002). The three-positional Doppler HF-receiver and ionosonde control the upper part of ionosphere dynamics and structure. The multi channel HF-receiver gives possibility to reconstruct and visualize the TID propagated up to height of F-region. The systematic observations and analysis of Vernadsky data give possibility to study a number of large-scale disturbances in еру atmosphere: (1) to trace the excitation of AGW transfer from the surface of the Earth to ionosphere heights; to monitor the dynamics of global thunderstorm activity and to trace the thunderstorm intensity in main equatorial centres; (2) to monitor the possible electromagnetic pollution in Antarctica is the one of the topics of research; (3) to study the ionosphere Alfven resonator peculiarities; (4) to provide the comparative analysis of long-term magnetic observations with ozone, weather, ionosphere and tide data (Yampolski, 2000а).

The geomagnetic data from Vernadsky have been sent to INTERMAGNET network via satellite. The regular ionosphere sounding is provided using digitized ionosonde ISP-42 (Report, 2002; Milinevsky, 1998). The geomagnetic micropulsations polarization characteristics measurements are carried out for diurnal and season parameter variations study controlled by sources peculiarities and lower ionosphere conductivity (Yampolski, 2001; Yampolski, 1997; Yampolski, 2000b). The Schumann resonance ELF observations are conducted as well. 

The unified set of measurements of the electromagnetic noise level in ELF, VLF, HX bands in order is performed to provide comparative analysis of the Northern hemisphere man-made sources influence upon “Antarctic electromagnetic climate” (Yampolski, 2002).

The resonance Earth magnetic field variations and their relations with the transversal lower ionosphere conductivity in conjugate regions Vernadsky station – Boston region (in collaboration with USA scientists of AFRL, Haystack Observatory, Lowell University) are studied. The Alfven ionosphere resonance oscillations and EM-fields nonlinear interaction effects with near-earth plasma are investigated. The search of the quasi-periodical height electron density profile variations during the AGW propagation close to Earth surface is executed (Yampolski, 2002).

The search of the signs of energy transfer of the long-period oscillations from the troposphere to the ionosphere heights via ozone layer based on the Vernadsky Antarctic station meteorological, magnetic, total ozone and ionosphere data was made. The prospecting research of SAR-arcs with the photometer installed at Vernadsky station has been recently started (Ivchenko, 2002).

The ionosphere research with the purpose of determination of ionosphere effects called by geomagnetic activity, perturbations of a various type in magnetic conjugate region, and revealing of possible effect of seismic activity on condition of the ionosphere above station was provided.

The magnetosphere study based on simultaneous observations of the geomagnetic field (micro pulsations) at Vernadsky and British Antarctic Survey (UK) magnetometers is provided (Clilverd, 2003). The magnetometers data were processed to determine the inner magnetosphere plasma density using the cross-phase technique of paired magnetometers response to pulsations (Korepanov, 2003).

The three-component geomagnetic field registration is continuously carried out to control daily field trends (Milinevsky, 1998). The 3-hours indices every month are sending to International Service of geomagnetic indices (France).

The effect of parameter changes in the solar wind and solar activity in the ionosphere of high geographical latitudes and average geomagnetic latitudes is studied. The study of features of geomagnetic variations in Antarctic Region and influence of magnetic and ionosphere processes in system a magnetosphere - ionosphere - atmosphere, relations between magnetic variations, dynamics ozone layer and other atmospheric parameters will be conducted. 

Atmosphere Physics and Chemistry 

The total ozone measurement is provided the valuate row data obtained before by British scientists (Lambert, 2000). The topics of research are: (1) the search of interrelation of the total ozone and meteorological processes and possible processes in the ionosphere, (2) the study of biologically active ultraviolet radiation using the bio-dosimeter on the basis of transformations of vitamin D (Terenetskaya, 2002; Kravchenko, 2000; Milinevsky, 2001a, 2001b).

The long-term variations study of the atmosphere ozone-depleting organic halides, hydrocarbons in the Antarctic ice and snow samples from glaciers dated from pre-industrial Holocene to nowadays in comparison of their content to up-to-date snow and sea water samples (Bogillo, 2002, 2001, 2002a, 1998, 2001a; Bazylevska, 2002, 2002a; Pokrovskyj, 1999) was carried out last years.

The measurements of the atmosphere Radon concentration and gamma-background using solid-state detectors were started in 2002.


Meteorology, Hydrology, Climate

The main objective of this field research is study of the long-term climate changes. The complete meteorological observations on the base of standard program of the World Meteorological organization using the modular automatic weather station (MAWS) are executed. The sea tide observations are performed using the mechanic tide gauge and the automatic gauge. The monthly mean weather parameters and CLIMAT data are prepared for WMO and Hydrometeorology Service of Ukraine. The rainfall sampling for MAGATE performs and samples sent to Austria.

The project is performed to determine the local wind circulation peculiarities. Investigations of in sea ice characteristics changes - its thickness, duration of steady winter ice cover characteristics, number and size of icebergs and fields of broken ice in Vernadsky region are carried out (Bulgakov, 2000). The atmosphere turbidity is measured, the interactions between ozone layer and synoptic situation in the region are studied. Hydrological researches on the Academician Vernadsky station was started in 2002 using the Oxy and salinity measuring equipment, bathometers and sea current velocity measuring instruments for providing of hydro chemical and dynamical monitoring of the Argentine Island region (Govorukha, 1998, 1998a).

The search of causes of the changes in the hydrological and hydro chemical processes formation nearby the Vernadsky station is fulfilled. The permanent registration of the temperature, salinity and oxygen concentration in the top layer of water, the measurement of the vertical distribution of temperature, salinity, alkalinity, oxygen concentration are realized.

The meteorology and hydrology anomaly formation in the Antarctic Peninsula region is studied. The meteorology anomaly number is rised last years. That could be consequence of global warming. We explore the response of local ecosystem on the meteorology anomaly (Pirnach, 1994; Krakovskaia, 1998, 2000, 2002). The hydrometeo anomaly event data bank is created. Hydrology research at Vernadsky is provided for hydrochemical and dynamical monitoring Argentina Island shelter water area. 

Glaciology 

The main topic of research is the study of the ice caps and glaciers dynamics and mass-balance of Argentina Island archipelago and Antarctic Peninsula (in the Vernadsky Station region). The glaciology observations in Argentina Islands archipelago region were renewed. The digital photogrammetric geodesy survey technology was introduced for (Milinevsky, 2003). 

The continuous geomorphology survey of the ice caps of the small islands in Antarctic Peninsula region using GIS technology have been recently started. The changes of the size, the shape and the edge position of ice caps on Argentina Island archipelago shows the possibility to use the geodetic survey data of the caps to study the regional climate variability (Glotov, 2003).

The avalanching investigation and drift snow measurements, snow survey, digging a prospect-hole, snow and ice samplings are provided during season works (Beliavsky, 2000, 2002).

Geodesy 

In the framework of the geodesy cartography program the geodesy survey technology for Argentina Island region was developed to provide the GIS project "Vernadsky-Argentina Islands" introduced for the region of the Vernadsky station and adjacent territory of Antarctic Peninsula (Greku, 2000, 2000a, 2000b, 2001, 2001a; Gozhik, 2000, 2002; Glotov, 2003; Milinevsky, 2003).

Season permanent GPS-survey at the “SCAR GPS 2002” site on Galindez Island within the framework of the GIANT project was started at Vernadsky in 2002. The GPS observations are carried out at the “SCAR GPS 2002” site for 15 days in 2002 and 2003, the error of coordinates in 2002 is 1-2 mm; the data of 2003 are processed (Greku, 2003). More than 300 GPS points had determined for positioning of different geophysical measurements on islands. 

The program of the GIS development for the Argentina Island archipelago and adjacent Antarctic Peninsula region (GIS project "Vernadsky-Argentina Islands") has been recently started. The main objectives of the project are:· The high precision network creation of the geodesic stations in the vicinity of Ukrainian Antarctic Vernadsky station on the base GPS-positioning data. The large-scale digital maps (1:25,000) development of the Argentina Islands region (including Petermann Island, Berthelot Island, adjacent Antarctic Peninsula area).·The hidden regularities and anomalous events in combined system land-ice-ocean-atmosphere-ionosphere retrieval. There are three stages of GIS development corresponded to the objectives. The software installation and development, data layers composing: geomorphology, ecology, glaciations, birds and plants, geology. Within 2001/2002 season high precision coordinates of geodetic survey marks were measured and local geodetic network was created on Galindez Island. The bathymetry map of the Argentina Islands archipelago was obtained on the GIS technology framework. On the base the photogrammetric survey the large-scale digital map (1:1,000) of the Marina Point of Galindez Island was created. 

Galindez ice cap and Antarctic Peninsula ice streams mapping with the ERS radar interferometer were made (Greku, 2000a, 200b). Echo sounding of the Argentine archipelago’s seabed in the shallow unsurveyed area (within the framework of the IBCSO project) has been provided in the Vernadsky Ukrainian Antarctic station region since 1997 (Gozhik, 2000, 2002). Determination of detailed local geoids with the altimeter data of the Bellinsgausen sea (within the framework of the project ANTEC) was carried out (Greku 2001a) in collaboration with Institute of Geology Sciences.

The high precision GPS observations at Vernadsky and SCAR-2002 site were provided in cooperation with scientists of Geodaetisches Institut Universitaet Karlsruhe (Germany) – the continuation of the Antarctic plate movement research according the Geodetic Infrastructure of Antarctica SCAR Program (GAP96, GAP98, SCAR2002).

Biology (Ornithology) 

Research of the adaptation features of separate species is carried out. The research objectives area: (1) the determination specifically and quantitative structure nested and migratory birds, phenology of the basic biological objects; (2) study of the population characteristic distinctions and nested life observation to determine features between species and inside species relations using the birds ringing. 

Research and monitoring of the marine mammals and birds population condition in region of the Vernadsky station, an estimation of number of the basic groups of the species in dynamics and account of volume of consumption by them a krill in region of archipelago the Argentina Islands, study seasonal, in-between-seasonal population with the purpose of making a databank morphological and phenotypic signs are fulfilled.

We provide the seasonal estimation of population of Antarctic krill in the Argentina Islands region, krill population genetic monitoring, analysis of krill population genetic structure and their dynamics. The genetic basis of stability of the krill development and adaptation and research of genetic structure of krill population using the modern methods of biochemical genetics for an estimation of dynamics their genofund and forming of the units of a stock are provided in collaboration with Kiev National Taras Shevchenko University (Bezrukov, 1998, 2002). 

In the framework of the project “Fauna of parasites of the Antarctic fishes (taxonomy, phylogeny, and seasonal dynamics)” the research Antarctic fish peculiarities are provided in the current winter (Utevsky, 1996; Epshtein, 1996, 1996a). The species composition, taxonomy, and host-parasite relationships of Antarctic leeches are important biological issues both in fundamental and in commercial concern. Results of the study will include the list of species of Antarctic leeches and other parasites, revision of the taxonomic positions of a series of species and genera, discovery of the phylogeny of fish leeches and determination of ecological factors that caused the evolution of this group.

Geology and Solid Earth Geophysics 

The project of “Region-scale geological investigation of the subglacial terrains of Antarctica: main rock types identification and terrain-scale geological/metallogenic events determination on a basis of single-grain trace element geochemistry of wide-spread accessory minerals from marine glacial deposits” was developed (Shnyukov, 1997, 1997a, 2002, 2002a). The standard procedures for regional geological/metallogenic investigations and crustal evolution determination are inapplicable within this subglacial region. Comparable results may be derived from single-grain trace element geochemistry of zircon (monazite, apatite etc.) large detrital populations from marine glacial sediments of Antarctic continental shelf that reflect provenance (age and composition of rock types widely distributed within the drained subglacial area). 

In geology research of determination tensely-strained composition of Antarctic Peninsula mountain ridges and adjusted islands the new results on geodynamical reconstruction Argentina Island territory and paleotectonic reconstruction of the Antarctic Peninsula West part in Neozoic age were obtained (Bakhmutov, 2001, 2002). 

The periodic magnetic surveys are made during every summer season. The magnetic profiling with vector and scalar magnetometers recently has been accomplished. The unexpected information about the crust deep structure in the station region was received from the first magnetotelluric, tectonomagnetic and magnetovariational measurements. The modern processing code was produced to develop the geomagnetic and magnetotelluric data (Korepanov, 2003).

The tectonomagnetic investigations in the station region began in 1998. They were aimed at the Earth crust recent tectonic activity monitoring. Three cycles of repeat observations were carried out from 1998 up to 2002, along tectonomagnetic profile which crosses from west to east the main tectonic elements of Argentina Island archipelago. The zone of anomalous magnetic field dynamic variations (‑ 3.5 nT/year) has been detected. On the base of the numerical simulation using the rock magnetic properties experimental data it has been concluded that these temporal variations were caused mostly by the piezomagnetic effect under the influence of tensile stress of sub latitude stretch (Cherepova, 1999; Korepanov, 2003).

According the project “Seismic activity and tectonic conditions research of Antarctic Peninsula region” provides the accumulation of the experimental data for the seismic and acoustic (infrasound) monitoring used for the realization of the researches of general seismic activity in the Antarctic region, study tectonics in region, realization of the global seismic activity supervision, of the icebergs formation and infrasound phenomena monitoring connected to various natural sources of the meteorological origin are fulfilled.

Human Biology and Medicine

The study of the human adaptation to the Antarctic conditions and investigation of geophysical factor of influences on human health (geomagnetic activity, meteorology perturbations, variability of UV-B radiation) are carried out at Vernadsky station. Investigation of the high nervous activities change dynamics in the wintertime, dynamics of state the cardio-lung, nervous, immune and antioxidant people system at the period of Antarctic station conditions. It is being studied the correlations between meteo- and geophysical parameters and genome stability, morbidity and capacity for work of winterers.

The selection of the statistical data of the winterer sickness, accessory phenomena of station personnel were provided regularly. 

Research of the influence of the geophysical factors (ionosphere, geomagnetic, weather disturbances, fluctuating of a flow UV-B radiation on the human health on the basis of the general analysis of temporary variations of a heart rhythm and variations of geophysical parameters in Northern (Kola Peninsula) and Southern (Vernadsky Station) regions. 

The results of winterer medical survey shown that on starting adaptation period a few serious deviation in the health and the organism functional state. However the enlarged numbers of the «non-stationary» and metastable organism states are registered. Then the transition to disease and quasi-disease state is possible (Iljin, 2000, 2001, 2001a; Bezrukov, 2002).

The examinations of overlays of breathe system, circulation of the blood and the physical work ability capacity of the participants of expedition. The condition cardio-respiratory dynamics, nervous, immune and antioxidant systems breath reaction, the blood circulation, gas circulatory systems of the winterers organism on effect of the particular Antarctic factors, such, as breath in conditions of a hypoxia are studied.

Study of processes of a reducing of radioactive contamination of the human organism of the person during winter at the Vernadsky in conditions of the lowest Antarctic contaminated environment is provided.

Marina Biology 

The marina expeditions onboard R/V Ernst Krenkel and R/V Gorizont have been organized by the UAC in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002 yrs. The study of state and changes West Antarctica, Antarctic Peninsula seaside region, the study of Antarctic krill population (Euphausia superba Dana) and other main pelagic component of South-Orkney sub-region Scotia Sea and Bransfield Straight (Bezrukov, 1998; Samyshev, 2001, 2002) are made during expeditions.

Research in genetics has been made in the fields: (1) the analysis of krill population genetic structure and their dynamics based on the methods biochemical genetics; (2) genetic basis of stability development and krill adaptation. 

During the 2001/2002 season it was established that krill stock in the region of traditional fishery – Scotia Sea (nearby Coronation Is.) reduced (in comparison to 1998 season research) in 6 times (Samyshev, 2002). The ecosystem state evaluation was received from simultaneous biology and oceanography observations in Bransfield Straight. The seasonal estimation of population of Antarctic krill in the Argentina islands region is carried out. Scientific purposes of research are: studying of composition distribution and productivity of phytoplankton, visual calculation of bird and mammal quantity that are fed the krill, selection of phyto- and bacterio- planktons samples zoo flagellates and infusorians, and their composition study, observations of forms and quantity of birds and mammals (whale, seals) in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

Oceanography

Correlation between hydrodynamic, hydrophysic and hydrochemistry processes, their dependence on atmosphere processes changes and regional conditions are studied during marina expeditions. Studying of the hydrometeorology conditions on biology productive zones forming, the structure and variability of oceanographic fields in Atlantic sector of Antarctic, research of dynamic role and “iciness“ in resources potential formation are provided (Artamonov, 2001).

Working out and adaptation to regional conditions the models of hydrographic processes and diagnostic methods of state and forecasting the evolution of oceanographic fields, the methods of satellite monitoring and drift technology; study the structure and dynamics of water, ice variability; discovery of climate characteristics, ocean field peculiarities that develop an biologic productivity and business significance are fulfilled in cooperation with Marina Hydrology Institute (Artamonov, 1998; Greku, 2000).

Establishment of correlation in hydro optic characteristics, biology, and hydrology parameters, study of anthropogenic influences in the station region on hydro optic characteristics of adjacent water are fulfilled (Bulgakov, 2000). 

The complex of experimental works in the fields of marina biology, oceanology, hydro-chemistry, industrial and acoustic oceanography were proposed. Most interesting directions of explorations are: krill, salpas, zooplankton and other factor of environment in the zones of high biological activity (the Patagonia shelf and shelf of the East Cost of Argentina, Scotia Sea. The research topics are: estimation of krill capacity in regions of industrial fishing, dynamics and structure of waters in that regions, explorations of the fronts and large-scale sea currents as factors of creation of the fields increased biological activity, the investigation of typical season changes of wind field over South-West Atlantic and correspondent changes in circulation of the waters for different seasons, investigation of acoustic properties of polar marina media (Artamonov, 1998).

Ecology, environment monitoring

The investigations of global contamination of Earth atmosphere extend and estimation of genetic risks of a little doze of ionize influence was started in Antarctica conditions. It is planned to investigate the smooth dynamic of global Earth atmosphere contamination, to define the present natural standard of “pure” air in different regions of Ukraine. The research of the connection between contamination level in penguin feather and purities of micro nuclide frequency in blood red corpuscles as an index of genome stability was started.

In the purpose of estimation of Antarctic station activity influence on environment pollution the monitoring of Galindez Island ecosystem was installed. Selection and conservation the moss and lichen samples to the purpose of searching in them contaminants. Collection of samples for definition of quantity concentration the oil-products and toxically substances in seawater near the station. Searching of contamination level by domestic wastes in the seawater of nearest sea. 

The study of the influence of growing tourists activity on the Vernadsky station region and adjacent territory of islands are discussed.

Optimization of the vegetable waste treatment biotechnology using the microbial metabolism regulators at Vernadsky is under development. 

The new project “The ecology - geochemical monitoring of the Vernadsky station region” has been recently started in 2003 (Andreev, 2003). Environmental monitoring of the Vernadsky area gives a special approach, which is to provide for finding low technogenic anomalies and for effective their identification in a background of mostly lithologic natural geochemical anomalies. It is suggested to apply research (exploration) methodology for low technogenic geochemical anomalies in the conditions of changed lithologic origin of sediments (soil) composition (Shnyukov, 2001; Andreev, 1992). 

The moss, lichen, penguin guano and feather, algae, peat samples, eggshells were chosen for monitoring Vernadsky Antarctic station environment. The samples for the eco-geochemical monitoring joint project of UAC and KNU were collected in Antarctica. The Cu, Zn, Pb content data using XRF-analysis of samples after preparation and pre treatment was obtained. The data are variable in wide range and can’t be used for the regional environmental condition evaluation and tracking dynamics. Therefore the environmental monitoring of the man-caused geochemical anomalies has to consider mineral contamination of biogenic samples. Lithologic factor influence on the level of geochemical background should be eliminated by instrumental quantitative determination of micro- and macro elements in the sediments (Andreev, 2003).

The main tasks of this laboratory are: 1) new distance radiophysics methods of the ionosphere and magnetosphere diagnostic in Antarctica; new high sensitive HF, VLF, ULF-receivers for the monitoring of the electromagnetic surroundings in Antarctica; the visualization space weather parameters above Antarctica, 2) the researches of the physical mechanisms of the natural and artificial energy disturbance transportation from surface to Upper Atmosphere; the global natural resonance systems and its artificial disturbance, the transfer of the energy from northern hemisphere to southern hemisphere. Dr. Yu.Yampolsky is the head of this laboratory. 

The joint laboratory “Medical-biological and ecological problems in Antarctica” was created between UAC and Institute of Labor Medicine of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. The main tasks are the exploration of the adaptation processes, the state of human cardiovascular system in the inversion season conditions and changes of time zone. Dr. E. Moiseenko and Dr. V. Iljin coordinate the activity of this laboratory. 

The joint laboratory “The informational support of the Antarctic researches and expeditions” between UAC and National Aviation University was created for the informational support of the Antarctic expeditions and the realization of the State program projects. Dr. V. Kuzovik is responsible for the carry out the laboratory.

The Training Base for the winterer training was founded by UAC and Institute Radio Astronomy (Kharkov) in 2001. This Base was founded for the training of the candidates-winterers for the Ukrainian Antarctic Expedition. Three training courses for future winterers were fulfilled in 2000-2002 years.

The UAC has permanent contacts and collaborated with the several other institutes to provide the temporal (1-2 years) research projects. There are Institute of South Sea Biology (Sevastopol), Odessa State Ecology University, Ukrainian Center Sea Ecology (Odessa), National Nature Museum (Kyiv), Institute of Microbiology and Virusology (Kyiv), National University “Lvivska Politekhnica” (Lviv), Sea Hydrology Institute (Sevastopol), Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute (Kyiv).
