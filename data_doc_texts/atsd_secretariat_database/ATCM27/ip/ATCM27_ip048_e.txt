INSPECTION ОF RUSSIAN ANTARCTIC STATIONS AND BASES

On the instructions of the Government of the Russian Federation during the period November 2003 to February 2004, the inspection of the Russian Antarctic stations and bases was carried out by the representatives of the interested bodies of the federal executive power of the Russian Federation. 
The inspection was made in two stages. At the first stage, the participants of the inspection group onboard the RV “Akademik Fedorov” during its Antarctic cruise from December 10, 2003 to February 16, 2004 inspected Mirny and Progress stations and Druzhnaya-4 and Molodezhnaya Bases. At the second stage, the inspection group flew to the Antarctic onboard aircraft Il-76 TD from Cape Town (SA) to the airfield of Novolazarevskaya station (6 February 2004), inspected Novolazarevskaya station (6 – 8 February 2004), and was also acquainted with the operation of the neighboring foreign Maitri (India), Sanae-IV (South Africa)  and Troll (Norway) stations. 
The Inspection group checked the Russian stations and bases with respect to the:
- conduct of scientific observations and studies, 
               - state of the technical facilities for conducting scientific observations,
- state of  the infrastructure objects of the stations and transport vehicles;
               - practical activity of the Russian Antarctic stations and field bases concerning fulfillment of the provisions of  the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, 
The inspection served as a basis for working out the proposals and recommendations for optimization of the activity of the Russian stations in the Antarctic, in particular:
1. Main functions of all operating Russian Antarctic stations and bases for the nearest years were determined:  
    • Mirny Observatory -  observation base on the baseline environmental monitoring (decrease of the infrastructure, removal of the base of transport traverses, conduct of comprehensive nature protection operations), conduct of monitoring at the site of special scientific interest – Haswell Island;
    • Progress station – center of RAE transport and expedition operations, base of inland traverses and an airfield;
    • Vostok station – base of basic studies in the central Antarctica and an airfield;
    • Novolazarevskaya station – base for monitoring and field scientific studies and an airfield;
    • Bellingshausen station – regional center for studies in the marginal regions of the Antarctic,
2. Regarding the earlier suspended USSR stations and bases: Russkaya, Leningradskaya, Molodezhnaya and Bunger Oasis, it was decided to develop a special program for their use and conduct of necessary nature protection activities.  
            3.  The Inspection group recommended to:
                 - give priority attention to fulfillment of scientific studies and projects envisaged in the Federal Program “World Ocean” taking into account the orientation to the objectives of the International Polar Year 2007-08, 
- expand the aviation support of RAE operations for which to construct the snow-ice airfields at Progress and Vostok stations and continue development of the airfield at Novolazarevskaya station,
- pay special attention to the issues of environmental protection, including waste removal and equipping the stations with necessary nature protection technological equipment.
            4. The inspection group recommended undertaking during the next few years measures for upgrading the infrastructure of RAE stations in order to improve safety of their operation and support for the priority scientific studies and also to proceed to the design and construction of the new research-expedition vessel for the Russian Antarctic Expedition.
