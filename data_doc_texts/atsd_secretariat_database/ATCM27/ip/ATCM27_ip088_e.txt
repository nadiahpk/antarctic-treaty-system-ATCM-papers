A REVIEW OF THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF
ANTARCTIC MAMMALS AND BIRDS



I.   Introduction

Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty deals with the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora.  With regard to species that deserve special protection, the Annex provides for the designation of Specially Protected Species.  These species are listed at Appendix A to Annex II.  In 2000, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties initiated a revision process of the regime of Specially Protected Species.  The revision aims at reviewing the current list of specially protected species, identifying criteria for selecting species for inclusion in the list, and proposing practical mechanisms for providing the required level of extra protection. 

This report reviews the conservation status of mammals and bird species occurring in the Antarctic Treaty area with the view to help the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in the revision process of the regime of Specially Protected Species.
 
The report focuses specifically on 1) the state of conservation of Antarctic mammals and birds based on the IUCN – The World Conservation Union’s Red List and assessments made by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research; and 2) the protection status afforded to Antarctic mammals and birds under the Antarctic Treaty system and other relevant multilateral environmental agreements.    

UNEP decided to undertake this study in view of its mandate to further the collaboration among multilateral environmental agreements, in particular those of which it administers the secretariat, as well as part of its mandate to review the Marine Mammal Action Plan through a greater coordinated effort.



II.  METHODOLOGY

This report includes mammal and bird species indigenous to the Antarctic Treaty area or occurring there seasonally through natural migrations.  The Antarctic Treaty area is defined in Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty as the area south of 60° South Latitude. Mammal species include cetaceans  (whales and dolphins) and seals.  Although whales are primarily dealt with by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, they are included in this report to provide a more complete overview of the conservation status of Antarctic mammals.  Whale, dolphin, seal and bird species were selected based on whether or not their range covers any part of the Antarctic Treaty area. The ranges were determined on the basis of the “Complete Guide to Antarctic Wildlife” (Shirihai, 2002) and information made available on-line.  As the ranges of some species are not precisely known, it could be that they are erroneously listed in this report, whilst others are omitted.   

Multilateral environmental agreements outside the Antarctic Treaty system pertaining to the conservation of Antarctic wildlife were identified using ECOLEX1.  They include the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), and the 2001 Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP).  The main objectives of the multilateral environmental agreements referred to in this paper are given in Attachment I.

To avoid inaccuracies, the report was sent for comments to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), as well as to the secretariats of the multilateral environmental agreements mentioned above.  We are very grateful to SCAR and the secretariats of ICRW, CITES and CMS, as well as the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity for their comments and suggestions.



III.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Three main tables containing information on the conservation and protection status of Antarctic wildlife were developed.  They are:

    • Antarctic mammals – cetaceans: Attachment II
    • Antarctic mammals – seals: Attachment III
    • Antarctic birds: Attachment IV

In addition, a fourth table providing information on the status of ratification of the conventions referred to in Attachment II to IV by the Antarctic Treaty Parties is given in Attachment V.


Antarctic mammals

Among the cetacean species (see Attachment II) occurring in the Antarctic Treaty area:
        ◦ Three are endangered (Blue, Fin and Sei whales);
        ◦ Two are vulnerable (Humpback and Sperm whales);
        ◦ Five are lower risk / conservation dependent (Antarctic Minke, Southern Right, Arnoux’s Beaked, Southern Bottlenose and Killer whales);
        ◦ One is lower risk / near threatened (Dwarf Minke Whale);
        ◦ Two are lower risk / least concern (Pygmy Right and Long-finned Pilot whales); and,
        ◦ Four are data deficient (Andrew’s Beaked, Gray’s Beaked, Hector’s Beaked and Strap-toothed whales).

Commercial whaling in the Antarctic Treaty area is forbidden under the International Whaling Commission (IWC), while the IWC places no restrictions on lethal research under special permits (“scientific whaling”) which member countries may grant to their nationals regardless of the conservation status of the target species.  Endangered / vulnerable whale species are listed at CITES Appendix I and CMS Appendix I.  All other whale species are listed at CITES Appendix II.

Two (Southern Right Whale Dolphin and Spectacled Porpoise) of the three dolphin / porpoise species occurring in the Antarctic Treaty area are data deficient, whilst the third one (Hourglass Dolphin) is lower risk / least concern.  All three are listed at CITES Appendix II.  In addition the Spectacled Porpoise is listed at CMS Appendix II.

All seals species (see Attachment III) occurring in the Antarctic Treaty area are assessed in the IUCN Red List as lower Risk.  This means that none of these species satisfies the criteria for endangered or vulnerable. In addition they are all classified as least concern, meaning that their status is not conservation dependent or near threatened.  
 
Nevertheless, all Fur Seal species and the Ross Seal have been given the status of Specially Protected Species under Annex II of the Madrid Protocol.  In addition all seal species but one (Southern Sea Lion) are given partial or full protection status under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.  All fur seal species and the Southern Elephant Seal are listed in CITES Appendix II and the Southern American Fur Seal is listed in CMS Appendix II. 

In its report (CEPIII / WP 18) on “Specially Protected Species” (SCAR, 2000), SCAR highlighted that all Fur Seal species do not require any longer special protection under Annex II of the Madrid Protocol, but that the Ross seal should remain on the list until the Antarctic Pack Ice Seals Programme has completed analysing its data.


Antarctic birds

The IUCN Red List covers all the albatross species, but only some of the petrel and penguin species occurring in the Antarctic Treaty area (see Attachment IV).  None of the shag, shearwater, tern, gull and skua species are included in the IUCN Red List.  All albatross species and two petrel species (Southern Giant-petrel and the White-chinned Petrel) are critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near-threatened.  Two penguin species are also vulnerable (Macaroni and Eastern Rockhopper penguins) and one penguin species is near threatened (Gentoo Penguin).

In 2001, SCAR published a report “A Statistical Assessment of the Status and Trends of Antarctic and Subantarctic Seabirds” (Woehler, E. et al., 2001).  The report reflects upon a workshop on the same subject that was held under the auspices of SCAR, CCAMLR and NSF.  

The report highlighted the following trends:
    •  “Significant decreases in populations are evident for those species known to be caught on longline fisheries (albatrosses, Southern Giant Petrel and Procellaria spp.).
    • Substantial changes were noted for many of the penguin populations examined, but these varied in terms of degree and direction among species and geographical areas, so that no completely consistent overall pattern emerged […].
    • For some species of unfavourable conservation status (Birdlife International, 2000) very limited, if any, data are available for assessment of population trends (e.g. White-chinned Petrel, Grey Petrel […]).  Other species with notably inadequate data include Light-mantled Albatross […].
    • Almost no data are available on trends in burrowing petrel species; however, obtaining such data present special difficulties.  It would be optimistic to expect to detect other than very large-scale changes for these species.
    • No time-series population data appear to exist for Antarctic Petrels, a species that is endemic to the Antarctic continent and adjacent waters.  Other characteristic Antarctic species for which there is little current population monitoring include the Cape and Snow petrels and the Southern Fulmar.”

The most threatened species (all the albatrosses; the Southern Giant, White-chinned and Grey petrels) have been listed in CMS Appendix I or II.  This formed the basis for the development of ACAP that covers all these most threatened species.  For the other bird species with known decreasing population, such as the Macaroni and Eastern Rockhopper penguins, the Madrid Protocol is one of the main agreements to provide a legal framework for their conservation.

In its report (CEPIII / WP 18) on “Specially Protected Species”, SCAR highlighted that the following species would warrant consideration to be enlisted as Specially Protected Species under Annex II of the Madrid Protocol.  They include: Macaroni Penguin; Wandering Albatross; Grey-headed Albatross; Southern Giant Petrel; and White-chinned Petrel.

Attachment I
Brief on Antarctic wildlife-related conventions

Madrid Protocol - The Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to The Antarctic Treaty was adopted in Madrid on 4 October 1991 and entered into force on 14 January 1998.  The main purpose of the Madrid Protocol is to provide for the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.  The Protocol designates Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science, prohibits mineral resource activities other than scientific research, and sets principles and measures for the planning and conduct of all activities in the Antarctic Treaty area. The Protocol comprises five annexes, including Annex II on the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora. 
 
CCAMLR - The Convention on the Protection of Antarctic Marine Living Resources was adopted on 20 May 1980 and entered into force on 7 April 1982.  The main purpose of the Convention is the conservation and rational use of Antarctic marine living resources.  To this end, the Convention established a Commission that formulates conservation measures based on best scientific data available.

CCAS - The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals was adopted in London on 1 June 1972 and entered into force on 11 March 1978.  The Convention’s objectives are the protection, scientific study and rational use of Antarctic seals.

ICRW - The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling was adopted on 2 December 1946 and entered into force on 10 November 1948.  The Convention regulates the taking of whales, with reference to seasons, areas and methods of taking, and, to this end, sets up an International Whaling Commission for the control of whaling, both from land- stations and by pelagic operations, and to “provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks” by guiding international research and serving as the forum for the discussion of conservation measures for cetaceans. It is supplemented by a Schedule in which details of the stocks on which taking may be conducted and the number of whales which may be taken are set out, and in which provisions are made for protected stocks and protected areas (including whale sanctuaries).

CITES - The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was adopted in Washington on 3 March 1973 and entered into force on 1 July 1975.  CITES’ objective is to prevent international trade from threatening the survival of wild fauna and flora.  To this end, the Convention has established an international network for the control of international trade.  Such control is primarily done through government permits/certificates. Species which are subject to such trade controls are listed in three appendices: CITES Appendix I that includes all species threatened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade; CITES Appendix II that includes all species which although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens thereof is subject to strict regulations, as well as species that are similar in appearance to these species; and, CITES Appendix III that includes the species which have been identified by individual Parties as requiring the cooperation of other Parties for the purpose of controlling their trade.

CMS - The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals was adopted in Bonn on 23 June 1979 and entered into force on 1 November 1983.  CMS’ objective is to conserve migratory species over the whole of their range.  To this end CMS provides a framework for 1) adopting strict protection measures for species in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range (CMS Appendix I species); 2) concluding agreements for the conservation of species that have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international cooperation (CMS Appendix II species).

ACAP - The Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was adopted in Canberra on 19 June 2001 and entered into force on 1 February 2004.  ACAP’s’ objective is to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for albatrosses and petrels listed in ACAP Annex I.  To this end ACAP will promote coordinated action to mitigate known threats to albatross and petrel populations; coordination of data collection, analysis and dissemination of information; assessment of the international and regional conservation status of albatrosses and petrels and threats to the species; and communication of the conservation status of albatrosses and petrels to relevant international and regional bodies to promote action.

PROTECTION STATUS OF ANTARCTIC MAMMALS:
CETACEANS 

 

Ver2.3: refers to version 2.3 of the IUCN Red List criteria (see Attachment VI)

(#) It should be noted that the IUCN Red List assessment of the state of conservation of cetaceans (in particular those occurring south of 60 degree latitude south) could be outdated and may not reflect accurately on their actual state of conservation.

Madrid Protocol
(*)  Whales are primarily dealt with by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.  Article 7 of Annex II of the Madrid Protocol states “Nothing in this Annex shall derogate from the rights and obligations of Parties under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling”.  However, since no agreement has been reached within the IWC on its legal competence to regulate dolphins and porpoises, Article 7 of Annex II may not apply for small cetaceans.

CCAMLR
(**)  As whales are primarily dealt with by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, no measures regarding whales have been adopted. Article VI of CCAMLR states “Nothing in this Convention shall derogate from the rights and obligations of the Contracting Parties under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling”.  It should, however, be noted that no agreement has been reached within the IWC on its legal competence to regulate dolphins and porpoises.

ICRW
(1) Commercial whaling prohibited on all whale stocks worldwide since the 1986 coastal and the 1985/85 pelagic seasons.  Future commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary prohibited since 6 December 1994. The Government of Japan lodged an objection to the Southern Ocean Sanctuary extent that it applies to the Antarctic Minke Whale stocks.
It should be noted, however, that ICRW Article VIII makes scientific whaling – i.e. lethal research, under a “special permit” granted by any Contracting Government – “exempt from the operation of this Convention.”  Therefore, the ICRW places no restriction on scientific whaling, even if it is conducted in a designated Sanctuary, and regardless of whether it is undertaken for commercial benefit.

CITES
App.I   CITES Appendix I includes all species that are threatened with extinction and that are or may be affected by trade.    Trade in these species is subject to particularly strict regulation.  In case of an introduction from the sea of specimen of a species in CITES Appendix I, three conditions must be met: 1) the introduction will not be detrimental to the survival of the species; 2) the specimen is not to be used for primarily commercial purpose; and 3) in case of living specimen, the State of introduction is suitable equipped to house and care for it.
App.II  CITES Appendix II includes all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade in specimens thereof is subject to strict regulations.    Trade in these species is subject to regulation.  In case of an introduction from the sea of specimen of a species in CITES Appendix II, two conditions must be met: 1) the introduction will not be detrimental to the survival of the species; and 2) in case of living specimen, the State of introduction is suitable equipped to house and care for it.

CMS
App.I   CMS Appendix I includes migratory species that are endangered.  The taking of specimens of such species is prohibited. Exceptions can be made if the taking is for scientific purposes, for the purpose of enhancing the propagation or survival of that species, or for accommodating the needs of traditional subsistence users, provided that the exceptions are precise as to content and limited in space and time, and would not operate to the disadvantage of the species.  
App.II   CMS Appendix II includes migratory species that have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international cooperation.  Range States of CMS Appendix II species should endeavour to conclude agreements where these should benefit the species.

Madrid Protocol
 (*)  In accordance with Article 3 of Annex II to the Madrid Protocol, the taking or harmful interference is prohibited, except in accordance with a permit.  A permit shall only be issued for: (a) providing specimens for scientific study or scientific information; (b) providing specimens for museums, herbaria, zoological and botanical gardens, or other educational or cultural institutions or uses; or (c) providing for unavoidable consequences of scientific activities not otherwise authorised under sub-paragraphs (a) or (b) above, or of the construction and operation of scientific support facilities.  Further conditions on the issuance of permits are given in Article.3 para.3.
App.A  Species listed in Appendix A to Annex II are designated “Specially protected Species”.  A permit shall not be issued to take a Specially Protected Species unless the taking: (a) is for compelling scientific purpose; (b) will not jeopardize the survival or recovery of that species or local population; and (c) uses non-lethal techniques where appropriate.

CCAMLR
(**)  As seals are primarily dealt with by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, no measures regarding seals have been adopted. Article VI of CCAMLR states “Nothing in this Convention shall derogate from the rights and obligations of the Contracting Parties under […] the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals”.

CCAS
(***)  Maximum catch in any one year.  Further restrictions apply with regard to sealing zones and sealing seasons.  In addition sealing reserves are also established.

CITES 
App.II  CITES Appendix II includes all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade in specimens thereof is subject to strict regulations.    Trade in these species is subject to regulation.  In case of an introduction from the sea of specimen of a species in CITES Appendix II, two conditions must be met: 1) the introduction will not be detrimental to the survival of the species; and 2) in case of living specimen, the State of introduction is suitable equipped to house and care for it.

CMS 
App.II  CMS Appendix II includes migratory species that have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international cooperation.  Range States of CMS Appendix II species should endeavour to conclude agreements where these should benefit the species.

CCAMLR 
(**)  CCAMLR has adopted a number of measures to reduce incidental seabird mortality associated with fishing. They include:  banning of driftnet fishing (Resolution 7/IX); banning of the use of trawl netsonde cables and set a precautionary limit of 20 birds killed per vessel; and a suite of technical measures to reduce the impact of longline fishing (Measure 25-02).  These measures concern all incidental by-catchs of seabird regardless the species.  The (**) in the above table has been noted against the species that are most adversely impacted by fishing. 
 
CMS 
App.I   CMS Appendix I includes migratory species that are endangered.  The taking of specimens of such species is prohibited. Exceptions can be made if the taking is for scientific purposes, for the purpose of enhancing the propagation or survival of that species, or for accommodating the needs of traditional subsistence users, provided that the exceptions are precise as to content and limited in space and time, and would not operate to the disadvantage of the species.  
App.II  CMS Appendix II includes migratory species that have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international cooperation.  Range States of CMS Appendix II species should endeavour to conclude agreements where these should benefit the species.

ATTACHMENT VI

Definition of IUCN Red List terminology (Ver.2.3 – 1994)
[extract]
CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR) - A taxon is Critically Endangered when it is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future, […]. 
ENDANGERED (EN) - A taxon is Endangered when it is not Critically Endangered but is facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future, as defined by any of the criteria (A to E) as described below. 
VULNERABLE (VU) - A taxon is Vulnerable when it is not Critically Endangered or Endangered but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future, as defined by any of the criteria (A to E) as described below. 
LOWER RISK (LR) - A taxon is Lower Risk when it has been evaluated, does not satisfy the criteria for any of the categories Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable. Taxa included in the Lower Risk category can be separated into three subcategories: 
    1. Conservation Dependent (cd). Taxa which are the focus of a continuing taxon-specific or habitat-specific conservation programme targeted towards the taxon in question, the cessation of which would result in the taxon qualifying for one of the threatened categories above within a period of five years. 
    2. Near Threatened (nt). Taxa which do not qualify for Conservation Dependent, but which are close to qualifying for Vulnerable. 
    3. Least Concern (lc). Taxa which do not qualify for Conservation Dependent or Near Threatened. 
DATA DEFICIENT (DD) A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution is lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that threatened classification is appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, if a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.

The criteria for Endangered and Vulnerable 

ENDANGERED (EN) 
A taxon is Endangered when it is not Critically Endangered but is facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future, as defined by any of the following criteria (A to E): 
A)
Population reduction in the form of either of the following:
1)
An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected reduction of at least 50% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of the following:
a)
direct observation
b)
an index of abundance appropriate for the taxon
c)
a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat
d)
actual or potential levels of exploitation
e)
the effects of introduced taxa, hybridisation, pathogens, pollutants, competitors or parasites.

2)
A reduction of at least 50%, projected or suspected to be met within the next 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of (b), (c), (d), or (e) above.

B) … E)  N/A

VULNERABLE (VU) 
A taxon is Vulnerable when it is not Critically Endangered or Endangered but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future, as defined by any of the following criteria (A to E):
A)
Population reduction in the form of either of the following:
1)
An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected reduction of at least 20% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of the following:
a)
direct observation
b)
an index of abundance appropriate for the taxon
c)
a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat
d)
actual or potential levels of exploitation
e)
the effects of introduced taxa, hybridisation, pathogens, pollutants, competitors or parasites.

2)
A reduction of at least 20%, projected or suspected to be met within the next ten years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of (b), (c), (d) or (e) above.

  B) … E)  N/A 


ATTACHMENT VII


Definition of IUCN Red List terminology (Ver.3.1 – 2001)
[extracts]


CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR) - A taxon is Critically Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Critically Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. 

ENDANGERED (EN) - A taxon is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. 

VULNERABLE (VU) - A taxon is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. 
NEAR THREATENED (NT) - A taxon is Near Threatened when it has been evaluated against the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future. 

LEAST CONCERN (LC) - A taxon is Least Concern when it has been evaluated against the criteria and does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category. 

DATA DEFICIENT (DD) - A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that threatened classification is appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and a threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.
