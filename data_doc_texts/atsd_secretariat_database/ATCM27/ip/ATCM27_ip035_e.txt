INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION FOR TROLL RUNWAY























Initial Environmental Evaluation for Troll Runway

Information Paper 
Norway



Introduction
As part of the international DROMLAN project1 a blue ice runway (Troll Runway) is in the process of being established in the vicinity of the Norwegian research station Troll (72º00’S, 2º32’E) in the Jutulsessen Mountains in Dronning Maud Land. The work on the site was initiated in the 2002-2003 austral summer. An Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) for the construction and operation of the Troll Runway was prepared by the Norwegian Polar Institute and was submitted to the Ministry of Environment for final consideration in 2002. It was concluded that the impacts associated with the activity were considered acceptable, and that they likely will constitute no more than minor or transitory impacts on the environment. 

Parties will be aware that Norway recently also has decided to upgrade the Troll station to a permanent all-year station, and that a Draft CEE for that purpose has been submitted for the consideration of the ATCM XXVII. The process of establishing Troll Runway was initiated before the decision regarding the upgrading of the station was taken, and was therefore considered/evaluated as a separate activity. The two initiatives do, however, clearly interact with each other, creating synergies with regard to future use of the Jutulsessen area and thereby also potential impacts on the environment. For this reason it is assumed that it may be of interest to Parties to be familiar with the Troll Runway project and the considerations done with regard to the impacts of this activity.

On this basis the Summary Chapter of the “Initial Environmental Evaluation for the Construction and Operation of Troll Runway” and an overview of the impacts identified/evaluated are provided for information in the following. The IEE document, with a comprehensive description and evaluation of the activity, can be accessed in full from the website of the Norwegian Polar Institute at http://npiweb.npolar.no (Antarctica  Antarctic Treaty System  List of IEEs).


Summary chapter from the “Initial Environmental Evaluation for the construction and operation of the Troll Runway”

“As part of the international DROMLAN project the Norwegian Polar Institute proposes to establish and operate a blue ice runway (Troll Runway) in the vicinity of the Norwegian research station Troll in the Jutulsessen Mountains in Dronning Maud Land.

The present document describes the proposed activity and the impacts associated with it. The document has been prepared in accordance with § 10 of the Regulations relating to protection of the environment in Antarctica, reflecting the intentions of Article 2 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

The activity has been planned as to minimize environmental impacts. Provided the activity is conducted in accordance with the plans, it is expected that environmental impacts stemming from the activity will be minimal. The analysis has, however revealed a number of potential impacts that may be more significant than the direct impacts associated with the activity:

    • The establishment of the Troll Runway may make this area of Dronning Maud Land much more accessible and thereby increase associated activities both in the Norwegian program, other nearby programs and non-governmental activities. An increase in activity in the area would exaggerate all the impacts that have been identified and furthermore could potentially lead to further consequences not possible to foresee at this point in time. Potentially the access to the Jutulsessen area as a staging area could lead to an increase in activities in surrounding areas, and thereby further decrease the area of Dronning Maud Land that today are relatively untouched by human activities. 
    • A major incident due to failure in takeoff or landing of aircraft is not considered an integral part of the planned activity. There is, however, always a risk for an aircraft incident associated with flight operations, and the risk will increase with the number of flights. The overall incident rate compared to number of takeoffs is very low (on an average less than 2 hull losses per 1 million takeoffs), although likely to be higher in Antarctica due to difficult flying conditions. The consequence of a major incident in the vicinity of the Troll Runway is assessed to be larger and more intense than the direct impacts associated with the planned activity itself, although not expected to irreversibly impact natural functions or processes.

If the activity were not carried out (the 0-alternative) the impacts on the environment would be smaller, but it should be noted that flight operations will take place in the area, and that impacts must be expected in the area regardless.

Having conducted the required analysis of the activity the Norwegian Polar Institute has come to the conclusion that the impacts associated with the activity should be considered acceptable, and that they likely will constitute no more than minor or transitory impacts on the environment. On this basis the Norwegian Polar Institute does not believe the activity merits the preparation of a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation.”

Mechanical actions
Physical environment (surface) will be changed due to grooming. No indirect impacts are envisioned. After a period of no action the area is expected return to natural state.


Extent: L
Duration: M
Intensity: L
Probability: H

No mitigative measures identified.
All alternatives will entail some surface grooming and thereby the associated impacts.

Wilderness





Mechanical actions and Obstructions
Wilderness is no longer considered wilderness when human induced changes are introduced in the natural environment (see e.g. Overrein (2001)). Often a larger zone (e.g. 5 km) surrounding an impacted area is no longer defined wilderness. After a period of no action at the Troll Runway the area is expected to return to natural state.
Extent: M
Duration: M
Intensity: L
Probability: H

No mitigative measures identified.
All alternatives will entail some surface grooming and thereby the associated impacts on wilderness.

No facilities would be necessary in the 0-alternative and no new areas impacted. The probability of associated impacts on wilderness would therefore be lower.



Aesthetic





Mechanical actions and Obstructions
Changes to physical environment by including human elements into natural landscape may change the emotional experience for visitors. Visitors in the area are normally associated with research expeditions and will normally expect presence of human elements in landscape.
Extent: L
Duration: M
Intensity: L
Probability: L

No mitigative measures identified.
All alternatives will entail some surface grooming and thereby the associated impacts on aesthetics.

No facilities would be necessary in the 0-alternative and no new areas impacted. The probability of associated impacts on aesthetics would therefore be lower.








Medium Exposure
Atmosphere





Emission to air
Gases released into the atmosphere can contribute to the greenhouse effect both directly and indirectly. However, in the overall emission picture (both in the Antarctic context and the global context) the contribution from the planned activity is expected to be miniscule. 

Air quality in general may be affected by releasing combustion compounds into the atmosphere. No atmospheric research in the area will be affected
Extent: H
Duration: L
Intensity: L
Probability: H

    • Coordination of flights to ensure that as few as possible flights are conducted. Due to cost restrictions this will always be a planning factor.
    • Use of “clean” fuels as far as possible
All alternatives will entail use of machinery and flights. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

No large wheeled aircraft will land in the area in the 0-alternative. Emission will be lower, and the associated impacts thereby also lower.  

Ice





Emission to air
Combustion products settling on snow/ice surfaces could potentially affect the albedo, which with time could lead to further alterations of the physical environment and ablation rates. Soot deposition has been shown to cause no measurable changes of snow albedo at the South Pole Station where there is higher and more constant emission (see e.g. Wolff (1992) and Suttie and Wolff (1993)).


Ice quality in general may be affected by deposited combustion compounds. This could have bearings on ice related research (e.g. climate research). No ice related research is on-going or planned in the area.

    • Coordination of flights to ensure that as few as possible flights are conducted. Due to cost restrictions this will always be a planning factor.
    • Use of “clean” fuels as far as possible
All alternatives will entail use of machinery and flights. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

No large wheeled aircraft will land in the area in the 0-alternative. Emission will be lower, and the associated impacts thereby also lower.  
Low Exposure
Flora





Emission to air
Uptake of combustion products may in the long run inhibit growth and reproduction in plants. Sensitivity in plants may vary, and changes in species composition may occur. (see e.g. SFT (1992)). 

It is expected that the limited exposure to output will hinder any significant impact. 
Extent: L

Intensity: L
Probability: L

    • Coordination of flights to ensure that as few as possible flights are conducted. Due to cost restrictions this will always be a planning factor.
    • Use of “clean” fuels as far as possible
    • Flights over the Jutulsessen mountains to be avoided.
All alternatives will entail use of machinery and flights. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

No large wheeled aircraft will land in the area in the 0-alternative. Emission will be lower, but since vegetated areas are closer to area of operation exposure may be larger and the associated impacts could thereby also be higher.  


Fauna





Emission to air
Ingestion through food not likely due to marine diet. Inhalation low due to distance from source. Exposure could in the long run affect respiratory system and other vital functions (see e.g. Maniero (1996)).

It is expected that the limited exposure to output will hinder any significant impact.

Probability: L

    • Coordination of flights to ensure that as few as possible flights are conducted. Due to cost restrictions this will always be a planning factor.
    • Use of “clean” fuels as far as possible
    • Flights over the Jutulsessen mountains to be avoided.
All alternatives will entail use of machinery and flights. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

No large wheeled aircraft will land in the area in the 0-alternative. Emission will be lower, but since the seabird colonies will be closer to area of operation exposure may be larger and the associated impacts could thereby also be higher.  


Low Exposure
Noise
Noise may disturb birds in a manner so that they leave their nests (and expose eggs/chicks to environment and predators), raise stress level and increase metabolism, all which could affect the fine tuned balance of energy intake and energy use (see e.g. CAFF (1998) and Giese (1999)).

It is expected that the limited exposure to output will be too low for any significant impact.

    • Coordination of flights to ensure that as few as possible flights are conducted. Due to cost restrictions this will always be a planning factor.
    • Flights over the Jutulsessen mountains to be avoided.
    • Consider limiting grooming activity when wind direction would carry noise toward colonies.
All alternatives will entail use of machinery and flights. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

No large wheeled aircraft will land in the area in the 0-alternative. Noise will be lower, but since the seabird colonies will be closer to area of operation exposure may be larger and the associated impacts could thereby also be higher.    



Obstruction
Birds killed in aircraft encounters is relatively high in the more populated parts of the world (see e.g. www.birdstrike.org). In the case of Troll Runway the number of such incidents is expected to be very low (if any) due to the low number of flights and the observed flight patterns for the birds. Only a few individuals would be affected, and no ripple effect would be expected.

    • Flights over the Jutulsessen mountains to be avoided.

All alternatives will entail use of machinery and flights. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

In 0-alternative the seabird colonies will be closer to area of operation exposure may be larger and the associated impacts could thereby also be higher.  



Low Exposure
Ice





Emission to ground
Jet A-1 is relatively volatile and a large portion of a spill is likely to evaporate instead of migrating into ice. Contaminants that migrate into the ice will be encapsulated and remain in the ice for an indefinite period. Impacts at release time depend on point of release, but could affect biota or quality of receiving environment.

Contributes to overall contamination of environment and may have bearings on future ice related research. No ice related research is ongoing or planned in the area.  

Extent: L
Duration: H
Intensity: L
Probability: M

    • Adherence to guidelines for handling and storage of fuel (Nordic Environmental Handbook)
    • Maintain strict policy of no fuelling of intra-continental flights. 

All alternatives will entail fuelling. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

Less through traffic is expected in association with the 0-alternative (ie. intracontinental traffic). Less handling of fuel will be necessary, and the associated impacts will be lower as well.

Waste
Contributes to overall contamination of environment.

Some types of waste, if spread into the Jutulsessen area, could become “traps” for seabirds (straps, bands, sharp objects, etc.) and could cause death or injury to individual birds.  
Extent: L
Duration: L
Intensity: L
Probability: M

    • Adhere to waste management guidelines (Nordic Environmental Handbook)
    • Institute operational practices that ensures that minimal waste is left in environment (chicken runs etc.)
All alternatives will likely lead to some waste escaping in association with operation. 

Due to less activity less waste would also be expected in association with the 0-alternative.

Wilderness





Emission to ground and waste
Spills and waste will give visible evidence of human presence. After a period of no action the area is expected to return to natural state.
Extent: L
Duration: L
Intensity: L

    • Adhere to guidelines for handling and storage of fuel (Nordic Environmental Handbook)
    • Maintain strict policy of no fuelling of intra-continental flights.
    • Adhere to waste management guidelines (Nordic Environmental Handbook)
    • Institute operational practices that ensures that minimal waste is left in environment (chicken runs etc.).

All alternatives will entail fuelling and likely also potential for escape of waste. The associated impacts are expected for all alternatives.

Less intracontinental traffic is expected in association with the 0-alternative (through traffic). Less activity will lead to less waste and fuel handling, and the associated impacts will be lower as well.
