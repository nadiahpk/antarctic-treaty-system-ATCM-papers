ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY


REPUBLIC OF KOREA
2003/2004 SEASON

This Report has been prepared in compliance with Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

Notification of the measures taken pursuant to Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Protocol 

This Protocol entered into force on January 14, 1998 for the Republic of Korea, which deposited the instrument of Ratification on January 2, 1996.

 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, has legislated a law to implement the Protocol in Korea, the "Act on Antarctic Activities and Environmental Protection" on March 22, 2004. 

 The draft of this Act was unanimously approved in the National Assembly on March 2, 2004 with a hope that the Republic of Korea could contribute more to international efforts to protect the Antarctic. In accordance with Addendum (1) of this Act, it will enter into force from September 23 of this year, and its Enforcement Decree will be prepared before the date.

This Act prescribes that all activities in the Antarctic shall be subject to permission, in advance, which is provided by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which shall consult with the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries in granting such permission. 

A person who plans to conduct an activity in the Antarctic shall submit preliminary, initial, or comprehensive environmental impact evaluation, depending on the potential scale of impact of the activity on the environment of the Antarctic.

In addition, this Act reflects the contents and strengthens the standards stipulated in the Protocol by requiring a permit issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade when ⅰ) capturing, taking or removing Antarctic fauna and flora out of the Antarctic, or ⅱ) visiting the Antarctic Specially Potected Area, the Antarctic Specially Managed Area or historic sites and monuments designated at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

The details of terms and procedures of this Act, as mentioned above, will be regulated by a Presidential Decree, which is currently being prepared.
