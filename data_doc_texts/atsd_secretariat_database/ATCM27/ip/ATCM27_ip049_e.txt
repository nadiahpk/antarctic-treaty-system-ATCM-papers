Report of the CEP Observer to SC-CAMLR XXII, 27 to 31 October 2003





















Report of the CEP Observer to 
SC-CAMLR XXII, 27 to 31 October 2003

1.	The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) agreed at its second meeting (Peru, 1999), that a CEP representative should attend meetings of the Scientific Committee to CCAMLR (SC-CAMLR) as an observer.  At CEP-V (Poland, 2002), Dr Tony Press (Australia) was appointed to represent CEP at SC-CAMLR XXI (October 2002).  Dr Press also represented CEP at SC-CAMLR XXII (October 2003).

2.	SC-CAMLR XXII was held in Hobart, from 27 to 31 October 2003.  All CCAMLR Members attended.  Contracting Parties to the CCAMLR Convention were invited to attend and Canada, Greece, Netherlands and Peru were represented.  As part of CCAMLR’s ongoing relationship building efforts, a number of non-Contracting Parties with interests in fishing in the Convention Area or trade in toothfish were invited to attend SC-CAMLR XXII, and the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Mauritius, and the Seychelles sent representatives. 

3.	Both the Scientific Committee and the Commission noted that CEP was represented by Dr Tony Press (Australia).

SC-CAMLR XXII
Ecosystem Monitoring and Management
4.	The meeting of the Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM) was held from 18 to 29 August 2003 in Cambridge, UK.  The Chair reported to SC-CAMLR XXII that intersessional activities had been conducted by correspondence groups on: the analysis of CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) data; modifications to the CCAMLR Scientific Observers Manual; ecosystem modelling approaches; the design of land-based krill predator surveys; and the subdivision of CCAMLR statistical areas into ecologically-based harvesting units. 

5.	Following the report from WG-EMM, the Scientific Committee discussed provisions for bycatch in Subarea 88.1. It advised that the total bycatch limits for the subarea should be the same as for 2002/03, and that catch limits for each small-scale research unit (SSRU) should be pro-rated in the same way as the catch limits for Dissostichus spp. It encouraged further work in the intersessional period to examine more appropriate SSRU bycatch levels that are more in accordance with the bycatch distribution and abundance.

6.	During the intersessional period CEMP datasets were validated and analyses undertaken related to serial correlation and power of CEMP predator indices to detect change, and functional responses between these indices and measures of krill availability.  The Scientific Committee recommended that such analyses be conducted on the full suite of CEMP indices in the near future and endorsed the recommendation that the data requirements and analytical procedures required to evaluate the indices of krill availability derived from fisheries data should be defined.   

7.	Several recent studies describing changes in the physical environment of the Southern Ocean during the latter part of the 20th century and biological responses to these changes were reviewed.  Given the number of indications of environmental change in the Convention Area, the Working Group considered that it may be appropriate to produce a coherent overview of environmentally induced variability in the Southern Ocean and to consider potential scenarios that might influence ecological relationships with implications for fisheries management

8.	The Scientific Committee endorsed the need for a major review of the content and structure of the Scientific Observers Manual. It recommended that this activity be achieved through an intersessional group that comprised technical coordinators and Members of the Working Group for Fish Stock Assessment (WG-FSA), coordinated by the Secretariat.

9.	The Scientific Committee noted that, in accordance with WG-EMM’s long-term work plan, WG-EMM would hold a ‘Workshop on Plausible Ecosystem Models for Testing Approaches to Krill Management’ during its 2004 meeting to develop plausible operating models of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. These models would then be used to test and evaluate candidate management procedures during a workshop scheduled to be held during the 2005 meeting of WG-EMM.
Fishery Status and Trends
10.	Fourteen CCAMLR Members participated in eight fisheries under Conservation Measures in force in the 2002/03 season (1 December 2002 to 30 November 2003). A further four fisheries were undertaken inside EEZs within the Convention Area targeting Dissostichus eleginoides.
Finfish resources 
11.	Seven fisheries, including two exploratory fisheries, were fished for finfish under conservation measures in force during the fishing season of 2002/03. These included fisheries for D. eleginoides and Champsocephalus gunnari in Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2, and exploratory fisheries for Dissostichus spp. in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2 and Division 58.4.2. Other fisheries for D. eleginoides occurred in the EEZs of South Africa (Subareas 58.6 and 58.7) and France (Subarea 58.6 and Division 58.5.1) by longlines.  

12.	The following table provides information on the reported catches of Dissostichus spp. in 2002/03.

13.	WG-FSA estimated that illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) toothfish catches for the 2002/03 fishing season totaled 10 070 tonnes, compared with 11 857 tonnes for the 2001/02 fishing season. 

14.	The total reported catch of mackerel icefish (C. gunnari) for the 2002/03 season was 4 498 tonnes, compared with 3 506 tonnes in the previous season. These fisheries were undertaken in Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2.

Krill resources

15.	At the time of the meeting, a total of 110 334 tonnes of krill (Euphausia superba) had been caught during the 2002/03 fishing season, compared with 125 987 tonnes in 2001/02. The total catch was taken from Area 48 in the South Atlantic by Japan, Poland, Republic of Korea, Ukraine and the USA. 

16.	The Scientific Committee noted that the projected krill catch for 2003/04 was more than 30% greater than the expected total catch for 2002/03. This projected increase is
significant because in most previous years total future catch levels indicated to the Scientific Committee had been at or below existing catch levels.  

17.	If the projected rate of increase were to continue, then the trigger level of 620 000 tonnes in Area 48 could be reached in five to six years and that the fishery may start to expand faster than the capacity of the Scientific Committee to provide management advice. Although such a sustained increase in krill catches over a number of years may be unlikely, the Scientific Committee noted that it did not currently have access to reliable information from which it could assess how likely such an increase might be.

18.	It was noted in 2003 that the Commission requested recommendations for a subdivision of the precautionary catch limit in Area 48, and that further discussion of this topic would take place in 2004 after the WG-EMM modelling workshop.

19.	WG-EMM reported that it was unable to make any assessment of the developments in the krill fishery because information on future fishery plans by Members was incomplete and/or anecdotal. The Scientific Committee agreed that annual submission of information on the detailed fishing plans of all Member nations was required and that this would include at a minimum: the number of vessels, the locations of planned fisheries, the months when fishing would proceed and the expected catch levels.  

20.	Accordingly, a pro forma was designed and the Scientific Committee agreed that completed forms should be submitted in advance of the annual meeting of WG-EMM by Members intending to fish for krill in the upcoming season so that appropriate advice could be provided to the Scientific Committee on trends in the krill fishery.

21.	The Scientific Committee endorsed WG-EMM’s recommendation that the Secretariat continues to report krill catches by Small Scale Management Unit (SSMU). The approaches to validate CEMP indices of krill availability based on fisheries information indicated by WG-EMM were endorsed. 

Crab and squid resources 
22.	No target fisheries for stone crabs or squid were exploited in 2002/03 and no proposals for the harvest of crabs or squid have been received by CCAMLR for the 2003/04 season. The Scientific Committee recommended that existing Conservation Measures 52-01 and 52-02 on stone crabs and Conservation Measure 61-01 for the squid Martialia hyadesi should remain in force.

Incidental mortality

23.	The Scientific Committee noted that in the Convention Area in 2003, one southern elephant seal was reported killed by a longline vessel in Subarea 48.3 and two Antarctic fur seals and five southern elephant seals were reported killed by trawl and longline operations in Division 58.5.2.  Poland reported that its krill trawl fishing vessel in Area 48 caught 73 Antarctic fur seals of which 26 were killed.

24.	The Scientific Committee noted that:

    • in the trawl fishery for C. gunnari/D. eleginoides in Division 58.5.2, 15 seabirds were entangled of which six were killed; 
    • in the C. gunnari trawl fishery in Subarea 48.3, 43 seabirds were entangled, at least 36 fatally; and
    • although levels of seabird bycatch mortality in the trawl fishery in Subarea 48.3 have reduced from 93 in 2001 to 73 in 2002 to 36 in 2003, corresponding bycatch rates of 0.25, 0.15 and 0.20 birds per haul, show no clear trend;

25.	The Scientific Committee noted for the longline fishery that:

    • for Subarea 48.3 the total estimated seabird bycatch in 2003 was only 8 birds at a rate of 0.0003 birds/thousand hooks, even lower than the values of the last three years;
    • within the South African EEZs in Subareas 58.6 and 58.7, the total estimated seabird bycatch was seven birds at a rate of 0.003 birds/thousand hooks, maintaining the substantial reduction from the situation two years ago.  The causes of this marked improvement were unknown, although fishing effort was still reduced; and
    • no incidental mortality of seabirds was observed in Subarea 88.1 (for the seventh successive year), and 88.2 (for the second successive year), nor in Divisions 58.4.2 and 58.5.2, presumably due to strict compliance with conservation measures.

26.	The Scientific Committee particularly noted that the estimated total of seabirds killed in regulated longline fisheries (15) represents the lowest estimated seabird bycatch yet reported for these parts of the Convention Area. It recollected that the comparable figure for 1997, when CCAMLR started to implement conservation measures to address the problem, was 6 589 seabirds killed. 

27.	The Scientific Committee was concerned that no data from longline fishing in French EEZs in Subarea 58.6 and Division 58.5.1 had been submitted for 2003, nor, as requested and promised last year, for 2002.  However the Committee acknowledged France for sending a scientist to the ad hoc Working Group on Incidental Mortality Associated with Fishing (WG-IMAF) meeting; for providing information on seabird incidental mortality in these areas for the last two years; and a detailed summary of French actions to address the problem to be supplemented by a paper on this topic for the Commission meeting.  
28.	The Scientific Committee noted that the levels of seabird bycatch in the French EEZs, as reported by France are the highest ever reported for any part of the Convention Area and that these rates and levels of seabird bycatch are likely to be unsustainable.

29.	France responded by stating that it had intensified its efforts to rectify the situation,  by using and trialling many methods to avoid seabird mortality and by implementing a variety of regulations, including a month-long closure of the fishery, and vessel-specific bycatch avoidance requirements, all designed to help fishers avoid catching birds. France noted that the seabird bycatch rate in 2003 was significantly lower than in 2002 and that indications from fishing at the start of 2004 were that bycatch rates were lower still.

Issues taken from SC-CAMLR to CCAMLR XXII
Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Convention Area

30.	The estimated IUU catch for all areas in the 2002/2003 fishing season was 10 070 tonnes, compared with an estimated 11 857 tonnes in 2001/02 season. The estimated IUU catch within the Convention Area was 38.7% of the total catch in 2002/03 compared with 43.7% in 2001/02. When the 18 919 tonnes of toothfish reported via the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) as caught outside the Convention Area are added, the total global removal of toothfish in the 2002/03 season is estimated at 44 920 tonnes, compared to 62 643 tonnes during the 2001/02 season. 

31.	Catches in Area 47 reported through the CDS increased substantially from 655 tonnes to 2 852 tonnes with respect to the previous season. Catches in FAO Area 41 had declined from 4 472 tonnes in 2001/02 to 1 934 tonnes in 2002/03. In Area 51 catches declined from 10 620 tonnes in 2001/02 to 3 648 tonnes in 2002/03, in Area 57 from 3 803 tonnes to 858 tonnes. The extent to which this decline had actually occurred was debated. Some Members felt that reported catches had declined substantially. Others were of the opinion that the extent to which catches had decreased remained unclear as catches derived from CDS information were still incomplete with respect to the 2002/03 season.

32.	CDS data were regarded as insufficient to estimate the level of IUU catches. The Scientific Committee drew the attention of the Joint Assessment Group (JAG) to the additional use of trade data. The Scientific Committee reiterated, however, that IUU catches were far too high and would lead to a substantial reduction of the fishery resources in the near future.

33.	At the 2002 SC-CAMLR meeting, the Commission endorsed a proposal for a JAG comprising members of both the Scientific Committee and the Standing Committee on Implementation and Compliance (SCIC)1. The Commission requested that in the intersessional period the JAG convener develop the terms of reference for the group, create an appropriate membership for the group, and prepare reports to the WG-FSA and SCIC.  

34.	JAG did not meet prior to the 2003 WG-FSA meetings and its definitive estimate of total removals was therefore not available for use in the assessment process.  It was suggested that it would be desirable for JAG to meet prior to WG-FSA in future, to familiarise itself with the methods used to estimate total removals as it may be useful in the development of a single procedure to be used for compliance and assessment purposes.  The Scientific Committee concurred with these suggestions and agreed that in future JAG will meet prior to WG-FSA.

35.	The Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp., adopted by the Commission at CCAMLR XVIII, requires that Parties document the nature and origin of all toothfish catches, transshipments, landings and imports involving their flag vessels, ports and markets. The CDS came into force on 7 May 2000.  The Commission agreed to continue the trial of the pilot electronic web-based CDS in 2003/04. The pilot project will be run in parallel with the current paper system. It will be evaluated prior to a decision by the Commission on full implementation. 
Assessment and avoidance of incidental mortality of Antarctic marine living resources
36.	As requested by the Scientific Committee last year, the Secretariat prepared a paper on the current status of national surveys on monitoring of marine debris and their impact on marine mammals and seabirds in the Convention Area.

37.	The CCAMLR marine debris database contains data from 11 sites, all within Area 48.  A summary of the trends indicated that:

    • marine debris, principally packaging items and fishing gear, reached a peak in the period 1994–1996 at Bird Island and Signy Island and has declined thereafter;
    • the level of marine debris found in seabird colonies at Bird Island has increased particularly since 1998, with fishing gear, such as lines and hooks, forming the major part of the debris;
    • marine mammal (Antarctic fur seal) entanglement at Bird Island reached a peak in 1993 and showed a decline until 2000, thereafter there has been a slight increase with packaging bands, synthetic string and longline being the main entanglement material;
    • the number of seabirds contaminated with hydrocarbons remains low;
    • fisheries-related debris, including plastic packaging bands, were the dominant debris type in all areas; and
    • nylon braid and plastic packaging bands were the most frequently recorded entangling material.

38.	The Scientific Committee noted that very few Members provided information on marine debris on the CCAMLR standard reporting forms and requested that Members submit such data in order to facilitate the consideration of the status and trends in marine debris by the Scientific Committee.

39.	Members were encouraged to work with the Secretariat during the intersessional period in order to improve the presentation of information on marine debris research and develop standardised procedures for the analysis of marine debris data. 

40.	Analysis of bird bycatch data collected within the CCAMLR fishery found that there was:

    • an exceptionally low level and rate of seabird bycatch in regulated longline fisheries in most parts of the Convention Area in 2003;
    • serious concern at levels and rates of seabird bycatch in the French EEZs in Subarea 58.6 and Division 58.5.1; and
    • progress with research on mitigation measures, especially integrated weighting of longlines, relevant to Conservation Measure 25-02.

41.	The Scientific Committee noted that no new data were reported this year on incidental bird mortality outside the Convention Area. It asked Members to respond next year to this standing request for information on Convention Area seabirds killed in nearby areas.

42.	The Scientific Committee noted that an extensive review of current methods, initiatives and results had been undertaken relating to longline fishing and incidental seabird mortality mitigation measures, especially on improving practices in the Convention Area and revising the specification of Conservation Measure 25-02. It welcomed the successful outcome of trials of integrated weight (IW) longlines, whereby in New Zealand waters bycatch on IW lines and control lines were 1 and 81 white-chinned petrels respectively.

43.	The IW trial's outcome was becoming one of considerable benefit both to seabirds and to fishers and the fishing industry; and it is likely to have a global application. The Scientific Committee congratulated all Members involved in the work so far and encouraged other Members to investigate the potential use of IW longlines in their fisheries.

44.	To enable vital experimental work to take place in the Convention Area in 2003/04, the Scientific Committee endorsed strong support for a trial of IW lines in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2 in 2003/04, together with exemptions from appropriate conservation measures, in order to develop recommendations for autoline weighting as part of Conservation Measure 25-02.
New and Exploratory Fisheries, Precautionary Catch Limits, and Bycatch
45.	Six conservation measures relating to eight exploratory fisheries were in force during 2002/03, but fishing only occurred in respect of three measures and four fisheries.  The only exploratory fishery where significant activity took place was for Dissostichus spp. in Subarea 88.1. A total of 1 792 tonnes of Dissostichus spp. was taken against a catch limit of 3 760 tonnes. The 2002/03 season was restricted by icebergs and sea-ice. Although the Ross Sea Polynya was open, no fishing took place south of 72°30'S because of safety concerns, therefore little catch was taken from the southern SSRUs.

46.	Thirty-one notifications of exploratory fisheries were made for 2003/04.  Four notifications were incomplete or not submitted by the deadline.  As was the case last year, there were multiple notifications of exploratory fisheries for Dissostichus spp. for several subareas or divisions.  While this is of concern, the Scientific Committee also noted that the experience of previous years indicated that a number of these might not be activated.

47.	The Scientific Committee noted that there were a number of notifications for Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 58.6, 58.7 (outside EEZs) and Division 58.4.4 where directed fishing on Dissostichus spp. is prohibited. The Scientific Committee noted that conservation measures indicated that these will remain closed to the toothfish fishery until a survey has been completed, the results analysed, and the fishery is reopened on the advice of the Scientific Committee to the Commission.

48.	The Scientific Committee noted that the application of bycatch limits is to provide adequate protection for bycatch species, with the understanding that the fishery operators take steps to reduce and minimise bycatch rates. These bycatch limits, with their attendant uncertainties, should not be used as an indication of long-term sustainable yield, and sustained bycatch at these levels over a number of years would require a revised assessment.

49.	The Scientific Committee agreed that the development of avoidance and mitigation measures for bycatch species should be given high priority. An incentive for the fishing operators in this regard is the reduction in the ‘nuisance value’ of bycatch supplanting catches of target species.
Conservation Measures

50.	A total of twenty-seven new Conservation Measures and one Resolution were adopted by the Commission, and seven Measures and one Resolution were revised. The Measures dealt with the CDS, the compliance of vessels with CCAMLR Measures, research plans, prohibition of directed fisheries, experimental line-weighting trails, precautionary and total catch limits for established fisheries, and new and exploratory longline and trawl fisheries for toothfish and other finfish species.
Assessment of Proposals for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas which include Marine Areas
51.	Annex V of the Protocol on the Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol) came into force on 24 May 2002.  The Scientific Committee endorsed the new name and future tasks of the WG-EMM subgroup ‘Advisory Subgroup on Protected Areas’. 

52.	New Zealand brought to the attention of the Scientific Committee its intention to submit a Protected Area Management Plan for the Balleny Islands to WG-EMM in 2004.  

53.	It was recommended that the Advisory Subgroup on Protected Areas review recent work on marine protected areas during the intersessional period and provide background information to the 2004 meeting of WG-EMM.
