1 Non-technical summary 
 
1.1 Introduction 
Norway has decided to upgrade its summer station Troll in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, 
to a permanent all-year station. The Norwegian Polar Institute, operator of the Norwegian 
Antarctic research program, is responsible for the upgrading. 
 
The fact that the Troll station has summer operations only, has limited the Norwegian 
Antarctic research program thematically, geographically and seasonally. It has been 
considered desirable and necessary to give room for expansion of the scope of the program 
through the establishment of a permanent all-year station. Both scientific and operational 
aspects support this decision. 
 
It was decided that a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) for the concept of 
upgrading the summer station to a permanent all-year station was to be prepared, seeing that 
the conceptual change at the station is quite significant.  
 
The present document describes the proposed activity and the impacts associated with it, 
without going into all the technical details. The document has been prepared in accordance 
with §§ 10, 11 and 12 of the Regulations relating to protection of the environment in 
Antarctica, reflecting the intentions of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
Decisions about details on structural and operational changes have not necessarily yet been 
taken and are therefore not described or considered in detail in the present document. All 
structural and operational changes will be considered through separate environmental 
evaluation processes, unless they are considered to be of a less than minor or transitory 
character.  
 
1.2 Description of the activity (including alternatives) 
The main activity is converting a summer-operated station into an all-year station. The 
conversion into a permanent station will require many minor and some major modifications to 
the physical appearance and technical installations at Troll. The largest changes will 
nonetheless be conceptual rather than physical, since an already existing station will 
constitute the core of the permanent station, and since the activity level during the summer 
season is expected to remain relatively unchanged compared to the current situation. 
 
The following elements, described in more detail below, constitute the main changes 
envisioned as a result of the upgrading of Troll to an all-year station: 
 
- 
Room for new research initiatives. 
- 
Future expansion of the area affected by station operations due to e.g.: 
i. Construction of air-monitoring facilities some distance away from the 
main station complex. 
ii. Establishment of antenna park in the vicinity of the station area. 
 
5
- 
Some expansion of the building complex within the existing station area. 
- 
All-year presence of personnel, and potentially an increase in presence during 
summer. 
- 
Upgrading of technical systems at the station with an increased focus on green 
technology and solutions. 
- 
Increased energy consumption due to all-year presence and 
research/monitoring activity, but nonetheless potentially over time a relative 
decrease in fuel consumption due to focus on energy conservation and 
alternative energy solutions. 
- 
Potentially increased access to and pressure on the Jutulsessen area of 
Dronning Maud Land due to permanent presence at the Troll station. 
 
In the process of deciding to establish an all-year station in Antarctica, other alternatives than 
expanding Troll has not been discussed in detailed. The only true alternative to establishing 
Troll as an all-year station at the existing site is to not establish an all-year Norwegian station 
in Antarctica at this point in time (0-alternative). Such an alternative would entail a status 
quo with regard to the summer operations at Troll, and the station installations and operations 
would remain much the same as today, although periodic and sporadic upgrading would likely 
be necessary.    
 
The decision to upgrade Troll to permanent station was made in 2003. Preparation and initial 
structural improvements have been initiated in the 2003-04 season. The complete conversion, 
including necessary physical changes, is expected to be finalized in 2006. Troll will be 
officially opened as an all-year station in 2005, and the first winter team will stay at the 
station during the 2005 austral winter.  
 
 
1.3 Description of initial environmental state 
The Troll station is situated on permafrost ground consisting of scree blocks and frost 
weathering products. The mean temperature for the warmest month is below 0 ºC and winter 
temperatures may drop below – 50 ºC. The climate is little influenced by heat advected from 
the ocean, radiation from the sun and the atmosphere is the main energy source, and there is 
little precipitation. Predominant winds in the Troll station area seem to be east to west. The 
average wind speed is likely quite moderate, but extreme winds do occur. The precipitation 
level is not high, estimated to be around 200 mm/year. 
 
The conditions at the nunataks of the nearby mountains represent one of the limits for plant 
life on earth. Some areas have sufficiently benign microclimate to support some patches of 
vegetation and associated microfauna. The vertebrate fauna consists of birds only: snow petrel 
(Pagodroma nivea), Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) and south polar skua 
(Catharacta maccormicki). No unique species or assemblages of flora or fauna have been 
registered in the area. 
 
 
1.4 Impact assessment 
The environmental impacts of the proposed changes have been assessed in accordance with 
Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and 
the steps stipulated in “Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica” (CEP 
 
6
1999). Identified outputs from the activity include emission (to air and ground), wastes, noise, 
mechanical actions and obstructions. No environmental elements of high value were 
identified. Two elements were identified to have medium value due to operational and 
scientific concerns, and a number of elements of low value were also noted, such as flora, 
fauna, atmosphere, ice, geology and aesthetic values. 
 
A number of unavoidable impacts have been identified through the assessment, mainly of low 
and medium intensity. Mitigative measures will be instituted to minimize these impacts. The 
following impacts with both high probability and high intensity have been identified, and 
merit prioritization in further mitigation efforts: 
 
- 
Disturbance of micro-organisms (flora/fauna) due to discharge of wastewater. 
Local impact on low environmental value. 
- 
Impacts on ice-free ground due to settling of combustion products. Local 
impact on low environmental value. 
- 
Impacts on ice-free ground due to spills and discharge of substances to ground 
(wastewater, fuel spills, etc.). Local impact on low environmental value. 
 
In association with the upgrading of the station it must be expected that the Jutulsessen area 
will experience a much higher intensity with respect to use of the area. Even so, the additional 
impact caused by the upgrading of Troll will still be relatively non-obtrusive. The following 
may be noted in this respect: 
 
- 
The planned activity will lead to increased emission to air. The existing level 
of emission is quite low, and a limited additional emission is not expected to 
have significant cumulative consequences. 
- 
Stress for the seabirds in the Jutulsessen area may increase due to the increased 
operations, but impacts on fauna due to the upgrading are expected to be quite 
limited since the main change in activity will occur in the season of low or no 
biological activity. The cumulative stress caused by the addition of the planned 
activity is therefore expected to be low. 
- 
With the upgrading of Troll to a permanent station, it is likely that atmospheric 
research and monitoring will be important elements of the research to come. 
This requires a clean environment (pollutants/noise), and efforts will therefore 
be made to ensure limited impact on the science, which also will have positive 
consequences with regard to environmental impacts. Reference is here made to 
experience from the research station in Ny-Ålesund on Svalbard, where major 
efforts have been instituted to ensure a clean environment. 
- 
Wilderness and aesthetic values will be affected by the new elements 
introduced into the environment. However, since this is an area that is already 
affected by ongoing activity, the cumulative impact is expected to be quite 
limited. 
 
No negative effects are expected on ongoing scientific activities. A positive consequence for 
ongoing research is the improvements to operations at the station. Smoother operations, which 
are a likely consequence of the upgrading and the fact that there will be presence throughout 
the year at the station, will benefit the ongoing research activity. 
 
 
7
1.5 Monitoring 
The existing monitoring protocol for Troll station will constitute the basis for monitoring at 
the permanent Troll station. An updated practical monitoring plan will be developed in order 
to take into account the new operational framework as well as take advantage of the 
opportunities the all-year presence gives for more specific and analytic monitoring. 
 
1.6 Gaps in knowledge and uncertainties 
There is sparse written information regarding the environment for the Troll area, which 
contribute to uncertainties regarding the assessment. However, many years of operation at the 
station has given the operator a relative intimate understanding and knowledge of the area, 
which has provided basis for the assessment. The level of details regarding the upgrading is 
presently limited, but it is noted that there is an underlying intention from the Norwegian 
authorities that the upgrading has “environmentally friendly” as a goal. 
 
1.7 Conclusions and recommendations 
It is the Norwegian Polar Institute's conclusion that the unavoidable environmental impacts of 
the upgrading of Troll and associated activities will be of no more than a minor or transitory 
character. The NPI therefore recommend that the proposed activity be implemented as 
described, under the condition that the activity is conducted in accordance with the given 
framework, that separate environmental impact assessments be conducted for the various 
components that will be instituted, that the mitigative measures described in this document are 
followed, and that an appropriate monitoring protocol is prescribed.

2 Introduction 
The Norwegian research station Troll is located in Jutulsessen at 72º00’S, 2º32’E, in the 
Mühlig-Hofmanfjella, Dronning Maud Land, approximately 230 km from the ice edge.  
 
Presently, the Troll station is normally occupied every summer season (early December to 
mid February), with a varying number of personnel. The activity at Troll is part of the 
Norwegian Antarctic Research Expeditions (NARE). Although Troll is the hub of the 
Norwegian Antarctic activities, the station has until now been mostly a logistical hub, while 
the research activity itself normally has taken place in areas outside the Jutulsessen area. 
 
In 2003 Norwegian authorities decided to upgrade the Troll research station to a permanent 
all-year station, enabling research activity to take place both during the summer and winter 
seasons. The process of upgrading the station facilities is planned to take place in the 2004-
2006 period, including the 2005 winter season. Changes will mainly be in the form of 
upgrading/expansion of the present station facilities, and will focus on “green” solutions. The 
formal switch to a permanent station is planned to occur early in 2005, and the first winter 
season will be in 2005.  
 
The conversion into an all-year station will require many minor and some major 
modifications to the physical appearance and technical installations at Troll. The largest 
changes will nonetheless be conceptual rather than physical, since an already existing station 
will constitute the core of the permanent station, and since the activity level during the 
summer season is expected to remain relatively unchanged compared to the current situation. 
 
Norwegian authorities have decided to prepare a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation 
(CEE) for the concept of upgrading the summer station to a permanent all-year station, seeing 
that the conceptual change may be considered quite significant. Furthermore, even though it is 
not a question of establishing a new station in a new location, Norwegian authorities are 
aware that the establishment of permanent research stations by other Antarctic Treaty Parties 
normally has undergone CEE processes since the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty came into force.   
 
The present document consequently describes and evaluates the impacts of the conceptual 
change relating to the conversion of Troll to an all-year station. The document has been 
prepared in accordance with §§ 10, 11 and 12 of the Regulations relating to protection of the 
environment in Antarctica, reflecting the intentions of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
Decisions about details on structural and operational changes are still being planned and are 
therefore not described or considered in detail in the present document. All structural and 
operational changes will be considered through separate environmental evaluation processes, 
unless they are considered to be of a less than minor or transitory character.  
 
A separate environmental evaluation was conducted at the time of the establishment of the 
Troll station in 1990 (NPI, 1990). An Initial Environmental Evaluation was also prepared for 
the operational aspects of the Norwegian Antarctic Research Expeditions (Njåstad, 2000). In 
2002 an IEE for the construction and operation of Troll Runway (NPI, 2002) was prepared. 
Together, these three documents give a description of the environment and today’s activity.

Background information in the present document originates to a large degree from these 
documents. 
 
2.1 Background 
Research activities have taken place in Dronning Maud Land for more than half a century. 
Combined whaling, mapping and research expeditions were conducted already early in the 
20th century, but it was the Norwegian-British-Swedish Maudheim Expedition (1949-52) and 
the activities associated with the International Geophysical Year in 1957-58 that really 
boosted the level of research effort in this part of Antarctica. During that time period and the 
following decades a number of nations have established and operated research stations in 
Dronning Maud Land. Currently eight nations operate stations, while a number of additional 
nations are involved in the on-going research activities in the area. 
 
To establish the Norwegian summer station Troll was considered essential for continuation by 
Norway of modern scientific research in Antarctica. Jutulessen was selected as the location 
for Troll because (NPI, 1990):   
  
1. It was centrally located in relation to Norwegian science priorities. 
2. It appeared to have relatively sparse biological activity and therefore environmental 
impacts would be minimized. 
3. It had logistical advantages in terms of no difficult crevasse areas in the vicinity, and 
there seemed to be possibilities for creating future airstrip. 
4. It appeared to have a relatively benign climate. 
 
Since the establishment of the station in 1990, the station and its operations has continuously 
undergone modifications, although these have mostly been minor in character and must be 
considered normal development of a station of this kind. The most substantial changes were 
described and evaluated in the IEE for upgrading of the Norwegian research station Troll 
(NPI, 1999).  
 
The station has since its establishment served the Norwegian Antarctic research activity 
satisfactorily. However, the type and length of research projects that could take place in the 
area have been limited, because of logistics constraints. These include short shipping season 
caused by sea ice prevalence. 
 
In 2000 a new era was initiated in Norwegian Antarctic research history with flight operations 
to Troll. This change in operational modus has made it possible to expand the research season 
significantly and the research potential has become wider. It has lead to less travel time and a 
potential for longer and more flexible research seasons (possibility of shorter field periods and 
exchange of personnel in the course of the season, for example). 
 
In July 2003 Norway took a further step and announced that Troll is to be upgraded to a 
permanent all-year station. The Minister of the Environment emphasized Norway's 
commitment in protecting this untouched continent for generations to come. The Minister 
noted that through a continuous presence at Troll it would be possible for Norway to get an 
even stronger platform for its research and monitoring efforts in Antarctica.  
 
 
 
 
10
2.2 Purpose and need 
The fact that the Troll station has summer operation only limits the Norwegian Antarctic 
science program thematically, geographically and seasonally. It has been considered desirable 
and necessary to give room for expansion of the scope of the program through the 
establishment of a permanent all-year station.   
 
2.2.1 Science 
The following scientific arguments has given rise to the need to establish Troll as a permanent 
station: 
 
1. By establishing all-year operations it will be possible to establish continuous research 
and monitoring tasks at and in the vicinity of the station, and thereby get a 
fundamentally better understanding of the environment in an area of Antarctica that 
otherwise is explored minimally. 
 
2. Year-round operations will make it possible to maintain special emphasis on 
atmospheric sciences. Having a staff at the station all year around increase the 
possibilities for operating air-monitoring programs. Studying the Antarctic atmosphere 
at Troll will help improving representations of important processes for use in global 
climate models and other atmospheric studies. Valuable information may be gained by 
comparing atmospheric monitoring programs at Troll with the research station in Ny-
Ålesund, Svalbard (cf. http://www.nilu.no/niluweb/services/zeppelin/).  
 
3. All-year operations will make it possible to expand significantly ongoing science 
programs, such as the ornithological research at Svarthamaren and the geoscience field 
programs. 
 
4. A permanent occupation at Troll will give a solid foundation for the Norwegian 
scientific contribution to the planned International Polar Year 2007/08.  
 
5. Upgrading Troll to an all-year station fills in a gap in the Antarctic network of existing 
all-year stations with a wide range of scientific projects. The nearest, SANAE (South 
Africa) lies 200 km to the northwest. More distant stations are Maitri (India) and 
Novolazarevskaya (Russia) 300 km to the east-northeast and Neumayer (Germany), 
400 km to the west. 
 
6. Permanent occupation will also render it possible to collect detailed meteorological 
data on a continuous basis, and thereby provide essential background information for 
many scientific projects, as provide input to research that aim to get a better 
understanding of global climate issues. 
 
Norwegian polar activity is mainly focused on the Arctic. A wide variety of scientific issues 
relevant to the Arctic are also relevant to the Antarctic and vice versa. A positive side effect 
of establishing all-year monitoring and research programs in Antarctica will be the potential 
to carry out bipolar comparative studies between the Arctic and the Antarctic.  
 
 
11
2.2.2 Support 
The following operational arguments have given the rise to the need to establish Troll as a 
permanent station: 
 
1. Through the Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN-project) the various 
national operators in Dronning Maud Land aims to coordinate and promote better air 
services for the national operators in the Dronning Maud Land region. As part of the 
DROMLAN package the Norwegian Polar Institute is establishing and will be 
operating a blue ice runway (Troll Runway) in the vicinity of Troll (cf. NPI, 2002). 
The establishment of the Troll Runway will likely entail that the Troll station will be 
more in focus as a communication basis and logistical hub also for other programs 
than the Norwegian program. All-year operations at Troll will enable longer flying 
season and safer operations of the Troll Runway. 
 
2. Norwegian Antarctic research activity in the coming years is expected to continue to 
emphasize research activities for which Jutulsessen is the best geographic position as 
support base (see 2.1 and 2.2.1). All-year operations will make it possible to start 
summer activities earlier and end later. During winter, a permanent staff at Troll will 
be able to prepare for the next year’s scientific expedition, specifically with regard to 
planned field activities outside the Jutulsessen area. This will increase efficiency for 
the scientific personnel, and thereby increase the value of the research conducted in 
the area. 
 
 
 
12
3 Description of activity (including alternatives) 
 
3.1 The concept 
3.1.1 The activity 
The main activity discussed in this document is converting a summer operated station into an 
all-year station. The conversion into a permanent station will require many minor and some 
major modifications to the physical appearance and technical installations at Troll. The largest 
changes will nonetheless be conceptual rather than physical, since an already existing station 
will constitute the core of the permanent station, and since the activity level during the 
summer season is expected to remain relatively unchanged compared to the current situation. 
 
In the 1999 austral winter season the Norwegian Polar Institute gave permit to a private 
expedition to spend the winter at Troll in order to prepare for a ski expedition the following 
austral summer. This gave the operators of the Norwegian Antarctic program the opportunity 
to consider the functionality of the Troll station for winter operation purposes. The experience 
gained during this expedition has been important in the further consideration of the upgrading 
of Troll to a permanent station. 
 
The following elements, described in more detail below, constitute the main changes 
envisioned as a result of the upgrading of Troll to an all-year station: 
 
- 
Room for new research initiatives. 
- 
Future expansion of the area affected by station operations due to e.g.: 
iii. Construction of air-monitoring facilities some distance away from the 
main station complex. 
iv. Establishment of antenna park in the vicinity of the station area. 
- 
Some expansion of the building complex within the existing station area. 
- 
All-year presence of personnel, and potentially an increase in presence during 
summer. 
- 
Upgrading of technical systems at the station with an increased focus on green 
technology and solutions. 
- 
Increased energy consumption due to all-year presence and 
research/monitoring activity, but nonetheless potentially over time a relative 
decrease in fuel consumption due to focus on energy conservation and 
alternative energy solutions. 
- 
Potentially increased access to and pressure on the Jutulsessen area of 
Dronning Maud Land due to permanent presence at the Troll station. 
  
3.1.2 Alternatives 
In the process of deciding to establish an all-year station in Antarctica, other alternatives than 
expanding Troll has not been discussed. The reasons for this has been: 
 
- 
Use of the existing facilities as a core in the “new” station instead of building from 
scratch makes sense both economically and practically. 
 
13
- 
Use of the existing location for the “new” station makes sense with regard to 
minimizing impacts, and operations will take place in a disturbed area instead of 
opening a pristine, undisturbed area. 
- 
Proximity to the Troll Runway (currently under construction). 
- 
The factors that were decisive for location for the original Troll station (see Chapter 2.1 
above) are still valid as location factors for the new station.  
- 
There are no other permanent research stations in the immediate vicinity of the Troll 
location, and for scientific purposes it therefore makes sense to maintain a station in this 
area. 
 
The potential of utilizing capacity at existing permanent stations run by other countries has 
been superficially considered, but have been discarded as this would entail that Norway 
would have to change focus regarding research priorities, both with regard to topic and 
geographic location.   
 
The only true alternative to establishing Troll as an all-year station at the existing site is to not 
establish an all-year Norwegian station in Antarctica at this point in time (0-alternative). 
Such an alternative would entail a status quo with regard to the summer operations at Troll, 
and the station installations and operations would remain much the same as today, although 
periodic and sporadic upgrading would likely be necessary. Consideration of this alternative 
is included in the environmental impact assessment (see chapter 5), but in general it is noted 
that the upgrading of the stations enables a holistic consideration and installment of more 
efficient technology and procedures that in fact may contribute to a decrease in outputs and 
exposure (and thereby impacts), something that will not be so easily achieved by maintaining 
the status quo at the station.    
 
 
3.2 The details 
In this chapter the proposed and envisaged changes to the existing research station Troll is 
described in some detail, both with respect to physical installations and operational 
procedures. Where activities during the operational phase are expected to differ from today’s 
activity or the proposed all-year activity, these are described separately. Alternatives are 
discussed to the degree this is relevant and feasible. 
 
3.2.1 Location 
The present summer station Troll is located in Dronning Maud Land in Jutulsessen at 
72º00’S, 2º32’E, in the Mühlig-Hofmanfjella, approximately 200 km from the ice edge (see 
Figure 1 and Figure 2). The station is located in a north-facing amphitheatre-shaped ice-free 
area covering approx. 15 x 20 km2, enclosing an extensive blue-ice area. The ice-free area 
extends from 1100 to 2400 meters in elevation. Generally expansion in connection with the 
conversion to a permanent station will take place in the area already occupied by the existing 
station operations (an area covering approximately 250 x 250 m2). Future atmospheric 
research and monitoring programs may, however, require installment of buildings and 
equipment in areas not affected by station operations, and an enlargement of the station area is 
therefore likely (see 3.2.3.1). A separate antenna park may also be necessary to provide 
required communication equipment for monitoring and research programs.

Supply transport to Troll station is normally conducted with tracked vehicles from Troll 
losseplass (Troll unloading port) at the edge of the ice-shelf. The overland route to Jutulessen 
is about 280 km. This route will be used during the construction phase, and will continue to 
serve as the main supply route to Troll also in the future. 
 
Approximately 6 km from Troll is the location of the Troll Runway (see Figure 3), which will 
mainly be used for transport of personnel and lighter cargo. The runway may be used 
somewhat during the construction phase, but will first be in full operation after the conversion 
of the Troll station to an all-year facility (cf. NPI, 2002 for further information regarding 
construction and operations of the Troll Runway).

The decision to upgrade Troll to permanent station was made in 2003. Preparation and initial 
structural improvements have been initiated in the 2003-04 season. The complete conversion, 
including necessary physical changes, is expected to be finalized in 2006. Troll will be 
officially opened as an all-year station in 2005, and the first over-wintering team will stay at 
the station during the 2005 winter season.

Proposed changes 
The upgrading of Troll to a permanent station will be based on the existing station complex 
with the following changes and additional structures to ensure sufficient safety, practical 
operation and low environmental impact:  
- 
A new addition to the main accommodation building to accommodate the winter 
personnel and expanded research needs. The structure will be built as an extension of 
the existing station.  
- 
A simple emergency unit, to ensure safe accommodation in case of mishaps to the 
main accommodation units during the winter season.  
- 
A new combined workshop and garage unit. This unit is also envisioned as an 
emergency accommodation unit for the Troll Runway (in case of long-lasting layover 
in bad weather).  
- 
A new container deck is already under construction, and in the future storage 
containers will be placed on this deck. This latter initiative will ensure a more 
aesthetically and clean station area and provide for safer and more practical 
operations. Associated with this it is planned that some of the present storage units 
present today at the station either will be moved onto the storage deck or removed all 
together. It should also be noted that it is envisioned that research labs will be installed 
as container units according to need (for specific projects) placed on the storage ramp 
during the life time of a given research project.  
- 
Finally, it will be necessary to set up at new energy unit, conceptually in connection 
with the garage/workshop unit. 
 
In addition to the changes in the existing station area, an air-monitoring facility will likely be 
planned some distance away from the main station complex, to ensure that atmospheric 
research can take place in an area unaffected by station operations (clean environment).

Likewise it is likely that the upgrading of the station will require a larger amount of antennas 
and satellite readers to accommodate new research and communication needs. An antenna 
park will also be located in a suitable location nearby the station. 
 
Some likely location for outlying facilities is Nonshøgda (Site 1), 500 horizontal and 100 
vertical meters north of the current station area, or Site 2 some 1000 meters south of the 
station (see Figure 6). These are areas currently used by station personnel for recreational 
walks. Separate environmental impact assessments will be conducted for the location and 
design of outlying facilities. The assessment in the present document takes into account the 
concept of an enlarged station area.

converting the station to an all-year operation. Figure 7 shows the conceptual layout of the 
upgraded station, but note again that the station design and physical details have yet to be

3.2.3.2 Personnel 
 
Present state 
Today the main building houses up to 9 people, while additional personnel sleep in the glass 
fiber igloo, garage unit or in tents. Normally permanent summer personnel are accommodated 
in the main building, while transit personnel (field party personnel) use the alternative 
lodgings. 
 
The number of people at the station during summer operations varies significantly. At peak 
periods 30 persons have been associated with the station and its operations. However, this far 
exceeds what the facilities at Troll can adequately accommodate. 
 
Proposed changes 
After the conversion of Troll to a permanent station it will be possible to accommodate 
approximately 20 persons comfortably at the station. This will enable better handling of the 
peak presence that is experienced at the station already today, as well as overlap between 
winter teams. It is, however, not envisioned that the size of the team staying at Troll during 
the summer season will change significantly after the conversion to an all-year station, as it is 
likely that field parties will constitute the core of the Norwegian Antarctic summer research 
program also in the future. Due to easier access by plane, there may be a larger turnover of 
people at the station during a season, ie. a larger number of people visiting the station during a 
season, but no major increase in number of person days. 
 
It is planned to accommodate 6-8 persons at Troll during the winter season, which is 
sufficient to run the station and the envisioned monitoring and research programs. Additional 
research personnel for specific short-term projects can also be accommodated within this 
capacity framework. 
 
Additionally, an emergency accommodation capacity is planned to ensure proper 
accommodation for personnel landing at Troll Runway on their way to other stations in case 
of long-lasting layover in bad weather. Such facilities will be simple, and are planned as an 
integral part of the new garage/workshop unit. 
 
The capacity at Troll is summarized in Table 4.

will only be for emergency/extreme situations. 
 
 
22
During construction 
During the construction period, ie. the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 season it is expected that the 
size of the construction team will be around 20 persons. During the 2005 winter season it is 
likely that a team of 4 persons will stay at the station to finalize indoor construction work.

3.2.3.3 Water supply 
 
Present state 
The main water source during the summer season is melt water from a reservoir underneath 
the blue-ice in the immediate vicinity of the station complex. A network of water pipes has 
been laid out, from the water reservoir to the generator building, from the generator building 
to the station unit, and from the station unit to the discharge point (see Figure 4). The pipes 
are partly covered by gravel. Alternatively water is supplied by melting of snow or ice. Melt 
pans have been installed in both generator buildings, utilizing surplus heat from the generators 
in the melting process.  
 
Proposed changes 
The two systems for water supply that are presently used at the station work in principle 
satisfactory. Although little is known about the quantity and longevity of the fresh water 
reservoir under the blue-ice, it is nevertheless clear that the reservoir is not a source that can 
 
23
be used during the winter operations due to freeze-up. Melting of snow and ice will therefore 
constitute the main source during the winter season.  
 
Technical upgrading will be instituted to improve the supply system for the use of the fresh 
water reservoir. This is likely to mainly entail insulating the water pipe system to ensure less 
problems with freezing of pipes and reduced energy requirement. 
 
A new and improved system for snow/ice melting is planned in association with the new 
generator building. The principal concept will remain the same as the present system, but 
improvements to energy efficiency and hygiene are challenges to be dealt with, as well as 
ensuring a sufficient reservoir capacity.    
 
Alternatives 
No alternatives have been considered. The present systems are relatively simple, satisfy the 
needs and require limited resources (energy, labor, competence, etc.). 
 
 
3.2.3.4 Water conservation 
 
Present state 
No water conservation measures are in place today, although the small capacity at the station 
has naturally limited the amount of water used. No measurement or registration of quantity of 
use has been conducted. 
 
Proposed changes 
Water consumption will increase due to increased activity at the station. This will have 
consequences for operations and wastewater disposal (see below). With the upgrading of the 
station measurement of water consumption will be conducted. Technology and procedures 
will be instituted to ensure water conservation because of the uncertain capacity of the 
freshwater reservoir and the relative labor-intensive snow melting system. Consideration will 
be given to everything from limitations to personal hygiene (e.g. shower time) to reuse of 
treated wastewater.  
  
 
3.2.3.5 Waste management 
 
Present state 
There are no structural installments for waste storage. Waste management at the stations is in 
accordance with the Antarctic Waste Management Handbook for Nordic Antarctic Operations. In 
short, this entails that all waste, except wastewater, is separated, collected in empty fuel drums 
and brought out of Antarctica for appropriate disposal or recycling. The following waste 
management aspects should be noted: 
 
- 
Waste compressor: A waste compressor has been installed at Troll. The compressor 
reduces waste volume significantly and also enables compression of empty fuel drums to 
20% of full size. The compressor is located outdoors. 
 
- 
Toilet: At present one electrical incinerator toilet is in use. The collected waste in the 
holding area is subjected to heat temperatures up to 600ºC for a pre-selected run time up 
to maximum 2 hours (1-2 kW). The heat and smoke within the incineration chamber is 
 
24
filtered through an odor control catalyst and the exhaust is ventilated out. The system 
contains an exhaust blower that continues to extract heat after the heating coil has shut 
down to about room temperature. Five users generate about one cup debris in a week. 
 
- 
Wastewater: A system for purifying/treating wastewater has been installed at Troll (see 
concept illustration in Figure 8). Treated wastewater is expected to reach near drinking 
water quality and can be reused for non-consumption purposes. Wastewater is discharged 
through a heated piping in an ice-free area system behind the station. The treatment 
system has proved to function in principle, but is not satisfactory with regard to 
maintenance (user friendliness) and capacity.  
?
- 
Waste storage: Waste is stored outdoors in empty fuel drums. The area selected is suitable 
with respect to access and snow accumulation, but adds to the somewhat untidy 
appearance of the station area.  
 
- 
Waste production: Since the size of the Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition varies 
from year to year, the amount of waste generated each year varies accordingly. Table 6 
gives an overview of the some of the NARE expeditions the last years, giving an 
indication of waste production at Troll.   
 
- 
Disposal of waste: Today, arrangement for disposal of waste in South Africa is made in 
advance of an expedition. Agreements are made with relevant recycling companies and 
waste management companies. The companies are required to confirm in writing what 
amount of waste has been received and that it has been treated in accordance with the 
agreement.

Proposed changes 
The general strategy for waste management will remain as it is today at the upgraded Troll 
station, although in time consideration may be given to installment of a new incinerator. Clear 
 
25
guidance as to the requirements of the Environmental Protocol (cf. Article 3 (1) of Annex III) 
will in this case be sought. The following should be noted: 
 
- 
Waste compressor: The waste compressor will be moved indoors and waste handling will 
be carried out in protected environment. This should simplify handling procedures, 
prolong the life expectancy of the compressor, and reduce chances of spillage/littering to 
the environment.  
 
- 
Toilet: With the upgrading of the station and increased summer capacity one or more 
additional incinerator toilets will be installed so that the capacity matches that of the 
personnel capacity at the station. This will ensure proper combustion and likely reduce 
handling problems. Toilets will also be installed in association with the emergency 
accommodation. However, since this facility will be operated as an exception rather than a 
rule, field standard toilets are likely to be installed here. Waste from these toilets will be 
treated as normal waste and brought out of Antarctica for proper disposal according to the 
waste management plan. 
 
- 
Wastewater: A new and improved wastewater treatment system will be installed. The new 
system shall ensure simple handling, monitoring of discharge and have sufficient capacity 
to handle the normal personnel load during summer season. Consideration will be given to 
a system that will enable reuse of treated water to ensure water conservation and reduce 
need for energy and labor associated with melting procedures. Discharge is presently 
planned to take place in same area as today. No build up of ice residues has been evident 
in the discharge area so far (due to ablation) and changes to the topography have not been 
evident.  
?
- 
Waste storage: Considerations will be given to how storage can be implemented with less 
aesthetic consequences.  
 
- 
Waste production: Waste production during summer season is not expected to change 
significantly. However, the all-year occupation of the station will increase the amount of 
waste that will require transport out of the continent during a year. It is expected that the 
average waste volume will be roughly three times the volume of today. Waste is today 
transported by tracked vehicles to the ice shelf in connection with arrival of supply 
vessels. In this manner free transport capacity is utilized in an efficient manner. Such 
return capacity will also be utilized in the future. Intercontinental airplanes landing at the 
Troll Runway may also have free return capacity to transport non-hazardous waste. The 
overriding principle will be to transport waste out every summer season, utilizing free 
return capacity on vehicles, vessels or aircraft as far as possible. Waste that cannot be 
brought out during a summer season will be stored appropriately at Troll.

3.2.3.6 Energy  
 
Present state 
Power supply at the stations is mainly based on generators and Jet A-1 consumption. The station 
is equipped with a 46.4 kW (4 stroke) generator and a 15 kW (4 stroke) back-up generator. 
The former consumes approx. 150 liters, the latter approx. 50 liter fuel per day at a much 
lower effect. There is also a 4.5 kW emergency generator at the station. The following aspects 
regarding the energy system should be noted: 
 
- 
Alternative energy: Propane is utilized for heating, water heating and for the kitchen stove 
in addition to traditional fuel. 190 kg gas bottles are stored outside the station, and some 
11 kg bottles are available inside. At current level approximately 100-150 kg is used per 
season.  
 
- 
Fuel consumption for energy: Assuming that only the 46.6 kW generator is utilized during 
a season, the maximum fuel consumption for a normal summer season (75 days) is 
estimated at 24000 liters of Jet A-1 fuel at Troll. The used amount during the last seasons 
is about half of this, recorded at around 6500 liters. 
 
- 
Energy conservation: At Troll surplus heat from the generators is utilized for melting 
snow/ice. Melting pans have been installed in the generator buildings for this purpose. 
 
Proposed changes 
 
27
Electric energy is likely to remain the main source of energy at Troll station also after the 
upgrading, although further steps will be taken to install alternative energy sources at the 
station (solar, wind, stand-alone systems, etc.), and further energy conservation initiatives 
(e.g. utilization of surplus energy, heat conservation, etc.) will be initiated. The following 
should also be noted: 
 
- 
Energy production: The current generator is not dimensioned for today’s operations 
and gives limited flexibility in variations in energy use. Considerations will be given 
to alternative solutions (eg. automatic coupling of several smaller generators) that will 
provide more flexibility as to variations in energy use, and thereby also reduce fuel 
consumption and emission.  
 
- 
Alternative energy: New technologies will be considered. However, two fundamental 
parameters need to be sorted out before final decision will be taken with regard to type 
of installment: i) baseline information at Troll on physical factors affecting energy 
production (eg. wind situation and solar radiation) and ii) safety and reliability of new 
technologies in an isolated environment. The first operating years at the permanent 
Troll station will give opportunity to establishing baseline information regarding the 
two parameters mentioned above. In addition to considering new technologies, it is 
envisioned that the use of propane will continue/expand. Especially the kitchen 
facilities are likely to be upgraded with regard to propane use. This will reduce the 
pressure on the generator system. A long-term goal is to enable summer operations 
running as far as possible on alternative energy sources. 
 
- 
Research needs: With a potential establishment of air-monitoring facilities the energy 
requirements at the station will increase significantly. The research community has 
signaled that such facilities will require a capacity of about 40 kWh, which nearly 
doubles the current maximum capacity. During normal operations a capacity of 
approximately 10 kWh is needed. 
 
- 
Fuel consumption for energy: The energy requirements will increase compared to 
today, both due to year-round station operations and due to the operations of the 
research instruments. Summer operations are expected to remain stable, but additional 
energy will be required during winter operations. Research operations are stable 
throughout the year.   
 
- 
Energy conservation: In the planning of the details of the new station units, care will 
be given to energy conservation measures, such as reuse of heat, heat conserving 
design, winter closure of parts of the station, etc.

3.2.3.7 Transport 
Njåstad (2000) outline the operational framework of today’s transport in Dronning Maud 
Land. The below contains only a short summary with regard to the present situation. 
 
Terrestrial 
 
Present state 
- 
Use of ground transport has three primary purposes: 
 
1) Transport of equipment to/from the stations/ice-edge (vessel) 
 
2) Transport of personnel for field operations 
3) Operations in the station area 
  
- 
Three tracked vehicles of type BV 206 Hägglunds are utilized. The vehicles utilize Jet 
A-1 fuel, approx. 1.3 liters/km with no cargo, and 2 liters/km with cargo. A Prinoth 
Everest is also used for transport of equipment as well as work on the Troll Runway. 
An excavator is being used at Troll for operations in the station area. 
 
- 
Snow machines are used during normal operations, running on gasoline (95 unleaded) 
with some oil mixed in, approx 0.25 liters/km.

Planned changes 
Use of terrestrial vehicles at the all-year station is expected to remain relatively unchanged. 
However, the following should be noted: 
 
 
29
- 
New vehicles will be procured. Two vehicles of Hägglunds type TL-6 and an 
additional Prinoth Everest will constitute new additions to the vehicle park. The old 
Hägglunds BV 206 will mainly be used to local work at the station, while the TL-6 
and Prinoth Everest will be the main components of the overland transport vehicle 
park. The snow machine park will over the next few years be upgraded and machines 
that require half the amount of fuel will replace the existing machines. 
 
- 
Use of vehicles will likely increase after the upgrading of the station to an all-year 
station. A somewhat higher need with regard to transport of supplies/equipment from 
the ice-shelf, and some higher activity at the station itself. The season will also be 
prolonged, but due to conditions (light, snow, etc.) it is not expected that winter 
transportation will be very high.  
 
During construction 
- 
Use of vehicles during the construction phase will be higher than during normal 
operations, both in the station area itself (construction work) and for transport 
purposes.  
 
 
Seaborne 
 
Present state 
The Norwegian Antarctic program uses vessels to transport heavy equipment, and also some 
personnel. The Norwegian program cooperates in the Nordic joint program, and the vessels 
used vary from season to season.  Space may be chartered on vessels run by other national 
Antarctic research programs, but the Norwegian activities also include operation of separate 
vessel to provide a platform for marine research. Further description of vessel activity can be 
found in Njåstad (2000).  
 
Planned changes 
The upgrading of Troll to an all-year station in combination with the increased flight 
operations in the area, may have consequences for the use of vessels in the Norwegian 
program. The large-scale supply operations may take place more irregularly, as small-scale 
supply operations can be conducted by air operations instead. The frequency in use of vessel 
in order to support operations at Troll may therefore decrease in the future. In such a case also 
the extent of vehicle operations may decrease somewhat. 
 
During construction 
No changes to vessel operations during construction period are anticipated. The Norwegian 
program will charter space on vessels already operating in the area to transport construction 
material. 
 
 
Airborne 
 
Present state 
There is currently a general increase in use of aircraft for transport of personnel and cargo 
amongst the national operators in Dronning Maud Land.  
 
Some of the reasons behind this are (NPI, 2002): 
 
30
 
1) Efficient transport to/from the continent; personnel does not have to spend non-
efficient time at sea. 
2) Efficient transport within the continent – less time and resources spent on ground 
transport of personnel to/from place of arrival/departure 
3) Flexibility as to when to get personnel to the continent; can better accommodate needs 
of research project 
4) Efficient time on the continent; personnel does not have to spend unreasonably more 
time than necessary on the continent. 
 
Presently intercontinental flights land at the runway near Novolazarevskaya (Russia), and 
personnel and equipment is transported to Troll by feeder link operations (small aircraft or 
helicopters). 
 
Planned changes 
The Norwegian program is constructing a runway (Troll Runway) approximately 6 km from 
the Troll station (cf. NP, 2002). This eases the access and use of Troll. 
 
The Troll Runway will only be operated in the austral summer season, i.e. currently assessed 
to last from mid-November to mid-February. Possibly ice melting will prevent its use for 
about 3-4 weeks in mid-summer (mid-December/mid-January). It is envisioned that the 
operating season may be extended in both directions in the future as more experience with the 
flight operations at the runway are gained. 
 
It is at this stage difficult to be certain about the type of aircraft and the number of flights that 
will land and take off from Troll Runway during a normal operating season, although an 
indication of potential aircraft types are summarized in Table 10.  An estimate of the potential 
operational intensity is given in Table 11. These should, however, only be taken as 
indications, as it would be somewhat speculative to provide solid numbers at this time. The 
number of flights may increase with time as experience with operations advance.

During construction 
The Troll Runway will not be open for traffic until the end of the 2004-05 summer season at 
the earliest. It is not expected that air traffic will increase or be excessively high during the 
construction period. Helicopters will however constitute an important element in the 
construction period for lifting of heavy equipment and elements. 
 
 
3.2.3.8 Fuel consumption and management 
 
Present state 
There are no structural installments for fuel storage except for one double-walled fuel tank 
(1900 liters) designed for the generator. The following aspects with respect to fuel 
consumption and pollution management should be noted: 
 
?? Fuel consumption: Current level of fuel consumption is summarized in Table 12. Note 
that due to variations in expedition size, the fuel consumption varies extensively from 
season to season. Fuel consumption has been higher the last seasons due to 
construction work on the Troll Runway. 
 
?? Fuel depot: The fuel depot at Troll is currently located on the ice-free ground between 
the ice and the garage unit. Containment mats, on which fuel can be stored, have been 
introduced to Troll. Such mats are meant to retain any small spills that may occur 
during storage. These mats have proved to function according to purpose. 
Furthermore, safety drums are available for immediate protection for damaged drums. 
Empty fuel drums are compacted to reduce volume of waste. There will always be a 
few liters of fuel left in all fuel drums, and consequently a containment system has 
been constructed for the compacting operations, so that no waste fuel contaminates the 
environment. Such leftover fuel is treated as spill oil. 
 
?? Helicopter pads: Containment mats for helicopters have been developed. At Troll all 
helicopter landings, re-fueling, maintenance, etc. takes place on such containment 
mats in order to reduce pollution into the environment.

Proposed changes 
The general strategy for fuel management will remain as it is today at the Troll permanent 
station. The following should however be noted: 
 
- 
Fuel consumption: Due to all-year operations the amount of fuel required for energy 
generation will increase. Energy conservation and alternative energy will be considered 
and installed to the maximum degree possible, but initially fuel generators will constitute 
 
32
the core of the energy production. Even with a more sophisticated generator system, the 
total amount of fuel consumed for energy production is expected to increase. Fuel 
consumption for transport purposes likewise. Due to cost of fuel (transport) it is in the 
interest of the Norwegian Antarctic program to reduce fuel consumption as much as 
possible. Initiatives regarding alternative energy, fuel conservation, etc. have therefore 
both environmental and operational advantages.  
 
- 
Emission: There will be an increase in emission levels corresponding to the increase in 
fuel consumption. Care will be taken in the upgrading of the generator system to invest in 
low emission systems to the degree this is feasible. 
 
- 
Fuel depot: Considerations will be given to how storage can be implemented to further 
reduce the risk of spills and contamination and give aesthetic benefits. Today’s system 
with fuel stored in 200-liter drums on containment mats gives in principle a relatively 
limited chance of large spills to the environment. With continuous monitoring, possible 
with all-year occupation, the chance of mishaps should be even further reduced. 
 
Alternatives

arguments for and against these.

3.2.3.9 Science 
 
Present state 
The location of Troll is a support base for a wide variety of research studies already going on 
in the area, including: 
 
1. The Jutulstraumen/Fimbulisen ice stream/ice shelf system, the largest ice stream in 
Dronning Maud Land. The investigation is concerned with understanding the ice 
shelf/ocean interaction and the response of the system to climatic change. 
2. Glaciological studies on the Antarctic plateau south of Troll in connection with the 
European Program on Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA). 
3. The interrelationship across the geologic boundary between East and West Antarctica, 
probably marked by a large geological break along the Jutulstraumen – Pencksøkket 
glacier system. This discontinuity is the most important key structure for the 
reconstruction of the Gondwana continent. 
4. Studies of the colony of more than 200 000 breeding pairs of Antarctic petrels at 
Svarthamaren, and the energy flow and behavior of this population located 200 km 
from the ocean. Svarthamaren is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is 
located 90 km east of Troll.  
 
Proposed changes 
 
33
An all-year station offers a great potential for establishing atmospheric monitoring programs. 
It will be possible to monitor persistent organic pollutants such as mercury and other heavy 
metals, conduct measurements of climate related gases such as CFCs, its substitutes, SF6, as 
well as ozone and UV-radiation and climate related measurements (see 2.2). To enable such 
studies there are plans to establish air-monitoring facilities some distance away from the main 
station complex (see 3.2.3.1).  
 
Troll is particularly well located as a starting point for glaciological studies on the Antarctic 
ice plateau, and all-year operations will support such efforts even further. Such opportunities 
may be particularly interesting in the context of the IPY 2007/08.  
 
In general it is expected that summer research activity to a large degree still will remain field 
based, although research activity at Troll itself may increase somewhat as room is given for 
all-year monitoring programs based out of the station facilities. 
 
For future research projects the plan is to install required laboratories as container units 
according to need (for the specific projects) on the storage ramp. The container laboratories 
would remain at the station for the duration of the particular research project. 
 
3.2.4 Mitigation measures in place 
 
Present state 
All current activities/operations at Troll have been assessed and are in compliance with the 
requirements of the Norwegian Regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment in 
Antarctica (1995), the Norwegian legal instrument for implementing the Environmental 
Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. 
 
The NP has, in co-operation with its Finnish and Swedish counterparts developed 
environmental guidelines that have relevance for station operations. These guidelines are 
collated in the Nordic Environmental Handbook for Antarctic operations. Operations at the 
Troll station are carried out in accordance with these guidelines. Currently the following 
guidelines have been developed: 
 
- 
Procedures for fuel storage transfer and transport (Appendix 1). 
- 
Oil Spill Contingency Plan (with Fuel spill response guidelines, attached here as 
Appendix 2)  
- 
Nordic environmental guidelines for operations of aircraft and helicopter in 
Antarctica. A short version of the guidelines is attached as Appendix 3 
- 
Waste Management Handbook including waste management strategy (short version of 
Waste Management Guidelines are attached in Appendix 4). 
- 
Environmental Guidelines: flora, fauna and the natural environment (Appendix 5). 
 
 
Other mitigative measures in place: 
- 
Troll is equipped with spill response equipment. 
- 
Personnel and expedition members are instructed both in advance of expedition and 
during expedition in relevant provisions of the legal frameworks and any guidelines 
developed for the purpose. 
 
 
34
Proposed changes 
Guidelines and operating procedures will be updated to reflect the changes in the station 
facilities and operations. Training and education procedures will be reviewed to take into 
account the new operations. In principle, the basic framework described above will still 
constitute the core of the mitigative efforts.

4 Description of initial environment state 
 
4.1 Ground conditions 
The mountains of Gjelsvikfjella (including the Jutulsessen area) are built of an Archean 
basement complex of gneiss and charnockite. The metamorphism ranges from amphibolite 
facies in the west to mainly granulite facies in the east. The lithology varies from granitic to 
gabbroid. 
 
The texture and weathering of rocks vary in a way significant to vegetation. Charnockites 
yield a rugged surface of protruding feldspars, whereas the gneiss have smoother surface 
more suitable for lichen growth.  
 
The ground is permafrost consisting of scree blocks and frost weathering products. Some 
areas thaw during favorable weather conditions in summer, and melting ponds are 
characterized by growth of the green algae Prasiola crispa. 
 
4.2 Climate 
Meteorological data from the Jutulsessen area are sparse. An Automatic Weather Station 
(AWS) has been operated intermittently at the Troll station since 1990. Some basic data 
collected in 1993 is presented in Table 14 to give an indication of climate characteristics.

The sun is under the horizon for 2.5 months during mid-winter, and above the horizon from 
15 November to 27 January during austral summer. Being so far inland, the area is seldom 
affected by cyclonic weather activity. The climate is therefore little influenced by heat 
advected from the ocean, radiation from the sun and the atmosphere is the main energy 
source, and there is little precipitation. The inland mountains hinder snowdrift. 
 
There is sparse information regarding the wind situation. Predominant winds in the Troll 
station area seem to be east to west. The average wind speed is likely quite moderate, but 
extreme winds do occur. The original station complex has been built to endure winds up to 60 
m/s.  
 
The precipitation level is not high. No measurement data from Troll exists, but is estimated to 
be around 200 mm/year. Annual accumulation along a surveying traverse in the area between 
70º, 5ºE and 75ºS, 15ºE has shown a variation from 271 mm at Fimbulisen to 24 mm at 2840 
 
36
m.a.s.l. ( Van den Broeke et al., 1999). Snow accumulates in the station area mostly due to 
wind, and the snow cover in the station area normally melts during the summer season. 
 
4.3 Flora and fauna 
4.3.1 Description 
The conditions at the nunataks of the nearby mountains represent one of the limits for plant 
life on earth. The mean temperature for the warmest month is below 0 ºC and winter 
temperatures may drop below – 50 ºC. Due to high intensity of solar radiation in summer, and 
low albedo, the surface temperature of the nunataks may be considerably higher than the air 
temperature, especially where protected from the wind. Such areas have sufficiently benign 
microclimate to support vegetation and associated microfauna. The vegetation, however, is 
very susceptible to desiccation. 
 
Biological studies conducted in the Jutulsessen area are limited in numbers and scope, and 
have mostly been conducted in the vicinity of the Troll station (see Table 15). The terrestrial 
vegetation is very restricted in species diversity and abundance compared to other areas. No 
rare species have been observed. Invertebrate fauna is found in association with the vegetated 
areas.

(Thalassoica antarctica) and south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). The main locations 
of seabird colonies in Jutulsessen are indicated in Figure 9. In the vicinity of the Troll station 
are two small colonies (~50 pairs) of snow petrel, one just north of the station in the 
Nonshøgda area and one just south of the station area. Breeding south polar skuas are 
registered in Jutulsessen, and non-breeding young skuas are observed in the vicinity of the 
petrel colonies.

4.4 Conservation of flora and fauna 
The following aspects with respect to conservation of flora and fauna should be noted:  
?
- 
Currently no activity at the Troll station directly interferes with the flora or fauna in 
the Jutulsessen area. Further impact assessments will be conducted before reaching 
conclusions with regard to location of facilities (air monitoring facilities, antenna 
park) outside the currently exposed station area.    
 
- 
Vegetation: The areas immediately surrounding the station (radius of approx. 500 m) 
are considered as disturbed areas and pedestrian activity is not restricted in these areas. 
No rare occurrences have been registered close to Troll, and consequently such 
 
38
disturbance has not been considered significant. Vehicle traffic on ice-free ground is 
kept to a minimum, but is necessary for supply and construction purposes.  
 
- 
Bird colonies: The bird colonies close to the stations are not visited unless in 
connection with approved research. When utilizing motorized vehicles personnel are 
instructed keep a distance of at least 200 meters from bird colonies. Aircraft and 
helicopter traffic to the station is kept to a minimum, and care is taken to keep a 
distance to the nearby bird colonies.

5 Impact assessment 
5.1 Introduction 
In the below is documented the considerations that have been done in assessing the impacts of 
the planned activities associated with the upgrading of Troll to an all-year station.  
 
The process used in assessing the activity has in principle followed the steps stipulated in 
“Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica” (CEP 1999). A summary of 
each step of the process is given below. 
 
5.2 Definition of terms 
 
Cumulative impact: 
the combined impact of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities. These 
activities may occur over time and space and can be additive or 
interactive/synergistics. 
 
Direct impact: 
a change in the environmental components that result from direct cause-effect 
consequences of interaction between the exposed environment and outputs. 
 
Exposure: 
the process of interaction between an identified potential output and an 
environmental element or value. 
 
Impact: 
a change in the value or resources attributable to a human activity. It is the 
consequence of an agent of change, not the agent itself. 
 
Indirect impact: 
a change in environmental components that results form interactions between the 
environment and other impacts (direct or indirect). 
 
Mitigation: 
the use of practices, procedure or technology to minimize or prevent impacts 
associated with proposed activities. 
 
Output: 
a physical change or an entity imposed on or released to the environment as the 
result of an action or activity. 
 
Unavoidable impact: 
an impact for which no further mitigation is possible. 
 
 
5.3 Outputs 
Before evaluating the impacts of the planned upgrading a number of activity outputs that were 
considered to have potential for environmental impact were identified. A summary of the 
activities and their outputs is presented in Appendix 6. Identified outputs include emission (to 
air and ground), wastes, noise, mechanical actions and obstructions.  
 
5.4 Considering the environment 
In order to assess the impacts of the planned upgrading the sensitivities and values of the 
surrounding environment have to be evaluated so that the identified outputs can be considered 
against the environment they take place in. A summary of this evaluation is presented in 
Appendix 7. No environmental elements of high value were identified. Two elements of 
 
40
medium value were identified, and a number of elements of low value were however noted, 
such as flora, fauna, atmosphere, ice, geology and aesthetic values. 
 
5.5 Identification of exposures 
It is essential to focus the environmental impact assessment on those impacts that in fact are 
likely to take place. To assist it is useful to consider the interaction between outputs of the 
activity and the environment present at the site. A summary of the exposure evaluation is 
presented in Appendix 8. It is important to note that the exposure level is relatively low for 
most outputs identified in relation to the planned activity. 
 
5.6 Identification and evaluation of impacts and proposed 
mitigative measures 
The impact of the exposure of environmental elements to identified outputs have been 
considered and summarized in Table 16 and Table 17 below. These are impacts that can be 
expected assuming that the activity is conducted in accordance with the framework defined in 
this document.  The following terms have been defined in assessing the impacts:

Any impact assessed to have a medium or high intensity is important to assess further as these 
are the impacts that in fact affect the natural processes in the area. Any impact assessed to 
have a low intensity is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact regardless of 
extent, duration and probability. In Table 16 and Table 17 these are marked with grey shading. 
Prioritization will be given to efforts minimizing these impacts.  
5.6.1 Impacts on Environmental Elements of High Value 
No environmental elements of high value have been identified (cf. Appendix 7). 
 
 
41
5.6.2 Impacts on Environmental Elements of Medium Value 
Two environmental elements of medium value have been identified (cf. Appendix 7). In 
Table 16 these have been listed in accordance with the level of exposure to outputs (cf. 
Appendix 8).  
 
5.6.3 Impacts on Environmental Elements of Low Value 
A number of environmental elements of low value have been identified (cf. Appendix 7). In 
Table 17 these have been listed in accordance with the level of exposure to outputs (cf. 
Appendix 8).

Emission to air 
Combustion gases released into the atmosphere can 
contribute to the greenhouse effect both directly and 
indirectly. However, in the overall emission picture 
(both in the Antarctic context and the global 
context) the contribution from the planned activity is 
expected to be miniscule.  
 
Air quality in general may be affected by releasing 
combustion compounds into the atmosphere. Since 
atmospheric research is planned as one of the main 
elements of the all-year activity at the station, such 
emission may have undesirable effects.

Earlier measurements have indicated PAH-remains 
(very low quantities) in the drinking water (NIVA, 
2000), which may stem from ground pollution, but 
which might also come from the equipment used to 
install water pump and pipes. Contamination will 
remain in reservoir over a long period due to a likely 
lack of water exchange in the reservoir.

Combustion compounds may reach the seabird

birds (habitat and health), the exposure is limited 
due to relatively low emission levels from Troll. 
Ingestion through food not likely due to marine diet.

Emission to ground 
Some micro-fauna and micro-flora and their habitat 
may be exposed to pollution, limited to the area of 
wastewater discharge and fuel handling. Exposure 
will likely destroy individuals and habitat. No 
unique assemblages recorded, and affected area will 
be limited. Elements are not important aspects of a

Medium Exposure 
Noise 
Noise may disturb birds in a manner so that they 
leave their nests (and expose eggs/chicks to 
environment and predators), raise stress level and 
increase metabolism, all which could affect the fine 
tuned balance of energy intake and energy use (see 
e.g. CAFF (1998) and Giese and Riddle (1999)). 
 
It is expected that the limited exposure to output will 
be too low for any significant impact. Note also that 
exposure doe not change from current situation, 
where generators are operated throughout the 
summer season, the time that the birds are present.

Emission to air 
Combustion gases released into the atmosphere will 
settle in the area surrounding the station, although 
areas further away is less affected due to distance 
and prevailing wind direction. Fall-out remains and 
builds up in the environment due to slow break 
down and limited wash-out. Ground quality is 
affected over time, thereby changing the 
environmental quality of the micro-habitats.

Fuel pollution will remain in ground for a long time

al., 1999). 
 
Wastewater is likely to ablate (cf. experience from 
the area) to a large degree, although ice build-up 
may be expected during winter season. Wastewater 
treatment system will ensure minimal pollution in 
discharged water and thereby exposure to pollution.

Ice 
 
 
 
 
Medium Exposure 
Emission to air 
Combustion products settling on snow/ice surfaces 
could potentially affect the albedo, which with time 
could lead to further alterations of the physical 
environment and ablation rates. Soot deposition has 
been shown to cause no measurable changes of 
snow albedo at the South Pole Station where there 
is higher and more constant emission (see e.g. 
Worren and Clarke (1990), Wolff (1992) and Suttie 
and Wolff (1993)). 
 
Ice quality in general may be affected by deposited 
combustion compounds. This could have bearings 
on ice related research (e.g. climate research). No 
ice related research is on-going or planned in the 
area.

Non-native organisms 
and disease 
There are well-known examples of experimental and 
accidental introductions of non-native organisms in 
Antarctica. It is, however, considered likely that 
most non-native organisms will not find suitable 
environment to thrive in the Troll area (due to 
climatic and other environmental factors). Non-
native organisms can displace existing vegetation 
and micro-flora/fauna (Smith, 1996).

Emission to ground 
Some fuel spills may be expected with activity in the 
blue-ice area near the station. Jet A-1 is relatively 
volatile and a large portion of a spill is likely to 
evaporate instead of migrating into ice. 
Contaminants that migrate into the ice will be 
encapsulated and remain in the ice for an indefinite 
period. Impacts at release time depend on point of 
release, but could affect biota or quality of receiving 
environment.

5.7 Identification of unavoidable impacts 
Impacts identified to have a medium or high probability are considered to be 
unavoidable (cf. Chapter 5.6). Efforts to minimize these impacts will be instituted in 
accordance with mitigative measures. The following impacts with both high 
probability and high intensity have been identified, and merit prioritization in further 
mitigation efforts: 
 
- 
Disturbance of micro-organisms (flora/fauna) due to discharge of wastewater. 
Local impact on low environmental value. 
- 
Impacts on ice-free ground due to settling of combustion products. Local 
impact on low environmental value. 
- 
Impacts on ice-free ground due to spills and discharge of substances to ground 
(wastewater, fuel spills, etc.). Local impact on low environmental value. 
 
5.8 Indirect impacts 
Potentially the opening of the Troll station as an all-year station would add to the 
pressure on the Jutulsessen area as a staging area and could lead to an increase in 
activities in surrounding areas, and thereby further decrease the areas of Dronning 
Maud Land that today are relatively untouched by human activities.  Realistically it is 
however believed that even with improved access the activity level in Dronning Maud 
Land will remain relative restricted simply due to costs of operation in the area. It is, 
however, realized that it is extremely important to follow closely the development and 
take appropriate action should the situation require it. 
 
5.9 Cumulative impacts 
The Jutulsessen area is a relatively pristine and untouched area, with the exception of 
the impact created by the Norwegian station facilities at Troll. Although some 
research has taken place in the local area, most activities that use Troll as logistical 
hub has in fact been conducted in more remote areas. The Jutulsessen area has 
consequently mostly been visited only for recreational purposes by the core personnel 
at Troll station. 
 
The increase in air traffic and upgrading of Troll, the related influx of national 
program personnel and the potential increase in non-governmental activities will have 
bearings on the level of activity in the area of the planned activity. It must be expected 
that the Jutulsessen area will experience a much higher intensity with respect to use of 
the area, be it recreational activities, expansion of existing facilities, establishment of 
new facilities, etc. Even so, the additional impact caused by the upgrading of Troll 
will still be relatively non-obtrusive. The following may be noted in this respect: 
 
- 
The planned activity will lead to increased emission to air. The existing 
level of emission is quite low, and a limited additional emission is not 
expected to have significant cumulative consequences. 
- 
Stress for the seabirds in the Jutulsessen area may increase due to the 
increased operations, but impacts on fauna due to the upgrading are 
expected to be quite limited since the main change in activity will occur in 
 
the season of low or no biological activity. The cumulative stress caused 
by the addition of the planned activity is therefore expected to be low. 
- 
With the upgrading of Troll to a permanent station, it is likely that 
atmospheric research and monitoring will be important elements of the 
research to come. This requires a clean environment (pollutants/noise), and 
efforts will therefore be made to ensure limited impact on the science, 
which also will have positive consequences with regard to environmental 
impacts. Reference is here made to experience from the research station in 
Ny-Ålesund on Svalbard (www.kingsbay.no), where major efforts have 
been instituted to ensure a clean environment. 
- 
Wilderness and aesthetic values will be affected by the new elements 
introduced into the environment. However, since this is an area that is 
already affected by ongoing activity, the cumulative impact is expected to 
be quite limited. 
 
 
5.10 Evaluation of impacts on ongoing activities 
5.10.1 
Science 
No negative effects are expected on ongoing scientific activities. A positive 
consequence for ongoing research is the improvements to operations at the station. 
Smoother operations, which are a likely consequence of the upgrading and the fact 
that there will be presence throughout the year at the station, will benefit the ongoing 
research activity. Preparation of equipment for fieldwork can be completed before 
arrival of research teams, facilities at Troll will provide better back-up capabilities, 
etc. 
 
Furthermore, the all-year capabilities of the station will provide a new and improved 
platform for new research initiatives and thereby provide a more solid platform for 
Norwegian research in Antarctica. 
 
5.10.2 
Operations 
The proposed changes and upgrading of the station are not expected to have negative 
consequences for the operations at Troll. On the contrary, the expectation is that new 
technology, new facilities and continuation in presence all will contribute to a 
smoother and better-implemented operation. 
 
 
6 Monitoring 
A separate monitoring protocol has been prepared for the NARE operation (NPI, 
1999b). The aims of the monitoring program are to:  
- 
assess whether the actual impacts from the activity are as anticipated  
- 
establish the geographic extent of impact, and assess any changes to this 
"footprint"  
- 
provide a basis on which to initiate processes to mitigate and minimize impacts  
- 
assess changes in intensity of activity  
 
- 
ensure that the activity is carried out in accordance with international 
agreements and national legislation 
 
Currently the monitoring program bases itself mainly on registration of activity, ie. 
fuel consumption, fuel spills, presence at station (person days), waste produced, etc. 
 
The goals of the monitoring program will remain the same at the upgraded station, but 
an updated practical monitoring plan will be developed in order to take into account 
the new operational framework as well as take advantage of the opportunities the all-
year presence gives for more specific and analytic monitoring. 
 
 
7 Gaps in knowledge and uncertainties 
The following gaps and uncertainties have been identified with regard to the 
assessment of impacts stemming from the proposed project: 
 
- 
Limited written information regarding the environment (especially with regard 
to flora and micro-organisms). However, many years of operation at the 
station has given the operator a relative intimate understanding and knowledge 
of the area, which has provided basis for this assessment. 
- 
The level of details regarding the upgrading is presently limited, and concrete 
evaluations are at this stage not possible. It must be noted that there is an 
underlying intention from the Norwegian authorities that the upgrading has 
“environmentally friendly” as a goal, and during the planning phase of the 
specifics this will be a fundamentally guiding factor.  
 
8 Conclusions and recommendations 
It is the Norwegian Polar Institute's conclusion that the unavoidable environmental 
impacts of the upgrading of Troll and associated activities will be of no more than a 
minor or transitory character. The NPI therefore recommend that the proposed activity 
be implemented as described, under the condition that the activity is conducted in 
accordance with the given framework, that separate environmental impact 
assessments be conducted for the various components that will be instituted, that the 
mitigative measures described in this document are followed, and that an appropriate 
monitoring protocol is prescribed.

Appendix 1: Procedures for fuel storage, transfer and transport 
 
Fuel spills in Antarctica can cause long-lasting environmental damage. The physical conditions in 
Antarctica retard the decomposition of the fuel products, and clean-up efforts are made difficult by the 
conditions as well. 
 
The best strategy is to prevent spills from happening in the first place. This means that any person 
handling fuel in Antarctica has a certain responsibility to ensure that spills do not occur. All expedition 
members should therefore be aware of the guidelines outlined below and act accordingly. 
 
Fuel Storage 
?? Fuel must not be stored in the vicinity of environmentally sensitive areas, i.e. vegetated areas, fresh water, 
bird colonies, etc. 
?? Store all containers, drums, etc. in such a way that any drips, leaks and spills will not enter into the 
environment. An accumulation of such minor releases can easily add up to unnecessary contamination. 
?? Fuel shall only be stored in containers specifically designed for the products being stored, and suitable for the 
prevailing climatic conditions. 
?? Containers must not leak, and must be sealed with a proper fitting lid or cap. 
?? Keep lids, valves, etc. tightly closed except during transfer of fuel.  
 
Transport of fuel 
?? During transport all drums must be transported upright and properly secured to the vehicle to prevent shifting 
or swaying in any manner. All drums should be tied down with adjustable straps to restrict any shifting of the 
load. 
?? Containers of 20 liters or less should be stored in leak proof storage box during transport. This will keep the 
containers from bouncing out of the vehicle and will contain any spillage that may occur from small leaks. 
?? Maintain appropriate spill handling equipment with the transport vehicle. If leaks and spills are noticed, these 
should be stopped and contained immediately. Fuel from leaky or damaged containers should be transferred 
to un-damaged containers or to a safety drum. 
 
Handling & Transfer of fuel 
?? Re-fuelling should as far as possible occur sheltered from the wind. 
?? During fuel transfer absorbent material should always be available. Fuel spills and leaks shall be removed 
with the aid of absorbents and disposed of in an approved manner. 
?? During fuel transfer operations absorbent mats should as far as practicable be used to avoid accidental spills to 
the ground. 
?? All spills and leaks must immediately be contained, cleaned and disposed of in an approved manner according 
to procedures described in the Oil Spill Contingency Plan (OSCP).  
?? Ensure that all spills are to be reported according to the procedures described in OSCP. Spills larger than 200 
liters are to be reported to expedition leader immediately. 
?? All sources of ignition must be eliminated or removed while refueling. 
 
Maintenance & Inspection 
?? Fuel containers should be superficially (visually) checked for leaks and spills by any person having errands in 
the fuel storage area.  
?? All fuel storage drums are to be thoroughly inspected on a weekly basis, and as soon as possible following 
adverse weather. The storage drums and storage area should be checked for leaks, spills, deformed drums, etc. 
Any leakage shall be repaired as quickly as possible.  
 
 
Appendix 2: Fuel spill response guidelines 
 
Initial assessment 
The observer of the spill must carry out an initial assessment of the situation. He/she must check the: 
 
 
1) Probable quantity of fuel spilled 
 
2) Type of fuel 
 
3) Location of the spill 
 
4) Probable source and cause 
5) Risk of fire or harm to human health 
 
Initial notification 
If spill is assessed to be larger than 200 liters the observer of the spill must notify expedition leader and 
communicate the information obtained in the initial assessment. 
 
Response team 
If spill is assessed to be less than 200 liters, observer initiates further response alone or with present 
personnel. Observer should request additional personnel if deemed necessary. 
 
If spill is assessed to be larger than 200 liters, the Expedition Leader must decide on the most appropriate response 
strategy and ensure the presence of adequate personnel to take care of the spill. It is the duty of the selected 
personnel to protect: 
 
1) Health and safety 
2) Station facilities 
3) Threatened resources 
 
 
General clean-up procedures 
Although each oil spill is different, general common procedures are outlined below: 
 
?? Ensure oil spill equipment is in a known and accessible location. 
?? If a spill occurs, stop or minimise any further spillage. Ensure safety of all personnel. Check for fire and 
explosion risk. Ensure safety equipment is worn. 
?? For all spills, deploy absorbents to contain fuel if possible. It may be possible to hold fuel in depressions by 
using absorbent materials, or by building small dams.  
?? If possible use pump to remove fuel from ground straight into 200 liter drums. Ensure that sufficient good 
quality empty drums are available near the spill site. 
?? Put absorbent pads on any remaining fuel or oil outside which cannot be pumped or manually removed. Oil 
soaked absorbents must be picked up and put into plastic bags and/or empty 200 liter drums. 
?? Contaminated snow can be stored in 200 liter drums which have had their tops removed. Allow the snow to 
melt and decant off fuel. 
?? Any waste drums containing a mixture of fuel and snow or water are likely to freeze. To prevent drums from 
splitting, use only those in good conditions. Do not fill completely. 
?? Drums of recovered fuel/water, oil soaked absorbents and contaminated clothing must be sent for disposal 
outside Antarctica. Follow the disposal instructions given in the Nordic Waste Management Handbook. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3: Summary guidelines – Helicopter and aircraft operations  
 
Wildlife 
??Helicopters and small aircraft should not land or fly within 
2000 meters horizontal and 2000 meter vertical separation of 
concentrations (20 or more animals) of birds and seals.  
??When helicopters or aircraft are to be used closer to 
colonies/rookeries than the above stipulated 2000 meters, they 
should preferably not be used during incubation and weaning. 
 
??All helicopters and aircraft should maintain a 300 meter vertical and horizontal separation limit above and 
around whales. 
??If weather conditions make it impossible to maintain the minimum separations, then the flight should be 
postponed if possible. 
??When approaching land, a flight path as low to the horizon as possible should be chosen. Seabirds are more 
alarmed by helicopter and aircraft above them than low to the horizon. 
??Helicopters and small aircraft should always land downwind of wildlife concentrations to minimise 
disturbance due to noise, dust and exhaust fumes.  
??In unfamiliar areas care should always be taken in order to avoid flying over concentrations of wildlife. 
 
Lakes  
??Helicopters and small aircraft should avoid flying over known lakes at altitudes of less than 500 meters or 
operate upwind of lakes, even when frozen, to prevent dust and exhaust fumes from settling on lake surfaces.  
 
Vegetated areas 
??Helicopters and aircraft should not land on, or immediately upwind of, vegetated areas, this in order to avoid 
physical damage to, or dust and exhaust fumes settling on vegetation. 
 
Station Areas 
??See the site specific guidelines pertaining to use of helicopters and aircraft at the Nordic stations  
 
Protected Areas and Managed Areas 
??Most Antarctic Protected and Managed Areas have strict regulations with respect to helicopters and aircraft. 
Before approaching, flying over or landing in a designated Protected or Managed Area, consult the 
management plan for the site in question.  
 
Refueling and Maintenance 
??Scheduled refueling and aircraft maintenance work should whenever possible be undertaken at fixed sites. At 
the Nordic stations these fixed sites are equipped with an absorptive mat or other foundation that will prevent 
large and small spills from reaching the ground. 
??Refueling is not to occur in Protected Areas unless such action is permitted through the management plan. 
??Refueling should not occur near concentrations of wildlife, lakes or vegetated areas unless helicopter or aircraft 
has been permitted to land near such areas in association with approved research. 
??Fuel drums and other equipment must be removed from field sites at the conclusion of the refueling and 
maintenance operations. 
??All helicopters and aircraft are to have the following equipment available in order to clean up spills from the 
refueling/maintenance operations: 
?? absorption mats/pillows 
?? plastic bags to dispose of soiled equipment 
 
 
 
Appendix 4: Waste Management Guidelines 
 
Waste Minimization 
?? Minimize purchase of products with plastic, glass or other bulky packaging 
material. 
?? Buy durable products instead of disposable products. 
?? Get rid of unnecessary packaging material (especially plastic) before leaving for 
Antarctica. 
?? Substitute shredded paper, polystyrene chips, beads and other similar loose 
packaging material with bubble wrap, cardboard or paper. 
?? Buy products that easily can be re-used for other purposes.  
?? Use packaging material that can be re-used. 
?? Re-use products/material whenever this is practicable. 
Waste Removal 
?? No waste is to be disposed of in Antarctica unless special permission has been granted. 
?? No open burning of waste is allowed. 
Environmentally harmful products 
?? Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), non-sterile soil, polystyrene chips/beads and similar forms of packaging 
material, pesticides (except that which is necessary for research or medical/hygienic reasons) are not to be 
brought to Antarctica. 
?? The use of polyvinylchloride (PVC) products is highly discouraged. 
?? The introduction of non-native (non-indigenous) species of animals and plants (including seeds) and any non-
native microorganisms (including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and yeast) requires a special permit. 
?? Products and substances that have a potential harmful environmental effect should be treated with special 
attention so that no emission and dispersal occur. 
Separation of waste 
?? Waste is to be separated into the following categories: 
 
: 
     metal waste 
 
   :      
      glass waste 
   
 
      mixed solid wastes 
 
                      sewage and food waste 
 
 
 
 
Sewage 
?? Discharge of sewage is prohibited under all circumstances unless the project has been granted exemption. 
?? Under no circumstances must sewage or domestic liquid waste be disposed of in vegetated areas or in areas 
with discharge to fresh water. 
Hazardous waste 
?? Different categories of hazardous wastes should never be mixed together in the same drum or crate.   
?? Oil-contaminated soil/water/fabric is to be stored in separate containers (labeled oil polluted 
soil/water/fabric). 
Solids to be combusted 
?? No burning is allowed 
Radioactive waste 
?? For both liquid and solid radioactive waste it is essential that the correct information is provided in the 
labeling of the containers. 
 
liquid kitchen waste/waste water
 
 
Appendix 5: Environmental Guidelines: Flora, fauna and the natural environment 
 
Human activity can have a large impact on the vulnerable natural environment in Antarctica.  Show 
respect, and do your utmost to ensure that your presence does not harm the environment unnecessarily. 
 
Plants  
?? Plants in Antarctica are rare, fragile and grow slowly.  Therefore you should avoid areas where 
mosses and lichens grow.  Use established paths and trails where these exist.   
?? Establish camps in non-sensitive areas   
?? It is prohibited to collect plants without a special permit. 
?? It is prohibited to bring plants to Antarctica. 
 
 
Animals 
?? Keep distance to animals, and be quiet and calm in their presence.  Be especially alert in periods 
when animals breed. Do not walk through bird and seal colonies unless you are conducting 
approved research in the area.  Avoid use of motorised vehicles closer than 200 meters from any 
animal. 
?? Do not feed, touch or handle birds or seals, or approach or photograph them in ways that cause 
them to alter their behaviour.  
?? It is prohibited to collect animals without a special permit 
?? It is prohibited to bring animals to Antarctica 
 
 
Natural environment 
?? Do not paint on rocks or boulders, or in any other manner deface these. 
?? Avoid collecting or taking away geological specimens as a souvenir, including rocks, bones, 
fossils. 
?? When leaving a site it should be left in a natural state.  Go thoroughly through the area before you 
leave, and remove waste and other left behind effects. 
 
 
Protected areas and historic artefacts 
?? Always check whether there are Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA), Antarctic Specially 
Managed Areas (ASMA), Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or registered historic sites and 
monuments in the areas you are staying in. 
?? Special permits are required for entering or engage in activity in ASPAs and SSSIs.  The permit 
must be with you in the field. 
?? Most protected areas have management plans.  It is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with 
and adhere to existing requirements and rules as they are articulated in the management plans. 
?? Cultural remains shall not be damaged, destroyed or removed.
