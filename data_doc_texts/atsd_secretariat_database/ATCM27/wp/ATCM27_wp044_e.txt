DRAFT WORK PROGRAMME 2004/05





















Draft Work Programme 2004/05
Introduction
This Work Programme and the accompanying budget figures are based on the figures in ATCM XXVII-WP029 introduced by Argentina and Australia.   The overall approach has been somewhat modified, however, to take account of the situation of the secretariat in the startup period.  As there is no established practice to rely on, the staffing needs of the secretariat cannot be determined very precisely at this stage.  One other executive staff member seems necessary.  However, instead of fixing the local staff at nine, as proposed in WP029, it seems more advisable to start with six positions and have some functions, e.g. in the areas of software development, technical assistance and translation, performed on a contract basis. 
The Work Programme, which at this stage can only be indicative, is divided into a section on management and a section on the specific tasks assigned to the secretariat in Art. 2 of Measure 1 (2003).  The appropriations of the draft budget for the period 1 September 2004 – 31 March 2005 are in Attachment 1.   Attachment 2 contains the same figures, related to the outputs according to the tasks of the Secretariat as listed in Art. 2 of Measure 1 (2003).  The forecast budget for the full year 2005/06 is contained in Attachment 3, and the contribution scale based on that budget is in Attachment 4.  
Management
Priority for the management in the first half-year will be the recruitment of staff.  
a. Executive staff
The procedure for selecting the Environment Officer will similar to that used in recruiting the Executive Secretary, namely through the contact points of the Consultative Parties, except that applications will be made directly to the Secretariat.  
The Environment Officer will have to have the following qualifications:
- Training and experience as a polar scientist with emphasis on environment-related science
- Practical management experience, e.g. in running (polar) research or logistics programmes
- Fluency in Spanish and experience in the region 
After a first selection based on the dossiers submitted, the top candidates will be asked to present themselves in Buenos Aires for an interview, after which the choice will be made by the Executive Secretary and announced to the Consultative Parties. 
b. Administrative/technical staff		
Recruitment for the six positions listed in the budget will be made locally from nationals of the Consultative Parties, with the assistance of a recruitment agency.  The vacancy notices will be sent to the Consultative Parties for their information.
Specific Tasks
Section headings refer to the paragraphs of Art. 2 of	Measure 1 (2003)	
(a) Preparation for the XXVIII ATCM and CEP VI
The secretariat will assume the responsibility for preparing the agenda and gathering and collating the working and information papers for the XXVIII ATCM and publishing them on the restricted area of the ATS website.  The website, which is at the moment still in the experimental stage, will be improved and expanded.  During the ATCM/CEP, the Secretariat will, in co-operation with the host government, provide the necessary secretariat services for the meeting.  During the period of provisional application of Measure 1 (2003), the budget will not include the full translation and interpretation expenses for the ATCM/CEP meeting, but the Secretariat will assist the Swedish Government in arranging these services.  The Secretariat will also assume responsibility for the editing and publication of the Final Report of the XVIII ATCM. 	
(b) Support intersessional work of the ATCM and the CEP
The secretariat will provide support in the organisation of any intersessional meetings.  If interpretation would be needed for meetings such as possible intersessional negotiations of the Liability Annex, provision will have to be made in the budget.   		
(c) Facilitate exchange of information required under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol
The secretariat will support work to improve the efficiency and transparency of the exchange of information among the Consultative Parties as required under the Antarctic Treaty and the Environment Protocol.  In the set-up of the Secretariat databases and website, provision will be made for facilities for the exchange of information through the website. 	
(d) Co-ordination and contact with other elements of the Antarctic Treaty system
 The Executive Secretary will attend meetings such as SCAR/COMNAP, CCAMLR, IAATO and other relevant organisations.  Liaison with the CCAMLR secretariat will be particularly important in the start-up period, as many of the arrangements and regulations of the secretariat have been made according to the example and experience provided by 
CCAMLR.
(e) Development and maintenance of databases
A high priority in this area is to set up a database of the contact points under the Antarctic Treaty and the Environment Protocol, to improve the efficiency of communication.  Another is the completion of the existing database of ATCM recommendations, to make it available on the Secretariat website, and to expand it to include a) where applicable, documents in all four official languages of the Treaty, and b) Working Papers and Information Papers of the ATCM.  The secretariat will provide support for other databases that the ATCM might decide to set up such as a database on tourism.  		
(f) Circulation amongst the Parties relevant information and disseminate information on activities in Antarctica; 
The Secretariat and its website will function as a clearinghouse for information on the Parties’ activities and relevant developments in Antarctica.  It will include links to all other relevant websites.  Information will be circulated also through newsletters etc. 
(g) Collection, maintenance and publication of ATCM/CEP records
Consultative Parties that have hosted ATCM’s will be asked as a matter of urgency to provide the Secretariat with authentic copies of all reports of the ATCM’s and other meetings they have hosted, so that the Secretariat will become a complete and reliable repository of the documents of the ATCM.  The documents will be digitised and made available through the databases mentioned above, and through the Secretariat website.		
(h) Facilitate the availability of information about the Antarctic Treaty system
The Secretariat will seek to improve the visibility of the Antarctic Treaty System through its website, through newsletters and pamphlets, and through other publicity activities.	
(i) Preparation of reports on the Secretariat’s activities
Under this heading falls the task of preparing the reports and budgets of the Secretariat.  In principle the Secretariat will prepare half-yearly financial and programmatic reports for the ATCM.	
(j) Assisting the review of past Recommendations and Measures
The examination and review of past Recommendations and Measures of the ATCM, which is at present focusing on the Protected Area System, will be assisted by the Secretariat, so as to produce well-prepared working papers and information papers for ATCM XXVIII.	
(k) Maintenance and updating of the Antarctic Treaty System “Handbook”		
A start will be made with the preparation of next editions of the Handbook prepared until now by the Depositary Government.  Different possibilities (separate handbooks focusing on different subjects, web-based expert systems, etc.) will be considered.
