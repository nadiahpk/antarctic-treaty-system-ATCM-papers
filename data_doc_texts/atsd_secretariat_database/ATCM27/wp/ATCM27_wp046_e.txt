MEASURE .. (2004)


Insurance Cover for the Costs of Search and Rescue, Medical Care and Evacuation from Antarctica in the Case of Tourist and Other Non-Governmental Activities


The Representatives,

Recalling the Antarctic Treaty, the Protocol on Environmental Protection and Recommendation I of the XVIII ATCM on Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities;

Recognising the need to ensure self-sufficiency and safe operations by those conducting tourist and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica and the need to avoid the imposition of costs on national programmes;

Noting that the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in Antarctica recommended insurance for non-governmental expeditions and that all Consultative Parties should require proof of adequate insurance for such expeditions;

Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty:

	
That all natural and legal persons under their jurisdiction or control who are responsible for a proposed tourist or other non-governmental activity in Antarctica be required to provide evidence that they have obtained sufficient insurance to meet the costs of search and rescue and medical care and evacuation from Antarctica, as well as evidence of a contractual arrangement for back-up and contingency support. Compliance with these conditions shall be required before any determination is made that the proposed activity may proceed.
