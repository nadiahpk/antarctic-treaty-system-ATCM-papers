ANTARCTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT: SUGGESTED BUDGET AND WORK PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST OPERATING YEAR












antarctic treaty secretariat: SUGGESTED budget and work program for the first OPERATING year

    1. In this paper Argentina and Australia propose a budget and work plan for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat for its first year of operation. It draws on the draft budget provided in the discussions at XXVI ATCM.

    2. In the proposed budget, the figures shown as ‘Indicative Estimate’ are those used at XXVI ATCM to provide an estimate for the calculation of an initial scale of contributions, as indicated in Appendix 2 of the final report of that meeting.
    3. Income has been calculated on the basis of informal advice received from the United States, in its capacity as Depositary Government, of voluntary contributions made by Consultative Parties in accordance with Decision 2 (2003).
    4. Parties will note that the estimated expenditure for the first operating year is significantly below the indicative estimate.  This is because the proposed first year budget does not include costs for translation and interpretation services in support of XXVIII ATCM.  It is expected that such costs will continue to be met by Host Governments until Measure 1 (2003) is approved by all Consultative Parties.
    5. The proposed budget is accompanied by more detailed explanatory notes and a proposed work plan for the first year of the Secretariat’s operations.

Explanatory notes on the proposed budget

    1. The proposed budget has been prepared in the absence of an approved work program for the Secretariat’s first year.  It is expected that after appointment the Executive Secretary will develop a work program commensurate with the proposed budget.  A suggested work program for the Secretariat’s first year is attached at Appendix A for consideration by ATCM.
Salaries
    2. Salaries paid to staff during the first operating year are based on Schedules A and  B to the Staff Regulations1  as follows:
Executive Secretary (Schedule A)			Level 1B, step 1
Environmental Officer (Schedule A)		Level 3B, step 1
Finance Manager, Data Manager (Schedule B)		Level 1, step 1
Documentation Officer (Schedule B)		Level 2, step 1
Translators (Schedule B)		Level 3, step 1
Computer & Admin. Assistants (Schedule B)	Level 5, step 1
    3. Discussion may be required at ATCM to determine if all these positions are required in the Secretariat’s first year of operation.  Also, as recruitment action may take some time it is not anticipated that the total allocation of funds for salaries will be expended in the first operating year.  However, a full year’s allocation has been provided to enable the Executive Secretary to employ short-term casual labour as appropriate.
Office equipment
    4. The budget has been prepared on the basis that computers and other office equipment will be leased.  This will reduce fluctuations in the Secretariat’s budget due to one-off capital equipment purchases and should ensure that the Secretariat has efficient equipment.  Costs have been based on CCAMLR experience which equates to approximately USD 2,000 per person per year.  It is expected that there will be one-off costs for the initial establishment of shared infrastructure such as networking facilities and servers. The proposed budget provides USD 20,000 this purpose.  USD 39,070 is suggested for the initial purchase of software.
ATCM translation and interpretation costs
    5. Costs for translation and interpretation services have not been included in the budget as it is expected that these costs will continue to be met by Host Governments until Measure 1 (2003) is approved by all Consultative Parties.
Travel 
    6. The budget for travel provides for the Secretariat’s staff to support ATCM XXVIII in Sweden, on the basis of 10 staff members participating for a period of three weeks.  As the flight from Buenos Aires to Stockholm will exceed nine hours flying time staff will be entitled to fly business class, in accordance with staff regulation 9.3.  The allocation for fares has been increased accordingly.  Funding is also provided for three additional overseas trips for consultations with the host government (involving two staff members at three days for each visit).  
    7. An allocation has also been included for the Executive Secretary to attend up to three other international meetings per years.  Costs are based on an airfare of up to USD 3,600 and allowances of USD 200 per day for 14 days per trip.   
Support costs
    8. The budget for miscellaneous items covers library books and periodicals, bank fees, representation expenses for the Executive Secretary, incidental costs of meetings and other minor costs not covered under other items of expenditure.
    9. An indicative amount of USD 20,000 has been included in the budget for relocation expenses for staff employed in the executive category.
