Working Paper on Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica






















Working Paper on
Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica





    1. INTRODUCTION

Fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter operations are now integral to most national Antarctic research programmes, as well as being used by a small number of commercial tourist and air transport companies.  The potential for harmful disturbance to concentrations of birds makes it important to provide pilots with guidelines that would prevent or minimize damaging impacts during overflights.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of definitive scientific data on which to base firm guidelines for pilots.  Moreover, most of the available research relates to penguins and different species of birds are likely to react in different ways or to different degrees to overflights.  


    2. BACKGROUND

The United Kingdom introduced Working Paper ATCM XXV / WP-26 at ATCM XXV in Warsaw (2002) to bring the issue to the attention of Treaty Parties and to propose a particular set of guidelines.  The CEP invited COMNAP, in consultation with SCAR, to review the guidelines, and to report back to the CEP.  The present paper presents our conclusions and a recommended set of guidelines.  Pending further scientific evidence, these guidelines are considered to constitute a reasonable basis for voluntary implementation.  They are based on the practical experience of researchers, including input from SCAR, and on experience derived from the national operators’ provision of logistics support to researchers.  These guidelines are designed to help aircraft operations in Antarctica to be undertaken safely with the minimal environmental impact.  

COMNAP recommends that aircraft operations in Antarctica should be planned and carried out in accordance with these guidelines to the maximum extent practicable.  
3.	GUIDELINES


Minimum Distances for Aircraft Operations Close to Concentrations of Birds

There are many variables in noise levels received on the ground during aircraft operations. Determining factors on noise levels include flight height, the type of aircraft and engine, the flight profile, the weather and the location.  Pilots will need to make their own judgements based on the aircraft type, task and operational safety considerations. 

Unless otherwise specified, for example by an ASPA management plan or ASMA guidelines, recommended distances are set out below.  It is recognised however that whilst these represent preferred distances, which should be adhered to the extent possible, operators may already have developed guidelines to suit their own particular needs and circumstances. 

    • Penguin, albatross and other bird colonies are not to be overflown below 2000ft (~ 610 m) Above Ground Level, except when operationally necessary.

    • Landings within ½ nautical mile (~ 930 m) of penguin, albatross or other bird colonies should be avoided wherever possible.

    • Never hover or make repeated passes over wildlife concentrations or fly lower than necessary. 

    • Maintain a vertical separation distance of 2000 ft (~ 610 m) AGL and a horizontal separation of 1/4 nautical mile (~ 460 m) from the coastline where possible. 

    • Cross coasts at right angles and above 2000ft (~610 m) AGL where possible. 


Location of aircraft operations (other considerations)
    • Be aware that concentrations of birds are most often found in coastal areas. 
    • Be aware that when operating aircraft in inland areas, snow and Antarctic petrel colonies are frequently found on nunataks.  Minimum over-flight distance should be maintained in such areas.
    • Where practical, landings near to concentrations of birds should be downwind and/or behind a prominent physical barrier (e.g. hill) to minimise disturbance.
    • Avoid Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, unless authorised to over-fly and/or land by a permit issued by an appropriate national authority. For many ASPAs there are specific controls on aircraft operations, which are set out in the relevant Management Plans.
    • Follow aircraft flight heights, preferred flight paths and approach paths contained in the Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM), in station aircraft operation manuals and on relevant charts and maps. Once the guidelines have been adopted, COMNAP envisages the preparation of Wild Life and Low Flying Avoidance Maps for the major airstrips in the Antarctic (e.g. Marsh, Marambio, Rothera, Mc Murdo). 
    • Particularly avoid flying toward concentrations of birds immediately after take-off and avoid steep banking turns in flight as these significantly increase the amount of noise generated.


Timing of aircraft operations
    • Most native bird species breed at coastal locations in Antarctica between October and April each season. During the planning of aircraft operations near to concentrations of birds, consideration should be given to undertaking flying activities outside of the main breeding and/or moulting periods.
    • Where aircraft operations are necessary close to concentrations of birds, then the duration of flights should be the minimum necessary.
    • To minimise bird strikes, especially in coastal areas, avoid flying after dark between October and April. At this time of year, prions and petrels are active. These birds are nocturnal when breeding and are attracted by lights.
    • Aircraft operations should be delayed or cancelled if weather conditions (e.g. cloud base, winds) are such that the suggested minimum vertical and horizontal separation distances given in these guidelines cannot be maintained.
