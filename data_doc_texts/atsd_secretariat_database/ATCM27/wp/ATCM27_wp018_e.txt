Report of the Intersessional Contact Group
Introduction

    1. In Madrid, the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP VI, September 2003) examined a certain number of new and revised management plans for the Antarctic protected areas.
    2. The Committee for Environmental Protection established four intersessional contact groups (ICGs) charged to revise the management plans. They were led by a representative of the State Party who had introduced the management plan (paragraphs 130-135 of the CEP’s Final Report).
    3. France introduced a revised draft management plan during CEP VI (paragraph 131).
    4. In accordance with Article 6-3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection, the management plan is to be reviewed at least once every five years and updated as appropriate.
Method used
    5. The management plan’s contents have been reorganized according to provisions laid out in Article 5-3 of Annex V to the Protocol.
    6. Mr. Thierry Micol (thierry.micol@taaf.fr) was appointed coordinator for the ICG. The contact group worked along the lines provided for in paragraph 9 of the CEP I Report.
    7. On February 20, 2004, the revised management plan has been submitted to the Parties, for appraisal, through the CEP’s contact points. Comments were received until March 21, 2004. The final draft management plan encompassing those comments was again submitted to the members for appraisal from March 25 to April 5, 2004.
    8. The terms of reference as established by the CEP and contained in paragraph 8 of Annex 4, Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans (CEP VI Report) were used to examine the management plan.

Comments received regarding the draft management plan introduced at CEP VI.

    9. Only the United Kingdom forwarded comments on the first draft.

    10. The United Kingdom requested that some points of clarification be added to the text:


    • what has been the impact of the 335 tourists at Dumont d’Urville station during the past five years?
“preventing disturbance in the area due to the growing number of cruising ships: although the 335 registered tourists visiting the Dumont d’Urville station over the past five years have caused no visible impact on the environment, especially on the avifauna, stringent protection measures must be taken.”
    • how was the sensitivity of species mentioned in Table 3 established?
Reference to Micol & Jouventin has now been provided.

    11. The United Kingdom has also suggested formal amendments that have all been taken into account in the final document.

Conclusion
    12. As no other comments to this final version have been received, the Intersessional Contact Group suggests that the CEP submits to the ATCM the enclosed Annex entitled “Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 120, Pointe Géologie archipelago (Jean Rostand, Le Mauguen (former Alexis Carrel), Lamarck and Claude Bernard islands, The Good Doctor’s Nunatak and breeding site of Emperor penguins)” and recommends that it be adopted.

UPDATED MANAGEMENT PLAN


1. Description of values to be protected

In 1995, four islands, a nunatak and a breeding ground for emperor penguins have been classified as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (Measure 3, XIX ATCM, Seoul) because they were a representative example of terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems from a biological, geolgical and aesthetics perspective. A species of marine mammal, the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) and various species of birds breed in the area: emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri); Antarctic skua (Catharacta maccormicki); Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae); Wilson’s Petrel  (Oceanites oceanicus); giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteus); Snow petrel (Pagodrama nivea), Cape petrel (Daption capense).

Well-marked hills display asymmetrical transverse profiles with gently dipping northern slopes compared to the steeper southern ones. The terrain is affected by numerous cracks and fractures leading to very rough surfaces. The basement rocks mainly consist of sillimanite, cordierite and garnet-rich gneisses which are intruded by abundant dikes of pink anatexites. The lowest parts of the islands are covered by morainic boulders (from a few centimetres to more than a metre across). 

Long-term research and monitoring programs of birds and marine mammals have been going on for a long time already (since 1952 or 1964 according to the species). A database implemented in 1981 is directed by  the Centre d'Etudes biologiques de Chize (CEBC-CNRS). Human scientific presence may be estimated at around 4 people for a few hours, twice a month in the protected area.
Among the approximately 30 emperor penguin breeding sites on record, this is the only one located close to a permanent station. It is therefore a providential spot to study this species and its environment.

2. Aims and Objectives 

Management of the Pointe Géologie Specially Protected Area aims at: 

    • preventing disturbance in the area due to the proximity of the station;
    • preventing disturbance in the area due to the growing number of cruising ships: although the 335 registered tourists visiting the Dumont d’Urville station over the past five years have caused no visible impact on the environment, especially on the avifauna, stringent protection measures must be taken.
    • allowing research of a compelling scientific nature which cannot be carried out elsewhere; 
    • avoiding any major changes to the structure and composition of flora and fauna and the association of different species of vertebrates harbored in the area, which is one of the most representative for both faunistic and scientific interest on Adélie Coast; 
    • permit research on ethological, ecological, physiological and biochemical programs in progress, especially those related to demographic monitoring and impact assessment of surrounding human activities, including tourism;
    • permit research in geology with particular attention to the scheduling of visits when thermo-mechanical sampling means are required. 

3. Management Activities 

The Plan is kept under periodical review to ensure that the values of the Antarctic Specially Protected Area are wholly protected. Any activity carried out in the area undergoes an environmental impact assessment before being undertaken. 

4. Period of Designation 

The Area remains an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) for an indefinite period. 

5. Description of the Area 

(i) Geographic coordinates, boundary markers and natural features 

The Jean Rostand, Le Mauguen (formerly Alexis Carrel), Lamarck and Claude Bernard islands, the ‘Bon Docteur’ Nunatak and the Emperor penguins breeding colony are located in the heart of the Pointe-Géologie Archipelago, coastal area of Adélie Coast (140° ‑ 140°02'E - 66°39'30" - 66°40'30"S;).

The area consists of the southernmost rock outcrops of Pointe-Géologie Archipelago, between Petrel Island and the western edge of Astrolabe Glacier. It is a very large ice-free ground on Adélie Coast. 
As a whole, the surface of the rock outcrops does not exceed 2 km2. The highest points are distributed along north-east-south-west ridges (C. Bernard Island: 47.6 m; J Rostand Island 36.39 m; Le Mauguen (formerly Alexis Carrel) Island: 28.24 m Nunatak: 28.50 m). 

During the summer, only the Southern flanks of the islands are still covered by firns. 

The area has clear natural boundary markers. However, markers will be set up in the Nunatak at a later stage. 

No tracks or roads exist in the area. 


 (ii) Identification of restricted or prohibited zones 

Access to every part of the area is prohibited unless authorized by a permit. 

Location of breeding colonies is shown on the map. Birds are present from October to March, but for the emperor penguins, which breed in winter (Table 2). Their sensitivity to human disturbance varies depending on the species (Table 3). The establishment of the Dumont d'Urville station has resulted in a drastic decrease of the populations of emperor penguins and southern giant petrels in Pointe-Géologie Archipelago. Conversely, the significant decrease of emperor penguins by the end of the 1970s seems to have been due to long weather anomalies between 1976 and 1982. Since 1995, the breeding areas of these two species have been protected and the populations are now stable (Table 3). No one, except permit holders, is allowed to approach or to disturb the Emperor penguin colony in any manner when eggs during the breeding season, from April to mid-December when the chicks fledge. 


The particularly sensitive Emperor penguins are also to be protected beyond the boundaries of the breeding area since the colony is not always located on the same spot. 

The south-eastern part of Jean Rostand Island is designated as a restricted area in order to preserve the remaining breeding colony of Southern giant petrels. All access to this restricted area is strictly prohibited during the breeding period, from August to February. The access is restricted to one ornithologist holding a permit to the extent spelled out in the present paragraph, i.e. once a year when chicks are being banded, for the purposes of monitoring the population. The boundary of the restricted area is defined by the NE-SW ridge going through the 33.10 m and 36.39 m marks Norrth West of the colony, marked on the floor with stakes. This condition shall be for an indefinite period, but it may be subject to re-evaluation every time the Management Plan is reviewed. 

 (iii) Location of structures in the Area 

Provost hut and a shelter are located on Rostand Island. There are no other buildings anywhere else in the Area. 

6. Maps

The Pointe-Géologie Archipelago map shows with dotted lines the boundaries of the Antarctic Specially Protected Area inside the archipelago. 




7. Conditions under which Permits may be granted 

7 (i) Access to and movement within the Area 

No helicopters, nor terrestrial vehicles are authorized within the Area. No overflights over the Area, either by helicopters or other airplanes are authorized. Access to the area is therefore only permitted by foot or by zodiacs (in summer). However, very rare departures of terrestrial vehicles from Bon Docteur Nunatak are allowed, but only when sea-ice conditions hinder from proceeding otherwise and with special attention to the presence of birds in the area. Access to and movement within the area shall, in any case, be limited in order to avoid unnecessary disturbance to birds, especially by crossing their pathways and to ensure that breeding areas or their access are not damaged or endangered. 




7 (ii) Activities which are or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place 

    • compelling scientific activities which cannot be conducted elsewhere and essential management activities provided special care is provided for both the emperor penguins and the restricted area Southern giant petrels (see para 6.ii).
    • visitors granted access to the Area by a permit shall ensure that their visit will cause no disturbances to the monitoring programs under way. 

(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures 

No structures are to be erected or scientific equipment installed in the area except for compelling scientific reasons or management activities as authorized by the competent authorities in the framework of the urbanistic and domaniality regulations in force. 


(iv) The location of field camps 

Only safety tents should be erected when security reasons so require it provided all precautions have been taken in order to avoid damaging or disturbing the fauna. 

7 (v) Restriction on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area 

    • according to the provisions set forth in Annex II of the Madrid Protocol, no living animals or plant materials, poultry products, including dried eggs, shall be introduced into the Area; 
    • no chemicals shall be brought into the Area, except chemicals which may be introduced for a compelling scientific purpose as specified in the permit. Any chemical introduced shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the permit was granted; 
    • fuel, food and other materials are not to be stored in the area, unless required for compelling purposes connected with the activity for which the permit has been granted. Such materials are to be removed when no longer required. Permanent storage is not permitted. 

(vi) The taking of or harmful interference with flora and fauna 

Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna is prohibited except in accordance with a permit. 2.	If an activity is determined as having less than a minor or transitory impact, it should be carried out in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica, as a minimum standard. 
7 (vii) The collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the permit holder 
Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by a permit holder is prohibited unless specified in the permit for scientific or management purposes. 

However, debris of manmade origin may be removed from the area and dead or pathological specimens of fauna or flora may be removed for laboratory examination. 

(viii) The disposal of waste 

All waste produced, except for waste water, must be removed from the Area. 

(ix) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met 

Visits to the Area shall be restricted to scientific and management objectives only. 

(x) Requirements for reports of visits to the Area 

Parties should ensure that the principal holder of each permit issued submit to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR. Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the management plan. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit original or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both in any review of the management plan and in organizing the scientific use of the Area.
