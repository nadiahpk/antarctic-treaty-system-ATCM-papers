BUDGET AND FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE
SECRETARIAT OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Attached to this working paper is a draft Decision for the adoption of a budget for the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty (the Secretariat).  The Decision also addresses other financial considerations relating to the efficient operation of the Secretariat.

The draft budget annexed to the Decision has been prepared by the Executive Secretary and covers the period 1 September 2004 to 31 March 2005. 

As the 2005/06 will not be approved by ATCM until its next meeting there will be a period following the completion of the 2004/05 financial year when the Secretariat will not have an approved budget.  To provide funds for this period it is proposed that ATCM approve an allocation of one quarter of the Forecast Budget for 2005/06, a draft of which is annexed to the Decision.    

Parties’ contributions for the 2004/05 financial year have been provided on the basis that the Secretariat will operate for a full year.  As the Secretariat will not commence operating until the Executive Secretary takes up his appointment on 1 September 2004 there will be a significant surplus for the 2004/05 financial year.  It is proposed that this surplus and any other surpluses accrued until Measure 1 (2003) is approved, be credited to a Special Fund titled the ‘Interim Adjustment Fund’.  This fund would be established in accordance with Financial Regulation 6.2(d).  The fund would be used for costs related to the establishment of the Secretariat.  Expenditure from this fund would be at the direction of the ATCM. 

Decision 2 (2003) adopted a procedure for the payment of voluntary contributions by Consultative Parties until Measure 1 (2003) becomes effective.  It is proposed that the Executive Secretary assumes the role taken by the Depositary Government in this procedure now that the Executive Secretary has been appointed.
