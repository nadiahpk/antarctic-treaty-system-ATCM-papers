MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF ACTIVITIES: APPROACHES TAKEN BY THE ANTARCTIC SITE INVENTORY






























MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF ACTIVITIES:
Approaches Taken by the Antarctic Site Inventory
(Submitted by the United States)



Introduction
Pursuant to Decision 5 of ATCM XXVI (2003), an Antarctic Treaty Meeting Of Experts (ATME) convened in Norway, 22-25 March 2004, to consider issues relating to tourism and nongovernmental activities in Antarctica. With respect to monitoring, cumulative impact, and environmental impact assessment, the ATME agreed that: 
the CEP should address the issue of monitoring and provide the ATCM with recommendations for the coordinated monitoring of activities in Antarctica including the establishment of a consistent methodology and central data collection process.
The ATME Final Report noted the requirement of Article 3 of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (“the Protocol”) to assess and monitor the impacts of ongoing activities and, specifically, referenced the data collection efforts of Oceanites and the Antarctic Site Inventory project.1
To ensure that CEP may fully examine the data collection efforts of Oceanites and the Antarctic Site Inventory in its consideration of monitoring, this paper describes:
    1. Background information relating to the Antarctic Site Inventory project and its methodology;
    2. Established assessment and monitoring authorities that guided the choice of methodology for the Inventory;
    3. Components of the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem examined by the Inventory in choosing indicator species to monitor;
    4. Relevant, variable data sets the Inventory collects in regard to these indicator species (particularly, population size and breeding success); and 
    5. Site selection criteria for a coordinated monitoring program.

Background relating to the Antarctic Site Inventory project
In ten seasons of fieldwork, beginning in November 1994, the Antarctic Site Inventory has demonstrated an ability to reach Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites frequently and cost-effectively. Through February 2004, Inventory researchers have made 570 visits to 89 Peninsula locations. Using opportunistic visits on expedition vessels operating in the Peninsula during the austral spring and summer, and, occasionally, the UK ice patrol vessel, HMS Endurance, Inventory researchers have made repetitive visits to all of the visitor sites that are most heavily visited by expedition tourists, and to all sites which exhibit the most species diversity and which are most prone to potential environmental disturbance from human visitors (Naveen, et. al, 2000, 2001; Naveen, 1996, 1997a, 1997b, 2003). The Inventory also has demonstrated clearly that well-timed visits by its trained researchers are a resourceful means for characterizing these sites and collecting baseline biological data (Naveen, et. al, 2000, 2001; Naveen, 1996, 1997a, 1997b, 2003). In November 2003, the Inventory began a focused assessment and monitoring program at Petermann Island (65°10’S, 64°10’), a heavily visited Peninsula location.
The Inventory study area covers all parts of the Antarctic Peninsula reached by the shipborne tourism industry. The Inventory divides the Peninsula into six subareas — South Orkney Islands, including Laurie, Coronation, and Signy Islands (SO); Elephant Island and nearby islands (EI); Northeast Antarctic Peninsula/northwestern Weddell Sea (NE), from Cape Dubouzet (63°16’S 64°00’W) to James Ross Island; South Shetland Islands, including Deception, Low, and Smith Islands (SH); Northwest Antarctic Peninsula (NW), from Cape Dubouzet (63°16’S, 64°00’W) to north end of the Lemaire Channel; and Southwest Antarctic Peninsula (SW), from the north end of the Lemaire Channel to the northern part of Marguerite Bay (68°18’S 67°11’W).
At the various sites, the Inventory routinely collects: 
    • Basic Site Information, which includes descriptions of key physical and topographical characteristics; latitude and longitude; distribution of flora, seal haul-out and wallow locations, and discrete groups of breeding penguins and flying birds; 
    • Variable Site Information and Data, which includes weather and other environmental conditions (sea ice extent, cloud cover, snow cover, temperature, wind direction and speed), biological variables (number of occupied nests, number of chicks per occupied nest, ages of chicks), and the nature and extent of any observed visitor impacts (footprints or paths, cigarette butts, film canisters, and litter); and 
    • Maps and Photodocumentation, which portray the major features of each site, particularly the locations of colonies and assemblages of resident fauna and flora.2

Established authorities with respect to assessment and monitoring
Data collected by the Inventory are intended to assist the implementation of the Protocol, which, among other things, requires a priori environmental impact assessments for all human activities, including tourism, and for monitoring to be done, as and when necessary, to assess and verify predicted environmental impacts. Article 3 of the Protocol specifically recognizes the important role of monitoring in the long-term conservation of Antarctica. 
Established assessment and monitoring authorities guided the choice of methodology for the Inventory. These authorities emphasize that environmental assessment and monitoring regimes should be able to identify changes to the baseline reference state at particular locations; it is also recognized that any detected changes may be naturally occurring, produced perhaps by human activities, or may result from other direct, consequential, synergistic, and cumulative effects. Potential impacts may be short-term or long-term, immediate or cumulative. In the case of biological populations, the focus should be detecting and understanding changes that may occur to these populations as a whole. (Benninghoff and Bonner, 1985; Abbott and Benninghoff, 1990; SCAR, 2004; Trivelpiece, 1991; Emslie, 1997; Hofman and Jatko, 2002)
These authorities suggest that assessment and monitoring efforts should:
    • Identify the types of activities that could possibly have unacceptable effects on Antarctic ecosystems and the likely nature of those effects;
    • Determine those components of Antarctic ecosystems that are most likely to be affected in unacceptable ways by human activities;
    • Select possible indicator variables and areas to monitor; and, ultimately
    • Ensure that activities cause no unacceptable deterioration of values or resources.

Taking cues from the literature (Trivelpiece, 1991; Emslie, 1997; Croxall and Kirkwood, 1979; Woehler, 1993; Woehler and Croxall, 1996), the Inventory has focused on censusing four penguin species  — gentoo, Adélie, chinstrap, and macaroni, and these species of flying birds — blue-eyed shag, southern giant petrel, kelp gull, and Antarctic brown and south polar skuas. Scree-nesting seabirds (storm-petrels, spp.; Antarctic fulmars; Antarctic petrels; snow petrels) were considered too difficult to census regularly because these species’ nests are generally inaccessible and, at times, difficult to discover. Antarctic terns presented a different problem: nesting territories were readily ascertained, but censusing is difficult because of this species’ extraordinary skittishness, and the camouflage of its eggs and young. As a consequence, Inventory researchers note Antarctic tern breeding grounds in field data and orientation maps, but do not expend time trying to achieve censuses.
Regarding penguins, differences in breeding biology led to different Inventory census strategies (Trivelpiece, 1991; Williams, 1995; Emslie, 1997). Chinstrap and Adélie penguins are site-specific animals, which do not tend to abandon regular nest sites and rookeries if there is a breeding failure in a single season. Gentoo penguins, by contrast, are not as site-tenacious and gentoo-pairs regularly change nesting locations if there are disturbances. The implications for Inventory-like projects are that: gentoo censuses only may have long-term relevance if all gentoos at a particular visitor sites are counted, including all subgroups and small colonies of gentoos found at that site; and censuses of chinstraps and Adélies may have long-term relevance even if all chinstraps or Adélies at a particular location cannot be counted.
Although the Inventory regularly censuses blue-eyed shags, southern giant petrels, kelp gulls, and skuas, censusing these seabirds presents a number of practical challenges. For example, kelp gulls and skuas readily take flight on close approaches and, thus, Inventory personnel give them a wide berth, confining notes and data to the location of nests, numbers of adults tending nests, and numbers of chicks observed at a distance. Southern giant petrels are particularly difficult to census, being perhaps the most skittish of these flying birds. The standard modus operandii for Inventory researchers is to walk the far perimeter of southern giant petrel nesting areas to reduce potential disturbances to an absolute minimum.
With respect to seals, data collection is necessarily confined to censusing numbers of southern elephant seals that gather regularly in wallows at particular visitor sites. 
With respect to floral communities, Inventory researchers record the presence of lichens, mosses, Deschampsia, and Colobanthus, and there is an effort to photodocument as much of this vegetation as possible on a site-by-site basis. 

Data regarding indicator species
From the outset, Inventory data collection has followed Standard Methods established by the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (“CEMP”) (Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, 2004). This ensures that data sets are fully comparable to data collected by other Antarctic researchers, and that these data contribute to a better understanding of biological processes in the Antarctic Peninsula and to determinations whether any detected changes are site-specific aberrations or Peninsula-wide trends. Data also are collected with reference to other pertinent authorities, in particular, The Distribution of Penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula and Islands of the Scotia Sea (Croxall and Kirkwood, 1979) and The Distribution and Abundance of Antarctic and Subantarctic Penguins (Woehler, 1993).
With respect to penguins, data collection focuses on breeding population size (nest counts) and breeding success (number of chicks produced per occupied nest), which, under the CEMP Standard Methods, are the appropriate parameters for ascertaining whether biological populations are being impacted directly or cumulatively. With respect to blue-eyed shags, Inventory data collection follows similar methodologies, though, at present, there are no CEMP Standard Method specifically pertaining to blue-eyed shags.
CEMP Standard Method A3A (v4) is utilized to estimate breeding population size and determine interannual trends in the size of breeding populations. A decline in a breeding population would be one indication that a penguin population at a particular site is being impacted. The total number of birds engaged in breeding activity can be influenced by: cohort size at fledging and rate of recruitment of each cohort to the breeding population; food supply during pre-laying and incubation periods; ages of individual birds (and consequently the age structure of colony); previous breeding experience of the individuals; the length of mate-bond; presence of mate; size and location of colony; and ice conditions prior to colony occupation. The methodology notes the importance of fixing counting methods over successive years to maintain consistent levels of disturbance, and emphasizes that the colonies selected for this method are repeatedly used in successive years.
CCAMLR Standard Method A6 (v5), Procedure A is utilized to estimate breeding success and to assess productivity by providing an index of relative change in the number of chicks produced one year to the next. A decline in the number of chicks produced per occupied nest would be one indication that a penguin population at a particular site is being impacted. The census colonies must be well defined, distributed in various parts of the study area, and clearly marked and mapped. It is important that the same colonies be counted annually, and should be the same as those used to assess breeding population size. Breeding success will be indicative of many factors, notably adult condition and colony size, food availability, predator pressure, ice conditions and other environmental features. The success of breeding expressed both as total number of chicks raised and number of chicks raised per adult will have important implications for future population size. Season-to-season variation in breeding success can be considerable.

Site selection criteria for a coordinated monitoring program
The recent report, Assessment of the Possible Cumulative Environmental Impacts of Commercial Ship-Based Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula Area (Hofman and Jatko, 2002), notes that long-term studies are likely necessary to detect any possible cumulative impacts of ship-based tourism, and that it would be impractical and prohibitively costly to attempt to characterize and monitor every site in the Peninsula area that is or may be subject to visits by shipborne tourists. It is emphasized that observations at a series of comparable sites along a gradient with different types and levels of tourist activities, and/or observations at a series of comparable sites subjected internationally to different types and levels of tourist activities, are likely necessary to distinguish any cumulative environmental impacts possibly resulting from tourist activities from those caused by other factors.
In these regards, the Antarctic Site Inventory has produced a vast amount of data and information regarding Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites, which are compiled in the Compendium of Antarctic Peninsula Visitor Sites, 2d edition: A Report To The United States Environmental Protection Agency (2003). For example, the Compendium notes which of the 245 Antarctic Peninsula visitor locations experience the most number of tourist zodiac landings, which of these sites are the most diverse in species composition, which of these sites are the most sensitive to potential disruptions from visitors, and which of these sites have the most restricted visitor space.3 Attachment 1 to this paper, based on data and information in the Compendium, lists the 25 Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites that experienced the most number of zodiac landings during the 14-year period 1989-2003, and each site’s ranking with respect to species diversity, sensitivity to potential disruptions from visitors, and whether or not the site has restricted visitor space.
In selecting sites for a coordinated monitoring program, the Compendium usefully notes that, despite a large number of Peninsula visitor sites (245), zodiac landings by tourists concentrate at relatively few sites. In the 14-year period, 1989-2004, the ten sites experiencing the most number of zodiac landings each season account for more than 50% of that season’s zodiac landings and visitors participating in such zodiac landings; the fifteen sites experiencing the most number of zodiac landings each season account for 65-80% of that season’s zodiac landings and participating visitors; and the twenty sites experiencing the most number of zodiac landings each season” sites account for 73-93% of that season’s zodiac landings and visitors.
Because the project has relied on opportunistic travel via expedition ships and the UK ice patrol ship, HMS Endurance, there has been concern whether the Inventory’s sampling regime guarantees sufficient time ashore at appropriate times to collect relevant data, whether only major changes may be detected, and whether all potentially relevant variables are being monitored or monitored appropriately (Jatko and Hofman, 2002). 
Addressing these concerns, in November 2003, the Antarctic Site Inventory inaugurated a five-year assessment and monitoring program at Petermann Island (65˚10’S, 64˚10’W), which was the sixth most heavily visited Antarctic Peninsula visitor site during the 14-year period, 1989-2003. According to data compiled by the Antarctic Site Inventory, it is a site with medium species diversity and moderate sensitivity to potential disruptions from visitors. Researchers will be on site for extended periods, which ensures that data sets on population size and breeding success are collected precisely during the respective peaks of egg-laying and chick-créching. This further ensures that these data may be used to detect direct and cumulative impacts on Petermann Island’s penguin and shag populations, and to enable determinations whether or not tourism may be implicated as a potential cause for any detected impacts.

Conclusion
The recent Antarctic Treaty Meeting Of Experts (ATME) reflects a growing concern by Parties regarding: potential impacts from nongovernmental activities in the Antarctic, including tourism; how these activities may or may not come within the ambit and authority of the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol; and the monitoring requirements of Article 3 of the Protocol. 
The approaches taken by the Antarctic Site Inventory project with respect to assessing and monitoring Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites should assist CEP in evaluating the:
    • Established assessment and monitoring authorities guiding the choice of methodology for a coordinated monitoring program;
    • Components of the Antarctic ecosystem that, potentially, are indicator species to monitor; and
    • Relevant, variable data sets that should be collected in regard to these indicator species (particularly, population size and breeding success).

Recommendations for CEP with respect to monitoring
In providing the ATCM with recommendations for the coordinated monitoring of activities in Antarctica, CEP should appropriately consider the:
    • Nature, scope, and concentration of activities that could have unacceptable effects;
    • Components of the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem (i.e. indicator species) most likely to be affected by these activities;
    • Appropriate parameters and data sets, regarding these indicator species, for ascertaining whether populations are being impacted directly or cumulatively; and
    • Ensure that the coordinated monitoring program require observations at a series of comparable sites along a gradient with different types and levels of activities, so that any detected environmental impacts possibly resulting from these activities may be distinguished from those impacts caused by other factors.

    • = Sites not evaluated by the Antarctic Site Inventory. The “Paradise Bay” site, as noted in the Site Compendium, is nonspecifically described in the NSF/OPP visitation compilations; two sites found within Paradise Bay — Waterboat Point and the Almirante Brown Station — both exhibit low species diversity and site sensitivity. Other research projects are underway at both Goudier Island and Palmer Station, the former under the auspices of the UK government, the latter under the auspices of the US government.
