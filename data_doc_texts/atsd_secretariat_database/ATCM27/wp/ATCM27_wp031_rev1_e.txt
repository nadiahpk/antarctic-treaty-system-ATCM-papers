REVIEW OF ATCM RECOMMENDATIONS ON AREA PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT












Decision xx (2004)

REVIEW OF MEASURES

The Representatives,
Taking into account Decision 3 (2002) of the XXV ATCM;
Conscious of the need to continue the review of past measures* started at XXV ATCM;
Desiring to clarify which measures on area protection and management, whether approved or not, still require action by the Parties;
Recognising that some of these measures have been terminated by a decision of the ATCM; superseded by later measures dealing with the same subject matter; spent by actions of the Parties or by the passage of time; have not become effective according to the provisions of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty; or will not enter into effect because of the stated intention of Parties not to approve them;
Recognising also that the review of measures is an ongoing process required to maintain an accurate record of the instruments of ATCM, and their content if relevant; and
Noting that the measures listed in Annex A have been terminated by decisions of the ATCM and will require no further action by the Parties;

Decide: 
    1. That the measures listed in Annex B have been superseded by subsequent measures;
    2. That the abovementioned measure will require no further action by the Parties; and
    3. That the Parties will continue the review of measures so that further consideration can be undertaken at XXVIII ATCM concerning which other measures may be considered spent, superseded or otherwise obsolete.


* Measures adopted under Art. IX of the Treaty were called “recommendations” until 1995.
