Waste Water Management in Antarctica
COMNAP Workshop

Background
On 28 August, 2014, COMNAP held the “Advancing Antarctic Station Waste Water Management Workshop” as part of the COMNAP Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Christchurch, New Zealand. The co-convenors of the workshop were Dr Sandra Potter (AAD) and Dr Jose Retamales (INACH). Dr Hyoung Chul Shin (KOPRI), EXCOM Vice Chair with oversight of the COMNAP Environmental Expert Group, also assisted with the planning of the workshop. Twenty national Antarctic programs participated in the event and more than 60 people attended one or more of the sessions. 

The attached convenors report provides a summary of items discussed. The presentations and the convenor’s report highlights:
    • how the management of waste water is becoming an increasingly complex issue
    • the wide range of technologies currently in use to treat waste water generated by stations in Antarctica
    • how many of the systems employed in Antarctica are undergoing continuous improvement
    • how compliance with Annex III of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty alone may be insufficient in protecting the Antarctic environment, and
    • the value in information sharing on environment protection challenges and solutions.

The presentations and the convenor’s report were shared with all COMNAP members from December 2014 by way of the COMNAP member’s only website.
