Russian studies of subglacial Lake Vostok in the season
 2014–2015
Three years ago on 5 February 2012, Russian specialists were the first in the world to penetrate the subglacial Antarctic water body – Lake Vostok. This event occurred at the drilling complex of the Russian inland Vostok station and had a wide public and scientific response in Russia and in other countries. 
Using unique national technology developed in the St. Petersburg National Mineral Resources University, the deepest of all ice boreholes ever drilled on Earth was drilled in the glacier 3769 m thick, while water from the surface lake layer came up as predicted by designers of the ecologically clean penetration to Lake Vostok. It was practically impossible to foresee all details of this event due to some reasons as the precise glacier thickness was unknown, supplies of Freon – heaver of the drilling fluid at the station were exhausted and the time of the final in that Antarctic season aircraft flight to the coastal Progress station unavoidably approached. Details of penetration in 2012 were set forth in the Russian ATCM XXXV IP74 Results of Russian activities for penetration to the subglacial Lake Vostok in the season 2011-2012. Besides, no one in the world before the Russian specialists performed such operations. As a result, the rise of lake water upward the borehole comprised 592.6 m rather than 60-80 m, as supposed by designers of the Project of ecologically clean penetration to the lake dropping then to the level of 363 m from the “ice-water” interface (depth of 3406 m) (ATCM XXXVI IP49 Results of studies of the subglacial Lake Vostok and drilling operations in deep ice borehole at Vostok station in the season 2011-2012).
Probable causes for such process were an extremely large rate of drill recovery from the borehole when it performed a function of a peculiar piston pumping water from the lake and presence of a hydraulic fracture in the borehole lateral side. 
During the season 2012-2013 at Vostok station, drilling of “fresh frozen” ice core formed of water that had risen upward in the borehole, began from a depth of 3406 m. Due to drill deviation from the previous borehole, this “fresh frozen” ice core ended at a mark of 3460 m, after which the drill went into the lateral borehole side. 
For the past two Antarctic seasons 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, a depth of 3724 m of the borehole bottom was reached in early February, as a result of operation of the drilling team of the Russian Antarctic Expedition. Thus, 45 m of glacial ice remained to the “ice-water” interface by December 2014. This activity was resumed in the season 2014-2015 in the middle of December 2014 under the Program of the 60th RAE. On 14 January 2015, drilling was stopped at a depth mark of 3765 m – in 4 m from the water column of the lake. From 15 to 21 January, vertical density distribution of the drilling fluid (mixture of kerosene and Freon) and temperature and pressure were measured over the entire depth of the borehole. In addition, specially developed sampling equipment was tested and video recording of the state of the lateral sides of the borehole was made. On 22 January, drilling operations at Vostok station were resumed. They were carried out not for 24 h a day, as at the beginning of 2015 but in a two-shift mode, so that penetration to the lake was not to occur during the night shift.
On 25 January at 13 h 12 min MSK, the second penetration of the drill to the surface layer of the subglacial Lake Vostok occurred. This time the ice thickness over the core length was 3769.15 m, i.e., by 15 cm less than in 2012. This indicates different angles of the ice borehole tilts rather than the existence of irregularities at the bottom glacier surface. The last ice core in the drilling project of the season 2014-2015 had a size of 71 cm. Lifting of the drill after its contact with the surface water layer was made taking into account corrections of methodological errors of 2012. Before penetration to the lake, the level of the drilling fluid in the borehole was at a depth of 95.54 m, and at the time of unsealing - at a depth of 65.5 m. After the drill was recovered from the borehole, it was at a depth of 46 m. The latter value of the drilling fluid rise was connected with the volume of the power cable to which the drill is secured. As a result of its rise, the free volume was filled with water from the subglacial lake. According to calculations of drillers, the value of the water rise upward the borehole was to comprise 71 m. 
After melting and cleaning of the drill, drilling of “fresh frozen” ice core formed on the lower borehole segment began. The actual water rise upward the borehole was 72.5 m. As a result of the second drilling of the borehole after unsealing the subglacial Lake Vostok, there was recovered to the surface: 0.92 m of the core of lake water frozen in the borehole (depth interval along the core of 3696.65 – 3697.57 m), 10.55 m of the core of white compact material (rapidly frozen foam-like mass, supposedly a mixture of ice and Freon hydrate), formed in the borehole due to drilling fluid/lake water reaction (interval of 3697.57 – 3708.12 m), 0.82 m of the core of lake water frozen in the borehole (interval of 3708.12 – 3708.94). In total, 12.29 m of “fresh frozen” ice core was extracted. In the last trip on 03.02.2015, the breakoff of the ice core caused a lake water inflow. During the recovery of the drill cable, kerosene was periodically added to the borehole in accordance with the volume of the lifted cable. As a result of the new contact of the drill and water that was in the borehole, its total rise was not more than 5-7 m. Thus, the expected water rise level in the borehole comprises about 65-67 m.  The results of second penetration to the subglacial lake showed the Russian drillers to have mastered the technology of management of water level rise in the borehole and that they can regulate this process during repeated drilling of “ice plugs”, which will be created at the end of each Antarctic season before investigating the water column characteristics of the lake.
