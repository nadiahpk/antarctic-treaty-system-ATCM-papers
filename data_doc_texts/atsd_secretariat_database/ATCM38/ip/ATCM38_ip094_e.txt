Climate Change in Antarctica

Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom



The attached graphic has been put together by the British Antarctic Survey, to show at a glance, the patterns and magnitudes of change in the climate of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.  

Using indicators linked to atmospheric and ocean systems, the graphic demonstrates that the Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing the greatest increase in mean-annual air temperature, resulting in the Bellingshausen Sea being ice covered for 100 days less in recent years than it was in the early 1980s.  Conversely, parts of the Ross Sea are experiencing up to 100 days of more sea ice over the same timeframe.

Hard copies of the graphic will be circulated at ATCM XXXVIII.
