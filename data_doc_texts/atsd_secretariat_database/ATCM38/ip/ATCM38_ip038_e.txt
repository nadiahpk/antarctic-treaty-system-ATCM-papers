Summary of South Africa’s Antarctic Authorisation Process

Information Paper presented by South Africa
 
Summary

South Africa’s Antarctic Treaties Act No. 60 of 1996 incorporates the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (including its Annexes I-V) into South African law. Since the ratification in November 2013 of Annex VI to the Protocol, given the current emphasis on developing more pressing national legislation, South Africa has yet to revise its existing legislation to include Annex VI. Regulations to give effect to the Act have also yet to be promulgated. This legislation as it stands does therefore not establish a permitting regime for South African or visitor activities in Antarctica. In the absence thereof, and in preparation for a formal permitting process, visitors are required to obtain the necessary written authorisation in advance from the current competent authority for South Africa which is the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). 

This IP outlines South Africa’s authorisation process for Antarctic activities. There is currently only one known commercial Antarctic tour operator in South Africa, and thus limited applications by non-governmental operators have been submitted through them to DEA on an annual basis over the past two years.  


Background

Persons requiring authorisation

    • South African private expeditions to Antarctica; 

    • South African nationals on private expeditions to Antarctica; 

    • South African private registered vessels and aircraft entering Antarctica; and 

    • Anyone departing from South Africa to Antarctica.

Application process

Known prospective persons / expeditions must provide the following comprehensive information:

    • proposed itinerary of any visit to Antarctica;

    • names of all participants (together with their Antarctic experience, as relevant); and
 
    • all activities they wish to undertake while in Antarctica.  




All applicants must complete an:

    • Antarctic Treaty Measures, Decisions and Recommendations (MDR’s) Compliance Form (which includes a detailed risk assessment covering all proposed activities, proof of appropriate insurance cover, contingency plans and any arrangements for search and rescue and medical cover; and

    • Environmental Impact Assessment (IEE).

Consideration of applications

All applicants will ideally be required to visit the DEA or be visited by a representative of DEA, where                                                             feasible, in order to present their envisaged activities and to allow for a full discussion, briefing and assessment of the proposed activities. This may also include a physical inspection of all aircraft, ships, yachts equipment and cargo etc. to ensure adherence to quarantine and other measures. 

The DEA shall issue the authorisation and / or recommendation to a permitting authority, if the applicant intends departing from an Antarctic Treaty Party country which may have a permitting process in place already, if DEA is satisfied that all activities comply with the requirements determined in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

Authorisation conditions

The DEA may attach conditions to an authorisation / recommendation should it be required for the further protection of the Antarctic environment.
