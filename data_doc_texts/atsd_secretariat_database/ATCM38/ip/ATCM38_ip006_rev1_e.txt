Summary of Japan’s Certification Process of Antarctic Activity

Information Paper presented by Japan
Summary
This IP outlines Japan’s certification process of Antarctic activity and its recent trends. There are few commercial Antarctic tour operators in Japan, and thus few applications by non-governmental operators have been submitted to Japan on an annual basis. However, Japan has faced some challenges in its certification process. 

Outline of Japan’s legislation and certification process

Japan introduced its Law Relating to Protection of the Environment in Antarctica in 1997 to implement the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

Scope of application

Japan’s law shall apply to:

    • Japanese nationals
    • Juridical persons of Japan
    • Foreigners residing in Japan
    • Foreign juridical persons having offices in Japan whose employees engage in Antarctic activities or are involved in the supervision of Antarctic activities in connection with the business of the said juridical persons.

Application process

An application for certification of an Arctic activity plan shall be submitted to the Minister of the Environment by any person who will supervise the Antarctic activity plan.

An application should describe the following matters:

    • The name or title and address of the Supervisor and, in case of a juridical person, the name of its representative and director;
    • The purpose of the Antarctic activity plan
    • The number of persons who will engage in the Antarctic activities contained in the Antarctic activity plan
    • The purpose, timing, place and implementation methods of the Antarctic activities
    • The details of the acts that constitute the Antarctic activity plan and the names of persons who will perform those acts, if already determined

Consideration of applications

The Minister of the Environment shall issue certification, if he/she determines that all Antarctic Activities contained in the Antarctic Activity Plan related to an Application satisfy the requirements determined in the Madrid Protocol.
If the Minister of the Environment, having received an application, determines it necessary to examine whether the application meets the requirements, he/she may issue an order in writing to the applicant requesting that the applicant take some or all of the following measures within a reasonable period of time (the reasons for issuing the order and the time allotted for meeting its requirement shall be stipulated in the order):

    • Amendment of the application
    • Submission of the Initial Environmental Evaluation
    • Revision of  or supplement to IEE

Japanese law does not use the term ‘permit’ but ‘certification’, because ‘permit’ means exception of illegal action in our legal framework, and activities, including tourism, in the Antarctic Treaty Area are guaranteed by the Antarctic Treaty.

Certification shows that the persons performing the Antarctic activities under their supervision are engaged in Antarctic activity plan that has been duly certified.
The certification also shows the following:

    • Date of certification;
    • Name of the juridical person and of its representative;
    • Purpose;
    • Timing;
    • Place;
    • Implementation method;
    • Conditions;
    • Issues related to permit  under Article 4, Annex II  to  Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;
    • Issues related to permit under Article 3, Annex II to Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;
    • Issues related to permit under Article 7, Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty; and.
    • Others

Certification conditions

The Minister of the Environment may attach conditions to a certification, to the extent he/she determines such conditions are necessary for the protection of the Antarctic environment. 

Exemption of application

Submission of application for certification is exempt if such activity has received permission or other administrative treatment similar to the certification stipulated in the Japanese Law, and is pursuant to the provision of any law or regulation of a foreign country that is a Party to the Protocol that is comparable to Japanese Law.

An obligation to submit application for certification does not apply to the following activities when conducted in the marine areas of Antarctica (except those performed in conjunction with Antarctic activities not listed below)

    • Killing or captivity of marine animals or plants living in the marine areas of Antarctica without violating the provision of any law or regulation restricting or prohibiting such action
    • Sailing of ships or flying of aircrafts, which do not include entry into an Antarctic Specially Protected Area.
    • Conducting of scientific research the result of which are to be made public

Recent trend

There is no tourism operator conducting tourism in the terrestrial area of Antarctica at this moment. This results in the limited number of applications to the Minister of the Environment in accordance with the Law Relating to Protection of the Environment in Antarctica. Actually, there have been only 6 submissions during the past five years. 
Nevertheless, Japan has faced some difficulties in the certification process. Some of these submissions were for the operation of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) for TV filming and taking photographs. Japan certified them based on the fact that the applicants promised to act in accordance with Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica, Annex to Resolution 2 (2004), and that they had developed preventative measures designed to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies and contingency plans for responses to incidents with potential adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment. However, much is not known on the potential impacts of operating UAVs on Antarctic environment.
Japan finds it very useful, if UAVs   issues by certificating could be discussed.
