Summary of the United States Framework for Regulation of Antarctic Tourism
Information Paper presented by the United States
Summary
This information paper presents an overview of the current U.S. framework for regulation of U.S. tourist expeditions to Antarctica. The United States implements the Protocol through legislation and regulations and has an interest in minimizing environmental impacts of U.S. tourists and U.S.-based tour operators. 

Background
Advance Notification
Under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty, each Party is required to provide advance notification of “all expeditions to and within Antarctica, on the part of its ships or nationals, and all expeditions to Antarctica organized in or proceeding from its territory.”  U.S. tour operators organizing expeditions to Antarctica are required to provide advance notification of their expeditions to the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. Department of State then provides this information to the Antarctic Treaty System. The U.S. National
Science Foundation (NSF), as manager of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), provides advance notification for U.S. governmental expeditions.

Regulation Through the Permitting Process
The United States implements the Protocol through legislation and regulations. The Antarctic Conservation Act, as amended (ACA), applies to, among others, tour operators and tourists subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Under the ACA, it is unlawful, unless authorized by permit, for tourist expeditions and others subject to U.S. jurisdiction to:
    • Take or engage in harmful interference of native mammals, bird, plants and/or invertebrates;
    • Enter specially protected areas;
    • Introduce non-native species to Antarctica;
    • Introduce substances designated as pollutants (including fuels);
    • Discharge wastes; or
    • Import certain Antarctic items into the United States.

NSF administers a permitting program that requires permits for taking or engaging in harmful interference of native birds, mammals, plants, and/or invertebrates; entering Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs); or using or releasing designated pollutants or disposing of waste. The permit process is transparent. NSF publishes requests for new permits or material changes to existing permits, and public comment is invited. Those to whom permits are issued must provide an annual report of their activities.

Under the regulations that implement the ACA, a permit to take or engage in harmful interference may only be issued for the purposes of providing specimens for scientific study or information or for museums or other educational uses.  Most tourist expeditions would not be able to meet the criteria under the regulations for obtaining such a permit.  Tourist expeditions also do not qualify for permits for entry into ASPAs, except for cases in which areas are protected for their historic value and where issuing a permit for tourist visits would be consistent with the management plan for the ASPA. Accordingly, U.S. implementation of Annex V of the Protocol effectively prevents tourists from entering those areas designated as specially protected because of their environmental or scientific values. To enter sites designated as protected for historic values (e.g., ASPA 157, Shackleton’s hut at Cape Royds), U.S.-based tour operators must apply for permits to enter. Tourist and other nongovernmental expeditions planning to use or release designated pollutants or to release wastes are required to prepare a plan for the use, storage, and disposal of these materials and to apply for a waste management permit from NSF. Some categories of waste must be removed from the Antarctic.

In addition, the following activities are prohibited, regardless of whether a tour operator has a permit:
    • Open burning of wastes;
    • Use or release of banned substances into Antarctica (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls);
    • Disposal of waste onto ice-free land areas or into fresh water systems; and
    • Damaging, removing, or destroying a historic site or monument.

Environmental Impact Assessment
The United States has established a comprehensive system to implement Annex I of the Environmental Protocol. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) regulations provide for the environmental impact assessment of nongovernmental activities, including tourism, for which the United States is required to give advance notice, i.e., all nongovernmental expeditions including tourists and nongovernmental research expeditions.  The regulations do not apply to individual U.S. citizens or groups of citizens planning to travel to Antarctica on an expedition for which they are not acting as an operator or to U.S. citizens who participate in tours organized in and proceeding from countries other than the United States.  For nongovernmental activities, EPA, in consultation with other interested Federal agencies, is responsible for the review of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) prepared by nongovernmental operators.  

For nongovernmental EIAs, EPA provides copies of the initial EIA to designated Federal agency reviewers with relevant expertise upon receipt. EPA’s comments to the operator are then developed in coordination with these Federal reviewers and include their comments, as appropriate. EPA’s regulations provide for three levels of EIA documentation: preliminary environmental review, initial environmental evaluation (IEE), and comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE). The review process is intended to ensure that the EIA identifies the activities, assesses the potential impacts, and includes mitigation measures that will ensure that any potential impacts are consistent with the level of documentation (e.g., for an IEE, any impacts will be no more than minor or transitory). EPA’s regulations require submission of basic information that is similar in content to an Advance Notification, as well as the specific information required for one of the three levels of EIA documentation noted. With regard to the specific levels of documentation, EPA’s regulations implement the requirements of Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol and parallel those requirements. There are no specific models or forms required for this documentation process and no permits are issued.  However, based on the United States Government’s review, operators are notified whether their environmental documentation meets the requirements of Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol and the provisions of the U.S. EIA regulations.  The EIA documents include post-trip reports that are submitted to NSF.

EPA’s regulations also include schedules for document submission and for EPA’s review in advance of the expedition’s proposed departure date, i.e., 180 days for a preliminary environmental review memorandum and 90 days for an IEE. The schedule for draft and final CEEs is linked to the Protocol, Annex I, Article 3, requirements that draft CEEs be circulated to all Parties for comment and to the Committee for Environmental Protection 120 days in advance of the next Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and that final CEEs be circulated to all Parties no later than 60 days before the proposed departure of the expedition. To date there have not been any nongovernmental U.S. expeditions at the CEE level of documentation. 

EPA provides copies of documents submitted by tour and other nongovernmental operators to the public upon request and asks that EPA be copied on any comments sent to the operator. EPA will then consider these comments in its review of the EIA, as appropriate. The EIA process for both governmental and nongovernmental activities is transparent, and environmental documents are available to the public.

Current Experiences
Overall, the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection provides the basis for regulating Antarctic tourist activities and the United States supports strong and effective domestic implementation of the Parties’ existing obligations under the Protocol.  Generally, the United States hasn’t experienced challenges when regulating tourism activities; including coordination related to various activities under one expedition that involve multiple authorities.  However, the United States has experienced some challenges related to station visits by groups that include both government and non-governmental participants.  In some cases, expectations on the part of the United States and/or the trip organizers were not met.  Lastly, due to the recent increase in requests from U.S. operators to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during tourism expeditions, the United States has an interest in the Parties’ experiences related to the usage and potential impacts of UAVs used during non-governmental tourism expeditions.
