Art Programme and International Cooperation
Art in Antarctica, a ten year project
The Cultural Project Department of the Dirección Nacional del Antártico, enhances and promotes the exploration of aesthetic proposals for developing artistic projects focalized in the Antarctic. 
The Art in Residency Program and the International Cooperation Program are included in the Antarctic Summer Campaign, which takes place between November and March of every year, and art works are then shown in national and international temporary and itinerant exhibitions named Polar South - Art in Antarctica, as well as other venues including seminars, lectures, printing material and exchanges.
The proposal seeks to reflect a creative awareness in the general public regarding the importance of scientific research and the protection of the Antarctic environment, through various artistic expressions based on international cooperation.
Goals 
    • To include Antarctica in national and international cultural projects.
    • To provide contact for people who have no access to Antarctica, by including art exhibitions in those of historic and scientific features. 
    • To promote the development of contemporary art as well as a conscious reflection on Antarctica. 
    • To enhance links between arts and sciences, by promoting interaction of different disciplines. 
    • To develop the Antarctic imaginary, as well as an awareness and responsibility about our heritage and the environment. 
    • To improve links with institutions, associations, and universities to further enhance international cooperation.
    • To generate an international Antarctic Artists link.
Introduction to Art and Culture Programme 
The project was first outlined in May 2004 by the Dirección Nacional del Antártico and was supported by Fondo Nacional de las Artes, in Argentina and Guggenheim Foundation, in New York, United States. The Art and Culture Project of DNA was initiated with Argentine artists and was included in the International Cooperation Programme in 2006 with artists from Spain and Canada, thus deepening the artistic exploration “The Polar Dialogues” by delving into the aesthetic possibilities of contemporary art associated with current matters concerning environment and by promoting works at national and international levels. 
Research carried out by scientists from Dirección Nacional del Antártico - DNA and Instituto Antártico Argentino, such as "Appearance of Methane Hydrochloride on glacier ice surfaces” and "Evidence of Climate Warming in the Antarctic Peninsula and disappearance of the Larsen Ice Shelf”, were the starting points of this project, which takes up the effects caused by climate change in the Antarctic Peninsula. The Art Programme in Antarctica received other artists who work in the aesthetic research on different disciplines, by combining art and science to stimulate a reflexive conscience in order to promote works related to Antarctica. 
During the summer campaigns between 2009 and 2013 artists from Australia, UK, Austria, Spain, Russia, Chile, Mexico, USA, Italy and Germany who developed artistic research projects joined audible and visual.
In order to select the best proposals for projects of art and culture in Antarctica, a selection mechanism was established by renowned external evaluators. A medical and psychological evaluation of the artists is also carried out, similar to those undergone by scientists involved in Antarctic campaigns.
This program helped increase awareness and knowledge of research and efforts to protect the Antarctic continent as a pristine area, reaching an audience with little contact with the reality of Antarctica. This is why it has been maintained over time. The program includes artists from various disciplines of art and prioritizes international cooperation, either to work in Antarctica or to participate in exhibitions.
Streaming Museum
Since January 2008 the international multi-media event “Streaming Museum” takes place every six months at Carlini Station. This event is conducted and created by Nina Colosi, curator, and broadcasted to the six continents simultaneously. The site www.streamingmuseum.org is largely visited from different latitudes and the proposal is to bring art to different points of the world simultaneously, by using digital instruments allowing for a quick outreach. The second edition included artists having worked in the Artic and the Antarctic.
