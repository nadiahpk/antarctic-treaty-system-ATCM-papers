Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2014-15

Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom in conjunction with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Summary

Since 2010, the United Kingdom, in conjunction with IAATO, has provided reports to the ATCM about the number of yachts sighted in the Antarctic during each previous season (ATCMXXXIII/WP52; ATCMXXXIV/WP20; ATCMXXXV/IP42; ATCM XXXVI/IP54; ATCM XXXVII/IP55).  This Information Paper provides such information for the past (2014-15) season.  The data is derived from landings reported by the British team at Port Lockroy, Antarctic Peninsula, and supplemented by additional sightings recorded by other UK vessels, IAATO members in the Treaty area, and others. 


Background

Parties have previously welcomed information about sighted yacht activities, which have enabled Parties to both consider the overall volume of yachts known to be visiting the continent, and to confirm whether appropriate authorisations for such activities had been obtained. 

As in previous years, the information from Port Lockroy has been collected as part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and vessels).  The information from IAATO members and others is from other incidental sightings. We would welcome any supplementary material which adds to or verifies this information. 
 
Compared to last year, the overall number of yachts sighted showed a minor increase, from 36 in 2013-14 (of which 20 were IAATO members and 16 were not), to 38 in 2014-15 (of which 15 were IAATO members and 23 were not).  Three vessels were confirmed as unauthorised, and the authorisation of three yachts registered to Switzerland is unknown.

Recommendation

Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom and IAATO believe that it is important that the ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting activities in Antarctica, taking particular note to identify those yachts that may have been in the region without authorisation from a Treaty Party.  

For that reason, the UK and IAATO invite the ATCM to encourage Parties to continue to share information about yachts they have authorised, including for example via the EIES Pre-Season Information facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with Resolution 5 (2005).  IAATO would continue to welcome information about non-IAATO yachts receiving authorisation.
