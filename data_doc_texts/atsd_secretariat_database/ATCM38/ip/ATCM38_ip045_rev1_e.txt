Australia’s Approval of Measure 4 (2004), Measure 1 (2005), and Measure 15 (2009) 
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
This paper details Australia’s approval of three measures adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM). Australia has now approved Measure 4 (2004), Measure 1 (2005) and Measure 15 (2009). The approval instrument was signed on 15 May 2014, and the depository government was notified through diplomatic channels on 2 July 2014. For the information of Parties, and in accordance with the agreement at ATCM XXXIV (2011) to share legislation or draft legislation to ratify Annex VI of the Protocol, Australia provides details for accessing copies of the legislation. 
Background 
Australia has approved three measures agreed by the ATCM, namely:

1. Measure 4 (2004) Insurance and contingency planning for tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area, adopted at the 27th ATCM in Cape Town on 4 June 2004;

2. Measure 1 (2005) Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Liability arising from environmental emergencies, adopted at the 28th ATCM in Stockholm on 17 June 2005; and,

3. Measure 15 (2009) Landing of persons from passenger vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area, adopted at the 32nd ATCM in Baltimore on 17 April 2009.  

Australia’s legislation to implement these measures, the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Act 2012, entered into law on 28 June 2012 (although the amendments will commence when the relevant Measures come into force). The Amendment Act amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980, the main Commonwealth Act that implements the provisions of the Protocol in Australian law.  The final step in Australia’s domestic approval process, being approval by the Federal Executive Council, has now been achieved.  Australia therefore has now formally approved the three Measures, in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 9 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The depositary government has been notified through diplomatic channels of this approval. Australia’s legislative amendments implementing each of Measure 1 (2005), Measure 4 (2004), and Measure 15 (2009) will commence separately as each measure comes into force, that is, once all 28 Consultative Parties have approved them.

At ATCM XXXIV Parties agreed that the domestic legislative packages developed by those Parties most advanced in the process of approving Annex VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty could provide advice and assistance to other Parties in order to facilitate their progress (paragraph 169 of the ATCM XXXIV Final Report).
	
Accordingly, we draw the attention of Parties to Australia’s legislation which can be found on the Australian legislation register.1  

Australia would be pleased to provide further information to any interested Parties.
