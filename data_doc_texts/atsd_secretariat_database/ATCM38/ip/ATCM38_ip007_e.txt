Activity of the Republic of Belarus in Antarctica
in 2007–2014 and Today
In 2006 the President of the Republic of Belarus signed the Law of the Republic of Belarus "On Accession of the Republic of Belarus to the Antarctic Treaty". The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus issued a decree to approve the State Programme "Monitoring of Polar Regions of the Earth and Support of Arctic and Antarctic Expeditions in 2007–2010 and for the Period till 2015".
In 2007, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus issued a decree to create a working body to manage the State Programme – the state authority "Republican Centre of Polar Research". In 2008, the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus "On Accession of the Republic of Belarus to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty" was approved. In 2011, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus issued a decree to approve the new State Programme "Monitoring of Polar Regions of the Earth and Support of Arctic and Antarctic Expeditions in 2011–2015" (hereinafter referred to as the State Programme). 
The National Academy of Sciences of Belarus is the Coordinating Sponsor of the State Program, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection of the Republic of Belarus is the Sponsor of the State Program. Both are executive state authorities responsible for implementation of international obligations assumed by the Republic of Belarus under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. They organise scientific research, provide logistic support for Belarusian Antarctic expeditions and prepare required regulatory, legal and technical facilities related to polar research.
To coordinate the activity of Belarusian state authorities and organisations responsible for implementation of international obligations assumed by the Republic of Belarus under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a Multi-authority Antarctic Commission of the Republic of Belarus has been working since 2013. The Commission is comprised of representatives of 8 ministries and organisations of the Republic of Belarus which participate in implementation of the State Programme.
During 2007–2015, the State Programme, logistically supported by the Russian Federation, organised seven Belarusian Antarctic Expeditions. Twenty seven Belarusian specialists engaged in those expeditions conducted scientific research in Antarctica. 
On 15 March 2013, the Government of the Republic of Belarus and the Government of the Russian Federation signed the Agreement on Cooperation in Antarctica. For the time being, a draft Agreement on Cooperation in Antarctica between specialized organisations of New Zealand and the Republic of Belarus is being negotiated; active work is being done to create conditions for conclusion of similar agreements with other Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.
In 2013 at the XXXVI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) held in Brussels (Belgium) and at the XXV Meeting of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) held in Seoul (the Republic of Korea), the Republic of Belarus informed the international Antarctic community about its plans to build a research station in Antarctica. The Republic of Belarus is planning to open a scientific station at the geographic complex of Mount Vechernyaya, Tala Hills, Enderby Land with the purpose to develop new promising scientific trends and to resume longstanding research observations (meteorology, actinometry, geophysics, ozonometry) conducted in this Antarctic region previously.
The first phase of construction of the station facilities is supposed to be completed in 2015–2020. The station is designed as a modular complex of facilities which will allow to accelerate and simplify the construction process, to completely avoid the use of special heavy construction equipment thus obviously preventing considerable transformation of interconnected components of the Antarctic environment. The station is planned to start its operation seasonally but later to switch over to wintering (year-round) operation cycle. Limited station staffing, wide application of solar energy, effective power, heat, water supply and water disposal systems, strict observation of waste handling rules will ensure minimal environmental impact.
While planning the supposed activities related to construction of the scientific station, the Republic of Belarus ensures consistent implementation of the environmental impact assessment procedures established in Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. In 2013, the Republic of Belarus prepared an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) and then a draft a Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA). 
The purpose of the CEA is to substantiate the construction of Belarusian Antarctic scientific station at the geographic complex of Mount Vechernyaya, Tala Hills, Enderby Land (67°39.5’S, 46°09.2’E). When preparing the draft CEA, consideration was given to the fact that the territory of the planned Belarusian scientific station location is in the area of long-term and intensive human induced impact and may be classified as an irreversibly transformed area. It is supposed that the planned impact during construction and further operation of the Belarusian scientific station will not exceed the environmental impact on this Antarctic area produced by the Soviet/Russian field base "Mount Vechernyaya" for over thirty years during its operation in 70s–90s of the last century. The new knowledge obtained as a result of scientific research at the Belarusian Antarctic station will considerably compensate those minimal losses that might be inflicted on the Antarctic environment during construction and operation of the station. Russian and New Zealand specialists provided an invaluable guidance to the Republic of Belarus in preparing the CEA. Advices and recommendations of international experts were also of great use and value.
In January 2014, according to the procedures established in Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the draft CEA was submitted to the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty and presented for consideration to the Committee for Environmental Protection. In May 2014, the draft CEA was considered at the XXXVII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) – XVII Meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) in Brasilia. From June 2014 till April 2015, the Republic of Belarus was carrying out activities to summarise and eliminate particular shortages highlighted during consideration of the draft CEA. The final CEA including a summary of all comments to the draft CEA will be presented by the Republic of Belarus at ATCM XXXVIII – CEP XVIII in Sofia (Bulgaria).
On 26 to 29 May 2014, the I International Scientific Practical Conference "Monitoring of Antarctic Environment Condition and Support of Activities of International Expeditions" was held in the Republic of Belarus under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.
60 specialists representing 22 organisations from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine participating in the conference took part in the work of the conference. 38 reports were heard during the plenary sessions. 9 reports were presented as posters.
The reports presented by the conference participants reflected the diversity of problems connected with research and exploration of Antarctica including the issues of creation of a stationary research infrastructure (stations) by various Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, development of environment-oriented activities and improvement of logistic schemes. The conference pointed out high scientific value of the results of Antarctic problems research produced by scientists from the countries participating in the Antarctic Treaty. The conference's decision emphasizes the necessity to strengthen scientific, environment-oriented and logistical cooperation between the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.
In 2014, the Republic of Belarus carried out a number of organisational and logistical activities to organise the 2014–2015 Seventh Belarusian Seasonal Antarctic Expedition as part of the 60th Russian Antarctic Expedition. Five specialists took part in the Seventh Belarusian Antarctic Expedition. They carried out scientific research using instrumentation and practices developed in the Republic of Belarus and abroad in the following disciplines:
- research of atmospheric aerosol parameters and terrain reflection spectra;
- synchronous ground-based measurements and observations of agreed parameters and natural features during the periods of remote sensing of the area of activity of the Belarusian Antarctic Expedition by Russian and Belarusian space satellites;
- examination of ozone layer condition and radiation balance components;
- standard weather observations and climatic surveys;
- study of snow-and-firn mass structure by radar sensing methods;
- measurement of variations of the Earth's magnetic field;
- study of living marine, freshwater and terricole biological objects and microbiological surveys; 
- ecological and microbiological monitoring of key environmental parameters in the area of activity of the Belarusian Antarctic Expedition;
- meteorological and technical support of inland air flights DROMLAN.
For the time being, the Republic of Belarus is finishing the work on preparation of the next phase blueprint of the State Programme "Monitoring of Polar Regions of the Earth and Support of Arctic and Antarctic Expeditions in 2016–2020 and for the Period till 2025".
The primary current and long-term objective of activities of the Republic of Belarus in Antarctica is acquisition of new knowledge, development and extension of international cooperation for the sake of science and progress of the whole mankind. We are open to establish scientific and business cooperation with all international and national agencies and organisations for which both Antarctica and our activity in Antarctica are of interest in scientific or technical field.
