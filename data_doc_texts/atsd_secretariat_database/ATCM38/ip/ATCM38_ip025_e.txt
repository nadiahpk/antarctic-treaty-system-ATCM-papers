Finland’s Antarctic Research Strategy 2014
Information Paper submitted by Finland

1. Introduction

The Finnish Coordination Committee for Antarctic Research has updated Finland's Antarctic Research Strategy in 2014. The Strategy takes into account the developments in national and international research environments and priorities since the previous Strategy in 2007.  
In addition to updating the Antarctic Research Strategy, the task of the Committee is to strengthen national Antarctic research co-operation, promote Finland’s involvement in international Antarctic research co-operation, promote awareness and discussion on Antarctic research, and to monitor Finland’s Antarctic research results and adherence to international obligations. The Committee has a wide representation from a variety of ministries, universities, research institutions and research funding organizations. The Committee also consulted the science community and other Antarctic research stakeholders in the preparation of the Strategy.
The Academy of Finland organizes regular calls for Antarctic research. For the period of 2013-2016 a total of 2.5 million euros was granted to research projects. Higher education institutes and research institutes also promote Antarctic research with their own and other external funding.

2. Finland’s Antarctic Research Strategy 2014

The aim of Antarctic research is to produce high quality scientific data that either concern Antarctica or for which information obtained from Antarctica is indispensable. Moreover, the research will generate information to support national and international decision-making. In Finnish Antarctic research the emphasis is especially in those priority areas where Finland can conduct high-quality international scientific research. Finland’s expertise in the Arctic region is broad-based, and can in many cases be applied to the Antarctic region. Antarctic research strengthens Finnish expertise on cold-climate conditions.  
The vision of the Finnish Antarctic Research Strategy is to conduct research of high international standard and to be open to new directions. This vision is carried out through three focus areas and specific measures identified for each focus area:
    1. Antarctic research produces new scientific breakthroughs using unique data

    • Researchers and research groups are involved in both national and international multidisciplinary co-operation, including with actors in the field of technology.
    • Research is interactive and multidisciplinary. Co-operation with Arctic research and oceanographic research is strengthened.
    • Research results are published in international peer-reviewed publications and communicated to the public.
    • Research results are in wide use, including national and international decision-making.
    • The Antarctic Research website (www.antarctica.fi) is enhanced and used for disseminating information about research activities.
    • Research seminars are organized regularly in co-operation with different actors.

    2. Antarctic research is internationally interactive

    • Finnish researchers participate actively in the operations of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and take an active role in the planning and realization of research projects concerning Antarctica.
    • The National Scientific Committee of Polar Research promotes national and international co-operation. 
    • Finnish researchers’ participation in international research collaboration is supported by consistent funding of large-scale multidisciplinary research projects.
    • Finland takes part in decision-making in the Antarctic Treaty System and supports and actively develops comprehensive protection of the Antarctic region’s environment.

    3. Adequate prerequisites for Antarctic research are ensured and consistently developed

    • The Academy of Finland funds high-quality research projects with emphasis on a multidisciplinary and international approach.
    • The monitoring of research projects will be developed.
    • The Finnish Antarctic Research Program FINNARP is responsible for ensuring safe technical conditions and logistics for research and their development in Antarctica.
    • The continuity of long-term observations and measurements will be ensured.
    • The national funding for research and associated logistics will be at a level adequate for high-quality research.
