Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2013-2014 and 2014-15 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM information on IAATO operator landing site and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines use. This information paper presents the data collected by IAATO from IAATO member Post Visit Report Forms for the 2013-2014 and 2014-15 season. No non-IAATO visits are included in this analysis.
IAATO has recently developed an additional tool for processing of the PVR database. Over the next year period the intention is to conduct further, more detailed analysis of this data. This analysis will be reported to CEP and ATCM, where appropriate, and if so desired. Meantime, additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found in ATCM XXXVIII IP53IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2013-14, 2014//15 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2015/16 and on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).

Antarctic Peninsula traditional ship-borne tourism 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, which accounts for circa 95% of all landed activity.  
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). As all traditional commercial ship-borne tourism to the Peninsula during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons were conducted by IAATO member operators, it is believed that this information is reflective of actual levels of this activity.

Comparing the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons with the peak season of 2007-2008, the following trends are visible:
    • Since 2011-2012 there has been a recovery in the number of passengers taking part in traditional ship borne tourism to the Peninsula since the retraction following the global recession in 2008. This growth is variable, and in fact the 2014-15 season saw a slight decrease in numbers from the 2013-14 season, and the number of passengers is still well below the 2007-08 peak.  
    • Following the steady decline in IAATO ships operating in the area, from 33 in 2007-08 to only 20 in the 2011-12 season, there has been a slight resurgence with 24 SOLAS passenger vessels operating in 2013-14, but only 23 SOLAS passenger vessels operating in the 2014-15 season. 
    • The most notable increase has taken place in the number of voyages (from 202 in 2012-13, to 220 in 2013-14 then 225 in 2014-15). This is reflective of the increase in air/cruise expeditions which negates the need for four to five days  per voyage outside Antarctic waters to facilitate passenger turnarounds. The increase in number of voyages is also reflected in the increase in number of landings.
    • The number of landing sites used remains fairly steady showing only a minor increase in each reported season. 
Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made for the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons respectively. Unlike previous years where the top twenty most visited sites usually represents circa seventy percent (70%) of the total number of landings made, in 2013-14 the top twenty sites received 68% of the total number of visits while in 2014-15 the top twenty sites received only 65% of the visits. Despite this decrease, these relatively high percentages continue to indicate that the trend of landings concentrating at a few popular sites remains strong. 
All but one of these most-visited sites – Yalour Island – are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or National Program management through their proximity to stations. Although Yalour Island is covered by IAATO’s internal site guidelines (See ATCM XXVIII IP90 IAATO’s Site Specific Guidelines in the Antarctic Peninsula) and visits by IAATO member operators to these sites follow standard codes of conduct for visits to Antarctic landing sites including Recommendation XVIII-1 Guidelines for Tourism and Resolution XXXIV-3 General Guidelines for Visitors to the Antarctic, there may be value in considering developing site guidelines for Yalour Island. IAATO would welcome working with interested Parties in developing these guidelines. 
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons. Landings took place in Antarctica from 31 October 2013 – 30 March 2014 (a total of 151 days) and then 2 November to 30 March 2015 (a total of 149 days). This is considerably less than the peak of 174 days in the 2007/08 season. (The extended season was largely due to the operation of the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov making early season visits to emperor penguin colonies.) 
The core period for visitation by ships was 120 days between mid-November and mid-March. On the basis of the full season dates, only Goudier Island received an average of more than one visit per day and three sites (Cuverville Island, Neko Harbour and Whalers Bay) received an average of more than one visit per day during the core season.
Additional tourism statistics can be found on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).

Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines 
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and an analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms.  Appendix 3 illustrates the total number of known landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met. 

Co-ordination among IAATO field staff remains very effective. Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates that the daily limits set in the site guidelines were honoured, with no exceptions, in both 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons. 
Conclusion
While the decline of tourism seems to be stabilising, the information extracted from the Post Visit Report Forms shows that tourism levels are still depressed from the peak season of 2007-08, but recovering slightly. The increase in air cruise tourism however, has resulted in a disproportional increase in the numbers of voyages and to a lesser extent landings made. 
Almost all the landing sites in the top twenty landing sites on the peninsula are managed by ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Programme Management guidelines. 
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP and ATCM on its members’ activities. In addition, IAATO Members remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
