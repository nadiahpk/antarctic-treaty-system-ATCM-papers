Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in Ushuaia during the 2014/2015 Austral summer season 
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2014/2015 Austral summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. Also, it identifies the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the port of Ushuaia, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships. 
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic shipborne tourism, concentrating more than 90% of the worldwide shipborne Antarctic tourist activity.   
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend their Antarctic operating schedules.  
With respect to the vessels that operate from Ushuaia, a distinction should be made between those that make landings and those of a much larger size which just sail Antarctic waters without landing passengers. Similarly, a further distinction should be made between those vessels that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American and Antarctic itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia as the port of base from which they run their Antarctic voyages. As regards the latter case, operations carried out in Ushuaia in general terms refer to passenger turnaround, port and land services as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist services. Finally, it should be noted that at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic tourist season most vessels arrive at the port of Ushuaia and/or depart therefrom on a positioning voyage from or towards other destinations.
In order to present the status of Antarctic tourist flows of visitors and vessels in Ushuaia in the 2014/2015 season, data was collected from the manifests1 provided by cruise ships to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority). This information was compared to itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained from enquiries whenever needed. With regard to these sources of information a database is built for each Antarctic tourist season.
This document updates the data given in similar papers presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting since 2009, providing information that may contribute with different aspects of discussions related to the Antarctic tourism issue.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that operated through Ushuaia during the 2014/2015 Austral summer season 
Austral summer season started on November 1st when the MV Plancius (Oceanwide Expeditions) departed from Ushuaia to Antarctica, and finished on April 3rd with the arrival of the MV Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions). A total of 2092 voyages run by 28 vessels took place, including smaller ones like the SV Bark Europa and the MY Hanse Explorer. January was the busiest month as regards the number of Antarctic voyages (26 %) followed by December (See Figure 1).

A total of 36.625 visitors went to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2014/2015 season. Of these, three categories may be identified: a) those that both departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is to say, passengers who were in Ushuaia once either on arrival or departure- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports (See Table 1). In the first case (a), passengers were counted only upon departure from Ushuaia. In the second case (b), several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, and some visited Antarctica as part of the voyage of the beginning or end of the season, and then operated from Ushuaia the rest of the time; in this instance the passengers who arrived at or departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account. Finally, in the last case (c), the vessels in transit which travelled to the Antarctic Peninsula as part of a longer voyage in South America or a more extensive itinerary. Passengers in transit were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the case when calling at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. A distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Therefore, taking into account the average number of passengers on board, it is noticed that 24 vessels were cruise ships that carried up to 500 or fewer passengers whereas 4 vessels carried more than 500 passengers. The latter category transported a total of 9.487 passengers, representing the 26% of the total of passengers who visited Antarctica through Ushuaia. An average number of crew members and passengers3 as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in Table 2; and in Figure 2 passenger averages per vessel are shown.

With regard to vessels in transit in Ushuaia, most of them are large cruise ships, which cruise Antarctic waters but do not make passenger landings in Antarctica. As previously stated, these cruise ships are on itineraries round southern South America or on more extensive voyages, and on certain itineraries, they include a visit to Antarctica. Most of these cruise ships run “pendular” voyages along Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3 provides an overview of these cruise ships through Ushuaia including the number of crew and passengers per voyage and indicating if the visit to Antarctica was before or after the port call in Ushuaia.

Furthermore, 17 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account for 61 % of the total number of vessels which were analized. Each of these vessels made between 7 and 14 voyages to Antarctica, as indicated in Figure 3. It is worth noting that the MV Ocean Nova (Antarctica XXI), MV Polar Pioneer (Aurora Expeditions) and MS Sea Adventurer (Quark Expeditions), had a different deployment in December, January and February, when they also conducted voyages from 25 de Mayo Island, embarking passengers whose arrivals and departures were from Punta Arenas (Chile) by airplane.

As regards visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers were noted. In this respect, more than 70 nationalities were identified. Most of the passengers are from the United States, followed by Australia, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Switzerland, Japan and New Zealand, among others. Percentages are presented in Figure 4. 
With regard to Measure 15 (2009), adopted at the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one guide every 20 passengers, we have identified expedition staff members who were included either on the crew or on the passenger lists. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, staff members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the landing activities. Only staff members on board vessels that carry up to 500 passengers have been considered. In most voyages, expedition staff is included in the passenger manifest and, in fewer cases, they are included in the crew manifest; in some cases they are listed on both and in other cases staff is not specified (See Table 4). In this respect, it is worth mentioning that their position on board is stated only when they are on the crew manifest.

According to the registers of vessels that operated in Antarctica throughout this season from Ushuaia, we observed, on the one hand, that among the States of register of those vessels, 4 are Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (France, Netherlands, Norway and Russian Federation) and, on the other hand, 6 are not an Antarctic Treaty Party (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia, Malta and Union of the Comoros) (See Figure 5). A summary of the number of voyages carried out by these vessels, taking into account their State of register is provided. While 63% of the voyages correspond to States or territories of register which are not a Consultative Party, the other 37% correspond to Consultative Parties. (See Figure 6).

Concluding remarks
The information presented in this document contributes to identify the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the port of Ushuaia in the 2014/2015 summer season, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships.
In comparison with the last season hardly any variations are observed. The total number of passengers who visited Antarctica through Ushuaia decreased 1,45%, during the 2014/2015 season. The number of vessels also decreased in one and the number of voyages were fewer, passing from 211 to 209. Vessels that carried more than 500 passengers had the same behaviour as in the 2013/2014 season with 7 voyages corresponding to 4 vessels, showing a difference of 210 passengers less in the last season.
The data herein presented is a source of information that aims to contribute, as alternative and supplementary data to currently available sources, in the assessment of shipborne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with special emphasis on those tourist vessels that call at the port of Ushuaia.
Finally, this paper is a useful source of information to further studies and a contribution to discussion and/or preparation of management measures in the ATCM, such as the work currently in progress in the Tourism Working Group.
