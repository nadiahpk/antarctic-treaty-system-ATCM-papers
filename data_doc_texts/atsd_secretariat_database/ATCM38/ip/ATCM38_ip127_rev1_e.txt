Non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels that travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2014/2015 season
Summary
The aim of the present document is to report on the non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels that travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2014/2015 season. Pleasure and/or sport vessels that visited Antarctica through Ushuaia were taken into account.
Introduction
In the last few years, maritime tourism to Antarctica has evolved, offering various new themes and activities. In this respect, particular interest has been observed in the demand for visits to the Antarctic Peninsula area on board pleasure and/or sport vessels.
Pleasure and/or sport vessels are considered to include any vessel that does not intend to engage in commercial activities and is used exclusively for recreation or sporting activities.
The city of Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the extreme southern tip of South America, offers a commercial pier and the anchorage of the Fuegian Association for Subaquatic and Nautical Activities where some of the yachts and sailing boats visiting Antarctica during the southern summer season put into port. 
A report on the non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2014/2015 season is presented. To this end we consulted the documentation of these vessels filed at the Argentina Naval Prefecture, the Argentine Maritime authority. 

Voyages to Antarctica made by pleasure and/or sport boats through Ushuaia
Between November and March (2014/2015) 12 pleasure or sport boats went to Antarctica from Ushuaia, transporting 188 persons (See table 1). For this type of vessels, the season started on November 25th with the departure of the sailing boat SV Icebird from Ushuaia to Antarctica, and finished on March 1st with the departure of the SV Australis. Most voyages took place during January and February.
Among all the sailing vessels mentioned, 9 registers were identified, of which 8 correspond to States that are Consultative Parties of the Antarctic Treaty: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Netherlands, Russian Federation and United Kingdom (Cayman Islands) and 1 to a Non-Consultative Party (Switzerland) (See Figure 1). The number of voyages made according to each register was also calculated (See Figure 2).
