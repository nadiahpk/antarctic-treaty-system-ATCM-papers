Workshop on Education and Outreach - South Africa’s Antarctic Education and Outreach Activities










South Africa’s Antarctic Education and Outreach Activities
Information Paper submitted by South Africa
Summary
The paper outlines the education and outreach activities undertaken by South Africa. 
Introduction
Although the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP) has no formally structured education and outreach strategy, it does make full and effective use of opportunities which arise from time to time, as well as during annual celebratory events. Here follows a brief summary of our activities:  
South Africa’s education and outreach related activities 
Library, Exhibits and Materials
    • Collection of local and international publications (scientific reports, theses, newsletters, magazine articles, books, etc.) in the Library based at the Department of Environment Affairs (DEA) in Pretoria;
    • Permanent exhibit at the Pieter Stoker Centre at the DEA in Cape Town and at the SANAE IV Station in Antarctica; 

    • Exhibitions and presentations during annual World Ocean Day (Durban, Port St Johns, Cape Town and Eastern Cape), National Marine Week (Cape Town and Port Elizabeth), World Environmental Day and SA Agulhas II Open Day (Cape Town and Port Elizabeth);

    • Hosting of guided tours of the SANAP research and supply vessel;

    • General information available on the official SANAP website:
    • www.sanap.ac.za;

    • Photographic and video material available on the SANAP website:
    • www.sanap.ac.za/sanap_sanae/sanae_base_gallery.html;

    • Comprehensive collection of photographic material available at SANAP Offices in Pretoria and Cape Town; and

    • SANAP promoted by funded scientists including our activities in their local and international talks to promote visibility, science awareness and science career opportunities.


Interactions with Media 
    • During SA Agulhas II annual open day and during annual departure and arrival ceremonies for the Antarctic, Marion and Gough Island relief voyages, SANAP activities receive substantial coverage in the printed and broadcast media. 
Activities for Schools
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    • Occasional interaction between schools and stations on a question and answer basis. Educational visits to a number of schools every year through direct invitation or as part of annual celebrations (Midwinter, World Environment Day, National Marine Week, etc.). 

    • Hosting of school guided tours of the SANAP research and Supply vessel, SA Agulhas II during annual open day and throughout the year.

    • As part of a SANAP funded project which deploys bio-optics profiling floats into the Southern Ocean the floats form part of the "Adopt a Float" programme whereby a school / class adopts an oceanographic profiling float and follows its scientific voyage over the year/s deployment. The trajectory of the float brings the students into an oceanic zone (in our case the Southern Ocean) and, in real-time, allows them to participate in the observations collected by the floats and sciences that are associated with them. One of the objectives of this project is to favour collaboration between the scientific and educational worlds in order to elaborate a teaching method for raising consciousness of school children to the marine environment.


Other

    • The Antarctic Legacy of South Africa (ALSA) is a three-year (2015-2017) SANAP funded project. ALSA's primary role is to gather and archive electronically historical information relating to South Africa's involvement over the years in the Antarctic region, including the continent, sub-Antarctic Islands (primarily the Prince Edwards and Gough, but also Bouvet) and at sea in the Southern Ocean. Material collected and archived include photographs, videos, oral interviews along with their transcripts, newspaper clippings, articles from popular magazines, bibliographies of scientific literature, PDFs of scanned articles in scientific journals not available electronically, governmental and other papers obtained from departmental, national and Antarctic archives in South Africa, Australia, UK and the USA, unpublished diaries, artwork and maps and other published and unpublished materials gleaned from governmental departments, libraries and museums within and outside of South Africa. The project's archival database is hosted by the J.S. Gericke Library at Stellenbosch University. Creating awareness within South Africa of the nation's activities and its history on involvement "down South", especially among the youth, will form a significant part of ALSA's work over the next three years. Activities will be primarily addressed at the tertiary level of education, commencing this year with attending and contributing to university open days.
    • Occasional articles published in the in-house DEA quarterly publications and magazines.

Social Media

    • ALSA Facebook page

Closing remarks

South Africa is committed to the furtherance of informing its citizens of its Antarctic endeavours, including within the international context, via continued education and outreach activities.
