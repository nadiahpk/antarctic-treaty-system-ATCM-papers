Antarctic Scientific Agenda of Colombia
2014 - 2035

Background
Colombia, aware of the importance of Antarctica, is adherent to the Antarctic Treaty since 1989, and presented at the XXXVI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the document called IP 104, in which reported the intention to make its first scientific expedition to the white continent, during the austral summer of 2014/15.

The CTNAA1 was created and coordinated by the CCO2, in order to support the CN AA3, in technical and scientific issues.

During 2013 and 2014, within the framework of the activities of CTNAA, the CCO in its role as one of the agencies responsible for planning and coordination of programs and projects in Colombia in the Antarctic Continent, precisely according to Decree 1690 of 1990, issued by the Colombian State, the CCO structured in concert with the members of this Committee, the Scientific Agenda of Colombia Antarctic 2014-2035, following the guidelines in Antarctic science and under international framework, which is expected to be updated according to the needs and new guidelines for Antarctic science, as well as the guidelines of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research -SCAR, and programs of their respective groups and committees.

    1. Vision 

Scientific Agenda of Antarctic Affairs of Colombia, will be projected as the base document for the strategic direction of scientific, technological and innovation activities in the country, in order to assist with the global scientific research projects, peace, and security in the 'White Continent', through its own permanent research station.


    2. Mission 

The Scientific Agenda of Antarctic Affairs of Colombia, is the guiding document for planning, development, evaluation for scientific research and technological innovation, that the country plans to perform in Antarctica. 


    3. General Purpose

To implement the necessary guidelines addressed to institutions and universities for allowing them to execute continuous research in Antarctica, either with their own platforms, platforms or bases of other countries, or from the theoretical field, seeking precisely that Colombia generates knowledge, to contribute to solving current and future problems, and make contributions to the Antarctic Treaty System.

    4. Strategic Priorities

    • Promote the development of scientific research by Colombia in Antarctica, focusing the work on the priorities and needs of the country in the field of science and technological innovation.
    • Conduct efforts to achieve political objectives that Colombia has over Antarctica, implementing continuously and relevant research, in order to become a consultative country in terms of the Antarctic Treaty.
    • Prepare highly qualified human resources, to be recognized nationally and internationally, in order to lead the Colombian scientific research and its technological innovation in Antarctica.
    • Represent the country in different stages on Antarctic issues, and advice the Government on the decisions to be taken. Particularly in the consolidation of scientific matters as a strategic element in the foreign policy of Colombia.
    • Establish agreements, alliances and other forms of technical, logistical and scientific cooperation, create networks of national and international work, to promote the transfer and acquisition of knowledge and technology.
    • Contribute to preserve peace and security in Antarctica, through scientific research and technological innovation.


    5.   Goals

Colombia has established, as short, medium and long term goals, the following:

    • 2014: Carry out the First Scientific Expedition, with own vessel in the Antarctic continent, implementing research projects on the lines of Climatology and Meteorology, Physical and Biological Oceanography, Marine Engineering and Human Physiology.

    • In 2025: Colombia expects to have a seasonal research station, and be a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty System.

    • 2035: Colombia expects to have a permanent station in order to perform throughout scientific research the year, investigation that will be fundamental base for scientific research projects and technological innovation, to develop in Antarctica.

This instrument will be updated every four years.


    6. Components of the Agenda

The proposed topics are the result of the agreement between the entities belonging to the CTNAA.

The thematic areas that were determined correspond to those established at the Latin America level, and also attends to the national interests within Antarctica. During the validity of these guidelines is possible that it raises new things, necessities, and technologies for research in Antarctica; that is the reason why this document will be updated for reflecting those changing priorities.

The guidelines of international bodies such as SCAR, research trends in other strategic countries, major gaps in existing information, the specific needs and capacities of Colombia, will be the guide for updating this document.

The thematic areas of the Colombian Antarctic Science Agenda are:

    • Maritime transportation and Naval industry
    • Basic Knowledge: Geography, Hydrography, Oceanography and Cartography
    • Maritime safety
    • Relations between South America and Antarctica
    • Biodiversity of Antarctic Organisms
    • Marine, Coastal and Continental Ecosystems: Environmental Change and Conservation.
    • Climate Change and Climate evolution 
    • Adaptation to the Antarctic Environment. Valuation and use of its bio-resources.
    • Environment and Other Initiatives

    7. Action Plan

The Action Plan is based on the Antarctic Scientific Agenda of Colombia, and will constitute a planning tool for monitoring and evaluation of the objectives, strategic priorities and goals.Therefore, it proposes a way to achieve the strategic goals and set priorities herein, prioritizing the most important initiatives in the short, medium and long term.

The Action Plan must be settled for programs, projects, time and responsible, establishing a duty to be examined each year by the CTNAA, without prejudice to the different action plans of the entities that conform the Committee.
