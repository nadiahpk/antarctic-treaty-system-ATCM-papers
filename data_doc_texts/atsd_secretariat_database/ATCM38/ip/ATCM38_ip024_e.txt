Code of Conduct for Activities within Terrestrial Geothermal Environments in Antarctica










Code of Conduct for Activities within Terrestrial Geothermal Environments in Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States
Summary
In August 2014, prior to the SCAR Open Science Conference XXXIII, Auckland, New Zealand, New Zealand and the United States convened a workshop to discuss the need to develop guidelines for working in geothermal areas in Antarctica.  The Workshop was attended by 20 scientists and policy makers from eight Treaty Parties (Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and United States). The workshop noted the potential for conflicting interests between different users of geothermal environments in Antarctica (e.g. geologists, microbiologists, tourists), and recommended that guidelines to best practice be developed in cooperation with SCAR.
Working Paper 35 introduces a draft Code of Conduct for Activities within Terrestrial Geothermal Environments in Antarctica, based on the discussions held at the workshop and subsequent consultations.
This Information Paper provides the report of the Auckland workshop for the additional information of the Committee.  This report was submitted to the meetings of SCAR's Standing Scientific Groups on Life Sciences and GeoSciences, which met in Auckland in August 2014, and which encouraged further development of the code of conduct.

SHORT REPORT FOR SCAR LIFE SCIENCES AND GEOSCIENCES STANDING GROUPS
Introduction
Geothermal areas are known to support unique and diverse biological communities and may be at risk from introduced species through human activity in these areas. NZ and the USA organised a workshop on the margins of the SCAR Open Science Conference XXXIII, Auckland, New Zealand to follow up on Recommendation 6 "encourage scientists, interested Parties, and SCAR to work together to develop appropriate guidance material for geothermal areas in Antarctica" from WP 38 submitted to ATCM XXXV/CEP XV, 2012. 
This workshop brought together 20 scientists and policy makers from eight Treaty Parties (Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, UK and USA) to discuss the need to develop guidelines for working in geothermal areas in Antarctica.
Discussion of rationale for guidelines
There are more than 40 known volcanoes in Antarctica. Of these, there are 4 known active volcanoes with geothermal habitats south of 60S; Mount Erebus (including the Erebus Ice Caves), Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittmann in the Ross Sea and Deception Island, South Shetland Islands on the Antarctic Peninsula. It is expected that investigation of geothermal habitats in Marie Byrd Land will be of interest in the future.
At many of these sites there are conflicts of interest. At Deception Island there is tourism, different scientific interests (biology, geology and volcanology), and station activity. On Mount Erebus, there are different scientific interests, media, station personnel visits and possible interest from tourists in the future. On Mount Melbourne, there is scientific activity and station activity (repeater installation). 
Environmental impacts at these sites have already occurred. For example, some Erebus Ice Caves have been assessed and found to have a variety of contamination from historic activities and Deception Island has a long history of visitation (e.g. historic whaling stations and tourism) with associated impacts.
Nevertheless, investigations at these sites have found them to have unique biological communities (with many endemic species) and an appropriate environment (pH, temperature, geochemistry) to support any heterotroph which might inadvertently be brought into the environment through human visitation.
The ad hoc geothermal group agreed that as a precautionary approach to minimise the risk of introducing non-native species to these environments, simple cost effective methods should be identified and drafted into useful guidance material for future activity at these and other geothermal sites – possibly even sub-Antarctic geothermal sites.
Identification of Protocols
Protocols have been developed and implemented for working in geothermal environments in ASPA 140: Parts of Deception Island, South Shetland Islands; ASMA 4 Deception Island; ASPA 175: High altitude geothermal sites in the Ross Sea region; and the Interim Code of Conduct for working in the Erebus Ice Caves.
A set of guidelines for common practice in geothermal areas outside of the ASPAs is needed. Any guidelines developed need to be cost efficient and simple to implement for them to be effective. They need to address the risk of introducing new organisms from outside an area into an area (human introduction), but also moving organisms within an area (cross contamination). 

Noting that many of the geothermal sites have conflicting interests (tourism, station management and different types of science) and various environment factors (e.g. high altitude is difficult to work; ice cave environment is unique) a single solution for all geothermal sites will likely not be possible. 
In general, the ad hoc geothermal group thought the guideline structure might include a preamble of why the protocols are needed, a short bullet point list that is applicable to all sites and further guidance for specific sites. The group discussed how such guidelines would be implemented and noted that the SCAR Codes of Conduct (e.g. overflight of birds, terrestrial field activities and use of animals in experiments in the field) would be the preferred model. 
Recommendation
Inform the SCAR Life Sciences Standing Groups (LSSG) and the Geo Sciences Standing Groups (GSSG) of the outcome of this workshop. In particular, highlight that the ad hoc geothermal group would like the SSGs to comment on the process proposed to move the work forward and to participate in the development of the guidelines, with the goal of SCAR endorsement of the guidelines at its next meeting.
