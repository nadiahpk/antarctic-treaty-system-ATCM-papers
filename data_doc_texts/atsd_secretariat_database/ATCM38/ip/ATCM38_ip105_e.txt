Antarctic Education and Outreach activities in Bulgaria

Information Paper submitted by Bulgaria

Summary
This paper notes that Bulgaria and in particular Bulgarian Antarctic Institute (BAI) have recognized the need for continuous public and educational outreach related with the Polar Regions in the last fifteen years. The paper defines the education and outreach activities undertaken by Bulgaria since 2000, involving the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS Bulgaria) and some national educational organizations in projects as “Antarctica in your school”, "Antarctic Arts" and “Polar Science Communication”.
Introduction 
Antarctic education and outreach activities in Bulgaria are important because they inform the general public and early career scientists on the uniqueness and global role of the Antarctic, as well as on its environmental protection by the Antarctic Treaty. They also foster scientific curiosity and highlight the importance of scientific research in Antarctica to global problems, thus inspiring the future generations of researchers. Here we describe work related to Antarctic education carried out by Bulgaria since 2000.
Bulgaria’s education and outreach related activities since 2000

Over these fifteen years Bulgarian Antarctic Institute held many cultural activities such as book premieres, artistic and photographic exhibitions, TV films and philately postage stamps related with Antarctic. BAI also started an educational and outreach program willing to spread its knowledge and polar experiences in Bulgarian schools and Universities around the country. 

The project “Antarctic Arts” was established in the early 90’s of the 20th century as some of the members of the first Bulgarian Antarctic expeditions were not only researchers but also talented artists. The project provides opportunities for artists in different fields (painting, photography, writing, history and other arts) to work in Antarctica. The purpose is to enable serious writings and the arts that increase understanding of the Antarctic and help to document Bulgaria's Antarctic heritage. Artists’ creative work over all these years until today gives many possibilities for education and outreach Polar activities for the schools and the general public, including: 
    • Photographic and painting exhibitions – since 2000 more than thirty different artists visited Bulgarian Antarctic Base. Their photographs and paintings depict the wild life of South Shetland Islands and the life and work of Bulgarian teams during the Antarctic campaigns. Every year Bulgaria organizes more than five photo exhibitions with new photos from Antarctica that are traveling for educational purposes around the country. In 2012 three Bulgarian photos won the SCAR/COMNAP photo competition.
    • Historical books, novels and travel diaries – the production of professional-quality literature and art aims to increase public understanding of the Antarctic continent, the surrounding oceans, and human activities there, as well as the region's unique geopolitical and other characteristics. Since 2000 thirteen books from Bulgarian and foreign writers were written in the Bulgarian Antarctic Base and some of them very soon became bestsellers. The last book has been published in April 2015.
    • Antarctic Museum within the National Museum of History in Sofia - permanent exhibition on the Bulgarian activities in Antarctica. It shows the history of Bulgarian presence on the White continent and the present view of Bulgarian Antarctic Base with many everyday objects, diaries, personal belongings and scientific discoveries.
    • Documentary films and TV series – more than ten movies and six TV series have been filmed in the last years and were broadcast on the national televisions. They study people who live and work at the bottom of the planet, in Antarctica, but also explore their dreams and capture footage of the continent's unique locations. Some of the films won awards at Documentary Film Festivals.
    • Postage Stamps - Bulgaria has issued Antarctic themed postage stamps in occasion of 10th and 20th Bulgarian Antarctic Expeditions in 2002 and 2012, respectively. All of them are valid for postage in Bulgaria but were used also in the post office Antarctica 1090 that operated at the Bulgarian base since the 1994/95 season in compliance with standard Bulgarian postal regulations and procedures.
The project “Polar Science Communication” was established in 2000 as a recognition of the power of mass media for promoting Antarctic activities in Bulgaria. Mass media play a crucial role as a source of information, in encouraging knowledge and concern about environmental problems and also helps to explain to the tax-payers how their country's contribution to Antarctic research is serving science and society. BAI becomes a communication link between Antarctic science and general public. Bulgarian polar explorers explain quite often the objectives of their research and the successful activities before the public to foster understanding and goodwill. The result is hundreds of news items and articles in the newspapers, TV and radio reports and interviews, TV documentary films and series showing the increasing importance of Antarctic issues in Bulgaria. 
Since 2012 Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) Bulgaria joined with more ideas about working with local media to inform, educate and sensitize students and kids about the environmental issues.

The project “Antarctic in your school” was established in 2005 as part of long-term educational and outreach program directed at Bulgarian schools, kindergartens and Universities around the country. It aims to inform the different publics about the importance of Antarctic research and to improve their knowledge about Polar Regions.
Bulgaria joined the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) in 2012, was part of its Executive Committee 2013/2014 and is currently its active member. Since 2014 APECS Bulgaria is a registered non-profit organization that works closely with Bulgarian Antarctic Institute. Both organizations collaborate very successfully in education, outreach and scientific projects with other partner organizations as British Council-Bulgaria, Spanish Institute Cervantes, National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of History etc.
Numerous education and outreach polar activities are undertaken by Bulgaria:
    • Public and school talks - bringing members of Bulgarian Antarctic expeditions and Antarctic artists into classrooms through talks, skype calls and multimedia presentations. Interaction with early career polar scientists was stimulated by engaging with talks scientists from APECS Bulgaria too. More than 3000 students, 51 teachers, 32 schools, 21 scientists were involved in this project which is integrated with celebration of International Polar Weeks and Antarctica Day in Bulgaria. Bulgarian children from 16 schools drew designs of Antarctic flag. Their drawings reached the White Continent together with children’s drawings from 31 countries and were exhibited in front of the Bulgarian Antarctic Base on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.
    • Travelling educational exhibitions – within this year-round initiative several photographic exhibitions tour the schools in the country presenting the history of Bulgarian polar research, discoveries and daily life in Antarctica.
    • National contest for children “What I know about Antarctica”. Participants were between 7-16 years old and could write a narrative or produce a piece of art. More than 300 drawings and 100 essays were submitted. Prizes were provided by the sponsorship of one of the Bulgarian banks.

    • Participation in Sofia Science Festival – each year since 2012 Bulgarian polar science is one of the main topics during the biggest educational science event in Bulgaria – the annual four-day Sofia Science Festival. BAI and APECS Bulgaria teamed up with British Council to promote polar science communication including interesting scientific experiments, talks about polar explorers, polar books and films, funny polar games and quizzes for kids and the general public.

    • Celebrating the centenaries of Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton's epic expeditions. The initiative included educational public and school talks, audio visual performances for blind and visually impaired people, translating and publishing of documentary foreign bestseller books about the polar explorers.

    • Polar fairs in collaboration with partner organizations in different occasions throughout the year: (e.g. on the occasion of 125th anniversary of National Museum of Natural History a “Polar Day” has been organized in the museum’s halls. The activities included charity photographic exhibition "Antarctica - the cold South" - the funds raised were used for creating new interactive educational programs for students in the museum APECS Bulgaria's team participated also with Antarctic talks program, Polar creative studio for kids and “Scientific Casino”. Another example is the workshop "Polar Space Challenges" in the Fun Maths Centre in Sofia. The children constructed a  paper model of the International Space Station and tagged its real time orbit revolution around the Earth. Their photos participated and won the monthly European Space Agency Competition.

Bulgaria is supporting strongly the idea of networking and meeting young researchers from APECS National Committees around the world. Therefore Bulgaria is proud to be a host of the First APECS World Summit "The Future of Polar Research" which coincides with the Annual ATCM and will be held at the Sofia University 6-8 June 2015. The APECS World Summit is an initiative to bring representatives of APECS' leadership and National Committees together to discuss the future of polar research, APECS' experiences in communicating science and new challenges APECS wants to tackle in the near future. Integrated in the summit are workshops covering three key topics: polar data sharing and open science, science communication and education & outreach initiatives and the APECS network and its future directions.
