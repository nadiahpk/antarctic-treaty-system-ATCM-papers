IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2013-14, 2014-15 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2015-16 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
As in previous years, IAATO is pleased to provide estimates of Antarctic tourism from IAATO operators for the 2015-16 season and the statistical data from the Post Visit Reports for the just-concluded 2014-15 season. Due to the early timing of ATCM XXXVII in 2014, IAATO was unable to provide the detail of the 2013-14 season; this information is also included here.  
These estimates are based on information provided to IAATO by its operators as of April 20, 2015. These numbers reflect only those travelling with IAATO member companies and do not include those individuals taking part in research projects that are being supported by IAATO operators. 
Preliminary numbers indicate that the general picture for 2014-15 season (36,702 persons) was similar to that forecast in ATCM XXXVII IP103 IAATO Preliminary Estimates for 2014-15 Season, and slightly lower than the final figures for the 2013-14 season (37,405 persons). Forecasts for 2015-16 indicate that the numbers will rise to approximately 40,029 individuals. 
1.0	Overview
While this section focuses on the detail of the 2014-15 season’s information, detailed information on all completed seasons, including details on activities and landing site use, will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under Guidelines and Resources, Tourism Statistics. Additionally selected site-specific information is also available in ATCM XXXVIII IP85 Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2013-14 and 2014-15 Season.
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
IAATO’s Membership continues to incorporate the majority of private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS passenger ship operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area are currently members of IAATO. All of these operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.

Final analysis of Post Visit Reports for the 2014-15 season indicates that there was a slight decrease in the overall tourism statistics from the 2013-14 season. Ship borne tourism remains dominant on the Peninsula and no passengers participated in IAATO operator over-flights to the Antarctic continent. 

1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourism activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, snorkeling, skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays), running events, helicopter operations and underwater ROVs. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. 
The 2014-15 season however did see the use of ‘drones’ or Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs), small remotely operated flight vehicles which can be fitted with cameras for aerial photography. Information on IAATO policies on UAV flights can be found in ATCM XXXVIII IP88 IAATO Policies on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Antarctica.

The vast majority of tourism voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from November to March), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Antarctic Treaty Area. 
1.3	Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more than 100 different nationalities were represented in tourists who visited the Antarctic during both the 2013-14 and 2014-15 season. In both years the majority came from the same 8 different countries (see Table 2).

1.4	IAATO Member-Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels and Yachts
Detailed information of the activities conducted during 2014-15 season are listed in Appendix 2, and anticipated activities for the 2015-16 season can be found in Appendix 3. All activities are permitted or authorized through the Environmental Impact Assessments and Advance Notifications submitted in advance of the season. All activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and nearly all activities have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for more than a decade. 
1.5	Commercial Deep Field Tourism 
Four IAATO operators conducted deep field tourism activities during the 2014-15 season: 
    • Adventure Network International / Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) – one of the founding members of IAATO in 1991 – conducted activities for the 29th consecutive season. 
    • The Antarctic Company (TAC) operated in Antarctica for the 10th consecutive season and 6th as an IAATO operator. 
    • White Desert (WDL), which operated in Antarctica for the 9th  consecutive season and 4th as an IAATO operator. Flights and logistics for WDL are coordinated through TAC. 
    • Arctic Trucks, which joined IAATO at the end of the 2013-14 season has operated in the Antarctic as a contractor since the 1990’s.  The 2014-15 season was their 1st season as an authorised operator in their own right.
ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and WDL operated out of Cape Town, South Africa. Arctic Trucks supported operations working from both ALE and TAC camps.
The four companies employed experienced guides; over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in the field.
1.5.1	Visitor & Staff Numbers
Details of the visitor numbers can be found in the appendices below. Deep field operators usually maintain a higher than requisite client to staff ratio – often in the region of 1 guide to 3 clients. The exception is with solo expeditions, for example on South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are supported remotely through communication protocols, air drops and agreed search and rescue plans etc. 
1.5.2	Aircraft Operations
ALE:
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, fuel, staff, guides and passengers from SCCI Punta Arenas to SCGC Runway 18M Union Glacier. 
    • Two ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and one ski-equipped Douglas DC3-PT67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the Antarctic season.
TAC: 
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to support a medical evacuation to Cape Town, South Africa
    • One Douglas DC3-PT67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the Antarctic season

1.5.3 	Ground Transport
    • ALE operated a number of tractor traverses, primarily for more efficient transport of fuel and cargo, and to support scientific activities.
    • ALE, TAC, WDL and Arctic Trucks all used modified wheel vehicles. 

1.5.4	Camps (Primary)
    • ALE Union Glacier Camp opened October 17, 2014 and closed February 14, 2015.
    • TAC Camp opened November 9, 2014 and closed on February 26, 2015.
    • WDL Camp opened November 9, 2014 and closed on January 12, 2015.

1.5.5	Programs and Activities
Activities including the operation of standard programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions, and logistical support of other expeditions for the 2014-15 season, are outlined in the table below. Total numbers participating include clients from all four IAATO deep field operators. Note that some clients participated in multiple programs.

1.6	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members

For the 2014-15 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO members.
2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2015-16 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2015-16 season.
IAATO operators continue to refine the detail of their activity reporting. Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats, shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, snorkelling, skiing, snowboarding, stand-up paddle boarding, camping (including short overnight stays), helicopter operations, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and underwater remote operated vehicles (ROVs).
For the 2015-16 season, those tourism categories where passengers land ashore – traditional small and medium-size expedition ships and yachts, all carrying 500 or fewer passengers – is expected to reach 30,634 passengers. The increase is due to two principle factors: an increase in air/cruise tourism which will increase to 2,294 clients; and the introduction to the market of two new vessels Ocean Endeavour and Le Lyrial both of which anticipate carrying approximately 200 passengers and conducting circa 10 voyages. 
Cruise-only tourism, aboard 500-plus passenger vessels with no passengers landing ashore, is projecting a slight decrease to 8,900 passengers. Air-land tourism, which is conducted by the four IAATO Members that provide deep field excursions and expeditions, is projected to reach 531 visitors.
No over-flights by IAATO operators are expected during the 2015-16 season.
IAATO members will continue to work together so that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that tourism activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
