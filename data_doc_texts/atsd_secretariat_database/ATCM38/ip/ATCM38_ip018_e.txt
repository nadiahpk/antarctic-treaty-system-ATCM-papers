Workshop on Education and Outreach
Cultural Contest - “Brasil in Antarctica”
Information Paper submitted by Brazil

Introduction
Education and outreach activities are of key importance to raise awareness among the public on the activities governments carry out in Antarctica. 
In 2013, in order to reach out to youngsters, a nationwide cultural "contest" - entitled "Brazil in Antarctica" – was organized by the Brazilian Navy. In order to promote awareness about the importance of the continent among future generations, the target audience of the activity were high school students from 15 to 19 year old.  
The contest
The proposed theme of the contest was to reflect on the role and influence Brazil may play in Antarctica, taking into account the country´s political, environmental, economic and social interests and priorities in the area. Participants were asked to produce a 3 minute video about their view of Antarctica, its uniqueness and its challenges. 
More than 200 videos were submitted by students from all over Brazil.  Four students were selected - 2 from public schools and 2 from private schools. As a prize, the winners were taken to Antarctica, together with one of their teachers. 
Visiting Antarctica
The chosen participants were enrolled in the Pre-Antarctic Training, where they became familiar with the activities carried out on the continent and, most importantly, with safety and environmental procedures.
In Antarctica, the group visited the Brazilian provisional station and was able to understand how research is carried out by Brazil on that continent.










Repercussion
The contest and the journey itself were largely broadcasted by Brazil´s biggest television channel, reaching out to a large and diversified audience.
