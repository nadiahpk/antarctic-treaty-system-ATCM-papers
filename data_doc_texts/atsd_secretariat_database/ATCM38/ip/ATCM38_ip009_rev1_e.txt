Making an Impact: National Antarctic Program Activities which Facilitate Education and Outreach
Summary
The Council of Manager of National Antarctic Program (COMNAP)-member programs have a commitment to communicating their countries’ Antarctic story at a national level. This commitment involves a wide range of ways in which to deliver that story, requires funds and staff in support of such activities, and involves long-term government support, all to educate and influence public attitudes towards supporting Antarctic investment. In preparation for the ATCM Education and Outreach Workshop, COMNAP gathered information on education and outreach activities facilitated by each national Antarctic program.  This paper presents a compilation of the gathered information. The results demonstrate that the range of education and outreach activity currently facilitated by national Antarctic programs or made possible in partnership with national Antarctic programs is significant. The paper also discusses COMNAPs role in supporting national Antarctic programs to exchange information and ideas on education, communication, public engagement and outreach.  
COMNAP’s Role
The “…digital revolution catapulted all of us into the fast-paced and complex ‘Information Age’”1.  As a result, within many national Antarctic programs, employment positions for outreach, media, and public communications staff have been established with many national Antarctic programs having a department or division which focuses on outreach and education activities. Recognising this, in 1998, COMNAP held the “Forum on Education and Training”, in Concepcion, Chile, and COMNAP established the Information Officers Network (INFONET) that became an opportunity especially for science communicators to work across national Antarctic programs to develop policies, ideas and strategies related to this new discipline. 
INFONET held successful workshops in 2005 (Sofia, Bulgaria), 2006 (Washington, D.C., USA), and 2008 (St. Petersburg, Russia) and the 2007 COMNAP meeting record notes national Antarctic program collaborative outreach activities facilitated through INFONET during 2006–07 included an Oden outreach cruise (Sweden, New Zealand, Chile), ANDRILL outreach (Italy, Germany, New Zealand, USA) and Ice Station Antarctica (UK, Republic of Korea, Spain and USA). 
As planning for IPY developed, there was a burst of activity to develop Education, Outreach and Communications (EOC) activity and INFONET members were invited to take leading roles. In 2008, COMNAP disbanded its networks and created Expert Groups.  The Outreach & Education Expert Group was the natural evolution of INFONET. In 2010, COMNAP held an Outreach Workshop at the IPY Oslo Science Conference and COMNAP was part of the International Steering Committee for the IPY Montreal Conference in 2012.
The COMNAP Outreach and Education Expert Group remains in touch by sharing documents and ideas via an on-line forum on the member’s only area of the COMNAP website. COMNAP encourages each national Antarctic program to nominate at least one person to participate in this Expert Group.
The Impact of National Antarctic Programs 
Each national Antarctic program has, at one level or another, within their operations strategy a component of education and outreach activity. Collectively, this activity makes a considerable impact on educating the public on Antarctic matters across a range of disciplines. Often we do not find the information on Antarctic education and outreach in any one place.  This is because each country makes their own efforts at a national level to promote their work in Antarctica and many will report on their activities to this workshop. 
Looking at the activity collectively, however, makes a powerful statement and gives better understanding of the significant level of activity undertaken, its potential global impact and how we might better collaboratively showcase the activity to support broader awareness.  In preparation for the ATCM Education and Outreach Workshop, COMNAP gathered information on education and outreach activities facilitated by each national Antarctic program. The result, presented in this paper, provides a snapshot of the depth and breadth of activities facilitated by those programs making an impact to educate the public on understanding the Antarctic Treaty region, the management of that region and its importance to humanity. 
Methodology
Initial research and data collection focused on publically available information in order to assess the ease of public access to national Antarctic program outreach and education facilities and on-line materials. Individual national Antarctic program websites and published documents were searched (in English only) for information on public outreach, as well as completing a ‘Google’ search for other outreach facilities related to each national Antarctic program. Facilities were categorized under
    • Library
    • Museum/ exhibits
    • Teaching and Student Resources and/or programs
    • Regular Publications
    • Online databases
    • Image/ video 
    • Social Media
    • Other Outreach

It was also noted if the national Antarctic program managed online archives, was involved in organizing school activities and/or operating live streamed webcams from their polar research facilities.
Following initial data collection, COMNAP then contacted each national Antarctic program and asked them to review the table for information that was gathered from those public sources.  They were then given the opportunity to add or correct any information to their table of information and to add any further categories of activities. This also gave those national Antarctic programs an indication of what could be found from publicly available sources about their education and outreach activities, and therefore could assist them with their public presence. 
Results
Information gathering from national Antarctic programs was, at the time of writing this paper, continuing. Information gathered to date is included as an attachment to this document (attachment 1).  This compilation of activity is also now available to COMNAP members by way of the COMNAP Outreach Expert Group website and it is hoped the information will be regularly updated by national Antarctic programs. An overview of findings and observations is presented here.
    • National Antarctic program websites often contain a section with general background information on Antarctica.  In particular, information on weather, climate, biodiversity and research activity undertaken there; 
    • There are many on-line databases and publication lists that are easy to locate and access.  The publications databases are typically bibliographical with links to the papers published by members of national Antarctic programs, these are aimed at people likely to already be familiar with Antarctic issues;
    • Just over half of the national Antarctic programs operate or contribute to the operation of a polar museum or other permanent exhibition, these are aimed at the general public and those people likely to not already be familiar with Antarctic issues. Finding information on such facilities was not as easy to find by way of publicly available sources;
    • Education and outreach facilities varied across national Antarctic programs. This is not unexpected as the structure and size of national Antarctic programs is quite varied. Lesser level of activity need not be an indication of lesser substance of activity.  For example, putting time and effort into an annual Antarctic school fair can involve a significant number of participants as can a web pod cast series and so can create a high level of impact from a single education or outreach event.

A chart showing the number of national Antarctic programs which support physical and virtual education and outreach activity is shown below (Figure 1). “Other outreach” includes a range of occasional events and activities, such as public talks, seminars and conferences.

Summary
National Antarctic programs are the primary messengers for Antarctic information to the public offering a range of education, outreach and communications activities (see Figure 2).  Often they work together with other national governmental bodies (such as universities and national research institutes) to develop and support education and outreach initiatives and tools.  As with science support and scientific activities in the Antarctic, national Antarctic programs often work collaboratively with other national Antarctic programs on activities related to education, outreach and communication. 
Yet many national Antarctic programs do not promote their facilities via their websites and regular publications and so such activity is not as visible to the general public as it could be.   Some education and outreach is not exclusively “Antarctic” but is polar in nature, this is a reflection of the bi-polar focus of approximately half of the countries involved in Antarctic Treaty activities. There are at least fifteen first languages across the 29 COMNAP member  national Antarctic programs, so many of the websites with information are not listed in English, nor do they always have translation into at least one of the four official Antarctic Treaty languages. Therefore information may be difficult to find via web-based search engines that operate in one particular language.  Funding in support of most national Antarctic program education and outreach activities comes from within national Antarctic program budgets.  Such activities are a primary conduit of information about Antarctica to the general public.
