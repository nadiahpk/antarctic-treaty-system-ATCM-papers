Special Working Group on Competent Authorities issues – German contribution
Information Paper submitted by Germany
    1. Background
This paper has been drafted following Norway’s call to share information on issues and experiences of relevance to paragraphs III to VII of the agenda of the “Special Working Group on Competent Authorities issues”.
    2. Information to paragraphs III to VII of the agenda 
What issues have Parties’ competent authorities encountered when handling activities involving participants from multiple nations and/or multiple organisations? (para. III of the agenda)
In this context the following aspects might be relevant to consider:
    • Activities where it is unclear who or which country is the “organising country”, and thereby who is responsible for the activity:
The German competent authority, the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt - UBA) often deals with activities of German media representatives (e.g. journalists, photographers, film teams) participating in a (touristic) journey already permitted or authorised by another Party. Sometimes it is unclear whether these journalistic activities are included in the already permitted/authorised/ approved activity or whether the journalistic part is a separate activity which significantly exceeds the permitted/authorised/approved one. 
If German media representatives conduct an activity within the scope of another Party’s permit for the organised expedition, they do not have to apply for a permit in Germany. In that case UBA accepts permits of Parties to the Environmental Protocol. However, if media activities are beyond the scope of the permit for the organised expedition, they would require a separate permit. Due to a lack of awareness about relevant regulations, journalists often miss to contact UBA, or they do contact UBA which then has to examine by whom and from where the activity is organised. The German Act implementing the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty applies to German nationals, other natural persons domiciled or habitually resident in the territory of Germany, legal persons or unincorporated associations domiciled in the territory of Germany, and foreign legal persons or unincorporated associations carrying out an activity organised in Germany or proceed directly from its territory. In such cases, a close cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities can be helpful.
    •  Activities organised by non-Parties, where Party nationals are involved
UBA is experienced in cases where German media representatives take part in journeys to the Antarctic organised by a non-Party operator. If the activity of the media representatives does not exceed the organised activity they would not need a separate permit from UBA. However, the main problem is that persons taking part in these activities are often unsupervised on-site and therefore compliance with the Visitor Site Guidelines or search and rescue cannot be ensured.
What issues have Parties’ competent authorities encountered when handling activities where various elements of the activity have been handled/approved/permitted by different national authorities? (para. IV of the agenda)
In this context the following examples may be relevant to consider:
    • In the case of German media representatives participating in already permitted/authorised activities, UBA has to clarify if the activity of the media representative is covered by an appropriate permit/approval or not. If not, UBA has to clarify who is responsible for insurance or search and rescue.
    • In the case of the activities of the yacht Sarah W. Vorwerk (for more details, see ATCM XXXVIII IP 64 “The yacht Sarah W. Vorwerk within the Antarctic Treaty area during the season 2014/2015”), the question arises as to which competent authority the skipper should have had applied to for a permit. The yacht is registered in Germany and is operating under the German flag. The owner and skipper is a Dutch national who sometimes used to stay in Argentina as a tourist from where he has probably organized cruises to Antarctica. Moreover, in the season 2014/2015, a group of Russian divers had been aboard Sarah W. Vorwerk during one of its journeys. So far it could not be clarified whether the yacht or the divers had an appropriate notification or permit by any Party.
What issues have Parties’ competent authorities encountered when assessing safety issues related to activities? (para. V of the agenda)
German permits are subject to the proviso that applicants have to comply with the Measure 4 (2004) “Insurance and contingency planning for tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area” and have to submit appropriate insurance documents concerning their planned activity in the Antarctic. Within the authorisation process it is also asked for certificates of SAR-agreements. 
Tourism operators often offer activities that could be classified as risky (e.g. diving, mountain- or rock climbing, base or bungee jumping). In this context, Germany would draw attention to the following questions: 
    • How Parties handle such activities with regard to safety issues?
    • Which conditions or provisos should be considered on these issues?
    • Are there any requirements concerning safety issues which are relevant to authorisation?
What issues/challenges of wider implication have Parties’ competent authorities handled with regard to various types of activities? (para. VI of the agenda)
Germany has already permitted expeditions/journeys with various types of activities, for example: 
    • activities involving motorised vehicles in remote areas (race type activity involving two teams that went by ski and a film team that went by car to South Pole)
    • activities involving kite-skiing 
    • activities involving coastal camping and diving 
    • activities involving kayaking or stand-up-paddling
    • activities involving the use of UAVs for commercial purposes
UBA has permitted all of the above activities with the proviso to comply with special recommendations (e.g. compliance with IAATO Guidelines on camping or with the draft IAATO Guidelines for the use of UAVs), with the respective Visitor Site Guidelines and the Non-native Species Manual by COMNAP. 
Germany would like to raise the following questions: 
    • Have other Parties refused authorisation of such activities in the past? If so, for what reasons?
    • Which special permit provisos and conditions are in use among Parties in order to regulate such activities?
Have Parties’ competent authorities encountered challenges/issues considering of activities in light of the purpose and principles of the Protocol and other relevant ATCM recommendations? (para. VII of the agenda)
Germany would like to highlight the following questions within this agenda item:
    • Have Parties previously refused authorisation of touristic and non-governmental activities within the framework of the Protocol or relevant ATCM recommendations in the past?  

In 2006, UBA refused a permit for the permanent installation of a bronze sculpture in the Antarctic. In accordance with Germany’s national legislation implementing the Environment Protocol, all permitted activities have to be limited in time. The Administrative Court confirmed this decision of UBA.

In 2011, an application for collecting earth and volcanic rock from Deception Island for rock paintings was withdrawn by the applicant. This activity was considered not in line with the existing General Guidelines for Visitors to the Antarctic (i.e., "Do not take souvenirs, whether man-made, biological or geological items, including feathers, bones, eggs, vegetation, soil, rocks, meteorites or fossils.").

    • Are leisure activities of scientists and logistic staff in the Treaty Area permitted/approved/handled separately from the scientific/logistic activities?  
    3. Concluding Remarks
The information presented above on issues and experiences of relevance to the paragraphs III to VII of the agenda should be discussed during the “Special Working Group on Competent Authorities issues”.
