Special WG on Competent Authorities issues - Summary of Parties’ competent authority domestic process











Special Working Group session at ATCM XXXVIII on competent authorities issues relating to tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica – summary of Parties’ competent authority domestic process


This Information Paper presents an overview of the brief summaries on domestic process Parties have submitted as a response to our invitation contained in Circular No. 5/2015 concerning "ATCM XXXVIII Special Working Group on Competent Authorities issues". Thirteen Parties of the total of thirty seven Parties that have ratified the Environmental Protocol have responded.

The respondents have answered a set of questions presented in the Circular mentioned above. The answers have been sorted under the different question headings and a short summary/overview is provided in the heading of each question. 

It is a hope and intention that this paper will provide useful background information for the discussions in the Special Working Group Session, enhancing all participants’ understanding of the context that the individual Parties engage in the further discussions at the meeting.


Is there an application process? If not, which other process is there?
All but one have responded that they have a formal process in place. The rest of the Parties that answered requires some kind of application or notification. Some Parties have a deadline for submitting such application or notification. This deadline varies from six weeks to one year. Some Parties may extend this limit. The Party that has responded and which currently lack national regulations or formal procedures handles requests, require notifications from known expeditions and approves activities or make recommendations to other relevant permitting authorities.

Argentina


Yes. There is an application process for tourist or non governmental ships or aircrafts before the Dirección Nacional del Antártico (DNA), concerning compliance with the provisions of the Madrid Protocol. Also, the competent maritime and aeronautical authorities oversee compliance with IMO/ICAO.

Australia
To meet the requirements under Annex I, Australia’s domestic legislation requires that an Australian citizen or organisation (including tour operators and private expedition organisers) proposing an activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area, must submit an Environmental Approvals Application Form to the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) as the competent authority, prior to the activity taking place. This form incorporates an environmental impact assessment (EIA).

For tourism operators, applications are requested a minimum of two months prior to departure for Antarctica, although later applications can be considered.

The same process is used to apply for permits under Annex V, with additional information requested from proponents as appropriate. 


Canada
Canada implements its environmental protection obligations under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection through the Antarctic Environmental Protection Act (2003) and the associated Antarctic Environmental Protection Regulations. The Department of the Environment (Environment Canada) is responsible for administration and enforcement of the AEPA and acts as Canada’s competent authority.

The procedure for applying for a permit is set out in the Antarctic Environmental Protection Regulations.  The information requirements are stipulated in the regulations.  The regulations stipulate that a permit must be issued within 90 days of receipt of the application.  The guidance to applicants states that the application must be received at least 90 days prior to departure for Antarctica, but the competent authority works with applicants to ensure that they submit their applications sooner  in order to allow for permit issuance well before their actual departure date.

France

The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (Terres Australes et Antarctiques Françaises – TAAF) acts as national competent authority in France.

According to national regulations, a prior notification is required. The notification must be given at last five months before the beginning of the activity in Antarctica. The TAAF may grant exemptions from this deadline.

Pursuant to national regulations, tourism activities are evaluated as having a “minor or transitory impact” on the environment. As such, they have to be submitted under the “permit process” comprising an EIA, and not under the simple “declaration process” (which is reserved for activities having less than a minor or transitory impact).

Germany



According to the German Act implementing the Protocol of Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (AIEP), an application for permit is required. 

The Federal Environment Agency (UBA), as the competent authority, provides questionnaires for different types of activities (e. g. cruises, yacht trips, individual touristic activities) on its homepage. Applicants are encouraged to use these questionnaires in order to submit an application. That should be done as soon as possible, and no later than six weeks before the planned activity. 

Japan
According to law relating to protection of the environment in Antarctica, an application for Certification of an Antarctic Activity Plan shall be submitted to the Minister of the Environment by any person who will supervise the Antarctic Activities contained in the Antarctic Activity Plan.

Netherlands
The Dutch Law (Protection of Antarctica Act) requires any person (individual or company; regardless the nationality) who organises an activity from the Netherlands to Antarctica to apply for a permit and to meet the other requirements of the Dutch legislation that implements the Madrid Protocol and additional Measures (Art. 8). The specific permit requirements of Annex II and V to the Protocol have been integrated into this general permit for Antarctic activities (Art. 6, 8 and 9).

A permit is not needed if the person can demonstrate that the activity has received an authorisation of another Contracting Party to the Protocol. In that situation the person will not be considered as ‘organiser’.

In addition to this permit requirement, more specific obligations and prohibitions (e.g., the duty of care obligation of Art. 3, the mining prohibition and the specific prohibitions of the Annexes to the Protocol) apply to all Dutch citizens participating in activities in Antarctica, irrespective of the country from where the activities are organized.

The Dutch government has drafted a policy framework for the Polar Regions, which contains also further guidance for the implementation of the domestic Antarctic legislation. For instance, it states that no motorized transport is allowed; no permanent buildings will be constructed; no persons are permitted to enter ASPA’s unless such activities are necessary for scientific purposes.

New Zealand
An advance notification outlining the proposed activity must be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) as early as possible, but no later than the end of September prior to the austral summer season during which the activity will take place.

Following advance notification, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must be submitted to MFAT detailing the proposed activity no later than three months before the activity will take place.

Information on the application process is available on MFAT’s website:
http://mfat.govt.nz/Foreign-Relations/Antarctica/index.php 

Norway
According to national regulations, a notification is required. The notification must be given as early as possible, and no later than one year ahead of the planned visit to Antarctica. The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI), the national competent authority on Regulations relating to safety and protection of the environment in Antarctica, may grant exemptions from this deadline.

South Africa
Currently no national regulations or formal permitting procedures are in place. We do however handle requests etc. as if we did have legislation in place. We require those known expeditions to provide notification of planned visits to Antarctica as soon as possible. We then approve or make recommendations to other relevant permitting authorities.

Spain
Yes, any activity to be developed in Antarctica requires notification to the Spanish Polar Committee (CPE)

United Kingdom
The UK Antarctic Acts 1994 and 2013, and associated Antarctic Regulations, implement the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection (including its Annexes I-VI) into UK law.  This legislation establishes a permitting regime for British activities in Antarctica and eligible visitors are required to obtain the necessary permits in advance from the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The competent authority for the UK is therefore the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

Separate permits are required under the Antarctic Act 1994 for:
    • British expeditions to Antarctica (section 3)
    • A person remaining in Antarctica on a British station (section 4)
    • British registered vessels and aircraft entering Antarctica (section 5)
    • Mineral resource activities (for the purposes of scientific research) (section 6) 
    • The taking of, or harmful interference with fauna or flora (section 7)
    • The introduction of non-native animals and plants into Antarctica (section 8)
    • Entry into areas protected under the Protocol (section 9). 

The Antarctic Act also enables the UK to implement, through the permitting regime, other relevant ATCM Measures and Resolutions as appropriate: notably Measures 4(2004) and 15(2009) and Resolutions 4(2004), 4(2007), 5(2007) and 7(2009).


United States
The U.S. regulations specify procedures that need to be followed, prior to an operator organizing a nongovernmental expedition to or within Antarctica, for evaluating the potential impacts of their activities.
If so, what is asked and what documents are requested from the applicant?
Some Parties have a form or template the applicant must use, others not. All Parties mention that they require details on the proponent and the activity and documentation according to the requirements in the Environmental Protocol. One Party mentions that applicants who are not already known to the permitting authority normally will be required to visit to present their proposed activities and to discuss plans, itineraries, EIA, risk assessment and contingency plans. Some Parties indicated that they require documentation of insurance policies and of certificates for vessels and aircrafts.

Argentina




Notification of the activity and a detailed description are required: location, term and schedule, objective, affected area, ground transportation, number of people, waste generation, responsible. The competent authority (DNA) preliminarily assesses the environmental impact of the activity. If necessary, the proponent must submit an EIA in the format indicated by DNA, after which the DNA audits its content and requests additional information or amendments to the activity or to the document, as necessary, until the activity and the document meet the requirements to proceed.

Australia
The Environmental Approvals Application Form requires details of the proponent and the proposed activity. Information is also required on the possible environmental impacts of the proposed activity and planned mitigation measures. 

A copy of the Environmental Approvals Application Form is available at: http://www.antarctica.gov.au/environment/environmental-impact-assessment-approvals-and-permits/environmental-impact-assessment 
 
Consistent with Recommendation XVIII-1 (1994), Australia requests tourism operators to provide advance notification, including details of insurance cover and safety provisions.

Canada
There is an application form appended to the regulations that must be used. Permit applications must include an environmental impact assessment, a waste management plan, and an emergency plan. The emergency plan must provide a comprehensive plan for emergency response, evacuation, and environmental mitigation. 

In addition, certificates must be provided for vessels and aircraft to be used on expeditions in order to ensure that they meet minimum requirements for travel in Antarctic conditions and that they are in compliance with all relevant environmental and safety codes.

France

The notification must include information about who is responsible for the activity, the crew, passengers, the ship, a description of the activity, the visited sites, action plan in case of an emergency, an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the activity (ASPA, ASMA, HSM, protection of fauna and flora, management of waste, self-evaluation of impacts), a plan for how to limit negative impact, and information about contingency plans and search-and-rescue insurance. 
If a contingency plan requires support from others, the agreement for support must be documented. Insurances must also be documented. 

Germany
With the questionnaires UBA asks for information on the applicant and fellow passengers, details on the ship, mode of travel, area of activity, activities within the journey, logistical equipment, safety and insurances aspects, disposal of wastes and sewages and an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the activity including cumulative effects and mitigation measures. 

The applicants have to submit different documents attached to their application, e. g. copies of insurance policies, certificates according to regulations of MARPOL, map of travel area, application for entering an ASPA.

Japan
 An application should describe the following matters:

    • the name or title and address of the Supervisor and, in case of a juridical person, the name of its representative and directors;
    • the purpose of the Antarctic Activity Plan;
    • the number of persons who will engage in the Antarctic Activities contained in the Antarctic Activity Plan;
    • the purposes, timing, place and implementation methods of the Antarctic Activities; and
    • the details of the acts that constitute the Antarctic Activities contained in the Antarctic Activity plan and the name of the persons who will perform those acts, if already determined.

Netherlands
The applicant is required to send in an application form describing the activities, objectives, details of ship/travel/accommodation, planned trip, crew list, expected potential negative effects, preventive and contingency measures and insurance.

In support of the application form, the applicant is obliged to submit maps of the proposed trip and explanation of locations to be visited. Additionally, applicants can be asked to supply a contingency plan, an IEE, research proposal or other supporting documents. For companies an extract of Chamber of Commerce must be provided as well. 

New Zealand
The EIA application should describe the activity, identify impacts of the activity on the environment (direct, indirect and cumulative), identify mitigation of impacts, identify alternatives to the activity, provide an assessment of the effect on the Antarctic environment (less than, no more than or greater than minor or transitory).

A template is available for the preliminary environmental evaluation stage for those activities being supported by the New Zealand national programme (Antarctica New Zealand).

MFAT requires evidence of operators’ insurance, health and safety and search and rescue contingency plans (Measure 4 (2004)) for privately organised activities.

Norway
The notification must include information about who is responsible for the activity, its objectives, participants, details on transport, accommodation and planned activities, schedule and itinerary, equipment, the experience of the participants, an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the activity, waste management plan, a plan for how to limit negative impact, and information about contingency plans and search-and-rescue insurance. 

If a contingency plan requires support from others, the agreement for support must be documented. Insurances must also be documented. Both may be documented later, cf. «conditions». 

South Africa
The notification must include information about who is responsible for the activity, its objectives, etc., an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the activity, a plan for how to limit negative impact, and information about contingency plans and search-and-rescue insurance. 

If a contingency plan requires support from others, the agreement for support must be documented. Insurance cover must also be documented. Copies of all relevant documents must be provided.

Physical inspections where feasible of vessels, facilities etc. also follow. 

Spain
Yes, in practice there are different application forms depending on the type of activity, in general include: information about the responsible of the activity, objectives, type of expedition, an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the activity, information about contingency plans and search, rescue and medical insurances. 

All insurances must be documented

United Kingdom
Prospective travellers to Antarctica can download application forms from www.gov.uk/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit.  The main application form (covering entry into Antarctica) requires full information about the proposed itinerary of any visit to Antarctica, including full details of the proposed location; duration; names of all participants (together with their Antarctic experience, as relevant); and all activities they wish to undertake while in Antarctica.  

All applicants must complete a preliminary environmental impact questionnaire (PEIQ), unless the level of required environmental impact assessment has already been agreed.  The PEIQ is then used to assess whether a subsequent IEE or CEE is required.

Applicants are also asked to complete a detailed risk assessment covering all proposed activities, and append all relevant documentation to their application form.  This includes:  

    a. insurance documentation - covering all expedition members and explicitly mentioning Antarctica; and  
    b. contractual agreements relating to contingency plans and any arrangements for search and rescue and medical evacuation.  

Where an applicant is not already known to the permitting authority, they will normally be required to visit the FCO to present their proposed activities and to allow for a full discussion of plans, itineraries, environmental impact assessments, risk assessments and contingency plans.

The competent authority assessment process particularly focuses on:

    a. previous experience of the applicant – in terms of planned location in Antarctica and activities proposed;
    b. the relevant experience and/or training team of the expedition organisers and members;
    c. whether the environmental impact assessment is thorough and credible.  If a proposed activity may have more than a minor or transitory impact, an IEE or CEE is commissioned;
    d. whether the contingency planning covers all potential scenarios which the expedition may face in Antarctica – and in particular, whether plans are in place to remove all waste and equipment from Antarctica after the completion of the expedition;
    e. whether the risk assessment indicates that the applicant has adequately considered all perceived risks and how they would mitigate each of them;
    f. whether there is a clear communications plan in place, with a formalised reporting schedule and contingencies for loss of contact, equipment loss or failure etc covering the entire duration that the expedition is south of 60⁰ South;
    g. whether any part of the activities are subject to authorisation by another Treaty Party, or where there are any implications for other Parties (in terms of the involvement of their nationals, or where activities are proposed to take place in the vicinity of Antarctic stations etc); and
    h. whether there is a reasonable justification for the activities to take place in Antarctica and a credible education angle (in line with Resolution 7(2009).

United States
U.S. regulations ensure that nongovernmental operators identify and assess the potential impacts of their proposed activities on the Antarctic environment and that operators consider these impacts in deciding whether or how to proceed with proposed activities.  This specific information is required for one of the three levels of EIA documentation (i.e preliminary environmental review, initial environmental evaluation (IEE) and comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE)) in addition to the basic information that is similar in content to an Advanced Notification. 

There are no specific models or forms required for this documentation process.  

Are permits given? If not, is any approval or other response given?
Four of the responding Parties issue permits. The others give an approval, certification or recommendation. Some of the latter Parties note that permits are issued if the applicant wishes to enter an ASPA. One of the responding Parties that issues permits and four of the Parties that do not note that they may request further documentation or require that an activity must be changed or postponed, or that they may forbid an activity if it is not in accordance with the regulations. One Party has a process that includes public participation. 
Argentina

The DNA indicates whether the activity can proceed or not, whilst there is compliance with the provisions of international and national regulations.

Australia
The AAD approves an activity by providing the proponent with an Environmental Authorisation.

In accordance with Annex V, an activity may also be granted a Permit if the activity requires entry to an ASPA, subject to the proposed activity being consistent with the management plan or other applicable requirements. 

Canada
Permits are issued if the Minister finds that the proposed activities will have less than a minor or transitory impact and if all other conditions in the Act and regulations are fulfilled.

France

TAAF approves the activity if it is found to be in accordance with the regulations and the Environmental Protocol. TAAF may also demand further information or documentation; or order that an activity must be changed or postponed; or may prohibit an activity if it is not in accordance with the regulations. The instruction process takes into account environmental as well as security criterions. 

Pursuant to national regulations, every notification is transmitted for examination and advice to the French Committee for Polar Environment.

If TAAF does not decide otherwise and provide a statement about the refusal to the proponent, the activity may be carried out in accordance with what is stated in the permit issued by TAAF. 

Germany
UBA issues permits for all activities organised in Germany or proceed from its territory.
 

Japan
The Minister of the Environment shall, if he/she determines that all the Antarctic Activities contained in the Antarctic Activity Plan related to an Application satisfy the requirements determined in Madrid Protocol, issue Certification.

If the Minister of the Environment, having received an application, determines it necessary to examine whether the application meets the requirements, he/she may issue an order in writing to the applicant requesting that the applicant take some or all of the following measures within a reasonable period of time (the reasons for issuing the order and the time allotted for meeting its requirement shall be stipulated in the order):

    • amend the application; 
    • submit IEE; and
    • revise or supplement IEE;.

Japanese law does not use the term “permit” but “certification”, because in our legal framework permit means exception of illegal action and tourism in the Antarctic Treaty Area is secured by the Antarctic Treaty.

Netherlands
There is a permit requirement - see the first column. The Dutch Competent Authorities (DCA) will evaluate the application for a permit and critically assess whether the proposed activity is in accordance with the Protection of Antarctica Act, additional legislation under this act and/or Dutch policy regarding Antarctica. DCA may require additional information and will prohibit or postpone an activity if it is not in accordance with the regulations.

As the decision regarding a permit application is concerned, there are three options:
    • A permit is granted under conditions;
    • A permit is refused because the application does not meet the requirements of the legislation or because 
    • A permit is granted under conditions, but certain activities are refused.

Public participation is ensured as follows: 
A draft permit is published and the public has 6 weeks for inspection and submission of objections.

If after this review, the competent authority decides to issue a permit, the decision is available for public inspection for another 6 weeks. During this period the decision may also be challenges in an administrative court.  The Procedure takes no more than 6 months, except for complicated dossiers. 
 
New Zealand
If the Minister of Foreign Affairs determines that the activity is consistent with the environmental principles set out in Article 3 of the Protocol a notification of approval is issued stating the activity may proceed.

The Minister may ask for further documentation, may direct the operator to modify, suspend or cancel the activity, or may prohibit an activity if it is not in accordance with the Protocol. 

Permits may be issued as part of the notification of approval if the applicant wishes to enter or carry out any activity in an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA), take or harmfully interfere with native flora and fauna or introduce non-native species to Antarctica. Conditions may be attached to any permit.


Norway
NPI approves the activity if it is found to be in accordance with the regulations. NPI may also request further information or documentation; or require that an activity must be changed or postponed; or may prohibit an activity if it is not in accordance with the regulations.

If NPI does not decide otherwise and provide a statement about this to the proponent within two months of proposed start date, the activity may be carried out in accordance with what is stated in the notification. 

Permits may be issued as part of the notification of approval if the applicant wishes to enter or carry out any activity in an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA), take or harmfully interfere with native flora and fauna or introduce non-native species to Antarctica. Conditions may be attached to any permit.

South Africa
No permits are given. Approval / recommendation of the activity, if it is found to be in accordance with the ATS guidelines etc. are provided. 

Each activity has to provide an IEE which has to be authorised by our Environmental Impact Authorisations Office.

Spain
The CPE approves the activity if it is in accordance with the Measures and Resolutions of the Antarctic Treaty.
The CPE also may deny an activity.

United Kingdom
Permits are given based on the following criteria: 

    a. previous experience of the applicant – in terms of planned location in Antarctica and activities proposed;
    b. the relevant experience and/or training team of the expedition organisers and members;
    c. whether the environmental impact assessment is thorough and credible.  If a proposed activity may have more than a minor or transitory impact, an IEE or CEE is commissioned;
    d. whether the contingency planning covers all potential scenarios which the expedition may face in Antarctica – and in particular, whether plans are in place to remove all waste and equipment from Antarctica after the completion of the expedition;
    e. whether the risk assessment indicates that the applicant has adequately considered all perceived risks and how they would mitigate each of them;
    f. whether there is a clear communications plan in place, with a formalised reporting schedule and contingencies for loss of contact, equipment loss or failure etc covering the entire duration that the expedition is south of 60⁰ South;
    g. whether any part of the activities are subject to authorisation by another Treaty Party, or where there are any implications for other Parties (in terms of the involvement of their nationals, or where activities are proposed to take place in the vicinity of Antarctic stations etc); and
    h. whether there is a reasonable justification for the activities to take place in Antarctica and a credible education angle (in line with Resolution 7(2009)).

United States
No permits are issued.  However, based on the U.S.’s review, operators are notified whether their environmental documentation meets the requirements of Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol and the provisions of the U.S. EIA regulations.


How comprehensive are those permits/approvals/responses?
Three of the responding Parties answers that they refer all or most of the details from the notification/application in their response. The rest gives a summary. The responses may also contain conditions, and they may include the main regulations applying to the activity. 
Argentina

The approval granted by the DNA is related to compliance and conformity with the Madrid Protocol and the environmental provisions.

Australia
As part of the EIA process, the proponent submits a comprehensive outline of the proposed activity including details of all potential environmental impacts. This information is referred to in the authorisation and permit (if one is required). The activity must be conducted in accordance with what was proposed in the Environmental Approvals Application Form.

Additional conditions may be placed on the authorisation or permit to provide further environmental protections.

The level of detail in authorisations and permits can vary depending on the complexity of the activity.

Canada
Permits contain full details on the entity authorized to conduct activities, the vessel or aircraft involved, and the itinerary for the activities.  For vessel based tourism, multiple voyages are listed on a single permit for the Antarctic season.

France

The permit summarizes the information in the notification and specifies the activity that is permitted (who, where, when, what activity). 

It states the advice noticed by the French Committee for Polar Environment as well as the obligations from the TAAF.

It recalls the obligation to provide the TAAF with a Post-visit report. The approvals are normally two pages long for yachts, and 11 pages for cruise ships.

Germany
The permit names the activity that is permitted (who, where, when, what activity) and summarises the information in the application and the application process shortly.

If the activity has minor or transitory impacts on the environmental assets to be protected the result of the Initial Environmental Evaluation is to be included in the permit.

It also includes the main regulations of the AIEP and the international regulations that apply to touristic and non-governmental activities in Antarctica. The compliance of the latter is imposed through provisos.


Japan
Certification shows that the persons performing the Antarctic Activities under his/her supervision are engaged in Antarctic Activity Plan that has been duly certificated.

The certification also shows;

    • The Date of certification;
    • Name of the juridical person and the name of its representative;
    • Purpose;
    • Timing;
    • Place;
    • Implementation method;
    • Conditions;
    • Issues related to permit  under Article 4, AnnexⅡ to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;
    • Issues related to permit under Article 3, Annex Ⅱ to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty; and
    • Issues related to permit under Article 7, Annex Ⅴ to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;.
    • Others

Netherlands
The permit summarizes the activities and the conditions under which the activities are permitted during a specified time period.

The permit usually is about 27 pages long and consists of:
    • Introduction
    • The decision made by the Authorities
    • The conditions under which the permit is granted
    • The  application itself
    • A review of the application with the objectives of the Protection of Antarctica Act 
    • Procedure
    • Conclusion, and 
    • Communications. 

The permit is signed by a representative of both the Dutch Minister of Economic affairs (also responsible for nature protection), and the Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment.

New Zealand
The notification/permit is comprehensive and the Minister has a wide discretion to include specific Ministerial Directions to restrict the activity. 

The notification/permit is normally three to four pages long.


Norway
The approval summarizes the information in the notification and specifies the activity that has been considered (who, where, when, what activity). It also re-states the main regulations that apply to visits in Antarctica and specifies conditions. The approvals are normally three to four pages long. In addition, the competent authority issues a brief confirmation in English, which states that the activity has has been approved in accordance with the national regulations and has been granted the necessary approval to undertake the activity as notified. 

South Africa
The approval / recommendation summarizes the information in the notification and specifies the activity that is permitted (who, where, when, what activity). 

Additional information on Site Visit Guidelines, Station Contact details etc. are also provided.

If feasible it also includes a personal briefing / instruction session.

Spain
The permit issued summarizes the activity approved including who, where, when and what activity. The regulations of Antarctic Treaty about tourism and non-governmental activities are included.

United Kingdom
The permit application, including all of the above mentioned (see under heading “If so, what is asked and what documents are requested from the applicant?”)  information and as amended (if appropriate) during the competent authorities consideration process, is appended to the permit in full.  Deviation from this application is an offence under the Antarctic Act.

In addition, permits may contain any specific conditions as the competent authority deems appropriate.  These are normally used to reinforce specific provisions previously agreed with the applicant.  There are standard permitting conditions for many specific activities, such as the use of helicopters, vehicles or drones, or for specific ‘adventure activities’ like diving and snow-boarding.    Standard conditions clearly set out that the permit holder has legal responsibility for any equipment and its responsible use.  

Any breach of the conditions set out in the permit may lead to suspension or revocation of the permit in accordance with the provisions of the Antarctic Regulations 1995/490 and is punishable as an offence under section 5(4) or section 13(2) of the Antarctic Act 1994, for which the maximum penalty is two years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both

United States
The U.S. regulations provide for three levels of EIA documentation: preliminary environmental review, initial environmental evaluation (IEE) and comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE).  

The environmental review process is intended to ensure that the EIA identifies the activities, assess the potential impacts, and includes mitigation measures that will ensure any potential impacts are consistent with the level of documentation.  


Is the permit/approval/response subject to provisos and conditions?
With one exception, all responding Parties answer that their permit/approval/response is subject to provisos and conditions. Among the conditions mentioned are submission of documentation of insurances and certificates for ships, reporting requirements, and specific conditions according to the activity. A few Parties have standard conditions, or standard conditions for specific activities. Provisos may for example be compliance with Site guidelines and Measures and Resolutions concerning tourism. Several Parties mention that failure to submit documentation or apply to other conditions means the permission/approval will be inactive. 
Argentina

Yes. The activity can proceed as long as the proponent respects the terms of the EIA. It must also comply with any other condition indicated by the DNA.

Australia
All authorisations and permits have standard compliance and reporting conditions that relate to post activity reporting.

In addition, activity-specific conditions may be included in permits or authorisations to provide enhanced environmental protection.

Canada
A standard set of conditions is included in most permits which include obligations under the AEPA and Madrid Protocol, emergency contact procedures, and reporting requirements.  In addition, application reviewers may request inclusion of special precautions in the permit conditions.  Finally, special conditions may be added for particular activities that occur as parts of tours and for activities undertaken as part of adventure expeditions.

France

The approval may be subject to provisions/conditions from TAAF and from the French Committee for Polar Environment .

Normal conditions are submission of documentation of civil liability insurance, a photography of the vessel, a map of the itinerary, copies of emergency action plans, copies of diplomas concerning sailing and medical abilities, and copy of the expertise report of the vessel (if existing).

For the 2015-2016 season, and in application of Measure 4(2004), the TAAF will ask for insurance covering the costs related to SAR operations, medical care, medical evacuation, and repatriation to the country of origin.

Germany
The permit can be issued subject to conditions and provisos. 

Provisos are compliance of Site Guidelines, Measures and Resolutions concerning tourism. Possible conditions are the submission of insurance policies or certificates according to regulations of MARPOL. These have to be submitted prior to the activity. 

Japan
Yes, the Minister of the Environment may attach conditions to Certification, to the extent he/she determines such conditions are necessary for the protection of the Antarctic Environment.

Netherlands
The approval is subject to provisions and conditions. If these are not met, or in case certain documents have not been submitted before departure; the permit will be inactive.
 
New Zealand
The notification/permit may be subject to Ministerial Directions, permit conditions and other notes in this section.

MFAT requires a full post-visit report including any environmental impacts observed, details of any activities in breach of the notification/permit and non-compliance with the IEE, details of landing sites, and any other relevant details by 1 June following the activity each year.

Norway
The approval may be subject to provisos/conditions. Normal conditions are submission of documentation of insurance and agreement for SAR support. Both must be submitted four weeks prior to the activity. 
 
South Africa
The approval / recommendation may be subject to certain conditions. 

Spain
The permits issued can include conditions according the type of activity

United Kingdom
The permit application, including all of the above mentioned information and as amended (if appropriate) during the competent authorities consideration process, is appended to the permit in full.  Deviation from this application is an offence under the Antarctic Act.

In addition, permits may contain any specific conditions as the competent authority deems appropriate.  These are normally used to reinforce specific provisions previously agreed with the applicant.  There are standard permitting conditions for many specific activities, such as the use of helicopters, vehicles or drones, or for specific ‘adventure activities’ like diving and snow-boarding.    Standard conditions clearly set out that the permit holder has legal responsibility for any equipment and its responsible use.  

Any breach of the conditions set out in the permit may lead to suspension or revocation of the permit in accordance with the provisions of the Antarctic Regulations 1995/490 and is punishable as an offence under section 5(4) or section 13(2) of the Antarctic Act 1994, for which the maximum penalty is two years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both

United States
While the U.S. process does not result in specific provisions or conditions; the EIA review process includes operator proposed mitigation to reduce the environmental impacts of its activity and support the level of environmental documentation required to meet Article 8 and Annex I and the provisions of US regulations.

Does your national legislation give any guidance with respect to regulation of activities where participants or interests from more than one country are involved?
Most of the responding Parties notes that their regulations apply to their own nationals, legal persons, ships and vessels registered in their country, foreigners residing there and to foreigners participating in or being responsible for activities organised from their own country or proceeding directly from their own country to Antarctica. However, these regulations do not apply to persons taking part in an activity approved by another State that has corresponding provisions and is party o the Environmental Protocol. Three Parties has another approach. Their regulations applies to nationals of any country where the activity is organised from their country or their country is the final point of departure for Antarctica, but not if the activity already has a permit from another Party.  Some Parties mention that when more than one country is involved, they contact the competent authority of the Party/Parties involved.
Argentina



When there are aspects of an activity, that involve other Parties (private or governmental), the DNA contacts the authorities of the Parties involved and agrees on or coordinates the steps to follow in terms of authorization. Argentina believes that such cases must be solved based on the principle of international cooperation, which is at the core of the Antarctic Treaty System.


Australia
Australia’s domestic legislation applies to Australian citizens, Australian expeditions, Australian organisations and Australian property. The proponent is responsible for the activity as authorised, including where this covers the involvement of nationals of other countries.

Activities which have already received approval from another Competent Authority are exempted.

Where a proposed activity involves both Australian and non-Australian proponents, the AAD consults with other competent authorities to ensure all aspects of the activity are appropriately considered and duly authorised and permitted. 

Canada
In order to enter the Antarctic, the Act requires any member of a Canadian expedition, a Canadian vessel, or a Canadian aircraft to obtain a permit under the AEPA or to have a permit or authorization from another Protocol party.  Anyone entering a Canadian station would require an AEPA permit.  As Canada does not currently have a station, most Canadian research is occurring at the bases of other Treaty parties.  Generally advice on the need for a permit where more than one country is involved is given on a case-by-case basis.  

France

The French Law and regulations apply to French nationals, French legal persons, French ships and aircrafts.

The Regulations also apply to foreigners who participate in or are responsible for activity in Antarctica which is organised from France or from a French territory.

The Law and regulations do not apply to persons taking part of an activity approved by another State which has corresponding provisions and is party to the Environment Protocol. 

Germany
The Regulations of the AIEP apply to German nationals, other natural persons domiciled or habitually resident in Germany, legal persons or unincorporated associations resident in the territory of Germany and foreign legal persons or unincorporated associations. These persons or institutions have to carry out an activity organised in Germany or proceed directly from its territory.

A permit is not required for activities which have been authorised by another Party to the Protocol of Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 

Japan
Japanese domestic law shall apply to Japanese nationals, juridical persons of Japan, foreigners residing in Japan, and foreign juridical persons having offices in Japan whose employees engage in Antarctic Activities or are involved in the supervision of Antarctic Activities in connection with the business of the said juridical persons.

Submission of application for certification is exempted if such activity have received permission or other administrative treatment similar to the certification stipulated in the Japanese Law and are pursuant to the provision of any law or regulation of a foreign country that is a Party to the Protocol that is comparable to Japanese Act or which have been exempted from the said treatment by the provisions of Related Act or Regulation of a foreign Party.


Netherlands
The Dutch permit requirement applies to all persons who organises an activity from the Netherlands to Antarctica, so including foreigners and foreign companies. However, a person who can demonstrate that the activity has received an authorisation of another Contracting Party to the Protocol will not be considered as an ‘organiser’ under the Dutch act (Art. 1 and explanatory memorandum). For this exemption it is necessary that the specific activity/acts are explicitly covered by the authorisation of the other Contr.Party.

In addition to this permit requirement, more specific obligations and prohibitions (e.g., the duty of care obligation (Art. 3), the mining prohibition and the specific prohibitions of the Annexes to the Protocol (implemented through Art. 6 of the act) apply to all Dutch citizens participating in activities in Antarctica, irrespective of the country from where the activities have been organized. 

Consequently, these provisions also apply to Dutch citizens who participate in a ‘foreign expedition’ (e.g. the duty of care obligation and the mining prohibition), however, for some prohibitions (e.g., entering ASPAs) an exemption applies in case of an explicit authorization for that specific act by another Contracting Party (Art. 6(3)). 

New Zealand
New Zealand legislation applies inter alia to nationals of any country where the activity is organised in New Zealand or proceeds from New Zealand as its final point of departure for Antarctica.

New Zealand legislation allows for recognition of permitting by other Contracting Parties.  This requires an exemption granted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

Norway

The Regulations also apply to foreigners who participate in or are responsible for activity in Antarctica which is organised from Norway or proceeds directly from Norway to Antarctica.
