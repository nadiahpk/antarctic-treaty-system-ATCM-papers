French measures to increase the security of tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic

France’s competent national authority, the French Southern and Antarctic Territories, receives requests each year for the authorization of tourism and non-governmental activities that pose particularly high risks to human life, such as sports challenges.

Measure 4 (2004) recommends that Antarctic Treaty Parties require those organizing or conducting tourism or non-governmental activities in the Antarctic to provide proof that appropriate contingency plans and sufficient arrangements for health and safety, search and rescue, and medical care and evacuation are in place, as well as adequate insurance to cover any costs associated with search and rescue and medical care and evacuation. France approved Measure 4 (2004) on 22 August 2008 and reiterated its wish to see this important Measure adopted in document WPO48, Entry into force of Measure 4 (2004) in 2014. Resolution 7 (2014) recommends that Antarctic Treaty Parties that have approved Measure 4 (2004) consider taking steps at national level while waiting for it to enter into force.

Resolution 6 (2014) recommends that Antarctic Treaty Parties encourage those organizing or conducting tourist or non-governmental activities in the Antarctic to use a risk-based assessment process as a planning tool and that they take into account this risk-based assessment developed by operators as part of the authorization process. 

In compliance with the aforementioned texts and in view of the rising number of requests regarding activities that involve a high level of risk to human life, the French Southern and Antarctic Territories adopted an order on 12 February 2015 establishing that expedition leaders shall assess the risks of the planned activity and the competent national authority shall take security into account as part of the authorization process. 

This order requires expedition leaders to possess insurance covering the costs relating to search and rescue operations, medical care and evacuation, and repatriation of persons to their country of origin. It stipulates that expedition leaders must give proof of their skills and of those of their team by providing diplomas or certificates of sailing and medical knowledge and must provide detailed information about each activity that poses a risk to the health and safety of the people involved. 

Lastly, expedition leaders are required to report any serious incidents immediately and note any incidents affecting the security of persons or property in their post-visit report. 

The full text of this new French order is annexed to this document. France welcomes the adoption of this text, which implements the recommendations of the Treaty with regard to security, and appeals once again to the Parties to enable the rapid entry into force of Measure 4 (2004).
