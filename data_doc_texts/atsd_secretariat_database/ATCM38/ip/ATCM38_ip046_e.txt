Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment: a review
An Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Spain and Chile
Summary
Since 2010, the United Kingdom has led the submission of annual reports on the colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.  This information paper summaries a recent academic review paper that details non-native species distribution and eradications within the Treaty area and discussed pertinent legislative and management issues.
Background
Non-native species invasions present one of the greatest threats to Antarctic biodiversity and the issue has been identified as a Priority 1 topic in the CEP five-year work plan (for further details see Newman et al., 2014). 

Since 2010, the United Kingdom has led the submission of annual reports to the CEP on the colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment to help CEP Members in their understanding of the scale and extent of non-native species introductions in light of the available information (ATCM XXXVII IP23; ATCM XXXVI IP28; ATCM XXXV IP29; ATCM XXXIV IP50 and ATCM XXXIII IP42).  

This Information Paper summarises a recent research paper (authored by UK, Spanish and Chilean scientists) that reviewed the status of non-native introductions and eradications within the Treaty area and discussed relevant legislative and management issues (Hughes et al., 2015; available at Attachments A to this Information Paper, or at: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-015-0896-6/fulltext.html).  The research paper attempted to bring up-to-date several lists of non-native species published in the mid-2000s, which focused largely on the sub-Antarctic islands, given the dearth of literature available at that time from the continental and maritime Antarctic regions. 

A table showing the terrestrial non-native species currently known from within the Antarctic Treaty area (as provided in earlier years) is provided at Attachment B.
Non-native species colonisation status and distribution
    • Reports of non-native species introductions within the Treaty area have increased rapidly in the past decade.  A lack of widespread monitoring activity means other non-native species may have established, but have not been reported.
    • Most, if not all, known non-native species within the Treaty area are found within Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Region (ACBR) No. 2 South Orkney Islands and ACBR No. 3 Northwest Antarctic Peninsula.
    • Established non-native species populations are found at 12 locations, which are all within, or close to, research stations or visitor sites, and correspond largely with areas predicted to be under threat by a continent-wide risk assessment.
    • Deception Island is by far the most invaded location with nine non-native species, followed by Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, South Shetland Islands) and Neko Harbour (Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula) with four each.  
    • The grass Poa annua is the only remaining non-native plant known from within the Treaty area.  It has spread from its original introduction site near a research station to become established within ASPA 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands.  
    • Invertebrates comprise the great majority of known non-native species in Antarctica.
    • A growing number of sewage treatment plants have become infested with non-native flies.
Eradication and removal of non-native species
    • No non-native invertebrates, established in the natural environment, have yet been subject to any eradication attempt within the Treaty area, despite a recent increase in reports. 
    • Recent research showed that Poa annua has expanded its distribution around Admiralty Bay and that the non-native grass can have negative effects on indigenous plant species.  Some scientists consider Poa annua to have become invasive in Antarctica and that it should be an urgent priority for eradication action in accordance with Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
    • With the exception of Poa annua around Admiralty Bay, all non-native plants have either died out naturally or been removed/eradicated from introduction sites. However, seed banks from earlier plant introductions may still persist, potentially resulting in plant re-establishment.  
    • The most recent plant removal was the grass Poa pratensis from Cierva Point (Danco Coast, Palmer Archipelago, Antarctic Peninsula) in January 2015 (see ATCM XXXVIII IP29).
Concluding remarks
Reports of non-native species establishment within the Treaty area continue to increase in number.  Better education of Antarctic visitors about non-native species issues and application of consistent and effective biosecurity practices may help reduce non-native species introductions.  However, without co-ordinated monitoring of high activity sites for introduced species, it is not possible:
    1. to ascertain the effectiveness of biosecurity measures in the region, or
    2. remove/eradicate new non-natives species at the earliest opportunity when inherent costs and effort are at a minimum.
