¨From East to West¨ initiative
Uruguay´s contribution to a broader knowledge of Antarctica by sharing own facilities intra regions


At ATCM XXXVII, Uruguay proposed to work towards a more inclusive and cooperative Antarctic Treaty System as an additional priority issue of the Multiyear Strategic Work Plan. Our objective was not only to achieve enhanced cooperation among Parties and the effective participation of all Parties in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, but also to propose and participate in collaborative scientific projects.

The results of surveys of National Antarctic Programs on international scientific and logistic collaboration in Antarctica reveal that a significant and high degree of international cooperation amongst programs is ongoing. A substantial part of this cooperation is based on regional activities performed by operators coordinating national program plans and support for scientific activities. 

The ATCM, with the expert advice of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP), has adopted many measures on scientific cooperation and operational matters such as telecommunications, meteorology, transportation and other subjects of importance to Antarctic research programs.
Within this framework and considering that:
    • there are different scientific and operational conditions in the Eastern and Western areas of Antarctica;  
    • in addition to the exchanges of information and discussions carried out at the ATCM aiming to promote collaboration in science, conducting field operations in all areas will provide further information for decision making; 
    • sharing facilities has been found to be a useful tool for reducing the human footprint on the environment and can contribute to a wider knowledge in science and operational matters of the Antarctic as a whole;
Uruguay has decided to contribute towards these goals by announcing and actively promoting the “From East to West” Initiative. 
This is intended to be done by inviting staff and scientists operating in East Antarctica to the Uruguayan Bases in West Antarctica, at no cost to the invited Party, with transportation offered from South America to the aforementioned facilities using Uruguay’s own transport capabilities. 
Lengths of stay, fields of research, associated logistical support and requirements will be arranged at the National Program level of the Parties involved. 
Uruguay encourages other Parties to join this initiative and offer similar opportunities to visit and conduct scientific research at their own Antarctic facilities.
