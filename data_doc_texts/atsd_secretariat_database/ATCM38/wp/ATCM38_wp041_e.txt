Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 168 Mount Harding, Grove Mountains, East Antarctica 

Working Paper submitted by the People’s Republic of China 
Summary
In accordance with Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, China has undertaken a five-yearly review of the management plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 168 Mount Harding, Grove Mountains, East Antarctica. The review was conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide) appended to Resolution 2 (2011). The following sections briefly describe the Area, and describe the proposed minor amendments to the management plan. China recommends that the CEP approve the attached revised management plan.
Background
The Mount Harding ASPA is located in the core area of the Grove Mountains, East Antarctica at 72°51’ -72°57’ S, 74°53’ -75°12’ E. Mount Harding was originally designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 168 through Measure 2 (2008) after a proposal by China. The primary reason for designation of the Area is to protect the unique geomorphological features of the area for scientific research on the evolutionary history of East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), while the Area is of great aesthetic and wilderness values. These grounds for designation of the Area remain valid. ASPA 168 is designated for an indefinite period. A revised management plan for ASPA No. 168 is attached.
Summary of amendments to the management plan for ASPA No. 168
Minor changes to the existing Management Plan include:
• Introduction: CHINARE visits’ time has been updated.
• Section 1 Description of values to be protected: Description of the human activities has been deleted because this part has been included in Introduction section.
• Section 2 Aims and objectives: Description about alien species introduction has been supplemented, so as to keep this part consistent with the restrictions in 7(vi).
• Section 8 Supporting documentation: The documentation list has been updated.
• Editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the Guide.
Recommendation 
China recommends that the CEP approve the attached revised management plan for ASPA No. 168 Mount Harding, Grove Mountains, East Antarctica.
