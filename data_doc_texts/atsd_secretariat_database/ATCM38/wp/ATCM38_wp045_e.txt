On Payment of Contributions by Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat by Instalments





On Payment of Contributions by Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat by Instalments

Working Paper submitted by Ukraine


Ukraine suggests that each Consultative Party which suffers from a temporary difficult political and economic situation (military aggression, occupation of the territory, acts of God, etc.) should have the possibility to pay contributions to the ATS by instalments, both contributions for the current financial year and payment of arrears for the previous period, if any.

Whereas this issue is not governed by the Financial Regulations for the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty adopted by Decision 4 (2003), Ukraine proposes to adopt a respective draft Decision attached hereto.














Decision X (2015)
Payment of Contributions by Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat by Instalments 

The representatives,
Noting that paragraph 4 of Measure 1 (2003) refers to contributions of the Parties to the budget of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat; and 

Taking into account the Financial Regulations for the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty adopted by Decision 4 (2003); 
Decide:
To insert an additional paragraph 5.6 into Regulation 5 "Provision of Funds" of the Financial Regulations for the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty to read as follows:
"In case of force majeure circumstances (acts of war, acts of God, etc.) that hinder payment of contributions in due time as specified in Regulation 5.5 above, the affected Consultative Party, upon written notification to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, may pay the contributions by instalments, both contributions for the current financial year and payment of arrears for the previous period, if any, until the situation returns to normal conditions whereof the Consultative Party shall additionally inform the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat".
