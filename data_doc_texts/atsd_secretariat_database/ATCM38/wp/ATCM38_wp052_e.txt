Co-chairs’ report of the Workshop on Education, Sofia, Bulgaria, May 2015
Working Paper submitted by Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and UK

Summary
In accordance with ATCMXXXVII WP9, Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and UK jointly hosted a Workshop on Education in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 31 May 2015. Ninety seven participants from 37 Parties, Observers and Experts attended. The Parties are asked to consider the co-chairs’ report of the workshop, including the recommendations arising, and the list of priority issues incorporated in this Working Paper.

Background
At the 37th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXXVII) held in Brasilia in 2014 Parties discussed the organisation of a workshop on education to be held in the context of ATCM XXXVIII   (Paragraph 323, report ATCM XXXVII).  The aims of the workshop, expressed in ATCM XXXVII WP9 (see also paragraphs 323-328 from item 15: Educational issues within ACTM XXXVII final report), would be to enable Treaty Parties, Observers, Invited Experts and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat to:

    1) Learn more about the Education and Outreach projects already being undertaken; 
    2) Examine whether projects might be linked to maximize the return on resources and the overall impact; and 
    3) Consider how to secure support for a Communication, Engagement and Education Forum as a lasting legacy of the International Polar Year, bringing science and education communicators from the Treaty parties, COMNAP, SCAR and NGOs (e.g. APECS, PEI) to meet together, before ATCMs, to exchange ideas on how to take forward the ATCM’s desire for improved education and outreach.

Parties also suggested that such a workshop would be a good place to discuss educational activities related to the 25th anniversary of the Madrid Protocol (see XXXVIII WP 44 and WP 47).
The report of the workshop is in ATCM XXXVIII BP26.

The Workshop on education was held in the National Palace of Culture, Sofia, Bulgaria, on the 31 May 2015. It was co-chaired by Dragomir Mateev (Bulgaria), Annick Wilmotte (Belgium), Maria Rita Fontes (Brazil), Elías Barticevic (Chile), José Xavier (Portugal) and Linda Capper (UK), and involved representatives from Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, Non-Consultative parties, observers and other ATCM participants (see Appendix 1). 

Conduct of the workshop
Parties were requested to give their presentations on their Antarctic educational activities from an Antarctic Treaty perspective. A total of 26 oral presentations, and 19 poster presentations, were given by individual Parties.

A general discussion gave the opportunity to comment on the presentations and examine potential collaborations in the future in terms of education. The remaining time was dedicated to discussion of education and outreach activities related to the 25th Anniversary of the Madrid Protocol.


Outcomes 
Participants agreed on the following priorities:
That an ATCM forum, that brings together experts in the field of education and outreach, should be established as an Intersessional Contact Group; and that this forum will operate as a ‘virtual network’ to share best practice;
The initial task of this forum would be to work together to maximise the impact of the 25th Anniversary of the Madrid Protocol; and this task would provide an opportunity to assess the longer-term feasibility of the forum.

Recommendations
The workshop co-chairs recommend that these priorities and the following draft Resolution are presented for discussion at the ATCM Working Group on Operational Matters:
