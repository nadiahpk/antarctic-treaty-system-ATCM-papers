General Recommendations from the Joint Inspections undertaken by the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Environmental Protocol

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic


Summary

The United Kingdom and the Czech Republic conducted a joint Antarctic Treaty Inspection in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the 2014-15 season. Observers from each party were designated by their respective Governments in accordance with the notification procedures of Article VII (1) of the Antarctic Treaty. In accordance with Decision 7 (2013) the designation of Observers was notified to all Parties in Antarctic Treaty Secretariat Circulars 22/2014 and 23/2014.

The inspections were undertaken between 31 December and 12 January 2015. The inspections included 12 research stations, one non-governmental facility, one refuge, six cruise vessels and five yachts. All inspections were undertaken in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Environmental Protocol. The full inspection report will be submitted as an Information Paper and distributed at ATCM XXXVIII.

Detail

The Observers were made welcome at all research stations and vessels and were grateful to the Parties involved for their consideration and active and positive engagement in the inspection process. Five of the inspected cruise vessels and one yacht were flagged to non-Treaty Parties, and the Observers welcomed the full co-operation of the operators of these vessels with the inspection process.

General Recommendations 

The Observers identified a number of general recommendations arising from the inspection programme, which have relevance beyond the specific recommendations for the individual stations and vessels contained within the full inspection report. 

The ATCM and CEP are invited to consider these general recommendations and take action as agreed. 

Further information on these recommendations is set out in the full inspection report. The Observers also recorded significant examples of good practice, which are also set out in the full report. 

General 

    1. All Antarctic stations and vessels should be encouraged to complete the relevant Antarctic Treaty Inspection Checklists and make these widely available.

    2. The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat should be requested to further develop the list of inspections on its website, to show the full list of COMNAP registered Antarctic stations and facilities, together with relevant inspection reports.


    3. Station contact details, including full telephone and e-mail, which are made available through the COMNAP system, should be checked and updated by National Antarctic Programmes at the start of the season. 

    4. Parties should be actively encouraged to report station developments relevant to inspection recommendations to the ATCM and CEP. 

Personnel and training

    5. The training that all personnel and visitors, including temporary staff, receive before arriving in Antarctica should include, in addition to safety and environmental protection, clear information on the provisions of the Treaty, with particular reference to its Article IV. 

    6. National Antarctic Programmes should actively promote and enable access to their stations from a wide variety of domestic and international scientists. Parties should also consider informal exchange programmes for station support personnel, to facilitate the sharing of best practice.  

Scientific research

    7. National Antarctic Programmes should ensure they use an appropriate system of expert peer review to ensure the science undertaken in Antarctica is of the highest quality and importance, and that its impact can be established.

    8. Forward plans for the future scientific use of stations should be developed to ensure that physical presence in Antarctica delivers rigorous scientific activity and outputs.

    9. Vessel operators, IAATO and others, including SCAR, should be encouraged to consider the opportunities to maximise the scientific activity which is possible on tourist vessels in the region. In the meantime, existing activities and opportunities should be well publicised.  

    10. Human impact monitoring studies should be undertaken on stations wherever practical. 

Logistics and infrastructure

    11. National Antarctic Programmes should consider how best to ensure that renewable energy (such as solar and wind) provision can feature more prominently in the future energy provision plans for stations. 

    12. Stations with aerial masts and other non-habitable structures should consider appropriate and regular safety assessments of their structural integrity, to enable remedial or removal action to be undertaken as appropriate. 

    13. COMNAP and SCAR should be encouraged to consider assessing the impact of climatic and environmental changes on stations and facilities, particularly those in the Antarctic Peninsula, and to develop advice on how best to adapt infrastructure such as buildings, pipe-work and bulk storage systems to cope with such impacts. Parties are encouraged to conduct appropriate risk assessments in the light of predicted climate change. 

    14. The location of small scale fuel storage systems, such as drums, on Antarctic stations should be sited in ways to maximise safety, while minimising potential environmental impact. The provision of oil spill equipment and training should be the focus of renewed effort. 


Transport and Communications

    15. Consideration should be given to the best way of ensuring safe small boating operations around Antarctic stations, especially journeys using single open inflatable boats.  

Safety, Training and Emergency Procedures

    16. All stations that have not done so should review, with expert assistance if necessary, their fire safety and detection equipment. Stations with no suitable detection systems, particularly in accommodation areas, should install them as a priority. 

Environmental Management

    17. Stations should investigate opportunities to accelerate the clean-up and removal of historic waste from stations in Antarctica, including through innovative international collaborative efforts. 

    18. Parties should ensure that all new construction and development in Antarctica is subject to an environmental impact assessment (EIA) before any activity is undertaken. Stations should be involved in this process, and the completed or draft EIA should be available on the station. 

    19. Redundant infrastructure, such as fuel tanks and temporary buildings, should be removed from Antarctica to avoid the risk of inadvertent environmental contamination, wherever possible. Where there is a judgement that removal will create more impact than retention, this should be tested through the EIA process and regularly reviewed in the light of evolving techniques. 

    20. Stations without appropriate sewage treatment and discharge facilities should investigate the opportunities to update their systems, drawing on the experience of other stations’ successful use of such methods.

    21. Waste storage facilities on stations should be reviewed to ensure that waste cannot be dispersed by the wind or accessed by wildlife. 

Medical

    22. National Antarctic Programmes and vessel operators should review the provision of medical facilities and advice, including providing for rapid access to expert back-up though tele-medicine services. 

    23. COMNAP should be invited to ensure that the nature and location of specialist medical facilities (e.g. recompression chambers, X-ray facilities, automated external defibrillators), together with updated and accurate contact details, is better publicised and disseminated to both National Antarctic Programmes and vessel operators. 

Tourism

    24. Stations which receive tourist visitors should be encouraged to develop publicly available guidelines for the management of such visits including, where appropriate, Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guidelines. 

    25. IAATO should be encouraged to develop industry peer and expert reviewed guidelines for the range of activities undertaken by cruise passengers (such as kayaking, snorkelling and diving), to provide appropriate common standards, whilst recognising that individual operators must retain full responsibility for the safe conduct of such activities.

    26. IAATO and COMNAP should be encouraged to identify and disseminate best practice for the effective implementation of the CEP Non-native Species Manual.
