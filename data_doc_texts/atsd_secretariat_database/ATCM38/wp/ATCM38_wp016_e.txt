The role of Antarctica in global climate processes

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and Norway


Summary

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is due to hold its 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015.  Whilst this process is entirely separate to the Antarctic Treaty System, Antarctica is a key component in the Earth System, and research in Antarctica is a key to improving understanding the causes of current climate change and increasing confidence in future global projections.  This paper proposes that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting highlights the wealth of scientific activity and expertise on issues of climate change that already exists within the Antarctic scientific community; and also encourages national Antarctic programmes to continue this important work to further improve understanding of, and to more accurately predict, the impacts of climate change on Antarctica itself, as well as Antarctica’s influence on global dynamics in a changing climate.


Background

    1. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting has previously adopted a range of Decisions and Resolutions relating to supporting climate change research in Antarctica, and disseminating information about climate science to a wider audience.  For example:

    • Resolution 3(2007) on Long-term Scientific Monitoring and Sustained Environmental Observation in Antarctica recommended support for long-term monitoring and sustained observations of the Antarctic environment to enable the detection, and underpin the understanding and forecasting of the impacts of environmental and climate change;

    • Decision 8(2009) requested the Chair of the ATCM to forward the two ministerial declarations agreed in that year (on the International Polar Year and Polar Science and on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty) and the Review Report on Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment (ACCE) prepared by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), to the President of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC);

    • Decision 5(2010) requested the Chair of the ATCM to forward a further update of the SCAR ACCE report to the President of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), the Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Secretariat (IPCC); the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Office (WMO); and the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO);

    • Resolution 4(2010) recommended that Parties forward copies of the SCAR ACCE report to their respective departments and agencies engaged in climate change negotiations, and encouraged the dissemination of the findings of the SCAR ACCE and of ongoing Antarctic climate change research to the general public and the media.  This Resolution also recommended the SCAR ACCE report be forwarded to national Antarctic science and research bodies, along with encouragement to fully consider the findings and recommendations in the report.  Parties also welcomed further updates by SCAR on Antarctic climate change and its implications.

    2. In advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is due to be held in Paris in December 2015, the United Kingdom and Norway propose that it would be timely for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting to adopt a new Resolution to further highlight the importance of climate change science in Antarctica, and encourage national Antarctic programmes to continue this important work to further improve understanding of, and to more accurately predict, global dynamics in a changing climate.  

    3. A draft Resolution is attached for consideration by ATCM XXXVIII.



Draft Resolution: The role of Antarctica in global climate processes


 The representatives,

Noting that Antarctica plays a crucial role in the global climate system, as a key driver of global circulation in the atmosphere and ocean, as a significant control on global sea level, and as a major sink for atmospheric heat and carbon;
 
Recognising that scientific study of Antarctica is crucial to further inform understanding of global climate processes and their consequential impacts on the entire Earth System;

Conscious that climatic changes within Antarctica are resulting in considerable regional changes across the continent, including ice-shelf collapse, glacial retreat, dramatic regional changes in the duration of sea-ice cover and unpredictable weather events, and that some of these changes have the potential to impact on human activities within Antarctica;  

Welcoming the ongoing work of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) on its Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment (ACCE) initiative, and the submission of annual updates to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting about the effects of climate change on Antarctica itself;

Desiring to ensure that the international science community continues to focus their effort and collaborate effectively in the study of climate change processes within Antarctica;

Recommend that their Governments: 

    1. Encourage their national Antarctic programmes to work with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to consider how best to promote international Antarctic climate change research to the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is due to be held in Paris in December 2015; and

    2. Support their national Antarctic programmes to lead collaborative and ambitious international scientific programmes to underpin improved understanding of the role Antarctica plays in global climate processes and the impact of climatic changes on the Antarctic environment.
