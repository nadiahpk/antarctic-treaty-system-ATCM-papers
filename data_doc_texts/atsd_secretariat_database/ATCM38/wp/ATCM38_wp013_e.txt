Initial report of the intersessional contact group established to review the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica
Working Paper submitted by Australia and the United Kingdom
Summary
The 17th meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection established an open-ended intersessional contact group (ICG) to initiate a review of the 2005 Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (EIA Guidelines). This paper provides an initial report from the ICG, covering activities during the 2014/15 intersessional period. The group has reached general agreement on a number of issues that it considers should be addressed in a revision of the EIA Guidelines, and has commenced work on specific suggested modifications. The ICG has also recorded broader policy or other issues that have arisen during discussion, and that may warrant further discussion by the CEP. The Committee is invited to note this initial report, to provide any feedback on the ICG’s activities to date, and to support the continuation of the ICG for a further intersessional period.
Background
Since the CEP five-year work plan was adopted at CEP XI (2008) it has included a priority 3 issue relating to ‘Implementing and improving the EIA provisions of Annex I’, and a related action ‘Keep the EIA Guidelines under review’. At CEP XVI (2013) the possible need to revisit the guidelines was raised during discussion of several meeting papers. The Committee agreed to schedule a review of the EIA Guidelines1, and the CEP five-year work plan was updated to include the following task for the 2014/2015 intersessional period:
    • ‘Start a revision of the EIA Guidelines, including human footprint, wilderness, decommissioning of stations, etc.’2
At CEP XVII (2014), the Committee considered ATCM XXXVII/WP 29 Review of the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (Australia) and ATCM XXXVII/WP24 Improvements to the Antarctic Environmental Impact Assessment process (United Kingdom). The Committee established an ICG to initiate a review of the EIA Guidelines during the 2014/15 intersessional period.
Terms of reference
CEP XVII agreed3 that the ICG would be jointly convened by Australia and the United Kingdom, and would operate with the following terms of reference (ToR):
    1) Consider whether the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment appended to Resolution 1 (2005) should be modified to address issues including those identified in ATCM XXXVII/WP29 and, as appropriate, suggest modifications to the Guidelines.
    2) Record issues raised during discussions under ToR 1, which relate to broader policy or other issues for the development and handling of EIAs, and which may warrant further discussion by the CEP with a view to strengthening the implementation of Annex I to the Protocol.
    3) Provide an initial report to CEP XVIII.
Method of operation
The ICG commenced on 15 August 2014 when the co-conveners circulated an opening announcement to all CEP contact points, proposing that the ICG undertake its work in four stages:
    • Stage one: Agree on the ICG work plan and schedule
    • Stage two: Discuss and agree on issues that should be addressed in a revision of the EIA Guidelines, and record any broader policy or other issues that may warrant further discussion by the CEP.
    • Stage three: Discuss and agree on suggested modifications to the text of the EIA Guidelines.
    • Stage 4: Report to the CEP.
All ICG correspondence was available to CEP Members and Observers via the CEP Discussion Forum, under the topic ‘ICG on Review of the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica’. Copies of ATCM XXXVII/WP29 and ATCM XXXVII/WP24 were posted to the Discussion Forum, together with a copy of Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica as adopted under Resolution 4 (2005).
Summary of discussions
Comments were submitted to the ICG by 10 CEP Members (Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Korea (RoK), New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States) and two Observers (ASOC and IAATO). The following sections summarise the ICG discussions, with reference to the ICG terms of reference. As noted above, all submissions are available in full from the CEP Discussion Forum.
In stage one, participants agreed to the ICG work plan outlined above. The co-conveners noted the Committee’s earlier recognition that the review of the EIA Guidelines might require more than one period of intersessional work, as reflected in the instruction under ToR #3 to provide an ‘initial’ report to CEP XVIII.
ToR#1: Consider whether the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment appended to Resolution 1 (2005) should be modified to address issues including those identified in ATCM XXXVII/WP29 and, as appropriate, suggest modifications to the Guidelines
The co-conveners circulated a discussion paper to initiate stage two of the work plan, involving consideration of issues that should be addressed in a revision of the EIA Guidelines. The discussion paper listed the issues identified in ATCM XXXVII/WP29 as ‘Possible matters for consideration in a review of the EIA Guidelines’, and presented initial ideas about how each issue could be accommodated in a revision of the EIA Guidelines. ICG participants were invited to consider these ideas, and proposal any additional issues.
To summarise the results of stage two of the work plan, and to commence stage three, the conveners prepared an annotated version of the 2005 EIA Guidelines, which consolidated participants’ comments, and presented possible text changes, and recorded issues requiring further consideration. There was a further round of comments, and the annotated version of the 2005 EIA Guidelines was updated accordingly. This working document is available from the CEP Discussion Forum. 
The ICG has made good progress in its work to identify issues that should be addressed in modifications to the EIA Guidelines, and to suggest such modifications for consideration by the Committee. At the conclusion of discussions for the 2014/15 intersessional period, there was general agreement among ICG participants that the EIA Guidelines should be modified to:
    • provide new or additional guidance to emphasise the importance of:
    • taking an holistic approach to defining the scope of the proposed activity;
    • considering a range of alternatives to the proposed activity, and describing the factors considered when assessing alternatives;
    • considering opportunities for international cooperation, where appropriate;
    • considering all elements of the environment when describing the initial environmental reference state;
    • clearly identifying the methods and criteria used to assess the significance of predicted impacts;
    • considering the decommissioning phase of a proposed activity, where appropriate;
    • ensuring that mitigations measures consider in detail, where appropriate: arrangements for fuel storage handling and spill response; measures to prevent the introduction and transfer of non-native species; use of renewable energy systems; opportunities to minimise ‘footprint’; waste management arrangements;
    • considering how climate change may affect proposed activities and their associated environmental impacts; and
    • closely reflecting the language of Article 8 when stating conclusions.
    • include a table identifying environmental aspects and possible impacts of Antarctic activities, building on the table presented in the 2012 CEP Tourism Study;
    • reflect new and revised CEP procedures and resources for EIA (e.g. Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs, EIA Database);*
    • include references to relevant other guidelines and resources throughout the EIA Guidelines, as well as adding a new Resources section; and
    • make general edits / updates as appropriate (e.g. adding a Table of Contents, updating the lists of references and acronyms).*
For the above items well-developed suggested text is already under discussion by the ICG, although it may be subject to further revision in the next intersessional period. Interested Members can view the current draft text in the working document available from the CEP Discussion Forum.

Other ideas have been raised and will be the subject of further consideration within the ICG before it moves, as appropriate, to discuss suggested modifications to the EIA Guidelines. Such ideas include: 
    • presenting guidance, possibly as a checklist, on issues to consider when conducting a site assessment / collecting baseline information, to assist with understanding/describing the initial environmental reference state;
    • creating a new section (or sub-section) of the EIA Guidelines dedicated to guidance on the assessment of cumulative impacts;
    • providing guidance for considering impacts on wilderness – it has been noted in the discussion that there is no agreed definition of wilderness, and that any detailed guidance may need to be developed separate to the EIA Guidelines;
    • providing further guidance within the EIA Guidelines on verification / follow-up activities;
    • restructuring parts of the EIA Guidelines to more closely reflect the structure of Annex I and/or providing a template as a reference for structuring EIAs; and
    • presenting within the EIA Guidelines examples of best practice for elements of EIAs (e.g. matrices, maps, tables, graphs etc.)
ToR#2: Record issues raised during discussions under ToR #1, which relate to broader policy or other issues for the development and handling of EIAs, and which may warrant further discussion by the CEP with a view to strengthening the implementation of Annex I to the Protocol.
In accordance with this term of reference, the conveners are maintaining a document recording issues raised by ICG participants. This document is available from the CEP Discussion Forum. Noting that further issues may be raised as discussions continue on the revision of the EIA Guidelines, it is anticipated that a final list of issues could be presented for consideration at CEP XIX.
ToR#3: Provide an initial report to CEP XVIII.
This Working Paper represents the ICG’s report to CEP XVIII. The co-conveners are grateful for the valuable input from participants, and consider that ICG is making good progress against its terms of reference. It is anticipated that the review could be concluded during the 2015/16 intersessional period, and a final report prepared for CEP XIX, including suggested modifications to the EIA Guidelines. The co-conveners and participants would welcome feedback from the Committee regarding issues discussed to date, or which could be considered in the further work of the ICG.
Recommendations
    1. It is recommended that the CEP endorses the continuation of the ICG on Review of the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment for a second intersessional period, with a final report to be presented at CEP XIX. Australia and the United Kingdom are available to continue as ICG co-conveners, if that is the will of the Committee.
    2. If the Committee agrees with the above, it is suggested that the ICG could operate during the 2015/16 intersessional period in accordance with the following – only slightly modified – terms of reference:
    1) Continue revising the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment appended to Resolution 1 (2005) to address issues including those identified in ATCM XXXVII/WP29 and, as appropriate, suggest modifications to the Guidelines.
    2) Record issues raised during discussions under ToR 1, which relate to broader policy or other issues for the development and handling of EIAs, and which may warrant further discussion by the CEP with a view to strengthening the implementation of Annex I to the Protocol.
    3) Provide a final report to CEP XIX.
