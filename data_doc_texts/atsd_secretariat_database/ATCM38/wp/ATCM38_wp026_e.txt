Revision of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas No. 105, 155, 157, 158 and 159
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand
Introduction
In accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, New Zealand has conducted a five-yearly review of the Management Plans for:
    • ASPA 105: Beaufort Island, McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea
    • ASPA 155: Cape Evans, Ross Island
    • ASPA 157: Backdoor Bay, Cape Royds, Ross Island
    • ASPA 158: Hut Point, Ross Island
    • ASPA 159: Cape Adare, Borchgrevink Coast
The reviews were conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (1998) and all management plans were circulated for comment to personnel who have visited the Areas in the last five years.  
All revisions are minor and are outlined in the tables below.
