How to address the problem of commercial tour vessels navigating under a third-party flag in the Antarctic Treaty Area

Working paper presented by Ecuador

Abstract
Recognizing that tourism is a challenge to navigational safety as stated in WP-49 at XXXVII ATCM and acknowledging that one possible solution is the enhancing of the EIES in order to better show the data for the Parties, Ecuador and France have entered an intersesional thinking process where they came to realize that amongst others the evaluation of the risk, the registration, holding of the information, decision making, coordination and the proposal of international standards could be the answer to this shipping issue in order to keep the Antarctic waters clean and make them safer. 
Background
WP-49 to the XXXVII ATCM depicts the problem very well and made all the Parties aware of the issue and the fact that the EIES could be improved and more important that trends have to be set and risks evaluated. In doing this, the problem of monitoring the flag states performance and the information of the licensing state comes into place. Monitoring however is a practical problem, for instance in the past Antarctic tourist season from the 21st. of January to the 22nd of February 2015, 12 vessels visited the penguin breeding ground at Barrientos Island located at 62 25´ 30´´ South and 59 45´ West in the Aitcho Islands. 11 out of these vessels, a total of 91,6% came from states not parties to the treaty and out of these 9, a total of 75% were registered under Flags Of Convenience (FOC), 2 in Malta and 7 in the Bahamas. Thus, the practical side of this matter is one angle of it, nevertheless on the other hand there are more theoretical questions which are presented in the following pages.
Discussion
Analyzing from a theoretical point of view might give some practical answers as how and what to monitor referring to the vessel itself as well as on the follow up of incidents, since a frequency such like the one measured this summer of one ship each 2 or 3 days (almost none of them from a state party to the treaty) is somewhat to be concerned of, moreover since in the case of shipping events “…Antarctic Treaty Parties (ATPs) also have responsibilities placed on them by the Environmental Protocol to report to the ATCM following an incident….”1 
But there are more aspects to be covered when talking about shipping, possible incidents, insurance questions, salvage and so on, having always in mind the bottom line which can be reasonably argued is the safety of human lives at sea. For instance, UNCLOS when talking about registration establishes a genuine link between the State and the ship2, this according to previous judgments being to “…secure more effective implementation of the duties of the flag State…”3. Here we have a problem from the perspective of any maritime authority in the light of UNCLOS; having to be proficient in itself in order to enforce compliance with maritime conventions and avoid the existence of substandard ships or said otherwise to have an “…effective exercise of jurisdiction and control over its ships.”4 This being so, the next question arises, who will consistently control and watch over this issue in the Antarctic Treaty Area?, speak, who will act as the maritime authority for there is a huge amount of ocean in the treaty area? 
Going on with the argument we have the Treaty itself, which on its text implies that freedom of navigation has to be maintained on the high seas in the treaty area5. However the environmental principles stated in Art. 3 6 are a positive mandate to take action in respect of anything harmful to the polar ocean in the south, because finally the aim is to understand the global environment; hence it is useful to think that all ships in the global village, whichever flag, should be reminded to comply with regulations once they come to the treaty area. As a matter of fact further on in the same article it is stated that the monitoring should be “regular and effective” as a sort of a preventive measure. Again, the question remains open on who performs this monitoring and what to monitor, especially when it comes to shipping which is a very much unique and specific activity from all points of view, thus having to make sure that navigation is safe and consistent with the principles laid out in Art. 3, an issue which in the very essence of WP-49 above mentioned is doubtful.  
The last aspect to be addressed is the enforcement of maritime conventions as they are controlled by the Flag State, the Coastal State and the Port State Authority. In the case of the Flag State and as expressed above it is not very clear if a FOC7 State enforces the Polar Code in the first place, then again there is the question of the genuine link between the FOC State and the ship, notwithstanding that in the global maritime business the state registering the ship, the one of the owner(s), the one of the operator, the one of the administrator, the one of the P+I Club covering the ship, the one of the crewmembers and finally if applicable, the one of the charterer could be entirely different. 
On the other hand, in the shipping industry there are already a lot of certificates the owner and the captain have to produce to the maritime authority of the country the ship is in, and even so the Costa Concordia grounded. The question in this respect for the area of ocean covered by the Antarctic Treaty would be if there is a single authority which could assume the control and monitoring of the ship? The answer probably being no, it can be reasonably argued that in the Treaty Area there currently is no way to act from the perspective of a maritime authority in the light of IMO or UNCLOS; which has to be proficient in itself in order to enforce compliance with maritime conventions and avoid the existence of substandard ships or said otherwise to have an “…effective exercise of jurisdiction and control over its ships.”8  
In the following graphic the already threefold discussion comes down to answer one question: Who?

In summary and assuming that shipping in Antarctica is likely to increase here we see the need of control not solved but expanded to three areas such like the treaty itself, UNCLOS and Maritime Conventions. This, added with the obvious need of monitoring, establishing trends and risks makes us figure out who will do so? 
In this respect it might be useful to think of a new maritime authority for all Antarctic Treaty maritime matters, one central organization which could be responsible of the following:
    • Monitor all shipping traffic all year round (Parties deliver information to one central organization which later shares the information via EIES for instance).
    • Register maritime incidents/accidents.
    • Investigate maritime incidents/accidents in order to recommend new and better practices specifically designed for Antarctica.
    • Coordinate and eventually perform rescue and salvage.
    • Inspect ships.
    • Coordinate environmental response with all the governments involved.
    • Follow up on reports.
    • Develop new international laws and standards.
    • Act as an expert witness in matters relating UNCLOS or Maritime Conventions and its applicability in the Antarctic Treaty Area.
Finally it would be useful to think that this organization should have its own legal personality in order to possess “…rights, duties, powers and liabilities etc. as distinct from its members or its creators…”9 Thus the Antarctic Treaty area will see a new regulatory institution which at the end could make a difference in the protection of human lives at sea and of the environment as well.
