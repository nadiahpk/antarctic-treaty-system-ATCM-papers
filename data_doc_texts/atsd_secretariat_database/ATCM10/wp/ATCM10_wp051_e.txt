The Representatives,            

Noting that the twentieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Antarctic
Treaty falls in 1981:          

Recalling the second preambular paragraph of the Antarctic Treaty in which it
is recognized that it is in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica         
shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and     
shall not become the scene or object of international discord;               

Conscious of:                  

(a) the responsibility assumed by the Consultative Parties for the protec-
tion of the environment and the wise use of the Treaty area;               

(b) the increased understanding of the Antarctic and of its relationship     
to the world as a whole that has resulted from the endeavors of the         
Antarctic scientific community;                                            

(c) the benefits derived from the co-ordination of Antarctic scientific      
research through the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR),     
its subsidiary institutions and its co-operation with other internat-       
ional organizations having a scientific or technical interest in the       
Antarctic; and                                                               

(d) the value of the scientific advice from SCAR, requested by their        
Governments through their National Antarctic Committees, in connection     
with the development of the Antarctic Treaty system;                       

Recommend to their Governments that:
