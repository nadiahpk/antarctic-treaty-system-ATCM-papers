FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: COLLECTION OF
GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS

(Recommendation to Plenary Submitted
by the Working Group on this Agenda Item)

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recognising that an essential element in geological investigations is
the collection and removal of specimens but that the removal of
specimens from areas of exceptional geological interest needs, as
far as is practicable, to be kept to a minimum in order to avoid
prejudicing subsequent geological investigations in such areas;

Noting that this problem is presented in a more acute form in areas
where more than one expedition is undertaking geological investiga-
tions;

Noting that a similar problem has already been recognised with regard
to the collection of meteorites;

Noting that it might be appropriate to designate as Sites of Special
Scientific Interest, small areas which were of exceptional scientific
interest;

Recommend to their governments that, through their National Committees,
they refer the matter to SCAR for further study.
