IMPROVEMENT OF ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE
COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

(SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF ARGENTINA)
WHEREAS in recent years there has been a marked increase in technical and scientific activities in Antarctica to support the research being conducted independently or jointly by the countries that are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty;

AIR, sea and land movement is being engaged in actively and continuously by some countries on a year-round basis to support scientific research programs and logistical operations for the transportation of cargo and personnel;

SOME countries have already begun commercial passenger flights over the Antarctic, and commercial transantarctic flights will be inaugurated in the not too distant future;

THIS activity requires effective meteorological support in time to ensure the safety of air, sea and land operations, and for this reason meteorological data (basic and processed) from the meteorological stations installed in Antarctica must be available;

METEOROLOGICAL information is now being exchanged through the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) of the World Meteorological Organization by means of the Regional, National and World meteorological centers; and

THIS information, when communicated by such means, reaches the Antarctic meteorological centers responsible for processing meteorological forecasts with a delay of up to SIX (6) hours, which is obviously unacceptable for operational use;

It is RECOMMENDED that the signatory countries of the Antarctic Treaty implement telecommunications systems in Antarctica in order to ensure the direct inter- Antarctic exchange of meteorological data (basic and processed) among the Antarctic meteorological centers.
