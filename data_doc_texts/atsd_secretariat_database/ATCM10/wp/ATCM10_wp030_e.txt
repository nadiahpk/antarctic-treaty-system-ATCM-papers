ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE MINERAL RESOURCES IN ANTARCTICA

(Draft Recommendation on Agenda Item 5)

The Representatives,

Convinced of the need to preserve and further strengthen the international regime established in Antarctica by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, which has for 20 years guaranteed the use of Antarctica exclusively for peaceful purposes, and in the interest of the development of international cooperation;

Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Antarctic Treaty, which places responsibility upon the Participants to exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to ensure that no one engages in any activity in Antarctica contrary to the purposes and principles of the Treaty;

Conscious of the responsibility to protect the Antarctic environment in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty, in the face of the increasing interest in problems of exploration and exploitation of potential mineral resources in Antarctica;

Conscious of the special vulnerability of the Antarctic environment and of the fact that uncontrolled activities in exploration and exploitation of potential mineral resources in Antarctica, conducted without considering certain approved international rules, regulations and standards, would have a catastrophic effect on the Antarctic environment, affect the ecological balance of the Antarctic region, the ecology of the Southern Ocean  as well as the world oceans and of our whole planet;

Recalling the great role of Antarctica in forming the climate and weather of our planet;
ANT/X/30

Recognizing that there are not yet enough scientific data for 
scientifically based evaluation of the harmful consequences of 
the effects of activities involved in the exploration and exploita-
tion of Antarctic mineral resources, should such activities be 
permitted;

Noting, in this connection, an urgent need to conduct purposeful 
scientific studies to investigate and assess the impact on the 
Anctarctic environment if exploration and exploitation of Antarctic 
mineral resources were to be permitted there;

Conscious that the Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty have 
accumulated much experience in conducting scientific investigations 
in Antarctica and can substantially contribute to the protection of 
the Antarctic environment;

Declare as follows:

1. Approved international regulations, standards and rules relating 
to the protection of the Antarctic environment shall constitute 
an important part of a future international regime regulating 
activities of exploration and exploitation of mineral resources 
in Antarctica, should such activities be permitted.

2. Any activity involving exploration and exploitation of the 
Antarctic mineral resources which may be permitted after an 
approved international regime comes into force shall be con-
ducted in strict compliance with the regulations, standards 
and rules for the protection of the Antarctic environment which 
constitute the most important part of this regime and which 
have the purpose of not permitting any commercial activity in 
relation to mineral resources which would have a harmful effect 
on the Antarctic environment and violate the ecological balance 
in Antarctica.

3. No activity involving exploration or exploitation of Antarctic 
mineral resources; should such be permitted, shall be conducted 
in Specially Protected Areas defined according to Article 8 of 
the Approved Measures for the Protection of Antarctic Flora and 
Fauna, in Areas of Special Scientific Interest, or in any other 
areas to be defined in future according to Article 9, Paragraph 1 
of the Antarctic Treaty.

4. No injury to or destruction of objects or buildings having 
historical interest, or buildings and objects erected in 
Antarctica for scientific investigations, shall be permitted 
during exploration and exploitation of mineral resources, should 
such be permitted in Antarctica.
