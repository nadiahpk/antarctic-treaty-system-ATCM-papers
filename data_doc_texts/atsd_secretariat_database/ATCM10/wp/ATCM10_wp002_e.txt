THE THIRD ANTARCTIC TREATY MEETING ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS

WASHINGTON, D.C.

SEPTEMBER 11 - 15, 1978
FINAL REPORT OF THE THIRD ANTARCTIC TREATY MEETING ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS

WASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 11-15, 1978

1. In accordance with Recommendation IX-3 adopted at the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, experts from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, the Republic of South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America met in Washington on 11 September 1978 for the purpose of discussing the matters included in the Agenda transcribed below.  The Meeting was attended by an observer of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

2. The Meeting was opened by Dr. Edward P. Todd, Director of the Division of Polar Programs (and of the U.S. Antarctic Program) of the National Science Foundation, as the temporary Chairman. Mr. Alfred N. Fowler, Deputy Director of the Division of Polar Programs was unanimously elected to Chair the Meeting. Mr. Fowler announced that Miss Nadene Kennedy and Mrs. Helen Gerasimou would provide administrative support for the Chairman and were available to assist representatives.

3. Following discussion of a provisional draft the Meeting adopted the following Agenda:

A. Opening of the Meeting

B. Election of Chairman

C. Adoption of Agenda

D. Description of telecommunication operations and analysis of information exchanged pursuant to Recommendation IX-3 of the Ninth Consultative Meeting.

E. Identification of Problems

F. Discussion of Possible Solutions

G. Proposals for Improvements

H. Findings and Conclusions

I. Adoption of Final Report

J. Closing of the Meeting

4. The Meeting considered in Plenary Session all the items on the Agenda.  A Working Group chaired by Mr. I. H. Lloyd was appointed to study the transmission of antarctic meteorological data to the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) of the World Weather Watch (WWW).

5. The proceedings and conclusions of the Meeting were as set out below.

Agenda Item D

6. While it was recognized that antarctic telecommunications are required for operational, administrative and scientific purposes, in addition to the transmission
- 2 -

of meteorological data, the analysis of information provided by governments was 
carried out on the understanding that its objective was primarily to describe 
telecommunication operations as they were used for the international transmission of 
meteorological data.

7. It was considered desirable to set out such a description in diagrammatic form 
and Annexes  1, 2 and 3  to this report were prepared by the Working Group.  These 
Annexes set out:

    ANNEX 1 - the existing links for the daily international exchange of meteorological 
    data within the Antarctic;

    ANNEX 2 - the principal intra-antarctic international routes by which antarctic 
    meteorological data leaves the Antarctic;

    ANNEX 3 - the principal routes by which antarctic data enters the Global 
    Telecommunication System.

These diagrams represent the links and routes existing in September 1978.

8. Since the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Telecommunications held in Beunos 
Aires in 1969, all nations have undertaken extensive programs of equipment replacement 
and organization with a view to improving the circuit efficiencies of their tele-
communication systems.

Agenda Item E

9. Informal discussion of various aspects of antarctic telecommunications identified 
problems and difficulties in a number of areas.  In recent years changes in meteo-
rological observation, data collection, processing and dissemination techniques 
had given rise to special problems for antarctic stations which depended on the timely 
receipt of all available relevant data for the preparation of forecasts.  Some of 
these problems were of a temporary nature but others were more persistent.  It was 
recognized that some of these difficulties arose from differing national perceptions 
of their requirements and scientific priorities, and these were best addressed in 
bilateral discussions, and useful progress was made in this respect.

10. The Meeting also identified other allied difficulties of more general significance,
These were:

    (i) Difficulties of radio wave propagation across the auroral belt;

    (ii) Difficulties of circulating antarctic meteorological data to, and possibly 
    within, the GTS;

    (iii) Difficulties of assuring compatibility of systems for intra-antarctic communi-
    cations while taking advantage of new technological developments;

    (iv) Difficulties in providing radio links between stations having different 
    capabilities at different times of the year.

11. With respect to radio wave propagation problems, a useful exchange of information 
on ways and means of predicting propagation path disturbance was held, with South 
Africa, Chile and the United States describing systems presently in use or planned. 
It was agreed that these problems would benefit from the exchange of research results 
and the operational use of frequency prediction techniques.

12. With respect to difficulties of circulating antarctic meteorological data to, 
and possibly within the GTS, the Working Group noted that some deficiencies exist 
in injection and switching of antarctic data in some GTS centers as a result of the 
duplication of allocation of the CLLLL group.  The report of the Working Group is 
at Annex 4. The Meeting recognized that resolution of these difficulties within the 
GTS will ultimately require some action by the WMO in consultation with the affected 
Member countries.

Agenda Item F

13. With respect to the potential problems associated with the adoption of new 
technology, the representatives outlined their future plans for improvement.  It 
appears that a number of advances in HF equipment and error-correction devices 
operating on a standard received signal, planned for installation by various nations, 
will be totally compatible with existing systems and will serve to improve intra-
antarctic communications.

Agenda Item G

14. It appeared that possibilities associated with use of geostationary and polar-
orbiting communication satellites offer a real potential for communication improve-
ments without detriment to the intra-antarctic network.  Other alternative means 
of communications within Antarctic, such as the meteor-burst system, appeared to be 
very promising for use during periods of HF blackouts resulting from increased solar 
flare activity.  Such alternative systems would depend upon the acquisition of the 
necessary equipment.

Agenda Item H

15. The Meeting recongized that technological developments in telecommunications are 
likely to lead in the future to greater diversity in the methods adopted by national 
antarctic activities for their telecommunications purposes. These developments 
will be stimulated by differing requirements but may offer possibilities of improved 
cost-effectiveness in international antarctic communications.  There is no reason to 
discourage such developments away from conventional HF systems.  It should be borne 
in mind, however, that there will remain a need for a common system for operational, 
scientific, administrative and emergency purposes.

Agenda Item I

16. The Meeting reviewed items 1 through 15 of this text together with Annexes 1 
through 4 hereto and unanomously adopted these as the Meetings Final Report.

17. Participants in the Meeting expressed their appreciation to the Chairman, to 
Mrs. Gerasimou and to Miss Kennedy, and their thanks to Dr. Todd, to the United 
States National Science Foundation and to the United States Government for the 
facilities and support made available for the Meeting.  The Chairman and Dr. Todd 
reciprocated for the United States and presented to each delegation a copy of the 
film "Antarctic Sea Ice Growth and Decay 1973-1974."

18. The Meeting unanimously supported a proposal, and the Chairman agreed to transmit 
a suitable message to all antarctic stations.  A copy of that message is shown at 
Annex 6.

19. There being no further business on the Agenda, the Chairman closed the Meeting 
at 1700 on September 15, 1978.

20. A list of participants is shown at Annex 5. A list of documents submitted is 
shown at Annex 7.

REPORT OF THE G.T.S. WORKING GROUP

In discussion it became apparent that problems existed in both the intra and inter antarctic telecommunication circuits.  On more detailed researching of this problem, it was found that from data monitoring studies condudtcted, not all the antarctic data placed on the GTS arrived at designated centers.

The unfortunate loss of this data had caused concern to Antarctic Treaty members as it forms part of a continuing bank of recorded information for necessary long term climate study.  It was concluded that the data could become lost if its switching format could not be recognized by centers on the GTS.

Reference to the WMO Catalogue of Meteorological Bulletins, dated July 1978, showed in the Antarctic section (ANT 1) a duplication of Catalogue numbers being shared by Moscow, Melbourne, Buenos Aires and Pretoria.  The sharing of these numbers appears to have come about as an unforeseen consequence of agreed WMO procedures (Manual on the Global Telecommunication System, Volume 1). This duplication of Catalogue numbers only appears to be a problem if messages are switched using these numbers.

In some cases, the arrival of the first Bulletin is recorded by the switching circuit after it is allowed to pass. On the arrival of a second Bulletin with the same number, from a different source, the second Bulletin is rejected.

Without prejudice to a final solution to this problem, the Working Group asked and the Soviet delegate agreed that his authorities should examine the possibility of changing certain Catalogue numbers as the simplest way of achieving the desired result.

The Working Group suggested that a possible temporary solution of this problem, pending a final consideration by WMO, might lie in the amending of the Catalogue numbers as set out below:
