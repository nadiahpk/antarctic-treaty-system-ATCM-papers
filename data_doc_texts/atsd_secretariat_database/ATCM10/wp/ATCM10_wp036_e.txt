Recalling that Recommendation IX-2, operative paragraph 3, called for a meeting                
of ecological, technological, and other related experts with a view to de-                
veloping scientific programs aimed at improving predictions of the impact of                
possible technologies for mineral exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic,                
and developing measures for the prevention of damage to the environment or for                
its rehabilitation;                
                                            
Noting that such a meeting was held in Washington, D.C., as part of the Tenth                
Preparatory Meeting;                
                                            
Recommend to their Governments that:                
                                            
1.      They accept with appreciation the Report of Ecological, Technological,                
and Other Related Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in                
Antarctica (Washington, 1979), and annex the Introduction and Sections                
I and II of that report to the Report of the Tenth Consultative Meeting,                
and that they take note of the contents of that report.                
                                            
2.      They encourage SCAR, through their National Antarctic Committees, to                
define programs, taking account of the Experts Report (Washington, 1979),                
with the objectives of:                
                                            
a.      retrieving and analyzing relevant information from past observations                
and research programs;                
                                            
b.      ensuring in relation to the needs for information identified by                
the Experts Report that effective use is made of existing programs;                
                                            
c.      identifying and developing new programs that should have priority,                
taking account of the length of time required for results to become                
available.
