STATEMENT ON THE OCCASION OF THE XXth ANNIVERSARY
OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Submitted by the Delegation of France

When it was signed on December 1, 1959, at Washington, the Antarctic Treaty
established seemingly ambitious objectives.

In the first place, it was the first international instrument to exclude all
military operations from a vast region of the world (1/10 of the globe) by
providing a system for permanent inspection of the demilitarization of
Antarctica and prohibiting the use of the Southern Continent for nuclear
explosions or radioactive waste disposal. Secondly, it instituted freedom
of scientific research, emphasizing international cooperation.  This
cooperation rapidly became an active one, thanks particulary to the con-
tributions of SCAR, whose work considerably increased our knowledge about
Antarctica.

The results obtained to date in all fields prove that the 1959 wager has been
won.  So much so that the Antarctic Treaty has served as a model for other
international agreements, for many consider it an example to emulate for
strengthening peace and international security. Therefore the Consultative
Parties may congratulate themselves on what has been accomplished during
the twenty years in which the Treaty has been in existence.

Nonetheless, the work that remains to be accomplished means that we should
not be content with our previous successes.  The Treaty has not resolved
all of the problems in Antarctica and in the unique and fragile ecosystem
which surrounds it.  Certainly all of the Consultative Parties are aware of the
complexity of the problems which they must confront, but the development of
knowledge about the Southern Continent and the interest in Antarctica shown
by the International Community are two factors which encourage further
progress.

The Consultative Parties do not intend to evade their responsibilities within
the context of the Treaty of Washington, which are also reflected in the
measures which they have taken together since 1959.

Strengthened by the experience which they have acquired, they affirm their
will to continue the work being undertaken in Antarctica out of concern
for the interests of all humanity.
