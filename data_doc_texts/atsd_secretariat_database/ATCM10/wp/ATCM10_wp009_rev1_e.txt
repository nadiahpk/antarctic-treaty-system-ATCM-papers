FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: SITES
OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

DRAFT MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR AN ADDITIONAL SSSI IN ADMIRALTY BAY,
KING GEORGE ISLAND, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS

(Submitted by the Delegation of Poland)

MANAGEMENT PLAN

I.      Description of Site:

All that area within lines drawn connecting Telefon Rocks, The Tower,
Jardine Peak, Napier Rocks, Demay Point and Telefon Rocks.  The boundaries
are shown on the attached map.  The site comprises coastal area and narrow
belt of near shore marine environment.

II.     Reason for Designation:

Area demarcated is of exceptional scientific interest.  It supports large
colonies of three pygoscelid pengiun species as well as breeding colonies
ot Weddelli seal and Elephant seal.  These colonies are the object of long-
term studies by scientists from a number of national programmes.  Tourist
traffic in the area should be controlled in order to avoid accidental but
possibly harmful interference with these colonies and their associated
habitat.

III.    Outline of Research:

The purpose of the investigations is to gain insight into the dynamics of
a typical Antarctic beach environment where there are breeding colonies of
both birds and seals.  Studies of the functioning of the coastal zone in
relation to that beach environment will include quantitative studies of
the circulation of matter and energy flow in near shore and coastal zones.

IV.   Date of expiry of Designation:

March 31, 1985.

V.    Access Points:

The site should only be entered from the vicinity of Point Thomas.

VI.   Pedestrians and Vehicular Routes:

Vehicles should not enter the site.  Pedestrians should not move through
the populated areas except as necessary in the course of scientific
investigations.

VII.  Other kind of Scientific Investigations which would not cause
harmful interference:

Scientific investigation which will not cause significant disturbance
to the biological programmes mentioned in section (iii).

VIII. Scientific Sampling:

Scientific sampling, other than that associated with the research programme
described above, should be kept to a minimum.

IX.   Other Restraints:

Ships should, as far as possible, avoid the area; helicopters and low-flying
aircraft should avoid the breeding colonies of birds in accordance with the
Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.
