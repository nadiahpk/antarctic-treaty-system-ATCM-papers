II. Reason for designation:

Since February 20, 1976 the Polish Academy of Sciences has
been leading complex research works in the region of H.Arctowski
Station, at Admiralty Bay and adjacent area. The purpose of the
works is to gain complete knowledge of the natural environment
of the Antarctic and to understand the functioning of the coastal
zone as part of the antarctic ecosystem. In Admiralty Bay and
adjacent area of cover drainage basin of Admiralty Bay we are
planning to continue quantitative and qualitative research up to
1983 year. This site is of exeptional scientific interest and
therefore requires a long-term protection from possible harmful
interference.

III. Outline of Research

According with Polish Antarctic Programme Guidelines:
" Complex research of the Antarctic as a basis of recognition
and Protection of Antarctic natural environment and natural
resources " presented at XV SCAR Meeting by Professor A.Urbanek
and Professor W.S. Benninghoff /enclosed/.

IV. Date of expiry of Designation

March 31, 1983

V. Access Points:

Not applicable.

VI. Pedestrian and Vehicular Routes:

Not applicable.
- 7 -

VII. Other kinds of Scientific Investigations which would
not cause harmful interference:

To protect the execution of the establishing of SSSI we
propose to contact each time the head of the Arctowski Station
in all the following matters:

- entrance of ships to the mentioned above region,
- flights and landing of airplanes and helicopters,
- landing of tourists and other groups including scientific
groups,
- conduct of any building works,
- drilling, geological and seismic works with the use of
explosive materials on land and sea,
- collecting of land flora and fauna,
- collecting of marine algae,
- fishing of or marking of planctonic, organisms, fishes, birds
and marine mammals.

VIII. Scientific sampling

Samples from tha Admiralty Bay and adjacent area should only
be taken for compelling scientific purposes.

IX. Other Restraints:

     Marine pollution from ships.

ANNEX to the Proposal of the Polish Delegation concerning the Coastal Site 
of Special Scientific Interest, Admiralty Bay and Adjacent Area, King George 
Island, Southern Shetlands.

REPORT OF THE AD HOC MEETING, 19 MAY, 1978,
CONCERNING A PROPOSED SSSI FOR ADMIRALTY BAY, KING GEORGE ISLAND

In response to the recommendation of the Sub-Committee on Conservation and 
the Biology Working Group (Recommendation 1978 BIOL 11) concerning schedul-
ing a new SSSI in the Admiralty Bay area, King George Island, a joint 
Polish--United States informal meeting was held on 19 May 1978.  The par-
ticipants at this meeting were:
        Benninghoff, W. S.     (USA)
        Urbanek, A.            (Poland)
        Rakusa-Suszczewski, S. (Poland)
        Valencia, J.           (Chile)
        Gallardo, V. A.        (Chile)
        Tomo, A. P.            (Argentina)

After presentation by the Polish participants of the guidelines to the 
draft proposal (copy attached), it was decided unanimously that a previous 
draft proposal by the U. S., stemming from an original initiative by Pro-
fessor Muller-Schwarze should be broadened to embrace:

1) the scope of complex investigations within the Admiralty Bay 
area already being undertaken by the Antarctic Station named 
after M. Arctowski of the Polish Academy of Sciences;

2) continuation of behavioural, population, and comparative 
physiological studies on pygoscelid penguins based on rookeries 
in the Point Thomas area;

3) research on the benthic fauna of Admiralty Bay with periodic 
sampling (Argentina);

4) studies on the biology of marine mammals (Chile).

The proposed SSSI should therefore include the entire or major part of 
Admiralty Bay. Safeguarding research in progress and control of tourists 
and tourist vessels in the Admiralty Bay area are the major concerns.

A detailed delimitation of the SSSI boundaries will be suggested by the 
Polish National Committee, which will receive and incorporate suggestions 
from Argentina, Chile, and the U. S. The Polish National Committee will 
then submit draft copies of the complete proposal with an accompanying map 
to the Chairman of the Logistics Working Group.  Upon receipt of approval 
by the Logistics Working Group, the Polish National Committee will circulate 
draft copies of the proposal to all National Committees. If no objections or 
emendations are received after an interval of two months from a given National 
Committee, it will be assumed that approval was indicated.

In conclusion, this meeting concurs with the Biology Working Group
Recommendation 1978 BIOL 11 urging SCAR to approve the scheduling of an
SSSI for the Admiralty Bay area in principle, in order that the proposed
SSSI could be designated at the next Antarctic Treaty meeting.
