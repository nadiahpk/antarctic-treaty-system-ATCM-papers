MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Working Group on Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment met on 24, 25
and 28 September 1979.

The Working Group had before it a recommendation emanating from the Fifteenth
Meeting of SCAR held in Chamonix in May 1978. This recommended that the dates
of expiry of the designation of seven Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSI's) should be extended, and proposed management plans for two additional
SSSI's. One of these, submitted by the Chilean Delegation to the Tenth Con-
sultative Meeting, included two small benthic habitats in Chile Bay, Greenwich
Island; the other submitted by the Polish Delegation, included areas of both
land and sea in Admiralty Bay, King George Island. The Working Group also had
before it a proposal submitted by the New Zealand Delegation about the collection
of geological specimens and a proposal submitted by the Chilean Delegation con-
cerning natural disasters which could have a catastrophic effect on structures,
installations and fuel depots in the Antarctic thereby harming the Antarctic
environment.

The three draft Recommendations submitted by the Working Group in its Report to
Plenary covered the extension of the expiry dates of designation of the seven
existing SSSI's, the collection of geological specimens and the management plan
for a terrestrial SSSI on the western shore of Admiralty Bay. The question of
designating solely marine SSI's or SSSI's including both terrestrial and marine
areas raised concerns that were not resolved in the time available. The at-
tention of Governments is drawn to the management plan for Chile Bay so that
they may be prepared to discuss further the question of management plans for
SSSI's including marine areas prior to and at the Eleventh Consultative Meeting.

The Chilean Delegation's proposal concerning natural disasters was studied with
interest and was passed to the Working Group on the Ecological and Technological
Aspects of Minerals for further consideration (see para. /number to be inserted/
above).

COLLECTION OF GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS              ORIGINAL:  English

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recognising that an essential element in geological investigations is the 
collection and removal of specimens but that the removal of specimens from 
areas which are of exceptional geological interest needs, as far as is 
practicable, to be kept to a minimum in order to avoid prejudicing sub-
sequent geological investigations in such areas;

Noting that:

(i)     this problem is presented in a more acute form in areas where more than 
        one expedition is undertaking geological investigations;

(ii)    a similar problem has already been recognised with regard to the 
        collection of meteorites;

(iii)  it might be appropriate to designate small areas which are of exceptional 
        geological interest as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

Recommend to their Governments that, through their National Committees, they 
refer the matter to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) 
for further study.

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
INTERIM GUIDELINES

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VII-3, VIII-3 and VIII-4;

Noting that a management plan has been prepared for a Site of Special
Scientific Interest on the western shore of Admiralty Bay, King George
Island;

Considering that it would be advantageous to gather experience of the practical
effect of the management plan prepared for this Site;

Recommend to their Governments that they voluntarily take account of the
management plan, annexed to this recommendation, for Site No. 8 western
shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island.

ANNEX
ANT/X/9 (Rev. 3)

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST No. 8
WESTERN SHORE OF ADMIRALTY BAY, KING GEORGE ISLAND

MANAGEMENT PLAN

(i) Description of Site

All that area on the western shore of Admiralty Bay, south of Ezcurra Inlet,
south of a line connecting Jardine Peak and the shoreline immediately to the
north of a prominent group of rocks characterized by a covering of orange
lichens bearing approximately 0680 from Jardine Peak, and east of a line
joining Jardine Peak, The Tower and a point on shore line bearing 1800 from
The Tower.

(ii) Reason for Designation

This area is one of exceptional scientific interest close to a research station
frequently visited by tourist ships. It supports an exceptional assemblage of
Antarctic birds and mammals.  Long-term research programs could be jeopardised
by accidental interference, especially during the breeding season of these
animals.

(iii) Outline of Research

The area supports a breeding colony of Elephant seals and the three species of
pygoscelid penguins in association with eight species of flighted birds.  The
purpose of the investigations is to gain insight into the dynamics of a typi-
cal, but particularly rich, Antarctic coastal ecosystem. Studies of the func-
tioning of the inshore and coastal zone in relation to that ecosystem will
include quantitative studies of the circulation of matter and energy between
the coastal and marine environments.

(iv) Date of expiry of Designation

31 March 1985.

(v) Access Points

The site should be entered only from the vicinity of Point Thomas.

(vi) Pedestrians and Vehicular Routes

Vehicles should not enter the site.  Pedestrians should not move through the
populated areas, especially during the breeding season, except as necessary in
the course of scientific investigations.

(vii) Other kinds of Scientific Investigations Which Would Not Cause Harmful
Interference

Scientific investigation which will not cause significant disturbance to the
biological programmes mentioned in section (iii) above.

(viii)  Scientific Sampling

Scientific sampling, other than that associated with the research programme de-
scribed above, should be kept to a minimum and in accordance with the Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

(ix)  Other Restraints

Helicopters and low-flying aircraft should avoid the breeding colonies of birds
in accordance with the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna
and Flora.

       Special Scientific Interest designated in Recommendation VIII-4;

(ii)   experience of the practical effect of the management plans for these 
       sites had shown them to be an effective means of reducing the risk of 
       harmful interference in areas of exceptional scientific interest;

(iii)  no change to these management plans had been proposed by SCAR;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.     The date of expiry of designation of the following sites should be

of these sites are observed.
