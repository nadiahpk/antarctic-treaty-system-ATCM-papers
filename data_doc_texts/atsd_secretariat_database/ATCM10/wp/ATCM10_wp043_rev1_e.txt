PETROLEUM POLLUTION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT				

Report to be included in the final report				
of the Consultative Meeting.				
(Drafted by the Chairman of the Working Group)				

The Working Group appointed to study Item 9 on the Agenda met in three working				
sessions under the Chairmanship of Mr. J.P. Bloch.				

The work was organized in accordance with the various paragraphs of				
Recommendation IX. 6.				

First it examined Part III of the report by the group of experts on ecological,				
technical, and related matters concerning mineral resource prospecting and				
exploitation in Antarctica, taking into account the three reports which				
were submitted during the meeting held in Washington in June, 1979.  These				
reports dealt with the problems of pollution of Antarctic waters.				

Next it noted the information provided by the Delegation of Chile on the				
observations made after the Metula ran aground in the Straits of Magellan.				

After examining matters related to measuring the hydrocarbon content of				
seawater, it was interested in the problem of preventing risks of pollution				
by ships, which in its opinion is the main potential source of such pollution.
