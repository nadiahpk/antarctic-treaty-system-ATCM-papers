PROPOSAL BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILE               
CONCERNING MARINE SITES OF SCIENTIFIC INTEREST               
IN CHILE BAY ON GREENWICH ISLAND (SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS)               

Considering that at the VII Consultative Antarctic Meeting a recommendation to               
the governments (VII-3) was adopted inviting SCAR, through their National Com-               
mittees, to consider and draft suggestions for the designation of sites of               
Special Scientific Interest, along with a descriptive plan for each one;               

Bearing in mind Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and the aforementioned recom-               
mendation VII-3, the Eighth Meeting of the Consultative Parties to the Ant-               
arctic Treaty adopted recommendation VIII-3, proposing to their governments that,               
until such time as the recommendations designating Sites of Special Scientific               
Interest became effective, in accordance with the provisions of Article IX of               
the Antarctic Treaty, those Recommendations should be considered as guidelines;               

The Delegation of Chile at the X Consultative Meeting proposes the following               
marine sites as of Special Scientific Interest, for which it requests the               
approval of the Representatives of said Consultative Parties;               

The present proposal is referred to in the report of the Executive Committee of               
SCAR on its meeting in Cambridge (United Kingdom) from June 26 to June 29, 1979,               
paragraph 4-a-1, "Chile Bay", which states the following:               

"Chile Bay: A revised proposal had been circulated to the members of               
the Working Group on Biology and to the Secretary of the Working Group               
on Logistics in July 1978.  In the absence of any objections having               
been received, it was agreed to circulate copies to National Committees               
and to request them to forward the proposal to their governments in               
accordance with Rec XV-BIOL-9."

MARINE SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
CHILE BAY, GREENWICH ISLAND

MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. Description of Site

The site comprises two tracts of benthic habitat located as follows:

Benthic Habitat A:  Between 50 and 100 m depth and the following co-
ordinates:

Lat. S: 62°28,9'        Long. W: 59°41'12"
Lat. S: 62°29,3'        Long. W: 59°41'43"

Benthic Habitat B:  Between 100 and 200 m depth and the following co-
ordinates:

Lat. S: 62°28,3'        Long. W: 59°40'15"
Lat. S: 62°28,7'        Long. W: 59°40'47"

2. Reason for Designation

In Chile Bay there has been continued quantitative and qualitative benthic
research since 1967. Data being accumulated provides a baseline for long-
term investigations. The site is of exceptional scientific interest and
therefore requires a long-term protection from possible harmful inter-
ference.

3. Outline of Research

A long-term research programme was started in 1967 in connection with the
benthic fauna reestablishment study of Foster Port, Deception Island,
following volcanic eruptions of December 1967. Chile Bay has been design-
ated as control study area. These studies are performed yearly during
the summer.  The community criterion to observe biota changes will be
implemented with other acceptable criteria in order to comply with requi-
sites of a long-term biological monitoring program.

4. Date of Expiry of Designation

March, 1983.

5. Access Points

Although access points as such are not applicable, free passage of ships
through these areas is not in anyway prejudiced.

6. Pedestrian and Vehicular Routes

Not applicable.

7. Other Kinds of Scientific Investigations Which Would Not Cause Harmful 
Interference

Scientific research other than benthic.

8. Scientific Sampling

Samples from the benthic habitats should only be taken for compelling 
scientific purposes.

9. Other Restraints

Marine pollution from ships and bottom trawling should be avoided.  Anchor-
ing should be performed under compelling circumstances only.

PROPOSAL BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILE
CONCERNING A MARINE SITE OF SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
IN CHILE BAY ON GREENWICH ISLAND (SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS)

Considering that at the VII Consultative Antarctic Meeting a recommendation to
the governments (VII-3) was adopted inviting SCAR, through their National Com-
mittees, to consider and draft suggestions for the designation of sites of
Special Scientific Interest, along with a descriptive plan for each one;

Bearing in mind Article III of the Antarctic Treaty and the aforementioned recom-
mendation VII-3, the Eighth Meeting of the Consultative Parties to the Antarc-
tic Treaty adopted recommendation VIII-3, proposing to their governments that,
until such time as the recommendations designating Sites of Special Scientific
Interest became effective, in accordance with the provisions of Article IX of
the Antarctic Treaty, those Recommendations should be considered as guidelines;

The Delegation of Chile at the X Consultative Meeting proposes the following
marine site as of Special Scientific Interest, for adoption in accordance with
the same provisions as those contained in Recom. VIII-4.

The present proposal is referred to in the report of the Executive Committee of
SCAR on its meeting in Cambridge (United Kingdom) from June 26 to June 29, 1979,
paragraph 4-a-1, "Chile Bay", which states the following:

"Chile Bay: A revised proposal had been circulated to the members of the
Working Group on Biology and to the Secretary of the Working Group on
Logistics in July 1978. In the absence of any objections having been
received, it was agreed to circulate copies to National Committees and to
request them to forward the proposal to their governments in accordance
with Rec XV-BIOL-9."

MARINE SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
CHILE BAY, GREENWICH ISLAND

MANAGEMENT PLAN

(i) Description of Site

The site comprises two small areas of benthic habitat located as follows:

Benthic Habitat A:     Between 50 and 100 m depth and the following co-ordinates:

                       Lat. S: 62°28,9'        Long. W: 59°41'12"
                       Lat. S: 62°29,3'        Long. W: 59°41'43"

Benthic Habitat B:     Between 100 and 200 m depth and the following co-ordinates:

                       Lat. S: 62°28,3'        Long. W: 59°40'15"
                       Lat. S: 62°28,7'        Long. W: 59°40'47"

(ii) Reason for Designation

These two areas are the subject of long term research programs and the purpose of designating them is, as far as possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interference which could jeopardise these scientific investigations.

(iii) Outline of Research

Following the volcanic eruptions of December 1967 in Deception Island, a long-term research program was initiated in Port Foster to study the re-establishment of the benthic fauna and flora. The two areas in Chile Bay are similar hydrographically and bathymetrically to the areas being studied in Port Foster and have been chosen in order to provide control areas and for purposes of comparative study. The active part of the research program is being undertaken, for the most part, in Port Foster but it is important that the areas in Chile Bay should not be disturbed, as far as practicable, by extraneous influences other than those associated with the necessary scientific sampling procedures.

(iv) Date of Expiry of Designation

March, 1983.

(v) Access Points

Although access points as such are not applicable, free passage of ships through these areas is not in any way prejudiced.

(vi) Pedestrian and Vehicular Routes

Not applicable.

(vii) Other Kinds of Scientific Investigations which Would Not Cause Harmful 
      Interference

      Scientific research in the water above the areas other than that which 
would grossly disturb the benthic communities.

(viii) Scientific Sampling

      Samples from the benthic habitats should only be taken for compelling 
scientific purposes.

(ix)  Other Restraints

      The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling should be avoided. 
Anchoring should be avoided other than in compelling circumstances.
