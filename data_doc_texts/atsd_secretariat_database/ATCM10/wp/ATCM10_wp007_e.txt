IMPROVEMENT OF ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OF THE COLLECTION AND 
DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA

Document submitted by the Delegation of Chile

I.- BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROBLEM IN QUESTION.

1.- The meeting of the W.M.O. Antarctic working group held in Australia in 
1966, included, among other recommendations, the creation of Regional 
Antarctic Meteorological Centers.

2.- At the Second Meeting of Antarctic Telecommunications Experts, held in 
Buenos Aires during 1969, the required system was set up for carrying 
out administrative, operational, and scientific activities in 
Antarctica with respect to the collection and distribution of 
meteorological data.

3.- During the course of the III Meeting of Antarctic Telecommunications 
Experts, held in Washington, D.C. in September, 1978, the possibility 
was suggested of establishing bilateral contacts providing alternatives 
to the current system, which was proposed in turn by the World 
Meteorological Office and accepted by the Parties, and which consisted 
of a network through which the Regional Centers would channel informa-
tion.  This solution, which required further elaboration, due to the 
technical nature of this meeting, is in conformity with Chile's ideas 
upon the subject, provided that such a procedure would be an alternative 
solution, as was suggested originally.

II.- IMPROVEMENT OF THE LINKS

1.- Since 1966, the Member Nations of the Treaty, motivated by a natural 
wish to obtain reliable and efficient links in order to meet their 
own requirements, have been developing systems and implementing means 
of ensuring a telecommunications flow which would enable them to 
exchange administrative and meteorological information promptly.

2.- Although this approach is valid and understandable, it has led the

countries involved in the System to deploy major technical, scientific 
and economic efforts toward this end, and since these efforts were 
not implemented with due coordination, the result has been:

a)  Duplication of efforts, which led to a lack of optimization 
of valuable resources.

b)  Confusion in traffic with respect to the origin of the 
information, and

c)  Flooding and disorder in transmission schedules and in the 
use of the available frequencies.

For these reasons Chile is of the opinion that during the course of 
this meeting the Member Nations of the Antarctic Treaty would do 
well to find an appropriate and efficient system, based upon the one 
previously established by the World Meteorological Office (WMO), 
which should be improved in order to overcome its previously noted 
deficiencies.

III.- EFFORTS MADE BY CHILE IN ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS FOR THE 
COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION.

1.-     Chile has made an effort to implement its resources in order to comply 
in full with the commitment it made with the World Meteorological 
Office in 1966 to establish, maintain, and improve a Regional 
Antarctic Meteorological Center.

2.-     For this purpose, its work has been directed especially toward the 
following areas:

    a)  Development of an Antarctic environmental data collection system 
by using remote sensors and man-made satellites.

        To date Chilean scientists have gained invaluable experience, 
which is the product of three consecutive years of work, and 
which they will gladly share.  Their most recent achievements 
are included for information in Annex A of this paper.

    b)  Renovation of telecommunication equipment.

        In order to improve direct links with the other Meteorological 
Centers, we have continued to develop our means of compliance 
with the system, attached as Annex B.

IV.-    RECOMMENDATIONS

In conformity with the foregoing, the delegation of Chile proposes 
the recommendations which it considers relevant and which are 
included in Annex C, enclosed.

IMPROVEMENT OF ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OF THE COLLECTION 
AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA

RENOVATION OF TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT

1.- In compliance with its commitments, Chile has acted as follows:

a) Since 1967 it has set up 500 Watt amplitude modulation 
transmitters which make it possible to send meteorological 
transmissions every three hours from Isla Decepcion 
throughout the entire region and to channel them via Punta 
Arenas - Pudahuel to the World Center in Washington.

b) The eruption which took place on Decepcion in 1967 made it 
necessary for Chile to plan and construct a new installation, 
now located on King George Island. Since then, first with 
low power A.M. equipment, and later with 1 - 5 Kilowatt SSB 
equipment, connected to high gain rhombic antennas, Chilean 
transmissions were improved by incorporating the radio-
teletype method which made it possible to increase the 
volume of information to the region and to the World Center 
in Washington through direct transmission through Pudahuel.

    Frei Base also has 2 radio-assistance stations.

2.- During the last 2 years, in response to its commitment to operate a 
Regional Meteorological Center in Antarctica, Chile improved the 
the system in order to send more complete and reliable 
meterological information to the Antarctic Peninsula. In order to 
do so, the following measures were adopted:

a) Installation of 10 Kilowatt transmitter with antennas aimed 
at McMurdo and Molodezhnaya to ensure good reception at 
those centers of all meteorological data from our region, 
through radioteletype, including forecasts made on synoptic 
charts and sent in facsimile.

b) Incorporation in the new Reception Center of automatic pre-
selection units and wide band antenna which will make it 
possible to improve the signals received henceforth at Frei 
Station.

c) Meteorological information sent to the World Center in 
Washington henceforth will have 2 alternative routes:
    - To Melbourne via McMurdo,
    - To Moscow via Molodezhnaya.

d) Integration of remote sensors and man-made satellites, which 
is already in an advanced experimental stage, will make it 
possible for the President Frei Meteorological Center to 
receive surface information with satisfactory and constant 
speed of transmission from uninhabited points on the Peninsula 
via Sensor-satellite-Santiago Pudahuel-Frei Station.

3.-  In this way, after the next season, Chile will be in a position to offer
all of the Member Nations of the Antarctic Treaty an efficient system
which will make it possible to provide all the necessary links and
information, with which it will meet all of their needs in full.
