DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM USING
REMOTE SENSORS AND SATELLITES

ANNEX "A"


1. BACKGROUND

This paper deals with the main features and the preliminary results of
Chilean activities relating to the establishment of an automatic satellite
environmental data collection system in the Antarctic Peninsula.  This
technology, known as the satellite Data Collection System (DCS), enables
the automatic, reliable, economical, and nearly instantaneous collection
of data from isolated areas. Bascially, it consists of a network of
autonomous sensing stations situated so as to suit researchers' needs.
These stations relay data to a central receiving station.

Chilean activities began during the 1977/78 season. At present, four
meteorological stations are relaying information to Santiago via LANDSAT
and GOES satellites. The use of Nimbus and Tiros-N satellites is being
considered. These satellites make it possible to work with mobile sensing
stations such as ocean buoys and atmospheric balloons. Thus a fast and
reliable environmental data collection system will be operating on the
Antarctic Peninsula in the near future. Data collected by means of this
system will supplement the data collected by conventional means by the
Presidente Frei Antarctic Regional Meteorological Center.  In this manner,
complete data will be broadcast to Antarctic bases. This system could
also be expanded to form a Global Antarctic System, as proposed by the
Chilean delegation during the Third Antarctic Telecommunications Meeting,
held at Washington, D.C. in September 1978. The preliminary results of
the Chilean activities suggest that the use of satellite data collection
systems in Antarctica is quite feasible.

2. INTRODUCTION

Because of the urgent need to study and to collect environmental data
from isolated sites on the Antarctic Peninsula, Chile decided to experiment
and to apply new technologies to solve these problems.  This gave rise to
the development of Chile's Remote Sensing Program.  This Program comprises
the use of multi-spectrum (ultraviolet, visible, infrared, etc), multi-
temporal (different times), and multi-level (satellite, airplane, ground,
etc.) photographs and images duly supplemented by ground data collected
from isolated sites by satellite. Remote sensing techniques are well known
throughout the world because of their succesful use in the study and
management of natural resources, inasmuch as they lead to good results
faster and more reliably and economically than conventional methods.  The
Remote Sensing Program developed by Chile in the Antarctic Peninsula has
two main objectives:

(1) Acquisition of knowledge about environmental conditions;

(2) Acquisition of knowledge about and protection of natural resources.
- 3 -

The first objective is directly related to Antarctic telecommunications. Therefore, the main features of the Chilean activities are explained below.

3. MAIN FEATURES OF SATELLITE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS

A satellite Data Collection System (DCS) comprises three subsystems:

(a) A network of automatic sensing stations called Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) that send environmental data to a satellite according to the researchers' requirements;

(b) A satellite polar-orbit or geostationary) that relays data from the DCPs to a ground receiving station;

(c) A ground receiving station that receives, decodes, and processes data and distributes it to users in appropriate computer format.

Figure No. 1 shows a general outline of a DCS and Figure No. 2 shows a typical DCP installation plan.

At present LANDSAT and GOES satellites are being used to relay the meteorological data collected by four DCPs installed by Chile on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Nimbus and Tiros-N satellites will also be for this purpose in the future, inasmuch as their features enable them to relay data from mobile DCPs (ocean buoys and atmospheric balloons), to determine their position, and to receive evaluated environmental data. Because DCPs use very little power it is possible to recharge their 12-volt batteries by using solar panels or small wind chargers.

The LANDSAT series is operated by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). LANDSAT-3 is now being used to relay data. This series has a nearly circular polar orbit at about 900-kilometer altitude and it completes 14 revolutions per day. The orbit path moves daily in a westerly direction in 18-day cycles, which enables the satellite to obtain high resolution images of the entire planet. The satellite only relays DCP data when crossing the DCP-receiving station mutual visibility zone, as shown in Figure No. 3. Moreover, it crosses this zone at least once every 12 hours and it remains in it from 5 to 10 minutes each time.

DCPs store up to 12 readings of sensor data and transmit them, normally every 90 seconds. Usually no more than 3 or 4 groups of stored data are used (which is equivalent to reading the sensors every 3 to 4 hours); therefore, their transmission takes no more than 4 to 6 minutes. In this manner, under normal conditions, information read every 3 to 4 hours may be relayed every 12 hours. Sometimes this is not enough and geostationary satellites must be used to increase data relaying capacity. However, this type of satellite has problems in relaying data from DCPs located at latitudes exceeding 75°N or 75° S. Up to eight different analogue sensors can be employed in each DCP.

LANDSAT has one sole channel (401.5 MHz) that enables it to operate 
with about one thousand DCPs on a random access basis (without a DCP data 
transmission schedule).

The GOES series is operated by the United States National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This series consists of geo-
stationary satellites located at about 36,000 kilometer altitude.

The system comprises two satellites located at 75°W and 135°W longitude 
over the equator and two reserve satellites (one in orbit and one on the 
ground; the latter capable of being launched within 30 days).  There is 
permanent visibility between the DCPs and the receiving stations located 
in the broad zone of activity of every satellite, as shown on Figure No. 4. 
For this reason, the DCP data transmission are rigidly scheduled in terms 
of frequency and time.  Every satellite has 100 channels on the 401.5-
401.75 MHz band for self-programmed DCPs and 100 channels on the 401.75-
402.0 MHz band for DCPs that must be queried.

Self-programmed DCPs transmit data at fixed intervals set by the 
researcher during their installation.  These intervals range from 15 
minutes to 63 hours and 45 minutes, in 15 minute increments.

DCPs that are queried can send information at any time.  A query signal 
is sent by the receiving/command station through the satellite to activate 
the DCP transmission.

The power consumption of these DCPs is higher than that of the self-
programmed DCPs.

Both types of DCP can read the sensors at 6- or 15-minute increments 
over total reading periods ranging from 6 minutes to 63 hours and 45 
minutes.

Usually self-programmed DCPs read sensors every 15 minutes, store the 
data, and transmit them every 3 hours.  DCPs that must be queried usually 
operate every 3 hours, but in emergency situations they may be queried at 
any time.

Each satellite can operate with about 30,000 DCPs.  This system is 
more effective than polar satellite systems, although its operation is 
limited to a zone between 75°N or 75°S latitude.  Moreover, the system 
cannot be operated with mobile DCPs.

A Global Meteorological Observation System has been created through 
the WMO consisting of polar-orbit and geostationary satellites that obtain 
DCP images and data.  This sytem could be used to establish an Antarctic 
Global Environmental Data Collection System.

4.  MAIN FEATURES OF THE CHILEAN PROGRAM ON THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA AND 
POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF THE SYSTEM TO COVER THE ALL OF ANTARCTICA

This Program contemplates a network of fixed and mobile sensing stations 
(DCPs) on the Antarctic Peninsula.

These sensing stations will measure chiefly meteorological parameters, 
but they will also measure others relating to glacio1ogy, hydrography, 
oceanography, vulcanology, ecology, etc.

The information measured by these DCPs will be relayed to Santiago 
via geostationary and polar-orbit satellites.

The DCPs will send their data via satellite to the satellite data 
receiving station at Santiago.  A telemetric link will enable sending these 
data rapidly from Pudahuel, the President Frei Antarctic Regional 
Meteorological Center on the Antarctic Peninsula, from where they will be 
distributed to other bases on the Peninsula and throughout the Continent 
through the other Regional Meteorological Centers.

Figure No. 6 shows an outline of the plan.

The role of the President Frei Base as an Antarctic Regional 
Meteorological Center will thus be substantially increased for the benefit 
of the entire Antarctic community.

Most of the infrastructure is in place and will be significantly 
improved during 1980 and 1981, as noted in Annex B to the presentation 
of the Delegation of Chile at this Tenth Consultative Meeting.

At present, LANDSAT data is being received directly at the Santiago 
NASA station.  It is hoped that during the first half of 1980 it will also 
be possible to receive directly data sent by the GOES satellite.  Meanwhile, 
GOES data is being received by NOAA in the United States and mailed to 
Santiago under a cooperation agreement concluded between NOAA, the U.S. 
Geological Survey, NASA, and the University of Chile. For the time being, 
this delay is inconsequential, inasmuch as the project is still in an 
experimental stage.

The system planned by Chile for establishment on the Antarctic 
Peninsula may be expanded to form an Antarctic Global system that will 
make it possible to supplement conventionally collected meteorological 
data throughout the continent.  The three existing Antarctic Regional 
Meteorological Centers (Frei, McMurdo, and Molodeshnaya) may form the 
basis of this global system without ruling out the possibility of parti-
cipation by other Antarctic Centers for the purpose of supplementing the 
work of the Regional Centers.  The basic idea is to have each Regional 
Center collect the data corresponding to the DCPs located in its own 
region and distribute them, together with the data collected by con-
ventional means, to the Antarctic bases in its zone and to other regional 
Centers.  Figure No. 7 summarizes this idea.

In this connection, the following thoughts should be borne in mind:

(a) It would be desirable for the regional networks to be 
established with contributions from the countries that 
have established bases in the region of each Regional Center.

(b) Using the present geostationary and polar-orbit satellite 
system that constitutes the World Meteorological Observation 
system, data collection for each region could be carried out 
by receiving stations located in Antarctica or in the 
countries concerned, as necessary.

5. MAIN FEATURES OF THE CHILEAN ACTIVITIES.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND 
OUTLOOK

During the XXXII Chilean Scientific Commission (February/March 1978) 
three DCPs were installed in the vicinity of the Chilean Antarctic Bases: 
Frei and O'Higgins ARMC.  These DCPs measure meteorological parameters 
such as wind velocity and direction, air temperature, snow temperature, 
air humidity, solar radiation, and atmospheric pressure.  Originally, 
the three DCPs sent to the LANDSAT satellite data corresponding to 
hourly readings of the sensors, and they transmitted them every 30 
seconds.  Experience taught us that such frequent readings were not 
necessary and the satellite often could not relay all the data.  Moreover, 
that procedure increased battery power consumption.  Therefore, during 
the scientific season 1978/1979 (XXXIII Commission, January/February 1979) 
the program was modified so that one of the Frei ARMC DCPs and the 
O'Higgins Base DCPs would read the sensors every four hours and send a 
group of data every 90 seconds.  The other Frei ARMC DCPs had been 
modified in December 1978 and it is now working with the GOES satellite, 
reading data every 15 minutes, storing them, and transmitting them every 
three hours.  These data are received by NOAA in the United States and 
mailed to Chile through the U.S. Geological Survey.

A metal structure with a watertight thermal box has been used to 
house the various components.  It contains the transmitting equipment, 
the batteries, and the electronic interfaces of the senors.  Moreover, 
the structure has masts that hold the sensors, the solar panels, and 
the antenna.  The general plan of the installation is shown in Figure No. 8.

The tower, made up of aluminum segments bolted together, was designed 
to be installed on any type of terrain (rock, gravel, ice) and to be 
assembled quickly.  Photographs 1 to 6 show some details of the Frei ARMC 
and the O'Higgins Base installations.  Photograph No. 2 makes it possible 
to compare the LANDSAT and GOES antennas.  Figure No. 9 shows the location 
of the first four DCPs installed by Chile on the Antarctic Peninsula.

In January and February 1979 a major step was taken toward the 
establishment of the DCPs network planned by Chile, consisting of the 
installation of a fourth DCP  on the Wedell seacoast at a remote site 
isolated from any human presence during the entire year.  In order to
- 7 -

accomplish this, the Antarctic Peninsula was crossed starting from
General Bernardo O'Higgins Base and using caterpillar tractors.  The
distance traveled was about 100 km., but the Peninsula had to be crossed
three times.  Thus a total distance of over 500 km. of dangerously
fissured ice was covered under unpredictable cloud coverage and wind
conditions.  Photographs 7 to 11 show some of the highlights of this
difficult expedition which demonstrated the feasibility of installing and
operating DCPs in remote and isolated sites.  Photographs 12 and 13 show
details of the installed tower with the new 20-watt solar panels.  This
new DCP measures the following parameters:  wind velocity and direction,
air temperature and humidity, and incident, reflected and net solar
radiation.  Its sensors are read every six hours and are subsequently
relayed to Santiago every 12 hours via satellite.

6.  THE CHIEF FINDINGS OF THE CHILEAN ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:

      (a) The metal structure consisting of aluminum segments bolted together
that is used to house the various electronic components has been found to be
very useful and its design has been found very appropriate for Antarctic
conditions.

      (b) The 20-watt solar panels yield better results than the 3.5-watt
panels initially used.  A system of five 12-volt batteries of 20 AH
capacity each and two 20-watt solar panels provide adequate enerty supply
for a DCP for a one-year period.  An alternative worth trying is using
wind generators combined with solar panels.

      (c) When using the LANDSAT satellite it is advisable to read sensors
at intervals of 3 hours or more in order to minimize power consumption and
to ensure relay of all the groups of data obtained during the satellite
transmission cycle.

      (d) DCPs operation in the GOES mode, with sensors read every 15
minutes and data transmission every three hours, results in slightly
decreased power consumption as compared with operation in the LANDSAT
mode.  However, this difference may be absorbed by the batteries, solar
panels and generators.

      (e) From 80 to 90 percent of the DCPs messages are relayed accurately
by the LANDSAT satellite.

      (f) The rate of accurate relay by the GOES satellite is in the order
of 80 percent, which is approximately the same as the results obtained in
continental zones at lower latitudes.  The higher data relay capacity of
the GOES satellite, as compared to the capacity shown by polar-orbit
satellites, should also be noted.

      (g) Sensors should be resistant to the severe environmental conditions
prevalent.  The STRATWANE type sensor has given the best results in
measuring wind velocity and direction.
- 8 -

(h) Some of the problems that have arisen because of unreliable readings yielded by some sensors will be corrected in the future by improving calibration and observing the warm-up period strictly (some sensors must be energized some 5 to 10 minutes before readings, which, of course, increases power consumption.

7.  CONCLUSIONS

(a) In view of the successful preliminary results achieved it is possible to consider the possibility of establishing a network of fixed and mobile DCPs on the Antarctic Peninsula.

(b) Satellite Data Collection Systems are an excellent alternative to the problem of collecting environmental data from remote sites in Antarctica.

(c) This system may be expanded throughout Antarctica to form a Global Antarctic Environmental Observation System using man-made satellites.
