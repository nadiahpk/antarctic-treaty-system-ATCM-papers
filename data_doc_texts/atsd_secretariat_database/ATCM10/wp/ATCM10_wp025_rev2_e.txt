September 26, 1979        
ORIGINAL:  English        

COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA        
(Recommendation submitted by the Working        
Group on this Agenda Item to Plenary)        

The Representatives,        

Recalling Recommendations VI-1, VI-3, and VII-7;        

Noting that the Third Antarctic Treaty Telecommunications Meeting        
held in Washington in September 1978 had described the telecommunica-        
tions network for the exchange of meteorological data both within the        
Antarctic and between the Antarctic and Global Telecommunications        
System (GTS) of the World Weather Watch (WWW) as it existed in Sep-        
tember 1978 (see Annex);        

Taking account of the importance of Antarctic meteorological data        
to the WWW and the diminished value of such data if it is not avail-        
able to users within and outside the Antarctic in accordance with        
WMO schedules for the receipt of raw and processed data;        

Reaffirming the importance of the GTS for purposes of transmitting        
Antarctic meteorological data between Antarctic stations in cases        
where direct transmission within Antarctica is inhibited by ionos-        
pheric conditions;        

Noting, with appreciation, SCAR's response to Recommendation IX-3 and        
the improvement in Antarctic telecommunications that would follow if        
operators and offices administering Antarctic programs had available        
to them statements of the current telecommunications practices within        
and between national networks;        

Recognizing that changing national requirements for Antarctic tele-        
communications, changing technology or budgetary constraints may lead        
to significant incompatibilities arising between national networks;

Recognizing that possible future trans-polar commercial air traffic 
and the steadily increasing amount of shipping in the Antarctic region 
may give rise to a changing pattern of needs for raw and processed 
meteorological data;

Affirming that developments in the collection and distribution of 
meteorological data should be reviewed from time to time;

Recommend to their governments that:

1. Taking account of the final report of the Third Antarctic Treaty 
Meeting on Telecommunications, they should strive to improve the 
system for the collection and distribution of Antarctic meteorologi-
cal data having regard particularly to increasing efficiency, re-
liability and economy of effort; taking into account opportunities 
offered by new technology;

2. Each station undertaking meteorological observations should 
ensure that data are transmitted as soon as practicable 
after the observation;

3. Stations receiving these data for onward transmission to 
other Antarctic stations or to the GTS should forward such 
data with minimum delay;

4. In cooperation with other Antarctic stations and World Meteor-
ological Centers, they continue regularly to monitor receipt 
of Antarctic data by, and its transmission within, the GTS;

5. In cooperation with the WWW, they seek to ensure that the 
transmission of these data from the GTS to Antarctic stations 
is facilitated in cases where this method is likely to be 
more reliable or cost-effective than trans-Antarctic trans-
missions;

6. Through their National Antarctic Committees, they invite SCAR 
to prepare a brief handbook of the telecommunications 
practices within and between national networks in a format 
which allows it to be periodically amended in the light of 
changes in national practices;

7. For the purposes of the previous paragraph, they ensure that 
their offices administering Antarctic programs inform SCAR 
in June and December each year of changes in their telecommunica-
tions practices;

8. Subject to overriding scientific, administrative or budgetary 
reasons, they seek to ensure, by means of appropriate contacts 
with the offices administering Antarctic programs, that trans-
mission of meteorological data between Antarctic stations is 
not prejudiced by changes in their telecommunications practices;

9. They invite the World Meteorological Organization, through 
their Permanent Representatives, to review Annexes 1 
and 2 of Recommendation VI-3 with a view to advising 
Consultative Parties about current, and probable 
future, requirements for both raw and processed data 
in the Antarctic region;

10. Not later than at the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty Consulta-
tive Meeting they review developments in Antarctic 
telecommunications for meteorological purposes, having 
sought in the interim period to resolve any international 
difficulties that may arise with regard to the system by 
appropriate bilateral discussion.
