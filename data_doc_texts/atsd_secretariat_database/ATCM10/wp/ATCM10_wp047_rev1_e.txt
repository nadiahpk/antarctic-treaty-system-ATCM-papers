REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON
THE QUESTION OF ANTARCTIC MINERAL RESOURCES
LEGAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS

1. The Meeting of the Working Group on the Question of Antarctic Mineral
Resource Issues: Legal and Political Aspects met between 21 September and
October 4, 1979.

2. The Chairman of the Working Group was Norman A. Wulf (United States).

3. The discussion was informal and in large part reflected the preliminary views
of the individual representatives.

4. The discussions demonstrated the continuing validity of the four principles
identified in the Report of the Paris Special Preparatory Meeting and endorsed
in paragraph 4 of Recommendation IX-1 as follows:

    (i) the Consultative Parties will continue to play an active and
responsible role in dealing with the question of the mineral
resources of Antarctica;

    (ii) the Antarctic Treaty must be maintained in its entirety;

    (iii) protection of the unique Antarctic environment and of its dependent
ecosystems should be a basic consideration;

    (iv) the Consultative Parties, in dealing with the question of mineral
resources in Antarctica, should not prejudice the interests of
all mankind in Antarctica.

5. In this connection, representatives were mindful of developments likely to
result from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.

6. The discussion of the various elements to be included in a regime were
wide-ranging. The representatives noted the regime to be created should
be consistent with the principles and purposes of the Antarctic Treaty and
the system created under that Treaty including the objective that Antarctica
not become the scene or object of international discord.

7. Protection of the unique Antarctic environment was a major concern of
the Working Group. In this connection, the Working Group noted the parti-
cular importance of scientific aspects being dealt with by the Working
Group on the Question of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation: Scientific
and Environmental Aspects.

8. There was an exchange of views on the differing positions on sovereignty
in Antarctica. While these differences are fundamental, all participants
believed that accommodation of these differences could be found, considering
the positive experience of nearly two decades under the Antarctic Treaty.
All believed that an accommodation on mineral resource issues should be
in keeping with this spirit and should not alter the provisions of Article
IV of the Antarctic Treaty.

9. There was general agreement that the Consultative Parties should acceler-
ate their efforts to establish jointly a regime for Antarctic mineral
resources.

10. Based on these discussions, the Working Group prepared a draft Recom-
mendation which is annexed to this report.
