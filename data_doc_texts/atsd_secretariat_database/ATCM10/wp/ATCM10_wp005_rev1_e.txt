FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COLLECTION OF
GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS

(Draft Recommendation Submitted by New Zealand, United States,
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and United Kingdom Delegations)

The Representatives,

Recalling Article III of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recognising that an essential element in geological investigations is 
the collection and removal of specimens but that the removal of 
specimens from areas of exceptional geological interest needs, as far 
as is practicable, to be kept to a minimum in order to avoid prejudicing 
subsequent geological investigations in such areas;

Noting that this problem is presented in a more acute form in areas 
where more than one expedition is undertaking geological investiga-
tions;

Noting that this problem has already been recognized with regard to 
the collection of meteorites;

Noting that it might be appropriate to designate as Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest, small areas which were of exceptional scientific 
interest;

Recommend to their governments that, through their National Committees,
they refer the matter to SCAR for further study.
