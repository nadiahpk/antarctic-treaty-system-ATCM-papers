FACILITATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH:
SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
INTERIM GUIDELINES

(Submitted by the Delegation of Poland)

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VII-3, VIII-3 and VIII-4;

Noting that a management plan has been prepared for a Site of Special
Interest on the western shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island;

Considering that it would be advantageous to gather experience of the practical
effect of the management plan prepared for this Site;

Recommend to their Governments that they voluntarily take account of the
annexed management plan for Site No. 8: Admiralty Bay, King George
Island.

SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST No. 8
ADMIRALTY BAY, KING GEORGE ISLAND

MANAGEMENT PLAN

I.      Description of Site:

All that area on the western shore of Admiralty Bay, south of Ezcurra Inlet,
south of a line connecting Jardine Peak and the shoreline immediately to the
north of a prominent group of rocks characterized by a covering of orange
lichens bearing approximately 0680T from Jardine Peak, and east of a line
joining Jardine Peak, The Tower and a point on shore line bearing 1800T from
The Tower.

II.     Reason for Designation

This area is one of exceptionally scientific interest close to a research sta-
tion frequently visited by tourist ships.  It supports an exceptional assem-
blage of Antarctic birds and mammals.  Long-term research programmes could be
jeopardised by accidental interference, especially during the breeding season
of these animals.

III.    Outline of Research

The area supports a breeding colony of Elephant seals and three species of
pygoscelid penguins in association with eight species of flighted birds.  The
purpose of the investigations is to gain insight into the dynamics of a typi-
cal, but particularly rich, Antarctic coastal ecosystem. Studies of the func-
tioning of the inshore and coastal zone in relation to that ecosystem will
include quantitative studies of the circulation of matter and energy between
the coastal and marine environments.

IV.     Date of expiry of Designation:

March 31, 1985.

V.      Access Points:

The site should only be entered from the vicinity of Point Thomas.

VI.     Pedestrians and Vehicular Routes:

Vehicles should not enter the site. Pedestrians should not move through
the populated areas, especially during the breeding season, except as necessary
in the course of scientific investigations.

VII.    Other kind of Scientific Investigations which would not cause
harmful interference:

Scientific investigation which will not cause significant disturbance to the
biological programmes mentioned in section (III).

VIII.  Scientific Sampling;

Scientific sampling, other than that associated with the research programme described above, should be kept to a minimum.

IX.  Other Restraints:

Helicopters and low-flying aircraft should avoid the breeding colonies of birds in accordance with the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.
