PROPOSAL BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILE
CONCERNING MARINE SITES OF SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
IN CHILE BAY ON GREENWICH ISLAND (SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS)

Considering that at the VII Consultative Antarctic Meeting a recommendation
to the governments (VII-3) was adopted inviting SCAR, through their National
Committees, to consider and draft suggestions for the designation of sites
of Special Scientific Interest, along with a descriptive plan for each one;

Bearing in mind Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and the aforementioned
recommendation VII-3, the Eighth Meeting of-the Consultative Parties to
the Antarctic Treaty adopted recommendation VIII-3, proposing to their
governments that, until such time as the recommendations designating Sites
of Special Scientific interest became effective, in accordance with the
provisions of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, those Recommendations
should be considered as guidelines;

The Delegation of Chile at the X Consultative Meeting proposes the following
marine sites as of Special Scientific Interest, for which it requests the
approval of the Representatives of said Consultative Parties:

The present proposal is referred to in the report of the Executive Committee
of SCAR on its meeting in Cambridge (United Kingdom) from June 26 to June 29,
1979, paragraph 4-a-1, "Chile Bay."

MARINE SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
CHILE BAY, GREENWICH ISLAND

MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. Description of Site

The site comprises two tracts of benthic habitat located as follows:

Benthic Habitat A:     Between 50 and 100 m depth and the following
                       coordinates:

                       Lat. S: 62°28,9'       Long. W: 59°41'12"
                       Lat. S: 62°29,3'       Long. W: 59°41'43"

Includes Stas. 32 and 39 of the Chilean Antarctic Institute benthic
community study.

Benthic Habitat B:     Between 100 and 200 m depth and the following
                       coordinates:

                       Lat. S: 62°28,3'       Long. W: 59°40'15"
                       Lat. S: 62°28,7'       Long. W: 59°40'47"

Includes Stas. 49 and 50 of the Chilean Antarctic Institute benthic
community study.

2. Reason for Designation

In Chile Bay there has been continued quantitative and qualitative
benthic research since 1967.  Data being accumulated provides a
baseline for long-term investigations.  The site is of exceptional
scientific interest and therefore requires a long-term protection
from possible harmful interference.

3. Outline of Research

A long-term research programme has started in 1967 in connection
with the benthic fauna reestablishment study of Foster Port,
Deception Island following volcanic eruptions of December 1967.
Chile Bay has been designated as control study area.  These
studies are performed yearly during the summer.  The community
criterion to observe biota changes will be implemented with other
acceptable criteria in order to comply with requisites of a long-
term biological monitoring program.

4. Date of Expiry of Designation

March, 1983.

5. Access Points

Not applicable.

6. Pedestrian and Vehicular Routes

Not applicable.

7. Other Kinds of Scientific Investigations which would not cause
Harmful Interference

Scientific research other than benthic.

8. Scientific Sampling

Samples from the benthic habitats should only be taken for compelling
scientific purposes.

9. Other Restraints

Marine pollution from ships, bottom trawling or siting of bottom
devices should be avoided. Anchoring should be performed under
compelling circumstances only.
