COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA

(Draft Recommendation submitted by the Drafting Committee to the Working
Group on this Agenda Item)

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VI-1, VI-3, and VII-7;

Noting that the Third Antarctic Treaty Telecommunications Meeting held
in Washington in September 1978 had defined the telecommunications
network for the exchange of meteorological data both within the
Antarctic and between the Antarctic and the Global Telecommunications
System (GTS) of the World Weather Watch (WWW) as it existed in
September 1978 (see Annex);

Reaffirming the importance of Antarctic meteorological data to the WWW
and the diminished value of such data if it is not available to users
within and outside the Antarctic in accordance with WMO schedules for
the receipt of raw and processed data;

Reaffirming the importance of the GTS for purposes of transmitting
Antarctic meteorological data between Antarctic stations in cases
where direct transmission is inhibited by ionospheric conditions;

Noting, with appreciation, SCAR's response to Recommendation IX-3 and
the improvement in Antarctic telecommunications that would follow if
operators and offices administering Antarctic programs had available
to them statements of the current telecommunications practices within
and between national networks;

Recognizing that changing national requirements for Antarctic tele-
communications, changing technology or budgetary constraints may lead
to significant incompatibilities arising between national networks;

Recognizing that possible future trans-polar commercial air traffic
and the steadily increasing amount of shipping in the Antarctic
region may give rise to a changing pattern of needs for raw and
processed meteorological data;

Affirming    that developments in the collection and distribution of
meteorological data should be reviewed from time to time;

Recommend to their governments that:

1. They should strive to improve the system for the collection
and distribution of Antarctic meteorological data having
regard particularly to increasing efficiency, reliability
and economy of effort;

2. Each station undertaking meteorological observations should
ensure that data are transmitted as soon as practicable
after the observation hour;

3. Stations receiving these data for onward transmission to
other Antarctic stations or to the GTS should forward such
data with minimum delay;

4. In cooperation with World Meteorological Centers, they con-
tinue regularly to monitor receipt of Antarctic data by,
and its transmission within, the GTS;

5. In cooperation with the WWW, they seek to ensure that the
transmission of these data from the GTS to Antarctic stations
is facilitated in cases where this method is likely to be
more reliable or cost-effective than trans-Antarctic trans-
missions;

6. Through their National Antarctic Committees, they invite SCAR
to prepare a brief handbook of the telecommunications
practices within and between national networks in a format
which allows it to be periodically amended in the light of
changes in national practices;

7. For the purposes of the previous paragraph, they ensure that
their offices administering Antarctic programs inform SCAR
of changes in their telecommunications practices;

8. Subject to overriding scientific, administrative or budgetary
reasons, they seek to ensure, by means of appropriate contacts
with the offices administering Antarctic programs, that trans-
mission of meteorological data between Antarctic stations is
not prejudiced by changes in their telecommunications practices;

9. Invite the World Meteorological Organization, through 
their Permanent Representatives, to review Annexes 1 
and 2 of Recommendation VI-3 with a view to advising 
Consultative Parties about current, and probable 
future, requirements for both raw and processed data 
in the Antarctic region;

10. Not later than at the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty Consulta-
tive Meeting they review developments in Antarctic 
telecommunications for meteorological purposes, having 
sought in the interim period to resolve any international 
difficulties that may arise with regard to the system by 
appropriate bilateral discussion.
