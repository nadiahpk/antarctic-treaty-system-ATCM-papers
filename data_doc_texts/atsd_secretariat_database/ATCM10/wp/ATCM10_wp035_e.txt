DOCUMENTS OF THE CONSULTATIVE MEETING				
(Working Paper Submitted				
by the United States Delegation)				


Public interest in Antarctica has grown, and continues to grow, stimulated				
by concern for the Antarctic environment and questions relating to possible				
resource activity.  Governments outside the Antarctic Treaty system are evi-				
dencing increasing interest in the activities of the Consultative Parties, par-				
ticularly during the regular Consultative Meetings held under the Treaty.  There				
is relatively little information publicly available regarding these activities,				
and in its absence, suspicion and misinterpretation may occur.				

The need for greater efforts to make available information and documents of				
Consultative Meetings was recognized in the Report of the Ninth Consultative				
Meeting.  In the view of the United States Delegation, the Consultative Parties				
should continue to seek means of making information regarding their activities				
accessible to the interested public.. It is also recognized that increased				
efforts in this regard will have to be balanced against the need for appropriate				
level of confidentiality within Consultative Meetings in order to ensure continu-				
ation of the open exchange of views in these Meetings.				

Therefore, the United States Delegation believes that the Consultative				
Parties should consider the following:				

--  The final reports of Consultative Meetings should include more complete				
accounts of the Plenary and working group activities during the meetings.				

--  Any Consultative Party may make available to the public documents of				
Consultative Meetings, except for documents identified as not subject to release				
by:				

1)  the originating Government;				

2)  the Chairman of the Consultative Meeting; or				

3)  the consensus of participants in the Consultative Meeting.
