OIL CONTAMINATION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT

(Draft Recommendation submitted by the Drafting Committee
to the Working Group on this Agenda Item)

The Representatives,

Recalling that Recommendation IX-6, operative paragraph 4, called for such
reports as might have been prepared on the matters set out in the first
three operative paragraphs to be further considered at the Meeting of
Experts recommended in paragraph 3 of Recommendation IX-1;

Noting that three reports had been submitted to that meeting, (Washington,
June 1979) which, between them:

     (i) adequately described the pathways by which oil may
         reach the Antarctic marine environment;

    (ii) concentrated on the question of baseline measurements
         of the hydrocarbon content of the Antarctic marine
         environment and programmes for further study of this
         question;

   (iii) devoted less attention to proposals relating to
         practicable means by which oil contamination of the
         Antarctic marine environment might be reduced;

Recognizing that methods for analysing dissolved hydrocarbons have not yet
reached the stage where they can be used on a routine basis and that the
results of such measurements have given rise to differing interpretations
as to their environmental significance especially regarding very low
levels of hydrocarbon content in water samples from the open ocean;
ANT/X/40 (Rev. 1)                        - 2 -

Recognizing that determination of baseline measurements of the hydrocarbon
content in representative components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem
(including birds and mammals) would probably, in the medium term, provide
a more cost-effective insight into levels of oil contamination of the
Antarctic marine environment;

Noting that up to now the most significant introduction of oil in the
Antarctic marine environment has appeared to be from the operation of
ships and that there are international agreements aimed at reducing
the levels of oil contamination of the marine environment generally;

Recognising that the Antarctic is especially hazardous for the operation
of ships; and

Noting that in most instances it is not possible to adapt existing ships
to more stringent standards for the prevention of the contamination of
the sea by oil;

Recommend to their Governments that they take note of Section III of the
Report of Ecological, Technological, and other Related Experts on
Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica (Washington, 1979),
annexed to Recommendation X.

I

Baseline Levels of Contamination

1. While co-ordinating programmes through their National Committees and
SCAR, they encourage studies of:

    (a) baseline measurements of hydrocarbon content in representative
        components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem (including birds
        and mammals);

    (b) the effects of various kinds and concentrations of hydrocarbons
        (and other pollutants) on key components of the Antarctic
        marine ecosystem;

    (c) the methodology of analysing low levels of dissolved hydrocarbon
        content of the marine environment and its development for
        purposes of routine measurements;

2. Through their National Antarctic Committees, they invite SCAR in
consultation with other competent international organizations,
to keep under review the possibility of developing a programme
for the determination of baseline measurements of hydrocarbon
content relevant to the needs for such determinations in the
Antarctic marine environment.

II

Reduction of Contamination

1. They review their respective obligations under existing international 
agreements to which they are parties relating to the reduction of 
contamination of the sea by oil and, in the light of the particularly 
hazardous nature of the Antarctic for ship operations, consider 
whether their compliance with these obligations adequately minimizes 
the risk of oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment;

2. They be prepared to discuss this matter further at the Eleventh 
Consultative Meeting.
