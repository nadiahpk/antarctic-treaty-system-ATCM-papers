PETROLEUM CONTAMINATION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT
    BY BALLAST WATER FROM TANKERS

SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILI

Introduction

Ballast water from tankers has been a major source of seawater contamination
in subantarctic regions, as is the case in the far south of the Strait of
Magellan. In this area the contaminating residues of petroleum contained
in ballast water drift to the coasts, where they form deposits of the con-
sistency of creamy jelly. Due to evaporation of the light hydrocarbons,
the deposits become covered with a thin film which preserves the remaining
inner material and delays degradation by many years. Some researchers are
of the opinion that the jelly-like material inside these small deposits
is more toxic than the original petroleum. This material has lasted over
twenty years, and the biological impact may be greater than was estimated
in certain environments. In the Antarctic the consequences would be more
serious.

The use of demulsifiers in the ballast water to separate the petroleum re-
duces petroleum contamination but does not totally eliminate it. Moreover,
the addition of chemicals to the ballast water leads to further contamination
with effects on the Antarctic marine environment that are unknown and should
be studied before intensive use of demulsifiers is approved. The amount of
ballast water carried by the large tankers would be considerable (100 thousand
to 200 thousand tons), and although only a small percentage of its content
may be petroleum, after several years of operation the contamination might
have a substantial biological impact.

The representatives,

Aware of the dangers of petroleum contamination caused by deballasting
tankers in Antarctica,
ANT/X/29

                                  - 2 -

Convinced that it is necessary to prevent the damage which this petroleum-
contaminated ballast water causes in the Antarctic marine environment,

Wishing to adopt within the context of the Antarctic Treaty uniform rules
and procedures for settling any question of responsibility and for pre-
serving the Antarctic marine environment from contaminants,

Recalling recommendation IX-6, paragraph 2 of the IX Consultative Meeting,

Recommend that its Governments consider:

1.  The adoption of safety measures for tankers operating under
    Antarctic conditions in accordance with the International
    Agreement to prevent hydrocarbon contamination of seawater.

2.  The adoption of special sites for discharging ballast water
    with petroleum residues from tankers.
