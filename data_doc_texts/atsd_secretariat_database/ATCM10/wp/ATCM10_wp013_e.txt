PRIVATE EXPEDITIONS

(Draft recommendation originally submitted by the United Kingdom
at the Ninth Consultative Meeting)

The Representatives,

Reaffirming the traditional Antarctic principle that expeditions
render all assistance feasible in the event of an emergency request
for help, as stated in Recommendation I - X,

Noting that private expeditions may also give rise to a need for
rescue operations and that as a result scientific stations may incur
expenditure and diversion of resources,

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.  They supply on request all available information
about a private expedition to the Treaty area of
which they have knowledge;

2.  They urge all private expeditions to carry adequate
insurance cover against the risk of their incurring
financial charges or material losses in the Treaty
area.
