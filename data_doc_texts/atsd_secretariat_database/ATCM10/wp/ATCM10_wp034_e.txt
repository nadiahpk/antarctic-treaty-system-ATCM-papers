ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION      ORIGINAL: English
AND EXPLOITATION

(Draft Recommendation Submitted By The Delegation of Poland

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation IX-1,

Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Antarctic Treaty,

Acknowledging that the Antarctic Treaty places a special responsibility upon
the Contracting Parties to protect the unique nature of the Antarctic,

Concerned that mineral resource exploration and exploitation could adversely
affect the Antarctic ecosystem;

Recognizing the need for comprehensive strategy of protection of major ecologi-
cal elements of Antarctic fauna;

Noting that:

1.  Any decision concerning future exploitation of mineral resources in the
Antarctic is impossible without taking into account the comprehensive knowledge
of abiotic and biotic environment;

2.  Means should be taken to further develop integration of biological, geo-
logical and geophysical data with a view of obtaining a common strategy of
protection of Antarctic nature;

3.  Elaboration of such common strategy requires a better knowledge of location
and distribution of mineral and biological resources in order to avoid the
adverse effect of future exploitation on main breeding - and - feeding grounds
of Antarctic fauna and on floral habitats;
ANT/X/34

- 2 -

Recommend their Governments to invite SCAR through their National Antarctic
Committees to:

1.  Set up a permanent advisory body with the purpose of integrating data
concerning the location of mineral deposits and the location and stability of
main floral habitats as well as breeding - and - feeding grounds of Antarctic
fauna in order to exclude ecologically sensitive areas from future exploitation
of mineral resources;

2.  To elaborate corresponding precedures concerning preparation of environ-
mental impact assessments by group of SCAR specialists prior to taking any
decision concerning possible advanced exploration or exploitation of mineral
resources, should such be permitted, on the Treaty Area.
