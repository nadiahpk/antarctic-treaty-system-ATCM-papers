DRAFT PAPER

(Submitted by the Delegation of New Zealand)
DRAFT PAPER                                  ANT/X/5

In recent years many New Zealand earth scientists have
expressed their growing concern at the large scale removal of
important geological material from some areas adjacent to the
Ross Sea, particularly the dry valleys of Victoria Land.

Some areas once known to contain considerable quantities
of interesting and important material such as agate and quartz
geodes, solicified wood and fossiliferous rock are now almost
bare of these materials.

Concern has also been expressed at the more recent whole-
sale collection and removal from Antarctica of all meteorites
found.

Both scientists and non-scientists have been active in this
large-scale collection of specimen material and souvenir taking.

This Delegation submits the following Recommendation for
consideration:

The Representatives,

Recalling     Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and
              Recommendations VII - 3, VIII - 3 and VIII - 13;

Recognising   the impracticability of designating large areas
              of Antarctica as Sites of Special Scientific
              Interest;

Desiring      to minimise the impact of Man on the Antarctic
              environment;

Conscious     of the need to retain examples of geological
              interest "in situ" for future scientific study;

Recommend    to their Governments that:

1.  They bring to the attention of their offices administering
    Antarctic programmes the need for controlling the
    indiscriminate collection by non-scientists of
    geological material for souvenirs.

2.  They invite SCAR through their National Committees to
    consider this matter further and to bring the attention
    of scientific parties to the need for restraint in the
    amount of geological specimens removed from any one
    area of Antarctica.
