COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL DATA

Report by the Chairman of the Working Group
to the Chairman of the Meeting

The Working Group on Telecommunications was established on Tuesday, September
18 under the Chairmanship of R. B. Thomson of New Zealand. It completed its
work and adjourned permanently on September 21, 1979.

Seven documents were tabled and discussed:

ANT/X/2   - Report of the Third ATM on Telecommunications
ANT/X/3   - SCAR's response to Recommendation IX-3
ANT/X/6   - Submitted by Argentina
ANT/X/7   - Submitted by Chile
ANT/X/10  - Submitted by Chile
ANT/X/11  - Submitted by USSR
ANT/X/BP/3- Submitted by the Chairman

The Group commenced its work with an exchange of views in an attempt to
identify the problems associated with telecommunications in the Antarctic.
Although "areas of concern" were referred to by some delegations, a "real
problem" did not emerge.

The Group noted that the report from the Third Antarctic Treaty Meeting on
Telecommunications did not contain any specific recommendations to the Tenth
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, therefore this was not helpful to the
Group in its attempt to identify the real problems associated with telecom-
munications.

The "areas of concern" the Group identified included:

(a) The need for increasing the rate of flow of meteorological
data to data centres.

(b) Making available weather information for use as a basis 
for operational needs, including the likely increasing 
requirements of commercial ship and aircraft operators.

(c) Improving the means for exchanging data between West and East 
Antarctica.

(d) Compatability of equipment.

(e) The desirability of continuing the updating and the 
exchange of information regarding current telecommuni-
cation practices.

During the final session the Chairman asked each Delegation to indicate 
if they had a specific problem with telecommunications. None were stated 
and areas of concern only were referred to in keeping with the earlier 
discussions.

A drafting group headed by Dr. John Heap (UK) was appointed to produce a 
draft document to reflect the views of the Group and to also take into account 
the Report of the Third Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Telecommunications 
and SCAR's response to Recommendation IX-3.

The Group finally gave its approval to Document ANT/X/25 (Rev. 1).
