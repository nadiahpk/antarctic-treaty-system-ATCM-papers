RECOMMENDATION X - IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ANTARCTICA
SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF THE UNION
OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

1.-  the necessity of improving telecommunications in Antarctica to ensure the
need for exchanging administrative, scientific, meteorological and
operational information;

2.-  the necessity of improving the collection of meteorological data in the
Antarctic Treaty area and of feeding these data in the agreed volume,
with minimal delay, into the Global System of Telecommunications of the
World Meteorological Organization;

3.-  the growing need for meteorological information to ensure the safety of
navigation, air-traffic, and expeditionary operations, both in Antarctica
and beyond;

4.-  that the telecommunications experts of the member countries of the
Antarctic Treaty have discussed at the Third Meeting (September 1978,
Washington, DC.) the status of telecommunications in Antarctica and
have worked out a detailed plan of the existing telecommunications
network;

NOTING, THAT:

1.-  the expansion of scientific research and practical operations in Antarctica
increases the flow of information;

2.-  within the last years, there have occurred serious changes, both in the
organization of Antarctic telecommunications and in the equipping the
stations and Centers with various telecommunications and devices and apparatus;

3.-  these changes do not fully satisfy the requirements of improving tele-
communications in Antarctica;
ANT/X/11                  - 2 -

4.- reducing the number of communications links on certain radiolines, in com-
parison with those recommended by the 6th Consultative Meeting limits for
the Antarctic stations the effective reception of meteorological informa-
tion; drawing attention to the fact: that there exists a permanent need
for the coordination of operational and technical procedures and
practices as applied in the Antarctic stations and Centers when
establishing telecommunications between such stations and the Centers;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS THAT:

1.- They approve the activities of the Antarctic telecommunications experts
from the member countries of the Antarctic Treaty (September 1978,
Washington, DC)

2.- They take steps to implement and improve the Antarctic telecommunications
and meteorological data exchange plan as developed by the telecommunica-
tions experts at the 3rd Meeting

3.- In planning their Antarctic expeditions they provide for organizational
and technical measures to improve and develop the telecommunications as
rapidly and fully as practically feasible.

4.- They incorporate changes in the plan and the system of Antarctic tele-
communications in case such need for such changes should arise and
provided the parties concerned agree on it.
