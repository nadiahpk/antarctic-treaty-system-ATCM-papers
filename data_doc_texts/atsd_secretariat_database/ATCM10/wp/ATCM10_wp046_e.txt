DRAFT RECOMMENDATION TO PLENARY
SUBMITTED BY THE WORKING GROUP ON THE QUESTION OF
MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION:  SCIENTIFIC
AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

The Representatives:

Recognizing that there is a need for additional scientific data on the
Antarctic environment to facilitate the prediction of possible impacts
arising from many of the mineral resource exploration and exploitation
activities in the Antarctic, should such occur;

Aware also of the necessity to obtain additional scientific information
with a view to facilitating the development of measures related to the
protection of the Antarctic environment from possible harmful impacts of
mineral resource exploration and exploitation, should such activities
occur;

Recalling that Recommendation IX-1, operative paragraph 3, called for a
meeting of ecological, technological, and other related experts with a
view to developing scientific programs aimed at improving predictions of
the impact of possible technologies for mineral exploration and exploita-
tion in the Antarctic, and developing measures for the prevention of
damage to the environment or for its rehabilitation;

Noting that such a meeting was held in Washington, D.C., June 25 - 29, 1979,
as part of the Preparatory Meeting to the Tenth Consultative Meeting;

Recommend to their Governments that:

A.  Taking account of the Report of Ecological, Technological, and Other
Related Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica
(Washington, June 1979), attached as an annex to the Report of the
ANT/X/46

- 2 -

Tenth Consultative Meeting, they facilitate their research activities 
which would contribute to an improved understanding of relevant aspects 
of the Antarctic and its environment.

B.  With a view to improving predictions of the environmental impacts of 
activities, events, and technologies associated with mineral resource 
exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic should such occur, they, 
through their National Antarctic Committees, encourage SCAR to define 
programs, taking account of the Experts Report (Washington, June 1979), 
with the objectives of:

a.  retrieving and analyzing relevant information from past 
observations and research programs;

b.  ensuring in relation to the needs for information 
identified by the Experts Report that effective 
use is made of existing programs;

c.  identifying and developing new programs that should 
have priority, taking account of the length of time 
required for results to become available.

C.  Insofar as is feasible they support, as appropriate, their National 
Antarctic Committees and their offices administering their Antarctic 
research programs in developments arising from the previous paragraph.
