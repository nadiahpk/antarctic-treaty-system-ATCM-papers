IMPROVEMENT OF ANTARCTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OF THE COLLECTION
AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA

Draft Recommendation

(Submitted by the Delegation of Chile)

The Representatives:

Considering that:

The member nations of the Antarctic Treaty, motivated by a natural wish to
maintain permanent links in order to meet their requirements, have been develop-
ing systems and implementing means, in accordance with their own requests;

Such major technical, scientific, human, and economic efforts have been de-
ployed without being coordinated with the entire Antarctic telecommunications
system, causing:

- Duplication of efforts;

- Occasional confusion in traffic with respect to the origin of
the information;

- Flooding and disorder in transmission schedules and in the use
of the available frequencies;

Sea, land, and air traffic in Antarctica is becoming increasingly steady
and intense, as a result of a marked increase in scientific and touristic
activities;

Such traffic makes it imperative to have available ever more prompt and
reliable means of collecting and distributing meteorological information;

Recalling that:

At the Second Meeting of Antarctic Telecommunications Experts, held in 
Buenos Aires in 1969, the required system was set up for carrying out administra-
tive, operational, and scientific activities in Antarctica with respect to the 
collection and distribution of meteorological data;

Recommend to their Governments:

1. That the system agreed upon at the Second Meeting of Antarctic Tele-
communications Experts (Buenos Aires, 1969) be expedited.

2. That the telecommunications infrastructure be developed both with the 
other members and with the World Meteorological Office in order to 
avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts in this area.

3. That the use of frequencies, schedules, broadcasts, and information 
flow be rearranged by readjusting the current procedures through a 
general agreement by the Parties.

4. That automatic systems for collecting and distributing environmental 
data be developed by using man-made satellites and remote sensors 
and establishing a network throughout the entire territory with 
appropriate means for handling the type and volume of information to 
be processed at a given point in accordance with a previously agreed 
comprehensive system.
