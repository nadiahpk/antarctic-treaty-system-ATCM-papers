PETROLEUM POLLUTION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT

Report to be included in the final report
of the Consultative Meeting.
(Drafted by the Chairman of the Working Group)

The Working Group appointed to study Item 9 on the Agenda met in three working 
sessions under the Chairmanship of Mr. J.P. Broch.

The work was organized in accordance with the various paragraphs of 
Recommendation IX. 6.

First it examined Part III of the report by the group of experts on ecological, 
technical, and related matters concerning mineral resource prospecting and 
exploitation in Antarctica, taking into account the three reports which 
were submitted during the meeting held in Washington in June, 1979.  These 
reports dealt with the problems of pollution of Antarctic waters.

Next it noted the information provided by the Delegation of Chile on the 
observations made after the Metula ran aground in the Straits of Magellan.

After examining matters related to measuring the hydrocarbon content of 
seawater, it was interested in the problem of preventing risks of pollution 
by ships, which in its opinion was the main source of such pollution.
