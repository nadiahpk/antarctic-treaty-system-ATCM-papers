DRAFT PARAGRAPHS FOR INCLUSION IN A RECOMMENDATION ON THE
QUESTION OF MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION
SUBMITTED BY THE WORKING GROUP ON THE QUESTION OF
MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION:  SCIENTIFIC
AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS      

The Representatives,        

Recalling that Recommendation IX-1, operative paragraph 3, called for a meeting
of ecological, technological, and other related experts with a view to
developing scientific programs aimed at improving predictions of the impact of
possible technologies for mineral exploration and exploitation in the
Antarctic, and developing measures for the prevention of damage to the environ-
ment or for its rehabilitation;        

Noting that such a meeting was held in Washington, D.C., as part of the Tenth
Preparatory Meeting;        

Recommend to their Governments that:        

A.  Taking account of the Report of Ecological, Technological, and Other
    Related Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica
    (Washington, June 1979), attached as an annex to the Report of the
    Tenth Consultative Meeting, they facilitate their research activities
    which would contribute to an improved understanding of relevant
    aspects of the Antarctic and its environment.        

B.  With a view to improving predictions of the environmental impacts of
    activities, events, and technologies associated with mineral resource
    exploration and exploitation in the Antarctic should such occur, they,
    through their National Antarctic Committees, encourage SCAR to define
    programs, taking account of the Experts Report (Washington, June 1979),
    with the objectives of:        

    a.  retrieving and analyzing relevant information from past
        observations and research programs;
ANT/X/36 (Rev. 1)                                  - 2 -

b. ensuring in relation to the needs for information 
identified by the Experts Report that effective 
use is made of existing programs;

c. identifying and developing new programs that should 
have priority, taking account of the length of time 
required for results to become available.

C. Insofar as is feasible they support, as appropriate, their National 
Antarctic Committees and their offices administering their Antarctic 
research programs in developments arising from the previous paragraph.
