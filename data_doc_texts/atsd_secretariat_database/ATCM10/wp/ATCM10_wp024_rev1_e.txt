EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL
EXPEDITIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA
                                            
The Representatives,
                                            
Recalling that Annex A to Recommendation VIII-9 was to be discussed at the
Ninth Consultative Meeting and that a draft text of a Statement of Accepted
Practices and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty was referred
from the Ninth to the Tenth Consultative Meeting;
                                            
Recognising that adventurous individuals organizing private, non-commercial
expeditions to Antarctica may contact other Consultative Parties, asking
for help or advice, without first approaching the government of the Con-
sultative Party in whose territory the expedition is being organized;
                                            
Recognising, also, that in considering responses to requests for help
from such expeditions, an important concern is the possibility that such
expeditions may, in cases of emergency, involve the offices administering
their Antarctic programs in financial or material loss;
                                            
Recognising that suitably qualified guides accompanying commercially
organized Antarctic tours would both benefit the tourists and help to
ensure that the conservation and environmental measures adopted by the
Consultative Parties were observed;
                                            
While reaffirming the traditional Antarctic principle that expeditions
render all assistance feasible in the event of an emergency request for
help, noted that commercial overflights of Antarctica are operating in
a particularly hazardous environment, where aircraft operation systems
normally available elsewhere in the world are at a minimum, and where
emergencies could arise beyond the capacity of permanent Antarctic
expeditions to respond adequately;
ANT/X/24 (Rev. 1)

Recommend to their governments that:

I

STATEMENT OF ACCEPTED PRACTICES AND THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS
OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

They insert the following statement of Accepted Practices
and the Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty in
Annex A to Recommendation VIII-9 for the purposes set out
in operative paragraph 1 of that Recommendation.

(Here would follow the text of ANT/X/18 as amended.)

II

PRIVATE NON-COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS

1. If approached for help or advice by a private, non-
commercial expedition intending to visit their stations
they should request all relevant information about the
expedition from the government of the Consultative Party
in whose territory the expedition is being organized.

2. They urge private, non-commercial expeditions to
carry adequate insurance cover against the risk of their
incurring financial charges or material losses in the
Antarctic Treaty Area.

III

TOUR GUIDES

To the extent practicable, they encourage commercial tour
operators to carry tour guides with experience of Antarctic
conditions, who are aware of the considerations which under-
lie the measures taken by Consultative Parties for the con-
servation of wildlife and protection of the Antarctic
environment.

IV

COMMERCIAL OVERFLIGHTS IN ANTARCTICA

They notify commercial aircraft operators that the recent 
increase in tourist overflight activity:

(i)     exceeds existing capabilities for air traffic control, 
        communications and search and rescue in the Antarctic;

(ii)    may interfere with normal operational flights in 
        support of expeditions engaged in ongoing scientific 
        programs in Antarctica;

(iii)   would exceed the capacity of their Antarctic operations 
        to respond adequately in the event of an unplanned 
        emergency landing.

WASHINGTON, D.C.          

AGENDA ITEM 10              ANT/X/24 (Rev. 1) Add. 1
                                  September 24, 1979

                                  ORIGINAL:  English

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXPEDITIONS IN          
THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA          

(Submitted by the United Kingdom Delegation)          

It is proposed that the following preambular paragraph should be inserted          
in "ANT/X/24 (Rev. 1)" between the first and second preambular paragraphs in          
the text submitted by the Working Group to Plenary:          

Recognizing that, in addition to the statement referred to in the           
previous paragraph which is primarily intended for the organizers          
of tourist expeditions, it would be helpful to the organizers of          
such expeditions to be able to provide to individual visitors a          
brief guide to good conduct in the Antarctic;          

(The purpose of this addition is to introduce the "Guidance for Visitors to          
the Antarctic" which was developed at the Ninth Consultative Meeting but to          
which there is no reference in Recommendation VIII-9.)
