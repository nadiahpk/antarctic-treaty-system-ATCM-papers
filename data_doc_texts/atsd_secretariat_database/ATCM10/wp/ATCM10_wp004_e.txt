SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
REPORT ON SITES WITHIN NEW ZEALAND'S
AREA OF OPERATIONS

(Submitted by the Delegation of New Zealand)
SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
ANT/X/4
Report by the Delegation of New Zealand

Site No.1 - Cape Royds, Ross Island

The boundaries of the site have been marked by painting 
rocks and erecting posts with appropriate signs at all likely 
access points.

The management plans have been strictly enforced and 
all New Zealand personnel receive written instructions 
informing them of the restrictions placed on the area.

A scientific paper describing the apparent success of 
the measures of control has been published (R.B. Thomson, 
Smithsonian Institute 1977) and additional papers are in 
preparation.

It is intended to recommend to the next meeting of SCAR 
(October 1980) that the Date of Expiry of Designation be 
extended two years to 30 June 1983.

Site No.2 - Arrival Heights, Ross Island

Boundaries of the site have been surveyed and posts 
with appropriate signs have been placed at all likely access 
points.

The management plans have been strictly enforced and 
all New Zealand personnel receive written instructions 
informing them of the restrictions placed on the area.

New Zealand personnel visit the area at least once 
every two days to check the operation of scientific recording 
equipment.  No problems have been encountered with "unofficial 
visitors".

The research programme has been modified and new 
equipment installed, all designed to operate within the 
restraints of the management plan.

It is intended to recommend to the next meeting of SCAR 
that the Date of Expiry of Designation be extended two years 
to 30 June 1983.

Site No.3 - Barwick Valley, Victoria Land

New Zealand personnel have not entered this site.
ANT/X/4                                  -2-

New Zealand is considering recommendations for a 
possible review of the management plan to present to the 
next meeting of SCAR.  We do not contemplate any change 
prior to the Date of Expiry of Designation - 30 June 1981.

Site No.4 - Cape Crozier, Ross Island

New Zealand personnel have been instructed not to 
enter this site.  We tend to regard it more as a Specially 
Protected Area.

We intend to recommend to the next meeting of SCAR 
that the Date of Expiry of Designation be extended two 
years to 30 June 1983.
