ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE MINERAL RESOURCES'
PROBLEM IN ANTARCTICA

(Draft Recommendation Submitted by the
Delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics)

The Representatives,

Convinced of the need to preserve and further strengthen the international
regime established by the Antarctic Treaty, which has for 20 years
guaranteed the use of Antarctica exclusively for peaceful purposes,
and in the interest of the development of international cooperation;

Aware of the responsibilities of the Consultative Parties to ensure
that any activities in the Antarctic, including mineral exploration
and exploitation, should they occur, should not become the cause of
international discord, endanger the unique Antarctic environment,
disrupt scientific investigations, or otherwise be contrary to the
purposes or principles of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that Antarctica is a vast region of the earth, with a unique and
extremely vulnerable environment which has yet been studied very
insufficiently;

Conscious of the responsibility, in accordance with the principles and purposes
of the Antarctic Treaty, to protect the Antarctic environment from un-
desirable and dangerous effects of exploration and exploitation of
potential mineral resources in Antarctica should such activities occur;

Conscious of the inadequacy of the existing knowledge for a scientifically
based prediction of ecological consequences of activities involved in
exploration and exploitation of the Antarctic mineral resources, should
these occur;
ANT/X/30

- 2 -

Conscious that because of the special vulnerability of the Antarctic environment, 
exploration and exploitation of potential mineral resources in Antarctica 
if conducted without certain approved international rules, regulations and 
standards, would have a catastrophic effect on the Antarctic environment, 
and may even affect the ecological balance of the Southern Ocean as well 
as of our whole planet;

Noting the Report of the Preparatory Meeting of Ecological, Technological and 
other Related Experts on Mineral Resources Exploration and Exploitation 
in Antarctica (Washington, June 1979);

Noting, in this connection, a need to conduct basic ecological studies in 
Antarctica;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Approved international regulations, standards and rules relating to 
the protection of the Antarctic environment shall constitute an 
important part of a future international regime.

2. Any activity involving exploration and exploitation of the Antarctic 
mineral resources should they occur after an approved international 
regime comes into force shall be conducted in strict compliance with 
the international regulations, standards and rules for the protection 
of the Antarctic environment provided for by this regime with the 
purpose of not permitting any activities in relation to mineral 
resources which would have a harmful effect on the Antarctic environ-
ment and violate the ecological balance in Antarctica.

3. They promote, along with special ecological investigation, intensified 
development of Antarctic studies in biology, meteorology, geology, 
physical oceanography, hydrology, and in other areas to provide 
initial factual data for ecological modelling;

4. They ask SCAR to continue scientific studies on the improved predictions 
of the effects on the Antarctic environment of activities involved 
in exploration and exploitation of the Antarctic mineral resources, 
should such take place; they encourage SCAR, through their National 
Antarctic Committees, to define programs, taking account of para. 12 
of the Experts Report (Washington, June 1979), with the objectives 
of:

    a. retrieving and analyzing relevant information from past observations 
    and research programs;

    b. ensuring in relation to the needs for information identified by 
    the Experts Report that effective use is made of existing 
    programs;

    c. identifying and devloping new programs that should have priority, 
    taking account of the length of time required for results to 
    become available.
