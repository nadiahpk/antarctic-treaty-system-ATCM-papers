HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT          
BY SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATORY DRILLINGS

(Presented by the Delegation of Chile)

INTRODUCTION

All activities related to exploratory drilling and development of oil fields          
entail the possibility of hydrocarbon spills caused by blow outs.  The amount          
of petroleum spilled at sea by these accidents can be very great, as was the case          
on the Bravo shelf in the Ekofish field, in the North Sea, and at the Ixtoc I          
well in Campeche Bay in the Gulf of Mexico.  The Ixtoc I well has been flowing          
at a rate of 20,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil per day since June 3, 1979, and the          
oil slick has covered 800,000 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico.  The damage          
to the ecosystem of the Gulf of Mexico is being calculated.  The Campeche          
accident is a unique opportunity to study the behavior and effects of an oil          
spill on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.  The Ixtoc I spill will          
serve as a model for studying future heavy oil blow outs.  The earlier case in          
the North Sea involved light oil.  Despite all preventive measures, these acci-          
dents could occur in Antarctica, under more unfavorable conditions.  The damage          
to the ecosystem would be greater because of scant oil degradation in the Ant-          
arctic environment.  Furthermore, Antarctica's distance from the main supply          
centers makes it impossible to take rapid steps to combat the spill, and therefore          
its impact will be multiplied.

The Representatives,

Aware of the dangers of hydrocarbon contamination due to scientific explora-          
tory drillings in Antarctica,

Convinced of the necessity of preventing the damage caused by possible un-          
controlled oil flows from scientific exploratory drillings and of establishing
ANT/X/23                                  - 2 -

procedures to reduce the risks involved in such operations,

Bearing in mind that interest in scientific exploratory drilling in Ant-
arctica has increased,

Recalling Recommendation IX-6 of the IX Consultative Meeting, recommend
that their Governments consider:

1. The adoption of measures to situate scientific exploratory drillings
on sites with less possibility of discovering hydrocarbon accumu-
lations. The drillings should be done outside structural anomalies
which may constitute hydrocarbon accumulation traps.

Preliminary geophysical studies should be done (including high
resolution seismic studies) in order to determine which sites are
less likely to contain shallow gas or oil fields, as was done during
the geological research project on the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Shelf
(O.C.S. "Cost Wells").
