national cooperation;

mankind and has served as an example for other international agreements which
have strengthened peace and international security;

Aware that the work which can be done on the continent of Antarctica is in
the interest of all mankind;

DECLARE

Their willingness to remain faithful to its principles so that the continent
of Antarctica, governed by this treaty, may continue to be a zone of peace
