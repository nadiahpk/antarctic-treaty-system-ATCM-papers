OIL CONTAMINATION OF THE ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT

(Draft Recommendation Submitted by the Drafting Committee
to the Working Group on this Agenda Item)

The Representatives,

Recalling that Recommendation IX-6, operative paragraph 4, called for such
reports as may have been prepared on the matters set out in the first three
operative paragraphs to be further considered at the Meeting of Experts
recommended in paragraph 3 of Recommendation IX-1;

Noting that three reports had been submitted to that meeting, (Washington, 1979)
which, between them:

    (i) adequately described the pathways by which oil may reach the
Antarctic marine environment;

   (ii) concentrated on the question of baseline levels of contamination
and programmes for further study of this question;

  (iii) devoted less attention to proposals relating to practicable means
by which oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment
might be reduced;

Recognising that methods for analysing dissolved hydrocarbons have not yet
reached the stage where they can be used on a routine basis and that results
have given rise to doubts as to their significance especially regarding very
low levels of contamination in the open ocean;

Recognising that determination of baseline levels of hydrocarbon contamination
in representative components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem (including birds
and mammals) would probably, in the medium term, provide a more cost-effective
insight into levels of oil contamination of the Antarctic marine environment;
ANT/X/40

- 2 -

Noting that up to now the most significant introduction of oil in the Antarctic 
marine environment has appeared to be from the operation of ships and that there 
are international agreements aimed at reducing the levels of oil contamination 
of the marine environment generally;

Recognising that the Antarctic is especially hazardous for the operation of 
ships; and

Noting that in most instances it is not possible to adapt existing ships to 
more stringent standards for the prevention of the contamination of the sea by 
oil other than at prohibitive cost;

Recommend to their Governments that they take note of Section III (annexed) of 
the Report of Ecologicol, Technological, and other Related Experts on Mineral 
Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica (Washington, 1979), and that:

I

Baseline Levels of Contamination

1. While co-ordinating programmes through their National Committees and SCAR, 
they encourage studies of:

    (a) baseline levels of hydrocarbon contamination in representative com-
        ponents of the Antarctic marine ecosystem (including birds and mammals);

    (b) first and second order effects of various kinds and concentrations of 
        hydrocarbons (and other pollutants) on key components of the Antarctic 
        marine ecosystem;

    (c) the methodology of analysing low levels of dissolved hydrocarbon con-
        tamination of the marine environment and its development for purposes 
        of routine measurements.

2. Through their National Antarctic Committees, they invite SCAR in consul-
tation with other competent international organizations, to keep under 
review the possibility of developing a programme for the determination of 
baseline levels of hydrocarbon contamination relevant to the needs for such 
determinations in the Antarctic marine environment.

II

Reduction of Contamination

1. They review their respective obligations under existing international agree-
ments to which they are parties relating to the reduction of contamination 
of the sea by oil and, in the light of the particularly hazardous nature of 
the Antarctic for ship operations, consider whether their compliance with 
these obligations adequately minimizes the risk of oil contamination of the 
Antarctic marine environment;

2. They be prepared to discuss this matter further at the Eleventh Consultative 
Meeting.
