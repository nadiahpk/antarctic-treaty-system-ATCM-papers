Regulations and procedures for vessels  proceeding to Antarctica

Introduction
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in tourist activities and other non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Continent.
Due to these activities, great concern has arisen among the States Parties to the Antarctic Treaty System (STA), not only for potential damage to the environment, but also because of the aspects related to  the precarious security of navigation and adverse environmental conditions, usually unfavorable to Search and Rescue operations (SAR).
Regulations
In order to regulate tourist activities and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica, in compliance with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and the Madrid Protocol, the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) listed the rules and procedures which must be observed by ships and citizens involved in all expeditions proceeding to Antarctica,  organized in its territory or coming from it.
In the case of individuals or non-governmental organizations, Brazil does not have specific legislation yet. In order to minimize possible occurrences of private vessels of Brazilian citizens and, therefore, without appropriate initial assessment of environmental impact, determined by the Madrid Protocol, the Inter-Ministerial Secretariat for Sea Resources (SECIRM) makes available on its website since 2010, the general rules for visitors to Antarctica, which contains instructions and required Environmental Form for Brazilian ships and private vessels and Brazilian citizens who wish to carry out expeditions to Antarctica.
Dissemination
Aiming to intensify and expand the dissemination of those instructions, official papers were forwarded to the Directorate of Ports and Coasts (DPC), the body responsible for the spread of these instructions to the Port Authorities and subordinate agencies, in order to promote the widest possible dissemination to the maritime community in their respective areas of Brazilian jurisdiction.
Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES)
Currently the PROANTAR makes available, through the Electronic Information Exchange System, the necessary information described in art. VII of the Antarctic Treaty, as well as those adopted by other measures in the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), reporting on:
    a) all expeditions to and within Antarctica, on the part of its ships or nationals, and all expeditions to Antarctica organized in and proceeding from its territory;
    b) all Antarctic stations occupied by its nationals; and
    c) all personnel and equipment intended to be introduced by it into Antarctica.
