COMNAP Search & Rescue (SAR) Workshop III









COMNAP Search & Rescue (SAR) Workshop III

Background
COMNAP considers safety of human life of primary concern in all Antarctic activities. In support of safe Antarctic operations, COMNAP convened Search and Rescue (SAR) Workshop I (2008, Viña del Mar/Valparaiso) and SAR Workshop II (2009, Bueños Aires, Argentina) to increase collaboration on Antarctic SAR matters. Recalling the discussion at the ATCM SAR Special Working Group in 2013 and ATCM Recommendation 4 (2013) Improved Collaboration on Search and Rescue (SAR) in Antarctica, COMNAP continues to support regular SAR Workshops and will convene COMNAP SAR Workshop III in Valparaiso on 1 and 2 June 2016. The Workshop is co-hosted with generous support from DIRECTEMAR and INACH and will be held at MRCC Chile.
COMNAP SAR Workshop III
Resolution 4 (2013) recommends that the Parties, “…support COMNAP to continue to foster collaborative discussions and vital sharing of information regarding SAR matters including through: Holding triennial workshops on Search and Rescue…”

The next COMNAP SAR Workshop will be held in Valparaiso, Chile, at MRCC Chile on 1-2 June 2016. The Workshop will operate all plenary sessions with Spanish and English translation.  COMNAP is working with the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) and with DIRECTEMAR Chile, to co-host the event. Plans are well-advanced.

To date, forty people have registered to attend. As per Recommendation 4 (2013), the workshop has invited representatives from all of the relevant RCCs, from National Antarctic Programs, relevant experts including from IAATO, CCAMLR and IMO, as well as commercial emergency notification service providers. The invited keynote speaker will be Ms. Cheryl Bertoia, Deputy Head/Principal Operations Officer Cospas-Sarsat Secretariat.

Objectives
The overarching objective of the workshop is to continue to improve Search and Rescue coordination and response in the Antarctic as a follow-up on SAR Workshops I (2008) and II (2009).  

Specific objectives of this third workshop are to:  
    • Conduct a review of progress, in particular on actions arising from the previous workshops;
    • Continue exchange of timely and useful information that can be used in the event of a SAR situation;
    • Review the COMNAP SAR webpage and enhance to meet its goals and purpose;
    • Update all participants on the implementation of the IMO Polar Code;
    • Discuss lessons learned from recent real SAR incidents;
    • Carry out a “live” table top SAR exercise to increase response capabilities in the future.

The workshop information, including the agenda is presented as an appendix to this Information Paper and a full report will be made available shortly after the workshop. Items of critical importance to the ATCM and CEP will be brought back to those bodies immediately and also reported back to the 2017 meetings.	

A webpage has been set up to provide information as it becomes available.
