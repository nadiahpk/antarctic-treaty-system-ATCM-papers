National Antarctic Programme use of locations with Visitor Site Guidelines in 2015-16

Information Paper presented by the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia and the United States
Summary
In response to a CEP recommendation, this paper provides an overview of information provided by Parties on visits by their National Antarctic Programme (NAP) personnel to locations with ATCM Site Guidelines for Visitors in place, during the 2015-16 season. 
Background
CEPXVI (Final Report, paragraph 153) endorsed Recommendation 1 of ATCMXXXVI/WP15 Policy Issues Arising from the 2013 On-Site Review of Guidelines for Visitor Sites in the Antarctic Peninsula, which resulted from a multi-party review visit, that Parties continue to make efforts to ensure that all visitors to sites covered by ATCM Site Guidelines are aware, and make use of, the Guidelines.  The CEP also noted that this should include recreational visits by NAP personnel as well as visitors participating in private or non-commercial activity.  The ATCM noted the CEP’s endorsement of this recommendation (ATCM XXXVI Final Report, paragraph 136).

In considering Recommendation 2 of ATCMXXXVI/WP15 (which was for the CEP to consider the value of a survey to establish the level of recreational visits from NAP staff to sites with Site Guidelines in place),   the CEP encouraged members to bring forward information on recreational visits to sites subject to Site Guidelines, by NAP personnel.  The United Kingdom offered to coordinate an informal process to collate information and ATCM XXXVII/IP59 National Antarctic Programme use of locations with Visitor Site Guidelines in 2013-14 and ATCM XXXVIII/IP119  National Antarctic Programme use of locations with Visitor Site Guidelines in 2014-15 summarised this information. 

The submitting Parties considered that there was value in continuing the assessment in 2015-16 and the United Kingdom commissioned information from all CEP contacts about NAP visits to sites covered by Site Guidelines to report to CEP XIX.  Fifteen Members responded. Five reported that members of their NAPs had visited sites with Site Guidelines, while 10 respondents reported no visits of their NAPs. We encourage the remaining 23 CEP contacts to provide similar information regarding visits to sites covered by Site Guidelines by their NAPs. This will allow us to compile a complete picture, which will aid the CEP in its consideration of human impact at frequently visited sites and the effectiveness of Site Guidelines.  Details of the responses received are provided at Annex A.  

Analysis

National Antarctic Programmes
After two years of data collection (the data included in this year’s return is not included in the analysis due to time constraints), we have prepared a number of different analyses of the use of locations with Visitor Site Guidelines by National Antarctic Programmes (NAPs). For these analyses, a regional approach was considered. The whole area was subdivided in four regions: South Shetland Islands, Northern Peninsula and Weddell Sea, Western Peninsula, and the Ross Sea. 

In general terms, the analyses indicate that 43% of the sites that have guidelines have been visited by personnel belonging to NAPs (16 out of 37), accounting for 1400 visitors.

Regarding the number of visitors, i.e. the number of people that effectively visited the site, the analysis shows that the two most visited regions were the Western Peninsula (528 visitors) and the Ross Sea (505 visitors), although number of sites visited in each region were uneven. In the Western Peninsula the visits were distributed among six sites and in the Ross Sea area almost all visits were concentrated in only one place. The South Shetland Islands ranked third (310 visitors) with visits concentrated  in three sites, followed distantly by the Northern Peninsula and Weddell Sea , which were visited by only 4% of all visitors (n=57), who visited two sites in this area.

In the Western Peninsula, Goudier Island/ Port Lockroy was the most visited site (343 visitors) followed by Torgerson Island (112 visitors). In the Ross Sea, visits were almost completely concentrated at Cape Royds (502 visitors). In the South Shetland Islands, Deception Island received over 72% of the total visitors to the region (n= 225), followed by Half Moon Island with 20% of visitors (n=60). The Northern Peninsula and Weddell Sea received the lowest number of visitors, evenly distributed between Brown Bluff (n=28) and Snow Hill (n=29). Table 1 summarizes the information included above.

Table 1: Summary of 2013-14/ 2014/2015 information provided by participants of the survey


Regarding the sites that received the most number of visits, i.e. number of times that a site was visited during the two-season study, Cape Royds received the most NAP visits, with over 56% of the visits (n=73), followed distantly by Torgerson Island, with 12.4% (n=16 visits), and Goudier Island/ Port Lockroy, with less than 10% of the visits (n=10 visits)

Comparison between NAPs and non-governmental organisations
Finally, visitation of locations with Visitor Site Guidelines was compared between NAPs and non-governmental organisations. For this, information contained in an IAATO paper - ATCMXXXVIII - IP 85   (Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2013-14 and 2014-15 Season) was used. Based on this information, comparisons were only possible for six out of the 16 sites visited by NAPs (Goudier Island, Port Lockroy, Whalers bay, Half Moon island, Brown Bluff, Damoy Point and Telefon Bay). For the comparison, total number of visits and visitors were calculated using data reported by both IAATO and NAPs.

Since not all NAPs have reported, a comparison with non-governmental visits cannot be performed comprehensively. Therefore, this analysis is intended only as an approximation of the real situation. In this sense, comparing the total number of visits, the analysis show that visits from NAPs represent between 3.4% (Whalers Bay) and 0.8% (Brown Bluff) of total visits for Sites with Visitor Site Guidelines. When taking into account the total number of visitors, NAPs visitors represents between 1.2% (Goudier Island) and 0.04% (Telefon Point) of total visitors. 

Conclusion

It seems clear that visits from personnel of NAPs, compared to total visits, remain at very low levels. However, sites visited by NAPs represent almost half of all sites that have guidelines. In this regard, it is considered highly desirable for the personnel of the NAPs to implement the provisions contained in the Site Guidelines, every time they conduct recreational visits to these places. In our understanding, few people poorly trained or supervised could also cause damage. As such it is recommended that Parties continue to disseminate information and train staff on the content of the Site Guidelines, ensuring they are available in means of transport and Antarctic facilities, particularly those located in close proximity to sites covered by Site Guidelines.

It should be noted that the Ross Sea Visitor Site 21 (Cape Royds) is unusual in that it is also subject to the management plan of ASPA 157, Cape Royds, which includes HSM 15, the hut built by the Shackleton Nimrod expedition.  This management plan includes provisions that require an experienced “hut guide” to accompany visitors to ensure compliance with the management plan and its Code of Conduct. The management plan also limits the maximum number of visitors to the area at one time to 40,  the maximum number of visitors inside the hut at one time to 8 and the maximum annual visitors to 2000 (current average visitor levels between 1998/99 and 2013/14 is 767 per year). Thus, it is unlikely that inadvertent damage to the site would occur due to either NGO or NAP visitors.

In order to improve the scope of the analysis, Parties are encouraged to continue to record information about visits of staff of National Programmes to sites that have Site Guidelines for visitors and it may be valuable for the CEP to review this information again in the future. The information paper authors urge COMNAP to remind its members of the desirability of using Visitor Sit Guidelines for NAP recreational visits, noting the CEP’s advice in Resolution 4 (2014).
