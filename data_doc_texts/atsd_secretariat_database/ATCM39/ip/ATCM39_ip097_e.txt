in the Antarctic Area
(Program 2010-2020)
Information Document presented by Chile
SUMMARY
The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Navy (SHOA)
is the official permanent technical body of the Chilean State that
manufactures the National Nautical Cartography. At the same time,
SHOA participates actively in the Antarctic Hydrographic
Commission (CHA), which is responsible for the planning and
prioritization of the hydro-cartographic activities carried out in the
Antarctica and that are executed by the Member States of the
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), which aim is to
contribute to the safety of navigation and to the protection of the
marine environment.
Currently, this Service is executing a Hydrographic Survey Program
in the Antarctica, which began in 2010 and is scheduled to last until
2020. This program considers the production of International
Cartography of the area.
ACTIVITIES PERFORMED
According to the Hydrographic Survey Program in the Antarctica
(see Table N° 1), since 2010, the SHOA has performed four survey
stages in the area of the Gerlache Strait –Useful Islet to Wednesday
Island (see Figure N° 1), with the aim of collecting the information
in site that contributes to the issuing of Nautical Chart N° 15350
(INT 9104). Together with the previous, during 2013, a
photogrammetric restitution of General Chart N° 15350 and
Particular Chart N° 15351 “Anchorage Places in Peltier and
Neumayer Channels” was carried out. For both cases, a bathymetric
compilation was performed, with data from SHOA, from UKHO
(United Kingdom Hydrographic Office) and from SHOM (Service
Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine), according to
cooperation agreements between United Kingdom, France and Chile
within the framework of the CHA.
After the Hydrographic Survey Program, during 2014 and 2015, the
work in the area of the Gerlache Strait continued, but enclosed in
the area between Markmann Bay and Andvord Bay (see Figure N°
1). This area will be considered for the future edition of Nautical
Chart N° 15340 (INT 9103).
Besides the tasks performed by SHOA in 2015, the staff of the
“Centro de Investigaciones Oceanográficas e Hidrográficas del
Caribe (CIOH)”, on board the Colombian oceanic vessel ARC “20 de
Julio”, performed their first expedition to the Antarctic continent.
Within their tasks, they made a complementary sounding in the
areas considered in the Nautical Chart N° 15340, so this
bathymetric information can eventually feed the Nautical Chart that
our country, through SHOA, must manufacture.
Currently, the first out of two stages of hydrographic works
(2016-2017) planned for the South Shetland Islands – King George
Island to Livingstone Island, is being executed. For this case, Brazil
would provide complementary bathymetric information to produce
the future Nautical Chart N° 14200 (INT 9151), incorporating the
New Edition of SHOA Chart N° 14210 “Admiralty Bay” and the New
Chart N° 14213 “Mackellar and Martel Coves” (see Figure N° 2) to
the future production of the particular cartography of the area.
Finally, from 2018, the execution of three Campaigns in the
Antarctica is scheduled. These will focus in the general area of the
Gerlache Strait, and the objective is to make progress in the
development of Nautical Chart N° 15300 (INT 9157), in cooperation
with the United Kingdom (see Figure N° 1).

CONCLUSIONS
Up to this date, the SHOA Hydrographic Survey Program in the
Antarctic area has been materialized with the execution of seven
Campaigns, specifically in the Gerlache Strait and the South
Shetland Islands areas (2010-2016).
The previous has allowed contributing to the development of new
cartographic products of the Antarctic continent. In 2013, the
national version of the New SHOA Chart N° 15352 “Gloria Inlet”
was published, in scale 1:7.000, in paper and electronic format
(2014). And during 2015, the edition and publication in paper of
Charts 15351 (INT 9134) and 15352 (INT 9135) were materialized.
During 2016, the cartographic production of SHOA Chart N° 15350
(INT 9104) “Gerlache Strait. Useful Islet to Wednesday Island” will
continue. In 2017, the edition of Chart N° 15340 (INT 9103)
“Gerlache Strait. Markmann Bay to Andvord Bay” is considered to
be produced.
The participation and exchange of information among the countries
has allowed the progress in the generation of cartographic products
in the Antarctica. Chile must still finish the Hydrographic Survey
Program agreed in 2009. In this sense, we will keep making
progress with the commitments engaged by the Antarctic
Hydrographic Commission (CHA), to contribute in the delivery of
more safety of navigation.
