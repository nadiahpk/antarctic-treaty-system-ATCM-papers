Modernisation of GONDWANA Station, Terra Nova Bay, northern Victoria Land
Information Paper submitted by Germany



The German Gondwana Station (Fig. 1) is a non-permanent facility at Gerlache Inlet of Terra Nova Bay on the Ross Sea, operated by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR). It was erected during the GANOVEX III expedition in 1982/1983 as a bivouac hut and then extended and converted into a summer station during GANOVEX V (1988/1989). The main building consists of 16 interconnected 20-foot containers. Gondwana Station is accessible by ship or an aeroplane capable of landing on the sea ice in Terra Nova Bay. Gondwana Station was used as the main base during numerous BGR expeditions to northern Victoria Land.

After more than 25 years of its existence, a major renovation and modernisation of the station was necessary, which was carried out in the 2015/2016 Antarctic season. 

In advance of the planned activities, BGR presented an Initial Environmental Study (IES) in order to evaluate and present the impact on the Antarctic environment. The IES was submitted to the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) in April 2015. UBA carried out an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) arriving at the conclusion that the planned activity gives cause to suspect less than a minor and transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. UBA granted an appropriate permit on 13 November 2015 under a condition and several provisos.

In general, the modernization of the station will lead to an improvement of working conditions, increase of maintenance feasibility and its operating efficiency, and considerable decrease of the environmental impact and the reduction of human footprint. This could be achieved by installation of the following new facilities:
    • a pair of generators (40 kVA each) 
    • photovoltaic plant (40 kW) and an associated battery installation 
    • solar air panels
    • electric heating installation  
    • snow melting installation (electrically driven)
    • water supply and water treatment system (water disinfection and a reverse osmosis system)
    • kitchen and sanitary installations

Further, the new waste management is based on a more efficient state-of-the-art wastewater treatment, which includes a mechanic and a biological component. As a result, the quality of the wastewater, which is discharged into the sea can be improved significantly and meets modern high standards.

The work was carried out by installation of a temporary construction camp at the station between end-December 2015 and mid-February 2016. The infrastructure of the station remained basically unchanged. The renovation/modernization of the station allows its future operation to continue for at least 25-30 years as a base for scientific research in northern Victoria Land.

Transport of building material, construction equipment and personnel was done with the logistic support of the Italian National Antarctic Research Programme. Germany very much acknowledges the support of the neighbouring stations Jang Bogo and Mario Zucchelli of the Korean and Italian National Antarctic Programmes.
