United Kingdom’s Antarctic Science: Summary of British Antarctic Survey Science Priorities 2016-20 

Information Paper presented by the United Kingdom
Summary
This paper provides an overview of the current science priorities of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), the UK’s National Antarctic operator.  
Background
As one of six centres owned by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the British Antarctic Survey delivers a programme of strategic science focussed on the polar regions and provides logistical support to the UK polar science community.  It provides advice to UK government on issues pertaining to the polar regions, and seeks to collaborate with scientists and logistics providers in many nations. Above all, BAS is committed to maintaining safe operations in extreme environments and to the environmental stewardship of the polar regions.

Polar Science for Planet Earth
The BAS research programme, Polar Science for Planet Earth, addresses scientific questions that affect the entire planet and the lives of the individuals on it. The answers to these questions will deliver real benefits to society and underpin national and international policies. 
The work reflects NERC’s aspirations that UK environmental science should assist us in benefiting responsibly from natural resources, developing resilience to environmental hazards, supporting management of environmental change, and answering fundamental questions about how the Earth System works.
BAS’s multidisciplinary science teams develop and deliver a portfolio of research projects funded from a variety of sources, and designed to address the scientific and societal issues that will lead to responsible environmental management and produce lasting benefits.  Each team will contribute to the Grand Challenges we have identified for polar science (see figure)
    • Polar Change – Understand the causes and impacts of global change
    • Earth and the Poles – Understand how polar processes impact the global system
    • People and the Poles – Develop resilience to environmental hazards and manage natural resources
    • Polar Frontiers – Explore the frontiers of knowledge
    • Polar expertise – wherever it can be applied.

BAS Science Programme – key questions
Within the BAS science portfolio we seek to answer key questions:
Past climate and environment – a window on future Earth
    • What can we learn about the future of global climate and environments from records of past climate and environments in the polar regions?
    • What can we learn about future ice-sheet change and sea-level change from understanding past change in the polar ice sheets?
Polar Biodiversity, Adaptation and Evolution - responses to change
    • How did life evolve and adapt to extreme polar environments?
    • How does the present distribution of species and genes reflect past environmental changes that drove adaptation and migration? 
    • How will future changes in the polar regions impact communities, species and ecosystems?
Ecosystem - structure, function and future
    • How will multiple drivers of change impact polar marine ecosystems?
    • How will changes in the polar marine ecosystems impact global ecosystems and cycles, and their representation in models?
Polar oceans – circulation and global climate
    • How do changes in the Earth System impact the polar ocean and its interactions?
    • How do changes in the polar oceans affect the fluxes through the global ocean system?
Ice sheets, ice shelves and global sea-level
    • What are the underlying drivers and key processes responsible for recent ice-loss from Antarctica and Greenland? 
    • How will ice-sheet change influence global and regional sea levels in future decades to centuries?
Sea ice 
    • What are the key processes that have caused decreases in Arctic sea-ice extent and increases in Antarctic extent?
    • How are/will changes in sea-ice affect polar ecosystems and biogeochemical fluxes?
    • How will changes in sea-ice in the polar regions impact the global atmosphere and oceans?
Geology – linking solid Earth and the cryosphere
    • How does the structure of the solid Earth influence the development of the polar landscape and its ice cover?
Polar climate variability and change - drivers, process and prediction
    • How does global climate change manifest itself in the polar regions?
    • How do changes and polar climates influence the global climate system?
    • How can improvements in the representation and processes in global climate models improve the performance of those models on a global scale?
Polar atmospheres - structure, composition, and processes
    • How do the key features of the polar environment control significant chemical processes?
    • How does polar atmospheric chemistry impact global atmospheric composition?
The space environment – its impact on modern day life
    • What risk do extreme space weather event pose to satellite and terrestrial infrastructures?
    • What role do variations in the energy and particle flux from the sun have on global climate?
Managing human impacts in polar regions
    • How are marine ecosystems changing and what are the underlying causes of these changes?
    • How are populations of higher predators changing and what are the underlying causes of these change?
    • What are the barriers to invasion of the polar region by alien species, and how are these barriers being altered by climate change and other factors?
