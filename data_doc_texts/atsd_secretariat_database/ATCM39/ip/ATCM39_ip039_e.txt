Inspections of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas in the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula Regions by the United States Antarctic Program









Inspections of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas in the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula Regions by the United States Antarctic Program
Information Paper submitted by the United States
Summary
During the 2015-2016 austral summer season, the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) conducted inspections of eight Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) in the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula regions.  In general, the USAP found that all ASPAs visited continue to protect the special values that were the basis for the original designation.  A common issue identified as a result of the inspections is the need for clearer and adequate markings on the ground (i.e. signs) and on ASPA maps (i.e. labels) of boundaries, landing locations, entry points, and trails.  The United States anticipates that the general observations and ASPA inspection reports included in this information paper will be useful in future reviews of the relevant APSA Management Plans.
Introduction
Observers from the USAP visited eight ASPAs in the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula regions in order to ensure that the ASPAs continued to protect the special values based upon which they were initially designated and to inform future ASPA Management Plan reviews.  Article 6 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol) states that “a review of a Management Plan shall be initiated at least every five years.”  The ASPA inspection reports herein could be employed during such reviews.
The United States also presents the ASPA inspection reports and outcomes in this paper according to Article 10 of Annex V to the Protocol that provides for Parties to “make arrangements for collecting and exchanging records, including records of permits and reports of visits, including inspection visits, to Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and reports of visits to Antarctic Specially Managed Areas.”
Historical Perspective
In 2005, a joint New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States team of Observers inspected five ASPAs and one ASMA in the Ross Sea region as described in ATCM XXIX WP 34 Ross Sea Protected Area Inspections 2006.  In general the joint inspection program found that Areas’ Management Plans were fit for purpose, relevant, and well implemented.  Recommendations were made in order to address some issues that were noted at certain sites.  Key recommendations included: the need for increased, improved, and more accurate signage, especially at some sites with high visitation rates; the need for updated and improved maps, especially for Special Features; a joint effort to inventory the sites of past activity in the Dry Valleys to be used as a basis for coordinated clean-up; the designation of certain Special Features within the Dry Valleys ASMA as ASPAs; and the ongoing conservation and protection of historic huts and artefacts.  Parties have implemented many of these recommendations in the intervening years.  During the inspections of ASPAs by the USAP in 2015-2016, the Observers reflected upon the recommendations made by the 2005 joint inspection program.
ASPA Inspections 2015-2016
Observers from the USAP, designated by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), conducted the inspections. The ASPA Management Plan and other relevant background information were reviewed prior to the start of the inspection.  The “Checklist to Assist in the Inspection of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas” (Resolution 4 (2008) was used as a guide during these visits. The inspections were planned and conducted, when possible, in coordination with science and program support activities in order to minimize environmental impact.
Some of the aims of the inspections were similar to those stated by the joint inspection program in ATCM XXIX WP 34 Ross Sea Protected Area Inspections 2006.  These goals included identifying whether significant changes had occurred within the ASPA and whether the ASPA Management Plan, as implemented, remains relevant and is sufficient to protect the values of the Area.  An additional goal of the 2015-2016 inspections was to implement an improved and structured ASPA review process for the USAP.
Five inspections were conducted of ASPAs in the Ross Sea region:
    • Cape Hallett, ASPA 106
    • Cape Royds, ASPA 121
    • Arrival Heights, ASPA 122
    • Barwick and Balham Valleys, ASPA 123
    • Cape Crozier, ASPA 124
In addition, three ASPA inspections were performed in the Antarctic Peninsula region:
    • Litchfield Island, ASPA 113
    • Biscoe Point, ASPA 139
    • Cape Shirreff and San Telmo, ASPA 149
Remarks and Recommendations
Each of the ASPAs visited during these inspections continue to protect the special values that were the basis for the original designation of the Area.  While no significant changes to the inspected ASPAs were identified, monitoring ASPAs for changes should continue, particularly in light of the ongoing climatic and ecological changes on the Antarctic continent.
Specific observations and recommendations for each ASPA visited are summarized in Table 1 and included in more details in the individual ASPA inspections reports (Annex A). When considering the ASPAs inspected in 2015-2016 as a whole, the USAP recommends the following:
    • Signs should be adequate and sufficient to clearly mark boundaries.  Signs posted at regularly used entry points should identify boundaries and provide necessary protocols.
    • Those entering the ASPA should be prepared with maps and GPS to avoid entering restricted zones and to use marked trails, when applicable.
    • All landing locations (e.g. vessel, plane, and helicopter) should be clearly labelled on maps and, when practicable, marked clearly in the field.
    • Review of maps during visits by personnel and researchers familiar with the ASPA values are critical for maintaining accuracy.  Accurate and updated maps are invaluable tools for ASPA management.
    • Identifying issues during regular ASPA reviews should allow recommended management improvements to be made in a timely manner.
Table 1. Key Observations and Recommendations from the 2015-2016 USAP ASPA Inspections 
ASPA
Observations and Recommendations
ASPA 106: Cape Hallett, North Victoria Land, Ross Sea
    • A sign showing the location and boundaries of the Area with clear statements of entry restrictions should be placed near the Automatic Weather Station to help avoid inadvertent entry.
    • Cairns marking the restricted zone should be maintained to avoid inadvertent entry.
    • Adjustments to area boundaries should be considered as penguin populations grow and change.  
    • The area should be monitored for debris from previous station activities.  Buried debris or other contamination may be uncovered if artificially constructed penguin mounds continue to deflate over time.  
ASPA 113: Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbor, Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago
    • The campsite indicated on the Management Plan map is not recommended for use due to increased seal populations and the proximity to Palmer Station.  Maps should be updated to remove the camping location.  
    • A sign indicating that the island is protected and requires special permitting had been placed on the south end of the island is no longer in place.  A replacement sign would be useful for reminding those visiting the Litchfield Island area of the protections in place.  
ASPA 121: Cape Royds, Ross Island
    • The boundary of ASPA 121 is marked regularly with signs, however an area near the penguin viewing area outside the ASPA was identified as requiring additional signage in order to avoid unintentional ASPA entry. As part of the management of the ASPA, a sign was added in the 2015-2016 season after discussions the USAP and Antarctica New Zealand. 
    • Regularly used entry points to the ASPA should be marked with clear signage, including some detail on site guidelines. 
    • Increased and replacement signage could be considered for the adjacent ASPA 157, Backdoor Bay. 
ASPA 122: Arrival Heights, Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island
    • Arrival Heights ASPA values should be addressed during any adjacent station infrastructure improvements.  
    • Signs should be replaced on a regular basis due to wind ablating the reflective cover.  Signs with ASPA management guidelines designed to minimize disturbance from radio use and vehicle lights should be visible during the entire year.
ASPA 123: Barwick and Balham Valley, Southern Victoria Land
    • Consider identifying a helicopter landing location within Barwick Valley to be used only for purposes allowed for by the ASPA Management Plan in order to minimize impacts to Area.
    • Continue management of Area by limiting activities in the area to research that cannot be conducted elsewhere and essential management activities aimed at continuing to protect the values of the ASPA. 
ASPA 124: Cape Crozier, Ross Island
    • Consider removing signs from posts at the end of each season to protect them from ablation over the winter and replacing the signs at the start of the following season.  The posts and the post top pieces could be left out over winter without significant risk of degradation.  
    • To protect lichen growing outside of the ASPA, rock cairns or other appropriate markings could be placed along a specified route to encourage the use of a consistent path from the hut to the ASPA.
ASPA 139: Biscoe Point, Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago
    • Consider updating the Management Plan maps, including potential camping sites, during the next Management Plan review.
    • Management of Area by limiting activities in the area to research that cannot be conducted elsewhere and critical management activities should continue to protect the values of the ASPA.   
ASPA 149: Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Island, Livingston Islands, South Shetland Islands
    • Consider updating the Management Plan maps to reflect the current boundaries of seal colonies and trails.
    • A sign indicating that the island is protected and requires special permitting had been placed on the south end of the island and should be replaced.

Annex A. 2015-2016 USAP ASPA Inspection Reports
Inspection Report: ASPA 106: Cape Hallett, North Victoria Land, Ross Sea
Introduction
Cape Hallett was proposed by the U.S. in 1966 and was adopted as Specially Protected Area (SPA) No.7.  The boundary was initially only Seabee Hook, but it currently encompasses all of Seabee Hook and land east of Seabee Hook that contains a rich assortment of lichens and algae.  It is the only protected area in northern Victoria Land designated on the grounds of its terrestrial ecosystem or which includes a substantial bird colony, providing an important representation of the ecosystem in this region of Antarctica. A restricted zone and historic marker also present within the protected area.  The area was renamed and renumbered in 2002.  The Management Plan for ASPA 106 can be found at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt%5Catt567_e.pdf. 
Site Inspection
The USAP inspection team visited the site on 26 October 2015.  Two members of a science group also travelled to the site to perform yearly updates to the USAP Automatic Weather Station (AWS) at the site.  Transport to the site was by Twin Otter aircraft that landed approximately ¼-mile southwest of the penguin colony.   Access into the site was by foot. The inspection team performed reconnaissance of the entire site.  Inspection of key features of the ASPA, debris removal, and inventory of debris were performed.  No entry was made into the restricted zone.  Ground time in the Area was approximately four hours.  
Key observations were:
    • Debris from former station present in the northwest portion of the site.  Debris included small wood and metal, as well as partially buried open top 55-gallon drums, posts, concrete blocks, and other metal items.
    • GPS coordinates for various points in the ASPA were confirmed.  
    • The Restricted Zone was marked, but cairns were small and not easily identified. 
    • Penguins were occupying partially buried 55-gallon drums and nesting near old overhead line poles that had been cut near the surface. 
    • The Visitor Site Guidelines areas are not marked. 
    • Current maps identify a New Zealand fuel cache and Automatic Weather Station.  Antarctica New Zealand Environmental staff reported that these were removed in previous years. 
Human Activity
Research and management activities at the site by the United States are limited due to the distance and support required to reach the site.  USAP researchers did camp at the site this year for research on penguin colonies with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation and helicopter support from the nearby Italian base Mario Zucchelli.  
Management activities include monitoring the number of people entering the ASPA on an annual basis.
Recommendations
    • A sign showing the location and boundaries of the Area with clear statements of entry restrictions should be placed near the Automatic Weather Station to help avoid inadvertent entry.
    • Cairns marking the restricted zone should be maintained to avoid inadvertent entry.  GPS should be used when working in the area.
    • Those visiting the site should review maps to understand the boundaries of the Visitor Site Guidelines areas.     
    • Adjustments to area boundaries should be considered as penguin populations grow and change.  
    • The area should be monitored for debris from previous station activities.  Buried debris or other contamination may be uncovered if artificially constructed penguin mounds continue to deflate over time.  

Inspection report: ASPA 113: Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbour, Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago
Introduction
Litchfield Island lies within Arthur Harbour in the Palmer Basin ASMA.  The primary reason for the designation of the Area is that it ‘possesses an unusually high collection of marine and terrestrial life, is unique amongst the neighboring islands as a breeding place for six species of native birds and provides an outstanding example of the natural ecological system of the Antarctic Peninsula area its extensive vegetation communities, soils and terrestrial ecology’ as stated in the Management Plan at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/Att541_e.pdf. The breeding birds of the island are the birds typical of the western Antarctic Peninsula.  Rich moss carpets are protected from seals and birds on the islands steep and variable topography.
The ASPA is within the Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin ASMA no. 7.  The island is accessible by small boat from Palmer Station.  Cruise ships commonly visit Palmer Station and Arthur Harbour.  The site was last reviewed in 2014 with updates made to maps and text referring to status of local flora and fauna.
Site Inspection
A USAP inspection team member performed a site visit of the northern portion of the ASPA on 4 March 2016.  The eastern landing location, illustrated in Map 2 of the ASPA Management Plan, was accessed by a Zodiac watercraft.   Travel around the island was on foot.  Approximate ground time at the ASPA was two hours.
Key observations were:
    • Numerous fur seals and elephant seals were present on the east side of the island.  Moss beds in an elephant seal wallow were visibly damaged.
    • A pin for tying boats to the shore was present at the specified landing area indicated on Map 2 of the Management Plan.  
    • The camping area identified on Map 2 was occupied by seals.
    • Moss carpets were still present on steep slopes, but mosses in low-lying areas have been impacted by seal populations in the area.  
    • Signs indicating that the island is protected are referenced in the Management Plan, but no signs were identified onsite.  
Human Activity
Human activity in the area is limited.  Scientific research is limited to monitoring of penguin and skua populations.  In addition, there are some visits made for educational and outreach purposes as well as for essential management activities.
Recommendations
    • The campsite indicated on the Management Plan map is not recommended for use due to increased seal populations and the proximity to Palmer Station.  Maps should be updated to remove the camping location.
    • Those entering the ASPA should review the Management Plan, especially in reference to the cleaning of gear before entering the Area, prior to conducting research or management activities in the Area.  This will help protect the values of the ASPA.  
    • A sign indicating that the island is protected and requires special permitting had been placed on the south end of the island is no longer in place.  A replacement sign would be useful for reminding those visiting the Litchfield Island area of the protections in place.  

Inspection Report: ASPA 121: Cape Royds, Ross Island 
Introduction
The United States originally proposed Cape Royds because it supports the most southerly established Adélie penguin colony known, for which there exists a long-term series of population data.  It was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 1 in Recommendation VIII-4 (1975) and redesignated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area no. 121 by Decision 1 (2002).  The area also protects unique freshwater and terrestrial ecological values.  The ASPA is the type locality for several forms of snow algae that were first collected during Shackleton’s British Antarctic Expeditions of 1907-09 according to the ASPA Management Plan at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/att542_e.pdf. 
ASPA 121 is adjacent to ASPA 157, Backdoor Bay, which was proposed by New Zealand to protect Shackleton’s Hut.  The hut was first used by the British Antarctic Nimrod Expedition of 1907-1909.  The USAP visits the hut with permission from the NSF.  The hut is accessed by a trail near the boundary of ASPA 121.
Site Inspection
Three USAP inspection team members visited the site on 11 November 2015.   The ASPA was visited during an annual inspection of boundary signage and the historic hut at ASPA 157, prior to visitation from USAP and Antarctic New Zealand (AntNZ) program participants and science events.  Transport to the site was by helicopter.  The representatives accessed the Area by foot.  Ground time at the Area was approximately four hours.  The inspection team performed reconnaissance of the entire site. 
Key observations were:
    • GPS coordinates for various points in the ASPA were confirmed.
    • The boundary of ASPA 121 is marked regularly with signs, however there were boot tracks in the snow indicating that there may have been inadvertent entries into the ASPA on the way to the penguin-viewing overlook that is located outside the ASPA.
    • There are no boundary markers for ASPA 157.  Section 3 of the ASPA Management Plan indicates that flags should be placed on the sea-ice in Backdoor Bay, offshore from Derrick Point, to mark the boundary of the marine area on the first visit and removed on the last visit.  The sea ice was melted out at Cape Royds at the time of the visit, so it was not clear whether flags had been placed.
    • Helicopter landing pads were not marked with brightly coloured markers, as specified in Section 3 of the Management Plan.
    • An attempt was made to locate the Shackleton’s Depot identified on the ASPA maps.  GPS coordinates in the ASPA Management Plan indicate that the depot was located at the base of a small cliff near the shore and buried in snow.  Visual identification of the depot was not made.  
Human Activity
The Cape Royds area is visited by researchers, staff from nearby stations, and non-governmental visitors.  Those authorized to enter the ASPA for research or management purposes do so with a permit.  Monitoring of the penguin colony is conducted by U.S. researchers who camp outside the ASPA and enter on foot. 
Management activities aimed at protecting the values of the Area include the monitoring of the numbers of people entering the ASPA on an annual basis by the New Zealand and U.S. programs.
Recommendations
    • The boundary of ASPA 121 is marked regularly with signs, however an area near the penguin viewing area outside the ASPA was identified as requiring additional signage in order to avoid unintentional ASPA entry. As part of the management of the ASPA, a sign was added in the 2015-2016 season after discussions the USAP and AntNZ. 
    • Regularly used entry points to the ASPA should be marked with clear signage, including some detail on site guidelines. 
    • Increased and replacement signage could be considered for the adjacent ASPA 157, Backdoor Bay.

Inspection report: ASPA 122: Arrival Heights, Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island
Introduction
The area was originally designated as SSSI No. 2 (1975) on the grounds that it was “an electromagnetic and natural ‘quiet site’ offering ideal conditions for the installation of sensitive instruments for recording minute signals associated with upper atmosphere programs” as stated in the ASPA Management Plan at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/att473_e.pdf.  A five-year review with a revised Management Plan was submitted to CEP XIX (ATCM XXXIX WP 3); this includes updated maps and science programs planned for the site.
The instruments that measure local fields, including geomagnetic field sensors and very low frequency receivers, are sensitive to perturbations that propagate from remote generation regions. Apart from natural sources, there are sources of radio noise detected both within the Area itself and outside the Area. The VLF antennas are located in the crater of the larger cone, which provides shielding from local radio transmissions and station noise, but does not provide shielding from wind turbine noise.
Despite increased electromagnetic interference, scientific research at Arrival Heights can operate with “acceptably low levels” of disturbance.  The elevated position and broad horizon and the close proximity to support continue to provide value for upper atmospheric studies and air sampling studies. 
Site Inspection
A USAP inspection team member visited the site on 16 February 2016 with USAP lab technicians by vehicle from McMurdo Station.  Lab technicians enter the ASPA on a daily basis to maintain the equipment.  Inspection of the USAP laboratory building and the area surrounding the buildings was performed by vehicle and on foot.
Key observations were:
    • Researchers stated that the wind turbines cause interference for some of the data being collected.  Data from instrumentation in the “second crater” has shown this interference. 
    • Signs indicating the boundary of the Area with clear statements of entry restriction are placed along the access road from McMurdo station.
    • The USAP lab technician keeps a log of USAP participants to the ASPA and liaises with New Zealand researchers that work within the ASPA.  Antarctica New Zealand keeps a similar log of those who enter the ASPA.
    • The Area continues to be of high scientific value for a variety of high quality and long-term atmospheric data sets that have been collected at this site.  
    • The system of USAP participants entering the ASPA along with the lab technician appeared to work effectively.  It provided a means of ensuring compliance with the Management Plan and minimal disturbance to the instrumentation within the ASPA.  
    • McMurdo Station operations and the wind turbines between McMurdo and Scott Base have impacted some of the initial values due to radio frequency interference.
    • All waste, sewage and grey water generated at the research facilities are returned to either Scott Base or McMurdo Station.
Human Activity
Scientists and technicians from both the New Zealand and United States access the Area year-round to maintain the scientific equipment in the ASPA.  In addition, operational support staff from McMurdo Station and Scott Base enter the ASPA to maintain roads, towers, and other infrastructure.  Accidental entry into the area is possible if signs, roads and trails in the area of the ASPA are not maintained and clearly marked.    
Recommendations
    • Despite the acknowledged potential for interference from surrounding sources, the long-term data series, the accessibility of the site for year-round observations and its geographical advantages warrant continued protection of the area.
    • Arrival Heights ASPA values should be addressed during any adjacent station infrastructure improvements.  
    • Signs should be replaced on a regular basis due to wind ablating the reflective cover.  Signs with ASPA management guidelines designed to minimize disturbance from radio use and vehicle lights should be visible during the entire year.
    • Visits to the site should only be made for compelling scientific research that cannot be undertaken elsewhere and will not jeopardize the values of the Area, or its pristine value and potential as a reference site; and essential management activities, including maintenance, monitoring and inspection.

Inspection report: ASPA 123: Barwick and Balham Valley, Southern Victoria Land
Introduction
The Barwick and Balham Valleys are located within Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land, Ross Sea. The Barwick and Balham Valleys are rarely visited and are an important reference area for comparing changes in other Dry Valley ecosystems that are regularly visited for scientific purposes. Some of the best examples of the physical surface features, microbial life, lichens, and soil and lake microflora are found on the valley floors.
An area of Barwick Valley, including part of adjacent Balham Valley, was originally designated after a proposal by the United States on the grounds that it was “one of the least disturbed and contaminated of the Dry Valleys of Victoria Land” as stated in the Management Plan found at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/Att516_e.pdf.  It was also important as a reference against which to measure changes in comparable Dry Valleys ecosystems where scientific investigations are regularly conducted. 
USAP science events rarely obtain permits to enter the site.  An NSF-funded environmental monitoring research team visited the site in November 2015.  Previous visits were made by Antarctica New Zealand in 2008 for a Management Plan review and in 2012 to map distribution of soils in the area, which identified residual foot prints, prints from helicopter skids, and overturned rocks from campsites used in the area along the western portion of Lake Vashka.
Site Inspection
A three-member USAP inspection team including two NSF staff accessed the Area on 22 January 2016, by helicopter.  There is currently no designated helicopter landing area listed in the Management Plan, since science group members usually enter on foot, therefore a prior landing site near the western edge of Lake Vashka was reused.  Given the biological and geological sensitivities of the area, the inspection team maintained close proximity to the helicopter landing area to minimize disturbance to the area. The area was inspected for past activity.  Following the flyover of the Victoria Valley Lower site, the Inspection Team flew along the base of Webb Glacier to determine if bamboo poles, reported in 1993, were still visible along the snout of the glacier. The Inspection team exited the Barwick Valley ASPA Area, following a flyover of Parker Mesa. Helicopter landing and camping locations outside ASPA 123 in McKelvey Valley were not inspected.  Approximate ground time in the ASPA was 2 hours.
Key observations were:
    • There is currently no designated helicopter landing area within the Management Plan for ASPA 123.  Further, previously used helicopter-landing areas at Victoria Valley sites within the ASPA were not identifiable or were deemed unsafe for landing. 
    • Evidence of past activities at the site appear to have been successfully removed by an earlier clean-up effort by Antarctica New Zealand.  The bamboo poles, previously reported to be on the Webb Glacier, were not visible during this inspection.
Human Activity
In order to keep the Area as ‘one of the least disturbed and contaminated of the Dry Valleys of Victoria Land’ permits are rarely issued.  An NSF-funded environmental monitoring research team collected soil samples during the 2015-2016 season from sites of previous activity within the ASPA.  
Recommendations
    • Consider identifying a helicopter landing location(s) within Barwick Valley to be used only for purposes allowed for by the ASPA Management Plan in order to minimize impacts to Area.
    • Continued management of Area by limiting activities in the area to research that cannot be conducted elsewhere and essential management activities aimed at continuing to protect the values of the ASPA.

Inspection Report: ASPA 124: Cape Crozier, Ross Island 
Introduction
The Cape Crozier Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) is located at the eastern extremity of Ross Island, Ross Sea and encompasses approximately 70 km² of land and surrounding sea.  The Area was originally designated as Specially Protected Area No. 6 in 1966 based on a proposal by the United States stating “that the region supports a rich bird and mammal fauna as well as microfauna and microflora, and that the ecosystem depends on a substantial mixing of marine and terrestrial elements of outstanding scientific interest.”  The site was renamed and renumbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 124 by Decision 1 (2002). The original boundaries were extended south to include Igloo Spur and to protect the range of vegetation assemblages representative of the Cape Crozier region and Wilson’s Igloo as stated in the Management plan found at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/Att543_e.pdf.  This boundary was further simplified in the 2014 Management Plan update, now following a line directly between the summits of Bomb Peak and Post Office Hill, and adjusted to exclude the Cape Crozier hut from the Area.  This allows for entry to the hut without the need for a permit.
Site Inspection
On 24 November 2015, two USAP inspection team members visited Cape Crozier for the ASPA inspection.  Transport to the site was by helicopter, using a landing site outside of the ASPA.  The representatives accessed the site by foot.  Ground time at the Area was approximately eighteen hours.  The inspection team performed reconnaissance of the entire site and attempted to inspect key features of the ASPA.  
On 26 November 2015, one USAP inspection team member along with a NSF-supported artist visited Wilson’s Igloo.  The artist visited in order to take pictures of the historic igloo, while the USAP inspection member determined if the helicopter-landing site was appropriately marked and determined if any signage was necessary.  Transport to the site was by helicopter.  The representatives accessed the site by foot.  Ground time at the Area was approximately thirty minutes.  
During the inspection, the ASPA signs were replaced for the season, according to the accepted practice by national programs in the area.  The boundaries of the relatively large ASPA were inspected, to the extent possible.  
Key observations were:
    • GPS coordinates for various points in the ASPA were confirmed.
    • A piece of equipment that is used annually by a science group was found stored on the ground within the Adelie penguin colony, not far from the point where the penguins access the sea ice.  
    • Steep snow-fields, ice, and a significant distance separate the southern portion from the northern portion of the ASPA (where the Adelie penguin colony and research hut are located).  The southern area of the ASPA was not inspected during the 24 November visit.  
    • The GPS waypoint for the igloo taken in the field is different from that listed on the map in the ASPA Management Plan.  
    • A partial path from the hut leading toward the northern portion of the ASPA is shown on the Management Plan.  This corresponds to the most apparent path from the hut toward the northern portion of the ASPA.  Within 0.5 km or less from the hut, the path becomes hard to distinguish, particularly on the return from the ASPA to the hut.   
Human activity
USAP scientific research groups and artistic participants camped near the APSA in 2015-2016 and had permits for entry into the ASPA.  Management activities for the ASPA include monitoring the number of people who enter the ASPA on an annual basis.
Recommendations
    • Consider removing signs from posts at the end of each season to protect them from ablation over the winter and replacing the signs at the start of the following season.  The posts and the post top pieces could be left out over winter without significant risk of degradation.  
    • To protect lichen growing outside of the ASPA, rock cairns or other appropriate markings could be placed along a specified route to encourage the use of a consistent path from the hut to the ASPA.
    • Consider removal of scientific equipment during the period of the year in which the equipment is not actively used.
Inspection report: ASPA 139: Biscoe Point, Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago
Introduction
Biscoe Point is located on southwest Anvers Island within the Palmer Basin ASMA.  The primary reason for the designation of the Area is “its extensive vegetation communities, soils and terrestrial ecology” according to the Management Plan found at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/Att546_e.pdf.  The Area contains the most extensive stands of Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort in the Anvers Island region, as well as numerous species of mosses and lichens.  The Area is a breeding site for several bird species, including Adélie and gentoo penguins as well as brown, south polar, and hybrid skuas.  The flora and fauna of the Area has been used for long-term studies. The long history of protection makes the area an ideal reference area for Anvers Island flora and fauna
Site Inspection
A site inspection to the northern portion of the ASPA was performed by a USAP inspection team member on 26 February 2016.  The visit coincided with NSF-funded and permitted science research.  The northern landing location as seen on Map 2 of the ASPA Management Plan was accessed by two boats carrying the inspection team and the researchers.  Approximate ground time at the ASPA was four hours.
An additional visit to the southern portion of the ASPA was performed 2 on March 2016.  An USAP inspection team member accompanied penguin researchers for reconnaissance of the southern portion of the ASPA.   The site was accessed by small boat.  Approximate ground time at the ASPA was two hours.
Key observations were:
    • Bird researchers indicated that the helicopter landing and camping locations on the Management Plan map are not ideal.  They recommended considering a camping spot nearer to the southern boat landing.       
    • Researchers studying fauna on Biscoe Point did not identify any non-native species in the northern half of the ASPA near the study area. 
    • Penguins and seals were present in the northern portion of the ASPA during the 26 February inspection, but they did not appear to be affecting the local flora.  
    • Gentoo penguin populations have increased in the southern portion of the ASPA, destroying much of the moss and grass flora in that area.  Little vegetation was present in the southern portion of the ASPA.  
    • Freshwater ponds that may have been used as drinking water in the past are currently surrounded by a Gentoo penguin colony and would not be suitable as a source of potable water.  
    • The Management Plan indicates that welding rods were used as markers and may be impacting the flora.  A welding rod was identified, but extensive damage to the local flora was not apparent.  
Human Activity
Human activity is limited, but penguin researchers visit the Area annually to assess penguin colonies.   Researchers also visited the site during the 2015-2016 season to assess local fauna.
Management activities include limiting visits protect the flora at the site, while allowing visits for education, outreach, and essential management activities, including monitoring and inspection.
Recommendations
    • Consider updating the Management Plan maps, including potential camping sites, during the next Management Plan review.
    • Management of Area by limiting activities in the area to research that cannot be conducted elsewhere and critical management activities should continue to protect the values of the ASPA.   
Inspection report: ASPA 149: Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Island, Livingston Islands, South Shetland Islands
Introduction
The Area protects large and diverse bird and seal populations that are the subject of long-term scientific monitoring. The Area contains the largest Antarctic fur seal breeding colony in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Values protected under the original designation include a wide range of flora and fauna, including invertebrates, penguins, southern elephant seals, and Antarctic fur seals.  Designation was on the grounds that the “presence of both Antarctic fur seal and penguin colonies, and of krill fisheries within the foraging range of these species, make this a critical site for inclusion in the ecosystem monitoring network being established to help meet the objectives of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources as noted in the Management Plan found at http://www.ats.aq/documents/recatt/Att275_e.pdf.  Long-term studies continue to assess and monitor the survival, feeding ecology, growth, condition, reproduction, behaviour, vital rates, and abundance of pinnipeds and seabirds that breed within the Area. 
Site Inspection
A USAP inspection team member performed a site inspection on 26 October 2015 during the permitted, annual research camp installation in the ASPA.  A significant amount of snow covered the ASPA.  Approximate time at the ASPA was two hours.  A second visit was conducted on 19 March 2016 during the annual removal of the research camp.  Approximate time at the ASPA was two hours.
Key observations were:
    • General values for birds and seals remain unchanged.  No breeding leopard seals have been identified on the island. 
    • A sign at Modulo Beach broke last season and has not been replaced.  
    • The Seal Tracking Receiving Station has moved to the west of Mansa Bay.
    • The seal colonies on the eastern side of the island have expanded to include adjacent areas.
Human Activity
Human activity at the site includes:
    • Continued long-term ecosystem monitoring as part of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP).  
    • Other research that cannot be undertaken elsewhere and will not jeopardize the values of the Area, or its pristine value and potential as a reference site.
    • Essential management activities, including monitoring and inspection.
    • Twice annual visits by USAP personnel on the R/V Laurence M. Gould to aid in the installation and removal of the annual CEMP research camp.  All activities are in support of science, permitted, and reported. 
Recommendations
    • Consider updating the Management Plan maps with proper rectification and to reflect the current boundaries of seal colonies, the current location of the Seal Tracking Receiving Station, and trails.
    • A sign indicating that the island is protected and requires special permitting had been placed on the south end of the island and should be replaced.
