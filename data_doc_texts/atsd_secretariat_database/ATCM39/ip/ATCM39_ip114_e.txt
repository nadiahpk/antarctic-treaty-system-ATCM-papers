Areas of tourist interest in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region. 2015/2016 austral summer season
Summary
This paper presents a report on the distribution of tourist visits to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region according to the voyages made by vessels during the 2015/2016 summer season, operating through the port of Ushuaia.
Introduction
Although Antarctica has consolidated as a tourist destination, it should be noted that most programs mainly market their voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula region. 
The Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands are considered as one single region, containing different areas of tourist interest. Our work has been undertaken on the basis of information provided by tour operators in their cruise ship manifests1 to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority), during the 2015/2016 season.In some cases, the information from these documents was completed with the itineraries published by tour operators.
During the analyzed season a total of 227 voyages were made to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region through the port of Ushuaia, run by 33 vessels. Of this total, 219 voyages corresponding to 28 vessels made landings. However, 175 manifests have informed of the voyage plan, that is to say, 80% of the itineraries planned by tour operators are available when vessels set sail. 
Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region and its areas of tourist interest
The Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands are defined as a region from the point of view of tourist visits, acknowledging in turn different areas on the basis of criteria such as geographical proximity and concentration of points of interest. The resulting areas are presented below (See table 1). 
    1) South Orkney Islands. 
    2) Elephant Island and adjacent islands.
    3) South Shetland Islands.
    4) Northeast of Antarctic Peninsula       
(Space between Gourdin Islets and Snow Hill Island, including Antarctic Sound and Weddell Sea towards the East).
    5) Northwest of Antarctic Peninsula.
(West coast of the Peninsula, along with the Bransfield Strait, between Gourdin Islets and Mikkelsen Harbour).
    6) Central-West of Antarctic Peninsula.
(Between Mikkelsen Harbour and Brown Station, practically including Palmer Archipelago, with Gerlache Strait). 
    7) Southwest of Antarctic Peninsula.
(Comprising the areas adjacent to Lemaire Channel and to Penola Strait, between Flandres Bay and Beascochea Bay, area of Bellingshausen Sea).
    8) Antarctic Polar Circle
(Spaces close to the parallel defining the Circle are considered, approximately from 66º 00’ S to 68º 11’ S, that is to say, between Prospect Point and Stonington Island respectively).

Visit areas/sites corresponding to these 8 geographic regions are listed in Annex 1.

Distribution of visits to different tourist sites according to voyage plans
Taking into account the voyage plan for each vessel at the time of departing, we found that the most visited areas in the region are the Central-West area and the South Shetland Islands are, concentrating the 93% and 90 %respectively, of the visits made to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region, followed by the Southwest area with 54 % and by the Northeast area with a 32%. The South Orkney Islands, Elephant Island and adjacent islands and Antarctic Polar Circle resulted the least frequented areas. In figure 1 the frequency corresponding to each area of visit is shown in percentages according to the 175 voyage plans that presented their itinerary, thus allowing comparison of the level of visits each area received.
In addition, within each area it is possible to identify the sites most frequently visited. In this regard, a figure is shown for each area highlighting the sites according to the number of voyages made to that location (See figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).

South Orkney Islands area
For South Orkney Islands, we found that Orcadas Station at Laurie Island and Monroe Island have been the visited sites. Nevertheless, 6 voyages were made to this area without detailing the site to visit (See figure 2). The inclusion of this area on the itineraries is related to voyages that, in general, visit other destinations located further North on the Atlantic Ocean and then go around South Shetland Islands and Northeast of Antarctic Peninsula areas (See table 2).

Elephant Island and adjacent islands area
The most prominent visit site on this area is Wild Point (Cabo Wild), mentioned on 21 voyage plans, whereas Lookout Cape (Cabo Vigilante) was only mentioned for 5 voyages. Besides, 8 voyage plans referred to Elephant Island without mentioning specific visit sites (See figure 3). As it can be seen from table 3, most voyages to this area were related to South Shetland Islands, Central-West and Northeast areas. This area does not have any Site Guidelines for Visitors2.

Together with the Central-West Antarctic Peninsula area, these are the most frequently visited areas with several visit sites totaling 16, as clearly shown by figure 4; Whalers Bay at Deception Island was mentioned on 96 voyage plans, reaching the highest number for this area. Half Moon Island is next in the visiting order. This area is closely linked to all others, revealing that one of its visit sites is included almost on every voyage (See table 4). Out of all the sites which were identified, 10 have Site Guidelines for Visitors: Turret Point, Penguin Island, Aitcho Islets, Yankee Harbour, Half Moon Island, Hannah Point, Telefon Bay, Whalers Bay Pendulum Cove and Bailey Head (Punta Rancho), which coincide with the most visited ones.

Northwest of Antarctic Peninsula area
The Northwest of the Peninsula presents only four visit sites, Mikkelsen Harbour, Spert Island, Astrolabe Island and Christiania Island, with 36, 4, 2 and 2 visits respectively (See figure 6). It is worth mentioning that visits to Mikkelsen Harbour are generally associated with Cierva Cove and Hydrurga Rocks which, for the purposes of this report, are part of Central-West Peninsula area. This area is associated more significantly with voyages to the South Shetland Islands, Central-West and Southwest areas (See Table 6). This area has 1 Site Guidelines for Visitors in the sector of Mikkelsen Harbour.

This is the most visited area. It also has the most visited site, with 99 voyages for Cuverville Island, followed by Goudier Island/Lockroy Port, Jougla Point and it also contains the highest number of sites mentioned on voyage plans for tourist visits, with 20 sites. Other sites with an important number of visits are Paradise Harbour and Brown Station/Skontorp Cove (See figure 7). Likewise, this area is strongly associated with the other visit areas (See table 7). Out of all the sites which were identified, just 7 have Site Guidelines for Visitors (Cuverville Island, Danco Island (Isla Dedo), Neko Harbour, Goudier Island/Port Lockroy, Jougla Point, Damoy Point and Orne Islands) while two stations (Palmer and Brown) have internal guidelines.

Over the last years vessels have sailed further South, including areas near the Antarctic Polar Circle. In this respect, for the analyzed season, 8 tourist visit sites were identified as mentioned on voyage plans. The most visited site is Detaille Island with 9 voyages, followed by Fish Islands (See Figure 9). Its association with other visit areas is more significant in the case of most frequently visited areas, namely, South Shetland Islands, Central-West and Southwest areas (See Table 9). In this area 3 of the mentioned sites have Site Guidelines for Visitors: Detaille Island, Horseshoe Island (Isla Herradura) and Stonington Island. Rothera station has internal guidelines in place.

Final considerations
From the analysis of voyage plans presented by tour operators for 2015/2016 season, 8 tourist visit areas were identified at the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region. Of these areas, the most frequented ones are Central-West Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands, followed by the Southwest area. Central-West area contains the most visited site, Cuverville Island. In South Shetland Islands is located the second most visited site, Whalers Bay. Likewise, Southwest area contains two important visit sites, Petermann Island and Pléneau Island, in the vicinity of Lemaire Channel. These 3 areas are, in turn, closely associated among them in connection with voyages combining these spaces. 
On the other hand, the Northeast area also includes a significant percentage of voyages, associated preferably with areas located to the North of the Peninsula, such as South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, Elephant Island and adjacent islands. In the Northwest area, visits concentrated in Mikkelsen Harbour, whereas the other sites were hardly frequented. South Orkney Islands, Elephant Island and adjacent islands and Antarctic Circle areas were the least visited by tourist voyages. 
Finally, out of a total number of 68 visit sites distributed in 8 areas, 29 have Site Guidelines for Visitors, coinciding with the most frequently visited places.
