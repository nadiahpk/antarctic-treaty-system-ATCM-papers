 	Implementation and compliance
4. 	The Commission approved the CCAMLR Compliance Report for 2015 – the third year of implementation of the CCAMLR Compliance Evaluation Procedure.
5. 	Other issues considered included:
    • The successful implementation of a vessel monitoring system in 2015 including the adoption of minimum standards for VMS units and an increase in the reporting frequency to hourly intervals to be implemented across all fisheries by 2019 
    • An outreach strategy to encourage non-Contracting Parties to cooperate with CCAMLR in the implementation of CCAMLR’s Catch Document Scheme for toothfish and CCAMLR’s on-going efforts to address illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities in the Convention Area
    • Agreement to provide details of ice classification of vessels with licence notifications
    • The successful implementation of an Arrangement for the release CCAMLR VMS data to all 5 MRCCs responsible for SAR in the Southern Ocean to support search and rescue (SAR) efforts in the CAMLR Convention Area (refer to previous discussions regarding SAR at ATCMXXXVI and ATCMXXXVII). 
    • That there was no CP-IUU Vessel List for 2015/16 and that no new vessels had been proposed for inclusion on the NCP-IUU Vessel List for 2015/16
    • The adoption of a Resolution concerning the operations of vessels without nationality in the Convention Area  
	Administration and Finance
6. 	The Commission supported further work to examine revenue generating opportunities and further reduce costs to secure sustainable funding.  It was noted that assessed contributions are expected to be maintained at zero real-growth for the period 2014-2018 subject to no unforeseen circumstances.
	Report of the Scientific Committee (a more detailed report that focuses on the five issues of common interest to the CEP and SC-CAMLR, as identified in 2009 at the joint CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop in Baltimore, will be presented to the CEP-XIX by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee Chair, Dr Mark Belchier (United Kingdom)). The CEP will also discuss the outcomes of the second CEP-SC-CAMLR Workshop which was convened in Punta Arenas immediately prior to ATCM-XXXVIII (19-20 May 2016).  Additional general matters considered by the Scientific Committee at its last meeting included:

Krill resources

7.	In relation to catches in the 2014/15 season, the preliminary total catch from Subarea 48.1, which was closed on 28 May 2015, was 154 001 tonnes (99% of the 155 000 tonne limit), from Subarea 48.2 it was 17 100 tonnes, and the catch from Subarea 48.3 was 54 364 tonnes. The catches in Subareas 48.2 and 48.3 were 6% and 19% of the respective catch limits for those subareas.
8.	Seven Members notified for 18 vessels to fish for krill in 2015/16 season. 
9. 	The Commission endorsed the advice from the Scientific Committee that the available indices of krill biomass in Area 48 show no evidence of a systematic change in krill biomass since 2000. The Scientific Committee advised that, as the trigger level is less than 2% of krill biomass estimated in any year between 2000 and 2011, the current trigger level is appropriate for achieving the Convention’s Article II objectives for the krill stock at the area scale but is not intended to manage localised fishery impacts on krill predators.
10. 	The Commission endorsed the Scientific Committee’s advice on the importance of facilitating fisheries-based research that contributes towards the development of feedback management (FBM), including fishery acoustics to help monitoring seasonal and monthly cycles in krill biomass. The Commission also endorsed the advice of the Scientific Committee on the importance of the use of CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) indices, fishery performance indices and data collected as part of the CCAMLR Scheme of International Scientific Observation (SISO) in the development FBM.
Fish resources
11.	In 2014/15, 13 Members fished for toothfish (Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and/or Antarctic toothfish (D. mawsoni)) in Subareas 48.3, 48.4, 48.6, 58.6, 58.7, 88.1 and 88.2 and Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2, 58.4.3a, 58.5.1 and 58.5.2; Members also conducted research fishing for Dissostichus spp. in the closed area of Subarea 48.2 and Division 58.4.4b. The reported total catch of Dissostichus spp. was 15 795 tonnes. In comparison, the total reported catch of toothfish in 2013/14 was 15 232 tonnes. 
12.	In 2015, as catch limits were reached, the Secretariat closed the fisheries for Dissostichus spp. in Subarea 48.4 on 22 April, Subarea 48.6 on 10 March, Subarea 88.1 on 1 February and Subarea 88.2 on 14 February 2015. There were also closures at the small-scale research unit (SSRU) level in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2. 
13.       The UK targeted mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in Subarea 48.3 (277t), Australia fished for this species in Division 58.5.2 (10t) and France fished for this species in Division 58.5.1 (178t). 

New and exploratory finfish fisheries 
14. 	Notifications for exploratory fisheries for Dissostichus spp. in 2015/16 were submitted by nine Members for a total of 18 vessels.  These notifications, catch limits (including for by-catch with associated move-on rules), and associated research and survey plans were endorsed by the Commission on the basis of advice provided by the Scientific Committee. 
Assessment and avoidance of incidental mortality
15. 	Following an analysis of bycatch data that revealed inconsistencies in reporting of non-target catch the Commission agreed that accurate by-catch data are fundamental to the Scientific Committee and the Commission in achieving the objectives of Article II of the Convention.
16. 	The Commission welcomed the advice that the number of seabird by-catch mortalities in 2014/15 was the lowest recorded since the beginning of seabird by-catch observations in the Convention Area.
Marine protected areas 
17.	The Commission welcomed the update on the preparatory work for the spatial planning of marine protected areas in (i) the Western Antarctic Peninsula–South Scotia Arc, (ii) the Weddell Sea, (iii) the East Antarctic Representative System of MPAs, and (iv) the Ross Sea Region.
Climate change 
18.	The Commission endorsed the Scientific Committee’s advice that it is vital to factor climate change considerations into its work to ensure that scientific studies are designed, and a time series built, to serve a scientific basis for long-term analysis supporting the implementation of CCAMLR management approaches, including FBM for krill.
19. 	The Commission agreed to Terms of Reference for an ICG to consider approaches for appropriately integrating climate change into the work of CCAMLR. 
Capacity building 
20.  	The Commission endorsed the advice of the Scientific Committee in relation to capacity building, including through the CCAMLR Scientific Scholarship Scheme and the invitation of observers and experts to the meetings of the Scientific Committee and its working groups.  Six Scholarships have now been awarded since the inception of the Scheme in 2010 – to recipients from Argentina, Chile, China, EU, Poland and Russia (although the Russian awardee has been unable to take up his scholarship at this time).
Conservation measures
21.	Conservation measures and resolutions adopted at CCAMLR-XXXIV have been published on the CCAMLR website (Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2015/16). 
Marine protected areas
22.	New Zealand and the USA introduced a revised proposal for the establishment of a Ross Sea Region MPA. Australia, France and the EU introduced a revised proposal to establish an East Antarctic Representative System of MPAs and the EU and Germany provided a status report on progress with the development of a proposal for a Weddell Sea MPA. The Commission also considered a proposal tabled by the EU and the UK to adopt a conservation measure to promote and facilitate scientific research in newly exposed marine areas following ice-shelf retreat or collapse around the Antarctic Peninsula. The Commission looked forward to further consideration of these proposals at future meetings of the Commission.  
Implementation of Convention objectives
CCAMLR Symposium
23.	At CCAMLR-XXXIII the Commission endorsed a proposal to hold a second CCAMLR Symposium to mark the 35th anniversary of the signing of the Convention. CCAMLR-XXXIV considered the outcomes of the symposium which was held 5- 8 May 2015 in Santiago, Chile. CCAMLR-XXXIV discussed outcomes relating to climate change, the relationship between the Commission and Scientific Committee, strategic priorities for the next five years, the relationship between conservation and rational use, maritime safety and the relationship between CCAMLR and other organisations with related interests, noting that CCAMLR is an integral part of the Antarctic Treaty System, with associated obligations to cooperate. 
Cooperation with Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties
24.	The Commission received reports relating to the outcomes of the 38th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  
25.	The Commission noted opportunities for engagement with COMNAP in 2016 in relation to the workshop on search and rescue which is scheduled to be held in association with ATCM XXXIX and the with the CEP in relation to the second CEP–SC-CAMLR Workshop which will take place 19-20 May 2016 at Punta Arenas, Chile.
