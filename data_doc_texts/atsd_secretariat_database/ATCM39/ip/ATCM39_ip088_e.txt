Antarctic Dialogues Chile-Bulgaria: Art and Culture

Information Paper submitted by Chile and Bulgaria.

The Chilean Antarctic Institute and the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute organized two activities jointly, related to the Art and Polar Culture, in the city of Punta Arenas. This was the result of the closest connection between these two Antarctic programs and the continuous information exchange of their activities on the White Continent.

In this sense, it emerged the possibility of mounting an exhibition of Bulgarian artistic works in Punta Arenas, that were destined to the Bulgarian Antarctic Station “St. Kliment Ohridski” on Livingston Island. This was complemented by the contribution of Chilean artists who made works inspired in Antarctica.

The exhibition "Antarctic Art of Bulgaria and Chile" took place at the workshop "La Galería", owned by artist Paola Vezzani (University of Magallanes, and Former Director of the Regional Council for Culture and the Arts) and it was open on January 15 and 16 in 2016. In the exhibition, works of "Eco Antarctica" (Bulgaria) and "Antarctic Bestiary" (Chile) were displayed.

The Bulgarian Antarctic Institute is actively working to bring Antarctica to a wider audience and, in this sense, have worked with the National School of Fine Arts "Ilia Petrov" in Sofia, one of the most famous art schools in Bulgaria. The project sought to combine the aesthetic possibilities of contemporary art with current issues relating to the environment and the influence of human factor. Over the past year, students and teachers of this school created artworks on the theme "Eco Antarctica"; the best works were displayed on Punta Arenas, before their trip to Antarctica.

On the other hand, the "Antarctic Bestiary" project, by Paola Vezzani and Oscar Barrientos, is a research funded by the National Fund for Culture and Arts of Chile. This research led to the creation of texts and sculptures from the mythological beings that populated the navigational charts in the past.




The same January 15 in the afternoon, at the Chilean Antarctic Institute headquarters, “Antarctic Dialogues Chile-Bulgaria: Art and Culture” was carried out, with the following program:

    • "Activities of the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute". Dragomir Mateev, Bulgarian Antarctic Institute. 
    • "Cultural activity of Bulgaria in Antarctica". Gergana Lapteva, Culture Department of the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute. 
    • "Antarctic and Sub-antarctic territory in artistic and cultural identity of Magellan". Luis Quilodrán, Regional Council for Culture and the Arts. 
    • "Chilean Art in Antarctica". Paola Vezzani, sculptor, University of Magallanes. 
    • Project "Antarctic Bestiary". Dr. Oscar Barrientos, writer, University of Magallanes.

These talks led to an interesting dialogue between speakers and the public, enriching the vision that it is possible to form about Antarctica and its importance for the whole society.



Both the Chilean Antarctic Institute and the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute are interested in continuing such activities, which, ultimately, take advantage of the many possibilities offered by the contact between National Antarctic Programs and the use of the same gateway to Antarctica, in this case, Punta Arenas.
