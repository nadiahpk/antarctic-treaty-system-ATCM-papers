Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in
Ushuaia during the 2015/2016 Austral summer season
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and
vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2015/2016 Austral
summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. Also, it
identifies the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called
at the port of Ushuaia, the number of voyages that took place,
passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per
vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South
America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of
Antarctic shipborne tourism, concentrating more than 90% of the
worldwide shipborne Antarctic tourist activity.
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has
contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in
addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic
Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend their Antarctic
operating schedules.
With respect to the vessels that operate from Ushuaia, a distinction
should be made between those that make landings and those of a
much larger size which just sail Antarctic waters without landing
passengers. Similarly, a further distinction should be made between
those vessels that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended
South American and Antarctic itinerary, and those which call in
Ushuaia as the port of base from which they run their Antarctic
voyages. As regards the latter case, operations carried out in
Ushuaia in general terms refer to passenger turnaround, port and
land services as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist
services. Finally, it should be noted that at the beginning and at the
end of the Antarctic tourist season most vessels arrive at the port of
Ushuaia and/or depart therefrom on a positioning voyage from or
towards other destinations.
In order to present the status of Antarctic tourist flows of visitors
and vessels in Ushuaia in the 2014/2015 season, data was collected
from the manifests It refers to the inbound and outbound clearance
documentation provided by the person in charge of the vessel.
provided by cruise ships to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine
Maritime Authority). This information was compared to itineraries
provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained
from enquiries whenever needed. With regard to these sources of
information a database is built for each Antarctic tourist season.
This document updates the data provided in similar papers
presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting since 2009, providing information that may contribute
with different aspects of discussions related to the Antarctic tourism
issue.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that
operated through Ushuaia during the 2015/2016 Austral summer
season
Austral summer season started on October 23rd when the MV
AkademikIoffe (One Ocean Expeditions) departed from Ushuaia to
Antarctica, and finished on April 3rd with the arrival of the MV
Ushuaia
(Antarpply Expeditions). A total of 2272 Some voyages were
cancelled due to technical problems or incidents, bad weather
conditions and commercial issues. voyages run by 33 vessels took
place, including smaller ones like the MY Hanse Explorer, SV Bark
Europa, MY Enigma XK and MYVava II. These last vessels are
included given the fact that they also moor at the commercial pier
of Ushuaia. January was the busiest month as regards the number
of Antarctic voyages (29 %) followed by December (See Figure 1).

A total of 38.848 visitors went to Antarctica through Ushuaia
during the 2015/2016 season. Of these, three categories may be
identified: a) those that both departed from and returned to the port
of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia
-that is to say, passengers who were in Ushuaia once either on
arrival or departure- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on
their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at
other ports (See Table 1). In the first case (a), passengers were
counted only upon departure from Ushuaia. In the second case (b),
several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other
ports, and some visited Antarctica as part of the voyage of the
beginning or end of the season, and then operated from Ushuaia the
rest of the time; in this instance the passengers who arrived at or
departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account. Finally,
in the last case (c), the vessels in transit that travelled to the
Antarctic Peninsula as part of a longer voyage in South America or
a more extensive itinerary. Passengers in transit were counted upon
arrival or departure, depending on the case when calling at the port
of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. A
distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Measure 15
(2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
Therefore, taking into account the average number of passengers on
board, it is noticed that 28 vessels were cruise ships that carried up
to 500 or fewer passengers whereas 5 vessels carried more than 500
passengers. The latter category transported a total of 8.807
passengers, representing the 22,67% of the total of passengers who
visited Antarctica through Ushuaia. An average number of crew
members and passengers The average number of passengers on
board is taken into account -not the capacity of the vessel, because
in some cases it could be that vessels transport a smaller number of
passengers than their total capacity. as well as the number of
voyages per vessel are presented in Table 2; and in Figure 2
passenger averages per vessel are shown.

With regard to vessels in transit in Ushuaia, most of them are large
cruise ships, which cruise Antarctic waters but do not make
passenger landings in Antarctica. As previously stated, these cruise
ships are on itineraries round southern South America or on more
extensive voyages, and on certain itineraries, they include a visit to
Antarctica. Most of these cruise ships run “pendular” voyages along
Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans and visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the
Pacific. Table 3 provides an overview of these cruise ships through
Ushuaia including the number of crew and passengers per voyage
and indicating if the visit to Antarctica was before or after the port
call in Ushuaia.
Furthermore, 20 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica
operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account
for 61 % of the total number of vessels which were analized. Each
of these vessels made between 7 and 15 voyages to Antarctica, as
indicated in Figure 3. It is worth noting that the MV Ocean Nova
(Antarctica XXI), MV Polar Pioneer (Aurora Expeditions), MV Sea
Adventurer (Quark Expeditions), MV Akademik Sergey Vavilov
(OneOceanExpeditions) and MV Sea Explorer I (Polar Latitudes),
had a different deployment in December, January and February,
when they also conducted voyages from 25 de Mayo Island,
embarking passengers whose arrivals and departures were from
Punta Arenas (Chile) by airplane. The motor yachts Hanse Explorer
and Enigma XK had a similar way of operation.

As regards visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of
Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers were noted. In this respect,
more than 76 nationalities were identified. Most of the passengers
are from the United States, followed by China, Australia, United
Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Switzerland, Japan,
Netherlands and New Zealand, among others. Percentages are
presented in Figure 4.
With regard to Measure 15 (2009), adopted at the XXXII Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one
guide every 20 passengers, we have identified expedition staff
members who were included either on the crew or on the passenger
lists. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, staff members
perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides
and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the
landing activities. Only staff members on board vessels that carry
up to 500 passengers have been considered. In most voyages,
expedition staff is not specified, in second place they are included in
the passenger manifest and, in third place, they are included in the
crew manifest; in some cases they are listed on both (See Table 4).
In this respect, it is worth mentioning that their position on board is
stated only when they are on the crew manifest.

According to the registers of vessels that operated in Antarctica
throughout this season from Ushuaia, we observed, on the one
hand, that among the States of register of those vessels, 5 are
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (France, Netherlands, Norway,
Russian Federation) and United Kingdom [Cayman Islands]) and,
on the other hand, 7 are not an Antarctic Treaty Party (Antigua and
Barbuda, Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia, Malta, Marshall Islands and
Union of Comoros) (See Figure 5).

Concluding remarks
The information presented in this document contributes to identify
the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the
port of Ushuaia in the 2015/2016 summer season, the number of
voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average
number of crew per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of
ships.
In comparison with the last season hardly any variations are
observed. The total number of passengers who visited Antarctica
through Ushuaia increased 1,06%, during the 2015/2016 season.
The number of vessels also increased in five (including 2 luxury
yachts), without taking into account the vessel Le Boreal that
canceled her operations after she had an incident during the first
voyage of the season. Vessels that carried more than 500 passengers
were 5, which carried 8.807 passengers corresponding to 8voyages,
showing a difference of 680 passengers less compared to the last
season.
The data herein presented is a source of information that aims to
contribute, as alternative and supplementary data to currently
available sources, in the assessment of ship-borne tourism in the
Antarctic Peninsula region, with special emphasis on those tourist
vessels that call at the port of Ushuaia.
