Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2015-2016 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM information on IAATO operator landing site and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines use. This information paper presents the data collected by IAATO from IAATO member Post Visit Report Forms for the 2015-2016 season. No non-IAATO visits are included in this analysis.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found in ATCM XXXVIX IPxx IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism2015/16 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2016/17 and on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).
Antarctic Peninsula traditional ship-borne tourism 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, which accounts for circa 95% of all landed activity.  
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). As all traditional commercial ship-borne tourism with landings to the Peninsula during the 2015-16 season was conducted by IAATO member operators, it is believed that this information is reflective of actual levels of this activity.

Comparing the 2015-16 season with the peak season of 2007-2008, the following trends are visible:
    • Since 2011-2012 there has been a recovery in the number of passengers taking part in traditional ship borne tourism to the Peninsula since the retraction following the global recession in 2008. This growth has been variable, however the total number of passengers from ships making landings in the Antarctic Peninsula in 2015-16 (29,493) is now approaching the 2007-08 peak (31,352).  In part this is due to the increased number of voyages (see below) but also as the ships now operating have an increased capacity. 
    • Following the steady decline in IAATO ships operating in the area, from 33 in 2007-08 to only 20 in the 2011-12 season, there has been a slight resurgence with 25 SOLAS passenger vessels making landings in the Peninsula in the 2015-16 season. 
    • The most notable increase has taken place in the number of voyages (from 202 in 2012-13, to 225 in 2014-15, and now reaching 236 during the 2015-16 season) The previous peak in 2007/08 totalled 247 voyages. This is reflective of the increase in air/cruise tourism which negates the need for four to five days per voyage outside Antarctic Treaty waters to facilitate passenger turnarounds and accounts for the increase in the number of passengers. 
    • There was, however virtually no increase in the number of landings made from last season (2204 to 2206). This is believed to be due to the heavy ice conditions encountered in the first half of the season. 
    • There was no change in the number of landing sites used.

Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Tables 1 illustrates the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made for the 2015-16 season. The top twenty most visited sites accounted for circa 63% of the landings, with the top twenty five landing sites accounting for just under 70% of the landings. These relatively high percentages, though very slightly down from previous years continue to indicate that the trend of landings concentrating at a few popular sites remains strong. See also ATCM XXXIX IP XX Patterns of Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula Region: A 20-year analysis.
All of these most-visited sites are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or National Program management through their proximity to stations. 
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula in the 2015-16 season. Landings took place in the Antarctic Treaty Area from 4 November 2015 – 30 March 2016 (a total of 147 days). This is considerably less than the peak of 174 days in the 2007/08 season. (The extended season was largely due to the operation of the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov making early season visits to emperor penguin colonies.) 
The core period for visitation by ships was 95 days between early December to early March. On the basis of the full season dates, only Goudier Island received an average of more than one visit per day and five sites (Cuverville Island, Neko Harbour, Whalers Bay, Half Moon Island and Jougla Point) received an average of more than one visit per day during the core season.
Additional tourism statistics can be found on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).

Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines 
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and an analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms.  Appendix 3 illustrates the total number of known landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met. 

Co-ordination among IAATO field staff remains very effective. Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates that the daily limits set in the site guidelines were honoured, with no exceptions, during the 2015-16 season.
Conclusion
While the decline of tourism seems to be stabilising, the information extracted from the Post Visit Report Forms shows that overall tourism levels are still depressed from the peak season of 2007-08, but recovering. The increase in air/cruise tourism however, has resulted in a disproportional increase in the numbers of passengers and voyages but not to the number of landings made. 
All the landing sites in the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Programme Management guidelines. 
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP and ATCM on its members’ activities. In addition, IAATO Members remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
