Russian initiative on declaring 2020 the Year of Antarctica
Submitted by Russian Federation
The beginning of 2020 will mark the 200th anniversary from the moment in late January 1820 when seamen of the Russian South-Polar Expedition on the sloops “Vostok” and “Mirny” under the command of F.F. Bellingshausen and M.P. Lazarev, British Expedition on the ship “Williams” commanded by E. Bransfield and the US seal hunter N. Palmer on the sloop “Hero” saw for the first time in different places the shores of the unknown sixth continent. Due to quite clear reasons, the scale of this geographical discovery was assessed many years after. Numerous marine expeditions of the XIX and early XX centuries contributed to this. In 1886, a British oceanographer John Murray at the session of the Scottish Royal Geographical Society presented a chart with materials of ship expeditions in the XIX century to the southern polar latitudes and outlined contours of the unknown ice continent. As proposed by John Murray, it was called Antarctica. 
For the past two centuries from the day of the first heroic voyages among ice and icebergs of the southern polar waters, the international Antarctic community has reached a high level of knowledge about the peculiarities of nature of the Antarctic and factors determining its variability. This progress of knowledge was facilitated by implementation of large international projects among which one should mention the Second and Third International Polar Years (1932–1933, 2007–2008) and the International Geophysical Year of 1957–1958 and advanced technologies of studies and especially application of satellite data, which were inaccessible to mankind at the beginning of the XIX century. At the same time the Antarctic remains to be one of the least investigated regions of our planet, attracting therefore new generations of investigators of different countries. An interest in the Antarctic also increases among wide masses of population of our planet, some representatives of which strive to visit this severe and hostile area.
The aforementioned facts draw attention of the governments of the leading Antarctic nations not only in terms of extending scientific studies of this region but also for developing popular knowledge about it. This fact has served as a basis for the initiative of the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment to declare 2020 as the Year of Antarctica. This initiative was supported by leadership of the Russian Federation. With the aim of implementing this proposal, the Draft Plan of Events of the Year of Antarctica in the Russian Federation was developed. It includes projects on:
    • reconstruction and upgrading of infrastructure of the Russian Antarctic stations Vostok, Mirny, Bellingshausen and Russkaya;
    • carrying out nature protection measures at the seasonal field base Molodezhnaya;
    • design and construction of a new research-expedition vessel for the Russian Antarctic Expedition;
    • organization of publications on the history of the Russian (Soviet) Antarctic studies in the Russian and non-Russian mass media;
    • preparation of a series of scientific-popular and documentary films on the history of the Russian/Soviet studies of the Antarctic;
    • holding in Russia an international conference “History of discovery, study and exploration of the Antarctic from XIX to XXI century”;
    • holding an international scientific-practical conference “Results and perspectives of development of scientific research at the Russian Antarctic Vostok station”;
    • carrying all-Russia competitions among senior high school students, students of universities, young scientists and school teachers “History and current studies of the Antarctic” with organization of the trip of winners of competitions to Antarctica to one of the Russian stations;
    • preparation and carrying of a mobile round-the-world e-exhibition devoted to the 200th anniversary of discovery of Antarctica by the Russian South-Polar Expedition under the command of F.F. Bellingshausen and M.P. Lazarev in 1819–1821;
    • organization and carrying of the exhibition of pieces of art, items and documents from the collections of Russian museums “Russia in the epoch of great geographical discoveries”;
    • preparation and carrying of the exhibition of photo- and documentary films “Exploration of the Antarctic 1920–2020”;
    • organization and carrying of the competition of sketches and models of the monument to commemorate the 200th anniversary of discovery of Antarctica by the Russian South-Polar Expedition under the command of F.F. Bellingshausen and M.P. Lazarev in 1819–1821;
    • organization and carrying of the children drawing contest devoted to discovery and study of Antarctica;
    • publication of scientific-historical and scientific-popular books in honor of the 200th anniversary of discovery of Antarctica;
    • holding in Russia of the international forum “Days of the Arctic and the Antarctic”;
    • holding a ceremonial meeting and a conference devoted to the 200th anniversary of discovery of Antarctica by the Russian South-Polar Expedition under the command of F.F. Bellingshausen and M.P. Lazarev in 1819–1821;
    • organization of international comprehensive exchange cultural-historical projects devoted to discovery of the sixth continent.
Taking into account an enormous historical-geographical and political importance of the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica, the Delegation of the Russian Federation encourages all participants of the XXXIX ATCM to join the proposal for declaring 2020 the Year of Antarctica and take part in preparation and holding special arrangements on the occasion of this outstanding event.
