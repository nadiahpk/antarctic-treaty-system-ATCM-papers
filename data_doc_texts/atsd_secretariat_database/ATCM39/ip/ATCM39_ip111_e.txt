Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan








Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan
On 27 April 2016 the Australian Government released its Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan (the Strategy and Action Plan). The Strategy and Action Plan sets out Australia’s Antarctic interests and Australia’s vision for future engagement in Antarctica. The accompanying Action Plan covers a 20 year period and details the steps the Government will take to fulfil the Strategy. 
In its Strategy and Action Plan, the Australian Government has clearly reiterated its strong commitment to the Antarctic Treaty system. Key deliverables in the Strategy and Action Plan are:
    • A new world-class research and resupply Antarctic icebreaker.
    • New and stable funding to support an active Australian Antarctic programme.
    • Establish Australia’s position of science leadership in Antarctica through:
        ◦ developing modern and flexible infrastructure, including
            ▪ restoring traverse capabilities and establishing mobile stations in the Antarctic interior
            ▪ further scoping options for expanded aviation capabilities to establish a year-round aviation capability between Hobart and Antarctica
            ▪ progressing options for more efficient and flexible use of existing research stations
    • a revitalised science programme, including
            ▪ coordinated and effective funding of Antarctic science
            ▪ opportunities for public-private partnerships to conduct new and iconic scientific research endeavours 
        ◦ greater collaboration and cooperation with other states active in East Antarctica.
    • Support a robust and effective Antarctic Treaty system, and continue to build strong and effective relationships with other Antarctic Treaty Parties.
    • Build Tasmania’s status as the premier East Antarctic Gateway for science and operations, including through:
        ◦ streamlined Government regulatory and approval processes to facilitate increased use of Hobart as an Antarctic Gateway port
        ◦ agreeing priority proposals with industry to enhance Tasmania’s status as an Antarctic Gateway, including expanded infrastructure in Hobart for the new icebreaker
        ◦ a major review on building research infrastructure in Hobart to establish Australia as the world’s leader in krill research.
The Strategy and Action Plan highlights that Australia:
    • welcomes international engagement in Antarctica, consistent with the Antarctic Treaty system and its key principles for the governance of the region, including those enshrined in Articles I, II, III, IV, V & VII of the Treaty
    • looks forward, together with all Antarctic Treaty Parties, to celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the signing of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and its comprehensive environmental protection regime, including the prohibition on any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research
    • is committed to continuing to advocate for best-practice environmental stewardship, comprehensive environmental protection and ecosystem conservation in Antarctica.
