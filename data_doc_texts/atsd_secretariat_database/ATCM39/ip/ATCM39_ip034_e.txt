The Antarctic Observing Network (AntON) to facilitate weather and climate information








The Antarctic Observing Network (AntON) to facilitate weather and climate information
Introduction
Antarctica is a very data sparse area of the world and so it is important to maximise use of all of the meteorological and other data that are collected there for weather, climate and other research and operational activities. These data are useful for both the Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) and for the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP – see separate IP 15). However, the density of the current surface and upper-air stations is much less than that desirable to properly characterize Antarctic weather and climate.
Both WMO (through its Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar and High Mountain Observations, Research and Services and its Antarctic Task Team) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) through its Expert Group on Operational Meteorology in the Antarctic aim to maximise the dissemination and use of such data through the Antarctic Observing Network (AntON). 

The Antarctic Observing Network (AntON)
AntON consists of manned and automatic weather stations currently in operation in Antarctica and the sub Antarctic islands. The current list (as of end Feb. 2016) is provided in Appendix 1 and is also available online (see below). The network distribution is updated on a regular basis when new details about stations are received (e.g. new installations, removals or failures). A subset of AntON makes up the Antarctic part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Surface Network (GSN). The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) carries out the GCOS monitoring for Antarctica and is also registered as a Data Collection or Production Centre for Antarctica under the auspices of the WMO Information System (WIS). Details about the monitoring can be found on the monitoring page at http://tinyurl.com/j7f5okr. This site also contains resources for national operators to see the quantity and quality of their observations and also links to online resources.
Using AntON is a way of ensuring people know of the sites where data are available, but it does rely on national operators making WMO aware of any new installations or sites that are no longer functioning. 
In addition to keeping a list of the operational meteorological sites in Antarctica, WMO and SCAR, through BAS also monitor the meteorological reports from ships that are operating in Antarctic waters (see Appendix 2). All ships operating in Antarctic waters are encouraged to make meteorological observations and then to transmit them on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) to make them available through the WMO Information System. More details about doing this can be found in the ships section of the monitoring page.
Aircraft operating in Antarctica are asked by the WMO to provide meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. If an aircraft is fitted with Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) capability, the system will automatically compile and transmit aircraft meteorological observations over Antarctica. National operators are asked to ensure that all Aircraft Reports generated for aviation purposes that contain meteorological information, including over Antarctica, are sent to one of the International Civil Aviation Organisation World Areas Forecast Centres (WAFCs) so that they can be compiled into bulletins and transmitted1. 
At present information (metadata) about AntON is only reflected in a list of sites where meteorological data are collected but in future it will also include additional metadata, such as which parameters are recorded at a site, how long they have been measured and if they are manual or automated observations. These metadata will follow the WMO Integrated Global Observing Systems Metadata Standard (WMDS) defined in the WIGOS Manual2 and will be available via the OSCAR database (oscar.wmo.int) of the WMO. The need for such metadata was highlighted in the Outcomes of the Intersessional Contact Group on Information Exchange Requirements at ATCM 383 

Recommendations
Noting in particular the outcomes of the Intersessional Contact Group on Information Exchange Requirements, WMO and SCAR recommend that Treaty Parties:
1.     Note the need for the Antarctic Observing Network (AntON) and its associated metadata in accordance with WMO practices4 
2.     Notify the AntON (AntON@wmo.int) if there are any changes regarding stations/platforms in the Antarctic region where meteorological data are collected
3.     Provide to the AntON (AntON@wmo.int) whenever possible the metadata concerning which information is collected at each site or ship that relates to meteorology and related (e.g. snow depth) data
4.     Ensure aircraft operating in Antarctica provide meteorological observations, either through AMDAR or by compiling such information into bulletins and transmitting them to their local WMO Information System/GTS centre.

Appendix 1
WMO Antarctic Observing Network (AntON)

This list shows the stations currently comprising the Antarctic Observing Network (AntON). It shows whether the stations currently contribute synoptic (S), climate (C) or upper-air (U) synoptic observations to the GTS, whether they are GCOS Surface Network (GSN), GCOS Upper-Air Network (GUAN) or GAW stations. Key stations are those that are GCOS stations or are over 200 km distant from a GCOS station. Station numbers beginning AA are sent on the GTS in SYNOP MOBIL code form. All operational AntON stations are expected to produce CLIMAT messages, provided that they have suitable data.

Note: In addition to AntON stations, a number of other stations in the Southern Ocean (within the responsibility of RAs I, III and IV) lie in the EC-PORS zone of interest and are, therefore, listed below AntON for information.

Abbreviations:  X = message or data expected; NO = not operational; 
Add = suggestion for addition to the RBCN; Closed = GAWSIS indicates station is closed or inactive.

Appendix 2

List of ships that operated in Antarctica during the 2015/16 season, with call signs and names.

The SCAR and WMO request that all ships operating in Antarctic waters should make meteorological observations and report them on the GTS.  

The following ships, which entered Antarctic waters in 2015/2016, made meteorological reports, they may have reported from outside Antarctic waters after the date given here.  For most ships the season begins in November or December and ends in March.  Country is the country of registration, VOS is the country of recruitment.  Monitoring is manual and may miss some ships.

    2. No Antarctic obs in January - 
    3. No Antarctic obs in February- 
    4. Obs received by UK Met Office, but frequently missing from Sailwx – Bremen, Dagmar Aaen, Europa, Plancius
    5. Reports via Yotreps - Alcyone
    6. Obs occasional – Bremen
    7. SHIP A sailed roughly from Australia to Casey, which might indicate that it was VNAA
    8. SHIP B was at 60°S 88.5°E and might be KAOU with an incorrect longitude









The following ships and yachts are known or suspected to have visited Antarctic waters in 2015/2016, but no synoptic reports were received whilst south of 60° (most records are via Palmer AIS).  Some have position only reports from Antarctica on the sailwx website :
