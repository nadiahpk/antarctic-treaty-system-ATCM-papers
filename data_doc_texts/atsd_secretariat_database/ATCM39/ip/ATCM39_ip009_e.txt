25th Anniversary of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: South African Accomplishments
Summary

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty commits Parties to the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and over the past 25 years has, through the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), defined environmental principles that must be considered in the planning and conduct of all activities in the Antarctic Treaty area.  South Africa, by ratifying the Protocol on 3 August 1995, confirmed its commitment to the environmental protection of the Antarctic environment.  In doing so it has attained a number of milestones. This Information Paper highlights some of South Africa’s main accomplishments in this regard.


South Africa’s main accomplishments

    • First country to undertake a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) under the Protocol, for the construction of a new station (SANAE IV) in Antarctica thereby, at the time, setting the benchmark to be followed by others;

    • Established a comprehensive Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) auditing system for the annual compliance monitoring of South Africa’s activities and operations in Antarctica.  This EHS audit has been undertaken annually for 23 years, ever since the commencement of the construction of SANAE IV in 1993/94, where findings are indicated as “compliance”, “partial compliance” and “non-compliance”, following which recommendations are made to address partial and non-compliance findings.  The system comprises a suite of documents, including inter alia:

    • Environmental Code of Conduct;

    • Vehicle, Depot and Cargo Handling Operations;

    • Adventure Policy

    • Safety (Fire and Evacuation) Procedures;

    • Waste Management Handbook; and

    • Fuel Spill Contingency Plan, and so on; 

    • Installed a water purification system to convert waste water generated in Antarctica to acceptable disposal levels, as approved by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS);

    • Introduced an integrated Waste Management Plan at our Antarctic Station.  A current upgrade is considering “greener” options – possibly a new vacuum system, to minimise the disposal of treated grey water (to SABS standards) into the environment;
   
    • Compiled a comprehensive Fuel Spill Contingency Plan, in line with the 2008 COMNAP Fuel Manual;

    • Completed a comprehensive decommissioning of the old SANAE III Emergency Base which was removed from the Antarctic ice shelf;

    • Constructed a new Emergency Base by re-using material from the decommissioned Neumayer II station;

    • Implemented comprehensive quarantine control measures at our Cape Town stores and other SANAP facilities, as well as on board the research and supply vessel to prevent the introduction on non-native species to Antarctica, including:

        ◦ Regular (but especially pre-voyage) quarantine inspections of various SANAP facilities (cargo, food, clothing and other stores), with a report containing the findings and recommendations to be addressed,

        ◦ Provision of a Gear Checks document to all voyage participants and conducting a Gear Checks (Boot washing) ceremony en route to all SANAP stations,

        ◦ Ensuring that all participants sign a Conservation Certificate indicating that they are familiar with the contents of the Protocol on Environmental Protection and its Annexes, as well as relevant SANAP policies and procedures,

        ◦ Strategically designed environmental presentation to all overwintering expedition members and relief personnel, and

        ◦ Rolling out an Environmental Awareness Strategy to relevant SANAP stakeholders.

    • Undertook our first inspection in 2013, jointly with Germany, of four other Antarctic stations, namely, Halley VI (United Kingdom), Princess Elisabeth (Belgium), Troll (Norway) and Maitri (India);  and

    • Investigating new technology and alternative energy for incorporation in our Antarctic operations. 

Current status

Now, 25 years later, South Africa is embarking on:
    • An extensive 4-phase upgrade of the SANAE IV station from the 2015/16 to the 2018/19 summer seasons, wherein environmental improvements, wherever possible, are being duly considered;

    • Revising its current national legislation, to include Annex VI of the Protocol, and to promulgate appropriate Regulations to give effect thereto;  and  

    • Possibly, in the near future, conducting its second inspection under Article 14 of the Protocol (carried out concurrently with inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty).
