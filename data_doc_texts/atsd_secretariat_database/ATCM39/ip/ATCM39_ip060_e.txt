Next step in eradication of a non-native grass Poa annua L. from ASPA No 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands

Information Paper submitted by Poland
Background
At ATCM XXXVIII - CEP XVIII (Sofia, 2015) Poland submitted IP78 “Eradication of a non-native grass Poa annua L. from ASPA No 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands”, reporting actions taken in 2014/2015 Antarctic season against non-native grass Poa annua observed at the Arctowski Station since 1985/1986, and in ASPA No 128 (on the deglaciated moraines of Ecology Glacier, ca 1.5 km from the Station) since 2008/2009.
In 2014/2015 season ice-free parts of ASPA No 128 were surveyed, and all found P. annua were removed (in total 57 individuals from two locations) in accordance with the Management Plan of ASPA No 128. Additionally, all P. annua from the moss-covered zone between ASPA No 128 boundary and Arctowski Station were mapped and removed.
Field work done in 2015/2016
In 2015/2015 research program “The causes, course and consequences of the expansion of Poa annua L. in Western Antarctica, a multi-aspect population study” (Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Warsaw University and Jagiellonian University, head of project - dr Katarzyna Chwedorzewska) was continued., and several actions relating to the presence of P. annua  inside ASPA No 128 were taken:
    • The survey of ice-free areas of ASPA No 128 was repeated. Only three seedlings of P. annua were found on the moraines of the Ecology Glacier in the same location as in 2014/2015. Detailed maps and photographic documentation were prepared.
    • All found seedlings were  removed by hand tools. Soil samples for the future analysis of soil seed bank were collected from under each tussock.
    • Morphometric analysis, as well as examination of the reproductive status of each individual plant were done. All collected material was taken to Poland for further research (genetics, morphology etc.). 
    • Sites from which P. annua was eradicated were marked for future long-term monitoring.
Additionally, similar actions were executed outside ASPA No 128, in the so-called Point Thomas Oasis, where Arctowski Station is located:
    • Detailed maps of the Point Thomas Oasis were prepared, with the area divided into 1 m2 research units. 
    • All units were surveyed for the presence of P. annua. Photographic documentation was prepared, and the location of each grass site was marked on the map.
    • All found P. annua were removed with hand tools. Due to the long-lasting snow cover the action was only partially completed, and 40 research units (ca 10%) were left for the next season.
    • Population structure, as well as reproductive status of non-native grass in each research unit were assessed.
    • Sites from which P. annua was eradicated were marked for future long-term monitoring.
