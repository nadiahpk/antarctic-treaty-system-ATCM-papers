IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2015-16 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 
2016-17 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
As in previous years, IAATO is pleased to provide estimates of Antarctic tourism from IAATO operators for the 2016-17 season and the statistical data from the Post Visit Reports for the recently concluded 2015-16 season.
These estimates are based on information provided to IAATO by its operators as of April 20, 2016. These numbers reflect only those travelling with IAATO member companies and do not include those individuals taking part in research projects that are being supported by IAATO operators. 
Preliminary numbers indicate that the general picture for 2015-16 season (38,478 persons) was similar to that forecast in ATCM XXXVII IP53 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2013-14, 2014-15 and Preliminary Estimates for 2015-16 Season, and slightly higher than the final figures for the 2014-15 season (36,702 persons). Forecasts for 2016-17 indicate that the numbers will rise to approximately 43,885 individuals. 
1.0	Overview
While this section focuses on the 2015-16 season’s information, additional information on all completed seasons, including activities and landing site use, will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under Guidelines and Resources, Tourism Statistics. Additionally, selected site-specific information is also available in ATCM XXXIX IP105 Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2015-16 Season.
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
IAATO’s Membership continues to incorporate the majority of private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS passenger ship operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area are currently members of IAATO, with one exception - a Japanese flagged non-IAATO cruise only vessel, ASUKA II that cruised the Antarctic Peninsula in January 2016. All of IAATO operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.

Final analysis of Post Visit Reports for the 2015-16 season indicates that there was a slight increase in the overall tourism statistics from the 2014-15 season. Ship borne tourism remains dominant on the Peninsula and there were no IAATO operator over-flights to the Antarctic continent. 

1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourism activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, snorkeling, stand up paddle boarding, skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays), running events, helicopter operations, underwater ROVs and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  These activities were undertaken in line with IAATO policies and guidelines. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s.

The vast majority of tourism voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from November to March), departing from Ushuaia, Argentina or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Antarctic Treaty Area. 
1.3	Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more than 100 different nationalities were represented by tourists who visited the Antarctic during the 2015-16 season.

1.4	Commercial Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels and Yachts
Detailed information of the activities conducted during the 2015-16 season are listed in Appendix 2, and anticipated activities for the 2016-17 season can be found in Appendix 3. All IAATO member activities are permitted or authorized through the Environmental Impact Assessments and Advance Notifications submitted in advance of the season. All activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and nearly all activities have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for more than a decade. 
1.5	Commercial Deep Field Tourism 
Four IAATO operators conducted deep field tourism activities during the 2015-16 season: 
    • Adventure Network International / Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) – one of the founding members of IAATO in 1991 – conducted activities for the 30th consecutive season. 
    • The Antarctic Company (TAC) operated in Antarctica for the 11th consecutive season and 7th as an IAATO operator. 
    • White Desert (WDL), which operated in Antarctica for the 10th consecutive season and 5th as an IAATO operator. Flights and logistics for WDL are coordinated through TAC. 
    • Arctic Trucks, which joined IAATO at the end of the 2013-14 season has operated in the Antarctic as a contractor since the 1990’s and as an operator since 2014-15 season.
    • ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and WDL operated out of Cape Town, South Africa. Arctic Trucks supported operations working from both ALE and TAC camps.
The four companies employed experienced guides; over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in the field.
1.5.1	Visitor & Staff Numbers
Details of the visitor numbers can be found in the appendices below. Deep field operators usually maintain a higher client to staff ratio  than is typical for seaborne tourism– often in the region of 1 guide to 3 clients. The exception is with solo expeditions, for example during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are supported remotely and closely through communication protocols, air drops and agreed search and rescue plans etc. 
1.5.2	Aircraft Operations
ALE:
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, wastes, fuel, staff, guides and passengers between SCCI Punta Arenas, Chile, and SCGC Runway 18M Union Glacier. 
    • One Boeing 757-200 made two intercontinental flights, one a proof-of-concept flight, the other to ferry passengers between SCCI Punta Arenas, Chile and SCGC Runway 18M Union Glacier. 
    • Two ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and one ski-equipped Douglas DC3-PT67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the Antarctic season.
TAC: 
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, wastes, fuel, staff, guides and passengers between Cape Town, South Africa and Novo Airbase.
    • One ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and two ski-equipped Douglas DC3-PT67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the Antarctic season.
1.5.3 	Ground Transport
    • ALE operated a number of tractor traverses, primarily for more efficient transport of fuel and cargo, and to support scientific activities.
    • ALE, TAC, WDL and Arctic Trucks all used modified wheel vehicles. 
1.5.4	Camps (Primary)
    • ALE Union Glacier Camp opened November 23, 2015 and closed February 19, 2016.
    • TAC Camp opened November 4, 2015 and closed on February 28, 2016.
    • WDL Camp opened November 10, 2015 and closed on January 11, 2016.
1.5.5	Programs and Activities
Activities including the operation of standard programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions, and logistical support of other expeditions for the 2015-16 season, are outlined in the table below. Total numbers participating include clients from all four IAATO deep field operators. Note that some clients participated in multiple programs.

1.6	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members

For the 2015-16 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO members

2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2016-17 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2016-17 season.
IAATO operators continue to refine the detail of their activity reporting. Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats, shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, snorkelling, skiing, snowboarding, stand-up paddle boarding, camping (including short overnight stays), helicopter operations, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and underwater remote operated vehicles (ROVs).
For the 2016-17 season, those tourism categories where passengers land ashore – traditional small and medium-size expedition ships and yachts, all carrying 500 or fewer passengers – are expected to reach 34,647 passengers. The increase is due to two principle factors: an growth in air/cruise tourism which is projected to increase to 3,154 clients; and the introduction to the market of a new vessel Midnatsol and the return of the Hamburg each of which anticipate carrying approximately 300+ passengers and together conducting circa 15 voyages.
Cruise-only tourism, aboard 500-plus passenger vessels with no passengers landing ashore, is projecting a slight increase to 8,680 passengers. Air-land tourism, which is conducted by the four IAATO Members that provide deep field excursions and expeditions, is projected to reach 558 visitors.
No over-flights by IAATO operators are expected during the 2016-17 season.
IAATO members will continue to work together so that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that tourism activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
