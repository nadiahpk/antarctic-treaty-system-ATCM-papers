Formation of Belarusian Antarctic infrastructure – modern state and prospects
The Republic of Belarus joined the Contract of Antarctic in 2006, and in 2008 it ratified “the Protocol for Environment Protection to the Contract of Antarctic” with 5 Appendices. In 2015 at COMNAP AGM XXVII in Tromso (Norway) the National Antarctic program of the Republic of Belarus has been adopted as the 30th member of COMNAP.
In 2006 in the Republic of Belarus the National program for polar researches “Monitoring of Earth’s polar areas and ensuring activity of the Arctic and Antarctic expeditions for 2007-2010 and for the period till 2015” was approved. 
Formation of Belarusian Antarctic infrastructure in 2006-2015
Within the period 2006-2016 at the logistic assistance of the Russian Federation eight seasonal Belarusian Antarctic expeditions (BAE) were organized. The main place of BAE location in Antarctic in 2007-2015 was the field base of the Russian Antarctic expedition (RAE) “Evening Mountain” (Eastern Antarctic, Enderby Land, Tala Hills). Since 2007 to 2015 the Republic of Belarus has performed significant volumes of works for the technical support of BAE activity with electric generators, motor vehicles, satellite VHF communication, solar-driven plants, automatic stationary devices for remote monitoring of atmosphere, such like automatic meteorological station, total ozone content meter, spectrum radiometer, ground-level ozone concentration meter, solar photometer CIMEL CE 318-N acting within the frames of the global radiometric network  AERONET, automated system of actinometric observations. Using own resources of Belarusian specialists the complex of repair and restoration works for creating acceptable conditions for arrangement and conductance of seasonal scientific researches of the expedition personnel in number till 7 persons was conducted in one of the constructions of the RAE “Evening Mountain” mounted during the times of the Soviet Union (see Figure 1, foreground).

In May 2015 at ATCM XXXVIII – CEP XVIII in Sofia (Bulgaria) the Republic of Belarus presented the information document under No. IP39 “Construction and functioning of Belarusian Antarctic station in Evening Mountain, Enderby Land – Final Comprehensive Evaluation of Environment”.  The presented document was approved by Consulting Parties of the Contract of Arctic without remarks what meant the acceptance of the final positive decision of realization by the Republic of Belarus of the proposed activity  (creation and functioning of the research station in Antarctic). 
The conceptual project of Belarusian Antarctic station (BAS) provides the creation within the period 2016-2025 in Eastern Antarctic in Enderby Land near the Evening Mountain, in proximity to the field base of RAE “Evening Mountain” (150 – 200 m), of the year-round research station which includes the complex of all necessary production and technological, service and residential and special-purpose constructions of modular (container) type. To the majority of objects of Belarusian Antarctic infrastructure the demands of universality, compactness, energy efficiency, technological and ecological safety are made which will allow to decrease significantly the consequences of the conducted activity on the Antarctic environment. Such approach does not require the conductance of extensive preparatory actions and use of special construction machinery when carrying out erection works and gives the opportunity of the operative disassembly of elements of BAS infrastructure in case of taking the decision of their use in other regions of Antarctic.  The placement of objects of BAS infrastructure is carried out at rest platforms adjusted by height which are mounted at sections of open emersion of rocks little drifted with snow. At the development of the BAS project not only unfavourable climatic peculiarities of Antarctic were taken into account, but also the necessity of conformity of the planned activity with the Protocol requirements for environment protection to the Contract of Antarctic.          
In December 2015 from the Republic of Belarus to the BAE field camp near Evening Mountain, Enderby Land in Eastern Antarctic  at the transport and logistic assistance of the Russian Federation the first BAS object – module of control, communication and navigation was delivered and assembled (67°39,5’S, 46°09,2’E)  (see Figures 2 and 3).

Plans for formation of Belarusian Antarctic infrastructure in 2016 – 2020
Since January 2016 the realization of the regular five-year stage of the National program for polar researches “Monitoring of Earth’s polar areas, creation of Belarusian Antarctic station and ensuring of the activity of polar expeditions during 2016-2020 and for period till 2025” began in the Republic of Belarus. Priority lines of activity of the Republic of Belarus in Antarctic in 2016-2025 will be works for creation of infrastructure of Belarusian scientific station in Antarctic for ensuring of the all-year-round activity of the BAE personnel in number till 12 persons, integration of national researches into international scientific programs of study of Antarctic and atmosphere monitoring networks, participation in the work of key public organizations of the system of the Contract of Antarctic, development of the international scientific and logistic cooperation as the most important factor of strengthening of the system of the Contract of Antarctic. 
Within 2016-2020 it is planned to include stage-by-stage into composition of the BAS first turn up to 12 infrastructure units of modular type, such like: service and residential, laboratory and residential sections, sanitary and hygienic block, medical box, modular oil-delivery terminal, new complex of diesel electric station,  incinerator (garbage furnace), garage-conservation boxes for oversnow equipment and offroad transport, storage heated and unheated pavilions, geophysical (nonmagnetic) pavilion and some other infrastructure units of residential, scientific, production and special purpose. The mentioned variant of organization of Belarusian research Antarctic infrastructure will allow already by 2019-2020 to create necessary conditions for the scientific and production activity and all-year-round placement of BAE personnel in number till 11-12 persons.



Prospects of formation of Belarusian Antarctic infrastructure in 2021 – 2025
Within the period 2021-2025 it is planned to include stage-by-stage into the composition of the BAS second turn up to 10 infrastructure units  of modular type of residential, production, nature protection and special purpose, what will finish the creation of BAE main infrastructure. In addition, actions for creation of the BAS second turn in 2021-2025 will provide the delivery, mounting and putting into operation of the equipment for processing and utilization of expedition activity wastes, conductance of nature protection actions including joint works with the Russian Federation for disassembly and moving out outside Antarctic of garbage units of the infrastructure and different types of wastes of the Soviet period of time from filed bases Evening Mountain and Youth, as well as the realization of the complex of actions for decrease of foreign matter emissions, waste water disposals, formation and utilization of wastes, prevention of fuel leakage, planning of research routes.
Within the period of BAS infrastructure organization in 2016-2025 and next years the realization of programs of environment state monitoring is planned in the area of BAE activity which are oriented to the evaluation of the accuracy of forecasts of influence of the economic activity on the environment and on revelation of unexpected consequences.
Logistic 
The logistic scheme of BAE activity in Antarctic is based on the close interaction with the Russian Federation, as well as the prospect development of the international logistic cooperation with other member countries of the Contract of Antarctic. In 2013 “Agreement of Cooperation in Antarctic” was signed between the Government of the Republic of Belarus and the Government of the Russian Federation. As a rule, the expedition personnel and BAE freight are delivered to Antarctic on board of ships of RAE “Academician Fedorov”(see Figure 4).

For delivery of the Belarusian personnel and freights from ship boards to the place of location in Antarctic helicopters K-32 are used. In addition, in 2016 for evacuation of the Belarusian personnel from the field camp near the Evening Mountain, Tala Hills, Enderby Land in Eastern Antarctic to the Russian station Novolazarevskaya, in cooperation with the International Antarctic Logistic Center in Cape Town (ALCI), the variant of aviation delivery by the airplane BT 67 was used.
