Managing Antarctic Heritage: British Historic Bases in the Antarctic Peninsula 









Managing Antarctic Heritage: British Historic Bases in the Antarctic Peninsula 
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Summary

It has been twenty years since a small field party from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) were deployed to Port Lockroy to rescue the historic structures of HSM 61.  This marked the start of the restoration of this important historic site and its establishment as a living museum on the Peninsula. The responsibility for the ongoing care and maintenance of Port Lockroy has since passed to the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT), a not-for-profit organisation based in the UK set up to conserve British Antarctic heritage and to promote public interest in Antarctic history. Five further sites; Wordie House, Damoy Point, Detaille, Stonington and Horseshoe have since been added to the portfolio. This twenty-year anniversary is perhaps a good moment to evaluate this programme of heritage management on the Antarctica Peninsula, as well as identify any areas of learning or improvement which might benefit other parties who manage HSMs.

Background

As part of the UK’s preparations to formally ratify the Environmental Protocol, a survey of all the abandoned British bases on the Antarctic Peninsula was undertaken in 1994.  The survey’s objective was to identify which of the former bases were of historical and cultural significance, and which needed to be removed. Ultimately, seven former bases were formally designated as Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs) and the remaining bases were either removed or ownership transferred to other Antarctic Treaty Parties.

Architectural and historical experts advised on the ongoing care and maintenance of the HSM-designated bases, including on the level of conservation intervention which might be appropriate, and suggestions as to the level of access which might be expected, and therefore managed, by visitors to the Antarctic Peninsula.  Each site was evaluated on its own merits and environmental circumstance and basic plans produced to guide future maintenance.

Since 1996, field parties, initially from BAS and later UKAHT, have visited these HSMs each Austral summer to undertake work to restore, repair and conserve the huts, structures and artefacts. Each site has been made structurally sound and weather-tight; unobtrusive interpretation has been installed to enable visitors to understand what they are looking at; and the sites are now safer places to visit. Port Lockroy has become a living museum, and staff work on-site during the summer months to undertake vital conservation work, as well as welcoming visitors.
 
The profile of Antarctic heritage in the care of the United Kingdom has also increased over the last 20 years.  Visitors to the Peninsula have increased, press and media interest has grown immeasurably, and, with the rise of the internet over this period, demand for information and online interest is growing exponentially.  This has provided great opportunities to encourage engagement and learning, and also to increase the awareness and value of this fragile heritage.

Discussion

Heritage management in Antarctica is a challenge:  The climate is unforgiving to the materials from which the historic buildings, structures and artefacts are made; the distances required to transport people and materials are vast; and therefore the cost of maintenance and restoration work is considerable.  However, with considerable support and assistance from others, including the British Antarctic Survey, Royal Navy and members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), the UKAHT has been able to undertake work vital to securing the future of the British historic bases; underpinning the UK’s commitment to manage heritage – whether in the UK or in Antarctica - to the highest international standards and for the benefit of all.

Most of the work undertaken to date, with the exception of Port Lockroy, has been designed to maintain the historic bases ‘as found’. This has focused on stabilising the fabric of the structures, making minor changes to improve weather tightness and ventilation, and basic work on artefacts to slow down deterioration.  A management plan for each site, setting out future restoration work, has now been developed, or is in progress.  The UK has also been keen to ensure that this in-situ heritage work goes hand in hand with education and outreach activity to engage a wider audience in Antarctica and its history. The UK does this through a Friends programme, public events and activities and, increasingly, online resources and activities.

The UKAHT, has also been working very closely with the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, who conserve and manage the heroic era huts in the Ross Sea, including those established by Captain Scott and Ernest Shackleton, as set out in ATCM XXXVIII/WP23 and presented to the CEP in 2015.  This is an excellent example of how closer collaboration between heritage programmes can underpin effective Antarctic heritage management.

Challenges 

There are a number of challenges when caring for the HSMs which we consider to be worth sharing:

    • Cost: the logistics of a conservation programme in Antarctica are complex and expensive and the expertise needed (conservation architects, artefact conservators, specialist trades), if it is to be done properly, comes at a price (even with the generous logistical support provided by others);

    • Time: the ongoing maintenance of heritage sites in Antarctica will never end. The destructive force of the Antarctic climate means that maintenance work can be swiftly undone and so management of Antarctic heritage is a continuous responsibility and therefore needs careful planning and financing;

    • Hazards: On the Antarctic Peninsula, much of the built heritage was established mid-20th century when materials used included; lead-based paints, asbestos and other materials now considered highly dangerous. These can present real danger to people on site and need to be handled under expert supervision and removed if at all possible, at a cost;

    • Accessibility: The best way to engage people is to allow them to visit the heritage sites, but very few people will get such an opportunity.  It is vital to engage a wider audience in other ways;

    • Visitor behaviour:  Most of the British historic sites are unmanned during the visitor season.  It is crucial that visitors behave responsibly, and that they respect these places as unique and vulnerable historic sites. There has unfortunately been both damage and loss over the years;

    • Peer support and evaluation: how do we know we are doing the right thing? It is beneficial for all the major heritage programmes to share their expertise, to consult with international expert bodies and to measure their practices against others. Getting the quality of the work right and making good heritage decisions will safeguard the heritage more effectively. 

Lessons learned

UKAHT has also learned a number of lessons over the last two decades of looking after the British historic bases:

    • A good conservation management plan, developed in conjunction with heritage expert advisers and working to established heritage values and standards, is essential;
    • It is critical to set a realistic budget; bearing in mind that it is always likely to cost more than expected;
    • Ongoing monitoring of the heritage sites is just as important as the maintenance work:  data loggers help with monitoring the environmental conditions to analyse the stresses on the heritage;
    • Plan for the long term – it is a task without end; and
    • People are interested, so share what you are doing and why – both on site and by other means.

The Future

The UK is currently reviewing its Antarctic heritage strategy and planning carefully for the future management of all British managed HSMs. The future will see greater rigour in planning; continued engagement of heritage expertise; greater collaboration with partner heritage organisations and much greater public engagement in the important stories the heritage represents. 

Recommendations

The United Kingdom recommends that CEP Members consider:

    • Encouraging greater collaboration among those responsible for the management of Antarctic heritage and HSMs, including to share and review plans and to collectively ensure Antarctic heritage is cared for to the highest standards;

    • Encouraging Parties to undertake assessments of the heritage value of HSMs and to develop management plans, particularly for new HSM designations, including consideration of long term management and maintenance, as well as any plans for wider public engagement on the importance of the site; and

    • How the CEP might communicate and share the significance of our shared Antarctic heritage more widely.
