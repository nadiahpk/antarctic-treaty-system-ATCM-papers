Revised Procedure for Selection and Appointment of the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty
Working Paper submitted by Argentina, Chile and the United States
Summary
The extended term of the current Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty is due to expire on 31 August 2017.  This paper proposes selection and appointment procedures for adoption at ACTM XXXIX to permit the ATCM to appoint a new Executive Secretary at ATCM XL.
Background
Article 3(1) of Measure 1 (2003) indicated that the Executive Secretary:
“…shall be appointed by the ATCM from among candidates who are nationals of Consultative Parties.  The procedure for the selection of the Executive Secretary shall be determined by a Decision of the ATCM.”
Decision 4 (2008) outlined a detailed procedure for the selection and appointment of the second Executive Secretary taking into account the then pending entry into force of Measure 1 (2003).
At ATCM XXXII, the Meeting appointed Dr Manfred Reinke as Executive Secretary for a four‑year term pursuant to Decision 5 (2009), with effect from 1 September 2009. Pursuant to Decision 2 (2013), this appointment was extended at ATCM XXXVI for an additional four‑year term with effect from 1 September 2013. Accordingly, Dr Reinke’s appointment expires on 31 August 2017.
Regulation 6.1 of the Staff Regulations for the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, as outlined in Decision 3 (2003), states that:
“6.1 In accordance with Article 3 of Measure 1 (2003), the ATCM shall appoint an Executive Secretary and shall establish the remuneration and such other entitlements as it deems appropriate. The Executive Secretary’s term of office shall be for four years unless otherwise decided by the ATCM and the Executive Secretary shall be eligible for reappointment for one additional term. The total length of employment may not exceed eight years.”
The Rules of Procedure, as outlined in Decision 3 (2005), are silent on the procedure for appointment of the Executive Secretary.
Proposed Decision
Annex A is a proposed Decision on a revised procedure for the selection and appointment of the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty taking into account that Measure 1 (2003) entered into force on 6 October 2009.
Suggested wording of an advertisement for use by Consultative Parties for the forthcoming appointment is attached as Annex B.
