Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2015-16

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina and Chile in conjunction with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Summary

Since 2010, the United Kingdom and IAATO have provided reports to the ATCM about the number of yachts sighted in the Antarctic during each previous season (ATCMXXXIII/WP52; ATCMXXXIV/WP20; ATCMXXXV/IP42; ATCM XXXVI/IP54; ATCM XXXVII/IP55; ATCM XXXVIII/IP96). Additionally, Argentina has in past years provided reports informing of yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia (ATCMXXXIV/IP21rev.1; ATCMXXXVII/IP88; ATCMXXXVIII/IP127rev.1). 

This paper consolidates information from the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile and IAATO relating to yachts sighted in Antarctica, or indicating an intention to travel to Antarctica, during the 2015-16 season.  The paper also recommends that Parties invite all those vessels that they authorise to visit Antarctica to report to them, as soon as possible, any yachts sighted in Antarctica which are not listed in the EIES Summarised Report of authorised vessels. 


Background

The ATCM has previously welcomed information about sighted yacht activities, which has enabled Parties to consider the overall volume of yachts known to be visiting the continent, and to confirm whether appropriate authorisations for such activities had been obtained. 

As in previous years, this paper includes information collected as part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and vessels) at the British-operated base Port Lockroy; and incidental sightings recorded by IAATO members. This year, the paper also includes information kindly provided by Chile, based on details recorded from yachts indicating an intention to travel from Puerto Williams to Antarctica and provided by Argentina in relation to yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia, as well as yachts visiting the Argentine base Brown. It would be helpful if Parties could provide any supplementary material which adds to or verifies this information. 

41 yachts were sighted in, or reported an intention to sail to, Antarctica during the 2015-16 season.  This represented a slight increase from 38 reported in 2014-15.  Just less than half were IAATO members (table 1); 16 were non-IAATO members, but had Party authorisation to travel to Antarctica (table 2); 1 vessel was sighted in Antarctica having been denied authorisation, 2 were understood to have not had Antarctic authorisation, and the authorisation status of a further 4 yachts remains unclear (table 3).

During this past year, the Secretariat developed an EIES summarised reporting tool, which can generate a complete list of all vessels included in pre-season information as having obtained authorisation to operate in Antarctica (http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ie_reports.aspx?lang=e).  This facility makes it much easier to determine whether a yacht is authorised, and consequently, this may be a useful tool for use in-season to expedite the verification of the authorisation status of any sighted yachts.


Recommendation

Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile and IAATO believe that it is important that the ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting activities in Antarctica, taking particular note to identify those yachts that may have been in the region without authorisation from a Treaty Party.  The proponents also recommend that the ATCM:
    1. Continues to encourage Parties to share information about yachts they have authorised, notably through the EIES Pre-Season Information facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with Resolution 5 (2005); and
    2. Encourages Parties to invite all those vessels that they authorise to visit Antarctica to report, as soon as possible, to them any yachts sighted in Antarctica which are not listed in the EIES Summarised Report of authorised vessels, to expedite the ability of Parties to verify authorisation status.
