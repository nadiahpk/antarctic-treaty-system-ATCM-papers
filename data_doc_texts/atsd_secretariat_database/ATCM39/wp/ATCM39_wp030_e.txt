Consideration of protection approaches for historic heritage in Antarctica

Submitted by Norway




1. Summary
The Environmental Protocol is comprehensive and encompasses both protection of the natural environment as well as historic values. In this working paper Norway discusses in-situ and ex-situ preservation approaches for historic heritage values. Aiming to reach an appropriate balance between the motivation and intentions held in Annex V and in Annex III, Norway suggests that the CEP considers developing guidance for the assessment of appropriate preservation methods for heritage elements considered for HSM listing in Antarctica.


2. Background and motivation
At CEP XVII, following up on a discussion at CEP XVI, Norway suggested initiating further discussion on HSM designations. Norway recalled earlier discussions where it had noted that many historic sites, structures and artifacts in Antarctica carry historical value, which over time may lead to the designation of a large number of HSMs (in accordance with Article 8 (2) of Annex V), which has the potential to contradict the Environment Protocol’s provision regarding clean-up of past activities in Antarctica (cf. Article 1 (5) in Annex III). Norway noted that current world wide heritage management practice also includes the possibility of other preservation methods in addition to physically maintaining such values in their original place. Norway suggested that it could be productive to hold a broader discussion about heritage management in the Antarctic context.

The designation of historic sites and monuments (Annex V to the Protocol) is intended to secure international representation of the types of historic heritage that have importance in the history of Antarctica. Guidance and criteria for such listings are provided in the Guidelines for the designation and protection of Historic Sites and Monuments appended to Resolution 3 (2009).

The HSM list has grown to encompass 92 protected sites and monuments, although some of these have been delisted or incorporated in other listed sites. Around 30 of the listed elements date from after the start of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957. Of the 11 listings made during the period 2011-2015, seven date from 1973 or later and one from 1959, while only three are pre-1958.  


3. Current practices for historic heritage conservation
Designated heritage objects are normally categorized as either fixed (such as structures) or movable (such as artifacts).  

Movable objects may be protected in situ (original setting) or ex situ (for example in a museum).  In rare cases, fixed objects may be moved. The Abu Simbel temples in Egypt, for example, were moved to higher ground due to planned flooding behind the Aswan Dam1, and in the Arctic small historical cabins have been pulled further inland due to coastal erosion. 

There can be both advantages and disadvantages to protecting heritage objects in situ.  

Advantages include:
    • Relevance to their setting: The object can best/only be understood and appreciated in full in its original setting (eg. coldness, isolation, wilderness).
    • Local interest and enthusiasm for protection: Heritage belonging to or ‘adopted’ by a local population will normally be adequately cared for.
    • Short term saving of resources that would be needed to remove the object.

Disadvantages include:
    • Long-term maintenance expenditure and resource usage: Adequate maintenance is normally costly (logistics and conservation resources).
    • A smaller audience: The visitation potential for sites and objects in remote locations will never match more central locations.
    • Local interest (and therefore care) may be less than interest shown from outside: No or few local populations will make heritage maintenance dependent on continued high interest from temporary populations. 

Ex-situ conservation may be preferable for objects that are either at risk from natural degradation processes, are too costly or difficult to maintain over time, could be seen and appreciated by a far larger number of people, or which are located in a natural environment where nature protection is of a higher priority.  In cases where highly prioritized heritage objects are in danger from human visitation copies may be made while the original is off-limits (for example the prehistoric wall paintings  at the World Heritage Lascaux Cave in France2).  A foreign ex situ setting may be partly alleviated by using various effects to give an impression of the original setting.

In some cases, it may be decided to either let the heritage site gradually fall into disrepair and disappear, or to remove it completely in order to restore the natural site. In both cases a thorough documentation of the site is required for it to be available in archive form. Recording the physical characteristics of historic places and landscapes is a cornerstone of preventive maintenance, monitoring and conservation. Rigorous documentation provides a means by which scholars and the public apprehend a site that has since changed radically or disappeared3.

Filming, 3D scanning, photography, interviews and storage of archival records are all accepted recording methods. With modern technology it is possible to create virtual realities, used inter alia to avoid impacts or to provide “access” to remote and inaccessible sites. 


4. Conservation approaches used in Antarctica
There are several examples of large scale in-situ conservation work in Antarctica. New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust has conducted a decade-long programme of heritage conservation for the buildings and artefact collections on Ross Island4. Similarly, the Mawson’s Huts Foundation (Australia) has funded and organised conservation work at the unique historic buildings located at Cape Denison. The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust has conducted work on the five historic sites Damoy Refuge, Detaille, Horseshoe, Stonington, and Wordie. The UKAHT’s maintenance of the Port Lockroy historic hut as a visitor centre/living museum provides an example of conservation through active use. Research is also being undertaken on various historic huts in Antarctica to understand and help to mitigate the degradation of timber materials.

In-situ preservation of heritage objects in Antarctica has normally proven to be resource intensive.  The historic huts are continually exposed to natural forces. As the huts get older and materials degrade, combined with the additional impacts of climate change and greater visitation, preservation becomes steadily more challenging. The huts were often established to last for only a short period, and preservation efforts will likely require structural changes and extensive replacement of materials. Furthermore, mitigation of snow build-up and melt water may be required.  Objects left in Antarctica need near-constant monitoring and maintenance to avoid irreparable damage and degradation. 

However, for those few people who are able to visit the objects in-situ the experience provides a deeper understanding of the conditions that the Antarctic pioneers met. 


5. Ex-situ preservation of Antarctic heritage
Few, if any, larger structures have been removed from Antarctica for ex-situ preservation, although copies of huts have been made. Examples of replicas of historic buildings from Antarctica include for example the replica of the Mawson huts on the waterfront in Hobart5, Tasmania and the Snow Hill hut at the polar museum in Gränna, Sweden (erected for short-term presentation in 2012/13). 
A number of larger objects have been removed for preservation and display:  

    • A Ferguson tractor, used by Sir Edmund Hillary’s party at the newly-constructed Scott Base during the British Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1955-58 is displayed at Canterbury Museum, which also holds from that same expedition a Tucker Sno-Cat and one of the tractors which was the first motorised vehicle to reach the South Pole overland.

    • A British Antarctic Survey Otter aircraft has been removed from Deception Island for restoration.  It is being considered whether or not it eventually can safely be returned to Deception Island.

    • There are also examples of smaller items that have been removed for ex-situ preservation and HSM listed plaques that have been purposely or accidentally removed and replaced by replicas. 

Once the objects have been resituated away from Antarctica, preservation and maintenance are far less demanding and the objects normally become available to a far greater number of people, providing room for better interpretation, greater contextualisation and storytelling opportunities and further-reaching potential for engagement.

The virtual tours that have been produced for Scott’s and Shackleton’s Huts in the Ross Sea region are outstanding examples of documentation efforts that provide such ex-situ experiences for the public.


6. Potential criteria for assessing heritage objects in Antarctica
Based on the above discussion, and with the desire to reach an appropriate balance between the motivation and intention held in both Article 8 (2) of Annex V and Article 1 (5) of Annex III, Norway suggests that the CEP considers developing guidance for the consideration of the most appropriate conservation approaches for management of historic heritage elements. Such guidance could build around inter alia the following questions: 
    • Are there current HSMs that adequately cover this particular type of historic value?
    • Can the object be better maintained and presented ex-situ?
    • Can the object be recorded, archivally preserved or better presented by digital methods?
    • What are risks and challenges involved (resources and otherwise) in maintaining the object in-situ?


Proposal
    • CEP considers advantages and disadvantages of in-situ vs. ex-situ preservation of historic objects in Antarctica in light of Annex III and Annex V provisions.
    • CEP considers developing guidance material for Parties’ use in the process of assessing whether in-situ or ex-situ preservation is most appropriate for an historic element in question, noting the suggested core elements of such guidance material provided in this working paper
    • CEP, as appropriate, establishes an ICG with its Terms of Reference to develop such guidance material.
