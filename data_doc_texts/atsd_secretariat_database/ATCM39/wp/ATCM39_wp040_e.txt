Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 127 “Haswell Island” (Haswell Island and Adjacent Emperor Penguin Rookery on Fast Ice) 
Working Paper submitted by the Russian Federation
Summary
The Russian Federation, on the basis of the recently received data reviewed the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 127 “Haswell Island” (Haswell Island and Adjacent Emperor Penguin Rookery on Fast Ice) and concluded that only minor changes were required.  
The Russian Federation suggests that the CEP approve the attached Revised Management Plan for this Area.
Background
The Haswell Island is a unique place of nesting of almost all species of birds nesting in East Antarctica. Five species of Pinnipeds are encountered in the Area. East and southeast of the island there is a large rookery of the Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri on fast ice. The Russian Antarctic Mirny station is located near the Area.
Due to aforementioned reasons, it was proposed by the Soviet Union in 1975 at VIII ATCM (Oslo) and designated as SSSI No. 7. It was renamed and numbered as ASPA No. 127 on the basis of Measure 1 (2002). The revised ASPA management plans were adopted on the basis of Measure 3 (2001), Measure 4 (2005), Measure 1 (2006) and Measure 5 (2011). 
The Area was described by biologists of the first Soviet Antarctic Expeditions and it was studied in the 1970s and at the present time, presenting valuable material for a comparative analysis and monitoring of multiyear environmental impact of the Antarctic station.  
Revised Management Plan
In accordance with Article 6.3 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011) the Russian Federation conducted a five-year review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 127 “Haswell Island” (Haswell Island and Adjacent Emperor Penguin Rookery on Fast Ice).
The changes affected section 1. Description of protected values where historical information about discovery and name of Haswell island and updated evidence on the Area was added, and subsection 6(i)  Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features, which now includes data from observations and zoological research conducted in the last five years. The Area boundaries were not changed.  
Review of amendments to the Management Plan:
    • Section 1. Description of protected values. The following was added:
    • Historical information on discovery of the island;
    • Updating of distances, island area and location of the rookery of Emperor Penguins Aptenodytes forsteri;
    • Information on appearance on Haswell Island of nests of the Lonnberg skua Catharacta Аntarctica lonnbergi.   
    • Subsection 6(i). Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features includes new information obtained by monitoring in the Area: 
    • on registered and natural dispersal outside the nesting areal of the Lonnberg skua Catharacta Antarctica lonnbergi;
    • on establishing cases of nesting of hybrid pairs of Lonnberg skua Catharacta Antarctica lonnbergi and South-Polar skua Catharacta maccormicki; 
    • on comparative assessment of the emperor penguin population over the research period from 1956 to 2015;
    • Section 8. Bibliography includes data from two new sources.
    • Obsolete reference was removed from description in Map 3.  
    • The text and structure of the document were subjected to minor changes. 
Recommendation
The Russian Federation suggests that the CEP approve the attached Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 127 “Haswell Island” (Haswell Island and Adjacent Emperor Penguin Rookery on Fast Ice).
