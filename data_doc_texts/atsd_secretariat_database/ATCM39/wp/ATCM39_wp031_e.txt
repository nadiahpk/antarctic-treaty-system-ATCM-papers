Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on 2015/16 Intersessional Work
Working Paper submitted by Norway on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
During the 2015/16 intersessional period the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP), in accordance with its Terms of Reference #1 to #3, was prepared to review 5 draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) management plans referred by the Committee for intersessional review. 
The SGMP advises the CEP that no progress has been made, as the proponent, due to circumstances, was unable to progress the work. Thus, further intersessional work needs to be conducted with regards to the following five management plans submitted for intersessional review:
    • ASPA No. 125: Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 144: ‘Chile Bay’ (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 145: Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 146: South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 150: Ardley Island (Ardley Peninsula), Maxwell Bay, King George Island (Chile)
The SGMP work plan for the 2015/16 intersessional period also included the following task against ToR #4 and #5: Continue the work to develop guidance for preparing and reviewing ASMA management plan in according with agreed work plan for the process, i.e. initiate work on developing guidance on determining whether an area should be designated as an ASMA.
    1. Background
During the 2015/16 intersessional period the SGMP operated in accordance with the work plan agreed by CEP XVIII (Final Report, para. 158), and the Terms of Reference adopted by CEP XIII (Final Report, Appendix 1):
    1) Examine any draft new or revised Management Plan to consider, in consultation with relevant experts if appropriate:
    • whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol, particularly Articles 3, 4 and 5, and with relevant CEP guidelines;
    • its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness;
    • whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation; and
    • whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole.
    2) Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.
    3) Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management Plan, identifying where the Plan reflects comments received by Members, and where they have not been, the reasons for not doing so. The Working Paper is to include all revised Management Plans and the information required by the ATCM’s Legal and Institutional Working Group.
    4) Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review.
    5) Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent and likely to be effective.
The SGMP was convened by the CEP Vice-Chair, Birgit Njåstad from Norway. Representatives from Argentina, ASOC, Australia, Chile, Germany, IAATO, India, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, United Kingdom and United States were registered to participate within the SGMP framework, noting however that all plans are available for comment from any CEP member during the SGMP process. Discussions took place by correspondence, using the CEP Discussion Forum and email.
    2. Review of the revised draft management plans 
Reference is made to the summary provided in ATCM XXXVIII/WP 15. Five ASPAs were retained in the SGMP for further consideration by SGMP in the 2015-16 intersessional period. The proponent (Chile) has not been in the position to provide updated draft management plans for these five areas: ASPA 125 (Fildes Peninsula, King George Island), ASPA 144 (“Chile Bay” (Discovery Bay)), ASPA 145 (Port Foster, Deception Island), ASPA 146 (South Bay, Doumer Island) and ASPA 150 (Ardley Island (Ardley Peninsula), Maxwell Bay, King George Island).  In March 2016 it became clear to the SGMP that it would not be possible to finalize the draft management plan in due time for an appropriate review by the SGMP before CEP XIX. Further work on these plans were therefore to be postponed.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP advises the CEP that further intersessional work will be conducted with regard to the draft management plan for ASPA No. 125, ASPA No. 144, ASPA No. 145, ASPA No. 146 and ASPA No. 150.
    3. Terms of Reference #4 and #5 on improving management plans and the process for their intersessional review
During CEP XVII, with reference to earlier discussions in the CEP on the need for guidance material for establishing ASMAs and for preparing and reviewing ASMA management plans, the Committee noted the importance of the topic. Consequently, during the 2014-15 intersessional period, the SGMP developed a work plan for further work on this important topic, which was accepted and adopted by CEP XVIII. The SGMP work plan for the 2015/16 intersessional period therefore included the following task against ToR 4 and 5: Continue the work to develop guidance for preparing and reviewing ASMA management plan in according with agreed work plan for the process, i.e. initiate work on developing guidance on determining whether an area should be designated as an ASMA. The discussions relating to this item on the work plan was co-convened by SGMP member Polly Penhale (US) and SGMP convener Birgit Njåstad (Norway).

SGMP had the following aim for the intersessional period: Develop and submit to the CEP draft guidance material aiming to assist any Party, SCAR or CCAMLR in implementing a stepwise and comprehensive pre-assessment process for determining whether an area merits ASMA designation and if so, what elements need to be taken into consideration and discussed in context of proper management of the area. In short: develop a set of tools that will enable a systematic assessment, design and proposal of new ASMA in line with intent and purpose held in the provisions of Article 4, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol.
Three rounds of discussions were held in the SGMP, in which the following items were considered:

    • elements that should be covered by the guidance material, noting in this context relevance of similar/existing guidance material for ASPA designations as a useful input/starting point for this purpose;
    • commonalities between existing ASMA management plans and how they have approached the various elements relevant for the purpose to inform the development of general guidance on these topics; 
    • format of guidance material, e.g. whether a checklist or a more comprehensive guideline document will best fit the purpose; and
    • draft guidance material. 

Discussions were constructive and fruitful. All in all 11 Members and Observers were involved in the discussions (Argentina, ASOC, Australia, Germany, France, IAATO, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, United Kingdom and United States). A record of the full discussion, including all material developed during the process, is available on the online CEP Discussion Forum. In particular, it may be worth referring to the summary of the assessment of commonalities and differences between current ASMAs used as a starting point for development of guidance material. Some of the key findings were:

    • Documentation from the pre-designation phase (i.e. discussion and planning phase) is rarely available, and therefore it is both difficult to understand what process lies behind and what considerations have been made.
    • Documentation of environmental risk that could ensure if activities are not coordinated is lacking or only indirectly referenced in most of the management plans.
    • All of the management plans relied on zones and codes of conduct as management tools.
    • Most adopted management plans did not include information on consultation with stakeholders; however, inclusion of stakeholder views was apparent in documentation of pre-plan discussions.

As a result of the SGMP deliberations during the intersessional period, it was agreed that two sets of guides would be required, namely a draft guide to guide the assessment process and one to guide the preparation of a management plan once there is a conclusion that the ASMA tool is the most appropriate management tool to manage the area under discussion. The SGMP furthermore concluded that it would focus the current intersessional period on the first of these two items, preparing and providing a draft “assessment guide” for the further deliberation by the CEP.

On this basis the SGMP developed a draft guide for assessing whether an ASMA is the most appropriate management tool for an area in question. The SGMP present this draft to the CEP for discussion, not for adoption.  The aim is at this stage to gather input from the discussion within the CEP to form the basis of a new round of discussion/text development during the 2016/17 SGMP intersessional period. The aim would be to have this document adopted by the CEP in 2017. This pathway ensures and enables a broad discussion with the membership of the CEP.

It should be noted that issues have been raised within the SGMP that have yet to be fully discussed due to time limitations. These issues will be explored further in the next round of discussions.


Advice to the CEP
The SGMP advises the CEP that the Work plan for 2016/17 should include the following two elements:
    • Finalization of the development of guidance on determining whether an area should be designated as an ASMA. 
    • Initiation (and finalizing if possible) of the development of guidance on the process of preparing a management plan once there is a conclusion that the ASMA tool is the most appropriate tool to manage the area under discussion.
