The COMNAP Unmanned Aerial Systems-Working Group (UAS-WG) 








The COMNAP Unmanned Aerial Systems-Working Group
(UAS-WG) 
Summary
The challenge for any national Antarctic program that is beginning to utilize Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technologies in the Antarctic Treaty region is to identify and manage risks associated with the technology, and to develop guidelines that will regulate UAS use in differing circumstances, in order to reduce or mitigate those risks. COMNAP established a UAS Working Group (UAS-WG) with a view to elaborate a handbook which can be used by national Antarctic programs to develop a process for UAS deployment in the Antarctic Treaty area. The handbook includes UAS-WS recommendations to assist with the activity in the Antarctic Treaty area, recognising that as countries develop their own UAS regulation, national Antarctic programs must act in a manner that does not contradict their national rules and regulations. The COMNAP UAS Handbook should be viewed as a living document which, as UAS technology evolves, and as published research on the use of and impacts, including environmental impacts, from UAS in Antarctica is made available and further developed in conjunction with SCAR and others, the recommendations and appendices are expected to evolve.  
Background
At ATCM XXXVII/CEP XXVII (2013) there was discussion on deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) 1 in the Antarctic. As a result, COMNAP, SCAR and IAATO were asked to consider the issue and bring back information which explored utility and risks of UAV operation in Antarctica. COMNAP presented ATCM XXXVIII WP022 UAV Use in Antarctica–Risks and Benefits other papers by SCAR, IAATO and the USA were also presented and discussed.  As a result of those discussions and those at the CEP XXVII, the Final Report of ATCM XXXVIII, paragraph 185 states: “The Meeting expressed general support for UAV use, and acknowledged UAVs as an important tool for the future. It also agreed that more research was needed. The Meeting welcomed COMNAP’s efforts in this area, and looked forward to considering COMNAP’s forthcoming guidelines on UAV use.” This Working Paper presents information on COMNAP’s efforts to date.
The COMNAP Unmanned Aerial Systems Working Group (UAS-WG)
COMNAP has always discussed issues in regards to air operations and safety.  After focussed discussion of UAS deployment as part of the Safety Session at COMNAP Annual General Meeting (AGM) XXVII, in August 2015, COMNAP agreed to establish the Unmanned Aerial Systems Working Group (UAS-WG) which would focus efforts on UAS-related issues. This Working Paper reports on the establishment of the UAS-WG, presents the groups terms of reference, presents a summary of initial discussions (September 2015 through March 2016) –in the form of the Antarctic UAS Operator’s Handbook (the “Handbook”) and makes a recommendation to the meeting for consideration.
UAS-WG Statement of Purpose
Through this COMNAP Working Group, reduce risk to people, infrastructure and environment in the Antarctic Treaty area, while enabling, in situations where allowed, UAS use in the area for scientific applications and science support purposes.

Internal COMNAP Relationships
The UAS-WG is a subgroup of the Air Expert Group and recognises that there is strong overlap of issues with the Safety, Environment, and Science Expert Groups, and, overlap to a lesser extent, with the Energy & Technology, Training, and Shipping Expert Groups.
UAS-WG Terms of Reference
    1. Develop, thereafter regularly update, the “COMNAP Guidelines for Certification and Operation of Unmanned Aerial Systems in Antarctica” (the “Handbook”) for UAS deployment in the Antarctic Treaty area by COMNAP Member national Antarctic programs;
    2. Support COMNAP Member national Antarctic programs to prepare their program’s UAS Operating Procedures which are specific to their own Antarctic operations;
    3. Act as a forum of experts that serve as a resource to provide information and advice to any COMNAP Member program, especially those without previous aviation operation experience, who wish to develop a UAS supported project or programme in the Antarctic Treaty area;
    4. Assist COMNAP Member national Antarctic programs to exchange information on UAS deployment and use in the Antarctic Treaty region;
    5. Explore emerging technologies which would be of benefit to national Antarctic program activity in the Antarctic Treaty area and which will assist with the evolution of the Handbook to maintain currency;
    6. In order to strengthen safety of air operations, communicate, in a collaborative manner with IAATO members, CCAMLR members and their vessels, non-COMNAP Member programs and non-consultative countries undertaking activity in the Antarctic Treaty area, COMNAP information on UAS use in the area. 
UAS-WG Composition
There was already in place within the COMNAP Air Expert Group, significant expertise related to air operations in Antarctica.  The UAS-WG was formed as a sub-group of the Air Expert Group. Also, recognising that there are already in place regional air operations arrangements across Antarctica, the UAS-WG should utilise this existing network and endeavour to be representative of each of those Antarctic regions and include wide expertise on air operations and on environmental and safety issues. Recognising that others within these regions may also operate aircraft and airfields, and that there is overlap of regional boundaries and cross-national Antarctic program activities, and that interest from various COMNAP national Antarctic programs was explicitly expressed at the AGM, additional representatives should also be included. 

The following are the inaugural UAS-WG members:
    • Robb Clifton (AAD) robb.clifton@aad.gov.au 
    • Uwe Nixdorf (AWI) uwe.Nixdorf@awi.de 
    • John Hall (BAS) jhal@bas.ac.uk 
    • Giuseppe de Rossi (ENEA) giuseppe.derossi@enea.it
    • Yves Frenot (IPEV) yves.frenot@ipev.fr 
    • Hyoung Chul Shin (KOPRI) hcshin@kopri.re.kr 
    • Kazuyuki Shiraishi (NIPR) kshiraishi@nipr.ac.jp 
    • Agnieszka Kruszewska (PAS) agnieszkak@ibb.waw.pl 
    • Cheng Yanfeng (PRIC) chengyanfeng@pric.org.cn 
    • Valery Lukin (AARI/RAE) lukin@aari.ru 
    • Brian Stone (NSF/USAP) bstone@nsf.gov

Members from three other national Antarctic programs were also invited but did not participate in this inaugural discussion due to Antarctic research season commitments.  All COMNAP representatives may contribute to discussions if they wish to do so through the Air Expert Group and discussions and documents prepared by this UAS-WG could be read and commented on by any COMNAP member with a username and password access to the members-only Air Expert Group discussion forum.
The Antarctic UAS Operator’s Handbook
The COMNAP Handbook (see attachment) presents a summary of the discussions led by the UAS-WG.  The Handbook is divided into three parts: 
     - Part 1 includes introductory/general  information. 
     - Part 2 contains recommendations of the UAS-WG. 
     - Part 3 contains appendices of various templates of common forms, such as communications plans and UAS pilot logs. These templates are provided for use by national Antarctic programs and can be modified to suit a specific UAS activity. They can then be incorporated into any national Antarctic program UAS guidelines or Operating Manuals which are specific to their operations and situations.

The COMNAP UAS Handbook should be viewed as a living document which, as UAS technology evolves, and as published research on the use of and impacts from UAS in Antarctica is made available, the recommendations and appendices are expected to evolve.  Comments from any COMNAP Member organisation, on any aspect of this Handbook, would be welcomed. 
Recommendation
COMNAP recommends that the ATCM supports the usefulness of the Handbook and encourages countries to give consideration to the non-mandatory guidance this Handbook provides if/when their national Antarctic program is planning to use UAS technologies in the Antarctic Treaty area.  COMNAP considers that the Handbook will evolve as technology evolves and as research related to environmental risks and benefits of UAS use is published. COMNAP therefore looks forward to continued discussions by the CEP on those issues and would participate in any such discussions, including participation in a UAS-focused ICG, if invited to do so.
