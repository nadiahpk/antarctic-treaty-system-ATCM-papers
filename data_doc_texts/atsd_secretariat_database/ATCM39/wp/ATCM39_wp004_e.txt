Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 126 - Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands










Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Chile and Spain
Summary
The United Kingdom, Chile and Spain have conducted a review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom, Chile and Spain recommend that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan and recognise Spain as a co-managing Party, with the United Kingdom and Chile, for ASPA No. 126.
Background
The United Kingdom, Chile and Spain have conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, in accordance with Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011). 
ASPA No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, (latitude 62°34'35" S, longitude 61°13'07" W) was originally designated as Specially Protected Area (SPA) No. 10 through Recommendation IV-10 in 1966. Designation as an SPA was terminated through Recommendation VIII-2 and re-designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) was made through Recommendation VIII-4 (1975, SSSI No. 6). Following a proposal by Chile and the United Kingdom, the SSSI was subsequently extended through Recommendation XVI-5 (1991) to include boundaries similar to those of the original SPA through Recommendation XV-6 (1989, SSSI No. 31).  The primary reason for the designation of Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) is to protect the terrestrial and lacustrine habitats within the Area.  
Summary of amendments
A revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 126 is provided at Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Management Plan. The amendments are summarised as follows:
    • A reference to the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to the Introduction.
    • Annex 1 Supporting Information has been updated, based upon new scientific information.
    • A General Permit Condition has been added stating that cumulative impacts of geological sampling are taken into consideration in any EIA.
    • The following text has been added under section 7(ii) Access to and movement within or over the Area: ‘Overflight of bird colonies within the Area by Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) at an altitude likely to result in harmful interference shall not be permitted unless in accordance with a permit issued by an appropriate national authority.’
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA Management Plans and with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
