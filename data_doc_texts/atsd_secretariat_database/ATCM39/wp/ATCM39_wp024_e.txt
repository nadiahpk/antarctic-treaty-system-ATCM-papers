First report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach

Working Paper submitted by Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and UK

Summary
The Meeting decided to establish an intersessional contact group (ICG) on Education and Outreach at ATCM XXXVIII, following a number of Terms of reference related to Education and Outreach. As requested by the Meeting, this paper aims to provide an initial report on the discussions taken within the ICG, and recommends considerations by the ATCM of the outcomes of the intersessional work.

Background
During ATCM 37 in  Brasilia, in WP09, Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, and UK, recognised a need for better public and educational outreach activities. Noting the increasing importance of Antarctic issues in global science and the work it recommends that the ATCM endorse the organization of a workshop to be held prior to ATCM XXXVIII (Paragraph 323, report ATCM XXXVII).  The ATCM accepted this suggestion and Bulgaria agreed to host this workshop. The workshop was held on the 31st of May in Sofia before the ATCM XXXVIII. The workshop was organised and led by Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, and the UK. The meeting was co-chaired by Bulgaria and Portugal.  Ninety seven participants from thirty seven parties observers and experts. Twenty six oral presentations, nineteen poster presentations and twenty two papers were delivered to the workshop (ATCM XXXVIII BP26).
 It was recommended at the workshop that an ATCM forum in the field of education and outreach be formed and that it should take the form of an ICG. Bulgaria highlighted that this forum would work together to maximise the impact of the 25th anniversary of the Madrid Protocol.
The Meeting decided to establish an ICG on education and outreach with the following Terms of Reference:
    • foster collaboration and support, at both the national and international level;
    • develop, encourage, and share results of educational and outreach initiatives that promote scientific observations and results, environmental protection initiatives and the work of Antarctic Treaty Parties in managing the Antarctic Treaty area, as an educational and outreach instrument to reinforce the importance of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection;
    • acknowledge the related education and outreach activities by expert groups and encourage cooperation with these groups;
    • coordinate educational and outreach activities related to the 25th Madrid Protocol anniversary celebrations; and
    • provide an initial report to Working Group 2 at ATCM XXXIX.
 
ATCM 38 updated the guiding principles for the implementation and development of the Multi-Year Strategic Plan for the ATCM. Following the discussion on Education and Outreach at the workshop and during the meeting, one of these updates was to contribute to nationally and internationally coordinated education and outreach activities from an Antarctic Treaty perspective.
 
Method of Operation
The ICG operated using the online ATCM Discussion Forum, under the topic ‘ICG on Education and Outreach’. The discussion was open to all Parties, Observers and Experts. Currently there are 38 points of contact listed as participating in the ICG. Of these, 16 parties, observers and experts (up to 14.03.2016) are actively participating in the forum.
The ICG began work with an opening announcement by the convener 3rd of July 2015. The work plan was arranged in three stages:
    • Stage 1: Opening announcement
    • Stage 2: Collecting points of contact and requesting parties to provide information about national education and outreach activities and planned activities for the 25th anniversary of the Madrid Protocol
    • Stage 3: Working Paper report of the ICG for ATCM XXXIX

Discussions
There are 39 posts (up to 07.04.2015) within the ICG of which 18 are posts of parties, observers and experts sharing some of their education and outreach activities. The forum also contains 5 other topics for discussion, Antarctica Day; COMNAP Education and Outreach Expert Group breakout session; The 30th anniversary of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and a Timeline  of the Madrid Protocol celebrations (open to all parties);Working Paper presented by Spain. 
The 16 Parties that have shared some of their activities so far are as follows: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Observers and Experts that have shared information are COMNAP, IAATO and WMO.
Looking through all posts in the ICG, countries have shared many different ways of conveying information and increasing interest in Antarctica as well as Environmental issues, National Antarctic Programs and the effects of climate change in relation to Antarctica. Considering language and cultural differences across parties, a few channels of communication seem to be common and most effective.
Films, documentaries and TV interviews are used by many parties to raise awareness about Antarctica and Antarctic issues. TV relations from Antarctic bases, interviews with participants in National Antarctic expeditions or documentaries filmed in Antarctica are often mentioned by parties as a method of reaching a broad audience and rising interest.
Work with children across ages is also common practice for many of the participants in the ICG. Talks and presentations in schools are often chosen for the older children and young adults. They focus on teaching about Antarctica, the environmental issues it faces and the work done by national programs and scientific work carried out. Interest in the younger children is raised through entertaining games and books, which focus on, for example, Antarctic animals. Books especially targeted at teaching children about Antarctica are also popular practice. Work with teachers is another very popular outreach method.
Websites and interactive games are also often created by countries to increase interest in Antarctica and Antarctic activities.  Interactive quizzes, videos, charts and presentations make information more accessible and interesting to both children and adults. In such websites information is available around the world 24/h a day. Some websites and activities are also available in more than one language 
Scientific blogs are also a practical tool to reach a large audience and communicate about the scientific motivation of the field expeditions and measurements in Antarctica, and their relevance for society.
Art and photography are another medium often used to teach and raise interest in Antarctica and Antarctic activities. Exhibitions of art and photography of artists who have travelled to Antarctica or working there are common among countries. Competitions for children and adults resulting in such exhibitions, both in the given countries and in Antarctica, are frequent practice.
Most parties participate in different types of national and international science fairs and events. Many parties participated in or held events related to POLAR WEEKS (organized by the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) and Polar Educators International (PEI) or Antarctica Day as well as participating in other national events dedicated to Science, the environment or Antarctica.
Another outreach method used by many parties is holding conferences and seminars on Antarctic topics, such as environment or the work of national Antarctic programs. Conferences and Seminars are often held by universities but not limited to them. Foreign Lecturers are invited as guests or participate in video conferences as well as holding video conferences from Antarctic National Bases.
A lot of work is carried out in order to increase outreach and improve education on Antarctic topics. However most of the work done focuses on Antarctica, the flora and fauna there, environmental issues and the work done by national programs. Very few of the projects carried out  inform and teach about the Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol itself. 
Recommendations
The ICG recommends that the ATCM
    • Recognizes the usefulness of the Forum on Education and Outreach;
    • Advises the Parties to promote using the Forum to provide information of their activities related to Education and Outreach;
    • Assess key international activities/events related to education and outreach that Parties can engage;
    • Promotes the usage of educational materials already available in the Forum (and assess the need for any translations);
    • Promotes the usage of the Forum to engage more Parties on Education and Outreach;
    • Looks into assessing other reliable sources of Educational materials, such as Antarctic Environment Portal.;
    • Advises the Parties to promote not only Antarctica and Antarctic research through their Education and Outreach Activities but the Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol itself.
