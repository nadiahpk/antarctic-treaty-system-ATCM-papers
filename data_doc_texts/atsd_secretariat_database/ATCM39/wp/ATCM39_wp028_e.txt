Report of the Intersessional Contact Group ‘Developing a Strategic Approach to Environmentally Managed Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities’
Summary
At its XXXVIII meeting the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) agreed to establish an Intersessional Contact Group on Working Towards Developing a Strategic Approach to Tourism (the ICG), convened by New Zealand and India, with the following mandate: 
Noting ATCM XXXVII/WP 24, IP 104 rev.1 and the General Principles on Antarctic Tourism (2009) and in the light of existing ATCM/CEP recommendations, to identify priority questions and gaps with respect to Antarctic tourism, on the basis of which a focused discussion on identifying a limited number of priority questions and gaps could take place at ATCM XXXIX. 
This report summarises the outcome of the discussions in the ICG. 
Background
The opening announcement, along with the proposed work plan and schedule, was placed on the ATCM forum on 3 November 2015. There were no suggestions for changes in the work plan.
On 24 November 2015, Stage Two of the ICG was launched on the ATCM forum. The Secretariat’s paper, ‘Review of ATCM Discussions Relating to Antarctic Tourism, 2008-2015’ was circulated with the suggestion that it be used as a tool to prompt discussion on the topic of ‘Working Towards Developing a Strategic Approach to Environmentally Managed Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities’. It was suggested to the participants that they also take into account:
    • The outcomes of the 2011/2012 Intersessional Contact Group ‘Outstanding Questions’ on Antarctic Tourism;
    • The Committee on Environmental Protection’s Tourism Study (2012) and actions under way to advance its recommendations;
    • Outcomes from the Special Working Group on Competent Authorities (2015); and 
    • Existing ATCM/CEP/ATME papers and recommendations, including those presented by India and New Zealand at ATCM XXXVIII.
Participants in the ICG were asked to comment on four questions:
    1. What would a strategic approach to environmentally managed tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica, and its various building-blocks, look like?
    2. What would we do differently as a result of adopting a strategic approach?
    3. What are the priority areas and gaps that we need to address in formulating this approach?
    4.  What could be the possible pathways to arrive at this approach?
It was requested that comments be submitted by 14 December 2015. Contributions were received from Germany, United Kingdom, ASOC, Norway, Argentina and France.
On 10 February 2016 a ‘Summary of Responses’ was posted on the ATCM forum.
A further and final call was placed on the ATCM forum on 8 March 2016, with the request that comments be submitted by 16 March 2016. Contributions were received from Australia, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, the United States and Argentina.
As most participants noted, many of the priorities, gaps and suggestions put forward are not new and have been consistently identified throughout previous ICGs and Working Papers addressing tourism. This paper describes the general themes from the ICG and makes recommendations for future programme of work to be discussed at ATCM XXXIX. 
Summary of discussions
As an overview, general themes covered by the responses were as follows:
Benefits from well-managed tourism:
    • Educational enrichment and outreach tool;
    • Awareness-raising of the need for environmental preservation and protection;
    • Expansion of public engagement;
    • Peaceful activity in Antarctica, often bringing together a wide range of international operators and individuals; and
    • The potential to provide support for scientific, monitoring and environmental management activities.
Risks associated with poorly managed tourism:
    • Environmental impacts;
    • Degradation of the pristine nature of habitats, thereby devaluing their scientific integrity;
    • Financial and scientific costs, and physical risks, to National Antarctic Programmes due to diversion of resources to respond to search and rescue events;
    • Specific risks associated with terrestrial tourism, particularly with adventure tourism, including those related to safety, search and rescue; and 
    • Potential interference of tourists with scientific experiments.
Participants also noted a number of factors increasing the urgency of this work:
    • Increased diversity of tourism activities, including a continual upward trend in “adventure” tourism;
    • Increasingly high-risk activities being undertaken;
    • Expansion of tourism into a wider geographical area;
    • Concern by many participants that tourism was evolving faster than ATCM could regulate (while some participants felt that this was not the case) ;
    • Tourist activities taking place outside of IAATO industry self-regulation;
    • Development of private tourist facilities, including airstrips and commercial flights;
    • A lack of up-to-date commonly-held information about the scale and nature of activities.
Participants responded to the four questions mentioned above as below:
1	What would a strategic approach to environmentally managed tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica and its various building blocks look like?
Generally, participants agreed that the focus of a strategic approach should visualise, consider and define the kind of tourism we want to see in Antarctica.  Such an approach should be aimed at achieving forward-looking, environmentally well-managed and sustainable tourism and some participants commented that this should be subject to a comprehensive, consistent and robust management framework. One response underlined the importance of “anticipating tourism developments to the extent possible before they occur”. The value of tourism as an educational and outreach tool was noted.  It was observed that a strategic approach should focus not only on the problems raised by Antarctic tourism, but also be proactive in deciding how to solve these problems. A strategic approach would need to remain broad enough to be able to provide consistency in treatment, with the ability to focus and apply that approach to specific areas of concern as they arose. Reviews should take account of the range of management measures already developed and deployed in the ATCM toolkit, but should also include analysing whether the current regulations are comprehensive enough to cover new types of tourism, such as airborne commercial activities. 
 Finally, participants noted that any strategic approach should always be framed by the values expressed in Article 3 of the Protocol, namely the protection of the Antarctic environment for its aesthetic, wilderness and scientific values which must be fundamental considerations when planning any activity in Antarctica. It was further pointed out by one Party that ‘translation’ of “Article 3 values and 2009 General Principles of Antarctic Tourism into proactive policy on the more “specific areas of concern” appears a logical and valuable next step towards a strategic tourism approach”. The same party raised the question of whether “additional regulations be adopted in respect of permanent facilities for tourism in Antarctic (such as hotels), for instance, to prevent further degradation of Antarctica’s wilderness values or to limit the risk of future ownership conflicts?”
2	What would we do differently as a result of adopting a strategic approach?
Participants noted that a strategic approach should set clear expectations around the kind of tourism the system is prepared to support, enhance long-term planning of tourism management and result in a more standardised application of the rules and regulations adopted by the ATCM.  Particular emphasis was placed by participants on the importance of knowledge gathering and information sharing, with improving the exchange of information on tourism operations between Parties seen as essential. There was broad support for a comprehensive, readily accessible and user-friendly database with information on frequently-visited sites, visitor numbers and means of transportation. Other suggestions included making more effective use of some of the tools already available to the ATCM, using the multi-year strategic work plan to frame the discussion, and utilising the CEP more generally as a forum for discussion on the effective implementation of the Protocol with respect to tourism. There was also the practical suggestion of creating a central location for all the rules and regulations pertaining to tourism, with emphasis placed on developing stronger guidelines and a common set of criteria to allow tourism activities to be assessed in a more standardised manner. One party suggested consideration of a fixed tax for tourists on a per capita per day basis, although this was questioned by others. Finally, some Parties also suggested there was a need to reach a common understanding as to what is included in the definition of a tourist, tourism and non-governmental acitivites. 
3	What are the priority areas and gaps?
The participants identified a number of potential priority areas: 
    • Developing a shared vision for the future of Antarctic tourism, including defining and prioritising what types of tourism this would encompass;
    • Reaching a common understanding of the relevant terms, including tourist, visitor, tourism, and non-governmental activities;
    • Development of a work plan focused on tourism;
    • Improving the information exchange and cooperation between the competent authorities of Contracting Parties to the Protocol; 
    • Improving the measurement and management of cumulative impacts;
    • Increasing and encouraging the level of monitoring of tourism activities; 
    • How best to prevent or regulate the further expansion of tourism activities in Antarctica; 
    • Considering additional regulations in respect of permanent facilities for tourism; and
    • The need for a strategic view on the future for commercial aviation activity in Antarctica and consideration of a comprehensive framework for managing such activities. 
4	What could be the possible pathways for arriving at this approach? 
Most participants favoured developing a tourism work plan as a means of focusing and directing discussion on the various issues, with the suggestion to incorporate this into the ATCM’s multi-year strategic work plan. Once priority areas and gaps have been identified and agreed upon, they should be placed in the work plan to allow Parties to prepare for and engage in substantial discussions at the Meetings. It should also allow time for issues to be referred to the CEP where warranted. Breaking up the issue into broad thematic areas was proposed as an efficient way to frame the issue, with ‘tourism and the environment’, ‘tourism and safety’, and ‘tourism and competent authorities’ put forward as suggestions. 
A full summary of the responses is attached as Annex 1; however, the priority areas and gaps can be broadly categorised into three groups: information management; monitoring and measuring current activities; and managing the diversification of tourism. Below, more detailed comment is provided and recommendations put forward by participants for consideration for inclusion in a programme of work are compiled. 
Information management
There was a clear desire for competent authorities to have more and better information at hand when considering authorisations of activities.  This would inform future discussions with respect to best practice environmental impact assessment and risk management, and build confidence in system-wide management of the risks associated with tourism. 
Specific proposals which received some support included:
    • Development of a forum for the improvement of information exchange and cooperation between competent authorities.  
    • Enhancement of existing tools into a comprehensive database of information relating to tourism activities, which would include:
        ◦ Existing rules and regulations;
        ◦  Information on sites (including site sensitivities, risks to wildlife, hazards etc ;
        ◦  Visitor numbers;
        ◦ Means of transportation;
        ◦ Types of activities;
        ◦ Compliance mechanisms for Measure 4 (2004), as appropriate; and
        ◦ Information on permitting applications received and the final decisions made on those applications, including denials.
    • Development of a Measure regarding compulsory notification to other competent authorities when the activities of a tour operator registered in a Party uses, or is likely to use, the resources of another National Antarctic Programme.
Monitoring and measuring current activities
In order to collect the information necessary to make informed decisions on tourism, the need for further monitoring and measuring of tourism activities was identified. It was noted that monitoring is not always considered as high a priority for national programmes, and that incentives could be considered as a way to encourage it to be undertaken more. Some participants noted concern at additional costs that may be associated with monitoring and urged that the need for data be closely defined.  Others noted that monitoring of authorised activities was a responsibility under Article 3 of the Environmental Protocol. As was observed in the 2012 CEP Tourism Study, access to independent, reliable and complete data on all forms of Antarctic tourism are hard to obtain, with the ATCM instead reliant mainly on the statistics and information published at the end of each season by IAATO.  However, a number of participants noted the increase in tourist activities by non-members of IAATO which may not be reflected in IAATO’s end of season statistics.  
Participants suggested that increasing scientific-based monitoring of sites frequently visited by tourists would provide a more detailed understanding of the activities that occur in those areas. More systematic monitoring would enable the measuring of a broad range of potential impacts at these sites which could further inform policy discussions and decisions, as well as contribute to the development or improvement of site guidelines for tourism sites. One participant suggested that while increasing and encouraging the level of monitoring of tourism activities, “data collection should follow a mutually agreed upon management framework”.
Specific proposals which received some support included:
    • Enhanced monitoring of sites at risk of potential impacts from tourism be conducted and incentivised, along with scientific research analysing any identified impacts.
    • That such information gathered should be made available to Parties.
Managing diversification
In person numbers, tourism has moved from a small to a significant activity in Antarctica.  In the past 10 years there has been an increase in the variety and amount of land-based activities, particularly with respect to “adventure tourism”. As many participants noted, this is changing the risk profile of Antarctic tourism both with respect to environmental impacts and emergency response. Simultaneously, the ability to monitor and verify compliance with authorisations has been challenged. Many participants expressed their concerns that this situation has evolved beyond the current toolkit of the ATCM.  A number of participants noted specifically the first landing in Antarctica undertaken by a commercial airliner during the 2015/16 season. It was further suggested that issues around the development of private infrastructure (hotels, camps, runways etc.) on Antarctica should be discussed, including the current proposal for a private operator to develop a runway at Romnoes, Dronning Maud Land in East Antarctica.
Participants in the ICG generally agreed that there should be a focus on improving the current tools and many expressed doubt that the existing regulatory framework provided Parties with adequate tools to manage diversification of tourism. Tools available under the Environmental Protocol were particularly identified as in need of strengthening. Suggestions included extending the Annex I assessment process to tourism sites in regular use and better utilising the protected area tools under Annex V, with the understanding that there needs to be a discussion about the appropriateness of using ASPAs in this way. A number of participants noted that industry self-regulation appeared to be at its limits. There was also recognition that Parties should be open to discussing and considering the adoption of new instruments, with a focus on those areas where there is a demonstrable need to act. Participants mentioned specifically three key areas that could be considered for enhanced regulation: sites, tourist numbers, and types of activities. 
Specific proposals which received some support included:
    • That Parties actively consider how to strengthen the current tools to be more applicable to tourism and discuss the possibility of developing and adopting additional regulatory instruments specifically addressing diverse types of sites of tourist activities.

Conclusion – next steps 
Agreement on a common vision of Antarctic tourism was identified by most participants as a core priority. It is recommended that this discussion takes place at an early stage of the programme of work. 
Given the ongoing support for the recommendations of the CEP’s tourism study, a comprehensive approach to their implementation should be prioritised. A review of progress to date should take place, followed by the setting of a work plan for implementation.  One party noted that such a review should be set in the context of the development of a common vision for Antarctic tourism.  This should be followed by a review of efficacy. 
Drawing on work undertaken previously, the question of whether new regulation is required, and what type of regulation, should be considered shortly after the above actions.
Many ICG participants suggested that the multi-year strategic work plan should be utilised to establish a roadmap for policy-making at future ATCMs. By populating the work plan, Parties will be able to properly prepare for the discussions that would allow the ATCM to move beyond identifying the issues relating to tourism and into identifying solutions. 

Recommendations
    1. It is recommended that the ATCM:
        a. Consider the report of the ICG;
        b. Agree to commence work to develop a common vision of Antarctic tourism at ATCM XL;
        c. Conduct a comprehensive review of progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2012 CEP Tourism Study, and agree to a work plan to implement outstanding areas of work; and
        d. Agree to a multi-year work plan focused on tourism.
