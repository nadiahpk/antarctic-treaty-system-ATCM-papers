A methodology to assess the sensitivity of sites used by visitors: prioritising future management attention
Working paper submitted by Australia, New Zealand, Norway and the United States.

Summary
The CEP’s report on Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic: Environmental Aspects and Impacts (CEP Tourism Study) recommended that a method of assessing the sensitivity of sites to tourist visitation be developed, to inform analyses of relative sensitivity and to assess appropriate management needs. The ATCM requested the CEP to advance this recommendation as a matter of priority. This paper provides an update on work by Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States, towards a method for assessing the sensitivity of sites to tourist visitation, with a view to assisting the CEP in prioritising management attention. The authors would welcome feedback on this work, and invite Members to engage in further development of this method in the next intersessional period.
Background
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States are working to develop a simple, readily-applied method for assessing the sensitivity of sites to visits by tourists. The objective is to assist the CEP to identify those sites that may benefit from further management attention. 
This work follows directly from the 2012 CEP Tourism Study, which noted that: 
    • “no methodology has been agreed by the Treaty Parties to distinguish between tourist sites in terms of their relative environmental sensitivities. A more thorough and quantifiable assessment of relative site sensitivities would provide a firmer basis for site-specific management”; and
    • “[i]nformation on tourist site sensitivities is not held centrally; the state of knowledge is highly variable between sites and is not readily available to managers and the CEP / ATCM”.

As a result, the Tourism Study recommended (Recommendation 3) that:
    • “An appropriate method of assessing site sensitivity should be developed and a relative sensitivity analysis undertaken for at least the most heavily visited sites in Antarctica, including, for example, consideration of the vulnerability of tourist sites to non-native species establishment, for the purpose of more rigorously assessing appropriate management needs.  Site sensitivity considerations should also be included in the Environmental Impact Assessment process for tourism activities.”
ATCM XXXV (2012) requested the CEP to advance this recommendation as a matter of priority. This is reflected in the CEP 5-year work plan, which identifies addressing the recommendation as a Priority 1 task. The author group has reported on related work at subsequent CEP meetings, including in ATCM XXXVII/WP17, ATCM XXXVII/IP12 and ATCM XXXVIII/IP103. 
A methodology to assess the sensitivity of sites used by visitors 
The sensitivity of a site to visits by tourists will be influenced by a range of environmental, geographic and temporal factors, which makes it challenging to develop an assessment method that is practical and reproducible. As a practical first step, the authors have sought to establish a simple method that considers the presence of values, and the potential for normal tourism activity to have an impact on those values (see Attachment 1).
The method involves:
    1) Using available information to identify key values/features present at a site. The draft methodology seeks to address the broad categories of values/features that were identified in the CEP Tourism Study: ice-free ground, wildlife, vegetation, historic sites, and scientific values. In addition, the methodology allows for consideration of other environmental values identified in the Protocol or otherwise recognised by the CEP. Further consideration could be given to the inclusion of other values, and to a system of weighting values deemed more important than others. 
The values present at a site and, consequently, the site’s sensitivity to tourism visitation can vary across time (e.g. with the seasonal presence or absence of breeding seabirds or mammals). To accommodate this temporal variation, where relevant, a site’s sensitivity can be assessed at more than one point in the season (e.g. its early-season condition, and separately in its late-season condition).
    2) Applying expert judgement to consider whether there is an appreciable risk that the identified values/features might be affected by ‘normal’ tourism activity. For the purposes of this exercise, ‘normal’ tourism activity has been considered to be ‘The generally practiced model of landing of passengers ashore, for moving around in small guided groups, or where appropriate free roaming or following marked routes, with closer supervision by guides at key locations as necessary.’
This assessment must take into consideration the layout and topography of the site (size of the site, terrain), the location and arrangement of site values (flora and fauna, colony extents) and access points and routes (landing sites, routes or navigable pathways, dangerous areas), which will influence how visitors may interact with site values. 
The assessment of sensitivity is conducted independent of any site-specific management arrangements, but with the general assumptions that that:
    • visits are conducted in accordance with applicable ATCM-agreed general measures;
    • visitors do not enter any ASPA at or near the site or, where permitted to enter, do so in accordance with the ASPA management plan; and
    • visitors abide by any applicable ASMA management plan.
    3) Using the results to provide an assessment of each site’s sensitivity to disturbance from tourism activity. 
The method is not intended to be used to prescribe specific management arrangements for any particular site, but rather as a systematic approach to drawing on available information and expert judgement to assess the sensitivity of sites to tourist visitation, with a view to assisting the CEP in prioritising management attention. The assessments of sensitivity could be revisited as further information becomes available, such as through comprehensive site inventories or baseline studies of sites, or to incorporate the results of research into visitor/site interactions. 
Next steps
The authors will continue to work to develop the method, incorporating any feedback from Members, and in consultation with stakeholders including industry operators and those with site expertise. We would welcome additional participants in this work. Following further development to reflect input received, our intention is to apply the method to the most heavily visited sites, consistent with Recommendation 3 of the CEP Tourism Study, and to bring forward the method and results for consideration by the CEP. 
Recommendations
The authors invite Members to provide feedback on the approach outlined in this paper to inform further work in the 2016/17 intersessional period. Members are also invited to engage in the further development of this method ahead of CEP XX.
