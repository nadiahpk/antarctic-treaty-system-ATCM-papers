Templates to summarise the prior assessment of a proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) or Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) for subsequent consideration by the CEP

A Working Paper submitted by United Kingdom and Norway
Summary
At CEP XVIII the Committee agreed that it would be useful to have available relevant information on the proposed designation of an ASPA or ASMA, after the proponent has assessed the suitability of the area using the ‘Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3 of Annex V of the Environmental Protocol’, but prior to the submission to the CEP of a draft protected area Management Plan.  At the meeting the Committee adopted Guidelines: A prior assessment process for the designation of ASPAs and ASMAs (CEP XVIII Final Report, Appendix 3).  Building on these guidelines, and in order to help proponents of new ASPA and ASMA designations summarise their findings in a consistent way, the United Kingdom and Norway propose that the CEP now considers recommending the non-mandatory use of two short templates (as detailed in Appendix A and B).  
Background
At CEP XVIII the Committee agreed to a set of guidelines (CEP XVIII Final Report, Appendix 3) on a prior assessment process as a desired, but not mandatory, procedure to be used to enable the CEP to undertake a prior assessment of new ASPA and ASMA designations1.  The guidelines recommend that the CEP be informed, at as early a stage as possible, of relevant information including:
    • The proposed location of the ASMA/ASPA.
    • The initial rationale behind the plans for proposing the designation, including specifying the legal basis for the designation found in Annex V; how it improves the representativeness of the protected areas network, and how it fits within the ACBR planning tool.
    • Other relevant information relating to the development of a Management Plan that the proponent country has available at the time of submission to the CEP meeting.  
Templates to summarise the assessment process of proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas
Parties, the CEP, CCAMLR, COMNAP or SCAR may choose to provide information to the Committee on any proposed ASPAs or ASMAs one or more years prior to the formal initiation of the mandatory protected area designation process.  Should the proponent(s) decide to do this, a template might prove useful to help the proponent(s) communicate a summary of their initial findings and to assist the CEP in its consideration of the proposed justification for a protected area using a standard format.

With these objectives in mind, United Kingdom and Norway have taken into consideration the criteria contained within Annex V to the Protocol and the information within the ‘Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3 of Annex V of the Environmental Protocol’ and produced two short templates, provided in Appendix A and B to this Working Paper, to summarise the proponent’s findings, including those resulting from the conduct of the process described in the guidelines.  
Recommendation
The United Kingdom and Norway propose that the CEP considers recommending the non-mandatory use of two short templates (as detailed in Appendix A and B) to provide for a standardised presentation of new ASMA or ASPA designations, where the proponent(s) decide it would be helpful to engage the Committee in a prior assessment discussion, as envisaged in the Guidelines: A prior assessment process for the designation of ASPAs and ASMAs (CEP XVIII Final Report, Appendix 3).

areas with important or unusual assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native birds or mammals

(d)
the type locality or only known habitat of any species

(e)
areas of particular interest to ongoing or planned scientific research

(f)
examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features

(g)
areas of outstanding aesthetic and wilderness value

(h)
sites or monuments of recognised historic value

(i)
such other areas as may be appropriate to protect environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values, or ongoing or planned scientific research

10
Consideration as to whether the ASPA be used primarily for conservation or scientific research purposes:

17
Other relevant information from the assessment process:



1 In this context it is relevant to point to the ‘Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3 of Annex V of the Environmental Protocol’ (held under Resolution 1 (2000)), which includes guidance for such assessment processes.

N.B. For ASPAs with a substantial marine component, prior approval must be obtained from CCAMLR (Annex V, Article 6(2)).
