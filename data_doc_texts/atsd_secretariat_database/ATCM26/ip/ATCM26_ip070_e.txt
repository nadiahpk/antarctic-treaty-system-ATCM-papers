An Assessment of Environmental Emergencies
Arising from Activities in Antarctica
2002-2003 season


IAATO was asked to provide CEP periodic updates on environmental emergencies that have occurred on board tourist ships.

Background
Resolution 6 of ATCM XXII requested that COMNAP undertake an assessment of the risks of environmental emergencies arising from activities in Antarctica, including, but not limited to, an analysis of incidents, which have occurred over the past ten years within the Antarctic Treaty area. CEP II requested that IAATO provide relevant information with regard to environmental emergencies resulting from tourist vessels. IAATO provided XII SATCM IP11 to CEP III and an additional update to CEPV at ATCM XXV. 

During the 2002-2003 season the following incidents occurred. 
    • Aircraft: Adventure Network International- aircraft-Basler 67
