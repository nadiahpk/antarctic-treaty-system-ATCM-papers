    1. Introduction 
        1.1 Location of the Chinese Antarctic Station
China has two wintering Antarctic stations. Their locations are:
Great Wall Station: W 58゜57’52”;  S 62゜12’59”
Zhongshan Station: E 76゜22’40”;  S 69゜22’24”

        1.2   2002/2003 main activities in Antarctica
The 19th Chinese National Antarctic Expedition (2002/2003) was composed of 147 Chinese persons, including 12 wintering personnel at the Great Wall Station and 18 wintering personnel at the Zhongshan Station.
Several scientific research projects and logistic work were carried out at the Great Wall Station:
    • GPS international collaborative observation,
    • Study on the impact of human activities on the environment and ecology in King George Island 
    • Study on the feasibility of establishing the system of ecological monitoring at the Great Wall Station 
    • Installing the GOES Geostationary Satellite Data Acquisition and Processing System
    • Fundamental surveying and mapping
    • Installing the Broad Band Seismological Observation
    • Meteorological observation
    • Cleaning up the old Power Building and old generator
    • Planning and designing for the rebuilding of the Station
    • Repairing and maintaining of vehicles and buildings
    • Taking back all the construction waste and other solid waste.

The following projects were conducted at the Zhongshan Station:
    • Antarctic lakes, geology of the Larsemann Hills Region and Meteorite research
    • Geomagnetism observation
    • Installing the Broad Band Seismological Observation 
    • Comprehensive investigation in Grove Mountains 
    • Surveying and mapping in Grove Mountain
    • Study on the interaction between Amery Ice Shelf and Ocean
    • Research of the Antarctic Ice Sheet advance and retreat history since last glacial maximum 
    • Meteorology observation
    • Ozone observation
    • Upper atmosphere physics observation
    • GPS international collaborative observation
    • Planning and designing for the rebuilding of the Station 
    • Repairing and maintaining of generators and vehicles as well as buildings
    • Fixing the fitment inside the new living building 
    • Taking back the construction waste and other solid waste.

The following scientific projects were carried out during the voyage of the vessel “Xuelong”.
    • Geochemical trace by isotope
    • Biological oceanography 
    • Study on the biological characteristics of polar microorganism and the prospect of their application
    • Acoustic abundance estimation of the living marine resources in the Southern Ocean
    • Study on marine chemistry, carbon cycling and geochemistry of biogenic elements in the Prydz Bay
    • Study on the exchange of carbon dioxide between air and sea 
    • Study on aerosol chemistry over the Antarctica and the Southern Ocean
    • Observation of sea ice 
    • Study on gene characterization and biodiversity
    • Observation of the Pacific-Indian Ocean warm pool
    • ADCP, XBT/XCTD observation

    2.  The environmental impact assessment
According to the Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol, all Chinese Antarctic activities are requested to provide an EIA report before the projects are proceeded in Antarctica. All the EIA reports of the projects, which would be carried out in 2002/2003 Antarctic season, were evaluated and the activities were classified as “less than a minor or transitory impact” on the Antarctic environment. So, they can be conducted in Antarctica without IEE or CEE requested.

    3. Protection of flora and fauna in Antarctica
All the persons are asked to avoid disturbing birds and animals whether or not they proceed their work at station and in the field. The driver must drive the vehicle on the existing road and avoid damaging the flora on the ground. The scientific research activities should take care of the animals’ breeding and resting area. Waste foods are prohibited to expose outside building in case they could become the comestible supply to birds.

4.Waste management
4.1 The solid waste materials were divided into 4 catalogues and treated in different ways at the two stations.
    • Combustible materials were not permitted to store in the station for a long time. They were burned in the incinerator after being recorded. The remains were put in case and would be transported back to China.
    • Metal, plastic and other non-combustible materials were collected and piled to be transported back to China;
    • Glass materials were smashed into pieces and put into cases to be transported back to China
    • Battery useless was collected into cases and would be transported back to China.

4.2 The daily domestic liquid waste was treated in the sewage treatment system and then discharged into the sea.

4.3 No radioactive materials were used at the stations in 2002/2003 Antarctic season.

5. Prevention of marine pollution
All the wastes on the vessel “Xuelong”, including the daily domestic liquid waste and the solid waste, were treated according to the related regulations of the IMO.

    6. The function of the equipment
Sewage treatment system and incinerator are installed at the two stations respectively. The sewage treatment system can automatically function 24 hours per day. After the sewage outlet water is treated, it is discharged into sea at the Great Wall station and on the shoreline at the Zhongshan station.
The incinerator at each station runs well. It uses two burners. All harmful emissions from the incinerator are reduced to maximum extent practicable.

7. Protection measures to be taken
        7.1 The environmental officers were appointed at two stations, who are in charge of the environmental management in the Antarctic stations.
        7.2 Before going to Antarctica, all the members of the expedition were trained on the environmental protection in Antarctica. The operators were trained how to manipulate the incinerator and the sewage treatment system.
        7.3 The maintaining and repairing of the vehicles and generators were done in the buildings. All the useless spare parts were collected to be stored for transporting back to China. Useless oil was concentrated in the drum.
        7.4 All the people working in the field outside the stations were asked to take back the rubbish to the stations.
        7.5 All the pipelines and valves were checked in order to prevent the leakage of oil.
        7.6 The expeditioners worked in Grove Mountain were asked to follow the regulation on the usage and management of meteorite. All the food waste and human excrement were collected and taken back to the station for disposal.

8.Environmental Accident
One case of oil spill occurred at the Great Wall Station due to the wrong operation of the engineer when he transported the oil from the ship to the tank. About 2 liters of oil was spilled, which was removed by absorbent material. No danger occurred.

9.IEE
No IEE. 

10.International Cooperation
Mr. Wang Shuguang, director-general of the State Oceanic Administration, led a delegation to visit Peru, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina for enhancing the collaboration in polar research in the end of 2002. Meanwhile, the Peruvian Antarctic Institute and the State Oceanic Administration of the People’s Republic of China have come to an agreement on scientific, technological and logistic cooperation in Antarctic matters. Moreover, International cooperation was made between Romania and China. Teodor Negoita, the Director of the Romanian Polar Institute, attended the 19th Chinare and did some research work in chemistry, biology, and etc in Antarctica with the collaboration of Chinese scientists.
