REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
OF ANTARCTICA TOUR OPERATORS (IAATO)
2002-2003 

Under Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty


The International Association Of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities to ATCM XXVI, Madrid, Spain, 9-20 June 2003 in relation to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty.

IAATO is a member organization founded in 1991 to advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic. IAATO has succeeded in developing a successful working relationship with most commercial tour operators, has established best practices in order to minimize environmental impacts and maintain the wilderness aesthetic quality of Antarctica. IAATO has been effective in setting self-imposed limits on its members. IAATO is an accreditation organization whereby all companies are voted in by Full Members based on their commitment and responsible practices. IAATO seeks to raise the operational standards of all members and the industry as a whole. IAATO’s agreed objectives are listed in Appendix E. All Members are business competitors of one another and therefore striving for excellence is of particular importance for most companies.

Over the last year IAATO has continued to focus its activities in several key areas:
    • Improved data collection and exchange of information among its members,
    • Outreach to non members,
    • Improved vessel communication methods via the GMDSS and INM-C system for safety and itinerary planning purposes, 
    • Development of Site Specific Guidelines to address impacts and concern towards growth in the tourism industry,
    • Stressed the concern towards the potential spreading of Antarctic diseases and prevention methods, 
    • Enhancement of operating instructions,
    • Participation in Intersessional Working groups, 
    • Furthering the development of the IAATO-Wide Contingency Planning,
    • Addressed specific issues of Antarctic tourism, including high-risk ventures,
    • Participation in international meetings and liaison with National Antarctic programs, government agencies of the sub-Antarctic island groups, and scientific and environmental organizations.



New Discoveries

In the Antarctic Peninsula Region a new discovery was made by the officers on the MV "Bremen" on February 2, 2003.  Omega Island (64º20’S, 62º56’W) in the Melchior Islands group, thought to be one island but it is actually two islands split by a channel of water. IAATO Member Company Hapag Lloyd’s personnel provided this information to the Geodaesie and Cartographie in Germany and to the Alfred Wegener Institute. Detailed information will be provided to the IHO/IHB.

On November 26, 2002, during Shokalskiy’s first voyage to the Sub-Antarctic Islands, Heritage Expeditions team found that significant recent volcanic activity at McDonald Island in the Indian Ocean had completely changed the shape and nature of the Island.  Heritage Expeditions permit did not allow the group to land, however the changes were photographed, sketched and recorded in detail. This information was reported to the Australian Antarctic Division.

2 	2002-2003 Tourism Statistics

2.1	From November 2002 to March 2003, a total of 10,592 tourists landed in the Antarctic by privately organized IAATO Member companies, including passengers aboard 20 commercially organized small expedition vessels and 180 land-based visitors. In addition, 2424 tourists travelled on 3 IAATO-Member large cruise vessels (3 departures) that did not land tourists and spent approximately 72 hours each trip south of 60ºS in Antarctica.  

Non-Member activities include approximately 2,799 tourists who landed in Antarctica on three non-member vessels and one company operating a land based-aircraft fly-in program.

2.2	Tourism numbers have increased some since the 2001-2002 season but have not reached the millennium peak from the 1999-2000 season. Tourism activities and actual numbers of non-members, however have become more available over the years and therefore overall numbers are somewhat higher this year. A detailed “Overview of Antarctic Tourism” paper is presented as a separate information paper to ATCM XXVI under Agenda Item 10.

3 	IAATO’s Participation in Organized Meetings during 2002-2003

3.1	IAATO held its 14th General Meeting from May 5-9, 2003, in Seattle, Washington, USA. Some 80 people from 41 member companies of IAATO including the new Provisional and Associate Member applicants, 1 non-member tour operator plus 15 government, conservation and private organizations attended the meeting. The complete agenda can be found on IAATO’s website at www.iaato.org. Several companies sponsored the attendance of their expedition leaders, which proved useful for better field communication and understanding of the industry as a whole. Included in this year’s agenda was a discussion on the Arctic and enhanced coordination of Arctic activities in areas such as Svalbard where tourism similarities exist. 

Attending this meeting were representatives from the United Kingdom (Foreign and Commonwealth Office-Polar Regions Section, United Kingdom Overseas Territories, British Antarctic Survey), United States Antarctic Program/National Science Foundation, Raytheon Polar Services, Umwelt Bundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency-Germany), Antarctica New Zealand, New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, Antarctic Non Governmental Activity News (ANAN), World Wildlife Fund Arctic, Lakehead University, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and University of Tasmania. In addition, expedition staff and private individuals attended. 

3.2 	IAATO will hold its 15th General Meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2004. (The final dates will be decided upon notification of dates for ATCM XXVII.) The 16th General Meeting is currently planned for Ushuaia in 2005. Interested parties that would like to participate should contact the IAATO Secretariat at iaato@iaato.org.

        3.3 An IAATO representative from IAATO Member Company-Aurora Expeditions attended the State of the Environment Workshop, Sydney, 2003. 

        3.4 Several IAATO members met with their various governments during the last year to discuss tourism issues in the Antarctic and Arctic.  Feedback from members felt that these meetings proved useful for the tour operators to hear about their government concerns or issues. IAATO encourages Parties to interact with their resident tour operators whenever possible so that both stakeholders can gain a better understanding of each other’s concerns. This also helps dissipate the overwhelming amount of misinformation found in various news sources worldwide. 

4	Field Coordination

4.1	Provided IAATO receives the information, aircraft, vessel call data and schedules from any tour company will probably be included in IAATO’s yearly exchange of information consisting of: vessel contact information, overall ship schedules, emergency contact information and yearly Antarctic tourism reports. 

4.2	Vessel Call Data and ship schedules are shared with COMNAP for purposes of updating COMNAP’s MINIATOM.  The MINIATOM is extremely useful for tour operators when trying to contact stations or other vessels. IAATO transports numerous scientists to Antarctica each year in addition to requesting tourist visits to stations. It is helpful when station contact information is up to date for communication, planning and emergency purposes.

4.3	Preliminary detailed cruise itineraries are compiled by the IAATO Secretariat and distributed to Antarctic tour operators, national Antarctic programs where appropriate, COMNAP, SCAR and In.Fue.Tur in advance of the season.

4.4	Expedition leaders and ship's officers circulate advance itineraries and maintain regular contact throughout the season to coordinate site visits and exchange general information such as ice conditions, weather, landing recommendations, concern about potential environmental impacts etc. A key factor in managing Antarctic tourism and mitigating potential environmental impact is to ensure that no two ships land passengers at the same place and the same time. An example of the annual instructions to ships’ captains, radio officers and expedition leaders is included as Appendix A. 

4.5	Routine contact between vessels and with Adventure Network’s Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response office in Punta Arenas (EMER) is a key component of effective emergency response and self-sufficiency. Details on IAATO’s EMER have been presented at previous ATCMs.  One ship operating company used Chilean airlines DAP for their emergency back up plan. 


5	Environmental Impact Assessment 

5.1	Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States, Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway all received Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA’s) from IAATO members operating vessels or land-based programs. All IAATO members conducting activities that 	required an EIA submitted sufficient documentation.

5.2	IAATO urges Contracting Parties to ensure that obligations of the Environmental Protocol are being met and Environmental Impact Assessments from non-members of IAATO are being submitted. IAATO is concerned about non-member activities. During the 2002-2003 season several member vessels observed non-member sailing vessels with tourists walking through penguin colonies and trampling moss beds. 

5.3	IAATO would like to request that when non-member companies submit EIA’s that governments be wary of reference statements such as “We follow all IAATO Guidelines.” It isn’t possible for non-members to have the breadth or understanding of the numerous operating strategies IAATO has developed over the years. This statement appeared in some non-member IEE’s during the 2002-2003 season and actually proved problematic. Non-members do not receive regular updates and briefings from IAATO. Some non-members are copied in on Vessel Call Data, itinerary sharing and some other impromptu issues. Governments permitting and or assessing non-member companies may need to provide additional information on suggested operating procedures or an observer to monitor environmental concerns.


6  	Procedures to Prevent the Introduction of Alien Organisms

6.1	For four seasons, IAATO’s Boot and Clothing Decontamination Recommended Guidelines have proved to be effective. These guidelines unofficially have been operative for the last ten years by most companies.

6.2	For three seasons, IAATO has used a standard protocol to report any high mortality incidents and to avoid the introduction and translocation of alien diseases. 
	
	Both the above-mentioned guidelines have been tabled previously as attachments at ATCM XXIV and ATCM XXV in IAATO’s annual report.


7	Reporting of Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities and Data Base

7.1	Antarctic tour operators made use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form that was updated and adopted by ATCM XXIV. Prior to moving ahead on the IAATO database we wanted to see how this form would work and if the data would be easily transferred into a database. IAATO anticipates the direct input capability to be operational for the 2003-2004 season. However we will probably need to make additional amendments to the Post Visit Site Report to reflect the increased number of activities and in order to “code” it properly. IAATO will propose changes to ATCM XXVII if everything proceeds as planned. Some Contracting Parties are still referencing forms agreed to at ATCM XXI in discussion with non-members of IAATO. The ATCM approved form is attached as Annex J to the Final Report at ATCM XXIV and can be found electronically on the IAATO website. New sites will be added each year to the drop down menus prior to November 2003. There is both a MAC and PC compatible form.

7.2	IAATO continues to support the continued use of this single form, which reduces the burden of paperwork and can facilitate the study of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourist activities. IAATO would like to encourage Parties to send IAATO and the US National Science Foundation a copy of any forms received from non-IAATO member operators in order for the data to be incorporated into the “Overview of Tourism.” This will provide for greater transparency of all tourist activities and will further the ability to address cumulative impact issues. This request was also made to ATCM XXV.

7.3	Overall IAATO supports the development of a relevant and effective tourism data-base. IAATO will develop this independently and would be interested in working with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat if appropriate should the ATS decide to further work in this area. Regardless compiling the information is very time consuming and assuring that all activities are reported will be challenging no matter what system is invented.


8	Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1-(Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic and Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic)

        8.1 IAATO’s standard operating procedures for implementing Recommendation XXVIII-1 include: 

    • Mandatory briefings take place on each tour ship prior to arrival in the Antarctic. This presentation consists of the IAATO slide or PowerPoint presentation. This presentation can be viewed on line at www.iaato.org under “Guidance for Visitors” on the home page. Most experienced Expedition Leaders will however enhance the presentation with additional slides. 
    • Tourists, ships’ command, crew and expedition staff receive paper copies of Recommendation XVIII-1 “Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic.” Some companies distribute this document in its pre-season materials in advance of departure, some once on board the tourist ship. Regardless all tourists are required to attend the briefing. Those not in attendance are talked to privately. Crew Members are also supposed to be fully briefed. 
    • These guidelines are available to members from IAATO in English, Chinese (Mandarin), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish. Should any Antarctic Treaty Parties have translated this document into languages not listed above please submit copies to the IAATO Secretariat in order to better educate our traveling public. IAATO has committed time and resources to update the appearance of these guidelines and probably the slide show for the 2003-2004 season.

8.2	Recommendation XVIII-1, “Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic” is provided to all IAATO tour operators to inform members of key obligations and procedures to be followed.


9	Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning

9.1	During the IAATO 14th General Meeting the IAATO-Wide Emergency Contingency Plan was agreed upon.  This plan has been submitted as a separate paper to ATCM XXVI. The shared vessel information in this plan is essential for effective response action.

9.2	IAATO has compiled data on tour vessels’ specifications and other information that would contribute to risk assessment of Antarctic tourism activities. This list is updated yearly and can be used in coordination with COMNAP if needed.

9.3	All IAATO member companies have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEP) in place that satisfies regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL. A “Special Antarctic Addendum” to the SOPEP was developed by IAATO and distributed to Antarctic tour operators for implementation and comment in 1998 (ATCM XXII IP104). While the addendum has no legal status, it includes notice to contact Antarctic stations in the vicinity of any marine pollution incident along with appropriate national authorities. The above-mentioned IAATO-Wide Emergency Contingency Planning will be an additional document under the SOPEP.

9.4	The IAATO-wide EMER (Emergency Medical Evacuation Response) plan has been in place for at least 5 seasons in order to reduce the need to impact scientific stations in the Antarctic Peninsula with medical-related tourist problems. A standard medical information checklist has been provided to new Members upon request in order to assure adequate medical supplies are available.

10	2002-2003 Scientific and Information Support 

10.1	IAATO member companies continue to provide logistic and scientific support to national Antarctic programs and to the Sub-Antarctic Islands. Tour vessels provide a cost-effective resource for the scientific community. During the 2002-03 season at least 150 scientists, gear and other personnel from various National Antarctic programs were provided transport to and from stations, field sites and gateway ports. Antarctic Treaty Parties chartered or used at least five IAATO member vessels for station resupply during the 2002-2003 season. A partial list of support is included as Appendix D. Further descriptions are noted below.

Quark Expeditions (United States) operating the Icebreaker vessel Kapitan Khlebnikov provided the following support:
    • Kapitan Khlebnikov was chartered by the Australian Antarctic Division prior to the tourist season
    • Kapitan Khlebnikov assisted Italian Antarctic Programme’s vessel Italica which was beset in ice near Terra Nova Bay on January 23, 2003. The Italica was then able to reach open water and sail 
    • 3 Scientists were transported to Casey Station
    • 6 Scientists or personnel were transported to Macquarie Island plus gear
    • 14 Field Personnel were transported for Antarctica New Zealand either to or from New Zealand or McMurdo to Cape Adare plus 3 tons of gear
    • 1 Scientist was transported on behalf of US-NSF from McMurdo to New Zealand

Hapag Lloyd (Germany) transported 27 Scientists or Field Personnel on either Bremen or Hanseatic for the following institutions:
    • Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) to/from Jubany 
    • University of Jena - Institute of Ecology to/from Bellingshausen
    • Deutsches Zentrum fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) from / to O'Higgins
    • Individual Science Personnel were transported from Port Stanley to South Georgia

Heritage Expeditions (New Zealand) operating the vessel Shokalskiy assisted in the following scientific projects:
    • Deployed approximately 30 "Argo" buoys through the South Indian and Southern Ocean for the University of Washington
    • Deployed 2 weather buoys for New Zealand Meteorological Service
    • Worked on a project with University of Tasmania assessing the wash/wake of tourist vessels transiting the "Narrows" in Bathhurst Harbour Wilderness area of Southern Tasmania
    • Worked with the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries on a reporting/recording scheme for fishing vessels in the Southern Ocean
    • Transported 11 scientists to/from the NZ Sub-Antarctic Islands of Campbell, Snares, and Auckland Islands to service the automatic meteorological stations

Peregrine Shipping (Australia) 
    • Worked with the Shirshov Institute of Russia and transported 34 scientists on the repositioning voyage from Russia to Ushuaia and 3 scientists on the return voyage 
    • Three oceanographers sailed on board and undertook temperature and salinity probes enroute to Ushuaia and through the Drake Passage and in Antarctic waters.

Lindblad Expeditions continued its support of the Oceanites Antarctic Site Inventory Project whose personnel were again provided with accommodations, transport and access to visitor sites.

Polar Star Expeditions carried two teams of Ukrainian scientists to and or from Vernadskiy and a group of Bulgarian scientists and government representatives (Foreign Ministry) to the Bulgarian St. Kliment Ohridski station.

10.2	Specific requests for logistic or other support should be made to individual members or the IAATO Secretariat. For a complete membership directory, please refer to the IAATO website at www.iaato.org.

10.3	Numerous companies update the IHO/IHB yearly with chart information. IAATO is planning on attending the IHO meeting in September 2003.   An IHB representative attended the 2002 IAATO meeting and IAATO looks forward to a productive exchange of information. Several companies who operate ships in polar regions send chart updates and corrections yearly to the IHO.


11	Conservation Research, Academic and Political Support

Antarctic tour operators and passengers continued their tradition of direct financial contributions to many organizations active in Antarctica. See Appendix C.

Peregrine Adventures/Shipping provided passage and airfare on Ioffe for a postgraduate student to assist in studies of tourism and impacts. 

Peregrine Adventures/Shipping provided 5 cabins for auction to various Australian charities (e.g. Cancer Research, Children’s Foundations etc).
	
Abercrombie and Kent/Explorer Shipping has provided continued support to the College of the Atlantic (Allied Whale Campaign) for numerous years. Lakehead University (Canada) students periodically travel on board the Explorer to further their Polar Studies and gain actual experience.

Canadian company ‘Students on Ice’ organized 70 teachers and students in December 2002 on board the Polar Star. Several of the students paused at the edge of an Antarctic glacier to call the Canadian Minister of the Environment by satellite phone to urge him to ratify the Environmental Protocol. Students on Ice (SOI) has been working closely with the Canadian government for many years to ratify the Protocol and is proving to be influential in their efforts. SOI has completed its third season taking 250 students, teachers and scientists from over 14 different countries on educational expeditions to both Polar Regions. 

Quark Expeditions sponsored an academic competition amongst High School students in Ushuaia. The three top students along with a chaperone were taken on a free trip to Antarctica.

Polar Star Expeditions sponsored at least 2 youths during the season. Upon return from Antarctica, South Georgia and Falklands (Malvinas), presentations were given by the participants to their respective schools.

As part of the Kershaw Kids Program, Adventure Network International took 6 children from 3 different continents to Patriot Hills.


12	With Thanks---Assistance by National Programs

The following countries or personnel provided assistance and operational guidelines to IAATO during the 2002-2003 season for which IAATO companies are grateful:

    • To ALL Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic station and island personnel who have welcomed our groups and provided a friendly, educational and rewarding experience for tourists.
    • Argentina: In.Fue.Tur for assisting all Companies and Expedition Leaders in schedule coordination and acting as an information source for IAATO vessels during the Antarctic season.
    • Brazil: Vessel Ary Rongel for assisting Oceanwide Expeditions with the incident involving the death of the scuba diver.
    • Chile: Vessel Oscar Viel for assisting the Clipper Adventurer at Deception Island.
    • Chile: Assisting Oceanwide Expeditions in searching for the ‘missing” man-overboard passenger off Cape Horn.
    • Chile: For the use of the Runway at Marsh/Frei for medical emergencies
    • Russia: Bellingshausen for assisting with logistics and support for the above mentioned scuba diving incident.
    • United Kingdom: UKFCO, BAS, Port Lockroy and South Georgia Museum Staff and officers for making visits to both places an extremely educational and enjoyable experience and for providing members with comprehensive guidelines for visits to BAS stations. Station guidelines are extremely useful to Expedition Leaders and staff so they know how to organize the passenger visit and minimize impacts (science and environmental) at the station. IAATO is grateful for the U.K’s support in limiting visits to stations to IAATO Members.
    • United States: National Science Foundation-Nadene Kennedy for compiling tourism data for the last 14 years, participating in IAATO meetings and coordinating US station visits.
    • And any others who we mistakenly missed on this list.


13	Observers on board IAATO member vessels 

IAATO requires that any Provisional or Probational Member companies are required to carry an observer before they are eligible to apply for Full Membership. IAATO prefers to use a qualified National Program Observer from the country in which the company is registered. When no national program observer is available, IAATO will appoint an appropriate person with experience in Antarctic matters, shipboard and or ecotourism related fields. IAATO has a checklist for observers. This checklist has been tabled at ATCM XXIV and ATCM XXV.  In addition, Resolution 5 (1995) Antarctic Treaty Inspection Checklist is also provided to the appointed observer. It is IAATO’s understanding that any observers appointed by National Programs would not be acting in an official capacity according to Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty but would simply be appointed as National Program representatives. IAATO vessels have been carrying observers since 1991. During the 2003-2004 season numerous observers will be required to sail on board IAATO Provisional Member vessels.

Expedition Leader And Ship’s Officers Seasonal Instructions

TO	All Antarctic Captains, Expedition Leaders and Radio Officers
FROM	IAATO
RE	2002-2003 Season

We updated the following information at the IAATO annual meeting to help guide the exchange of information among vessels, co-ordination of itineraries and reporting for the season. 

Exchange of Itineraries

    • IAATO members agree to exchange itineraries and coordinate schedules. This is a key factor in self-regulation, monitoring of activities and also in effective emergency response.
    • Consult the IAATO preliminary schedule (and updates circulated by In.Fue.Tur) to determine which vessels will be in your cruising area. 
    • Circulate your proposed final itinerary via GMDSS, telex by broadcast mode or radio (preferred) or fax or e-mail. (Please note that few tour vessels have regular real-time exchange of e-mail.) Since all ships are supposed to be equipped with a GMDSS radio station, they should be able to scan a frequency in the 6310 KZ band (24 hrs). By using broadcast mode (one way) ships can send itineraries, ice information and other information as needed. These transmissions will be picked up by all vessels and should be able to print out the incoming message immediately. 
    • Itineraries must be first communicated amongst vessels directly and secondarily circulated via In.Fue.Tur but this is a method of last resort. Not all ships call at Ushuaia and the responsibility to circulate information is between individual vessels.
    • Be sure to also exchange environmental information and management recommendations for individual landing sites or other notices with your colleagues as the season progresses.

Itinerary Changes

    • To avoid conflicts, notify vessels in the region of any changes in planned itinerary as soon as practicable. 
    • Notification should be by GMDSS first, then fax, telex, VHF or HF (see below).
    • Notify any vessel of intention to cancel a landing. Due to itinerary changes, weather, ice etc another vessel would appreciate having an additional landing option.

Landing Priority

    • In general, priority is given to the first vessel that has made its intentions known.
    • In the event of conflict, expedition leaders should co-ordinate between themselves to determine priority, which is best accomplished through negotiation via HF or VHF. 
    • Please resolve any conflicts equitably. It is assumed that vessels visiting a site with some regularity will give way to a vessel that is not but any number of factors may come into play. 
    • Two vessels are not to land at the same place at the same time and, to avoid any potential environmental impacts, efforts should be made to spread out visits over time.

Station Visits
    • Tour operators have agreed to provide 72-hour notice of any planned station visit.
    • Follow individual procedures determined by national programs/station leaders.
    • Provide timely notice of cancellation, generally 48 hours in advance.
    • Please include any additional station contact information, standard procedures or incidents involving stations in your voyage report to the home office.
    • No visits to Palmer Station are allowed on Sundays and preferably not on Saturdays. All Palmer visits have been prearranged. Any changes, please advise Palmer as soon as possible. There is an official Palmer Station schedule issued each season.
    • Visits to BAS Stations need to be pre-arranged through IAATO as per instructions by BAS.

Channel 16
    • Channel 16 is used for hailing purposes only, NOT general communication.
    • After making contact, immediately switch to another channel to continue conversation.
    • Expedition Leaders should periodically review radio etiquette with staff. The airwaves during the height of the season in the Peninsula have been crowded, an issue with IAATO members and potentially with research stations. Take care to follow standard international procedures.

IAATO Radio Schedule 
    • IAATO members have agreed to implement a once daily radio schedule at 1930.
    • All ships should report in with their position/destination at 1230 and 1930 daily using the GMDSS system (Ushuaia local time). Each radio officer should record this information.
    • Suggested HF hailing frequencies are: 4146 (1), 6224 (2)-SSB, 8294 (3), to be finalized by radio officers during the season based on experience. Use 6224 whenever possible.
    • Expedition leaders should make use of this schedule whenever VHF communication is impossible for exchange information. This will reduce communication costs.
    • Please switch to another frequency for any extended conversation when talking on the above-mentioned HF (4146, 6224).
    • Avoid long conversations over the radio if possible.
    • Protocol for the 1930 chat time: All parties wanting to sort out schedules please make yourselves known. Sort all itinerary business first and reschedule any other discussions for a later time. Non-IAATO members who simply want to “chat” should find another time and frequency. ELs not available to talk at this time should appoint another individual to monitor in case a ship is trying to reach you.

Radio Log On, GMDSS and INM-C Communication
    • Radio Log On: At the beginning of the season, ships should use the Radio Log Form and sign off when they have established contact with a specific ship. At the end of the season, the Log should be sent to IAATO together with all Post Visit Site Reports for evaluation.
    • GMDSS is the only reliable means of communication and it should be used daily by all ships.
    • Each vessel should report the noon position to each other via GMDSS or INM-C.
    • Since not all ships are equipped with GMDSS for all coverage, A1, A2, A3 and A4, ships without full coverage can only reliably communicate via inmarsat-C (INMC-C). Therefore it is important for each ship to pre-establish by what means they will be communicating with each other. The INM-C and the pre-established GMDSS radio telex frequency will allow ships to share information daily. In an emergency, it is the only reliable means of communication.

EMER (Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response)
    • Review the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan included in your briefing package.
    • The reporting scheme indicated above is an integral part of emergency response. Please insure that it is followed and report any difficulties to your home office.

Post-Visit Reporting
    • Following Antarctic Treaty recommendations, complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the standard Post-Visit Site Report for every expedition. The 2002-2003 version of the form should be the ONLY form completed for Antarctica. At the end of each voyage return the form and a computer disc to the home office. In order to input this information into the database, always submit a computer version of each form. Information gleaned from this form is tabulated and circulated internationally by the National Science Foundation, USA and by IAATO in the form of statistics. Copies of all completed forms must be submitted to the National Science Foundation and other relevant national programs and a copy sent to IAATO via the home office. 
    • The form is in EXCEL Format. After each trip both an Electronic Copy (on disc) and a hard copy needs to be filled out. Drop down menus have been created to make it easier for all concerned. Spend some time learning how to fill the form out on the computer. It does not need an original signature. EL’s can type their name directly on the form.
    • Do not include South Georgia landing site information on this form. There is a separate form for Antarctica. South Georgia forms need to be sent to the Government of South Georgia at the end of each voyage. 
    • Please note guests of the company, guest lecturers, and other “non-revenue passengers” should be reported as passengers for the purposes of this report unless they have specific staff roles ashore. In general, those responsible for supervising passenger operations ashore that report to the expedition leader are considered staff. Your office will provide additional guidance. Hotel staff, catering, chefs and deckhands are included as crew members, not staff, unless they are guiding tourists ashore and in Zodiacs.
    • The standard list of  “Antarctic Peninsula Region Landing Sites” for Part 2 has been incorporated into the drop down menus. If those sites are not included then please note them as new sites and we’ll add them to the list next year. Please correct duplications or inconsistencies. In general, the most specific place name is used. Most all the landing sites are in the drop down menus. Any new sites, type in the name of the site, latitude and longitude at the bottom. It may mean that chronologically from a “date” standpoint your landing sites may not be in order.
    • If you are visiting new sites then they will need to appear at the bottom of the list and will not necessarily appear in chronological order by date.
    • Make additions to the list of landing sites as necessary -- taking note of the standard procedures included in your briefing packet for assessing new or rarely visited sites.
    • EL’s, please note that this information is used for statistics that are tabled worldwide. Please do not hastily fill this out. If you have questions, consult your home office. 
    • If possible type the forms rather than hand write.
    • Please do not wait until the end of the season to send forms to IAATO and NSF. The earlier we get reports, the sooner we can compile the data. 

Have a safe and successful Antarctic season.

Appendix E
					IAATO’s Objectives 
(as agreed to in 1991)

    • To represent Antarctic tour operators and others organizing and conducting travel to the Antarctic to the Antarctic Treaty Parties, the international conservation community and the public at large. 
    • To advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible travel to the Antarctic. 
    • To circulate, promote and follow the Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic and Guidance for Those Organizing and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic, as adopted by the Antarctic Treaty System (Recommendation XVIII-1). 
    • To operate within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System, including the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on the Environment and Annexes, along with MARPOL, SOLAS and similar international and national laws and agreements. 
    • To foster continued cooperation among its members and to monitor IAATO programs, including the pattern and frequency of visits to specific sites within the Antarctic. And to coordinate itineraries so that no more than 100 people are ashore at any one time in any one place. 
    • To provide a forum for the international, private-sector travel industry to share expertise and opinions and to uphold the highest standards among members. 
    • To enhance public awareness and concern for the conservation of the Antarctic environment and its associated ecosystems and to better inform the media, governments and environmental organizations about private-sector travel to these regions. 
    • To create a corps of ambassadors for the continued protection of Antarctica by offering the opportunity to experience the continent first hand. 
    • To support science in Antarctica through cooperation with national Antarctic programs, including logistical support and research. 
    • To foster cooperation between private-sector travel and the international scientific community in the Antarctic. 
    • To ensure that the best qualified staff and field personnel are employed by IAATO members through continued training and education. And to encourage and develop international acceptance of evaluation, certification and accreditation programs for Antarctic personnel.
