        3.2 OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

A. STATIONS

    (1) Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station (EACF)

	The "Comandante Ferraz" Antarctic Station was constructed in Keller Peninsula, King George Island, on February of 1984, to provide support to Brazilian scientific activities. Geographical co-ordinates of the Station, which is open all year round, are 62o 05'S and 058o 23.5'W. The Ferraz Station  has more than 60 modules, which can accommodate a Base-Group of 10 military of the Brazilian Navy, who stay there for a uninterrupted period of 12 months, 24 researchers, during the summer, and up to 10 researchers during the winter.
	There is a doctor available all year long, surgery room, infirmary, and x-ray equipment. Dental emergency services and laboratory analysis can be provided. The infirmary has two beds for treatments that require intensive care. In emergencies situations, it can accommodate up to 20 extra people during the summer and up to 6 extra people during the winter.

(2) Refuges

	Three Brazilian Antarctic refuges can provide accommodation facilities for 6 scientists working for a period of 40 days in locations far from the "Comandante Ferraz" Antarctic Station. The "Astrônomo Cruls" Antarctic Refuge was established during the summer of 1984-85. It is located on Nelson Island, on geographical co-ordinates 62o 14',5 S and 058o 58',8W. The "Padre Rambo" Antarctic Refuge was built during the summer of 1984/85. It is located on Fields Peninsula, King George Island, on geographical co-ordinates 62o 09,9'S and 058o 57,9'W. The "Emilio Goeldi" Antarctic Refuge was constructed during the summer of 1988-89. It is located on Elephant Island, on geographical co-ordinates 61o 05’S and 055o 20'W.

3.3 Waste Management Plans

(1) Waste Treatment

All waste generated at the station is carefully sorted into four groups:

Group 1 – Sewage and domestic liquids
	The black water, after a primary  treatment, is directed to anaerobic filters, where it undergoes a secondary treatment. At the anaerobic filters the water is purified again, then it passes through filtration drains.
	The treatment system for grey water collects the wastewater from showers and directs them to a box that retains solid materials. From this box, the grey water passes through anaerobic filters and filtration drains that are not connected to the black water system. The black and grey waters final effluent is piped to the low tide line on the beach.
	The system has four septic cesspools, two anaerobic filters, two grease boxes and two intercepting boxes. To avoid the system and cesspool freezing, a thermal girdle was installed along the system and the septic cesspool. 


Group 2 – Liquid Chemicals and lubricants
	All lubricants and chemical liquid waste is stored and removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area by a support ship.

Group 3 – Combustible Solid Waste
	This group comprehends paper, wood, food, plastics and rubber (tires). Once a week, papers and food are burned in incinerators fitted with anti-pollutant filters. This process is continuously monitored for gas emission.  Wood, plastic and rubber are stored and removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area. 

Group 4 – Other solid waste
	Glass, aluminium, batteries, non-liquid chemical waste, empty drums, incinerator ashes and other solid belonging to this group, are compacted in a hydraulic press, stored and removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area.
