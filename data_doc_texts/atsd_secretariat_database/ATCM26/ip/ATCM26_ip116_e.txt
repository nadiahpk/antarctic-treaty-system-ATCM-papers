Summary Overview

IUCN, WCPA and WWF
High Seas Marine Protected Areas Workshop
15-17 January 2003, Malaga, Spain

SUMMARY OVERVIEW

The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) set a target date (2012) for the completion of an effectively managed, ecologically representative network of Marine and Coastal Protected Areas (MCPA) within and beyond areas of national jurisdiction, and the application of the ecosystem approach to the marine environment.

The establishment of a network of Marine Protected Areas beyond national jurisdiction (High Seas MPAs) represents a challenge and an opportunity to the international community. Such a network will require international co-operation at the global level as well as targeted efforts to address specific requirements, objectives and circumstances at the regional level. The IUCN, WCPA and WWF Malaga Workshop on HSMPAs identified the clear need to use and build upon existing legal regimes, in particular UNCLOS and the CBD, as well as the creation of new agreements to supplement this framework where necessary.  Any legal regime for HSMPAS, whether at the regional or global level, should have the effect of strengthening the linkages and co-operation between states and international institutions and facilitate conservation, enforcement and management of the high seas. 

The workshop concluded that urgent action was necessary to agree to draft and implement an international framework to protect biodiversity on the high seas that would be recognised by the international community as a whole.  The workshop concluded further that immediate action was essential to protect seamounts and other vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems and improve implementation of the existing legal framework for oceans governance.

In light of reported successes in the use of MPAs in coastal areas, taking MPAs beyond national jurisdiction would be a key mechanism for promoting sustainable resource management and conservation of biodiversity and productivity of the high seas.
Main Conclusions of the Malaga Meeting: 

The diverse group of internationally recognised experts in scientific, legal and institutional issues relevant to the conservation of high-seas biodiversity proposed three priority actions.

    • Networking: An essential first step is the establishment of expert networks among key international and intergovernmental organizations, governments, scientists, non-governmental organizations and the media to build support for high seas biodiversity conservation;
    • International Recognition of the Concept of High Seas Marine Protected Areas: Identification and use of opportunities to highlight the need for concerted action within the UN system, other international fora and the international community as a whole;
    • Designation of First High Seas Marine Protected Areas (HSMPAs): the establishment of one or more HSMPAs as “test cases,” to build experience with the practicalities of design, implementation and enforcement should be given urgent attention.  
To support the activities identified above, the experts suggested the development of the following tools and supporting research: 
Information, Networking and Awareness:

To facilitate information exchange and access, the experts recommended the establishment of an interactive website devoted to collecting and making available the most up to date scientific, management, policy and legal information. Other elements include focused research, policy analyses, broad-based consultations and engagement with key industry sectors. The UN Informal Consultative Process may also have a valuable role in developing this process.
Legal Support:

To facilitate the establishment of HSMPAs, the experts recommended a process that would include: review and policy analysis of relevant existing legal frameworks for high seas conservation and governance; recommendations to harmonize and coordinate existing international, regional and national laws and policies; identification of legal gaps and the necessary action to be taken to fill those gaps; identification of options for an overall legal framework for HSMPAs including the use of existing legal instruments and the development, where necessary of new regimes; and focused international consideration for options for seamount protection.
Technical and Scientific Support:

To support development of a technical basis for identification, selection and management of HSMPAs, the experts recommended that activities be undertaken to: urgently establish baseline studies of marine biodiversity in representative deep-sea ecosystems; draft assessment methods and criteria for determining the suitability of potential sites for designation as HSMPAs; develop draft guidelines for establishing HSMPAs; and develop a GIS database on potentially important biodiversity/productivity areas.
Public relations / promotion:

To enhance support for international co-operation to protect and sustainably use high seas biodiversity, the experts recommended programs for education, training and capacity building at the regional and national level, including assistance with the identification of potential areas that could be candidates for High Seas MPAs and development of policies to promote the use of MPAs in the context of ecosystem-based management. 

Examples of other aims or objectives for HSMPAs discussed:

In addition to the overall objective of conservation and sustainable use of high sea biodiversity and productivity through marine protected areas, the experts noted that marine protected areas could have other values, including protecting important long-term scientific study sites and protecting historic and archaeological sites pursuant to UNESCO Underwater Cultural Heritage Convention.
Areas for immediate urgent action while developing global network:

In light of the emerging and increasing threats to the high seas, the experts urged immediate action to manage and conserve vulnerable ecosystems as requested by the UN General Assembly in its 12 December 2002 Resolution on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, and to improve implementation of the legal framework for oceans governance.
