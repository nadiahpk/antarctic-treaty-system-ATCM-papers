    1. Background

Edmonson Point (74°20' S, 165°08' W) is located in Wood Bay, Victoria Land, Ross Sea, at the foot of the eastern slopes of Mount Melbourne, about 50 km NE of Terra Nova Bay Station (Italy) (Figure 1). Encompassing almost two km2, Edmonson Point is one of the largest of the few low-lying coastal ice-free areas in Northern Victoria Land. It was first identified in the 1980s as a site that could merit special protection (Keys et al., 1988).

Italy established a station at Terra Nova Bay in 1986-87 and increased research interest in the site followed. A variety of scientific projects have been initiated, many of which are long-term with international involvement.  For example, Edmonson Point was an important site for the SCAR Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) programme in 1995-96 in BIOTEX-1, which involved collaborative research among Australia, Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Bargagli et al., 1997). Terrestrial ecology studies are on-going (e.g. Frati, 1999; Cannone and Guglielmin, 2003).  There is important long-term research being conducted on bird colonies at Edmonson Point by Italy and Australia, which contributes to the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP) (e.g. Corsolini and Trémont, 1997; Olmastroni et al., 2000; Pezzo et al., 2001).  In addition, studies have been conducted on the geology, glacial geomorphology (e.g. Baroni and Orombelli, 1994), freshwater ecosystems (e.g. Broady, 1987; La Rocca et al., 1996), and on background contaminants (e.g. Bargagli et al., 1998; Corsolini et al., 2003).

On 15 April 2003 a small workshop was convened at the Dipartimento di Scienze Ambientali, Università di Siena, Italy, to bring together scientists from a variety of disciplines working at Edmonson Point to discuss proposals for a protected area.  Given the multi-disciplinary context, it was considered important to take the opportunity to discuss the reasons for special protection and to exchange views on management proposals, which have the potential to influence how science and support is carried out at the site.  

The workshop had three principal objectives:
    1. Review the latest scientific results from research being carried out at Edmonson Point;
    2. Appraise the values in need of special protection;
    3. Develop policies to regulate activities and to ensure the protection of values.

The first objective was accomplished through presentations made by Prof Roberto Bargagli (Terrestrial and freshwater ecology), Dr Nicoletta Cannone (Vegetation and permafrost), Prof Silvano Focardi (Seabirds and mammals), and Prof. Carlo Baroni (Geology and glacial geomorphology). The second objective was met by making a systematic evaluation using a ‘Values Appraisal Matrix’.  The third objective was achieved through workshop discussion of key management issues. 


    2. Summary of key values

The values at Edmonson Point were identified using a Values Appraisal Matrix, which was developed for practical application in the Siena workshop by C. Harris (Environmental Research & Assessment), and S. Grant (Scott Polar Research Institute), Cambridge, UK. The matrix (see Appendix) is based first on the broad values identified in Article 3.1 of Annex V of the Madrid Protocol.  The broad categories are broken down further according to examples provided in Article 3.2 of Annex V.  The matrix is also based on the ‘Guidelines for Protected Areas under Annex V’, which were developed by the working group established by the Committee for Environmental Protection (New Zealand, 2000), with some minor changes.

By appraising and describing any values present according to their essential quality attributes, it should be possible to define clearly those things about the area that are special or outstanding.  For example, is a particular ecosystem present at the site the best example of its kind, and if so in what context – regionally, Antarctic-wide, or globally? Or can it be considered particularly representative of an ecosystem in the region? Is the ecosystem especially diverse, unusual or unique? Is the ecosystem especially unspoiled or pristine, which may make it valuable for certain studies and important to maintain in this condition? Similar questions can be asked for the range of values in the matrix.

The Siena Workshop was one of the first attempts at practical application of a systematic values appraisal method at a potential protected area in Antarctica.  The Appendix presents the results of the appraisal, identifying values of importance at Edmonson Point.  The results to some extent reflect the expertise of specialists present at the Workshop, but nevertheless a wide range of important values was identified across many disciplines.  The most salient of these are:

    • The site is considered one of the best in Victoria Land for its diverse and extensive terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems;
    • The habitat for bryophyte development is one of the most extensive of its kind in Victoria Land, and vegetation is unusually well-developed;
    • The site is representative in the sense that a wide range of freshwater habitats is present, and is considered excellent for studies on biogeochemical processes in lakes;
    • This site is a good example of an Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) assemblage;
    • Scientific values are particularly high for terrestrial and freshwater ecology: the site is considered especially good for studies on the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems because of its geographical position; moreover, the unique properties of the active layer in the permafrost at the site make it useful as a sensitive indicator of possible changes;
    • The site also has high scientific value for the research being undertaken on Adélie penguins and south polar skuas, due to the practicality with which the methodologies being applied can be carried out and because a relatively long time-series of data has now been established;
    • Because of the diverse habitats and features, a wide range of science is conducted at the site, which makes it particularly good for multi-disciplinary research.

Other important values may also be identified by experts as the consultation process and plan development proceeds.


    3. Summary of key management issues

There are a range of important and potentially sensitive features at Edmonson Point, such as moist soils that are easily disturbed, an extensive but fragile vegetation cover, a variety of lakes and streams, and several species of breeding birds and seals.  The ice-free area itself is quite small (~2 km2), and the geography varies from steep, rocky hills to a flat, open coastal spit.  Options for the establishment of camps and facilities for the support of scientific activities need to take these constraints into account, and activities need to be coordinated so that risks and impacts can be minimised.

The Siena Workshop considered the principal issues and options in relation to management.  These included the aims and objectives of the proposed management plan, options for boundaries, mapping needs, helicopter access issues, the location and management of campsites and structures, and possible rules for the handling of materials and waste management.  A number of additional issues, such as management of the risk of introduced species, have been identified for further consideration.


    4. The proposed procedure for plan development

A full report from the workshop has been prepared, which includes the identification of values by scientists present (see Appendix), a record of the discussion of management policies, and suggestions on possible management options.  The report has been distributed to Workshop participants and is available on the web (see http://www.era.gs/projects/edmonson).  Further work on management options will be carried out over the coming year, and the advice and comments of CCAMLR will be sought on the draft management plan that is in preparation. While a decision on whether to propose inclusion of a near-shore marine component has yet to made, CCAMLR’s participation is seen as important because of the CEMP research being conducted at the site. 

Italy intends to submit a draft management plan to CCAMLR for consideration by its Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM) and the CEMP in 2003.  It is hoped that WG-EMM and other appropriate bodies of CCAMLR might be able to consider this draft plan and provide comments. Italy aims to complete a draft management plan for submission to CEP VII (2004), and hopes that it might be possible to do so with CCAMLR’s approval.

To this end, Italy would welcome the participation of all those with an interest in Edmonson Point in a consultative process to develop the draft plan over the coming year.

Environmental
Ecosystems
    • The site is one of the best in Victoria Land for its diverse and extensive terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.

    • The combination of species, in particular of Adélie penguin and South Polar skua populations is a good example of this type of ecosystem.
    • The site is representative in particular of an Adélie penguin and South Polar skua breeding area, with significant interaction between the two species.
    • The site is one of the best in Victoria land for its diverse and extensive terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.
    • The terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems at this site are diverse.
    • One of very few low-lying non-mountainous ice-free sites in Northern Victoria Land. While larger than most, the site is of very limited extent.
    • The seabird and seal ecosystem at this site is not considered particularly unique.
    • The diversity and combination of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems at this site is unusual.
    • The site is not considered especially pristine, having been worked at for more than 15 years.  However, contaminants in the local marine ecosystem are very low and human impacts on the ecosystem as a whole are not considered high.

Habitats
    • The habitat for bryophyte development is the most extensive of its kind in Victoria Land.
    • The site is representative in the sense that a wide range of freshwater habitats is present, although such habitat diversity is highly unusual in Victoria Land (see ‘Diverse’ & ‘Unique’).
    • Habitats for Adélie penguins, south polar skuas and Weddell seals are good examples and representative of those found elsewhere.
    • An exceptional diversity of freshwater habitats is present, with numerous streams, ponds and lakes, exhibiting eutrophic through to oligotrophic properties.
    • There is a particularly diverse range of breeding territory habitats for south polar skuas.
    • The range of habitats for Adélie penguins and Weddell seals is not particularly diverse, although perhaps no less diverse than other sites throughout Victoria Land.
    • The only site in N Victoria Land with such an extensive and substantial stream network.
    • The hydric environment present, influencing soil and  vegetation development, is rare in Victoria Land.
    • The South Polar skua population is thought to be unusual in Victoria Land due to the diversity of available habitats.
    • The habitats at this site are not considered to be pristine (see above), and there have been some impacts observed from human activity (e.g. footprints in moist soils, dispersal of materials from scientific equipment damaged by wind, construction of facilities, alteration of habitat by fence etc.). However, impacts are not all documented and some are not precisely known.

Species Assemblages
    • The bryophyte communities are the best example of their kind found in northern Victoria Land.

    • This site is a good example of an Adélie penguin and south polar skua assemblage. 

    • Assemblages of seabirds and seals are not particularly diverse at this site, although perhaps no less diverse than other sites throughout Victoria Land.
    • The site is unusual and rare because of the extensiveness of the terrestrial communities, in particular the bryophyte vegetation.
    • The unusually extensive and thick stands of moss are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrological regime, whether as a result of local or more global drivers.
    • There is an unusually high ratio of skuas to penguins (1:20) at this site.
?

Species

    • The site is particularly representative for algae species in Victoria Land, with over 120 species described [only 45 species in Bargagli earlier?]. 
    • The site is representative for both Adélie penguins and South Polar skuas.
    • An exceptional diversity of algal species exist as a consequence of the variety of freshwater habitats.
    • Invertebrates species present are not particularly diverse.
    • The range of seabird and seal species found is not particularly diverse.
    • The diversity of algal species found at one small site is rare in Victoria Land.
    • Invertebrates are unusually abundant and extensively distributed.
    • Seabird and seal species are not particularly unusual or unique at this site.
    • Regular monitoring programme has involved routine handling of individual birds (e.g. lavage, weighing, sampling, tracking), although numbers small cf size of colony.  Regular presence of people / constructions / access probably mean the colonies cannot be considered pristine, although the extent to which impacts have occurred is not well-known.

Geomorphological
    • The cuspate foreland in the north is one of the best examples of its kind in Victoria Land.

    • An exceptional diversity of geomorphic features is present, including a series of ice-cored moraines incorporating marine deposits, raised beaches, patterned ground, the cuspate foreland, fossil penguin colonies, etc.
    • 
    • The cuspate foreland in the north is an unusual feature in Victoria Land and one of only a few such features on this coast.
    • The foreland is unusual in that it is not occupied by a breeding colony of penguins, as is the case at C. Hallett and C. Adare.

Limnological
The site was considered to possess outstanding limnological values: specific aspects of limnological importance were appraised under other categories in the matrix.
Scientific
Existing/ On-going
    • The site is considered one of the best in Antarctica for studies of algal ecology because of the wide range of habitats present.
    • The site is considered one of the best in Antarctica for studies of the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems because of its geographical position in a continental research network (eg. the RiSCC programme) (see also “Unique”).

    • A wide representation of phenomena are under study, and the site is considered exceptionally good for multi-disciplinary studies.
    • The wide representation of terrestrial and freshwater habitats makes the site ideal for investigations of biological variation and processes along moisture and nutrient gradients.

    • An exceptional diversity of science is being carried out at the site, which reflects the diversity of habitats and features present, as well as relative accessibility from Terra Nova Bay Station.
    • There is a high diversity of scientific projects being carried out on seabirds at this site, which also adds value to science being undertaken in other disciplines (e.g. on nutrient gradients and on fossil penguin colonies).

    • Site is considered unusually sensitive as an indicator of terrestrial ecological change because of the unique properties of the active layer in the permafrost, which is particularly thick in this location.
    • The diversity of features / habitats support a diverse range of scientific projects in a variety of disciplines, which makes this site unusual for the region.

    • The science being conducted generally is not critically dependent on the environment being maintained in a pristine state, although human impact should be minimised to the greatest extent practicable.
    • Some ecotoxicological studies examining global background levels of contaminants in marine birds and vegetation have been carried out, which depend to some extent on the local area being relatively pristine.

    • The combination of moisture and nutrient gradients present at the site are particularly useful as analogues for possible future environmental change as a result of shifts in climate.
    • The lakes are among the best in N. Victoria Land for studies of biogeochemical processes which show short- and long-term variation: these features are considered particularly useful as a sensitive indicator of ecological change and climate-related effects.
    • This site is a very good location for the research presently being undertaken on Adélie penguins and South Polar skuas, due to the practicality with which these methodologies can be carried out.
    • The size of the colonies present, the terrain and habitat features of the site, and its proximity to Terra Nova Bay Station allow good access to the penguin and skua breeding areas.
    • The site is a CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) site, and research here is important to on-going investigations of how natural and human induced variations in the Antarctic ecosystem may affect the breeding success of Adélie penguins.
    • There is a wide range of phenomena under study for Adélie penguins and South Polar skuas (e.g. breeding success, foraging strategies, dive depth, migration, demography and behavioural studies)
    • Glacial moraines incorporating marine deposits are particularly useful for dating regional glacier fluctuations
    • Sedimentary sequences containing fossils from former penguin colonies are useful for dating the persistence of bird breeding at the site and thus for reconstruction of past glacial phases.


    • The effects of scientific research and human presence at this site are uncertain. There is no strong evidence for damage, but more time is required to discover possible reasons for penguin and skua population changes.

Planned
    • Extensive scientific databases have been built up at the site, which adds to its value for the conduct of future research.
    • Many long-term data sets are being established, which increases the value of the site for future scientific research.

    • Planned scientific research at this site is likely to reflect the diversity of current projects and the increasing interest in multi-disciplinary studies.

    • It may be important for future ecotoxicological studies, if they are planned, that local sources of contamination are minimised (e.g. for looking at trends in the global background).

Note:  “?” in the matrix indicates that the values are unknown, or the item requires further consideration.
