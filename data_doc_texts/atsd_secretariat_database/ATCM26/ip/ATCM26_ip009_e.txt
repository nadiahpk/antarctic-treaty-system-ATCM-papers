REPORT OF THE CCAMLR OBSERVER TO THE TWENTY SIXTH MEETING OF THE ATCM (aTCM-XXVI)
REPORT OF CCAMLR TO ATCM XXVI
    1. Introduction

1.1	In accordance with the regular overview of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) conducted under ATCM Recommendation XIII-2, CCAMLR is pleased to report on various developments since ATCM-XXV.

1.2	During its Twenty-First Meeting (  October to November 2002), the Commission for the Conservation Antarctic Marine Living Resources addressed a wide range of issues, most notably:

    • Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in the Convention Area;
    • Implementation of the Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp.;
    • Development of an electronic-based catch document system;
    • Possible CITES listing for Toothfish;
    • Development of an integrated fisheries management framework;
    • Development of an institutional Plan of Action to address Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing;
    • Management of the krill fishery in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, including the development of small-scale management units;
    • Development of ecosystem management,  including decision making;
    • Elimination of seabird by-catch in longline fisheries, and
    • Impact of marine debris.
    • 
1.3.	These issues are relevant to several items on the agendas of ATCM-25 and CEP-VI. 

2.	CCAMLR Membership

2.1	CCAMLR’s membership currently stands at 24 countries with an additional seven States being party to the Convention, but not Members of the Commission.


3.	Management of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
3.1	Fisheries in the CCAMLR Convention Area during 2001/02 mainly targeted Patagonian and Antarctic Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and krill (Euphausia superba).
3.2	The reported finfish catch was 15 473 tonnes in 2001/2002, compared to 16 284 tonnes in 2000/2001. Dissostichus spp. (Toothfish), predominantly from longlining, accounted for 12 817 tonnes in 2001/2002, compared to 13 725 tonnes in the previous season.  It is believed that, in addition to reported catches, some 10 898 tonnes of Dissostichus spp were taken as a result of illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in the Convention Area during 2001/2002, compared with 8 802 tonnes in 2000/2001. 
3.3.	The reported catch of krill in 2001/2002 was 118 705 tonnes, compared to 93 572 tonnes in the previous season.  The annual krill catch has remained relatively stable since 1992/93 ranging from 80 000 to 120 000 tonnes.
3.4	The Commission has adopted conservation measures for all fisheries being conducted in the 2002/03 season, as well as general measures for regulating fishing activities and reporting fisheries information from the Convention Area.  These are published annually the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force – 2002/2003.
3.4	The Commission continues to receive notifications from Member States intending to conduct new and exploratory fisheries. 
3.5	The Conservation Measures adopted at CCAMLR-XXI address all fisheries to be conducted in the Convention Area during the 2002/03 season. They also include general measures for regulating fishing activities and reporting fisheries information from the Area. In particular, five new Measures and two new Resolutions were adopted to promote compliance with CCAMLR Conservation Measures (by both Contracting and non-Contracting Parties) and to improve implementation of the Toothfish Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS).
3.6	The Conservation Measures and Resolutions for 2001/02 are published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force, 2001/02.
4. 	Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Fishing in the Convention Area
4.1	The IUU fishery for Toothfish (especially Patagonian Toothfish) in the Convention Area, as well as in closely adjacent areas, has been a major discussion item for CCAMLR for the past five years (1997–2002). The Commission considers information submitted by Members to evaluate IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area. This includes reports of sightings, and on apprehension, of IUU fishing vessels, factual data on sightings of vessels by scientific observers, port inspections of vessels and instances of fraudulent use of Toothfish catch documents under the CDS.
4.2	The revised estimates for IUU catch in the Convention Area in 2001/02 were 11 812 tonnes, compared with 8802 tonnes in 2000/01, 7 644 tonnes in 1999/00 and 5 868 tonnes in 1998/99. Catches of Patagonian Toothfish  continue to be reported via the CDS from areas adjacent to, and to the north of, the Convention Area. The level of reported catches from just outside the Convention Area in FAO Statistical Area 51 (Indian Ocean) may not be credible. In the light of this uncertainty, CCAMLR is faced with determining what proportion of the catches reported from Area 51 actually originate from that area, or are a product of IUU fishing inside the Convention Area.
4.3	Although there has been a noticeable reduction in IUU fishing in the Convention Area since 1996/97, CCAMLR continues to afford the matter high priority since it profoundly compromises the Convention’s primary objectives. In the light of information received in 2002, the Commission reinforced its integrated administrative and political measures aimed at eliminating IUU fishing in the Convention Area. Particular initiatives are outlined in the following paragraphs.

4.4	CCAMLR annually reviews its Members’ implementation of enforcement-related measures
4.5	To promote best fishing practices amongst its Members, CCAMLR has begun developing a Plan of Action to Combat IUU Fishing in the CCAMLR Convention Area (CPOA-IUU). The CPOA-IUU will incorporate all existing CCAMLR measures in force, as well as activities, to address IUU fishing. It will also identifies topics for future development. This initiative has taken place against a background of vigorous action by individual CCAMLR Contracting Parties to combat IUU fishing in areas under their national jurisdiction.  
4.6	In addition to the Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp. (see Section 5 below) and measures to manage specific fisheries directly (e.g. setting catch limits and other conditions affecting fishing), CCAMLR conservation and management measures include:

•	The CCAMLR System of Inspection:
•	Scheme to Promote Compliance by both Contracting and Non-Contracting Party Vessels;
•	Licensing and Inspection Obligations of Contracting Parties with regard to their Flag Vessels Operating in the Convention Area;
•	Procedures for port inspections of vessels carrying Toothfish;
•	Marking of Fishing Vessels and Fishing Gear; 
•	Automated Satellite-Linked Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS); and
•	Various Resolutions on – (a) “Banning Driftnet Fishing in the Convention Area”, (b) “Harvesting Species Occurring Both within and Outside the Convention Area”, (c) “Implementation of the CDS by Acceding States and  Non-Contracting Parties”, (d) “Use of Ports not Implementing the CDS”, (e) “Application of VMS in the CDS”, (f) “Use of VMS and Other Measures to Verify CDS Catch Data for Areas Outside the Convention Area, Especially FAO Statistical Area 51; (g) “Harvesting of D. eleginoides in Areas Outside Coastal State Jurisdiction Adjacent to the Convention Area in FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57, and (h) “Vessels Flying Flags of Non-Compliance”. 

4.7	Pursuant to Articles 19 to 23 of the 1995 United Nations Implementing Agreement for Highly Migratory Stocks and Straddling Stocks (UNFSA)(which entered into force in December 2001), the Commission maintains a vessel database to facilitate the exchange of information between CCAMLR Members on vessels known to have fished in contravention of CCAMLR Conservation Measures. It has also agreed to compile a list of non-compliant vessels and to develop a consistent procedure to identify thier flags.
4.8	CCAMLR continues to encourage Members to ratify, and promote the entry into force of, such international instruments as UNFSA, the 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. It has also noted the importance of the recent (February 2001) FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). The IPOA-IUU should constitute a useful tool in efforts to address IUU fishing in the Convention Area. The Commission has encouraged all its Members to participate in the IPOA-IUU to ensure development of a comprehensive, integrated and global approach to combat IUU fishing.
4.9	CCAMLR continues to request international and regional fisheries organisations, especially those with responsibility for waters adjacent to the Convention Area, to participate in the exchange of information on such issues as IUU fishing, as well as other matters relevant to CCAMLR (e.g. seabird by-catch).
5.	CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp.
	General
5.1	Adoption and implementation of the CDS (which became binding on CCAMLR Members on 7 May 2000) has been one of the most important steps taken by CCAMLR to address IUU fishing in the Convention Area.  The Scheme is designed to track Toothfish landings and trade flows from catches in the Convention Area and, where possible, adjacent waters.  The CDS’s main purpose is to identify the origin of Toothfish entering the markets of all Parties to the Scheme to help determine whether catches in the Convention Area have been taken in a manner consistent with CCAMLR’s Conservation Measures. As such, the CDS contains a number of trade related provisions. 
5.2	During 2002 the Commission continued the CDS’s development through:
•	A policy to enhance cooperation between CCAMLR and Non-Contracting Parties, including relevant measures;
•	Explanatory memoranda on implementation of the CDS; 
•	Initiation of a pilot scheme to develop an electronically-based CDS, and
•	Various other measures (again refer to relevant measures in paragraph 11).
5.3	Non-Contracting Parties implementing the CDS include the People’s Republic of China, Republic of Seychelles and the Republic of Singapore. The Republic of Mauritius has taken positive steps to prohibit landings in its ports of Toothfish without Catch Documents. Positive contacts continue with a number of other Non-Contracting Parties, most of which participate in Toothfish trade. 
5.4	On an on-going basis, CCAMLR promotes use of the CDS and provides information on its implementation to various intergovernmental and non-governmental fisheries, environmental and scientific organizations. These include: FAO, IOC, IWC, SCAR, SCOR, NAFO, ICCAT, FFA, CCSBT, SPC, I-ATTC, WTO, ASOC, IUCN and UNEP.
5.5	The CDS has attracted the attention of the World Trade Organization (WTO),	particularly its Committee on Trade and the Environment (CTE) and the FAO Committee on Fisheries. (COFI). CCAMLR fully endorses the development of uniform catch documentation and reporting measures which make use of appropriate technologies (as demonstrated by CCAMLR’s development of an electronic CDS noted 5.2 in above). CCAMLR has agreed to improve co-operation with the WTO and World Customs Organization (WCO), particularly the latter, in order to develop a harmonized customs code for Toothfish products.  
5.6	At CCAMLR-XXI, there was vigorous debate on a proposal to list Toothfish under CITES as a means to augment the CDS and to combat IUU fishing. The Commission unanimously concluded that:  
    • CCAMLR has primary competency for the conservation and rational use of Toothfish in the Convention Area;
    • The CCAMLR Scientific Committee is the pre-eminent scientific body with respect to the Toothfish biology, the species’ role in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and assessment of sustainable harvest levels;
    • CCAMLR will continue to enhance its measures to address IUU fishing;
    • The CDS is recognized as the appropriate documentation for Toothfish trade;
    • CCAMLR will continue to encourage adoption and use of the CDS by Non-CAMLR Members and, to this effect, would urge CITES parties to require a CCAMLR CDS document for all Toothfish imports; 
    • Further co-operation between CCAMLR and CITES would be welcome, and
    • CCAMLR welcomed CITES interest in the CDS and will invite the CITES Secretariat to send a representative to CCAMLR’s next meeting in late 2003.
Operation of the CDS
5.7	By January 2003, about 5600 Dissostichus Catch Documents (DCDs) had been issued by CCAMLR Flag States. Copies of these are produced and verified whenever a shipment of Toothfish is traded to allow all Contracting Parties (fishing or not fishing for Toothfish) to track such trade across their borders. 
5.8	Many CCAMLR Members have adopted the necessary legal and administrative instruments to give full effect to the CDS while others pursue these.
5.9	CDS information is processed and analysed to assess the volume and location of Toothfish trade. It also provides some indication of fish taken legally and provides a barrier to fish taken illegally entering the marketplace.
5.10	The system developed by the CCAMLR Secretariat to process, store and access CDS information takes into account the Scheme’s immediate objectives as well as its future potential for integration into a suite of related compliance and enforcement measures. Consequently, such information is available in close to real-time on the CCAMLR Website to allow CDS participants to assess the veracity of reported Toothfish landings. As already indicated, the initiation of an electronic-based CDS system clearly illustrates CCAMLR’s efforts to improve the Scheme’s effective implementation (see paragraph 17).
5.11	Application of the CDS has prevented a number of Toothfish landings and transshipments in the absence of valid DCDs, particularly through barring landings in the absence of a DCD as well as through the identification of fraudulent Documents.  There is also some evidence to indicate that introduction of the CDS has made trading in illegally-caught fish less profitable since such trade generally attracts much lower prices than fish accompanied by valid DCDs.. 
5.12	Finally, attention is again drawn to CCAMLR’s various resolutions which strive to improve the CDS’s broader application.
6.	Development of an Integrated Fisheries Management Framework
6.1	CCAMLR continues to pursue the development of an integrated fisheries management framework. Fishery Plans have been produced for a number of key fisheries in the Convention Area, particularly the krill, Toothfish and icefish fisheries.
6.2	CCAMLR has also revised the way in which it numbers and presents its Conservation Measures. The Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force - 2002/03 applies the new numbering system for the first time and also provides clear documentation of the history behind specific measures. 
7.	Ecosystem Management and Decision Making
7.1		The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP) collects long-term data from various Antarctic marine ecosystem components as well as the environment. Such data are used in analyses to provide an annual assessment of ecosystem status. Advice on long-term ecosystem trends and changes can then be incorporated into management advice. It is anticipated that the experience gained through the implementation of CEMP will provide a positive contribution to the CEP’s development of a State of the Antarctic Environment Report.
7.2.	The CCAMLR scientific community continues to explore ways in which ecosystem advice can be formally incorporated into management decisions. In this respect two key initiatives are currently under development. These include:
	(a)	A full review of CEMP in 2003 in order to ensure that its nature, along with the use of its data, remains appropriate in addressing the original objectives, namely:
	“To detect and record significant changes in critical components of the ecosystem to serve as a basis for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources by distinguishing changes due the harvesting of commercial species and changes due to environmental variability, both physical and biological”.
	(b)	On-going examination of applying small-scale management units as a means to approach and study relationships between krill, krill predators and the fishery.
8.	Seabird By-catch in Longline Fisheries
8.1	Over the past few years CCAMLR has taken a leading role in the creation and implementation of measures to reduce seabird mortality during longline fishing. Many of CCAMLR’s measures, particularly the provisions of Conservation Measure 25-02 (first adopted in 1992 as Conservation Measure 29), have been incorporated into the FAO International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds) adopted by COFI. A number of CCAMLR members have already developed and implemented national plans of action to address the seabird by catch issue.
8.2	Compliance with the provisions of CCAMLR Conservation Measure 25-02 has improved to such an extent that seabird by-catch levels in regulated fisheries in the Convention Area are now extremely low. However, there is still considerable concern surrounding the levels of such by-catch attributable to the IUU fishery and many of the important species breeding in the Convention Area (particularly albatrosses and petrels) remain affected by high levels of mortality associated with longline fishing on a global basis. To this extent, CCAMLR has urged its Members to support the entry into force of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) recently negotiated under the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). 
8.3	CCAMLR’s efforts to reduce seabird by-catch continue to require, or strive for:
    • Compulsory placement of international and scientific observes on board all vessels licensed to fish in the Convention Area;
    • Full compliance with mitigation measures set out in CCAMLR Conservation Measure 25-02, especially including suitable line weighting, and
    • Continuing development of underwater longline setting devices. 
8.4	CCAMLR exchanges information with various international fisheries and conservation organizations on the prevention of seabird incidental mortality during fishing operations, on the state of Antarctic seabird populations, incidental catches of seabirds in these fisheries, and on CCAMLR experience with mitigating techniques and the formulation of associated conservation action. In this respect emphasis is being given to high seas areas adjacent to the Convention Area and to species managed by CCAMLR. In the latter regard, CCAMLR has approached a number of other RFO’s (particularly those managing tuna, such as ICCAT, IOTC and CCSBT) in an effort to secure more global information on incidental by-catch of seabird species breeding in the Convention Area. It should be noted that many of these organizations do not mandate the collection of such data.

9.	Co-Operation with the Antarctic Treaty System & Other International Organizations

9.1	CCAMLR continues to subscribe to the view that links between CCAMLR and the ATCM, particularly in respect of the Madrid Protocol, constitute a unique system of environmental protection for the Antarctic as a whole.
9.2	In accordance with Article 6(2) of Annex V of the Protocol, no marine area can be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) or Specially Managed Area (ASMA) without CCAMLR’s approval. 

9.3	CCAMLR-XXI considered and approved management plans for four protected sites containing marine areas which had been submitted for consideration under the ASPA scheme.

9.4	CCAMLR continues to support its undertakings to: 

    •  Strengthen cooperation with the ATCM and CEP, especially on issues such as monitoring and protection of the environment, preparation of the State of the Antarctic Environment Report (SAER), protected species and areas, environmental pollution and other common responsibilities; 

    • Maintain contact with the ATCM Secretariat, once established, and provide it with assistance as required. The CCAMLR Secretariat has provided input in to, and shared its experience with, the process of setting up the Treaty Secretariat. In this connection, the CCAMLR Administration and Finance Officer took part the informal meeting held in early April 2003 to consider setting up the Treaty Secretariat;

    • Co-ordinate activities relevant to the Protocol’s implementation and, in particular, in respect of its Article 8. One of CCAMLR’s key concerns relates to the issue of whether a Party to the Protocol has a right to require activities by another Party falling within CCAMLR’s competence to be subject to an environmental impact assessment; and

    • Maintain CCAMLR’s distinct identity and responsibility in light of potential overlaps in competence between CCAMLR and the ATCM, especially taking into account that not all Members of CCAMLR are now parties to the Antarctic Treaty or Protocol.

9.5	Various tasks were identified for those Members representing CCAMLR at meetings of other international organizations in 2002/03 and a schedule of such attendance was drawn up.

10.	Future Work
10.1	CCAMLR-XXI reaffirmed that future work will focus on:

    • Enhancing the effectiveness of CCAMLR’s multilateral nature and expanding, if appropriate, current co-operation with conservation initiatives in areas adjacent to the Convention Area; 

    • Continuing close cooperation with other ATS instruments, as well as other agreements applicable to the Convention Area;

    • Developing a more extensive network of international contacts among fisheries and other relevant organizations;

    • Co-sponsoring a conference to be held in Queenstown, New Zealand in December 2003 to address issues relating to the governance on fisheries on the high seas,  and

    • Increasing efforts to preserve the Antarctic marine ecosystem, so as to contribute to ecological “health”, the sustainable use of marine living resources and, in particular, for the benefit of future generations.
