SUMMARY

Since 1992-93 season, the Antarctic Unit of the Tourism Board of Tierra del Fuego collects all information referring tourist operations to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia. During the 2002-03 season the survey program continued, showing the results obtained in the current report, which follows the same format as the previous ones. 

The data is collected according to the questionnaire approved by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Resolution 3 (1997), called Post Visit Report. 
Expedition Leaders of cruise ships involved during the Antarctic tourism season and Tour operator companies collaborate with this survey giving a copy of the above mentioned form after each voyage made. For this particular season, there is a 100% of response in the data obtained, due to the cooperation and commitment that Expeditions Leaders and supporting staff have among the Antarctic community.  

It is important to remember that all information collected for the current report only refers to those Antarctic voyages that called at the Port of Ushuaia, during 2002-03 summer season.

The following are main results obtained:
	The Antarctic ship-borne tourism season through the Port of Ushuaia started on November 8th ., 2002 with the departure of 'MS Nordnorge' to Antarctic waters and ended on March 22nd., 2003, with the arrival of ''MV Grigory Mikheev'. 

	19 cruise ships operated through the Port of Ushuaia. They made a total of 123 journeys, carrying 15,086 passengers.  

	51% of the journeys were ' local journeys'  (that started and ended in Ushuaia). 33% were 'semi-local' trips (that began or finished in Ushuaia). As same as the past season and showing a future growing trend on the operations, a 16% figure represents ' in transit' voyages  (journeys that call at Ushuaia in the middle of their cruise).

	In comparison with the previous season, the 2002-03 recorded 16 voyages more, a remarkable increase over the 1% showed previously (2000-01 vs 2001-02). Moreover, the number of passengers also increased in 2,200 passengers more (12,886 vs 15,086). These figures are related to the presence of large cruise ships during the analyzed Tourism season.   

	Regarding the number of passengers that visited Antarctica through other gateways, the Antarctic Unit estimated a world figure for Antarctic ship- borne passengers  of 15,454. It should be reminded that  15,086 of those called at the port of Ushuaia at least once.  

	As results, 97% of all visitors to the White Continent by cruise ship called at the  port of Ushuaia. The southernmost city remains as the most popular “Gateway To Antarctica”.

	The maximum capacity of the cruises ranged between 46 and 1200 passengers. The small ships (up to 100 passengers) made a total of 55 trips and carried 3,000 passengers. Medium ships (between 101 and 299 passengers) carried 5,449 passengers in 52 trips, and the large ones (more than 300 passengers) made 16 trips with 6,637 passengers.


    • The average of occupancy of cruise ship involved in this season varied from 45% to a maximum of 99%. The percentage is obtained considering maximum capacity of vessels and total passengers carried.

    • As regards nationalities, the majority of the Antarctic passengers recorded were  from United States of America, representing 47% of the total visitors to Antarctica through the Port of Ushuaia. 

TRANSIT of SHIPS and PASSENGERS through the PORT of USHUAIA

On November 8th., 2002, the Antarctic tourism ship-borne season started, with the departure of cruise ship 'MS Nordnorge' from the Port of Ushuaia to Antarctic waters. The season ended on March 22nd.,  2003, with the arrival of 'MV Grigiry Mikheev'.
During these months, 19 cruise ships called at the Port of Ushuaia, making a total of 123 voyages.

To analyze the flow of vessels and passengers which visited the Antarctic region using Ushuaia as a port of departure, transit and/or return, the journeys and consequently the passengers, have been classified into three categories:
    • LOCALS: Those journeys that started AND ended in Ushuaia. This means that passengers went through Ushuaia twice: when they embarked for departure and when they disembarked on return.  
    • SEMI-LOCALS: Those journeys that started OR ended in Ushuaia, alternating with another port. This means that passengers went through Ushuaia only once: on departure when they embarked, or on return when they disembarked.
    • IN TRANSIT: Those journeys that Neither started Nor ended in Ushuaia, but made a stopover at this port when going or coming from Antarctica. This means that passengers went through Ushuaia once, having started and ended the journey in other port(s). 
 Numbers for each category are shown in Table1.

From the total of journeys made through the Port of Ushuaia, there were 86 local trips, representing a 70% for those voyages that started and ended in Ushuaia. The semi-local  trips were 34, a 27.5 % figure to represent those journeys that started or ended at the local Port. As same as the last season,  3 in transit voyages were made during the 2002-03, recording a small proportion of 2.5% of all journeys made. 


Comparative analysis of ‘LOCAL’, ‘SEMI- LOCAL’ and  ‘IN TRANSIT’ JOURNEYS with previous seasons

   (*) The number of journeys is indicated in brackets.

On the table above it is shown that, on 2002-03 season the local journeys reached a 70%, showing again a  small decrease according to the previous season. 

Therefore, semi-local  voyages have increased, representing the 27.5% of the total amount of journeys. Once more, the in transit voyages were present during the analyzed season, with a consequently 2.5%.

It is noticeable the decreasing figure on 'local journeys' since 2000-01 season, meaning that Tour Operator companies are calling at other South American ports as well as the local harbor, remaining Ushuaia as the main operating port for Antarctic Tourism so far.  

It is interesting to observe the presence of 'in transit journeys' during the last two seasons. Although the figure represents a small number of trips made to Antarctica involving Ushuaia as the main port of call, it should be consider a possible future trend for Antarctic ship-borne tourism, as a consequence of the operation of large cruise ships. 


COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS of SEA-BORNE ANTARCTIC  TOURISM going through USHUAIA with WORLD FIGURES
   
According to preliminary information provided by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), the Antarctic Unit of The Tourism Board of Tierra del Fuego estimated a total of 15,454 Antarctic ship-borne world passengers sailing from different ports to Antarctica. From this total number of passengers, 15,086 went through the local port at least once. This means that  97 % of the passengers called at the Port of Ushuaia to visit Antarctica by sea at least once during their journeys.

It should be noted that, as same as last year's report, no landing voyage passengers have been considered to obtain the total number of  passengers that traveled through Ushuaia to Antarctica. It means that passengers from both sea-borne traditional cruises with landings and no landing (large ships) cruises have been calculated.     

 Table 3 shows the flow of Antarctic tourists going through Ushuaia compared with the world wide total of passengers that visited Antarctica by sea. 

The column “Ushuaia passengers” section is divided into ‘Total’ (number of tourist who went through Ushuaia at least once) and ‘Local’ (those who started and ended their journeys at Ushuaia). For both cases, the corresponding percentages against world figures are shown.

The 19 Antarctic cruise ships that operated through Ushuaia during 2002-03, were under the following countries flag: 6 were from Russia, 6 from Bahamas, 2 from  the Netherlands, 1 from Liberia, 1 from Barbados, 1 from Norway, 1 from United Kingdom and 1 from Panama. 

Regarding the ship classification mentioned above, 7 of the ships are small ships, 7 of remaining ones are medium and the other  5 are large ships category.

The maximum capacity of the vessels ranged between 46 and 1200 passengers. The small ships (up to 100 passengers) made 55 trips carrying 3,000 passengers, the medium ships (between 101 and 299 passengers) carried 5,449 passengers in 52 trips, and the large ships (more than 300 passengers) made 16 trips with 6,637 passengers.

The percentage of average occupancy of the vessels ranged from  45% to 99%. 
The small ships prove to have a higher occupancy average in comparison with the other two categories. 
 
The average duration of the journeys varied between 12 to 21 nights onboard. However,  in most of the cruises, 12 days journeys were the ordinary. On Table 4  it is noticeable the difference between the particularly extended voyages made by the three larger cruise ships ('MS Crystal Symphony', 'MS Ryndam' and 'MS Amsterdam') versus a likely trend of 12-13 days extension for Antarctic journeys. 

These large ships mentioned above organized special itineraries including visits to the Antarctic Peninsula within its South American cruising season. It is important to mention that these cruise ships made no landings in the Antarctic Treaty area.

NATIONALITY of ANTARCTIC PASSENGERS

The Post Visit Report provides data concerning the various nationalities of Antarctic passengers that traveled through Ushuaia during the 2002-03 season.

In the following list, it is displayed the main nationalities for Antarctic travelers, with the correspond figure and percentage:
⇒ United States of America:		7,076 passengers		47%	 
	⇒ Germany:				1,951 passengers		13%
	⇒ United Kingdom			1,768 passengers		12%
	⇒ Australia				   846 passengers		  6%
	⇒ Canada				   645 passengers		  4%
	⇒ Japan				   454 passengers		  3%
	⇒ Netherlands			   358 passengers		  2%
	⇒ Rest of the World			1,988 passengers		13%
 

Pie graph 1 shows that by far, the majority of the travelers were North American, followed in decreasing proportion by passengers from Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Netherlands and Japan.
