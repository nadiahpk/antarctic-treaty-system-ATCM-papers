Establishment of a Website for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat 
























Submitted by Argentina 

ESTABLISHMENT OF A WEBSITE FOR THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT

One of the main purposes of the Secretariat is to provide support to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and the Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP), to enable them to operate with greater efficiency and effectiveness.  

To facilitate the prompt and efficient establishment of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat the Republic of Argentina has taken a number of initiatives. These include the provision of a headquarters building which has the capacity to accommodate  personnel, computing support, and the development of a website for the Secretariat.

Recognising that use of the world-wide-web will increase the efficiency with which the Secretariat performs many of the functions, Argentina has prepared a developmental website for the Secretariat’s use.  This web-site will assist the Secretariat in undertaking the following functions:
    • Collate information for ATCM and CEP meetings
    • Distribute meeting agendas and reports
    • Distribute meeting documents
    • Support inter-sessional consultations
    • Facilitate and co-ordinate the exchange of information
    • Publish databases relevant to the operation of the Antarctic Treaty
    • Circulate relevant information amongst Parties and disseminate information on activities in Antarctica
    • Publish, as appropriate, the records of ATCMs. 

A draft site map of the website is provided at Attachment A. 

Two types of information are included on the website: information only available to Antarctic Treaty Parties, and information that is also available to the public.  Information that is only available to ATPs is password protected. 

It is proposed that the information accessible to the public should include: Document Archive (the Antarctic Treaty; the Madrid Protocol; the reports of all past ATCMs and Special ATCMs; ATCM Measures, Decisions, Resolutions and Recommendations); Antarctic Treaty exchange of information (At this moment running as a different WEB site – www.infoantarctica.org.ar- ); a complete list of forthcoming and past meetings, and access to meeting documents from past ATCMs and Special ATCMs; a list of Antarctic Treaty Signatory Parties and a list of representatives with contact details. The site would also provide on-line access to the current Antarctic Treaty Handbook and provide links to other Antarctic related sites, such as SCAR, COMNAP, CCAMLR, and national Antarctic programs. 

The members’ area is designed to provide information and services to the Treaty Parties. Information included in the members’ only area would include meeting documents for forthcoming ATCM and CEP meetings, information on Treaty inspections and the ability to view and change the list of Parties’ representatives. 

The website can be accessed at http://www.ats.org.ar in its English version.

Argentina would appreciate Parties’ comments on the website.  Comments should be emailed to Lic. Jose Luis Agraz at jagraz@dna.gov.ar.
