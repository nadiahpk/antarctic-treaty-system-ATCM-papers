IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism

Submitted by the
International Association Of 
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) 
2002-2003 Antarctic Season


The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2002-2003 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. Additional information can be found on line at www.iaato.org, including the statistics compiled annually by the Office of Polar Programs at the United States National Science Foundation.

1.0	Overview

IAATO Member Activities
    • 180 tourists participated in land-based expeditions 
    • 10,271 tourists traveled aboard commercially organized IAATO member vessels and landed in the Antarctic Peninsula.
    • 321 tourists traveled aboard commercially organized IAATO member vessels and landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica.
    • 2,424 tourists traveled on board IAATO-member large cruise vessels and did not land in Antarctica-cruise only.
    • All IAATO member-operators have submitted Initial Environmental Impact Assessments (Environmental Impact Assessments-EIA’s) to their appropriate national authority.

Non IAATO Member Activities
    • Approximately 2,799 tourists traveled aboard non-member vessels or aircraft and landed tourists in the Antarctic Peninsula.
    • Approximately 1552 tourists have participated in overflights from either Australia or South America to Antarctica.
    • Government supported tourism activities and figures have not been provided to IAATO departing from South Africa and South America.
    • Private and some commercial activities where Advance Notification and Post Visit Site reports have been filed through their national authority have not been forwarded to IAATO to be included in this report.

Tourist activities included small boat or zodiac cruising, shore landings, and to a lesser extent kayaking, mountain climbing, scuba diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, marathon running, helicopter and Argo operations. All of these activities have taken place for a minimum of 3 years and or dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the 1960’s. A brief summary of the season, "IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism, 2002-2003,” is appended (Appendix A) and a Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism, 2003-2004 is appended (Appendix B) which further details the companies, vessels and numbers.

Based on information returned to IAATO and US-NSF in annual reports or in the Post Visit Site reports during 2002-2003, it is estimated that 13,571 tourists landed in the Antarctic on private sector sea borne and land based expeditions.

Nearly all-commercial tour companies during the 2002-2003 season were located in Contracting Party States.

2.0	Seaborne Tourism

2.1	13,263 tourists landed in the Antarctic on 26 commercially organized tour vessels plus numerous sailing vessels and or yachts from November 2002 to March 2003, representing a 16% increase over the 2001-2002-season total of 11,423 ship-based visitors.  For the last three years (2001-2002 and 2002-2003) sea borne tourism with landings have continued to decrease since the millennium peak of 1999-2000. However this number is expected to increase in 2003-2004.

	IAATO members operated all but three of the Antarctic tour vessels that sailed in 2002 – 2003. One non-IAATO vessel (USA based operator) has been operating in Antarctica since 1993. (IAATO’s Bylaws state that vessels carrying more than 500 passengers cannot land and that stringent landing restrictions could be placed on vessels over 200 passengers at specific landing sites if necessary due to environmental considerations.) This vessel carries and lands more than 500 passengers.)   The other two non-IAATO vessels are much smaller, with passenger capacities of 40 and 24 (Netherlands based operator). All three vessels submitted Post Visit Site reports and were listed on the IAATO vessel call data and overall ship schedules.

2.2	The vast majority of Antarctic voyages sail to the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month Austral summer season (November – March), departing from Ushuaia, or, to a lesser extent, from Port Stanley, Punta Arenas, Valparaiso, Puerto Madryn, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro. Of approximately 136 ship and yacht voyages during the 2002-2003 season, 130 voyages visited the Antarctic Peninsula region; 6 visited the Ross Sea/Continental area.  A breakdown of the tourist activities follows.

2.3	Region visited	Activity	Number of 	Number of 
			Voyages	Persons
Peninsula only	landings	127	12,675	
Peninsula only	no landing 	3	2,424
Peninsula/sailing vessels	landings	Not Available	157 (approximately)
Ross Sea/Continental	landings  	6	321   
Land based/Interior	land based	Not relevant	180

*This is an estimate based on incomplete information from sailing vessel/yacht operators
*One vessel completed the 2nd Full Circumnavigation of Antarctica. The trip has been included however in the above list.

The three large cruise vessels-cruise only carrying over 500 tourists visited Antarctica once each for a 72-hour time period each time and carried 2,424 tourists to the Antarctic Peninsula

3.0	Commercial Antarctic Sailing Vessels and or Yachts (non-IAATO members)

	Based on information received by the IAATO Secretariat, a total of 157 passengers were reported to have traveled to Antarctica aboard 21 or more non-IAATO commercial sailing vessels and or yachts in the 2002-2003 season. This information is compiled at Arthur Harbor by U.S. National Science Foundation staff, and by information provided by the British Antarctic Survey personnel at Port Lockroy.

3.1	Commercial sailing vessels with fare paying passengers include the Pelagic (IAATO Member, Pelagic Expeditions) and Golden Fleece (IAATO member Golden Fleece Expeditions). Others (non-IAATO members) are listed in the table “Overview of Non-IAATO Member Yachts, 2002-03.”  The IAATO Secretariat is in correspondence with several of the non-member sailing vessels. Antarctic Treaty parties permitting sailing vessel/yacht operations should encourage the use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO would like to request copies whenever possible of all Post Visit Site reports for non-member companies so that tourism data can be compiled on landing sites and overall numbers. This will also further assist in being able to compile data for use in furthering the understanding of potential cumulative impacts. This request was also made to ATCM XXV.

3.2	IAATO has compiled a complete list of companies that operated during the 2002-2003 season so that national programs that are overseeing sailing vessel-yacht activities from their respective countries assure that the Environmental Protocol requirements have been met. 

3.3	Activities Conducted from Expedition Cruise Vessels

3.3.1	Extended Kayak Trips 
One ship operator transported a specialty ecotourism and adventure company to the peninsula. There were 10 tourists accompanied by two guides. The group was dropped off by the ship at Enterprise Island (two nights), Cape Anna (one night), and Danco Island (one night).
Campsites were chosen so as to avoid concentrations of wildlife and were located at least 200 meters from any bird-nesting site. Campsites were on snow or bare rock, away from any small lakes or moss/lichen beds, in order to avoid contamination of water or damage to flora. The IEE was filed via the ship operator and approved by a Contracting Party.

This is the third extended kayak trip in 3 years. Different groups have conducted all trips. There were two expeditions in 2001-2002 and the above-mentioned trip in 2002-2003 seasons. All three trips had different routes.

3.3.2	Camping from Ships in the Peninsula
Three different companies currently offer camping. It provides an excellent opportunity for tourists to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica-separate from being on the ship. This activity has taken place for at least 8 years in the Peninsula region. Campsites are generally located at least 200 meters from penguin or other nesting birds. Camping is on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites. Each campsite is used for no more than a few nights per season. Camping has proved to have a less than minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. Toilets are generally taken ashore, human waste returned to the ship and meals are eaten on board ship only.

3.3.3	Climbing and Kayaking from Ships in the Peninsula
Climbing and kayaking has proven to be successful activities for over 7 years in the Antarctic Peninsula.

3.3.4	Scuba Diving
Scuba Diving has been offered on some vessels for 5years. During the 2002-2003 season 3 companies offered scuba diving. Only one accident/death has occurred (2002-2003 season). Diving has been a great success with little environmental impact. 

3.3.5	Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) has been used by one company for at least 2 years. The ROV is used for educational purposes. Video footage is taken by the ROV and aired on board ship for tourists to be able to experience first hand the “underwater” life. 

4.0	Land-based Tourism

4.1 	IAATO member Adventure Network International (ANI) operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the sixteenth consecutive season. ANI carried a total of 180 land-based tourists, which included support services for private expeditions, and ANI-organized and operated expeditions.  ANI also continues to provide Emergency Medical Evacuation Response (EMER) to IAATO member vessels throughout the period that the tourist vessels are operating in the Peninsula region. ANI’s operations include the following:

	ANI Aircraft Operations  
    • One Ilyushin-76 for cargo and fuel and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills for a total of 15 flights.
    • One Twin Otter aircraft, ski equipped, was used for interior flights through the end of the Antarctic season. 
    • One Cessna 185 on skis was also used for interior flying.
    • One Single Otter on skis was used for interior flying.

		Patriot Hills Camp opened 17 October 2002 and closed 18 February 2003. 

ANI provided support for the following private expeditions: 
    • Ice Bike
    • Brian Cunningham
    • Rodrigo Jordan
    • NHK TV

4.2 	Land Based Non IAATO Member DAP Activities

In 2002-2003, there were 23 flights by Aerovias DAP in a 10-passenger-capacity aircraft totaling 128 passengers. DAP offered an overflight and landing at King George Island. The tourists accompanied by a guide visit the Chilean, Russian, Chinese stations, Villa las Estrellas (Chilean Settlement) and surrounding wildlife areas.

*Note as of the 2003-2004 season DAP will become an IAATO member.

5.0	Overflights: Non IAATO Member-Air Operations-Flight Seeing and or Landing

5.1	During the 2002-2003 season, Non-IAATO Member Croydon Travel of Victoria Australia operated three Antarctica day sightseeing flights from Australia aboard a Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the 8th consecutive season.

A total of 1,072 tourists participated in three flights. In addition, the aircraft carried a total of 132 crew during the season. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 67 flights carrying nearly 23,000 tourists since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The aircraft operate at a minimum altitude of 10,000 ft or 2,000 ft above the highest ground within 100 nautical miles. The flights operate mainly to the northern Victoria Land coast, Oates, George V and Adélie Land regions. The pilots avoid any known penguin colonies by a horizontal separation of one mile and provide a full in-flight lecture and education program utilising at least three Antarctic lecturers and at least six videos.

A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground to air interviews
are conducted with staff members at Australian and sometimes Italian bases. 

Croydon Travel expects to operate at least four flights during the 2003-2004 season to the same areas detailed from Melbourne, Sydney and Perth in addition there will be an eclipse flight to Wilkes Land. 

5.2	Numerous flights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate from Punta Arenas, Chile but information on these flights prior to 2002-2003 had been difficult to obtain.  Overflights to the Antarctic Peninsula from Punta Arenas, Chile, operate frequently from November to March, by two companies, Lan Chile and Aerovias DAP. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers and independent travelers calling at Punta Arenas.  

Twelve flights by Lan Chile in a 60-passenger capacity Boeing 737-200, totaling 480 passengers were offered during the 2002-2003 season. *Note as of the 2003-2004 season, Lan Chile will become a member of IAATO.

The flying routes vary according to weather conditions but basically are as follows:
    • King George Island, Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and 
Deception Island (South Shetland Islands).
    • King George Island and Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell Sea in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands.

6.0	Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2003-2004 Season
	
Appendix B illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that will occur during the 2003-2004 season. This is an estimate based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat. Note that most all the activities listed have occurred in the past 12 years but have not necessarily been presented in such detail. IAATO is attempting to present as much factual information as possible in order to clarify activities that have occurred, and are planned for the future. 

Seaborne or Ship Based tourism will include: zodiac operations, Argos Operations, landing, camping, kayaking, scuba diving, climbing, and use of underwater ROV.

6.1	According to estimates provided to IAATO by tour operators, approximately 20, 818 seaborne, sailing vessel may land in Antarctica on commercially organized tour vessels and approximately 530 on land-based expeditions during the 2003-2004 season.  These figures represent increases in all categories from the 2002-2003 season. There will be four visits by two IAATO-member large vessels visiting the Antarctic Peninsula during the 2003-04 season.  
	
	Non Member activities are concerning to IAATO.  At least two of the 500+passenger vessels will land tourists in Antarctica during 8 departures. 

        6.2 DAP is planning on flying tourists from Punta Arenas, Chile, to King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at Marsh Base. In addition there is a Fly/Cruise Program which includes a flight from Punta Arenas to Marsh. Tourists will embark and sail and make landings in the Antarctic Peninsula for 5 days.

        6.3 There are proposed government sponsored tourist operations for the 2003-04 season intending to operate from Cape Town, South Africa, to Dronning Maud Land.  Updated details on environmental impact assessment, and types of activities have not been provided to IAATO.

        6.4 Some national program vessels carry tourists. National Programs should report their tourist numbers and activities if they are landing at typical tourist sites so we can account for the “footprint” and address cumulative impact issues.

        6.5 Some national programs are supporting and or transporting adventure travelers-climbers, skiers etc and should report their tourist activities.

7.0	Antarctic Tourism Trends

7.1	For the past 14 years, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has compiled and distributed detailed information on Antarctic tourist activities. IAATO collaborates with NSF to ensure that all Antarctic tourism is represented, not just that of U.S. organizers. Appendices include the following tables and charts compiled by NSF and IAATO to reflect the 2002-2003 season. This data is an invaluable resource, showing tourism activity at individual landing sites over time. 

7.2	The following data sheets will be placed on the IAATO website under the category of “Tourism Statistics.” (1) Continental Sites, Ranking in the Top 5 Most Visited Sites for the Last 11 seasons (1992-2003 ), (2) Summary of Continental Sites Visited by Tour Ships, 2002-2003,  (3) Overview of Continental Sites Visited over 11 seasons, (4)Fourteen  Season Overview of Sites Visited in the Antarctic Peninsula, (1989-2002 ), (5) 2002-2003 Summary of Peninsula Sites Visited by Tour Ships, (6) Peninsula Sites Ranking in the Top 5 Most Visited Sites for the last 14 Seasons (7) 2002-2003 Tourists by Nationality, (8) 2002-2003  Nationalities of Seaborne and Land-Based Antarctic Tourists, (9) Comparison of Nationalities 1994-2003, (10) Projected Trends in Antarctic Tourism, (11) 1992-2003  Antarctic Tourist Trends, (12) Summary of Seaborne and Land-Based Antarctic Tourism by Departures 2002–2003.

7.3	During the 2002-2003 season the following 11 Peninsula sites were the most highly visited by tourists, crew and staff. Total numbers of people are in brackets. Remaining statistics can be found on the IAATO website. These are based from vessel staff that has completed Post Visit Site Reports.

    • Whalers Bay (8,934) 
    • Port Lockroy Goudier Island (6,928)
    • Jougla Point (6,575)
    • Almirante Brown Station, Paradise Bay (6,556)
    • Petermann Island (6,311)
    • Neko Harbour (5,827)
    • Half Moon Island (5,413)
    • Cuverville Island (4,749)
    • Hannah Point (4,096)
    • Aitcho (3,566)
    • Waterboat Point (2,920)

        7.4 During the 2002-2003 season the following 7 Continental sites were ranked as the most highly visited by tourists, expedition staff and crew. Total numbers of people are in brackets. Note that numbers of tourists landing in the Ross Sea decreased during this season due to heavy ice conditions and also one vessel undertaking the Full Circumnavigation of Antarctica

    • Cape Royds-Ross Island (235)
    • Cape Evans-Ross Island (228)
    • Taylor Valley-Dry Valleys (177)
    • Cape Hallett (84)
    • Terra Nova Bay Station (78)
    • McMurdo Station (74)
    • Cape Adare (55)

*Note the above numbers are inclusive of all expedition staff, crew and passengers. In order to measure long-term cumulative impact it is necessary to look at the total number of people who landed at each site and not just tourists.

7.5	IAATO currently predicts that Antarctic tourism will continue to grow if, as expected, large ships include Antarctica in itineraries such as “Round the World,” or “Round South America” etc. Currently there are approximately 20 large ships visiting South America that could add Antarctica into their cruise itineraries. The increase in numbers reflects the numbers carried by large vessels but not necessarily the number of tourists that might land in Antarctica or for how long the tourists would land. IAATO will continue to monitor developments in the tourism industry. Tourism in the Ross Sea Region has declined over the last several years. There should be a slight increase during the 2003-2004 season.

8.0	Conclusion
In practice and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether or not associated with IAATO – are included in emergency contact information, exchange of information, scheduling etc. Government and National Program representatives and prospective members are encouraged to participate in the annual general meeting where IAATO Bylaws, operating procedures, obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System and policies are developed. However as the organization has grown IAATO does require assistance and support from the Antarctic Treaty System. 

IAATO member tourist activities continue to have a less than minor and transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. IAATO as an organization is focused on minimizing impacts and consequently evaluate all relevant tourist activities in this document. 

IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent. Not all tourist activities are being reported by parties that are receiving Advance Notification and Post Visit Site Reports.

Overall the tour operators had a very successful season

*Note prior to the 2002-2003 seasons there were discrepancies in reporting by Expedition Leaders, which is why Port Lockroy and Goudier are both, listed. From 1989 until 1996 often the Expedition Leaders would put Port Lockroy but the landing could have been at either Goudier or Jougla. The mix up in reporting has now been cleared up amongst IAATO members.

*Note 90-91 =Gonzales Videla was top site w/ 1,965
