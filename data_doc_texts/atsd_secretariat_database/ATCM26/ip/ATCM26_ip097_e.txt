This report has been prepared in compliance with article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

    1. NOTIFICATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 17 OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
        1.1 Notification of the measures taken pursuant to Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Protocol

The Madrid Protocol has been ratified by the Belgian regional parliaments in 1994/1995. The federal parliament has approved this ratification by its law of May 19, 1995.

Draft legislation to transpose the measures of the Madrid protocol into Belgian law was submitted for approval to Belgian Parliament at the beginning of 2003.  Unfortunately the document did not pass the Parliament before the end of the past legislature. It is the intention that the matter will be taken up again by the new government and the newly elected Parliament in the course of the year 2003.

In order to further its role in marine living resources conservation and management at international level, Belgium has taken steps to become full member of the International Whaling Commission in 2004, provided Parliament's assent. This month of June, a Belgian observer is already taking part to the Commission's annual meeting in Berlin.
