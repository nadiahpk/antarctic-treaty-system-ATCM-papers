Annual Report of New Zealand Pursuant to Article 17 of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty



Information Paper
New Zealand



    1. Notification of measures taken pursuant to Article 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Environmental Protocol

No new legislation has been enacted in New Zealand to implement the Protocol since the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 was enacted on 1 November 1994.  Since that time New Zealand has worked to fully implement the Protocol, including into the activities of the national Antarctic programme managed by the New Zealand Antarctic Institute (Antarctica New Zealand).  

A list of approvals and permits issued under the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 during the 2002/03 season is attached as Annex I.


    2. Contingency Plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol

Antarctica New Zealand has in place the following contingency plans to cover its activities in Antarctica:

    • Environmental Management System
    • Oil Spill Contingency Plan
    • Disaster Recovery Plan

Information regarding these plans can be obtained from:

3.	Report Pursuant to Annex I, Article 6 (1) of the Protocol 

3.1	Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures 

The Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 implements the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  Under the Act, all activities must undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as set out in Part III of the Act (ss17-24).  Under section 24 of the Act, it is an offence to carry out an activity without completing this process.  

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) administers this Act and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes the final determination as to whether or not an activity should proceed.  EIAs are submitted to the Antarctic Policy Unit of MFAT, which then refers the EIAs for all activities to the Environmental Assessment and Review Panel (EARP).  The EARP is an informal body which provides expert advice to MFAT on the potential environmental impacts of the proposed activities.    

Antarctica New Zealand coordinates the provision of EIAs for any activities it supports.  The preparation of other EIAs is the responsibility of the proponent, although MFAT can provide a model IEE on request, as well as advice and guidance on the type and content of the EIA that is needed.  

Final approval on the EIA is given by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the basis of MFAT recommendations which take into account the advice of EARP.  The Minister also has discretion under the Act to set conditions and make directions regarding the proposed activities, in order to protect the environment. Conditions and directions are often imposed to manage issues such as compliance and environmental monitoring and post-activity reporting. Non-compliance with a direction given by the Minister is an offence carrying liability to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding $100,000 (s 10(2) and (3)).

        3.2 List of Initial Environmental Evaluations 
 
A list of Initial Environmental Evaluations for the 2002/2003 season prepared in accordance with Annex I, Article 2 of the Protocol is included in Annex 1. 

        3.3 Significant information obtained, and any action taken in consequence thereof, from procedures put in place in accordance with Annex I Articles 2(2) and 5 of the Protocol 
  
During the 2002/2003 season, no significant information has been obtained from monitoring procedures put in place in accordance with the provisions of Annex I.

        3.4 Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (Annex 1, Article 3 (6)) 

Antarctica New Zealand prepared a draft CEE for ANDRILL: The McMurdo Sound Portfolio, a proposed scientific stratigraphic drilling programme, which was circulated to Parties in early 2003.


4.	Report pursuant to Annex II, Article 6 of the Protocol

        4.1 Number and nature of permits issued under Annex II of the Protocol during the 2002/2003 season

Permits issued under Annex II for the 2002/2003 season are noted in the table in Annex I.

        4.2 Records and statistics concerning flora and fauna taken in the 2002/2003 season

5.	Report pursuant to Annex III, Article 9 of the Protocol

Antarctica New Zealand’s overall policy statement on waste management is:

“Antarctica New Zealand will minimise, reuse and recycle waste generated by its activities as far as practicable and will ensure that waste is disposed of with minimal environmental impacts.  Waste management planning will examine the use, where appropriate, of alternative technologies, materials and disposal options, and identify areas of past activity which require future clean up and/or remediation.”

Antarctica New Zealand has a more detailed waste management policy which sets out the requirements for waste handling, storage and disposal.  Antarctica New Zealand also has a waste management handbook that provides national programme personnel with practical procedures for the day-to-day implementation of the waste management policy.  The handbook is reviewed every year at the close of the summer season and aids planning of Antarctica New Zealand waste management activities.

The waste management policy and handbook, reports on their implementation and inventories of past activities can be obtained from:

6.	Report pursuant to Annex IV of the Protocol

6.1	 Notice of activities undertaken in case of emergency (Article 7 (2))  

There have been no cases of emergency relating to the safety of a ship and those on board or saving life at sea involving New Zealand flagged vessels in the 2002/2003 season.

        6.2 Implementation of Sovereign Immunity (Art 11 (2))

New Zealand state owned and operated vessels are subject to the Marine Protection Rules applicable to Antarctica issued under the Maritime Transport Act 1994.  These rules implement both MARPOL 73/78 and Annex IV of the Protocol.  


7.	Report pursuant to Annex V, Article 10 of the Protocol

7.1	Number and nature of permits issued under Annex V of the Protocol during the 2002/2003 Season
 
Permits issued under Annex V for the 2002/2003 season are noted in the table in Annex I.

7.2	Significant Change or Damage to any ASMA, ASPA or Historic Site or Monument 

There has been a change to Historic Site No. 67, as the Antarctic Heritage Trust has removed the remains of a historic sledge from the site for conservation purposes.

7.3	Measures taken to implement the provisions of Annex V 

Site inspections were conducted at Cape Evans ASPA 155 and Canada Glacier ASPA
131, as part of the five year review of their management plans. Five-year reviews were also undertaken for Lewis Bay ASPA 156, Botany Bay ASPA 154 and Beaufort Island ASPA 105 management plans (see New Zealand Working Paper Review of Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Nos. 105, 131, 154, 155, and 156).
