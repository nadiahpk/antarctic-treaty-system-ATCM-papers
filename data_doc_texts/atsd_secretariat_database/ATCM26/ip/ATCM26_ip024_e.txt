ASPA n° 128 – Western shore of the Admiralty Bay

In accordance with the Madrid Protocol (Annex V, Article 7), after careful consideration by the Environmental Evaluation Group, following the procedures set out on Annex I of the Protocol, the PROANTAR issued a permit for the project “Distribution, Abundance and Biology of Birds in the Admiralty Bay”, to carry out research activities in ASPA n° 128 – Western shore of the Admiralty Bay, King George Island (former SSSI n° 8). The objectives were to identify and register the areas of reproduction in the Admiralty Bay,  count the number and species of birds and sea mammals in the area, map the distribution of birds and mammals and compare the data obtained with historical records. The activities were performed by 6 researchers, from 13 November to 14 December 2002 and from the 01 to 05 March 2003, in the coastal region of the Admiralty Bay.

2.4.2 list of ieeS and cees 

All activities for the XXI Antarctic Operation were submitted to a preliminary assessment of environmental impact. Their predicted impacts were considered to be less than minor or transitory (< MT). According to Annex I of the Protocol, there was no need to perform any initial or Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations. The Preliminary Environmental Evaluations (PEE) are listed in annex A.


2.4.3. Waste Management Plans

Waste Treatment

All waste generated at the station is carefully sorted into four groups:

Group 1 – Sewage and domestic liquids
	The black water, after a primary  treatment, is directed to anaerobic filters, where it undergoes a secondary treatment. At the anaerobic filters the water is purified again, then it passes through filtration drains.
	The treatment system for grey water collects the wastewater from showers and directs them to a box that retains solid materials. From this box, the grey water passes through anaerobic filters and filtration drains that are not connected to the black water system. The black and grey waters final effluent is piped to the low tide line on the beach.
	The system has four septic cesspools, two anaerobic filters, two grease boxes and two intercepting boxes. To avoid the system and cesspool freezing, a thermal girdle was installed along the system and the septic cesspool. 

Group 2 – Liquid Chemicals and lubricants
	All lubricants and chemical liquid waste are stored and removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area by a support ship.

Group 3 – Combustible Solid Waste
	This group comprehends paper, wood, food, plastics and rubber (tires). Once a week, papers and food are burned in incinerators fitted with anti-pollutant filters. This process is continuously monitored for gas emission.  Wood, plastic and rubber are stored and removed, as in Group 2, from the Antarctic Treaty Area. 

Group 4 – Other solid waste
	Glass, aluminium, batteries, non liquid chemical waste, empty drums, incinerator ashes and other solid belonging to this group, are compacted in a hydraulic press, stored and removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area.  

Produced Waste Report (February of 2002 to January of 2003)
	
	Sewage and Domestic Liquids – 225 kg and 0.9 vol.
Obs: disposed at sea, macerated and cesspool
	
	Liquid Chemicals (including fuels and lubricants) – 825 kg and 5.37 vol.
		Obs: removed from Antarctic Treaty Area

	Combustible Solid Waste – 2402 kg and 18.94 vol.
		Obs: removed from Antarctic Treaty Area

	Other Solid Waste – 3063 kg and 11.16 vol.
		Obs: removed from Antarctic Treaty Area

2.6.2. Notice of activities undertaken in case of emergencies

	All expeditioners had to be evacuated from Elephant Island campsite to the NApOc Ary Rongel on 07 December 2002, as very harsh weather set in the area threatening life safety. Although the NApOc Ary Rongel has gone back to the area several times to recover the cargo and equipment left in the Island before heading back to Brazil, only part of the equipment could be recovered. Early next season the ship will retrieve these equipment on its way to the EACF.





Annual list of Brazilian Environmental Evaluations (2002-2003)

The Brazilian Antarctic Programme is currently conducting the XXI Antarctic Operation, which started on 05 November 2002, and terminates on 01 November 2003. Of the 33 approved scientific projects, 24 carried out field work at the Brazilian Antarctic Station “Comandante Ferraz” (EACF), and the Oceanographic and Support Ship “Ary Rongel”, during the 2002/2003 summer season.

All activities for the XXI Antarctic Operation were submitted to a preliminary assessment of environmental impact. Their predicted impacts were considered to be less than minor or transitory (< MT). According to Annex I of the Protocol, there was no need to perform any initial or Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations.

As required in terms of the Protocol I on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, pursuant to Annex I, Article 6, paragraph 1, we enclose below the annual list of Brazilian Preliminary Environmental Evaluations (PEE), prepared in accordance with Article 2.

The List below comprises only the projects, which undertook fieldwork.
