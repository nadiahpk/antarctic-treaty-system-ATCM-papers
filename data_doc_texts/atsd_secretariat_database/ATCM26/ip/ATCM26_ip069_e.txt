IAATO-Wide Emergency Contingency Plan
2003/2004


The following plan was provisionally agreed to at the IAATO 14th General Meeting, May 2003 and will be in place for the upcoming Antarctic season-2003-2004. It can be amended should international shipping regulations be changed or operators find more efficient and practical ways to work.

Vessels operating in Antarctica are required to operate under the ISM-code1 and consequently they must have a well-established Safety Management System (SMS) in place in addition to IAATO emergency contingency plans and recommendations. However, these systems can vary because there is not an international standardized format. In order to establish an IAATO-wide Emergency Response Plan we have to be aware of and accept these differences while simplifying the coordination of our common Emergency Plans.


1. The cornerstones for an IAATO-Wide emergency contingency and Search and Rescue Plans for Antarctic cruise vessels are the following:
    • Assurance that there is adequate emergency equipment available onboard all IAATO ships
    • Assurance that the ships’ schedules and positions are frequently updated
    • Effective communication via GMDSS including reporting schema for a possible event
    • Medical evacuation support


2. Emergency situations to consider are:
    • Ice damage to the hull, propeller and rudder
    • Heavy weather damage
    • Medical emergencies
    • Man overboard from the ship, Zodiacs, kayaks, etc.
    • Grounding and stranding
    • General oil spill from deck equipment, Zodiacs, boats, helicopters, etc.
    • Waste oil spill
    • Mechanical and/or steering failure
    • Power outage/blackout 
    • Fire
    • Collision
    • Security threat
    • Explosion


3. Some of the plans to deal with the above emergencies are as follows:
    • Damage control plan
    • Medical contingency plan
    • Search and Rescue plan
    • Fire plan
    • Oil spill and pollution plan (SOPEP)
    • Propulsion and steering failure plan
    • Security and threat plan
    • Evacuation and abandon ship plan
    • Plan for evacuation of passengers and crew from large cruise vessels 


4. Currently in place are the following: 
    • A well-established spreadsheet of vessel itineraries in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic
    • Improved communication via GMDSS
    • An established medical evacuation plan
    • A database detailing emergency equipment available on board all IAATO ships 
    • All ships are in compliance with ISM, MARPOL, SOLAS, etc
    • Agreement to assist each vessel in any emergency
    • Adequate insurance coverage
    • Engagement of only experienced and properly trained officers and crew, Ice Masters in compliance with Standards for Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW)


5. Recommended Preventive Measures: 
    • Encourage the use of very light Marine Gas Oil (MGO) fuel during the Antarctic season. Light MGO is a non-persistent fuel oil that will evaporate more quickly in the event of a spill.
    • Lubricating oil is persistent. In such case lubricating oil should be kept in low quantities, which will minimize the environmental impact from an accident.
    • Use of appropriate ships based on ice conditions
    • Naval Structure as referenced in the Arctic Shipping Guidelines
    • Oil spill contingency training
    • All collected Hydrographical data to be deposited with appropriate governmental offices
    • Participation in the Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue (AMVER) system


6. Future Work
    • Regular updates of the IAATO emergency equipment database
    • Compliance with the International Ship and Port Security Code, Voyage Data Recording systems, and Advanced Information Systems.
    • Enhancing training and certification requirements for zodiac drivers.
    • Increased medical emergency response capabilities in remote areas.

				           Appendix A
IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan
Flow Chart
Vessels are required to operate under the ISM-code and consequently they must have a well-established Safety Management System (SMS) in place.  The command center for any emergencies in Antarctica will always be the ship that is experiencing the emergency.  The Master of the distressed ship will be the commander for all the emergency response activities.  The Master of the ship experiencing the emergency can appoint a Master of another ship as the incident commander and the command center. However, the incident commander can only act on behalf of the distressed ship and will not have any legal obligations other than what is accepted under normal international shipping practice.		
The Master/Ship Operator shall have the authority to contract with emergency providers for all assistance required in compliance with their Safety Management System (SMS).
