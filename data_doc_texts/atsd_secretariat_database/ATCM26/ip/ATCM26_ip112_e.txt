THE ARCTIC STUDIES BY NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF POLAR RESEARCH, JAPAN


In 1990, the Arctic Environment Research Center (AERC) has been established in National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), cooperative institute among universities for the polar scientific research in Japan, aiming to conduct scientific researches in the Arctic, including comparative studies between the Antarctic and the Arctic.  The Arctic Environment Research Center has responded to the recommendations of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and has been promoting international cooperative research projects, “International Cooperative Project on Global Environment Research in the Arctic (1990 – 1994)”, “Arctic Environmental Observation (1995 – 1999)”, and “Special Scientific Program for the Arctic Environment (1999 - 2004)”.  The Arctic Environment Research Center opened the research station at Ny-Alesund, international scientific site, Svalbard, under the cooperation with the Norwegian Polar Institute.  The Arctic Environment Research Center gathers the information for all Japanese research in the Arctic and issues “Japanese Arctic Research Directory” under the editorial of Japan National Committee for Polar Research.

NIPR  Research

Atmospheric Science
Variations of Atmospheric Constituents and Their Climatic Impact in the Arctic
To study global scale atmospheric environmental fluctuations in the Arctic region, several points within the Arctic region have been selected, and an observational　network for studying trace constituents, cloudiness and precipitation in the atmosphere is being gradually　expanded. 

Glaciology
Research on Global and Local Environmental Variabilities Using Ice Cores Drilled Around the Arctic
For the purposes of obtaining the global scale　past and present environmental signals that are preserved in the Arctic cryosphere, and clarifying the role that　this cryosphere has played in the global environment, AERC has been participating in the Ice-core Circum-Arctic Paleoclimate Program (ICAPP) and the North-Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP).  In addition, we are conducting observations of the　atmosphere-cryosphere material exchange in eastern Siberia.

Marine Science
Research on Arctic Ocean Dynamics and Ecosystem Variability
With the aim of clarifying the effect of the oceans of the Arctic region on global scale environmental fluctuations, AERC is participating in international cooperative observations in　ice-free regions in the midst of ice-covered ocean, called　"polynyas", being promoted by the Arctic Ocean Sciences Board (AOSB) and is conducting oceanographic observations in Greenland Sea, Barents Sea and Baffin Bay.

Terrestrial Environment Science
Research on Environmental Change in the Arctic Tundra
To study the effect of global change on tundra ecological system, field research has been conducted in Svalbard, northern Norway, Siberia and Arctic Canada as a part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX).

Upper Atmospheric Physics 
Dynamic Coupling of the Middle Atmosphere and Thermosphere in the Arctic
To clarify the nature of atmospheric and electromagnetic environments in the Arctic middle and upper atmosphere, AERC has been conducting radio, radar and optical observations of the aurora and varieties of electromagnetic and atmospheric phenomena in conjunction with the EISCAT radar. 




NIPR  Arctic Station
In 1991, a research station was established at Ny-Ålesund (78°50′N, 11°55′E) on Spitsbergen Island in the Svalbard　Archipelago. It serves as a base for environmental　research in the field of atmospheric science, glaciology, terrestrial ecology and　oceanography. 

Japanese Research in the Arctic


Research Activity in 2000-2002
“Japanese Arctic Research Directory”, information bulletin with a compete listing of current Japanese scientific activity in the Arctic region, has been edited by Japan National Committee for Polar Research and annually issued by Arctic Environment Research Center, NIPR since 2000.
