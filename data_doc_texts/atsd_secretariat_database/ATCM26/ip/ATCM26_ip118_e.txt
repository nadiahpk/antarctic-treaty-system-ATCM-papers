A review of inspections under Article 7 of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of its Protocol on Environmental Protection, 1959- 2001



I.   Introduction

Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty enable Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to conduct inspections in order to promote the objectives and ensure compliance with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol.  

Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty establishes the right of free access for observation and inspection by the Contracting Parties.  Observers designed under Article VII (1) “shall have complete freedom of access”, including the conducting of aerial observations, “at any time to any or all areas of Antarctica.”  The facilities that may be inspected include “all stations, installations and equipment within those areas, and all ships and aircraft at points of discharging or embarking cargoes or personnel in Antarctica.”  

Article 14 of the Protocol establishes that Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties “shall arrange, individually or collectively, for inspections by observers to be made in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty.”  During inspections, observers should be given access to “all parts of stations, installations, equipment, ships and aircraft open to inspection under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty, and to all records” that are maintained at those facilities in accordance to Protocol requirements. 

According to current practice, draft inspection reports are submitted to the inspected Parties for comments.  They are subsequently made available to the Antarctic Treaty Parties and to the Committee for Environmental Protection, considered at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting that follows the inspection, and thereafter made publicly available.

This report reviews past inspections with the view to inform the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties on the practice of inspections and assist them in planning future inspections.  In agreement with the objectives of the Protocol, including its Article 14, the purpose of this report is to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.  

The report focuses specifically on a number of aspects including: total number of official inspections and inspected sites or facilities; trends in official inspection frequency; geographical distribution of official inspections; Parties conducting inspections; official inspection frequency at each site or facility; official inspections of commercial tourism activities and non-governmental facilities; and, site or facility review visits carried by Non-Parties.


II.   Methodology 

A) List of inspections 

A tentative list of past inspections carried out under the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol between 1959 and 2001 was compiled by the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC).  The compiled list is reproduced in Annex I.  The list was based on:  

 Inspection reports, some of which list earlier inspections to a site or facility;
 A list of inspections contained in Annex E to the Final Report of the XVIII ATCM;
 A list of inspections contained in Working Paper 34 submitted by Australia to the XXV ATCM.  
With technical support from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), a set of maps were created to visualize the geographical distribution of past inspections, as well as to represent some other aspects of inspections in a spatial context.  These maps are at Appendix I.    


B) List of sites and facilities 

There is no official list of all sites and facilities in Antarctica.  Such a list would help identify sites and facilities that have not yet been inspected.  

The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) has posted on its web site a list of Antarctic stations. As of May 2003, the list contains 82 stations, of which 73 are located within the Antarctic Treaty Area (see Annex II). The COMNAP’s list, however, mentions primarily stations that are currently operational.  As such, it does not include all the sites or facilities that had been inspected so far.  Indeed, there are 32 inspected sites or facilities — excluding vessels — that are not on COMNAP’s list.  In addition, there are National Antarctic Programmes for which the main stations are listed but not the additional facilities, such as substantial field camps.  

The United Kingdom’s Antarctic Pilot and the SCAR’s Gazetter provide more comprehensive lists of Antarctic sites and facilities.  The 1997 edition of the Antarctic Pilot lists 177 research stations and refuge huts inside the Antarctic Treaty Area, 27 aircraft landing places, 20 Specially Protected Areas, 35 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and 72 Historic Sites and Monuments.  However, it is likely that there are sites and facilities that are not reflected in those lists.  In this regard, it is hoped that a more complete compilation of sites and facilities will be developed as Parties to the Protocol implement Art 8 (3) of Annex III of the Protocol, which requires that “Each such Party shall, as far as is practicable, also prepare an inventory of locations of past activities (such as traverses, fuel depots, field bases, crashed aircraft) before the information is lost…”.

For the purpose of this review, an ad hoc list of sites and facilities was produced that included in extenso the COMNAP’s list and derived additional information from the Antarctic Pilot.  The ad hoc list is given at Annex III.  

It is clear that the tentative list of inspections and the ad hoc list of sites and facilities prepared for the purpose of this report are not exhaustive.  In addition, both lists may contain erroneous information.  ASOC would very much welcomed comments from Parties that could help improve both lists towards a more comprehensive review of the practice of inspection in Antarctica.

III.  Results

A) Total number of official inspections and inspected sites or facilities

The total number of official inspections1 conducted between 1959 and 2001 is 36, of which nine were carried out between 1992 and 2001, and four in the period 1998-20012 (see Table 1).

The total number of inspected sites or facilities3 between 1959 and 2001 is 265, of which 89 were inspected between 1992 and 2001, and 46 in the period 1998-20014.  


B) Trends in official inspection frequency 

The frequency of official inspections increased during the 1959-2001 period from 0.82 inspections per annum during the period 1959-1991, to 0.83 for 1992-1997, and to 1 for 1998-2001 (see Fig.1).  

The frequency of inspected sites or facilities increased during the 1959-2001 period from 5.3 inspected sites or facilities per annum during the period 1959-1991, to 7.2 for 1992-1997, and 11.5 for 1998-2001 (see Fig.2).  

A peak in both the number of official inspections and in the number of inspected sites or facilities was recorded in the years immediately following the adoption of the 1988 Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities.

C) Geographical distribution of official inspections

In order to help appreciate the geographical distribution of official inspections, the Antarctic has been divided in nine regions, namely Antarctic Peninsula; Central Antarctica; East Antarctica; Ellsworth Land/Marie Byrd Land; Oates Coast; Queen Maud Land; Ross Sea; South Orkney Islands; and, Weddell Sea.  Of the 36 inspections carried out between 1959 and 2001, 22 took place in a single distinct region of Antarctica, five in two regions, and eight to facilities located in more than two regions.  The majority of the 22 inspections to a single region took place in the Antarctic Peninsula (15), followed by Queen Maud Land and East Antarctica (three each) and the Ross Sea (one).  

The majority of the inspected sites or facilities were located in the Antarctic Peninsula (48.3 %), followed by East Antarctica (12.1 %), Queen Maud Land (9.1 %) and the Ross Sea (7.9 %) (see Table 2).   This reflects the density of facilities in these areas that is a function of ease of access to these areas (which, in turn, might have influenced the choice of facilities selected for inspection).

D) Parties conducting inspections

Sixteen of the 27 Consultative Parties have conducted one or more inspections between 1959 and 2001, namely: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, New Zealand, South Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States of America, and the Russian Federation (see Table 3).  However, eleven Consultative Parties have never conducted inspections during that period, namely:  Bulgaria, Ecuador, Finland, India, Japan, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Uruguay.

(*)  Some inspections were undertaken jointly: Belgium and France (1999), United Kingdom and Germany (1999), United Kingdom, Italy and South Korea (1993), France and Germany (1989) and United Kingdom and New Zealand (1989).



E) Official inspection frequency at each site or facility

Of the 73 stations in the COMNAP’s list, that are located within the Antarctic Treaty Area, 51 (70%) have been inspected and 22 (30%) have never been inspected (see Table 4).  Of the 51 stations in COMNAP’s list that have been inspected, 38 (75%) have been inspected after October 1991, and 26 (51%) after January 1998.  The 13 stations that have not been inspected since October 1991 are listed in Table 5.

46 sites or facilities have been inspected two or more times since 1959 and 15 have been inspected five or more times since 1959 (see Table 6).

Official inspections have taken place to an additional 32 sites or facilities that are not in the COMNAP’s list.  Of these, 21 sites or facilities (41%) have been inspected after October 1991, and 18 (28%) have been inspected after January 1998.

F) Official inspections to commercial tourism activities and to non-governmental facilities

The inspection of commercial tourism activities has been limited to the inspection of tourist vessels. Of the 10 vessels inspected since 1959, five were tourist vessels, and all have been inspected since October 1991.  The number of tourist vessels currently operating in Antarctica on regular basis is in excess of 20, with a capacity varying between 6 and 1,200 passengers.   

Industry sources list at least 114 sites in the Antarctic Peninsula where tourist landings occur, and a further 83 sites elsewhere in Antarctica.8 The frequency of landing varies greatly, with some sites being visited very often and others rarely, and with much higher numbers of tourists visiting the Antarctic Peninsula.  In the past few years the five most visited sites in the Antarctic Peninsula received between 1,500-7,000 visitors during the tourism season.  The most visited sites elsewhere in Antarctica received some hundreds visitors during the tourism season (IAATO 2003).  Some tourist landing sites could be the subject of an official inspection.  

There is a land-based commercial tourist facility located in the Patriot Hills, which provides support to commercial or private expeditions to the interior of Antarctica.  That facility has never been inspected.

Non-governmental facilities that have never been inspected include a hut maintained by Czech nationals at Rip Point, Nelson Island, and a hut maintained by Australian nationals in Commonwealth Bay (which may have already been removed).  

A site, formerly the base camp of the “Footsteps of Scott Expedition” (1984-1986) and later Greenpeace’s World Park Base (1988-1991) at Cape Evans, Ross Island, was never inspected formally, although it was visited by Consultative Parties’ officials at several occasions. The base structures and all other materials were removed by Greenpeace in the 1991-1992 austral summer. In November 1992 officials associated with the (then) New Zealand Antarctic Programme visited the site and produced a summary report (Sheppard and Deeley 1992).


G) Site or facility review visits carried out by Non-Parties  

The international environmental organization Greenpeace carried out unofficial review visits to a total of 162 sites or facilities since 1988, two of which were to its former base site. These visits focused on the environmental performance of Antarctic operations and took place in the Antarctic Peninsula, Oates Coast and the Ross Sea (Greenpeace 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997).  They generally provided information comparable to that of official inspections under Article 14 of the Protocol. Over fifteen sites visited by Greenpeace, including refuges, huts and decommissioned stations, have not been the subject of official inspections.










IV.   Compliance with the Protocol

The inspections that took place since the entry into force of the Protocol reported general compliance with the objectives and provisions of the Protocol at all sites inspected.  However, some inspection reports  noted some elements of implementation falling short of the requirements of the Protocol, including some instances of non-compliance with the requirements of Annex III. The inspection reports recommended improvements in several areas, including: fuel transfer and storage; energy efficiency and use of alternative energy; management of former sites (abandoned stations); waste management; and, sewage treatment.  

ASOC and UNEP intend to review the compliance with the Protocol based on inspection reports and submit this information to a future meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection.



V.   Conclusions and recommendations

The inspection system is essential to the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection.  Inspections provide critical information on the level of compliance with the Treaty and the Protocol’s provisions and help identify issues that need further attention from the Parties. They are also learning experiences for both the inspected Parties and for the Parties conducting the inspection. 

The XVIII ATCM Final Report notes “Parties should provide corrections and additions so that more complete lists could be published in the reports of future ATCMs.”  The review of past inspections conducted by ASOC and UNEP aimed at complementing existing compilations and assisting Parties in planning future inspections.  

Based on the review, it appears that future inspections could usefully focus on:

     Stations that have never been inspected or not been inspected since the adoption of the Protocol;
     Stations of Parties that have never or seldom had inspections to their facilities;
     Inland stations;
     Decommissioned, abandoned or infrequently used sites or facilities;
     Stations that have been inspected and have shown repeatedly that some aspects of their operations are falling short of the Protocol’s requirements;
     Other sites or facilities that are not stations (such as field huts, fuel depots, drilling sites);
     Ships, including vessels engaged in tourism and other non-governmental activities; and,
     Sites where tourism operations frequently take place.
