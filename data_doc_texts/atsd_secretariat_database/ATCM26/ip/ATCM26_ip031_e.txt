ANTARCTICA

Introduction :

The study of infectious pathologies on marine mammals has acquired increasing importance in countries of the Northern Hemisphere. This is reflected in the modern bibliography about serological studies on viral and bacterial diseases, cultures of microorganisms which has caused pathogenic problems in marine mammals tissues of the Northern Hemisphere.

Different situation is observed in the Antarctic fauna, where it is possible to find isolated references about this topic, some of which were given by  Laws and Taylor, 1957, Stirling, 1969, Tierney, 1977, Panagis et al., 1982, Bengtson and Boveng, 1991, Harder et al., 1991, Junin and Castello, 1995, McFarlane, 1996.

Recently in Chile, as a part of the Project INACH 018 "Ecological studies on the Antarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella" we have prepared several reports about the evidences of some diseases occurred in two species of Antarctic Pinnipeds from the ASPA Nº149 and CEMP Site Nº 2 "Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Islets" (62º 47' S., 60º 27' W.), Livingston Island, Antarctica, which were presented to the CCAMLR meetings, as well as published in some scientific journals.

The CCAMLR Scientific Committee, jointly with designating this scientific research as important, recommended that the new information produced were presented to the CEP, as a significant manner to call attention to this problem. Therefore, the purpose of this note is to give a synthesis of diseases found in the EAPA Nº149, to be discussed in the next CEP Meeting during the ATCM in Madrid, June 2003.

The findings

Since the Antarctic summer season 1998/1999, when this scientific research started, the diseases findings at the site were:

    1. Serological evidence of infection by Brucella sp. in Arctocephalus gazella, where a first analysis recorded a 35% of reactionant sera (Retamal et al., 2000), and 5.8% in a second evaluation for a bigger sample size (Blank et al., 2001a).
    2. Serological evidence of infection by Brucella sp. in Leptonychotes weddelli, where a positve reaction was found in the unique specimen studied (Retamal et al, 2000), and 41.7% of seropositivity in a second evaluation for a bigger sample size (Blank et al., 2002a).

    3. Serological evidence of infection by Alphaherpesvirinae, potencially phocine herpesvirus in A. gazella, with 7.4% of seropositivity (Blank et al., 2001b).

    4. Finding of histopathological granulomatosic tuberculosis lessions, in liver samples, linphatic nodes and enteric mucosae in histological samples from A. gazella collected during necropsies procedures (Blank et al., 2002b).

These results are the first evidence of infection by Brucella sp in A. gazella and L. weddelli, and the first record of infection by Brucella sp. in marine mammals of the Southern Hemisphere.

In the Northern Hemisphere there are many bibliographic antecedents about the infection of some species of marine mammals with one Brucella species which has been nominated as Brucella maris (Claverau, et al., 1998). Apparently, Brucella would be able to produce abortion in female specimens of marine mammals affected (Ewalt et al., 1994). This kind of infection has been also isolated from human beings, confirming its zoonotic character (Ross et al., 1996), and due to this fact, it could be possible that the infection in marine mammals from the Antarctic waters may have the same behavior.

The findings reported about phocine herpes virus (PhHV-1) at Cape Shirreff, are the first evidence of the infection in A. gazella. The herpesvirus are classified in two groups according to the host infected, being Herpesvirus Phocino-1 (PhHV-1) an Alphaherpesvirinae detected mainly in Pinnipeds from the Arctic and Antarctic waters (Daoust et al., 1994; Stuen et al., 1994; Stenvers et al., 1994), whose isolation has been done from samples of Phoca vitulina in Eurpe (Osterhaus et al., 1985).  In the Antarctic waters, infection evidences in L. weddelli and Lobodon carcinophagus have been detected (Harder et al., 1991). It has not been recognized as an important patogen since the herpes virus is characterized by producing latent and persistent infection in susceptible hosts and its presence is sub diagnosticated. Its reactivation may generate micro and macroscopic lesions in the affected tissues, having a direct relation with the individual immunologic system status and host age, which may determine the illness strength that in some cases may cause the death of the infected individual.

The tuberculosis digestive lesions in A. gazella from Cape Shirreff were two findings from necropsies practiced in 14 studied cases. This kind of lesions was the cause of one pup's death (Blank et al., 2002b). The tuberculosis in wild marine mammals has been less studied and it seems to be restricted to Pinnipeds. These findings are the first evidence of tuberculosis granulomatosic lesions for A. gazella, and for the Antarctic waters. There are previous antecedents of tuberculosis infections in individuals of other fur seal species, such as A. australis in Argentina (Bernardelli et al., 1996), A. pusillus doriferus in Australia (Woods et al., 1995), and A. forsteri from New Zealand as respiratory form (SRU, 1998). Besides tuberculosis has been recorded in captive specimens of Neophoca cinerea and A. forsteri, in Australia (Cawthorn, 1994). Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease of zoonotic potential.
From these three reported diseases, two have a zoonotic potential, if including the seal finger event reported in a scientist who had contact with A. gazella in the same study area (Vargas et al., 2002). All this evidence the needing to instruct scientists to prevent infection of diseases transmitted from animals to humans.


Conclusions:

Upon the basis of the above given antecedents, it is concluded that it is necessary to carry out complementary studies in order to obtain more information about the sanitary situation of other wild Antarctic species and populations to contribute to the scientific knowledge and provide new administrative measures for the management of the Antarctic marine living resources. This is coherent from the ecological point of view, since it is possible to recognize some detrimental pathologies as a variable which affect directly the population dynamic of wild Antarctic animals.

On the other hand, it is necessary to undertake scientific research on this topic in order to be able to discriminate between diseases of Antarctic animals and those which eventually may be transferred from the outside of the Antarctic environmental (imported diseases by a potential biological pollution or by a non described natural transmission), taking into account the anthropic activity on this ecosystem, as it has been the characteristic of latest years.

It is fundamental to asses the sanitary situation of the wild populations of Antarctic vertebrates through a monitoring program, as well as to estimate its effects on the population dynamics of affected species and to improve the knowledge of their epidemiology. These studies may be used as a complementary indicator of the human impact on that ecosystem, and to improve the protection measures on the potential biological pollution into Antarctica, to improve the management plans of natural renewable resources and to increase the scientific knowledge on the wild Antarctic diseases and its prevention for the human population who work on them.
