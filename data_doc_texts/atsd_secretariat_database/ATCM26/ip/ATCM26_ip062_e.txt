REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE 17 OF THE PROTOCOL

Information Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection
by the United Kingdom



Introduction

Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires each Party to report annually on the steps that they have taken to implement the Protocol. Such reports should include how each Party has ensured compliance with the Protocol including, through the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative actions and enforcement measures (Article 13(3) of the Protocol refers).

Article 17 also requires each Party to report on contingency plans established for response to incidents with potential adverse effects on the Antarctic environment and associated ecosystems (Article 15(1)(b) of the Protocol refers).  Further to this, Resolution 1 (1997) recommends Parties to carry out regular contingency exercises and to report on the results of the exercises.

This report covers all such UK activities and actions for the period 2002-2003. 

Administrative Actions

No further primary legislation concerning the Protocol has entered into force in the UK since ATCM XXIII, when it was reported that the provisions of the Antarctic Act 1994 were fully in force.  The 2002-2003 austral season was the fifth season when all of the provisions of the Antarctic Act 1994 were implemented.
The UK is now fully up to date with approval of Measures under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty. This includes Measure 1 (2002), the subsequent approval of which  was held under the procedures of Article 6 of Annex V to the Protocol. Measure 1 was incorporated into UK law by means of the Antarctic (Amendment) Regulations 2003, this came into force on 17 February, 2003. The UK has decided not to approve certain previous recommendations because they have in effect been superseded by subsequent instruments. For example Recommendation XIV-3, by Annex I of the Protocol, and Recommendation XV-3 and 4, by Annex 3 and 4 respectively.

A list of all permits issued under the Antarctic Act 1994 for the 2002-2003 season is attached as an Annex to this paper.
Disaster Contingency Exercise

In accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol and Article 12 of Annex IV, the UK has continued to revise and update its contingency plans for UK ships and bases in Antarctica.

Exercise Report

A oil spill contingency exercise was held jointly with the United States in Antarctica on 25 January 2003. The exercise involved the US research vessel Laurence M. Gould  and the UK Rothera Research Station. The accident scenario was that the ‘Gould’ struck a submerged object whilst docking at Rothera wharf and spilt approximately 8000 litres of marine gas oil from a fuel tank before the leak could be stopped. Crew from the ‘Gould’ and the Rothera spill-response team worked together to contain the simulated spillage by deploying boats, booms, pumps and emergency fuel storage tanks. The response was fast and effective, and within forty minutes all clean-up equipment had been deployed successfully.
