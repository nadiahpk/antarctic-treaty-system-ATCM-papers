STATEMENT OF THE DELEGATION OF GREECE

OPENING ADDRESS BY MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY
EXPERT, DR. EMMANUEL GOUNARIS, HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF GREECE.


Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the Greek Delegation, I would like to congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the XXVI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. May I also through you Mr. Chairman, express my gratitude to the Government of Spain for hosting this meeting in the beautiful city of Madrid and also my thanks for its warm hospitality.

Mr. Chairman, Greece believes that it is in the interest of all nations to preserve Antarctica and its waters, for peaceful purposes only and to guard against their becoming the scene of object of international discord.

Mr. Chairman, Greece as a state party of the Antarctic Treaties and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty likes to express its gratitude for the establishment of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat. All of us need this Secretariat, especially the Non-Consultative Parties.

At the same time Greece likes to express its hope that the efforts for the establishment of the Liability Annex will have very soon a successful result.

Mr. Chairman, Greece is also particularly concerned about the ozone layer over Antarctica and support in this matter, any action and suggestions of SCAR and the non-governmental organizations ECO and ASOC, necessary to ensure the earliest possible recovery of the ozone layer.

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
