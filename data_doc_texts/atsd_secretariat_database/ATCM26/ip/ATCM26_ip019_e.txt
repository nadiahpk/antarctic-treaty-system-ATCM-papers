Relevance of Developments 
in the Arctic and the Antarctic
(Review of the documents submitted at ATCM XIX – XXV)


For the first time, the need to negotiate the developments in the Arctic and the Antarctic at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) was raised by the  delegation of Chile at the XVIII ATCM in 1994. By suggestion of Chilean delegation,  the desirability to consider the issues of the Protocol on Environmental Protection jointly with the other similar universal international agreements related to the Arctic region and its environmental protection, was emphasized. 
At the XIX ATCM in 1995, the agenda of the meeting included the issue “Applicability of Developments in the Arctic to the Antarctic” where the need in a more extensive exchange of the information related to the Arctic and Antarctic environment, was considered. In particular, the Canadian government got recommendations to provide for the next ATCM a final report of the Ministerial Meeting of the Arctic States on the strategy of environmental protection of the Northern polar area. The above report was presented by Canada at the XX ATCM, and many of the participants welcomed the Canadian report on the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy. The meeting on the Arctic issues was attended by the Netherlands delegation- the Host Government of XX ATCM which expressed an expectation that the international cooperation of the countries of the Arctic region would result in the official establishment of the Arctic Council, in the nearest time. It was noted with satisfaction, that beginning with 1994 a lot had been done for coordination of the activity of the countries in the Arctic and the Antarctic. It was underlined that the co-ordination issues required special attention to the fact that the political and legal context governing activities in the Arctic and the Antarctic differed considerably. The XX ATCM believed that the exchange of information should not be confined only to environmental protection issues, as there was a wide range of technical and scientific projects undertaken in the Arctic and this experience could be used in the Antarctica, as well. 
The XX ATCM recommended that in consideration of the developments interrelation in both of the polar regions, their economical, technical, scientific or logistic aspects would be dealt with as well  as their political and administrative aspects. 

The total of 11 documents were provided by Chile, Canada, Republic of Korea, Finland, Russia, Norway for the agenda of the meetings beginning with the XIX ATCM up to the XXV ATCM (Table 1)

The analysis of the documents presented at the ATCM shows that in their majority (10) they were dedicated to the issues of co-ordination of developments in the Arctic and the Antarctic “Coordination and Relevance of Developments in the Arctic and the Antarctic”. With this, as results from the original suggestions, they deal mostly with the aspects of environmental protection of the regions and scientific aspects. 

Taking into account that the above issue has never dealt with the aspects of technical, political and legal character, we deem necessary to put off the XXVII ATCM agenda issues “Relevance of Developments in the Arctic and the Antarctic” for the VII meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection, especially as the political and legal aspects in the Antarctic area have been discussed sufficiently in full within such ATCM agenda items as the “Improvement of the Antarctic Treaty System”, “Liability”, etc,

Let us remind that the Arctic Council was established as an international organization dedicated to provide assistance in the sphere of environmental protection, to ensure stable development of near-polar regions, and not to take decisions on the political and legal aspects in the region.
