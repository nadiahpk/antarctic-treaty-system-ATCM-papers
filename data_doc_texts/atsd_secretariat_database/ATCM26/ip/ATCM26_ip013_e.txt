Report of the Depositary Government


	The United States submits the annexed report as the Depositary Government of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol in accordance with Recommendation XIII-2.  It is requested that every Party to the Treaty examine the report carefully and report as soon as possible any errors or omissions.

	The United States wishes to remind all Parties of the importance of timely approval of Recommendations/Measures.  As the annexed report indicates, a handful of countries have not taken action on Recommendations dating back more than ten years, and in one case as far back as twenty years.  The approvals of just a few remaining countries would bring a substantial number of Recommendations into effect.  The United States therefore strongly urges all Parties to take the necessary actions within their legal and administrative systems to approve all outstanding Recommendations and Measures as quickly as possible.    

	The United States also calls the Parties’ attention to the list of Arbitrators designated in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Schedule to the Protocol.  The Parties are reminded that each of them is entitled to designate up to three Arbitrators and must at all times maintain the name of at least one Arbitrator on the list.  An Arbitrator may remain on the list for a period of five years, but may also be redesignated for additional five-year periods.  Those Arbitrators listed on last year’s report who were designated prior to May 1998 have been removed from this year’s list and should either be redesignated or replaced.  Others remaining on this year’s list who were also designated in 1998, whose terms will expire soon, should similarly be redesignated or replaced.
