REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING XXVI BY THE DEPOSITARY GOVERNMENT FOR THE CONVENTION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC SEALS (UNITED KINGDOM) IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECOMMENDATION XIII-2, PARAGRAPH 2(d)



    1. This report covers events regarding the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) for the reporting year 1 March 2001 to 29 February 2002. As the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXVI is being held before the close of the 2003 reporting year, on 30 June 2003, it has not been possible to report for this year. However an update of activities during the 2001/2002 year is reproduced at Annex A. Events prior to 1 March 2001 were reported to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV and XXV (see respective Annexes in each report).

    2. The United Kingdom would like to remind Contracting Parties to CCAS that the reporting period for the Exchange of Information is from 1 March to end of February each year. The reporting period was changed to the above dates during the September 1988 Meeting to Review the Operation of the Convention. This is documented in Paragraph 19(a) of the Report of that Meeting. 

    3. The Exchange of Information, referred to in Paragraph 6(a) in the Annex to the Convention, should be submitted to other Contracting Parties and to SCAR by 30 June each year, including nil returns. Currently, not all the information required in paragraph 6(a) is being provided. Neither is it being provided on time or with any ì¥Á29 	22ð¿2222222222222šµ22
