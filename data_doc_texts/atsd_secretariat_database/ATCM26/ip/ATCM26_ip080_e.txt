Revised Description and Management Plan for Sites of Special Scientific Interest
Measure 2 
[Revised Description and Management Plan for Sites of Special Scientific Interest]
The Representatives of the Consultative Parties,
Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty;
For the Site of Special Scientific Interest mentioned below:
(i). the Management Plan inserted in the Annex to Recommendation XIII-8 Facilitation of scientific research: Sites of Special Scientific Interest, be deleted;
(ii). the Management Plan of the Site of Special Scientific Interest, annexed to this Recommendation, be inserted in the Annex to Recommendation XIII-8 Facilitation of scientific research: Sites of Special Scientific Interest.
The Site of Special Scientific Interest concerned is:
SSSI No. 11 Tramway Ridge, Mt. Erebus, Ross Island.

Management Plan for Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 11: Tramway Ridge Mt. Erebus, Ross Island
(following in document)
Revised Management Plan for SSSI 11: Tramway Ridge 
(becomes ASPA 130 in XX-R5)

Superseded by XXV-M1:  

Measure 1 (2002)
Antarctic Protected Area System: Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas
The Representatives, 
Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for approval in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 6 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty:
That the Management Plans for the following sites:
    • Antarctic Specially Protected Area No 130, “Tramway Ridge”, Mount Erebus, Ross Island;
and which are annexed to this Measure, be adopted.

Extension of the Expiry Dates for Sites of Special Scientific Interest

Resolution 7 (1995)
Extension of the Expiry Dates
for Sites of Special Scientific Interest

The Representatives of the Consultative Parties,
Recalling Recommendations VIII-3 and XII-5
Noting that:
i)' experience of the practical effect of the Management Plans for these sites has shown them to be an effective means of reducing the risks of harmful interference in areas of special interest;
Recommend that:
1. The date of the expiry of Site Numbers 1, 3, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21 be extended from 31 December 1995 to 31 December 2000.
2. The Governments of the Consultative Parties should use their best endeavours to ensure, in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Recommendation VII-3, that the Management Plans for these sites are complied with.
Spent: all dates have expired

Uniform Model for Management Plans

Resolution 9 (1995)
Uniform Model for Management Plans
Representatives of the Consultative Parties,
Recalling the requests made by ATCM XVII and ATCM XVIII that SCAR' Should assist Parties in reviewing and revising Management Plans to conform with provisions of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and consider how a model could be developed to facilitate the preparation of new and revised Management Plans;
Recognising that a uniform model for such plans would eliminate repetition and would make them easier to use;
Recommend that:
The structure of the Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 13, adopted under Measure 1, be regarded as a model of all new and revised Management Plans for protected areas for the purposes of Annex V.
SPA No 13 to become model format 
(becomes ASPA 109 in XX-R5)

Superseded/made obsolete by XXII-R2 which states that:
In 1995 at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) XIX, Resolution 9/95 was adopted. This recommended that the Moe Island (SPA number 13) Management Plan be regarded as a model for the preparation of new and revised Plans for certain ASPAs. The Moe Island Plan is provided in Appendix 2. It should be recognised that this plan will not be a useful model in all circumstances. Since the development of Management Plans for ASPAs is an evolving process, preparers of Management Plans are strongly urged to consult more recent examples agreed at subsequent ATCMs. Those preparing Plans should be aware of current best practice.

Resolution III (1996)
Extension of the Expiry Dates for Sites of Special Scientific Interest
The Representatives,
Recalling Recommendations VIII-3 and XII-5, and Resolution 7/1995;
Noting that experience of the practical effect of the Management Plans for these sites has shown them to be an effective means of reducing the risks of interference with science in areas of special scientific interest; and
Conscious of the advantage of further harmonising the expiry dates of Sites of Special Scientific Interest pending the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Annex V to that Protocol.
Recommend that;
1. The date of expiry of Sites of Special Scientific Interest numbers 13 and 20 which were considered at XIX ATCM be extended to 31 December 2000.

Recommendations, Measures, Decisions and Resolutions

Resolution 1 (2001)
The Representatives,
Conscious of the ever increasing number of decisions of various kinds taken by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings;

Taking account of Decision 1 (1995) adopted at the XIX ATCM in Seoul, in which decisions of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings are classified according to their applicability and effect as respectively Measures, Decisions and Resolutions, and in which the approval procedure of Article IX-4 is reserved for Measures;

Noting that since 1995, 16 new Measures have been adopted by the (S)ATCM and that, in the meantime, no recommendations later than those of the XI ATCM (Buenos Aires, 1981) have been approved by all Consultative Parties concerned;

Noting that consequently, the gap between measures adopted by the ATCM and measures subsequently approved and now effective has continued to grow;

Desiring to achieve a better understanding of which measures, whether approved or not, have in the meantime been superseded;

Recommend that intersessional consultations be held to prepare a Decision, to be adopted at the XXV ATCM, determining which of the Recommendations, adopted by the I to the XVIII ATCM, have been superseded by subsequent Recommendations, Measures, Decisions or Resolutions or can be considered obsolete for other reasons.
Superseded by XXV-D3:
Decision 3 (2002)
The Status of ATCM Recommendation
The Representatives,
Conscious of the significant number of measures* adopted by previous Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings;
Desiring to clarify which of these measures, whether approved or not, still require action by the Parties;
Recognising that some of these measures are spent as a result of the passing of a specific event, or of time;
Recognising also that the review of measures is an ongoing process required to maintain an accurate record of the instruments of the ATCM, and their content if relevant;
Decide that, 
the measures listed in Annex A are spent, and, as such, these measures will require no further action by the Parties; and
the Parties will continue the review of measures adopted at ATCM I to XXIV, on an informal basis intersessionally so that further consideration can be undertaken at ATCM XXVI concerning which other measures may be considered spent, superseded or otherwise obsolete.

Support for CCAMLR and its Measures to Combat Illegal, Unregulated and
Unrestricted Fishing, Including a Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp. (Toothfish).
The Representatives,
Recalling ATCM XXII Resolution 3 (1999) regarding Support for the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in its efforts to deal with the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Convention Area;
Recalling also that the Preamble to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol) reaffirms the conservation principles of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources;
Recognising that the Objective of the Protocol (Article 2) is for Parties to commit themselves to the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems;
Noting that the Eighteen Meeting of the Commission to CCAMLR has introduced a Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp. to identify the origins of Dissostichus spp. entering the markets of Contracting Parties and to determine whether Dissostichus spp. harvested in the Convention Area were caught in a manner consistent with CCAMLR Conservation Measures; and
Noting further that as part of that Scheme, the Commission invites non-Contracting Parties (to CCAMLR) whose vessels fish for Dissostichus spp. to participate in the Catch Documentation Scheme.
Recommend that:
All Parties to the Antarctic Treaty which are not Contracting Parties to CCAMLR and whose flag vessels fish for toothfish, or who are involved in the trade of toothfish, participate in, or comply voluntarily with, the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp.
The whole of this Resolution appears to be superseded, first by XXIV-R2 and then by XXV-R3:

Recognizing that the Objective of the Protocol (Article 2) is for Parties to commit themselves to the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems;
Recalling that the Eighteenth Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources introduced a Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp. to identify the origins of Dissostichus spp. entering the markets of Contracting Parties and to determine whether Dissostichus spp. harvested in the Convention area were caught in a manner consistent with CCAMLR Conservation Measures; 
Recalling also that as part of that Scheme, the Commission invited non-Contracting Parties to the Convention whose vessels fish for Dissostichus spp. to participate in the Catch Documentation Scheme; 
Welcoming efforts by some key non-Contracting Parties involved in trade in Dissostichus spp. to participate in the Catch Documentation Scheme;
Noting with satisfaction that the adoption, under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization, of the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in February 2001, will assist the Commission to address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Convention Area; and
Welcoming recent accessions to the Convention by Namibia and Vanuatu, States not party to the Antarctic Treaty;

Recommend that:
All Parties to the Antarctic Treaty which are not Contracting Parties to the Convention or Members of the Commission, and whose flag vessels fish for toothfish or who are involved in the trade of toothfish, implement the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp.
Appears to be superseded by XXV-R3:

RESOLUTION 3 (2002) XXV-R3

Support for CCAMLR and Action to Combat Illegal , Unreported and Unregulated Fishing for Dissostichus spp (toothfish)

The Representatives,

Recommend that:
All parties to the Antarctic Treaty which are Party to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine living Resources, but not yet members of its Commission, take steps to implement all relevant Conservation Measures adopted by CCAMLR, in particular Measures relating to the Dissostichus Catch Documentation Scheme; and Parties to the Antarctic Treaty which are not Party to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources but which nevertheless are involved in the harvesting and trade of toothfish, consider acceding to the Convention and, in the meantime, agree voluntarily to implement the Dissostichus Catch Documentation Scheme.

List of Specially Protected Species: Annex II to the Environmental Protocol

Resolution 2 (1999) 
List of Specially Protected Species: Annex II to the Environmental Protocol
The Representatives,
Noting that the provisions of Article 8 of the Annex II to the Environmental Protocol require that the Consultative Parties keep under continuing review measures for the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, taking into account any recommendations from the Committee for Environmental Protection;
Aware that there has been no review of the list of Specially Protected Species in Appendix A to Annex II since the list was originally adopted by the consultative Parties in the 1964 Agreed Measures (Recommendation III-8);
Aware also that consideration needs to be given to including other species of fauna and flora on the list of Specially Protected Species as appropriate;
Recommend that:
1. SCAR be requested, in consultation with Consultative Parties, CCAMLR and other expert bodies as appropriate, to review the list of Specially Protected Species referred to in Article 3 (4) of Annex II and listed in Appendix A to the Environmental Protocol.
2. The following Terms of Reference should be used by SCAR:
i) Examine the status of those species which:
    • are native to the Antarctic Treaty Area or occur there seasonally through natural migration; and 
    • whose status might be of concern. 
ii) With the assistance of IUCN, use the information contained in the IUCN Red Lists to help determine the conservation status of native Antarctic fauna and flora;
iii) Provide expert scientific advise to the Committee on Environmental Protection as to which species should remain, or be designated as Specially Protected Species.

Advice from COMNAP and SCAR

The Representatives,
Recalling Resolution 6 (1998) regarding Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning;
Considering that further work on preventative measures and on response action would promote progress on the issue of addressing liability for damage to the Antarctic environment;
Recording the appreciation of the Meeting for the valuable information regarding Antarctic environmental risks contained in XXIII ATCM / WP 16 presented by COMNAP, and for the participation of COMNAP and SCAR at the present Meeting during discussion of the question of liability for environmental harm;
Request that COMNAP and SCAR
1. Continue to provide representatives throughout all meetings of the Consultative Parties at which the question of liability is discussed.
2. Drawing on their respective areas of expertise, and in consultation with other appropriate bodies, provide advice in a joint Working Paper to XXIV ATCM. The Working Paper should discuss the operational and scientific aspects of preventative measures and response action, with a view to aiding the ATCM in its understanding of these practical aspects in order to facilitate work on liability issues. In addition to possible examples of preventative measures and response actions, the Working Paper could address, inter alia:
a) What criteria could be used to determine whether an impact causes harm to the environment;
b) What is the scientific meaning of "dependent and associated ecosystems";
c) What, in the circumstances of Antarctica, are incidents that could cause environmental harm, distinguishing immediate harm from gradual or cumulative harm;
d) Whether, and under what circumstances, would it be possible and/or practicable to take containment, mitigation or clean-up action, and whether, and under what circumstances, would it be possible to restore the environment; and
e) Is there an operational or scientific definition of the term "irreparable" and, if so, what criteria could be used to determine if harm is "irreparable".
Note the desirability of receiving comments from the CEP on the joint COMNAP/SCAR Working Paper.
Further request that the advice, referred to in paragraph 2, as well as reports of COMNAP on emergency risk assessment, be conveyed by the Chairman of the Meeting to representatives of the insurance industry, including the International Association of P&I Clubs, in order to seek their views regarding the insurability of operators and vessels for harm to the Antarctic environment, and what further scientific or practical information would be necessary for assessing the risks associated with operations in the Antarctic.
