RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTS OF THE
INTERSESSIONAL CONTACT GROUP CONVENORS
AND THE UNITED KINGDOM ON THE DRAFT
CZECH SCIENTIFIC STATION CEE

Madrid, 9/20 de junio 2003
Report of the CEP intersessional contact group
on the
Draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation for a
Czech Scientific Station in Antarctica
Convened by Australia.

1. Background

CEP Circular 1/2003 of 12 February advised CEP Contacts of the availability of a draft CEE
submitted by the Czech Republic. The document was posted to the CEP website.

CEP Circular 5/2003 (attached) of 3 April advised CEP Contacts of a request by New Zealand to
convene an intersessional contact group to consider the draft CEE. This Circular advised
members that, unless a member objected, the ICG work would commence on the suggested terms
of reference on 13 April.

The ICG commenced its work on April 14 convened by Mr Shaun Walsh, Operations
Environmental Advisor of the Australian Antarctic Division, and completed its draft report on
April 28.

2. Terms of Reference

New Zealand proposed the following terms of reference for the ICG, and as no requests were
received to modify them, they were adopted:

- The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I
of the Environmental Protocol.
- Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the
information contained within the document.
- The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.

3. Comments Received

Comments were received from New Zealand on the 24th April and Australia on the 28th April,
and are summarised in the left-hand column of the following pages.

4. Revised draft CEE.

The Czech Republic released a revised CEE on 28th April, however there was not sufficient time
before ATCM XXVI document deadlines for the ICG to reconsider its comments in light of the
new document.

Nonetheless, to assist CEP members to analyse the revised document, the ICG Convenor has
added his comments in the right-hand column as to whether the revised document appears to
address the ICG participants' original comments.

   main text would be useful;                 ·  Not addressed in revised CEE.

·  it may add clarity if the distinction 
   between outputs and impacts suggested in 
   the 1996 COMNAP Guidelines for 
   Environmental Impact Assessment in 
   Antarctica was utilised. No systematic 
   consideration of nature, extent, duration 
   and intensity is made explicit, although

CEP Circular: 5/2003

3 April 2003

Dear CEP Colleagues,

Intersessional Contact Groups: ANDRILL Program and Czech Scientific Station

1. ANDRILL Program.

Australia and SCAR will take part with New Zealand in an ICG to consider the draft CEE for the ANDRILL program, announced in CEP Circular 4/2003. The contact for New Zealand is Emma Waterhouse, and the contact for SCAR is Dr Peter Clarkson.

I have received no further nominations.

Australia has proposed Dr Ian Goodwin as convenor of the ICG. Dr Goodwin is Head of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Group at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales. He has a long association with Antarctic geoscience, particularly in relation to climate change research.

According to the CEP operational procedures CEP Members have until Friday 4 April to object or propose comments or suggestions concerning the proposed convenor and the proposed terms of reference.

Should I receive no such correspondence by that date, I will consider the matter agreed, and the ICG will commence its work immediately.

2. Czech Scientific Station.

I have received a request from New Zealand to constitute an ICG to consider the draft CEE for the Czech Scientific Station (James Ross Island). New Zealand has proposed the following terms of reference (these are the TOR suggested by the CEP Operational Procedures):

- The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.

- Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document.

                                                                                              10
Report of the Intersessional Contact Group convened by Australia to consider the draft CEE on the Czech Scientific Station in Antarctica, submitted by the Czech Republic.

- The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.

Paragraph 6 of the Operational Procedures provides for a time limit of 15 days for Parties to "object or offer comments, suggestions or proposals", however the deadline for submission of Working Papers to the ATCM Secretariat is April 25. This is extremely tight. I therefore propose that we allow only ten (10) days for comment, and that the ICG commence its work on 13 April.

Would Parties therefore please advise me as a priority by 13 April:

1. Whether you agree to the shortened comment period

2. Whether you wish to participate in the ICG

3. If you wish to participate, whether you are happy with the suggested TOR.

4. Nominations or suggestions of a convenor for this ICG.

I wish you well in your preparations for CEP VI.

Best wishes,

Tony Press
