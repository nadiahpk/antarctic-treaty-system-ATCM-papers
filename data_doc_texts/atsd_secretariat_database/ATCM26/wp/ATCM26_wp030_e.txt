Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 120, Geology Point archipelago


Jean Rostand, ALEXIS CARREL Le Mauguen (former Alexis Carrel), Lamarck and Claude Bernard Islands, The Good Doctor’s Nunatak and Breeding Site of Emperor Penguins


UPDATED MANAGEMENT PLAN

Annex V of the Madrid Protocol adopted in Bonn during the XVI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is now in force (Law No. 2003-347 dated April 15, 2003, regarding environmental protection in Antarctica). The development of the legal framework calls for a revision of the management plan for Geology Poing Archipelago in Terre Adélie, an «Antarctic Specially Protected Area». In accordance with Article 6-3 of Annex V to the Protocol, the Management Plan must indeed be reexamined at least every five years and updated as the need may arise. The contents of the plan has been restructured in accordance with the provisions of Article 5-3.

1.	Description of Values to be Protected

	In 1995, four islands, a nunatak and the breeding ground of emperor penguins were classified as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (Measure 3, Seoul ATCM) because they constituted a representative example of terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems from a biological, geological and aesthetic perspective. A species of marine mammal, the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) and various species of birds breed in the area: emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri); Antarctic skua (Catharacta maccormicki); Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis Adeliae adeliae); Wilson’s Petrel  (Oceanites oceanicus); giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteus); Snow petrel (Pagodrama nivea), Cape petrel (Daption capense).

	Well-marked escarpments display asymmetrical transverse profiles with gently dipping northern slopes and steeper southern ones. Numerous faults and fractures provide for very rough terrain. The basement rocks mainly consist of sillimanite, cordierite and garnet-rich gneisses crossed over by abundant dikes of pink anatexites. The lowest parts of the islands are covered by morainic boulders (from a few centimetres to more than a metre across). 

	Sustained research and monitoring programs of birds and marine mammals have been pursued for a long time (since 1952 or 1964 depending on the species). A database started in 1981 is managed by the Centre d’Etudes biologiques de Chize (CEBC-CNRS). Human scientific presence is of the order of 4 people for a few hours, twice a month in the protected area.

	Of the 30 odd emperor penguin breeding sites on record, this is the only one located close to a permanent station. It is therefore a privileged spot for the study of this species and its environment.

2.	Aims and Objectives 

	Management of the Pointe-Géologie Specially Protected Area aims at: 

    • preventing disturbance in the area due to the proximity of the station;
    • preventing disturbance in the area due to the growing number of cruising ships: 335 tourists landed at Dumont d’Urville station over the past 5 years; 
    • allowing research of a compelling scientific nature which cannot be carried out elsewhere; 
    • avoiding any significant change to the structure and composition of flora and fauna and to the combination of the various species of vertebrates living in the area, which is one of the most representative on Adélie coast on account of its fauna and scientific significance ; 
    • promoting scientific research in marine and terrestrial biology : ethology, ecology, physiology and biochemistry, especially those related to monitoring of populations and impact assessment of anthropogenic activities, including tourism;
    • allowing for research programmes in geology, with particular attention paid to the scheduling of visits when thermomechanical sampling tools are used. 

3.	Management Activities 

	The Plan is periodically reviewed to ensure proper monitoring of protection measures applicable to the values of this Antarctic Specially Protected Area. Any activity carried out in the area is preceded by an environmental impact assessment. 

4.	Period of Designation 

	The Area remains an Antarctic Specially Protected Area for an indefinite period. 

5.	Description of the Area and Identification of Sectors

(i)	Geographic coordinates, boundary markers and natural features 

	The Jean Rostand, Le Mauguen (formerly Alexis Carrel), Lamarck and Claude Bernard islands, the ‘Bon Docteur’ Nunatak and the Emperor penguins breeding colony are located at the centre of Pointe-Géologie Archipelago, on the coastal area of Adélie Land (140° ‑ 140°02'E - 66°39'30" - 66°40'30"S;).

	The area consists of the southernmost rock outcrops of Pointe-Géologie Archipelago, between Petrel Island and the western edge of Astrolabe Glacier. It is an extended ice-free area on Terre Adélie.

	Overall, the area of rock outcrops does not exceed 2 km2. The highest points are distributed along north-east-south-west ridges (C. Bernard Island: 47.6 m; J Rostand Island 36.39 m; Le Mauguen (formerly Alexis Carrel) Island: 28.24 m Nunatak: 28.50 m). 

	During summer, only the Southern flanks of the islands remain covered by firns. 

	The area has clear natural boundary markers. However, markers will be put in place in the Nunatak at a later stage. 

	There are no tracks or roads within the area. 

(ii)	Identification of restricted or prohibited zones 

	Access to any part of the area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by a permit. 

	The location of breeding colonies is shown on the map. Birds are present from October to March, but for the emperor penguins, which breed in winter (Table 2). Their sensitivity to human disturbances varies by species (Table 3). The establishment of the Dumont d'Urville station resulted in a drastic drop in the populations of emperor penguins and southern giant petrels in Pointe-Géologie Archipelago. However, the significant decrease of emperor penguins towards the end of the 1970s seems to result from prolonged climate anomalies between 1976 and 1982. Since 1995, the breeding areas of these two species are protected and the populations are now stable (Table 3). No one, except permit holders, is authorized to approach or disturb the Emperor penguin colony in any way during the breeding season, from April to mid-December when the chicks fledge. 

	The particularly sensitive Emperor penguins should also be protected beyond the boundaries of the defined breeding area as the colony is not always located at the same spot. 

	The south-eastern part of Jean Rostand Island is designated as a restricted area in order to preserve the remaining breeding colony of Southern giant petrels. Access to this restricted area is strictly prohibited during the breeding period, from August to February. Access is restricted to one ornithologist holding a permit to the extent spelled out in the present paragraph, i.e. once a year when chicks are being banded, for the purposes of population monitoring. The boundary of the restricted area is defined by the NE-SW ridge going through the 33.10 m and 36.39 m marks North West of the colony, marked on the ground with stakes. This situation shall be applicable for an indefinite period, but may be reviewed whenever the Management Plan is reviewed. 

(iii)	Structures  within  the Area 

	Provost historical hut and a shelter are located on Rostand Island. There are no other structures in the Area.

7.	Conditions Under Which Permits May Be Granted 

	The Council of State approves a Decree appointing the competent authority in charge of granting such a permit.

	Permits may be granted to carry out several scientific, monitoring or site inspection activities entailing the taking of biological materials or fauna in small quantities. Permits specify for each entry and stay the scope of the tasks, their duration and the maximum staff authorized to enter the Area.

(i)	Access to and movement within the Area 

	Helicopters and terrestrial vehicles are not authorized to access to or travel within the Area. Overflights of the Area by helicopters or planes are prohibited. The area can therefore only be accessed on foot or by zodiacs (in summer). However, departures of terrestrial vehicles from Bon Docteur Nunatak may exceptionally be allowed, only when sea-ice conditions make it impossible to proceed otherwise and with special attention to birds in the area. Access to the Area is strictly limited to ornithologists holding  a permit and to the two or three persons accompanying them for obvious security reasons. Access to and movement within the area shall in all cases proceed with the utmost care so as to avoid disturbing  the birds, especially when crossing their pathways. Under no circumstances should breeding areas or access thereto be degraded. 

(ii)	Activities that are or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place

    • compelling scientific activities which cannot be conducted elsewhere and essential management activities, provided special care is provided for both the emperor penguins and the restricted area Southern giant petrels (see para 6.ii).
    • visitors granted access to the Area by a permit shall ensure that their visit will cause no disturbances to the monitoring programs under way. 

(iii)	Installation, modification or removal of structures 

	No structures are to be erected or scientific equipment installed in the area except for compelling scientific reasons or management activities as authorized by the competent authorities in accordance with the urbanistic and domaniality regulations in force. 

(iv)	The location of field camps 

	Camps may only be erected when security reasons so require provided all precautions are taken to avoid damaging or disturbing the fauna. 

(v)	Restriction on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area 

    • according to the provisions set forth in Annex II of the Madrid Protocol, no living animals or plant materials, poultry products, including dried eggs, shall be introduced into the Area; 
    • no chemicals shall be brought into the Area, except chemicals which may be introduced for a compelling scientific purpose as specified in the permit. Any chemical introduced shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the permit was granted; 
    • fuel, food and other materials are not to be stored in the area, unless required for compelling purposes connected with the activity for which the permit has been granted. Such materials are to be removed when no longer required. Permanent storage is not permitted. 

(vi)	The taking of or harmful interference with flora and fauna 

	Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna is prohibited except in accordance with a permit. If an activity is determined as having less than a minor or transitory impact, it should be carried out in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica, as a minimum standard. When an activity has more than a minor or transitory impact, an environmental impact assessment procedure should be implemented.

(vii)	The collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the permit holder 

	Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by a permit holder is prohibited unless specified in the permit for scientific or management purposes. 

	However, debris of manmade origin may be removed from the area and dead or pathological specimens of fauna or flora may be removed for laboratory examination. 

(viii)	The disposal of waste 

	All non-human wastes produced on site shall be removed from the Area. 

(ix)	Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met 

	Visits to the Area shall be restricted to scientific and management objectives only. 

(x)	Requirements for reports of visits to the Area 

	Parties should ensure that the principal holder of each permit issued submit to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR. Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the management plan. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit original or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both in any review of the management plan and in organizing the scientific use of the Area.
