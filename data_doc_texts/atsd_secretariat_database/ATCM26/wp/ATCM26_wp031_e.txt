Working Paper 
New Zealand


Introduction

In accordance with the provisions Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Resolution 1 (1998), New Zealand has initiated a review of the management plans for the following Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs):

    • ASPA 105, Beaufort Island, Ross Sea (previously SPA 5)
    • ASPA 131, Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Victoria Land (previously SSSI 12)
    • ASPA 154, Botany Bay, Cape Geology, Victoria Land (previously SSSI 37)
    • ASPA 155, Cape Evans, Ross Island (previously SPA 25)
    • ASPA 156, Lewis Bay, Mount Erebus (previously SPA 26)

These ASPAs have been renamed and renumbered from previous Specially Protected Area and Site of Special Scientific Interest designations in accordance with Decision 1 (2002).

The review processes for three of the ASPAs (105, 154 and 156) have been completed and are described in this paper. Draft revised plans for these Areas are annexed to Attachment 4, a draft Measure.

The review process for ASPAs 155 and 131 revealed more complex issues and will be continued.


ASPA 105, Beaufort Island, Ross Sea

Introduction

Beaufort Island is protected for its penguin and skua colonies and significant vegetation. The area is one of the most important breeding grounds in the region for the birds, and because of its isolation the ecosystem is a potential reference site. Fast ice attached to the island is also included in the Area’s boundaries to protect breeding Emperor penguins there. The area was first designated in 1966 (Resolution IV-5) as Specially Protected Area No. 5 and the management plan was last revised in 1997 (Measure XXI-1).

Review of Activities

In the period since the last revision of the management plan for ASPA 105, the United States has issued three permits to enter the Area and New Zealand has issued eight.  Research conducted in this Area has been varied with studies carried out on Adélie penguin populations, geology, and Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity.  


A recent review on literature suggests that the ecological values in the Area remain significant and unique.  The avifauna is substantial and the Area is considered one of the most important breeding grounds in the region.  The Adélie penguin colony population has been increasing in this Area, which is the closest colony to the ice edge, perhaps due to the harsh conditions faced by Adélie penguins at some of the other colonies in the region. 

No significant management activity has been undertaken for this Area.  This level of activity is considered appropriate due to the low use of the Area over this period and the sensitivity of some areas to visitation.  The continued low levels of shipping in the region combined with the isolation of Beaufort Island makes the installation of boundary markers and signs unnecessary.

Consultation with the Science Community

New Zealand researchers known to have worked in the Area since its designation were contacted to gauge whether information in the management plan was still current and whether the values identified had changed since the last revision.  In general, the values of the Area were considered more than sufficient to warrant protection.

ASPA 154, Botany Bay, Cape Geology

Introduction

Botany Bay contains rich and diverse lichen and moss communities at high latitude and abundant algae, invertebrate and South polar skua populations. In addition to biological values, the Area protects a rock shelter constructed by the 1910-1913 British Antarctic Expedition within a special Managed Zone. It was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 37 in 1997 (Measure XXI-3).

Review of Activities

New Zealand has issued 25 permits in the period since the last revision of the management plan for ASPA 154.  The United States has not issued any permits for entry to this Area.  Research conducted in this Area has been wide and varied including studies on the biodiversity and performance of lichens and mosses, impacts of humans on Antarctic soils including research into fuel spills, terrestrial diversity, genetic variation in Antarctic mosses, the ecology of terrestrial fauna, and the microbiology of terrestrial biotopes.  The Antarctic Heritage Trust conducted a site visit to the Area in the 2002/03 season and removed the sledge remains from the Managed Zone for conservation reasons.  

The limited geographical extent of the ecosystem, its unusual ecological features and importance, its exceptional scientific and historic values verify the need for on-going long-term protection of this Area.    

No significant management activity has been undertaken in the Area.      

Consultation with the Science Community

New Zealand researchers known to have worked in the Area since its designation were contacted to gauge whether information in the management plan was still current and whether the values identified had changed since the last revision.  In general, the values of the Area were considered more than sufficient to continue protection of the Area.  

Proposed Revision
The management plan text has been modified slightly.  
The section, 7(ix) Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met, has been slightly modified and a more detailed description of the measures to be taken have been added
The sledge remains are no longer shown in the Managed Area (Map C) as the Antarctic Heritage Trust has removed them for conservation purposes.  All of the maps have been updated to reflect the new naming and numbering system under Annex V.   
A bibliography of relevant literature (see below) has also been added to the management plan.

ASPA 156, Lewis Bay, Mt Erebus

Introduction

Lewis Bay was the site of a DC-10 aircraft crash resulting in 257 fatalities in 1979. Despite the best efforts of recovery teams, not all the bodies of those who died could recovered and the site was declared a tomb in 1981. A Specially Protected Area designation (No. 27) was made in 1997 (Measure XXI-2) to ensure the area remains one of peace and remembrance.

Review Process

Because the site is a tomb, its values are enduring. Only one known entry to the Area has been made since its designation, this being a commemorative service marking the 20th anniversary of the crash in 1999.  Relevant staff in the New Zealand and United States national Antarctic programmes were consulted with regard to any operational problems the designation may have caused. No concerns were raised.

Conclusion

Given the enduring nature of the values in this Area and the absence of any other concerns regarding this Area, no substantive changes to the text of plan are proposed. The only revisions in the annexed version are therefore the renaming and renumbering of all ASPAs referred to, and an improved copy of figure 1.





















Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 105

BEAUFORT ISLAND, McMURDO SOUND, ROSS SEA

1.	Description of values to be protected
Beaufort Island was originally designated in Recommendation IV-5 (1966, as Specially Protected Area No. 5) after a proposal by New Zealand on the grounds that it “contains substantial and varied avifauna, that it is one of the most important breeding grounds in the region, and that it should be protected to preserve the natural ecological system as a reference area”. The Area has been set aside primarily to protect the site’s ecological values and these reasons for long-term special protection still apply.

The island comprises a variety of terrain and habitats: gently sloping ice-free ground with summer ponds and small meltwater streams draining to the coast; moderately sloping ice fields covering much of the west side of the island; and steep, rugged cliffs on the eastern slopes.  Recent investigations indicate the avifauna is not as varied as first thought, but there exists a large Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony, a small breeding colony of Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), and several breeding colonies of South polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). The boundaries of the Area, which previously excluded the Emperor colony, have been extended to include fast-ice occupied by breeding birds.

Site visits in January 1995 and 1997 discovered and described a significant area of vegetation previously unrecorded on an ice-cored moraine bench of up to 50 m wide and 5–7 metres above the beach on the north of the island.  The vegetation is exceptional both in its quantity and quality, and is the most extensive, continuous area of mosses yet known for the McMurdo Sound region. Although the area is extensive (approximately 2.5 ha), the moss community is dominated by a single species, Bryum argenteum: the essentially monospecific character of the site is also unique. The site enjoys warm summer temperatures because of its northerly aspect and shelter from southerly winds by high ice cliffs. The local microclimate, stability of the substrate and supply of water from the nearby ice-cliffs and snow banks are favourable for vegetation growth.  As a result there is also a diverse community of algae, and while a detailed algal survey has not yet been undertaken, Prasiola crispa is particularly abundant throughout the site, together with a number of unicellular chlorophytes and xanthophytes (including Botrydiopsis and Pseudococcomyxa), and cyanobacteria (particularly scillatorians) mixed with the Prasiola.  Green snow algae, a mixture of Chloromonas and Klebsormidium, are present as well as the red snow algae Chlamydomonas sp., Chloromonas sp., and Chlamydomonas nivalis.  This represents one of the most southerly locations where red snow algae have been observed. The exceptional plant communities at this site are fragile and vulnerable to disturbance and destruction by trampling, sampling and/or through foreign introductions.  Conservation of the ecological and scientific values of this community are important reasons for special protection at Beaufort Island.
As an isolated island difficult of access, the site is known to have been visited only infrequently. Beaufort Island has not been comprehensively studied or documented but is largely undisturbed by direct human activity.  In particular, Beaufort Island has been exposed to fewer opportunities for direct exotic biological introductions than many other sites in the Ross Sea. The ecological, scientific and aesthetic values derived from the isolation and relatively low level of human impact are important reasons for special protection at Beaufort Island.

2.	Aims and objectives
Management at Beaufort Island aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance to the Area;
    • preserve the natural ecosystem as a reference area largely undisturbed by direct human activities;
    • allow scientific research on the natural ecosystems, plant communities, avifauna and soils in the Area provided it is for compelling reasons which cannot be served elsewhere;
    • minimise human disturbance to plant communities by preventing unnecessary sampling;
    • minimise the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the management plan.

3.	Management activities
The following management activities are to be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • A map showing the location of the Area (stating the special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently and copies of the Management Plan shall be made available at Scott Base (NZ).
    • Markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition, and removed when no longer necessary.
    • Visits shall be made as necessary to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.
    • National Antarctic Programmes operating in the region shall consult together with a view to ensuring these steps are carried out.

4.	Period of designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

6.	Description of the Area
6(i)  Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features
The designated Area encompasses the whole of Beaufort Island (76°59'S, 167°00'E Map A) above the mean high water mark, and includes adjacent fast-ice occupied by breeding Emperor penguins.  The 7 km by 3.2 km island rises to 771 m at Paton Peak. The west side of the island is predominantly an ice field with ice cliffs of about 20 m on the coast, while the east and south sides of the island are largely ice-free, with steep and inaccessible cliffs rising straight from the sea.  In view of the isolation of Beaufort Island and the current low levels of shipping activity in the region, boundary markers and signs have not been installed to mark the Area:  the need for marking should be re-evaluated at each management plan review.

Beaufort Island is one of a series of late Tertiary volcanic vents that developed along a line of weakness in the Ross Sea floor.  The geology is typical of an eroded, sub-aerially produced basaltic complex, with lava flows and explosion breccias and tuffs evident.  Many of the volcanic rocks have been intruded by a series of late stage basaltic dikes, and there is evidence of layered ash-fall tuffs and welded spatter flows from local subsidiary cinder and spatter cones. Cadwalader Beach comprises a beach foreland and cuspate spit, backed by steep basaltic cliffs and several talus cones.  A series of beach ridges, which are generally occupied by the breeding penguins, have trapped meltwater ponds and mark the growth of the beach face away from the cliffs with time.  A series of raised beaches is evident at the northeastern end of the island, some with evidence (quills and guano) of former and apparently substantial penguin colonies.  Sub-tidal (abrasion) platforms and massive boulders are found below the highly weathered eastern and southern cliffs.
An Adélie colony occupies the flat area at Cadwalader Beach (Map D).  The number of Adelie penguins breeding on Beaufort Island peaked at 53,733 pairs in 1986.  Since then the population has ranged from 23,512 breeding pairs (in 1998) to 45,768 (in 1987).  Above the steep cliffs that rise behind the colony, a population of skuas (numbers unknown) nest on more gentle ice-free slopes at the edge of the permanent ice field on the west flank of the island.  This ice field is punctuated mid-way by a 2 km line of rocky outcrops at an elevation of approximately 200 m.  In the north the ice field broadens into an extensive flat area of less than 50 m elevation, NE of which extends an ice-free beach about 1000 m in length and 50 m wide (Map C). In January 1995 a newly-established, possibly transitory, colony of Adélie penguins (comprising 2 pairs with 3 chicks and a approximately 10-15 non-breeders) occupied the west end of this beach.  Above the beach, a raised ice-cored moraine terrace (5–20 m elevation, ranging from 2-3 metres wide over most of its length but broadening to 20-50 metres at its eastern end) extends for 550 m before rising more steeply toward the unstable basaltic cliffs which persist around the entire eastern side of the island.  At least three sub-fossil penguin colony deposits have been identified within the moraine terrace, each layer vertically separated by around 50–100 cm of gravels and sand, suggesting this part of the island had been occupied by a sizable breeding penguin colony in the recent past.  The deposits may be useful for determining the age of former penguin colonies in the region.

A population of approximately 100 skuas (1995 count) breeds on the terrace and ice-free slopes leading toward the cliffs.  The proportion of breeders to non-breeders in this population is not known, but approximately 25 and 50 chicks were counted in January 1995 and 1997 respectively.

On the fast-ice adjacent to the northern coastal reaches, a small colony of breeding Emperor penguins (1787 pairs at 1976 count; 179 pairs at 1983 count, 1355 adults at October 1994 count) is present annually between the months of approximately April to January. The size of the colony is limited by the areal extent and condition of the fast-ice, which affects the availability of breeding sites in the lee of the northern slopes of Beaufort Island. The precise location of the colony varies from year to year and the colony moves within a breeding season, but the general area of occupation is indicated on Map C.

The ice-free moraine terrace on the north end of the island (Map C) also supports the richest growth of vegetation recorded on Beaufort Island.  This vegetation is exceptional both in quantity and quality, and is the most extensive, continuous area of mosses yet known for the McMurdo Sound region.  The site enjoys warm summer temperatures (an air temperature +13°C was recorded on 18 January 1997) because of its northerly aspect and shelter from southerly winds by a 20 m high semi-circular ice cliff. The local microclimate, stability of the ground surface and supply of water from the nearby ice-cliffs and snow banks are favourable for vegetation growth. Initially the water forms a diffuse flush but becomes progressively entrained into rivulets that have eroded narrow valleys in the edge of the terrace.  The moss community is extensive (approximately 2.5 ha), with much of the site showing 100% ground cover, dominated by a single species, Bryum argenteum.  One specimen of another species, Pottia heimii, was found after an extensive search: the essentially monospecific character of the site is also unique. The Bryum occurs in scattered patches at the upper (southern) margin of the bench, adjacent to the annual drift snow at the base of the ice cliff, and more continuous mats (hummocks) occur in the middle of the bench and in areas where spreading water drainage occurs, especially at the eastern end. In the upper (southern) part of the area the Bryum is intermixed with Nostoc colonies (cyanobacterium).  At lower and more northerly sites in areas of high water flow the moss may be overgrown with a brown coloured mixed cyanobacterial community, particularly in areas prone to flooding, cryoturbic disturbance and, possibly, skua activity. Bryum argenteum produces dehiscent shoot tips which disperse the plants down stream.  Evidence of this dispersal was commonly seen with B. argenteum sometimes occurring as small, and probably ephemeral, communities on the beach below the terrace. The moss community is known to support significant populations of mites, but a detailed survey of invertebrates on Beaufort Island has yet to be undertaken.

The vegetation at Beaufort Island is comparable to the upper, wetter parts of the flush at Canada Glacier (ASPA 131), Taylor Valley, Victoria Land.  The Canada Glacier flush has a common, second species, Pottia heimii, that grows in drier areas but this was almost completely absent at Beaufort Island.  The reason for this is unknown, but could be due to substrate differences, the presence of numerous skuas occupying the drier areas at Beaufort Island, high nutrient levels in the melt water at Beaufort Island, or limited dispersal and colonisation opportunities.  At Botany Bay (ASPA 154), Granite Harbour, Victoria Land — a warmer site than at Canada Glacier but at a similar latitude to Beaufort Island — the wetter areas are occupied by the moss Ceratodon purpureus  or Bryum argenteum, so that there may be a sequence from wet to dry of C. purpureus - B. argenteum - P. heimii.  While there is no understanding as to why C. purpureus is absent at Beaufort Island it is likely that limited dispersal and colonisation opportunities, as well as water nutrient status, may be important.

There is also a diverse community of algae, and while a detailed algal survey has not yet been undertaken, Prasiola crispa is particularly abundant throughout the site, reflecting the high nutrient status and abundance of melt water.  A number of unicellular chlorophytes and xanthophytes (including Botrydiopsis and Pseudococcomyxa) and cyanobacteria (particularly scillatorians) were found mixed with the Prasiola. Green snow algae, noticeable as a green band at the lower levels of snow banks above the beach and below the ice cliffs, contained a mixture of Chloromonas and Klebsormidium.  The snow and ice cliffs forming the upper edge of the beach also contain a pinkish-brown deposit, consisting largely of fine silty material as well as the red snow algae Chlamydomonas sp., Chloromonas sp., and Chlamydomonas nivalis. This represents one of the most southerly locations where red snow algae have been observed.

During a NZ/US visit in January 1995 abandoned equipment was removed from among the Adélie colony at Cadwalader Beach.  No other human impact was visually evident in 1995.

6(ii)  Restricted zones within the Area
None.

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
The only structure known to exist on the island is a signpost on a prominent rock in the Adélie colony at Cadwalader Beach (Map D).  The sign, erected in 1959–60, bears the names and home-towns of seamen and the Captain of the HMNZS Endeavour:  the sign is set in concrete and was in good condition in January 1995.  The sign is of potential historic value and should remain in situ unless there are compelling reasons for its removal, which should be kept under review.

An astronomical survey station is recorded on a map of the island compiled in 1960, but it is unknown whether any associated permanent marker exists.  The station is recorded as located at the south end of the main island ridge-line divide at an altitude of 549 m (Map A).

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within close proximity of the Area
The nearest protected area to Beaufort Island is New College Valley ASPA 20 located 35 km to the south at Cape Bird, Ross Island.  Cape Royds ASPAs 121 and 157 are a further 35 km to the south. (Refer to the inset: Map A).

7.	Permit conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by appropriate national authorities.  Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:
    • it is issued only for compelling scientific reasons that cannot be served elsewhere;
    • the actions permitted will not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the Area;
    • any management activities are in support of the aims of the Management Plan;
    • the actions permitted are in accordance with the Management Plan;
    • the Permit, or an authorized copy, shall be carried within the Area;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the authority named in the Permit;
    • permits shall be issued for a stated period. 

7(i)  Access to and movement within the Area
Land vehicles are prohibited within the Area and access shall be by small boat or by aircraft.  Aircraft should land on the island only at the designated site (166° 52' 31" E, 76° 55' 49" S: Maps A-C and Figure 1) on the large flat toe of ice on the north end of the island.  Should snow conditions at the designated landing site at the time of visit militate against a safe aircraft landing, a suitable mid- to late-season alternative to the designated landing site may be found at the nominated northern camp site at the western end of northern beach on Beaufort Island. It is preferred that aircraft approach and depart from the designated landing site from the south or west (Map A, Figure 1).  When it is found necessary to use the alternative site at the northern beach campsite, practical considerations may dictate a northern approach: when this is the case aircraft shall avoid overflight of the area east of this site indicated on Maps A–C and Figure 1.  Use of smoke grenades when landing within the Area is prohibited unless absolutely necessary for safety, and all grenades should be retrieved. There are no special restrictions on where access can be gained to the island by small boat.  Pilots, air or boat crew, or other people on aircraft or boats, are prohibited from moving on foot beyond the immediate vicinity of the landing site unless specifically authorised by a Permit.

Overflight of bird breeding areas lower than 750 m (or 2500 ft) is normally prohibited: the areas where these special restrictions apply are shown on Maps A–D and Figure 1.  When required for essential scientific or management purposes, transient overflight down to a minimum altitude of 300 m (1000 ft) may be allowed over these areas: conduct of such overflights must be specifically authorised by Permit.

Visitors should avoid unnecessary disturbance to birds, or walking on visible vegetation. Pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to minimise effects.

7(ii) Activities that are or may be conducted in the Area, including restrictions on time or place
    • Scientific research that will not jeopardise the ecosystem of the Area and which cannot be served elsewhere;
    • Essential management activities, including monitoring.

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
No scientific equipment or structures are to be erected within the Area except as specified in a Permit.  All markers, structures or scientific equipment installed in the Area must be approved by Permit and clearly identified by country, name of the principal investigator and year of installation.  All such items should be made of materials that pose minimal risk of contamination of the Area.  Removal of specific equipment for which the Permit has expired shall be a condition of the Permit.  

7(iv)  Location of field camps
Camping is permitted only at two designated sites (Maps A–D). The north camping site is located on the flat area north of the designated landing site, on a more sheltered location at the NW end of the beach, 200 m from where several pair of Adélie penguins and skuas nest (if present).  The second site is located on the snow 100 m from the northern edge of the large Adélie colony at Cadwalader Beach.

7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which can be brought into the Area
No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and the precautions listed in 7(ix) below shall be taken against accidental introductions.  No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area.  Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, which may be introduced for scientific or management purposes specified in the Permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.  Fuel is not to be stored in the Area, unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the Permit has been granted.  All materials introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction into the environment is minimised.  

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
Taking or interfering with flora or fauna is prohibited, except in accordance with a Permit issued under Article 3 of Annex II by the appropriate national authority specifically for that purpose.  Where animal taking or harmful interference is involved this should, as a minimum standard, be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica.

7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder
Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.  Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ : if this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified.

7(viii) Disposal of waste
All wastes, including all human wastes, shall be removed from the Area.

7(ix)  Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met
    1. Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and site inspection activities, which may involve the collection of small samples for analysis or review, or for protective measures.
    2. Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
    3. To help maintain the ecological and scientific values of the isolation and historically low level of human impact at Beaufort Island visitors shall take special precautions against introductions.  Of particular concern are microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils at other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica.  Visitors shall take the following measures to minimise the risk of introductions:
        a) Any sampling equipment or markers brought into the Area shall be sterilised and, to the maximum extent practicable, maintained in a sterile condition before being used within the Area.  To the maximum extent practicable, footwear and other equipment used or brought into the Area (including backpacks or carry-bags) shall be thoroughly cleaned or sterilised and maintained in this condition before entering the Area;
        b) Sterilisation should be by an acceptable method, such as by UV light, autoclave or by washing exposed surfaces in 70% ethanol solution in water.

7(x)  Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal holder for each permit issued submit to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken.  Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR.  Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Management Plan.  Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both in any review of the management plan and in organising the scientific use of the Area.

Management Plan for 
Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 156

LEWIS BAY, MOUNT EREBUS, ROSS ISLAND

1.	Description of values to be protected
An area on the lower slopes of Mount Erebus, above Lewis Bay on the north side of Ross Island, was originally declared a tomb in Recommendation XI-3 (1981) after notification by New Zealand that 257 people of several nationalities lost their lives when the DC-10 aircraft in which they were travelling crashed at this site on 28 November 1979.  In spite of the determined and courageous actions of the New Zealand and United States Antarctic expeditions the bodies of some of those who died could not be recovered.  Expressing deep sympathy with the relatives of those who died and with the Government and people of New Zealand, the tomb was declared in order to ensure that the area be left in peace.  These reasons for special protection are still valid, and the Area is to be kept inviolate as a mark of respect, in remembrance and in order to protect the site’s emotional values.
In late 1979 a six-foot oregon timber cross was erected close to the crash site as a memorial to those who lost their lives.  After damage by wind this cross was replaced on 30 January 1987 with a cross of stainless steel, located on a rocky promontory overlooking and approximately 3 km from the site. This site is not part of the protected area, but is proposed as an Historic Monument in recognition of the commemorative and symbolic values of the cross.

2.	Aims and objectives
Management at Lewis Bay aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area;
    • ensure the crash site is kept inviolate and prevent unnecessary human disturbance to the Area;
    • allow visits to the nearby site of the memorial cross for the purposes of commemoration or to pay respects;
    • allow visits for purposes in support of the aims of the management plan.

3.	Management activities
The following management activities are to be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • All pilots operating in the region shall be informed of the location, boundaries and restrictions applying to entry and over-flight in the Area;
    • Visits shall be made as necessary (no less than once every five years) for inspection and to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated;
    • National Antarctic Programmes operating in the region shall consult together with a view to ensuring these steps are carried out.

4.	Period of designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

5.	Maps and photographs
Map A:	Lewis Bay protected area topographic map. Note: Map A is derived from the Antarctic Digital Database (ADD) Version 1.0, 1993, which was prepared to a base scale of 1:250,000 under the auspices of SCAR.  Positional corrections have been applied to the ADD source data using 1993 and 1995 Global Positioning System (GPS) data and 1993 aerial photography.  Accuracy of the map remains approximate pending publication of new and accurate Ross Island maps at 1:50,000 scale.  The geographical coordinates of the crash site and other features are considered accurate to within approximately 100–200 m horizontally.  Elevation data are considered accurate to approximately 100 m vertically.

6.	Description of the Area
6(i)  Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features
The designated Area on Ross Island (Map A) encompasses the crash zone (centered on 167° 28' 30"E, 77° 25' 29"S, elevation 520 m (1720 feet)) and the surrounding glacial ice 2 km above and to either side of this position, extends as a 4 km wide ‘rectangle’ down to the sea, and includes the airspace above this region to an altitude of 1000 m (3280 feet) with the exception of a 200 m wide air access ‘corridor’ along the coastline. The west boundary of the Area is the 167° 23' 33"E meridian; the east boundary is the 167° 33' 27"E meridian.  The south boundary is the 77° 26' 33"S parallel, while the north boundary is defined by the coastline.  The aircraft’s primary impact occurred at an elevation of 446.7 m: debris was spread up-slope 570 m from that point over an area 120 m wide to an elevation of 580 m (1900 feet).  Much of the aircraft wreckage is now buried in ice and is slowly moving down-slope with the glacier to the sea (Figure 1). The bodies of some of those who died could not be recovered and remain in the Area.  Boundary markers have not been placed to mark the Area for two reasons: their presence is considered detrimental to the inviolate values of the site, and their maintenance would be impractical on the moving glacier.

6(ii)  Restricted zones within the Area
None.

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
The stainless steel memorial cross (proposed as a Historic Monument) is located on a rock outcrop  (167° 33' 43"E, 77° 26' 38"S; elevation  810 m (2660 feet)) approximately 3 km SE of the crash site, and is a symbol of the special significance of the Area.  No other structures exist within or near the Area.  Debris from the aircraft remains in situ.

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within close proximity of the Area
The nearest protected area to Lewis Bay is ASPA 130 at Tramway Ridge (15 km distant) near the summit of Mt. Erebus.  New College Valley ASPA 116 (at Cape Bird) and Cape Royds ASPA 121 are approximately 35 km west on Ross Island.  Cape Crozier ASPA 125 is 40 km to the east. (Refer to inset:  Map A).

7.	Permit conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by appropriate national authorities.  Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:
    • it is issued only for compelling purposes that are in support of the aims of the Management Plan;
    • the actions permitted will not compromise the values of the Area;
    • the actions permitted are in accordance with the Management Plan;
    • the Permit, or an authorized copy, shall be carried within the Area;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the authority named in the Permit;
    • permits shall be issued for a stated period.

7(i)  Access to and movement within the Area
Land vehicles are prohibited within the Area and access shall be by foot or by helicopter. Overflight of the Area is prohibited below 1000 m (3280 feet) above sea level, except for essential access related to the values for which this site is protected, or for inspection and monitoring of the site (at least once every five years).  An exception to the overflight restriction is provided by a 200 m wide access ‘corridor’ through the area immediately adjacent to the coastline (Map A), which allows transit of aircraft through the Area at times when visibility or conditions make avoidance of the Area otherwise impractical.  No special restrictions apply to the air routes used to move to and from the Area by helicopter when access is permitted.  Use of helicopter smoke grenades within the Area is prohibited unless absolutely necessary for safety, and then these should be retrieved.

7(ii) Activities that are or may be conducted in the Area, including restrictions on time or place
All visits to the Area for any purpose shall be made recognising the principal values to be protected in the Area, and as far as possible the Area should be left in peace.  Visits may be made for essential inspection to ensure the values of the Area are being maintained, and to determine if materials at the site present a problem by emergence from the ice and then possible wind dispersal, or for securing or removal of such items.  Visits may also be made for removal of materials introduced into the Area subsequent to its designation, if appropriate.

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
No structures are to be erected within the Area except as specified in a Permit.  It is prohibited to modify or remove any structure that was present within the Area at the time of special protection designation.

7(iv)  Location of field camps
Camping is prohibited within the Area, unless under exceptional circumstances for management or protection.  Where camping is required for such activities, the site selected shall be no closer than 200 m from the location of the wreckage at the time of the visit.

7(v) Restrictions on materials which can be brought into the Area
It is prohibited to introduce any materials into the Area.  Smoke grenades used when absolutely necessary for safety of air operations should be retrieved.

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited within the Area.

7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder
Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder is prohibited, unless it has been determined that materials at the site are emerging from the ice and their dispersal by wind presents a management problem.  If this is the case, such materials should be appropriately disposed of with due regard to the families of victims and according to national procedures.  Materials introduced into the Area subsequent to designation may be removed unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ : if this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified.

7(viii) Disposal of waste
It is prohibited to dispose of any waste, including all human wastes, within the Area.

7(ix)  Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met
None specified.
7(x)  Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal holder for each permit issued submit to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken.  Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR.  Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Management Plan.  Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage to be used in any review of the management plan.






















Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 154

BOTANY BAY, CAPE GEOLOGY, VICTORIA LAND

1.	Description of values to be protected
The Area at Botany Bay and Cape Geology (Granite Harbour, Victoria Land) has been proposed by New Zealand on the grounds that it is an extremely rich botanical refuge for such a high latitude location (162° 34' 00"E, 77° 00' 30"S), with a lichen and moss species diversity and abundance that is unique for southern Victoria Land.  In addition to a high diversity and abundance of lichens and mosses there are abundant growths of algae, large populations of invertebrates (collembola, mites, nematodes, rotifers) and a colony (in excess of 40 pairs) of South polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). The area is the type locality for the collembolan Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni Carpenter.

The structure and development of the moss and lichen communities is similar to that found more than 10° of latitude further north, with several species at their known southern limit.  The Area contains the most southerly record of an hepatic (Cephaloziella exiliflora). Of great significance is the size (up to 15 cm diameter) of some lichen thalli (e.g. Umbilicaria aprina).  The boulder beach has rich populations of both epilithic and endolithic lichens.

In addition to the biological values described, the Area contains within it the remains of a rock shelter and associated artifacts of historical importance, known as ‘Granite House’, designated as Historic Site No. 67 in Measure 4 (1995).  Constructed by members of the 1910-1913 British Antarctic Expedition, the shelter and associated artifacts are vulnerable to disturbance and are therefore managed as a Managed Zone within the Area, which is subject to access restrictions. 

The limited geographical extent of the ecosystem, its unusual ecological features and importance, its exceptional scientific and historic values and the vulnerability of the Area to disturbance through trampling, sampling, pollution or alien introductions, are such that the Area requires long-term special protection.

2.	Aims and objectives
Management at Cape Geology aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance to the Area;
    • allow scientific research on the ecosystem and elements of the ecosystem in particular on lichen and moss species, algae, invertebrates and skuas while ensuring protection from over-sampling;
    • allow other scientific research provided it is for compelling reasons which cannot be served elsewhere;
    • preserve a part of the natural ecosystem as a reference area for the purpose of future comparative studies;
    • minimise the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;
    • allow visits to ‘Granite House’, but under strict control by Permit;
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the management plan.

3.	Management activities
The following management activities are to be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • Maps showing the location of the Area (stating the special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and copies of this Management Plan shall be kept  in all of the research hut facilities located within 25 km of the Area.  Copies of the Management Plan will also be available at Scott Base (NZ).
    • Signs illustrating the location, boundaries and clearly stating entry restrictions shall be placed at appropriate locations at the boundaries of the Area and Zones within to help avoid inadvertent entry.
    • Markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition.
    • Visits shall be made as necessary (no less than once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.
    • National Antarctic Programmes operating in the region shall consult together with a view to ensuring these steps are carried out.

4.	Period of designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

6.	Description of the Area
6(i)  Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features
Cape Geology is situated in the south-western corner of Granite Harbour, southern Victoria Land, at 162°32'52"E, 77°00'14"S, approximately 100 km north-west of Ross Island (Map A, Insets).  The Area encompasses much of the catchment above Botany Bay and consists of raised boulder beach terraces, weathered rocky steppes and irregular rock platforms around Cape Geology, extending south to include a well-defined elevated cirque containing a small ice field.  The bedrock geology at Cape Geology has been described as a porphyritic grey biotite-granite, with phenocrysts of orthoclase of reddish colour, casting the weathered rock with a reddish tinge.

The northwest corner of the Area is marked by a brass plaque in a boulder (M1, 2 m: Maps A and B) 400 m SW of Cape Geology.  The west boundary is defined by a line extending first 260 m SSE from M1 to a large boulder (marked by a cairn) with terrier bolt (M2) at an elevation of 118 m on the ridge above the campsite; thence the boundary extends 250 m up this ridge to a point at 162 m elevation marked by an iron tube with bamboo pole.  The west boundary extends a further 300 m up this ridge to a large pointed rock at 255 m elevation near the edge of the permanent ice field.  The boundary then extends 150 m south across the ice field to the west edge of a prominent line of exposed rock and moraine in the SW corner of the Area at 325 m elevation.  The south boundary follows this line of rock east until the exposure is buried by the ice-field, thence SE across the ice field for 500 m to the edge of a second and more prominent exposure at an elevation of just over 400 m (M3).  The boundary follows the upper edge of this exposure and then crosses the ice field SE to an elevation of approximately 325 m where the ice-free eastern boundary ridge and the ice field converge.  The east boundary follows the ridge crest for 1550 m in a NE direction to a large pointed rock on the ridge (M4, 392 m) where the east boundary turns to descend due north to the coast at the eastern extremity of the boulder beach of Botany Bay (M5, 5 m). The mean high water mark of the coastline of Botany Bay and Cape Geology forms the northern boundary of the Area.
The Area is extremely rich botanically for such a high-latitude location — it is also one of the richest sites in the whole of continental Antarctica.  There is a high diversity and abundance of lichens (more than 30 species) and mosses (eight species), and the structure and development of these communities are similar to those found 10° of latitude further north.  Some lichen thalli (e.g. Umbilicaria aprina)  measure up to 15 cm diameter. The boulder beach has rich populations of both epilithic and endolithic lichens. The Area contains by far the most southerly record of an hepatic (Cephaloziella exiliflora) and the mosses Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostre and possibly Ceratodon purpureus.  There are abundant growths of algae (at least 85 taxa), although the algal flora is not considered particularly unusual for the locality.

There are large populations of invertebrates (collembola, mites, nematodes, rotifers) and the area is the type locality for the collembolan Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni Carpenter.  There is a colony of between 40 – 50 breeding pairs (and numerous non-breeders) of the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki), which is approximately the same number present in 1911–12.  No other bird species are known to breed in the Cape Geology area.

6(ii)  Restricted and managed zones within the Area
Restricted Zone
An area directly above Botany Bay is designated a Restricted Zone in order to preserve part of the Area as a reference site for future comparative studies, while the remainder of the Area (which is similar in biology, features and character) is more generally available for research programmes and sample collection.  The west boundary of the Restricted Zone is defined by a line from a marker (iron tube in rock, 20 metres from mean high water mark, elevation 8 m) at the west side of Botany Bay (Map A), extending SW for 170 m up to a second iron tube marker on the crest of the adjacent ridge (87 m).  This boundary extends 100 m to a third iron tube and a cairn (98 m), thence 50 m to a large flat rock in the centre of the main flush (marked ‘1’ on Maps A and B).  The south boundary of the Restricted Zone extends from the flat rock in the flush in a straight line 820 m to the first of two prominent boulders closely adjacent to each other, approximately in the middle of the ice-free slopes above Botany Bay (marked ‘2’ on Maps A and B at 165 m).  The east boundary extends 300 m from there to a large rock at 135 m elevation, thence NE downslope to the NE boundary point (M5, 5 m).  The north boundary of the Restricted Zone is the mean high water mark of Botany Bay and is coincident with the north boundary of the Area.

Access to the Restricted Zone is allowed only for compelling scientific or management (such as inspection or review) purposes, which cannot be served elsewhere in the Area.

Managed Zone
Situated at the coast at the northernmost tip of Cape Geology, a Managed Zone is designated to protect historic artifacts and plant communities within this vicinity, yet also to allow access to the rock shelter known as ‘Granite House’, which was designated as Historic Site No. 67 in Measure 4 (1995). The Managed Zone is an enclave of approximately 100 m by 80 m that surrounds a rock ridge leading from the coast at Cape Geology to the old shelter.  The boundaries are marked on Map C, with the southern-most corner marked by a cairn on a prominent boulder overlooking the rock shelter.  The shelter was constructed by members of the 1910-1913 British Antarctic Expedition, and used between December 1911 and January 1912 while the party carried out geological and biological exploration in the vicinity.  The structure was built using a natural hollow in the rocks, with walls built up from granite boulders and a roof of seal skins: in January 2003 parts of the walls remained, but while several of the skins were present the roof had collapsed.  Access to the Managed Zone may be allowed by Permit, subject to the conditions of this management plan.

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
The only structures known to exist in the Area are ‘Granite House’, the boundary survey markers and signposts in appropriate locations.

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within close proximity of the Area
The nearest protected area to Cape Geology is ASPA 123 at Barwick Valley, 50 km distant in a SW direction in the Victoria Land Dry Valleys.

7.	Permit conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by appropriate national authorities.  Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:
    • outside of the Restricted and Managed Zones, it is issued only for scientific study of the ecosystem, or for compelling scientific reasons that cannot be served elsewhere, or for essential management purposes consistent with plan objectives such as inspection or review;
    • access to the Restricted Zone is allowed only for compelling scientific or management reasons that cannot be served elsewhere in the Area;
    • access to the Managed Zone may be permitted for scientific, management, historical, educational or recreational purposes;
    • the actions permitted will not jeopardise the ecological, scientific or historic values of the Area;
    • any management activities are in support of the objectives of the Management Plan;
    • the actions permitted are in accordance with the Management Plan;
    • the Permit, or an authorized copy, shall be carried within the Area;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the authority named in the Permit;
    • permits shall be issued for a stated period.

7(i)  Access to and movement within the Area
Vehicles are prohibited within the Area and access should be by foot.  Helicopters are normally prohibited from landing within the Area: there is a designated site 60 m outside of the Area (162° 31' 55"E, 77° 00' 19"S: Map A and Map B). Access to the landing site should be from the open water / sea ice to the north of the Area.  Overflight of the Area lower than 300 m (~1000 ft) above ground level is normally prohibited.  When required for essential scientific or management purposes, transient overflight or landing may be allowed: conduct of such anticipated overflights or landings must be specifically authorised by Permit.  Use of helicopter smoke grenades within the Area is prohibited unless necessary for safety, and all grenades should be retrieved.  All helicopter landing or overflight lower than 300 m AGL is prohibited within the Restricted Zone.

Access into the Area should preferably be from the recommended camping area along a preferred walking route 10–20 m from the coast, which is relatively devoid of vegetation. Visitors should avoid walking on visible vegetation, or unnecessary disturbance to bird populations. Care should be exercised walking in areas of moist ground, where foot traffic can easily damage sensitive soils, plant and algal communities, and degrade water quality: walk around such areas, on ice or rocky ground.  Pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum necessary consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to minimise effects.

Access to the Managed Zone should preferably be from the coast, following the ridge leading up to ‘Granite House’ (Map C).  An alternative route may be used from the west of the Managed Zone if sea-ice travel is unsafe (Maps A–C). Unless specifically authorised by Permit, visitors are prohibited from entering the historic shelter, and are limited to access and viewing from the rock ridge designated for access from the coast in order to prevent damage to the rich vegetation within the Managed Zone.  Visitors shall not venture south of ‘Granite House’, unless specifically authorised by Permit.  A maximum of 10 people is permitted to enter the Managed Zone at any one time, and a maximum of 5 people is allowed in the viewing area overlooking ‘Granite House’ at any one time (Map C).

7(ii) Activities that are or may be conducted in the Area, including restrictions on time or place
    • scientific research that will not jeopardise the ecosystem of the Area;
    • essential management activities, including monitoring;
    • limited visits to the Managed Zone for reasons other than science or management subject to the conditions described in this plan;
    • activities with the aim of preserving or protecting the historic resources within the Area.

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
No structures are to be erected within the Area except as specified in a Permit.  All scientific equipment installed in the Area must be authorised by Permit and clearly identified by country, name of the principal investigator and year of installation.  All such items should be made of materials that pose minimal risk of contamination of the Area.  Removal of specific equipment for which the Permit has expired shall a condition of the Permit.

7(iv)  Location of field camps
Camping within the Area is prohibited and should be at a site outside of the Area, 100 m from the NW corner (Map A), adjacent to the designated helicopter landing site. This camping site has been disturbed by previous activities and visitors should reoccupy these disturbed positions for tents and other facilities.

7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which can be brought into the Area
No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and precautions shall be taken against accidental introductions.  No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area.  Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, which may be introduced for scientific or management purposes specified in the Permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.  Fuel is not to be stored in the Area, unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the Permit has been granted.  All materials introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction into the environment is minimised.

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
This is prohibited, except in accordance with a Permit.  Where animal taking or harmful interference is involved this should, as a minimum standard, be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica.

7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder
Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.  Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ : if this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified.
Unless specifically authorised by Permit, visitors are prohibited from interfering with or attempting restoration of ‘Granite House’ in any way, or from handling, taking or damaging any artifacts found within the Managed Zone.  Evidence of recent changes, damage or new artifacts observed should be notified to the appropriate national authority.  Relocation or removal of artifacts for the purposes of preservation, protection or to re-establish historical accuracy is allowable by Permit.

7(viii) Disposal of waste
All wastes, including all human wastes, shall be removed from the Area.

7(ix)  Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met
    1. Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and site inspection activities, which may involve the collection of small samples for analysis or review, to erect or maintain signposts, or for management activities, especially those associated with the Historic Site.
    2. Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
    3. To help maintain the ecological and scientific values of the isolation and relatively low level of human impact at the Area visitors shall take special precautions against introductions.  Of particular concern are microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils at other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica. To minimize the risk of introductions, visitors shall thoroughly clean footwear and any equipment to be used in the area  - particularly sampling equipment and markers – before entering the Area.


7(x)  Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal holder for each permit issued submit to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken.  Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR.  Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Management Plan.  Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both in any review of the management plan and in organising the scientific use of the Area.
