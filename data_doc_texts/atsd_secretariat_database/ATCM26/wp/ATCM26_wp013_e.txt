Management of Antarctic Non-Government Activities


























 Submitted by Australia
MANAGEMENT OF ANTARCTIC NON-GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES


Introduction

Australia recognises the attraction of Antarctica to many people and considers that there is value in people experiencing Antarctica for themselves.  There is no need to discourage the legitimate tourist interest in the Antarctic, provided that it is pursued in a safe and environmentally sensitive way, properly planned and fully self-sufficient.

At ATCM XXV Australia presented an Information Paper on Management of Antarctic Non-government Activities – Australian Comments (XXVATCM/IP108).  The paper summarised management challenges associated with tourist and other non-government activities in Antarctica, highlighting issues and possible responses to them.  Following inter-sessional discussions with other Treaty Parties and industry representatives those issues and responses have been refined in this paper which focuses on those that most warrant early consideration.  

These issues are: 

•	Coordination of information on non-government activities
•	Safety and self-sufficiency of adventure expeditions
•	Harmonisation of guidelines for non-government activities
•	Management of environmental impacts, including monitoring 
•	Vessel safety and insurance
•	Accreditation and self-management of non-government activities
•	Jurisdictional and EIA issues	

This paper examines these issues and proposes ten actions to address the concerns raised.  The proposed actions include the adoption of resolutions (drafts of which are attached to this paper) relating to the first three issues.


Coordination of information on non-government activities

Management of non-government activities in Antarctica could be greatly enhanced by access to comprehensive and timely data on proposed and actual non-government activities.  Currently, information on non-government activities is collected via a range of mechanisms.  For example, IAATO and the US NSF collate summary information on IAATO member activities and some other major non-IAATO operators (such as operators of large cruise vessels, over flights, and some private yachts).  Individual Parties circulate pre- and post-season summary data on known non-government activities originating in their countries in accordance with the information exchange process.  COMNAP provides information collected in its annual survey of interactions between COMNAP members and non-government operations.  Antarctic Non-government Activity News, prepared by the Australian Antarctic Division, circulates fortnightly articles about non-government activities.  Gateway states collect data on Antarctic vessels leaving from and arriving at their ports.  Individual Parties and tour operators provide information on their proposed activities to other Treaty Parties who may have an interest in those activities.

However, there is no single system that integrates the information and makes it widely available in a timely way.  Ideally, a single system would include data on proposed activities for a season, including dates, times, places to be visited, activities to be undertaken, expected number of participants, and contact details.  It would be web-based and allow proponents to input their information directly.  Established organisations could be provided with a user name and password so that they can update their data as appropriate.  The system could provide statistical summaries and reports that could be downloaded on demand from the website and be available to the wider Antarctic community.  Access to more detailed and/or potentially confidential information could be restricted (for example, to national program managers and authorities responsible for environmental impact assessment).

If Parties were to agree to establish such an information system, Parties would need to decide on the resources and timeframes needed to develop and maintain it; who should provide these resources in the short and long term; whether existing databases or products can be used for the system; and the compatibility of the proposed system with existing databases (such as the Treaty exchange information).

Action proposed:

•	Develop an electronic data system to provide access to integrated and timely information on non-government activities in Antarctica.
•	Agree on the resourcing for, and the process by which the database can be developed and managed.

Attachment A proposes a resolution to this effect.


Safety and self-sufficiency of private adventure expeditions

Antarctic adventure expeditions can be divided into those that involve activities fully managed by established commercial operators and those that involve participants organising their own adventure expeditions.

While the established tour operators generally undertake well-planned and safe ventures, experience has shown that small private adventure expeditions tend to present a greater risk of emergency incidents.  There is no effective mechanism to ensure that these expeditions are undertaken in a well-planned, safe and self-sufficient manner, despite ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1 which sets down basic requirements that these expeditions address the safety, self sufficiency and insurance aspects of their proposed activities.

Some degree of management of these expeditions can occur through the EIA process and through criteria set down by those IAATO members who provide logistic support to these expeditions.  However, there is no effective mechanism within the Treaty System to ensure a high degree of safety and self-sufficiency.  An enhanced level of safety and self-sufficiency could be achieved by developing guidelines tailored to the needs of private adventure expeditions to assist in the planning of their activities and so that there is no doubt about what is considered a prudent level of preparation.  The development of such guidelines could take account of those already developed by ANI for its private expedition clients and those to be developed by IAATO (as reported in ATCM XXV IP 72) for use by its members.

Action proposed:

•	Develop guidelines for private adventure expeditions to assist them in the planning and conduct of their activities.

Attachment B proposes a resolution to this effect.


Harmonisation of guidelines for non-government activities 

IAATO advised in ATCM XXV IP 72 that it has developed, or contributed to, fourteen separate operational guidelines over the past twelve years for a range of activities (including helicopter and boat operations, specialised adventure activities and cleaning/decontamination procedures).  It has since advised that it released revised Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines in January 2003.

While IAATO is committed to the protection of the Antarctic environment, its guidelines are mandatory for IAATO members but do not apply to non-IAATO companies and private individuals.  In addition, there may be inconsistencies between these guidelines and those promulgated by Treaty Parties — for example, in the guidelines applying to minimum distances for approaching wildlife.  Although the IAATO guidelines may acknowledge the differences between their guidelines and the various requirements of Treaty Parties, there would be value in standardised guidelines for common non-government activities that may adversely affect the Antarctic environment.  Accordingly, Australia suggests that the Parties consider adopting, in consultation with the CEP and with IAATO, agreed guidelines for common non-government activities.  The guidelines would be aimed at activities most likely to have an adverse impact on the Antarctic environment if not properly managed.  Such guidelines can, of course, also be applied to the activities of participants in national programs.

Action proposed:

•	Develop, in conjunction with CEP and IAATO, standard guidelines for an initial set of activities that are commonly undertaken by Antarctic tour operators and tourists.

Attachment C proposes a resolution to this effect.


Management of environmental impacts
	
There is an emerging concern about the cumulative impacts of tourists at frequently visited sites and at new or sensitive sites.  This issue was explored by the workshop on the cumulative impacts in the Antarctic Peninsula area in June 2000.  Site-specific data on tourist activities have been collected by the US National Science Foundation, IAATO and others for over 12 years and areas that may be subject to cumulative impact have been identified.

The predicted increase in tourists, the increasing diversity of activities and the growing number of sites regularly visited highlight the risk of cumulative impacts, particularly in the absence of good baseline data.  Australia proposes that the CEP be invited to examine the information already collected for frequently visited and sensitive sites (e.g. those containing concentrations of wildlife, unique fauna or flora, or historic sites) and assess the risk of unacceptable cumulative impacts.  This assessment would assist the Parties to develop management policies for such sites.  For particularly vulnerable sites, the Parties could also investigate the development of site-specific guidelines to provide a consistent approach to visitor management.

Action proposed:

•	Invite the CEP to assess the risks of unacceptable cumulative impacts and propose monitoring and mitigation measures as appropriate.
•	If necessary, consider the development of site-specific guidelines, particularly for vulnerable sites.

Vessel safety and insurance

Although Annex IV of the Madrid Protocol discusses the construction and manning of ships, there is very limited capacity to stop unsuitable or poorly prepared vessels operating in Antarctica.  The safety of tour vessels could, in part, be addressed by the development of a specific code for cruise vessels.  The IMO has recently released its Polar Shipping Code for Arctic Waters and COMNAP has suggested adapting this code for Antarctica.  Parties could consider adapting this code and encouraging its application by the operators of non-government activities.  Incorporation of such a code into domestic legislation may be difficult for many Parties but one option is to encourage insurers to provide more favorable cover to operators complying with the code.  In some instances, it may be viable to deny support or access to stations to operators who do not satisfy the code.  Compliance with an Antarctic code would be greatly enhanced if it were to be developed in conjunction with, and endorsed by, the IMO.  

In the current global economic and security environment, it has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for many small tour operators and private expeditions to obtain suitable insurance cover for such things as public liability and reimbursement of search and rescue costs.  Treaty Parties could investigate the availability of insurance and adopt a common approach to insurance requirements that they may impose on non-government operators.

Action proposed:

•	Adapt the IMO Polar Shipping Code for Arctic Waters to Antarctic conditions and encourage adherence to it by non-government operators.  Seek IMO endorsement of the code.
•	Consider measures to encourage the carriage of appropriate insurance, such as by linking insurance to compliance with the code.


Accreditation and industry self-management of non-government activities 

The valuable role played by IAATO in regulating the activities of its members is recognised by Australia and other Treaty Parties.  However, there will always be operators who, for various reasons, will not seek IAATO membership or may not be eligible.  As Antarctic tourist numbers grow there is potential for an increased number of operators not to be IAATO members.  

If Parties believe that self-regulation by the industry is an effective means of managing non-government activities, then there need to be mechanisms to encourage greater membership of organisations such as IAATO.  This might be advanced by IAATO further considering ways of increasing its potential membership coverage in ways that do not compromise the guidelines under which it operates.  This could include revised membership categories to encourage small or one-off operators to join, and reviewing membership costs to remove any perceived anomalies in contribution rates.

In parallel the Treaty Parties could encourage the development of an industry accreditation scheme, through industry organisations such as IAATO, that accords with requirements developed by the Antarctic Treaty system.  Such mechanisms could be based on existing international tourism accreditation schemes (such as the Green Globe 21 Ecotourism Certification Program) and apply to tour operators and individual tour guides as appropriate.  Adherence to an accreditation system could be encouraged by Parties limiting access to national program stations, historic sites and other popular sites to accredited operators.  

For an accreditation scheme to be recognised by the Antarctic Treaty system as a legitimate part of industry self-regulation it will be necessary for the relevant industry bodies to establish the credibility of the accreditation system.  The Treaty parties will want to be satisfied of the bona fides of the participants and the effectiveness of the scheme’s implementation.

The Treaty Parties could facilitate communication with IAATO on such issues by seeking to have an official ATCM observer attend IAATO meetings, and continuing the practice of inviting IAATO to participate in the ATCM as an expert.  

Possible action:

•	Work with IAATO and others to encourage membership.
•	Support development by the industry of a high quality accreditation scheme and develop mechanisms to encourage compliance with it.


Jurisdictional and EIA issues

In 2002 Australia conducted a survey of Treaty Parties whose nationals were known to undertake tourist activities in Antarctica.  The purpose of that survey was to compare the environmental impact assessment processes and legislative mechanisms used by each Party.  Information on the survey will be provided separately to the Treaty Parties.




 Attachment A


DEVELOPMENT OF A DATABASE ON NON-GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES


Outline

The proposal is to develop an electronic database to collate information about all non-government activities in Antarctica, with the exception of commercial fishing.  The data would be available, as appropriate, for interrogation by Antarctic Treaty Parties, members of the Antarctic tourism industry, and other interested members of the Antarctic community for management and planning purposes.

Suggested features of the database 

•	The database would collate information on activities by individual adventure parties, tour companies and other non-government activities in Antarctica, other than commercial fishing.
•	Input would be provided by governments, tour operators and individuals proposing non-government activities.
•	Input to the database would be via the internet.
•	A standard web-based pro forma would be used for data input.
•	The pro forma would be available in the four Treaty languages.
•	The data to be supplied would include all the information requirements set out in ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1 Attachment A and the relevant parts of Attachment 4 to the report of the XXIV ATCM.  Additionally, post-visit information, in accordance with the requirements of ATCM Resolution XIX-3, could be entered.
•	The information contained in the database would allow for the generation of reports for any management and planning purposes identified by Treaty Parties and other interested members of the Antarctic community.
•	When developing the database, consideration should be given to providing mechanisms to allow for integration of the data with other appropriate databases, such as Treaty exchange information, to avoid the need for duplication of data input.
•	To the extent possible, the database would be capable of integration with relevant EIA processes of Treaty Parties. 
•	There would be provision for Treaty Parties to view and as necessary edit data entered by their nationals.
•	Access to the database, and provision of input to the database, would be password protected and provide protection for any information provided by proponents that is regarded as confidential.
•	The database and any associated maintenance and software system would be supported by the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.  


Draft Resolution 

Coordination of information on non-government activities

The Representatives,

Concerned about the need for effective management of non-government activities in Antarctica;
	
Acknowledging the need for information about these activities to be readily accessible to all interested parties; 

Recalling the requirements for advanced notification of tourism and other non-government activities and that ATCM Resolution XIX-3 sets out information requirements for post-visit reporting of those activities;

Considering that there would be advantages in having this reporting information provided in a standardised format, in a timely manner and on a single database; and

[Noting the offer of [Party] to develop and maintain the database pending the establishment of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat].

Decide that:

1. 	An electronic database will be developed to collate and make available to Parties information about all non-government activities in Antarctica. 

2. 	Antarctic Treaty Parties will enter data about all non-government activities in Antarctica of which the become aware.

3. 	Organisers of non-government activities in Antarctica will be encouraged to enter their advanced notification information (required under ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1) into the proposed database at least 3 months prior to the proposed commencement of those activities, or by 1 October of the austral summer season in which those activities are to occur, whichever is the sooner.

4. 	Organisers of non-government activities will be encouraged to submit their post-visit reporting information (as required under ATCM Resolution XIX-3) into the proposed database.

5.	Information in the data base will be made available to all Parties, and to any other persons or organisations who have a bona fide interest in the information provided that access to it does not breach confidentiality requirements.


Attachment B 


GUIDELINES FOR ADVENTURE EXPEDITIONS

Outline

The proposed ‘Checklist for Adventure Expeditions’, attached to the following draft resolution, has been developed to promote the safety and self-sufficiency of small adventure expeditions (such as private yacht visits, polar treks, solo aircraft flights) that are undertaken as one-off activities in Antarctica by private individuals or companies.  


Draft Resolution for ATCM XXVI

Management of adventure expeditions in Antarctica

The Representatives,

Concerned that adventure expeditions in Antarctica need to be carried out in a safe and self-sufficient manner;

Recognising the potential for these expeditions to have an adverse impact on the operations of national programs or tour operators in Antarctica;

Noting that such expeditions may seek assistance and support from national programs and tour operators in order to undertake their proposed activities;

Recalling that the ‘Procedures to be Followed by Organisers and Operators’, as set out in the Attachment to ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1, requires that organisers and operators: seek to ensure that their activities are fully self-sufficient and do not require assistance from Parties (unless arrangements have been agreed in advance); ensure that they employ experienced and trained personnel; use equipment, vehicles, vessels and aircraft appropriate to Antarctic operations; are fully conversant with applicable communications, navigation, air traffic control and emergency procedures; and obtain the best available maps and hydrographic charts; and consider the question of insurance.

Recommend that:

1.	Organisers of adventure expeditions in Antarctica be encouraged to use the attached checklist in the planning and conduct of their expeditions in order to maximise the safety and self-sufficiency of those activities.


Checklist for private adventure expeditions

The organisers and/or members of the proposed expedition, should:

•	ensure that all members are medically, physically and psychologically fit to undertake the proposed activities in Antarctica;

•	ensure that the expedition leader(s) has sufficient experience in all facets of the proposed expedition to lead the activities – this might include previous experience in polar or other cold-climate regions, survival training in cold and/or remote areas, experience flying or sailing the proposed aircraft or vessels over similar terrain and/or over similar distances;

•	develop a comprehensive search and rescue contingency plan that does not require support from the operators of national Antarctic programs, without their prior consent;

•	ensure that all equipment that they will be using, including communication, navigation and emergency equipment is in good working order and is suitable for operating in Antarctic conditions; 

•	ensure that members of the expedition are proficient in the use of all equipment;

•	ensure that comprehensive first aid equipment will be available during the expedition, that at least one member of the expedition has advanced first aid training, and that effective medical evacuation plans are in place;

•	ensure adequate insurance arrangements to cover any liability issues that may arise as a result of the proposed activity, including public liability and any costs associated with search and rescue;

•	ensure that environmental impact assessment of the activity in accordance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty is undertaken in advance of the activity departing for Antarctica;

•	provide any information about the proposed activities that may be required by national programs or other national authorities, including information on the timing and objectives of the expedition; the composition of the party; and methods of travel to, from and within Antarctica.
	




Attachment C 

STANDARDISED GUIDELINES FOR COMMON ACTIVITIES


Outline

Since the adoption of guidelines in Recommendation XVIII-1 in 1994 the range and scope of non-government activities undertaken in Antarctica has expanded greatly.  In ATCM XXV IP 72, IAATO described fourteen guidelines for common non-government activities that it has contributed to or developed over the past twelve years.  There would be benefit in the Treaty Parties adopting guidelines for the more common activities, and which can be applied uniformly throughout Antarctica. These guidelines could cover the introduction and transfer of non-indigenous species; helicopter operations and small boat operations near wildlife; separation distances from wildlife; selection of landing sites; and adventure activities such as camping, kayaking and diving that may have an impact on the environment.  Consistency of approach to these activities for both IAATO and non-IAATO members and for national programs is desirable.


Draft Resolution for ATCM XXVI

Guidelines for common Antarctic activities

The Representatives,

Noting the continued increase in the scope and extent of non-government activities;

Recalling that the guidelines for the conduct of non-government activities were adopted at ATCM XVIII;

Recognising the benefits that can be obtained by ensuring that these activities are carried out in safe and environmentally sustainable manner;

Acknowledging the work that has been undertaken by IAATO and other members of the Antarctic community in developing guidelines for common activities undertaken by non-government operators;

Recommend that:

1. 	The Treaty Parties, with assistance and advice from CEP and IAATO, develop draft guidelines for consideration at ATCM XXVII on:

•	the use of helicopters and small boats in Antarctica to minimise disturbance to wildlife;
•	wildlife approach distances;
•	the cleaning, quarantine and decontamination procedures for clothing, footwear and other equipment;
•	mechanisms for selecting new sites for tourist visits and shore landings, including procedures for undertaking initial assessment of environmental impacts at those sites; 
•	the conduct of shore visits; 
•	procedures for selected adventure activities (scuba diving, kayaking and camping) that focus on minimising the potential environmental impacts of those activities.
