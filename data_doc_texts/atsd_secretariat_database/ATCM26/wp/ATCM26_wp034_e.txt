ANTHROPOGENIC ACOUSTIC NOISES AND DISCHARGES AND THEIR IMPACT ON MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS



The effects stemming from the use of acoustic methods and their environmental impact, particularly on the populations of marine mammals is a highly interesting topic for the environment, especially for the Antarctic marine one. The interest caused by the issue, as well as the contributions it has received, have been particularly significant over the past years, as can be concluded from the workshops held in Cambridge and Berlin, the documents submitted by SCAR at the XXV ATCM (IP24 and WP23) and the corresponding discussions. The knowledge of the issue is limited, and it deserves being further explored in order to take the necessary steps leading to an efficient protection of the Antarctic marine environment without jeopardizing the marine environment safety and research factors.

A number of deaths of marine mammals have occurred in different locations outside the Antarctic Treaty area that would seem to be linked to acoustic ship-borne discharges. A massive beaching of marine mammals took place between September 24 and 27, 2002, on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, belonging to the Canary Islands (Spain). The species involved were: Gervais’ beaked whale (Mesoplodon europeaus), Cuvier´s beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris).


All the species identified belonged to the Ziphiidae family. The morphological characteristics of this family are their average size (4 to 10 m), a small dorsal fin located on the hindleg of the hump and a prominent jaw. The adult male Blainville's beaked whale also has two teeth that makes it unmistakable.

Due to their habits and scarce number, there is very limited information on the biology of the species belonging to that family. Actually, some of them are only known due to the dead individuals that were found. They spend little time on the surface as their apnea can last for more than an hour. These animals spend their lives in deep waters, away from the coast, and they have very rarely been seen at depths of less than a few hundred meters. Some members of this family, such as the southern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon planifrons) and the southern four-toothed whale (Berardius arnuxii), live the Southern continent, and just like other species belonging to the same family, they feed on squid and octopus they find in deep waters, that make up their diet.

The exact number of Ziphii affected during this last beaching at the Canary Islands is not known. However, it is estimated that 14 individuals made it to the coast and that it was possible for cetacean experts to collect and study 10 dead bodies at the Veterinarian School of the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. They found ante mortem internal hemorrhages in these bodies as well as other signs corresponding to an acoustic trauma harmful pattern.

This kind of injury was also observed and described in the post-mortem examinations performed on 5 Cuvier´s beaked whale and 1 Blainville's beaked whale beached in Bahamas in May 2000.

The biological report prepared by the Sociedad para el Estudio de los Cetáceos (Society for the Study of cetaceans) in the Canary Islands concluded that the factor behind these beachings was deployed over a wide spatial area affecting all of the species/animals of a specific area. Based upon similar episodes that hade taken place in previous years, the report adds that, although species belonging to different habitats and habits, the Ziphiidae family species were those mostly affected, which means there must be some relationship between such a factor responsible for the stranding of the animals and an anatomic and/or physiological feature of the affected cetaceans. 

A group of specialists trained in California to study the impact of continuous reflection air cannons used for seismic research on marine mammals concluded in the beginning of 1999 that 180 dB was the threshold above which acoustic emissions could become dangerous for the lives of cetaceans.

Other episodes, similar to the one described for the Bahamas, or the one occurred in Greece in May 1996 have been related to military maneuvers. Some organizations, such as the Cetacean International Society, point at the sonar systems used for detecting submarines at large distances: Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System Low Frecuency Active (SURTAS LFA), as the potential cause for acoustic trauma on cetaceans.

Unfortunately, many human activities are presently being carried out in the oceans which largely overshoot the established limits. One example of these is the vast hycrocarbon exploration activity taking place in the Gulf of Mexico or in the North Sea, where frequently a number of seismic exploration campaigns are taking place at the same time and where the air-cannon explosions of each of them affect the signals of the series of hydrophones of the others, causing interferences with them, which has led to the term “seismic crew noise” to define this abnormal interference phenomenon which, on the other hand, is difficult to eliminate from the records, hence providing an idea of just how serious the acoustic pollution in these seas is.

Fortunately, according to para 1 of Article 1 of the Antarctic Treaty, military maneuvers or the use of powerful low frequency sonar devices are not allowed in hte Antarctic seas. Nor is there a significant maritime traffic. However, the same geophysical techniques as those used in the oil industry are deployed in the Antarctic seas, in order to carry out stratigraphic and tectonic studies. They are much fewer in number but the specifics of sound transmission in the area should be taken into consideration, as well as the fact that this is an area where cetaceans concentrate in summer.

The behavior of materials at the bottom of the sea, regarding their penetration by seismic exploration probes depends on their composition and spatial distribution. It is advisable to carry out a specific study of their behavior in each area, as this will allow for a better adjustment of the optimal quantity of acoustic energy required in each case as well as the most appropriate frequency ranges to use as a function of the targets.

The low water temperatures and salinity indexes prevailing in the Antarctic seas reduce the sound absorption coefficient in water. Hence, a given amount of energy used in this area will yield better results than in tropical or equatorial waters. This would thus allow to reduce the volume of the air-cannon explosion chambers as well as the air pressure in them, whereby the same scientific information could be obtained using explosions that would be less harmful to life at sea.

The energy emission of the large marine seismic exploration systems is normally omnidirectional, and it strictly follows the inverse square law falloff of signal power with distance, which leads to the use of powerful energy generating sources. A promising line of research aimed at minimizing the harmful effects of these technologies could be that of attenuating both the horizontal and sub-horizontal emission direction by means of sound absorption screens or barriers or any other system.

Regarding the areas where cetaceans concentrate which are also those considered to be important scientific goals, campaigns could be carried out during the days immediately prior to the arrival of the first individuals or right after they have left.

The considerations exposed above seem to recommend that Antarctic campaigns using methods exceeding certain impact levels should be coordinated in the future, in order to bundle them and reduce their numbers. They would be oriented towards the multipurpose rationale of various institutions, carefully studying the frequencies and power levels to be used as well as the time and place for carrying these practices out. This approach would yield other benefits, such as avoiding effort duplication in order to reach the same goals, the pooling of funds so as to take advantage of the best technology available at each step or to optimize information dissemination.

For the moment being, it seems that a priority task would be to determine, with scientific evidence, which acoustic methods produce harmful effects on the Antarctic marine environment, to what extent and above which levels. As such, it may be convenient for SCAR to continue fostering research in this field, to report on the enhancements and to keep advising the CEP so that in turn it may propose the relevant precautionary measures to be taken. Likely, it would be appropriate for those countries that are performing these activities in Antarctica to contribute to increasing the knowledge base in the field and to assist in promoting that the recommendations that may come up regarding the use of acoustic methods be included both in their national permit granting procedures and in their own activities.

Besides the methods mentioned above, there are other scientific activities which also exceed dangerous levels of acoustic discharges in the sea. Such is the case with tomographic techniques as the one used in the project called “Acoustic thermometry of the Ocean climate”, which consists in injecting a sound in the ocean in order to know the global temperature variation of the water by analyzing the fluctuation of sound propagation velocity in them and thus getting to know whether it increases or decreases over a period of a few years.

Acoustic discharges are potentially harmful for cetaceans because they can create an acoustic trauma in these animals as those believed to have happened in the case of the Bahamas and Canary Islands mass beachings. An acoustic trauma is an injury caused by the exposure to a sound. They are generally divided in two, as a function of their scope, immediateness and seriousness of the injuries caused.

A first type of trauma is that derived from lethal impacts in turn due to an acoustic discharge of such a magnitude that they damage the tissues of the animal, not only in those of the hearing organs but also in other anatomical structures bearing no relationship with the hearing organs. The trauma observed in the above mentioned cetaceans involved in the mass beaching of the Canary Islands were of this type.

	Another type of trauma is the one known as “sublethal impact”. In this case, the only damage that can be observed is the tissue injuries caused to the internal ear of the animals involved, as the dysfunction caused to the animal’s perception apparatus is due to saturation of the hearing organs. This trauma occurs when the individual is exposed to a noise the frequency and intensity of which are located within the perception threshold of its hearing organs.

The cellular injury of the internal ear which make it impossible for the animal to hear the frequencies that caused the hearing impairment need a recovery period that can vary between a few hours and several weeks.

This circumstance, which is common to many animals, may be responsible for devastating consequences in the case of cetaceans, as this type of injury may disorient them temporarily or make them “deaf” to dangers surrounding them, such as maritime traffic, with the risk it involves for them as well as the safety of the ships sharing their space.

Studies carried out by various organizations have shown that cetaceans subjected to noises with specific frequencies and intensities have behavioral alterations, such as a change in their course, they stop singing or do so with less intensity or their echolocation sound pattern changes both in frequency and intensity.

Oceans have a bottom noise which is quite homogeneous in intensity. That is why it is good to bear in mind that the industrial, military, oceanographic and production activities carried out in the marine environment are potentially dangerous for marine mammals, as under natural circumstances they are used to low noise levels.

Although the most sensitive organisms to acoustic contamination are marine mammals, they may not be the only ones to suffer: crustaceans, cephalopods and various species of vertebrates do have tissues that are sensitive to sound.

The sensitivity of a particular habitat to acoustic contamination is another issue which is being dealt with as of late. It is important to define which areas, and to what extent may be exposed to this type of contamination.

The protection features created to preserve the Antarctic natural environment, together with the marine quotas that have been established over the past years elsewhere on the planet, such as those defined by the EEC, the Community Interest Places (CIPs) which may later be declared Special Conservation Areas (SCAs) are moving in that direction.

The Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands was one of the first ones in Europe to introduce and approve a CIP proposal which includes the cetacean populations habitat in the archipelago.

Spain stopped its whaling operations in 1986 and overhauled its fleet accordingly. Besides, Spain has been collaborating with the international community in organizations such as the International Whaling Commission, and it is making the appropriate steps, in the same line, to curtail the new problems faced by these animals. On April 15 2003 the universities of Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia submitted a study to the Ministry of the Environment in which they support the proposal for 16 special cetacean protection areas inside the Spanish Exclusive Economic Zone waters. These sectors are thinking about regulating maritime traffic and controlling the corresponding activities, such as visits of cetacean habitats by tourists.

The future protection of the marine environment stems from an effort to prevent human activities from interfering with the natural course of ecosystems. Technological development in oceanography has made substantial progress over the past decades. This allows us to better understand the oceans and to be more aware than ever of the importance of its balance. Hence, with new tools and knowledge, the goal will have to be a sustainable development of our activities. This is particularly important in Antarctica by virtue of the special protection regime surrounding it.

In a nutshell, if we take into account:

    • the interest in increasing the present knowledge base regarding the effects on the Antarctic environment of marine acoustic methods; and

    • the convenience for the CEP and the Antarctic System as a whole to develop recommendations aimed at minimizing the effects of those methods on the Antarctic marine environment;

we hereby propose to recommend the following:

    a) That the countries carrying out activities in Antarctica contribute, to the extent possible, to increase the present knowledge base regarding the effects on the marine environment of acoustic methods and to develop an international coordination of marine campaigns in order to minimize the impact or noise and acoustic discharges on the Antarctic environment.

    b) That SCAR continues to foster research on the impact of acoustic methods on the marine environment by analyzing the scientific information available on the subject and providing advice to the CEP on the state of the knowledge and potential actions aimed at mitigating the negative effects that may be derived from those methods.
