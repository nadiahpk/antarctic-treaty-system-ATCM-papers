ASPA No. 139, Biscoe Point, Anvers Island



Submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection by
the United States of America


Revised Management Plans for ASPA Nos. 113, 122, and 139


Under Resolution 1 (1998), the United States was given responsibility for revising the Management Plans for a number of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (formerly referred to as Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest). 

Revised draft management plans, including draft maps, for three of these sites have been completed and are attached to this Working Paper.  They are: 

ASPA 113, Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbor, Anvers Island; 
ASPA No. 122, Arrival Heights, Hut Point Peninsula; and 
ASPA No. 139, Biscoe Point, Anvers Island

These draft management plans have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Annex V to the Environmental Protocol and consistent with the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.  In preparing the draft plans, a detailed assessment of the values of the sites and of the measures necessary to protect the sites was undertaken.  Field visits were made to each of these sites to verify information and to ensure that the information in the draft plans is accurate and up-to-date.  

The draft plans are attached for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).  The United States is prepared to chair an intersessional contact group for discussion of these plans in preparation for full consideration at CEP VII, consistent with the “Guidelines for CEP Consideration of New and Revised Draft Management Plans for Protected Areas” adopted at CEP III.
























Management Plan for
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 113
LITCHFIELD ISLAND, ARTHUR HARBOR
ANVERS ISLAND, PALMER ARCHIPELAGO

1.	Description of values to be protected
Litchfield Island (Latitude 64°46' S, Longitude 64°06' W, 2.7 km2), Arthur Harbor, Anvers Island, Antarctic Peninsula was originally designated as a Specially Protected Area through Recommendation VIII-1 (1975, SPA No. 17) after a proposal by the United States of America.  It was designated on the grounds that “Litchfield Island, together with its littoral, possesses an unusually high collection of marine and terrestrial life, is unique amongst the neighboring islands as a breeding place for six species of native birds and provides an outstanding example of the natural ecological system of the Antarctic Peninsula area”.

The current management plan reaffirms the original reasons for designation associated with the bird communities.  The island supports a diverse assemblage of bird species that is representative of the mid-western Antarctic Peninsula region.  The number of bird species recorded as breeding on Litchfield Island is seven, not six as originally stated.  The species are Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus), Wilson’s storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus), south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki), brown skuas (Catharacta loennbergi), and Antarctic terns (Sterna vittata).  The status of these bird colonies as being relatively undisturbed by human activities is also an important value of the Area.

In 1964 Litchfield Island supported one of the most extensive moss carpets known in the Antarctic Peninsula region, dominated by Warnstorfia laculosa which was then considered near its southern limit (Corner, 1964a). W. laculosa is now known to occur at a number of sites further south, including Green Island (ASPA No. 108, in the Berthelot Islands) and Avian Island (ASPA No. 118, in Marguerite Bay).  Accordingly, the value originally cited that this species is near its southern limit at Litchfield Island is no longer valid.  Nevertheless, at the time Litchfield Island represented one of the best examples of maritime Antarctic vegetation off the western coast of Graham Land. Furthermore, several banks of Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Polytrichum strictum of up to 1.2 m in depth were described in 1982, which were considered to be some of the best examples of their kind in the Antarctic Peninsula area (Fenton and Smith, 1982).  In February 2001 it was observed that these values have been severely compromised by the impact of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), which have damaged and destroyed large areas of vegetation on the lower accessible slopes of the island by trampling and nutrient enrichment.  Some areas previously richly carpeted by mosses have been completely destroyed, while others have suffered moderate-to-severe damage.  Slopes of Deschampsia antarctica are more resilient and have persisted even where fur seals have been numerous, although here signs of damage are also obvious.  However, on the steeper and higher parts of the island, and other areas that are inaccessible to seals, the vegetation remains undamaged.  While the vegetation is less extensive and some of the moss carpets have been compromised, the remaining vegetation continues to be of value and an important reason for special protection of the island.  Litchfield Island also has the most varied topography and the greatest diversity of terrestrial habitats of the islands in Arthur Harbor.

Litchfield Island has been afforded special protection for most of the modern era of scientific activity in the region, with entry permits having been issued only for compelling scientific reasons.  Litchfield Island has therefore never been subjected to intensive visitation, research or sampling and has value as terrestrial area that has been relatively undisturbed by human activities.  The Area is thus valuable as a reference site for some types of comparative studies with higher use areas, and where longer-term changes in the abundance of certain species and in the micro-climate can be monitored.  The island is easily accessible by small boat from nearby Palmer Station (US), and Arthur Harbor is visited frequently by tourist ships.  Continued special protection is therefore important to ensure the Area remains relatively undisturbed by human activities.

The designated Area is defined as including all of Litchfield Island above the low tide water level, excluding all offshore islets and rocks.

2.	Aims and objectives
Management at Litchfield Island aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance and sampling in the Area;
    • allow scientific research on the natural ecosystem and physical environment in the Area provided it is for compelling reasons which cannot be served elsewhere and provided it will not compromise the values for which the Area is protected; 
    • minimize the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the management plan.

3.	Management activities
The following management activities shall be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • Copies of this management plan, including maps of the Area, shall be made available at Palmer Station (US) on Anvers Island.
    • Markers, signs or other structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition.
    • Visits shall be made as necessary (at least once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.

4.	Period of designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Litchfield Island (64°46'15" S, 64°05'40" W, 0.35 km2) is situated in Arthur Harbor approximately 1500 m west of Palmer Station (US), Gamage Point, Anvers Island, in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula known as the Palmer Archipelago (Map 1).  Litchfield Island is one of the largest islands in Arthur Harbor, measuring approximately 1000 m northwest to southeast and 700 m from northeast to southwest.  Litchfield Island has the most varied topography and the greatest diversity of terrestrial habitats of the islands in Arthur Harbor (Bonner and Smith, 1985).  Several hills rise to between 30-40 m, with the maximum elevation of 48 m being in the central western part of the island (Map 2).  Rocky outcrops are common both on these slopes and on the coast.  The island is predominantly ice-free in summer, apart from small snow patches occurring mainly on the southern slopes and in valleys.  Cliffs of up to 10 m form the northeastern and southeastern coasts, with pebble beaches found in bays in the north and south.  

The designated Area is defined as all of Litchfield Island above the low tide water level, excluding all offshore islets and rocks.  The coast itself is a clearly defined and visually obvious boundary feature, so boundary markers have not been installed.

CLIMATE
Few meteorological data are available for Litchfield Island, although temperature data were collected at two north- and south-facing sites on Litchfield Island from January – March 1983 (Komárková 1983).  The north-facing site was the warmer of the two, with January temperatures generally ranging between 2 to 9C, February between -2 to 6C, and March -2 to 4C in 1983.  A maximum temperature of 13C and a minimum of -3C were recorded at this site over this period.  The south-facing site was generally about 2C cooler, with January temperatures generally ranging between 2 to 6C, February between -2 to 4C, and March -3 to 2C.  A maximum temperature of 9C and a minimum of -4.2C were recorded at the south-facing site. 

Longer-term data available for Palmer Station show regional temperatures to be relatively mild because of local oceanographic conditions and because of the frequent and persistent cloud cover in the Arthur Harbor region (Lowry, 1975).  Monthly air temperature averages recorded for Palmer Station over a 22-year period range from -7.8°C in August (the coldest month) to 2.5°C in January (the warmest) (Baker, 1996).  The minimum recorded temperature is -31°C and the maximum is 9°C, while the annual mean is -2.3°C.  Storms and precipitation at Palmer Station are frequent, with winds being persistent but generally light to moderate in strength, prevailing from the northeast. 

GEOLOGY, GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS
Litchfield Island is one of numerous small islands and rocky peninsulas along the southwestern coast of Anvers Island which are composed of an unusual assemblage of late Cretaceous to early Tertiary age rock types called the Altered Assemblage (Hooper, 1962).  The primary rock types of the Altered Assemblage are tonalite, a form of quartz diorite, and trondhjemite, a light-colored plutonic rock.  Also common are granite and volcanic rocks rich in minerals such as plagioclase, biotite, quartz and hornblende.  Litchfield Island is characterized by a central band of medium-dark gray, fine-grained diorites which separate the predominantly light gray medium-grained tonalites and trondhjemites of the east and west (Willan, 1985).  The eastern part is characterized by paler dykes up to 40 m across and trending north-south and east-west.  Minor quartz, epidote, chlorite, pyrite and chalcopyrite veins of up to 8 cm thick strike SSE, cutting the tonalite.  Dark gray fine-grained plagioclase-phyric dykes with traces of magnetite strike ENE to ESE.  Numerous dark gray feldspar-phyric dykes are present in the west, up to 3 m thick and trending north-south and ESE.  Some cut, or are cut by, sparse quartz, epidote, chlorite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and bornite veins of up to 20 cm thick.

The soils of Litchfield Island have not been described, although peaty soils of up to one meter in depth may be found in areas where there is, or once was, rich moss growth.

FRESHWATER HABITAT
There are a few small ponds on Litchfield Island: one small pond on a hill in the central, northeastern part of the island has been described as containing the algae Heterohormogonium sp. and Oscillatoria brevis.  Another pond 50 m further south has been described as containing Gonium sp., Prasiola crispa, P. tesselata and Navicula sp (Parker et al., 1972).

VEGETATION 
The plant communities at Litchfield Island were surveyed in detail in 1964 (Corner, 1964a).  At that time, vegetation on Litchfield Island was well-developed and comprised several distinct communities with a diverse flora (Smith and Corner, 1973).  Both species of Antarctic vascular plant, Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) were present on Litchfield Island (Corner, 1964a; Greene and Holtom, 1971; Smith and Corner, 1973).  Corner (1964a) noted that D. antarctica was common along the northern and northwestern coast of the island, with more localized patches growing further inland on ledges with depositis of mineral material (Greene and Holtom, 1971).  C. quitensis was present in two localities: a patch on the northeastern coast measuring approximately 9x2 m and a series of about six cushions scattered over a steep, flushed cliff above the northwestern coast.  Commonly associated with the two vascular plants was a moss carpet assemblage comprising Bryum pseudotriquetrum (= Bryum imperfectum), Sanionia uncinata (= Drepanocladus uncinatus), Syntrichia princeps (= Tortula grossiretis) and Warnstorfia laculosa (= Calliergidium austro-stramineum) (Corner, 1964a). 

On well-drained rocky slopes, several banks of Chorisodontium aciphyllum (= Dicranum aciphyllum) and Polytrichum strictum (= Polytrichum alpestre) were described in 1982 as up to 1.2 m in depth, and were considered to be some of the best examples of their kind in the Antarctic Peninsula area (Fenton and Smith, 1982).  The more exposed areas of moss turf were covered by crustose lichens, species of Cladonia spp. and Sphaerophorus globosus and Coelocaulon aculeatum (= Cornicularia aculeata).  In deep, sheltered gullies there was often a dense lichen cover comprising Usnea antarctica, U. aurantiaco-atra and Umbilicaria antarctica.  Raised areas of P. strictum turf of approximately 0.5 m high occurred at the bottom of a narrow, east to west trending, valley.  The hepatics Barbilophozia hatcheri and Cephaloziella varians were associated with the turf communities, particularly in frost heave channels and often occurred as stunted specimens on exposed humus.

There were a number of permanently wet areas on the island, an outstanding feature of which was one of the most extensive moss carpets known in the Antarctic Peninsula region, dominated by W. laculosa (Fenton and Smith, 1982).  Elsewhere, S. uncinata and Brachythecium austro-salebrosum formed smaller stands. Pohlia nutans lined the drier areas where the moss carpet communities merged with the moss turf communities.

Rock surfaces supported a variety of lichen-dominated communities in addition to the numerous epiphytic species that occurred on the moss banks.  An open lichen and bryophyte community covered rocks and cliffs around the coast and in the center of the island.  The southern coast of the island consisted of primarily crustose species of lichen, predominantly Usnea antarctica along with the mosses Andreaea depressinervis and A. regularis.  The foliose alga Prasiola crispa forms small stands associated with the penguin colonies and other seabird habitats.

Other species recorded as present within the Area are: the hepatic Lophozia excisa; the lichens Buellia spp., Caloplaca spp., Cetraria aculeata, Coelopogon epiphorellus, Lecanora spp., Lecidia spp., Lecidella spp., Lepraria sp., Mastodia tessellata, Ochrolechia frigida, Parmelia saxatilis, Physcia caesia, Rhizocarpon geographicum, Rhizocarpon sp., Stereocaulon glabrum, Umbilicaria decussata, Xanthoria candelaria and X. elegans; and the mosses Andreaea gainii var. gainii, Bartramia patens, Dicranoweisia grimmiacea, Pohlia cruda, Polytrichastrum alpinum, Sarconeurum glaciale and Schistidium antarctici (BAS Plant Database, 1999).

In recent years, increasing populations of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) have caused significant damage to the moss banks and carpets at lower elevations (Lewis-Smith, 1996; Harris, 2001).  South polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) nest in the moss banks and cause some local destruction.

INVERTEBRATES, BACTERIA AND FUNGI
The invertebrate fauna of Litchfield Island has not been studied in detail.  The tardigrades Macrobiotus furciger, Hypsibius alpinus and H. pinguis have been observed in moss patches, predominantly on north-facing slopes (Jennings, 1976). 

BREEDING BIRDS 
Seven bird species breed on Litchfield Island, making it one of the most diverse avifauna breeding habitats within the Arthur Harbor region.  A small Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony is situated on the eastern side of the island, which has been censused regularly since 1971 (Table 1).  Numbers of breeding pairs have declined substantially over a 30-year period, a trend which Fraser and Patterson (1997) suggested has been driven principally by long-term changes in patterns of snow accumulation.  The colony is located on a landform susceptible to increases in snow accumulation, which if persistent compromises the ability of the penguins to establish nests.

Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) breed in small numbers on Litchfield Island. Approximately 20 pairs were recorded in 1978-79, including an incubating adult that had been banded in Australia (Bonner and Smith, 1985).  More recent data on numbers of breeding pairs are given in Table 2.

It is likely that Wilson’s storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) breed within the Area, although numbers have not been determined.  Up to 50 pairs of south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) occur on the island, although the number of breeding pairs fluctuates widely from year to year.  Brown skuas (Catharacta loennbergi) are closely associated with the Adélie penguin colony (Map 2), the number of breeding pairs of which has ranged from two to eight.  The low count of two pairs in 1980-81 followed an outbreak of fowl cholera, which killed many of the brown skuas on Litchfield Island in 1979.  Hybrid breeding pairs also occur. Although 12-20 kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) are seen regularly on the island, there are only two or three nests each season.  A small number of Antarctic terns (Sterna vittata) regularly breed on Litchfield Island, usually less than a dozen pairs (approximately eight pairs in 2002-03) (Fraser, pers. comm., 2003).  They are most commonly found on the NE coast although their breeding sites change from year to year, and in 1964 they occupied a site on the NW coast (Corner 1964a).

Among the non-breeding birds commonly seen around Litchfield Island, the Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax [atriceps] bransfieldensis) breeds on Cormorant Island several kilometers to the east; chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo penguins (P. papua) are both regular summer visitors in small numbers. Snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea), cape petrels (Daption capense), Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) and southern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides), are irregular visitors in small numbers, while two gray-headed albatross (Diomedea chrysotoma) were sighted near the island in 1975 (Parmelee et al., 1977).

MARINE MAMMALS
Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) started to appear in Arthur Harbor in the mid-1970s and are now common on Litchfield Island from around February each year.  Regular censuses conducted in February and March over the period 1988-2003 have recorded on average 160 and 340 animals on the island in these months respectively (Fraser, pers. comm., 2003). 

Elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) haul out on accessible beaches from October to June, numbering on average 43 animals throughout these months since 1988 (Fraser, pers. comm., 2003).  The larger groups of a dozen or more are found in the low-lying valley on the northeastern side of the island (Map 2).  A few Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) occasionally haul out on beaches.  Both crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) may also commonly be seen on ice floes near Litchfield Island.

LITTORAL AND BENTHIC COMMUNITIES
Strong tidal currents occur between the islands within Arthur Harbor, although there are numerous sheltered coves along the coast (Richardson and Hedgpeth, 1977).  Subtidal rocky cliffs grade into soft substrate at an average depth of 15 m and numerous rock outcrops are found within the deeper soft substrate.  Sediments in Arthur Harbor are generally poorly sorted and consist primarily of silt sized particles with a low organic content (0.43 to 0.88 percent organic by weight).

The predominantly soft mud substrate approximately 200 m off the northeastern coast of Litchfield Island has been described as supporting a rich macrobenthic community, characterized by a high diversity and biomass of non-attached, deposit-feeding polychaetes, arthropods, molluscs and crustaceans (Lowry, 1975).  The fish species Notothenia neglecta, N. nudifrons and Trematomus newnesi have been recorded between 3 and 15 meters depth (De Witt and Hureau, 1979).  The Antarctic limpet (Nacella concinna) is common in the marine area around Litchfield Island (Kennicutt et al., 1992b).

HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND IMPACT
In January 1989 the vessel Bahia Paraiso ran aground 750 m south of Litchfield Island, releasing more than 600,000 liters (150,000 gallons) of petroleum into the surrounding environment (Kennicutt, 1990; Penhale et al., 1997).  The intertidal communities were most affected, and hydrocarbon contaminants were found in both sediments and inter- and sub-tidal limpets (Nacella concinna), with an estimated mortality of up to 50% (Kennicutt et al., 1992a&b; Kennicutt and Sweet, 1992; Penhale et al., 1997).  However, numbers recovered soon after the spill (Kennicutt, 1992a&b).  Levels of petroleum contaminants found in intertidal sample sites on Litchfield Island were among some of the highest recorded (Kennicutt et al., 1992b; Kennicutt and Sweet, 1992).  It was estimated that 80% of Adélie penguins nesting in the vicinity of the spill were exposed to hydrocarbon pollution, and exposed colonies were estimated to have lost an additional 16% of their numbers in that season as a direct result (Penhale et al., 1997).  However, few dead adult birds were observed.

US permit records show that between 1978-92 only about 35 people visited Litchfield Island, with possibly around three visits being made per season (Fraser and Patterson, 1997).  This suggests a total of approximately 40 visits over this 12-year period, although given that a total of 24 landings were made at the island over two seasons in 1991-93 (Fraser and Patterson, 1997), this would seem likely to represent an underestimate.  Nevertheless, visitation at Litchfield Island was undoubtedly low over this period, and has remained at a minimal level.  Visits have been primarily related to bird and seal censuses and work on terrestrial ecology.  

Plant studies carried out on Litchfield Island in 1982 (Komárková 1983) used welding rods inserted into the soil to mark study sites.  At nearby Biscoe Point (ASPA No. 139), where similar studies were conducted, numerous rods left in situ killed surrounding vegetation (Harris, 2001).  It is unknown how many of the rods were used to mark sites on Litchfield Island, or whether most were subsequently removed.  However, one was found and removed from a vegetated site in a small valley, approximately 100 m west of the summit of the island, after a brief search in February 2001 (Harris, 2001).  A more comprehensive search would be required to determine whether further welding rods remain within the Area.  No other impacts on the terrestrial environment that could be attributed to human visitation were observed on 28 February 2001, although one of the two protected area signs was in poor condition and insecurely placed.

The impact of human activities upon the terrestrial ecology, birds and seals on Litchfield Island from direct visits may thus be considered to have been minor (Bonner and Smith, 1985; Fraser and Patterson, 1997; Harris, 2001).  Whether some indirect impact on the island ecology may originate from nearby Palmer Station, such as in the case of the fowl cholera epidemic in brown skuas noted earlier, which could possibly be attributed to discharged wastes, is an unresolved question.

6(ii)  Restricted and managed zones within the Area 
None.  

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
With the exception of a cairn on the summit of the island, there are no structures present within the Area.  A permanent survey marker, consisting of a 5/8" stainless steel threaded rod, was installed on Litchfield Island by the USGS on 9 February 1999.  The marker is located near the summit of the island at 6446'13.97"S, 6405'38.85"W at an elevation of 48 m, about 8 m west of the cairn (Map 2).  The marker is set in bedrock and marked by a red plastic survey cap.  A survival cache is located near the crest of a small hill overlooking the Adélie colony, approximately 100 m south of the small boat landing site.

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within close proximity of the Area
The nearest protected areas to Litchfield Island are: Biscoe Point (ASPA No. 139) which is 16 km east of the Area adjacent to Anvers Island; South Bay (ASPA No. 146), which is approximately 27 km to the southeast at Doumer Island; and Eastern Dallmann Bay (ASPA No. 153) which is approximately 90 km to the northeast, adjacent to Brabant Island (Map 1).

7.	Permit conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by an appropriate national authority.  Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:
    • it is issued only for compelling scientific reasons that cannot be served elsewhere, or for essential management purposes consistent with plan objectives such as inspection, maintenance or review;
    • the actions permitted will not jeopardize the ecological values of the Area or the value of the Area as a terrestrial reference site;
    • any management activities are in support of the objectives of the Management Plan;
    • the actions permitted are in accordance with the Management Plan;
    • the Permit, or an authorized copy, shall be carried within the Area;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the authority named in the Permit;
    • permits shall be issued for a stated period.

7(i) Access to and movement within the Area
Access to the Area shall be by small boat, or over sea ice by vehicle or on foot.  Vehicles are prohibited and all movement within the Area shall be on foot.  The recommended landing site for small boats is on the beach in the small cove mid-way along the eastern coast of the island (Map 2).  Access by small boat at other locations around the coast is allowed, provided this is consistent with the purposes for which a Permit has been granted.  When access over sea ice is viable, there are no special restrictions on the locations where vehicle or foot access may be made, although vehicles are prohibited from being taken on land.

Boat crew, or other people in boats or vehicles, are prohibited from moving on foot beyond the immediate vicinity of the landing site unless specifically authorised by Permit. Visitors should move carefully so as to minimize disturbance to flora, fauna, and soils, and should walk on snow or rocky terrain if practical, but taking care not to damage lichens.  Pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to minimize effects.

Landing by aircraft is prohibited within the Area and any necessary overflight shall be conducted according to the height restrictions imposed in Table 3:

7(ii) Activities that are or may be conducted in the Area, including restrictions on time or place
    • Scientific research that will not jeopardize the ecosystem values of the Area or the value of the Area as a reference site, and which cannot be served elsewhere;
    • Essential management activities, including monitoring;
    • The appropriate authority should be notified of any activities/measures undertaken that were not included in the authorized Permit.

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
Structures shall not be erected within the Area except as specified in a Permit and, with the exception of permanent survey markers and the existing cairn at the summit of the island, permanent structures or installations are prohibited.  All structures, scientific equipment or markers installed in the Area must be approved by Permit for a specified period, and adequately identified by country, name of the responsible investigator or agency, and year of installation.  All such items should be made of materials that pose minimal risk of harm to fauna or of contamination of the Area.  Installation (including site selection), maintenance, modification or removal of structures shall be undertaken in a manner that minimizes disturbance to flora and fauna.  Removal of structures, equipment or markers for which the period specified in the Permit has expired shall be a condition of the Permit.

7(iv)  Location of field camps
Camping should be avoided within the Area.  However, when necessary for essential purposes specified in the Permit, temporary camping is allowed at the designated site on the terrace above the penguin colony.  The camp site is located at the foot of a small hill (~35 m), on its eastern side, approximately 100 m south-west of the small boat landing beach (Map 2).  Camping on surfaces with significant vegetation cover is prohibited.

7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which can be brought into the Area
No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and the precautions listed in 7(ix) below shall be taken against accidental introductions.  Dressed poultry should be free of disease or infection before shipment to the Area and, if introduced to the Area for food, all parts and wastes of poultry shall be completely removed from the Area and incinerated or boiled long enough to kill any potentially infective bacteria or viruses.  No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area.  Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, which may be introduced for scientific or management purposes specified in the Permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.  Fuel is not to be stored in the Area, unless specifically authorized by Permit for scientific or management purposes.  Anything introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction into the environment is minimized.  If release occurs which is likely to compromise the values of the Area, removal is encouraged only where the impact of removal is not likely to be greater than that of leaving the material in situ.

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited, except by Permit issued in accordance with Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  Where taking or harmful interference with animals is involved, the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica should be used as a minimum standard.

7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder
Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder shall only be in accordance with a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.  Anything of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder or otherwise authorized, may be removed unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ: if this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified.

7(viii) Disposal of waste
All wastes shall be removed from the Area. Human wastes may be disposed of into the sea.

7(ix)  Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met
    1. Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and site inspection activities, which may involve the collection of limited samples for analysis or review, or for protective measures.
    2. Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
    3. To help maintain the ecological and scientific values derived from the relatively low level of human impact at Litchfield Island visitors shall take special precautions against introductions.  Of concern are pathogenic, microbial, invertebrate or plant introductions sourced from other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica.  Visitors shall ensure that sampling equipment or markers brought into the Area are clean.  To the maximum extent practicable, footwear and other equipment used or brought into the Area (including backpacks, carry-bags and tents) shall be thoroughly cleaned before entering the Area.

7(x)  Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal holder for each Permit issued submits to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken.  Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR.  Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Management Plan.  Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both in any review of the management plan and in organizing the scientific use of the Area.

Management Plan for
ANTARCTIC SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No. 122
ARRIVAL HEIGHTS, HUT POINT PENINSULA, ROSS ISLAND

1	Description of values to be protected
An area at Arrival Heights was originally designated in Recommendation VIII-4 (1975, SSSI No. 2) after a proposal by the United States of America on the grounds that it was “an electromagnetic and natural ‘quiet site’ offering ideal conditions for the installation of sensitive instruments for recording minute signals associated with upper atmosphere programs”.  While it is now recognized that the electromagnetically ‘quiet’ conditions have to some degree been degraded by base operation and radio communication activities adjacent on the Hut Point Peninsula, the nature, magnitude and extent of these transmissions is such that the original values for which the site was designated are still considered worthy of protection.  Moreover, the original geographical characteristics of the site, such as its elevated position and thus broad viewing horizon, the volcanic crater morphology, and the close proximity to the full logistic support of nearby McMurdo Station (US) 1.5 km south and Scott Base (NZ) 3 km SE, continue to render the Area valuable for upper atmospheric studies and boundary layer air sampling studies.

In recent years increases in nearby science and support operations have raised the levels of locally generated electromagnetic noise since the site was first designated.  It is recognized that the values of the Area as an electromagnetically ‘quiet’ site are at risk from broad and narrow band electromagnetic interference, particularly from the nearby stations, as identified in SCAR Recommendation XXIII-6 (1994).  However, there are scientific, financial and practical constraints associated with any proposed relocation of the Area and the associated facilities.  Thus, the current preferred option for management is to minimize both internal and external sources of electromagnetic interference to the maximum extent practicable, and to monitor these levels routinely so that any significant threat to the values of the site can be identified and addressed as appropriate.

Since original designation the site has been used for several other scientific programs that benefit from the restrictions on access in place within the Area.  In particular, the broad viewing horizon and relative isolation from activities (e.g. vehicle movements, engine exhausts) has been valuable for spectroscopic and air particulate investigations, pollution surveys, as well as auroral and geomagnetic studies.  These additional values are also important reasons for special protection at Arrival Heights.

The Area continues to be of high scientific value for a variety of high quality and long-term atmospheric data sets that have been collected at this site.  Despite the acknowledged potential for interference from surrounding sources, the long-term data series, the accessibility of the site for year-round observations, its geographical advantages, and the high cost of relocation, warrant that the site receive ongoing and strengthened protection.  The vulnerability of this research to disturbance through chemical and noise pollution, in particular electromagnetic interference, is such that this Area requires continued special protection.  

2	Aims and objectives

Management at Arrival Heights aims to:

    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance to the Area;

    • allow scientific research in the Area, in particular research on the atmosphere, while ensuring protection from incompatible uses and uncontrolled equipment installation that may jeopardize such research;

    • minimize the possibility of generation of excessive electromagnetic noise interference within the Area through regulating the types, quantity and use of equipment that can be installed and operated in the Area;

    • encourage the consideration of the values of the Area in the management of surrounding activities and land uses, in particular to monitor the levels, and encourage the minimization of, sources of electromagnetic radiation that may have the potential to compromise the values of the Area;

    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the management plan.

3	Management activities

The following management activities are to be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:

    • Signs showing the location and boundaries of the Area with clear statements of entry restrictions shall be placed at appropriate locations at the boundaries of the Area to help avoid inadvertent entry.

    • Signs showing the location of the Area (stating the special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and a copy of this management plan shall be kept available, in the principal research hut facilities within the Area and at McMurdo Station and Scott Base.

    • Markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition, and removed when no longer necessary.

    • Visits shall be made as necessary (no less than once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.

    • Electromagnetic noise surveys shall be undertaken within the Area bi-annually to detect equipment faults and to monitor levels of interference that may have potential to compromise the values of the Area unacceptably, for the purposes of identification and mitigation of their sources.

    • National Antarctic Programs operating in the region shall consult together with a view to ensuring these steps are carried out.  Specifically, each such program shall appoint an Activity Coordinator who will be responsible for inter-program consultation regarding all activities within the Area.

6	Description of the Area

6(i)  Geographical coordinates, boundary markers and natural features
Arrival Heights is a small range of low hills near the SE end of Hut Point Peninsula, SE Ross Island, 1.5 km north of McMurdo Station and 3 km northwest of Scott Base.  Hut Point Peninsula is formed by a line of craters that extend south from the flanks of Mt. Erebus.  The basaltic rocks are particularly rich in ultramafic inclusions, including dunite, peroditite, pyroxenite, gabbro and sandstone.  The soil consists mostly of volcanic scoria overlying volcanic tuffs from Mt Erebus, with rocky and weathered volcanic magma. Arrival Heights is exposed to frequent strong winds, and is generally colder and windier than nearby McMurdo Station and Scott Base, with consequently minimal snow cover.  

The highest elevation within the Area is Second Crater at 255 m, one of two inactive volcanoes that are apart of the boundaries of the Area.  The boundary of the Area extends in a straight line from Trig T510 NW over First Crater to the 150 m contour.  The boundary follows this contour north to a point immediately west of Second Crater.  The boundary extends east to Second Crater, the lip of which forms the NE corner of the Area.  The boundary then extends south in a straight line to Trig T510.

The research facility is at approximately 220 m (700 ft) above sea level, and has excellent views of McMurdo Sound, Mount Erebus and the Royal Society Range.  The majority of McMurdo station is hidden from view, enhancing the radio-quiet characteristics of the area.

Arrival Heights is located at a geomagnetic latitude of about 80 degrees, right above the boundary between the auroral zone and the polar cap.  It is also close enough to the geographic pole for total darkness to occur at local noon for a significant part of the year.  This allows low intensity auroral events to be observed.  Its location near the geomagnetic pole also means that Arrival Heights lies inside the polar cap at all times.  

The Area is an electromagnetically quiet site offering good conditions for the installation of sensitive instruments to record high-resolution (less than a minute) signals associated with upper atmosphere research programs.  It is also the site closest to McMurdo Sound and Scott Base with these conditions that still allows good access and logistics support year-round.  A 1993 electromagnetic interference survey of Hut Point Peninsula and surrounding regions found that noise levels at Arrival Heights lacked the impulsive character of interference in noisier areas, eliminating the occasional bursts of high amplitude noise prevalent in these areas. 

Research teams from McMurdo Station and Scott Base use the Area extensively.  Science programs being conducted at Arrival Height’s laboratories examine natural phenomena occurring in the earth’s atmosphere and magnetosphere.  The broad focus of these science programs is toward improved understanding of the mechanisms that couple solar processes with those of the terrestrial environment.  These include investigations of phenomena associated with short-term environmental effects (auroras, induced electrical currents, radiowave communications interference), as well as those associated with longer-term effects (solar forcing on climate, changes in the ozone layer, atmospheric composition, stratospheric winds, and weather).  Instruments for these tasks include optical and radio devices for remote sensing, as well as sensors that monitor changes in the electric and geomagnetic fields. 

The instruments that measure local fields, including geomagnetic field sensors and very low frequency receivers, are sensitive to perturbations that propagate from remote generation regions.  Apart from natural sources, there are sources of radio noise detected within the Area both within the Area itself and outside the Area.  Sources of noise from within the Area include power lines, vehicle ignition systems, and equipment within the laboratories.  Sources from outside the Area include HF (2-30 MHz), VHF (30-300 MHz) and UHF (300-3,000 MHz) communications, fire and tank level alarms that use radio transmissions, entertainment broadcast systems, ship, aircraft, or satellite radio transmissions, and aircraft surveillance radars.  Sources of noise from both within and outside of the Area include household and operational appliances and equipment.

The VLF antennas are located in the crater of the larger cone, which provides shielding from local radio transmissions and station noise. 

6(ii)  Restricted and managed zones within the Area 
None.

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
Both the New Zealand and United States programs have research and living facilities within the Area.  The New Zealand program is planning to install a new laboratory facility in the 2003/2004 season.  A Satellite Earth Station (SES) is located on First Crater. 

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within close proximity of the Area
The nearest protected areas to Arrival Heights are on Ross Island: Cape Evans (ASPA 155) is the closest at 22 km north; Backdoor Bay (ASPA 157) is 32 km north, Cape Royds (ASPA 121) is 35 km NNW; Tramway Ridge (ASPA 130) near the summit of Mt. Erebus is 40 km north; Lewis Bay (ASPA 156) the site of the 1979 DC-10 passenger aircraft crash is 50 km NE; New College Valley (ASPA 116) is 65 km north at Cape Bird; and Cape Crozier (ASPA 124) is 70 km to the NE. NW White Island (ASPA 137) is 35 km to the south across the Ross Ice Shelf.

7	Permit conditions

Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a permit issued by an appropriate national authority.  Conditions for issuing a permit to enter the Area are that:

    • it is issued for scientific study of the atmosphere, in particular for studies of electromagnetic radiation, trace gases, air particulates, auroras and geomagnetism or for other scientific purposes consistent with the management plan;

When required for scientific or management purposes, transient overflight or landing may be allowed within the Area if specifically authorized by permit.  Prior written notification must be given to the appropriate authority or authorities supporting scientists conducting research in the Area at the time of the proposed aircraft activity.  The timing of the activity should be coordinated as appropriate so that possible disruption to scientific programs is minimized.

Entry by vehicle is restricted to those entering the Area to carry out science, servicing or equipment maintenance, installation of new facilities in accordance with a permit, and those permitted persons accompanying such people at the time of the visit.  All other visitors should enter the Area on foot, leaving any vehicles at the ‘Glacier Road’ intersection.  Vehicle and pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum necessary consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to minimize effects: e.g. personnel entering the Area by vehicle should coordinate travel so vehicle use is kept to a minimum.  Vehicles shall keep to the established vehicle tracks as shown on Map A, unless specifically authorized by permit otherwise.  Pedestrians should also keep to established tracks wherever possible.

7(ii) Activities that are or may be conducted in the Area, including restrictions on time or place
Activities that may be conducted within the Area include:

    • scientific research that will not jeopardize the scientific values of the Area;

    • management activities, including the installation of new facilities to support scientific research monitoring; 

    • use of hand-held and vehicle radios by visitors entering the Area is allowed; however, their use should be minimized and shall be restricted to communications for scientific, management or safety purposes.

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
No structures are to be erected within the Area except as specified in a permit.  All scientific equipment installed within the Area outside of research hut facilities must be approved by permit and clearly identified by country, name of the principal investigator and year of installation.  All such items should be made of materials that pose minimal risk of environmental contamination of the Area, and structures should be electromagnetically compatible with activities in the Area.  The time period for removal of equipment shall be specified in the permit.

No Radio Frequency (RF) transmitting equipment other than low power transceivers for local essential communication may be installed within the Area.  Electromagnetic radiation produced by equipment introduced to the Area shall not have significant adverse effects on any on-going investigations unless specifically authorized otherwise.  Precautions shall be taken to ensure that electrical equipment used within the Area is adequately shielded to keep electromagnetic noise to a minimum.

Installation or modification of structures or equipment within the Area is subject to an assessment of the likely impacts of the proposed installations or modifications on the values of the Area, as required according to national procedures.  Details of proposals and the accompanying assessment of impacts shall, in addition to any other procedures that may be required by appropriate authorities, be submitted by investigators to the activity coordinator for their national program, who will exchange documents received with other activity coordinators for the Area.  Activity coordinators will assess the proposals in consultation with national program managers and relevant investigators for the potential impacts on the scientific or natural environmental values of the Area.  Activity coordinators shall confer with each other and make recommendations (to proceed as proposed, to proceed with revisions, to trial for further assessment, or not to proceed) to their national program within 60 days of receiving a proposal.  National programs shall be responsible for notifying investigators whether or not they may proceed with their proposals and under what conditions.

7(iv)  Location of field camps
Camping within the Area is prohibited.  Overnight visitation is permitted in buildings equipped for such purposes.

7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms that can be brought into the Area
There are no specific restrictions on materials and organisms that can be brought into the Area.

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited, except in accordance with a permit issued in accordance with Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  Where animal taking or harmful interference is involved, this should, as a minimum standard, be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica.

7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the permit holder
Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.  Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the permit holder or otherwise authorized, may be removed from any part of the Area unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ: if this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified. 

7(viii)  Disposal of waste
All wastes shall be removed from the Area.

7(ix)  Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the management plan can continue to be met
    • Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out scientific monitoring and site inspection activities, which may involve the collection of data for analysis or audit, or for protective measures. 

    • Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.

    • Spectral bands of specific science interests that warrant special protection should be identified by parties active within the Area and electromagnetic noise should be maintained as much as is practicably possible outside of those frequencies.

    • Intentional electromagnetic radiation outside of the agreed frequency bands and power levels is prohibited except within agreed frequency bands and power levels or in accordance with a permit.

7(x)  Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal holder for each permit issued submits to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken.  Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report Form suggested by SCAR.  Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the management plan.  Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both for review of the management plan and in organizing the scientific use of the Area.






Management Plan for
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 139
BISCOE POINT, ANVERS ISLAND, PALMER ARCHIPELAGO

1.	Description of values to be protected
Biscoe Point (64°48'47"S, 63°47'41"W, 2.7 km2), Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago, Antarctic Peninsula, was originally designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest through Recommendation XIII-8 (1985, SSSI No. 20) after a proposal by the United States of America.  It was designated on the grounds that the “Site contains a large (approximately 5000 m2) but discontinuous stand of the two native vascular plants, Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and, less commonly, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis).  A relatively well developed loam occurs beneath closed swards of the grass and contains a rich biota, including the apterous midge Belgica antarctica.  Long-term research programmes could be jeopardised by interference from nearby Palmer Station and from tourist ships.”  

The present management plan reaffirms the exceptional ecological and scientific values associated with the rich flora and invertebrate fauna within the Area.  In addition, it is noted that the first observation of C. quitensis growing south of 60°S was made at Biscoe Point, reported by Jean-Baptiste Charcot from the Expédition Antarctiques Française in 1903-05.  The island on which Biscoe Point lies contains the most extensive communities of D. antarctica and C. quitensis in the Anvers Island vicinity, and they are of unusual abundance for this latitude.  The abundance is much greater than previously described, with almost half of the island of Biscoe Point, and much of the ice-free area of the peninsula to the north, possessing significant stands of vegetation.  The communities extend over a large proportion of the available ice-free ground, with a discontinuous cover of D. antarctica, C. quitensis and bryophytes and lichens of several species varying in density over an area of approximately 250,000 m2.  One stand of mosses in the prominent valley on the northern side of the main island extends almost continuously for 150 m along the valley floor, covering an area of approximately 6500 m2.  Individual, near-continuous stands of D. antarctica and C. quitensis reach a similar size, both on the main island and, to a lesser extent, on the promontory to the north.

Several plant community studies were in progress when the Area was designated in 1985.  Although these studies were discontinued soon after site designation, botanical research at the site has continued.  For example, D. antarctica and C. quitensis seeds have been collected from Biscoe Point for plant studies examining the influence of climate change and enhanced UV-B radiation (Day, pers. comm. 1999).  Biscoe Point was valuable for these studies because of the amount and quality of seeds available within the Area. In addition, Biscoe Point is one of the few low-lying vegetated sites that has not yet been substantially damaged by Antarctic fur seals, and as such the Area has been identified as a potential control site for assessing Antarctic fur seal impacts on vegetation and soils in this region.  

Biscoe Point is also valuable for ornithological research. Long-term studies are being conducted on both Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguin colonies present within the Area.  The gentoo colony became established at Biscoe Point some time around 1992 and, as a recently founded colony, is of particular value for monitoring long-term ecological changes to the local bird population structure and dynamics (Fraser, pers. comm., 1999).  The Adélie colony is valuable for long-term monitoring and comparison with other colonies in Arthur Harbor that are subjected to higher levels of human influence.  In this respect, the fact that the Area has been protected from significant human use, and that use allowed has been regulated by permit, for such a long period of time is of particular value.  The Adélie colony is one of the oldest in the southern Anvers Island region (more than 700 years), and as such is valuable for paleoecological studies.  The site is also the only site in the region where brown (Catharacta loennbergi), south polar (C. maccormicki) and hybrid skuas are known to occur annually.

Until recently, Biscoe Point was on a peninsula joined to Anvers Island by an ice ramp extending from the adjacent glacier.  The ice ramp disappeared as the glacier retreated, and a narrow channel now separates Anvers Island from the island on which Biscoe Point lies.  The original boundary of the Area was of geometric shape and extended to include a separate ice-free promontory 300 m to the north of this island, and also included the intervening marine environment.  The Area is now defined to include all land above the low tide water level of the main island on which Biscoe Point is situated (0.53 km2), all offshore islets and rocks within 100 m of the shore of the main island, and most of the predominantly ice-free promontory 300 m to the north (0.1 km2).  The marine component has now been excluded from the Area because of the lack of information on its values.  The Area in total is now approximately 0.63 km2.

In summary, the Area at Biscoe Point therefore has high value for its outstanding:
    • examples of vegetation communities, soils and associated terrestrial ecology;
    • ornithological interest, with several of the resident breeding bird species and associated paleoecological features possessing unusual properties, and which are the subject of long-term studies; and
    • utility as a reference site for comparative studies and monitoring.
In order to protect the values of the Area, it is important that visitation continue to remain low and be carefully managed.

2.	Aims and Objectives
Management at Biscoe Point aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance and sampling in the Area;
    • allow scientific research on the ecosystem and physical environment associated with the values for which the Area is protected, while ensuring protection from over-sampling; 
    • allow other scientific research within the Area provided it is for compelling reasons which cannot be served elsewhere and provided it will not compromise the values for which the Area is protected;
    • minimize the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the management plan.


3.	Management activities
The following management activities shall be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • Copies of this management plan, including maps of the Area, shall be made available at Palmer Station (US) on Anvers Island and at Yelcho Station (Chile) on Doumer Island.
    • Markers, signs or other structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition.
    • Visits shall be made as necessary (at least once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Biscoe Point (64°48'47"S, 63°47'41"W) is at the western extremity of a small island (0.53 km2), located close to the southern coast of Anvers Island (2700 km2) about 6 km south of Mount William (1515 m), in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula known as the Palmer Archipelago (Map 1).  Until recently, this island was joined to Anvers Island by an ice ramp extending from the adjacent southward-flowing glacier, and many maps (now incorrectly) show Biscoe Point as lying on a peninsula.  A narrow, permanent, marine channel of approximately 50 m in width now separates the island on which Biscoe Point lies from Anvers Island.  This mostly ice-free island lies south-east of Biscoe Bay and to the north of Bismarck Strait.  A smaller extent of mostly ice-free land about 300 m to the north remains joined as a peninsula to Anvers Island by an ice ramp.

The island on which Biscoe Point lies is approximately 1.8 km long in an east-west direction and of up to about 450 m in width (Map 2).  Topography consists of a series of low-lying hills, with the main east-west oriented ridge rising to a maximum altitude of about 24 m.  A small remnant ice cap (0.03 km2) rises to 12 m at the eastern end of the island, where it was formerly bridged to Anvers Island by an ice ramp.  The coastline is irregular and generally rocky, studded by offshore islets and rocks, and pitted by numerous bays. A number of the more sheltered bays harbor gentle and accessible gravel beaches.  The unnamed promontory to the north is approximately 750 m in length (east-west) by 150 m wide and is of similar character, although of lower topography. 

Palmer Station (US) is located 13.8 km north-west of the Area at Arthur Harbor, Yelcho Station (Chile) is located approximately 12 km to the southeast at Doumer Island, while ‘Base A’ (UK, Historic Site No. 61) is located at Port Lockroy, Goudier Island (off Wiencke Island) approximately 13 km to the east (Map 1).

BOUNDARIES
The original boundary of the Area was of geometric shape to include the land associated with Biscoe Point, the separate ice-free promontory 300 m to the north, and also the intervening islands and marine environment.  A recent detailed review revealed little information to substantiate special values associated with the local marine environment.  The marine area is not the subject of current or planned scientific studies, nor is it being subjected to specific pressures or threats requiring management.  For these reasons, the boundary has been revised to exclude the marine environment.  The Area is now defined to include all land above the low tide water level of the main island on which Biscoe Point is situated (0.53 km2), all offshore islets and rocks within 100 m of the shore of this main island, and most of the predominantly ice-free promontory 300 m to the north (0.1 km2) (Map 2).  The landward (eastern) boundary on the northern promontory bisects the peninsula at the point where it protrudes from Anvers Island, distinguished by a small bay cutting into the glacier in the south and a similar, although less pronounced, coastline feature in the north.  The total area including the main island and the northern promontory is approximately 0.63 km2.

CLIMATE 
No meteorological data are available for Biscoe Point, although data are available for Palmer Station (US), where conditions are expected to be broadly similar.  Monthly air temperature averages recorded for Palmer Station over a 22-year period range from -7.8°C in August (the coldest month) to 2.5°C in January (the warmest) (Baker, 1996).  The minimum recorded temperature is -31°C and the maximum is 9°C, while the annual mean is -2.3°C.  Storms and precipitation at Palmer Station are frequent, with winds being persistent but generally light to moderate in strength, prevailing from the north-east.  Cloud cover is frequently extensive, often with a ceiling of less than 300 m.  While these broad patterns are expected to be reflected at Biscoe Point, the Area is in a more exposed position that is open to weather particularly from the west and south, which may result in some minor climatic differences. 

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Specific descriptions are not available of the geology of island on which Biscoe Point lies, or of the peninsula to the north.  However, the bedrock appears to be composed mainly of gabbros and adamellites of Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary age belonging to the Andean Intrusive Suite, which dominate the composition of southeastern Anvers Island (Hooper, 1958).  Gabbro is a dark, coarse-grained plutonic rock that is mineralogically similar to basalt, and which is composed mainly of calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene.  Adamellite is a granitic rock composed of 10-50% quartz and which contains plagioclase feldspar.  A fine mineral soil is present on the gentle terrain, although precise soil characteristics have yet to be described.  A relatively well-developed, loamy soil is associated with the closed swards of Deschampsia.

FRESHWATER HABITAT
A number of small seasonal streams and ponds are present on the island on which Biscoe Point lies, although they have not been scientifically described.  A small pond (perhaps the largest, at approximately 30 m x 8 m) and stream occur in a valley on the southern side of the principal ridge of the island, 50 m NE of the southern small boat landing site (Map 2).  The presence of a long rubber hose suggests that at one time visitors may have collected fresh water from this site.  Another freshwater pond of similar size (approximately 25 m x 6 m) is found in the prominent east-west trending valley on the northern side of the island.  A small associated stream drains this pond to the west.  The freshwater environment has thus far escaped significant disturbance from seals.  Information on the hydrology of the separate promontory to the north is not available.

VEGETATION 
The most significant aspect of the vegetation at Biscoe Point is the abundance and reproductive success of the two native Antarctic flowering plants, the Antarctic hair grass Deschampsia antarctica and Antarctic pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis.  The communities of D. antarctica and C. quitensis at Biscoe Point are the most extensive in the Anvers Island vicinity and are considered particularly abundant for such a southerly location (Greene and Holtom 1971; Komárková 1983, 1984; Komárková, Poncet and Poncet 1985).  The first observation of C. quitensis growing south of 60°S was made near Biscoe Point, recorded (as C. crassifolius) by the biologist Turquet on Jean-Baptiste Charcot’s Expédition Antarctiques Française (1903-05).  More recently, seeds from both flowering plants within the Area have been collected for propagation in studies on the effects of climate change and UV-B exposure on these species being conducted out of Palmer Station (Day, pers. comm., 1999; Xiong, 2000).

The abundance of D. antarctica and C. quitensis is much greater than previously described, and almost half of the island on which Biscoe Point lies, and much of the ice-free area of the peninsula to the north, possess significant stands of these species and a wide range of bryophytes and lichens.  The approximate distribution of the most substantial stands of vegetation on the main island has been estimated from air and ground photography (Map 3).  The distribution illustrated in Map 3 is intended as a general guide to the main areas of vegetation cover, rather than as a definitive description, and is not based on a precise ground survey.  However, it does serve to indicate the scale of the vegetated communities, which comprise a discontinuous cover of varied composition and density over an area of approximately 250,000 m2.  Komárková (1983) noted a discontinuous stand of D. antarctica and C. quitensis reaching approximately 5000 m2 on the main island.  One particularly extensive stand of mosses in the principal valley on the northern side of the main island extends almost continuously for 240 m along the valley floor, occupying an area of approximately 8000 m2 (Harris, 2001).  Stands of lesser extent are present elsewhere on the island and on the separate promontory 300 m to the north. Colonization has been observed occurring on recently deglaciated material.

Mosses tend to dominate on valley floors, close to streams and ponds, and in moist depressions.  On valley sides, mixed communities of moss and C. quitensis are frequent on lower north-facing slopes, with an increasing prevalence of D. antarctica with elevation.  Mixed D. antarctica and C. quitensis communities are particularly prolific on northern slopes between 10-20 m, while D. antarctica tends to be more frequent on the higher exposed sites above 20 m.  Mosses and lichens are frequently co-dominants or subordinate taxa. In some habitats C. quitensis may occur in small patches alone.  Patches of dead vascular plants of up to 20 m2 have been observed within the Area, believed to result from the effects of desiccation, flooding and frost during some summers (Komárková, Poncet and Poncet 1985).  

Unlike many other low-lying coastal sites in the region, the vegetation at Biscoe Point does not appear to have been severely affected by the recent substantial increase in numbers of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella).  As such, the Area has been identified as a potential control site for assessing Antarctic fur seal impacts on vegetation and soil (Day, pers. comm., 1999).

INVERTEBRATES, BACTERIA AND FUNGI
The apterous midge Belgica antarctica has been observed associated with the well-developed loam and closed swards of grass.  No further information is available on the invertebrate assemblages in the Area, although in view of the well-developed plant communities a rich invertebrate fauna might be expected.  There is no information available on local bacterial or fungal communities.

BREEDING BIRDS AND MAMMALS
At least six species of birds breed on the island on which Biscoe Point lies.  The most numerous colony is of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), located on the ridge of a promontory on the south side of the island, above a narrow cove on the southern coast (Map 3).  A gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colony was discovered on slopes on the northern side of this cove, on the southern side of the main island ridge, in 1992-93 (Fraser, pers. comm., 1999) (Map 3).  Data on numbers of breeding pairs are presented in Table 1.

The Adélie colonies are some of the oldest in the region (more than 700 years), and have been the subject of paleoecological studies, while the gentoo colony is considered particularly interesting because it has been recently established (Fraser, pers. comm., 1999).  Long-term studies are being conducted on the population structure and dynamics of the penguin colonies within the Area, which make a useful comparison with other colonies in Arthur Harbor that are subjected to higher levels of human influence (Fraser, pers. comm., 1999).

South polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) and brown skuas (C. loennbergi) breed within the Area annually, and hybrids also occur.  On the island on which Biscoe Point lies, 132 pairs of south polar skuas and one pair of brown skuas were counted on 26-27 February 2001 (Harris, 2001).  Concurrently, 15 pairs of south polar skuas, usually with one or two chicks, were counted on the promontory 300 m to the north. Kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) and Antarctic terns (Sterna vittata) breed within the Area (Fraser, pers. comm., 2000), although data on numbers are not available.  Information on other bird species that breed within the Area, or that transiently visit, is not available.

Small numbers of non-breeding Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) (several counted on the island in late-February 2001 – Harris, 2001), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) have been observed on beaches in summer. Despite the presence of beaches and terrain suitable for haul-out, relatively few seals are typically observed within the Area.  This may be a result of the observed frequent persistence of dense brash ice originating from glaciers calving from nearby Anvers Island (Fraser, pers. comm., 1999).  Further information on numbers and breeding status, or on other seal species, is not available. No information is available on the local marine environment. 


HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND IMPACT
Human activity within the Area appears to have been minimal, but few details have been recorded.  The first documented human activity in the vicinity of Biscoe Point occurred over 150 years ago, when John Biscoe, Royal Navy, entered the bay now named after him on 21 February 1832.  Biscoe recorded a landing on Anvers Island, probably near Biscoe Point, to take formal possession for the United Kingdom of what he believed to be part of the mainland of Antarctica (Hattersley-Smith, 1991).  The next recorded visit to Biscoe Point was in 1903-05, when Turquet made observations of C. quitensis at the site on the Première Expédition Antarctiques Française led by Charcot.

More recently, formal plots for plant studies were established on the island near Biscoe Point in 1982 (Komárková, 1983), although the long-term research originally planned was discontinued soon thereafter. Komárková used welding rods inserted into the soil to mark study sites.  A partial survey accurately mapped the positions ( 2 m) of 44 welding rods found in soils and vegetation during a systematic search made on the northeastern side of the island in February 2001 (Map 3) (Harris, 2001).  The rods were located in an area of some of the richest vegetation on the island, and distributed over an area of at least 8000 m2.  In general, they had been inserted into soil or vegetation with chemically coated ends downwards.  Contaminants from the rods appeared to kill all vegetation up to 20 cm from where the rods lay.  Numerous rods have been found in previous seasons, possibly numbering in the hundreds (Fraser, Patterson, Day: pers. comms., 1999-2002).  All rods found have been removed.  The Area is not considered suitable as a reference site for measuring chemical contamination, because there remains uncertainty over contaminant types and concentrations, which sites have been affected, and the extent to which contaminants may have moved through soil, water and biological systems.

Fraser (pers. comm., 2001) also reported markers made of lead present in the gentoo colony.  In addition, seaborne litter (mostly wood) may be found on beaches, and there remains a rubber hose (15 m long, ~15 cm diameter) in a small valley near the southern small boat landing site, which may once have been used for water supply purposes.

Recent scientific studies within the Area have focused on monitoring the breeding status of penguins and skuas, and the Area has also been used for the collection of seeds of Deschampsia and Colobanthus for ecological research in the Palmer Station region.  Permits have been required to visit the Area since the site was specially protected in 1985.

6(ii)  Restricted and managed zones within the Area 
None.

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
No structures are known to be present within the Area.  A permanent survey marker, consisting of a 5/8" stainless steel threaded rod, was installed on the island on which Biscoe Point lies by the USGS on 31 January 1999.  The marker is located at 6448'40.12"S, 6346'26.42"W at an elevation of 23 m (Maps 2 & 3).  It is sited approximately midway along the principal ridgeline of the island, about 100 m north of the southern small boat landing site.  The marker is set in bedrock and marked by a red plastic survey cap.

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within close proximity of the Area
The nearest protected areas to Biscoe Point are: Litchfield Island (ASPA No. 113) which is 16 km west of the Area in Arthur Harbor; South Bay (ASPA No. 146), which is approximately 12 km to the southeast at Doumer Island; and Eastern Dallmann Bay (ASPA No. 153) which is approximately 85 km to the northeast, adjacent to Brabant Island (Map 1).

7.	Permit conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by an appropriate national authority.  Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the Area are that:
    • it is issued for scientific study of the ecology of the Area, or for other scientific study which will not compromise the values for which the Area is protected; 
    • it is issued for essential management purposes consistent with plan objectives such as inspection, maintenance or review;
    • the actions permitted will not jeopardize the ecological or scientific values of the Area;
    • any management activities are in support of the objectives of the management plan ;
    • the actions permitted are in accordance with the management plan ;
    • the Permit, or an authorised copy, shall be carried within the Area;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the authority named in the Permit;
    • permits shall be issued for a stated period.

7(i)  Access to and movement within the Area
Access to the Area shall be by small boat, by aircraft, or over sea ice by vehicle or on foot.

Boat access
The recommended landing sites for small boats are at either of the following locations (Maps 2&3): 
    (i) on the beach on the northern shore of the elongated cove on the southern coast of the island, which is the site most likely to be free of sea ice;
    (ii) on the beach in the small cove mid-way along the northern coast of the island, adjacent to the designated camp and helicopter landing sites.
Access by small boat at other locations around the coast is allowed, provided this is consistent with the purposes for which a Permit has been granted.

Aircraft access and overflight
When necessary for purposes consistent with plan objectives, aircraft may operate and land within the Area according to strict observance of the following conditions:
    (i) All overflight of the Area for purposes other than access shall be conducted according to the height restrictions imposed in Table 2.

    (ii) Helicopter landing is permitted at two designated sites (Map 2), the first (A) on the main island on which Biscoe Point lies, and the second (B) on the separate promontory 300 m further to the north.  The landing sites with their coordinates are described as follows: 
    (A) on beach gravels a few meters above sea level 35 m east of the beach on the eastern shore of a small cove on the northern coast of the island (64°48'35"S, 63°46'49"W). A small tidal pool of about 25 m in diameter is located 30 m east of the landing site; and 
    (B) on the permanent snow slope approximately 50-100 m east of the ice-free ground on the northern promontory (64°48'22"S, 63°46'24"W).
    (iii) The designated and preferred aircraft access route to landing site (A) is from the west to north-west, from the region of Biscoe Bay (Map 2).  When required by prevailing conditions and for safety, access may be made from the north to north-east, over the Anvers Island ice cap, or (less preferably) from the south-west, over the area of Biscoe Point.  However, because of the presence of breeding bird colonies, it is prohibited for aircraft to approach / depart landing site (A) from over the region south of the main ridge-line of the island on which Biscoe Point lies, or from directly over the ice-free ground on the separate promontory 300 m to the north.
    (iv) The designated and preferred aircraft access routes to the northern peninsula landing site (B) are either from a northerly direction, from the region of Biscoe Bay or over the Anvers Island ice cap, or from a southerly direction, over the stretch of sea immediately south of the promontory (Map 2).  Again because of the presence of breeding bird colonies, it is prohibited to approach / depart landing site (B) over the ice-free ground on the northern promontory, or over the region south of the main ridge-line of the island on which Biscoe Point lies.
    (v) Use of smoke grenades to indicate wind direction is prohibited within the Area unless absolutely necessary for safety, and any grenades used should be retrieved.

Vehicle access and use
When access over sea ice is viable, there are no special restrictions on the locations where such access may be made, although vehicles are prohibited from being taken on land within the Area. 

Foot access and movement within the Area
Movement on land within the Area shall be on foot.  All people in aircraft, boats, or vehicles are prohibited from moving on foot beyond the immediate vicinity of their landing site unless specifically authorised by Permit.  Visitors should move carefully so as to minimize disturbance to flora, fauna, and soils, and should walk on snow or rocky terrain if practical, but taking care not to damage lichens.  Pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to minimize effects.

7(ii) Activities that are or may be conducted in the Area, including restrictions on time or place
    • Scientific research that will not jeopardize the ecosystem or scientific values of the Area;
    • Essential management activities, including monitoring;
    • The appropriate authority should be notified of any activities/measures undertaken that were not included in the authorised Permit.

7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
Structures shall not be erected within the Area except as specified in a Permit and, with the exception of the permanent survey marker, permanent structures or installations are prohibited.  All structures, scientific equipment or markers installed in the Area must be approved by Permit for a specified period, and adequately identified by country, name of the responsible investigator or agency, and year of installation.  All such items should be made of materials that pose minimal risk of harm to fauna or of contamination of the Area.  Installation (including site selection), maintenance, modification or removal of structures shall be undertaken in a manner that minimizes disturbance to flora and fauna.  Removal of structures, equipment or markers for which the period specified in the Permit has expired shall be a condition of the Permit.

7(iv)  Location of field camps
Temporary camping is allowed within the Area at the designated site about 50 m north-east of helicopter landing site (A), on the northern coast of the main island on which Biscoe Point lies.  The camp site is located on beach gravels and rocky ground a few meters above sea level, immediately north of a transient tidal pool, and is separated from the sea further to the north by a low rocky ridge of about 8 m.  When necessary for essential purposes specified in the Permit, temporary camping is allowed on the separate peninsula 300 m to the north, although a specific camping site has not been determined.  Camping on surfaces with significant vegetation cover is prohibited.

7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which can be brought into the Area
No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and the precautions listed in 7(ix) below shall be taken against accidental introductions.  Dressed poultry should be free of disease or infection before shipment to the Area and, if introduced to the Area for food, all parts and wastes of poultry shall be completely removed from the Area and incinerated or boiled long enough to kill any potentially infective bacteria or viruses.  No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area.  Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, which may be introduced for scientific or management purposes specified in the Permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.  Fuel is not to be stored in the Area, unless specifically authorized by Permit for scientific or management purposes.  Anything introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction into the environment is minimized.  If release occurs which is likely to compromise the values of the Area, removal is encouraged only where the impact of removal is not likely to be greater than that of leaving the material in situ.

7(vi) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited, except by Permit issued in accordance with Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  Where taking or harmful interference with animals is involved, the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica should be used as a minimum standard.

7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder
Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit holder shall only be in accordance with a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.  Anything of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder or otherwise authorized, may be removed unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ: if this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified.

7(viii) Disposal of waste
All wastes shall be removed from the Area. Human wastes may be disposed of into the sea.

7(ix)  Measures that are necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the management plan  can continue to be met
    4. Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and site inspection activities, which may involve the collection of limited samples for analysis or review, or for protective measures.
    5. Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
    6. To help maintain the ecological and scientific values derived from the relatively low level of human impact within the Area visitors shall take special precautions against introductions.  Of concern are pathogenic, microbial, invertebrate or plant introductions sourced from other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica.  Visitors shall ensure that sampling equipment or markers brought into the Area are clean.  To the maximum extent practicable, footwear and other equipment used or brought into the Area (including backpacks, carry-bags and tents) shall be thoroughly cleaned before entering the Area.

7(x)  Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal holder for each Permit issued submits to the appropriate authority a report describing the activities undertaken.  Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR.  Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the management plan.  Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be used both in any review of the management plan and in organising the scientific use of the Area.
