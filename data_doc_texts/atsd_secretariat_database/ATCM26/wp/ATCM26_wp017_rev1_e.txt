Review of the List of Historic Sites and Monuments 

Working Paper submitted by the UK


Introduction

1.	Resolution 4 (2001) on Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs) identified the need for a ‘review of the complete List of Historic Sites and Monuments’, and recommended that those Consultative Parties identified as ‘proposing Parties’ conduct a review of the HSMs which they solely or jointly proposed at previous ATCMs.

2.	The UK offered to liaise with the Parties intersessionally in order to assist with the review.

Review by Questionnaire Survey

3.	A questionnaire survey was distributed to 17 Parties (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, China, France, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the USA) requesting information on the continued existence and relevance of the site, the need for amendments to the site description (including boundaries if appropriate), the requirement for special protection (as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area – ASPA) or management (as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area – ASMA), and confirmation of the Party or Parties responsible for the ongoing management of the site.

4. 	All 17 Parties individually or jointly completed and returned the questionnaire. IAATO’s expert advice was also gratefully received. 

Results

5. 	The descriptions of many of the HSMs have been revised and updated (Annex 1).

6.	Three of the 76 adopted HSMs no longer exist and have been removed from the list. They are:

HSM No. 25 -  ‘ Hut and plaque on Peter I Øy, built by the Norwegian Captain Nils Larsen in February 1929 at Framnaesodden  (Lat 6847'S, Long 9042'W). The plaque is inscribed ‘Norvegia-ekspedisjonen 2/2 1929’. This site was destroyed through natural processes. 

HSM No. 31 - ‘Memorial plaque marking the position of a cemetery on Deception Island where some 40 Norwegian whalers were buried in the first half of the twentieth century. The cemetery was swept away by a volcanic eruption in February 1969’. The plaque was removed by persons unknown. Since the site was adopted in 1972, a coffin has come to the surface due to resurgence. Also, the cross of a Norwegian carpenter buried in the cemetery was re-instated in 2002. 

HSM No. 58 – ‘Cairn with memorial plaque erected at Whalers Bay, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, in the vicinity of the whalers cemetery (Historic Monument No. 31), to honour Captain Adolfus Amandus Andresen, Antarctic pioneer who was the first to establish a whaling operation at Deception Island in 1906’. The cairn and plaque were removed by persons unknown. 

The values for which HSM No.’s 31 and 58 were adopted have been incorporated into the revised description for HSM No. 71, also at Whalers Bay, Deception Island. 

    7. Currently, 8 HSMs  (No’s 15, 16, 17,18, 22, 59, 67, and 69) are also protected by inclusion within ASPAs.

9.	Attached to this paper is a draft Measure and an updated List of Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica. It is proposed that the revised list of HSMs be adopted. A draft Measure to this effect is attached.
