ANTARCTIC SHIPPING GUIDELINES

Working Paper Submitted by the United Kingdom

Background

    1. A full summary of the history and background to this issue, up to and including ATCM XXIV is attached at Annex A. 

    2. At ATCM XXV, the UK presented Working Paper (XXV ATCM / WP41) endorsing the need for technical guidelines for vessels operating in Antarctic waters.  In the same Working Paper the UK also reported that during its intersessional discussions among Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties it was clear that the majority view was to await completion of the Arctic Shipping Guidelines under development by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), before taking the matter further.

    3. At ATCM XXV COMNAP also presented Information Paper (XXV ATCM / IP40), in which COMNAP supported further development of Antarctic Shipping Guidelines.  COMNAP also advised that the then current version of the IMO’s draft Arctic Guidelines provided a useful basis for developing Antarctic Guidelines, and provided specific observations as to the amendments that would be required to achieve this.  COMNAP also recommended that further development of the Antarctic Shipping Guidelines should be postponed until the IMO had completed its work on the Arctic Guidelines.

    4. On the basis of these papers, ATCM XXV decided to await completion of the IMO Arctic Guidelines and to consider the issue in detail at ATCM XXVI (paras 97 to 99 of the Final Report of ATCM XXV refer).

IMO Arctic Guidelines

    5. Since ATCM XXV, the IMO has adopted and published the “Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-covered Waters”.

    6. The Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), at its seventy-sixth session (2 to 13 December 2002), and the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), at its forty-eighth session (7 to 11 October 2002), approved the recommendatory “Guidelines for ships operating in Arctic ice-covered waters”.  The joint MSC/MEPC Circular, to which the Arctic Guidelines are attached, is appended to this Working Paper (Annex B).

Antarctic Shipping Guidelines

    7. The UK continues to attach importance to addressing the issue of guidelines for vessels operating in Antarctic waters.  Such an approach would:

    • Address the provisions of Article 10 of Annex IV to the Protocol on the design, construction, manning and equipment of ships engaged in supporting Antarctic operations;
    • Address also the observations of COMNAP that a maritime incident represents one of the most significant risks to the Antarctic environment (XXIII ATCM / WP16);
    • Establish common minimum standards for vessels operating in Antarctic waters at a time of growth in such activity  - particularly within the maritime tourism sector where a number of vessels are flagged with 3rd Party States, and where there is an increasing trend towards larger passenger vessels.

    8. In relation to this last issue, the UK notes that ATCM XXIII agreed to seek subsequent adoption of the Antarctic Shipping Guidelines by IMO as a means of extending their applicability to members of the IMO that are not ATCPs.  Decision 2 (1999) refers.

Next Steps

    9. The UK proposed that this matter requires a substantive discussion at ATCM XXVI.  The following is suggested as a possible way forward.

    10. As noted above COMNAP has already undertaken a technical review of the IMO’s draft (as was) “Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-covered Waters”, and concluded that with some relatively modest amendments, those Guidelines could indeed be extended to the Antarctic Treaty Area (ATCM XXV / IP 40 refers).

    11. On the basis of the final version of the Arctic Guidelines now adopted by the IMO, it is recommended that COMNAP should be asked whether its Recommendations of 2002 still hold.  If so, preparation of an amended (Antarctic) version of the Guidelines should be a relatively straightforward exercise.

    12. It is further recommended that the ATCM adopt its own Guidelines for Antarctic Shipping prior to taking such Guidelines back to the IMO, given the length of time that the documents may take to achieve formal adoption in the IMO.  Shipping Guidelines adopted by the ATCM would, in the shorter-term, ensure that at least a proportion of Antarctic shipping (that flagged by Treaty Parties) could be held under agreed standards.  Such a move would, we expect, also be taken note of by IAATO.  If however consistency of standards is to be achieved across the wider range of vessels operating within the Antarctic Treaty Area, then the involvement of the IMO will be crucial; so that third Party-flagged vessels are also addressed.

Summary

    13. As indicated in the UK’s Working Paper on the Management and Regulation of Antarctic Tourism, and as a matter of some import, we recommend that Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties :- 

    • Ask COMNAP to confirm whether its Recommendations of 2002 still hold;

    • Critically evaluate the applicability of the Arctic Guidelines (as adopted by the IMO) to Antarctic conditions.  (We recognise that from a technical point of view COMNAP has already undertaken such an exercise, but political determination  has yet to take place);

    • Adopt Guidelines, in existing or modified form (to suit Antarctic conditions) by means of a decision of the ATCM;

    • Subsequently transmit those Guidelines to the IMO for their consideration and  (hopefully) adoption.
Annex A: History and Background

    • In 1991, shortly after the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill in Alaska and the grounding and sinking of the BAHIA PARAISO in Antarctica, there was a meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Marine Safety Committee (MSC).

    • At the 59th session of MSC, Germany introduced a short paper that discussed “Requirements for ships intended for Polar waters”.  Germany suggested that the following simple rule might be included in SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea), Chapter II-1:

“Ships intended for service in Polar Waters should have suitable ice strengthening for Polar conditions in accordance with the rules of a recognized classification society.”

    • MSC 59 referred this matter to the Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Equipment (DE).

    • DE, in turn, agreed to allow an Outside Correspondence Group, to develop proposed Guidance for Ships Operating in Polar Waters.  This Outside Working Group operated outside of the cognizance of IMO.

    • The result of the effort of the Outside Correspondence Group was a substantial draft document called “The Polar Code” that proposed to establish a broad set of new rules for ships operating in the Polar Regions.  The draft Polar Code was submitted to DE 41 in 1998. 

    • DE 41 decided to disseminate the draft Polar Code to IMO’s technical sub-committee’s for further review.

    • ATCM XXII (Tromso, 1998) concluded that the Polar Code as drafted failed adequately to account for the special conditions of the Antarctic.  ATCPs were encouraged to contact their national representatives to the IMO and express their concerns (Resolution 3 (1998) refers).

    • In May 1999, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC 71), further reviewed the draft Polar Code and, following the concerns of a number of member countries, decided to:

    1. Further develop the “code” as non-mandatory guidelines;
    2. Apply the guidelines only to SOLAS vessels (i.e. ships on international voyages; larger than 500 grt etc);
    3. Apply the guidelines only to “ice covered waters” north of 60N;
    4. Exclude Antarctica from the area of application of the guidelines unless Antarctic Treaty members decide otherwise;
    5. Ensure that the guidelines only contain provisions that are not already covered by other instruments such as SOLAS and MARPOL;
    6. Remove inconsistencies between the document and other international conventions (in particular, UNCLOS).

    • ATCM XXIII (Lima, 1999 – which met immediately following IMO’s MSC 71 meeting), concurred with IMO’s decision to exclude Antarctica from the guidelines under development by IMO and decided separately to:

    1. Give priority to the development of guidelines for Antarctic shipping and related activities pursuant to Article 10 of Annex IV of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty;
    2. Seek subsequent adoption of these guidelines by IMO as a means of extending their applicability to members of IMO that are not Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties;
    3. Convene a Meeting of Experts under the provisions of Recommendation IV-24, with the aim of developing draft guidelines for Antarctic shipping and related activities (Decision 2 (1999) refers).

    • The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts was held in London, April 2000.  Following a three-day meeting a series of recommendations were agreed and submitted to ATCM XXIV.

    • At ATCM XXIV (St Petersburg, 2001) the Consultative Parties considered the recommendations put forward by the Meeting of Experts (XXIV ATCM / WP 26), but made little further progress on the issue.  However, the UK offered to consult intersessionally with interested Parties, COMNAP, IAATO and others as appropriate, to see how the issue of Antarctic shipping guidelines might be progressed.

    • Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-covered Waters adopted by IMO, December 2002.























(Aside:  There is a parallel effort underway that will also effect the design of ships operating in Polar waters.  The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) (an independent body, not a part of the IMO) is developing unified requirements that will “Harmonize” the various classification society rules  (ABS, Germanischer Lloyd, DNV, Canadian ASPPR, Russian Maritime Register of Shipping, etc.).  This is expected to be a worthwhile engineering effort and, once completed, complimentary to anything that IMO would develop).
