Antarctic Protected Area System:
A Draft Antarctic Specially Managed Area Plan 
for the 
McMurdo Dry Valleys, Southern Victoria Land




A Working Paper Submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection
submitted jointly by 
the United States and New Zealand


The McMurdo Dry Valleys are located in Southern Victoria Land along the western coast of McMurdo Sound, southern Ross Sea, at approximately 77°S, 162°E.  The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest ice-free region in Antarctica, with approximately thirty percent of the ground surface largely free of snow and ice.  The unique features of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, including perennially frozen lakes, geological features, and sediments are of great scientific importance.  The Area is further regarded its wilderness, aesthetic, and educational values.

Increasing human activity in the Area and potentially conflicting interests have made it necessary to effectively manage and coordinate activities within the Area to ensure that its scientific, aesthetic, wilderness and ecological values are protected.   

The United States and New Zealand have jointly developed a draft management plan for a proposed Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) for the McMurdo Dry Valleys, consistent with the provisions of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  The attached draft ASMA plan represents the culmination of several years of effort on the part of national programs operating in the Area and the many scientists active in the valleys.

The management plan incorporates a zoning concept to manage activities and features in the landscape in a practical manner.  Within the proposed Area, there are three types of zones: Facilities Zones, a Tourism Zone, and Special Features.  This zoning concept manages multiple uses of, and activities in, the Area while providing protection for those features for which the Area is valued.  Specific guidelines for conduct of activities are associated with each zone.  

The plan also includes other sets of guidelines: the Environmental Code of Conduct for the McMurdo Dry Valley; Additional Guidelines for Scientific Research; Guidelines for Facilities Zones; Guidelines for the Tourism Zone; and Guidelines for Special Features.  The Environmental Code of Conduct comprises general guidelines for activities in the Area, and has already been implemented by both the United States and New Zealand national Antarctic programs.  The Additional Guidelines for Scientific Research contain more specific guidelines for scientific researchers working in various types of environments within the Dry Valleys, including streams, lakes, soils, and glaciers.

The draft plan and maps are provided for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).

1.  Description of values to be protected
The McMurdo Dry Valleys are located in southern Victoria Land along the western coast of McMurdo Sound, southern Ross Sea, at approximately 77°S, 162°E.  An area of approximately 15,000 km2 is designated as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (hereafter referred to as the “Area”) to manage human activities in the valleys, for the protection of scientific, wilderness, ecological, and aesthetic values. 

The McMurdo Dry Valleys are characterized as the largest relatively ice-free region in Antarctica with approximately thirty percent of the ground surface largely free of snow and ice.  The region encompasses a cold desert ecosystem, whose climate is not only cold and extremely arid (in the Wright Valley the mean annual temperature is  –19.8°C and annual precipitation is less than 100 mm water equivalent), but also windy.  The landscape of the Area contains glaciers, mountain ranges, ice-covered lakes, meltwater streams, arid patterned soils and permafrost, sand dunes, and interconnected watershed systems.  These watersheds have a regional influence on the McMurdo Sound marine ecosystem.  The Area’s location, where large-scale seasonal shifts in the water phase occur, is of great importance to the study of climate change.  Through shifts in the ice-water balance over time, resulting in contraction and expansion of hydrological features as well as recorded in the accumulations of trace gases in ancient snow, the McMurdo Dry Valley terrain also contains records of past climate change.  The extreme climate of the region serves as an important analogue for the conditions of ancient Earth and contemporary Mars, where such climate may have dominated the evolution of landscape and biota. 

The Area is characterized by unique ecosystems of low biodiversity and reduced food web complexity.  However, as the largest ice-free region in Antarctica, the McMurdo Dry Valleys also contain relatively diverse habitats compared with other ice-free areas.   The Area contains unusual microhabitats and biological communities (such as endolithic and Cryoconite systems) as well as special geological features and minerals (for example, salt deposits and desert pavements).  Some of these special geological features are of value because of they contain an extremely long record of natural events.  The long-term data sets for environmental observations that have been collected in this region are some of the longest in Antarctica.  The McMurdo Dry Valleys contain indicators of past and present regional climate change, as well as features that play a role in influencing local climate change.

These scientific values are also of global as well as regional importance.  The Area is a valuable resource for understanding landscape processes and the stability of Antarctic ice sheets.  The McMurdo Dry Valleys contain unique surface deposits including glacially deposited and modified sediments, sand dunes, desert pavement, glacio-lacustrine sediments, and marine fjord sediments containing valuable records of planetary change.  The soil, rock, water, and ice environments and their associated biota are of scientific value as model ecosystems that allow deep insights into natural processes operating throughout the biosphere.  Finally, the species that reside in the McMurdo Dry Valleys provide a biological resource for understanding adaptation to extreme environments, and are true end members of ecological continua.

The McMurdo Dry Valleys are also valued for their wilderness quality.  They represent a nearly pristine environment largely undisturbed and uncontaminated by humans.  The dramatic landscape, composed of high ridges and sweeping valleys, and contrasts of ice-free and glacier-covered terrain creates unique vistas with high aesthetic value. 

2.  Aims and objectives
The Area requires special management to ensure that its scientific, wilderness, ecological, and aesthetic values are protected, including that data sets collected over the last 100 years will continue to be of high value.  Increasing human activity and potentially conflicting interests have made it is necessary to more effectively manage and coordinate activities within the Area.

The overall aim is to manage and coordinate human activities in the Area such that the values of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are sustained in the long term.  The specific objectives of management in the Area are to:

    • Facilitate scientific research while maintaining stewardship of the environment;

    • Assist with planning and coordination of all activities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys;

    • Manage conflicts between different values and activities, including conflicts between different areas of scientific research, as well as between tour operations and scientific research.

    • Ensure the long-term protection of ecosystem integrity and special features through the minimization of cumulative environmental impacts of human activities;

    • Conserve the scientific, wilderness, ecological, and aesthetic values of the Area;

    • Minimize the possibility of the introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;

    • Promote the use of transportation modes that have the least environmental impact. 

    • Minimize the use of fossil fuels for the conduct of activities in the Area;

    • Minimize the footprint of all facilities and scientific experiments established in the Area, including the proliferation of field camps.

3.  Management activities
The following management activities are to be undertaken to achieve the aims and objectives of this plan:

    • National Programs active within the Area should establish a Management Coordination Group to oversee coordination of activities in the ASMA.  The Management Coordination Group is established to ensure effective communication among those parties active in the Area, to provide a venue to resolve any potential conflicts in uses, to minimize the duplication of activities, and to evaluate the effectiveness of management activities.  This group should convene on an annual basis to review past, existing, and future activities and make recommendations on the implementation of this management plan. 

    • National Programs operating in the Area shall promote the dissemination of information to all parties operating in the Area to ensure the enforcement of the management plan;

    • National Programs operating in the Area shall ensure that all personnel in their programs visiting the Area have been briefed on the requirements of the management plan and in particular on the Environmental Code of Conduct that applies within the Area.

    • Copies of this management plan together with the maps and appendices shall be kept in appropriate stations and research hut facilities and be made available to all persons in the Area;

    • Tourism and any other non-governmental activities should be coordinated with National Programs operating in the Area.  Operators should ensure that all visitors have been informed of the requirements of the management plan and in particular on the Environmental Code of Conduct (Appendix A) that applies within the Area.

    • Visits shall be made as necessary (no less than once every five years) to evaluate whether the management plan is effective and to ensure management and maintenance measures are adequate.

Note that guidelines for the conduct of specific activities and for specific zones within the Area are found in Appendices B, C, D, and E (also see section 7 of this management plan).

6.  Description of the Area
6(i)  Geographical coordinates, boundary markers, and natural features
The Area boundaries have been defined primarily on the basis of the hydrological catchments in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, including all of the ice-free ground and adjacent areas within these catchments, all of the Convoy Range, and the catchment of the Alph River.  Starting at the northwest corner and moving counter-clockwise, the boundary is delineated by the following features: the northwest tip of Allan Nunatak (76.7167ºS, 159.6667ºE), Carapace Nunatak (76.8833°S, 159.4°E), Mt. DeWitt (77.2S, 159.8333E), the western edge of Horseshoe Mountain (77.5667ºS, 159.95ºE), Depot Nunatak (77.75ºS, 160.0667ºE), the southern most peak of the Lashly Mountains (77.9606ºS, 159.5603ºE), Mt. Kempe (78.3167ºS, 162.7167ºE), the Pyramid (78.35ºS, 163.5ºE), the east side of Heald Island (78.25ºS, 163.8167ºE), DeMaster Point (off the eastern end of Marshall Valley, 78.0792ºS 164.4131º), north along the coast following the mean low tide level to the east side of Tripp Island (76.6333ºS, 162.7ºE), the southern edge of Fry Glacier (76.6333ºS, 162.3ºE), and, again the northwest tip of the Allan Nunatak (76.7167ºS, 159.6667ºE).  Given the large size of the Area and the prominence of physical features that define the boundaries, boundary markers are not installed.

All geographic coordinates in this management plan are given in decimal degrees format.

6(ii)  Restricted and managed zones within the Area
This management plan establishes three types of managed zones within the Area: Facilities Zones, a Tourism Zone, and Special Features.  The objective of a zoning concept is to manage for multiple uses of and activities in the Area while providing protection for those features for which the Area is valued.  The Facilities Zones intend to contain areas of primary human activity, the Tourism Zone specifies the area where tourism activities may occur, and the Special Features are established to provide additional protection for environmental features of special value.  Each zone, discussed in the sections below, has specific guidelines for the conduct of activities, found in Appendices C, D, and E.

6(ii)(a) Facilities Zones
Facilities Zones have been established to contain temporary and semi-permanent facilities within pre-defined areas and thereby control their distribution.  Facilities Zones may be areas where human presence is intended to be semi-permanent or for a defined period of time in which significant activity is occurring.  They may also be areas where human presence is expected to have regular occupation and/or repetitive activity.  New Facilities Zones may need to be established from time to time.  The establishment of new Facilities Zones should be considered and coordinated by the Management Coordination Group, and should be designed to minimize the footprint of facilities and associated materials.

The following management activities should be undertaken for Facilities Zones:
    • Alternative energy sources and energy efficiency should be considered in the planning and maintenance of activities within the Facilities Zones;

    • Waste management should be considered in the planning and maintenance of activities within the Facilities Zone;

    • Facilities Zones should be periodically assessed for usefulness, improvement or removal;

    • As appropriate, contingency plans for emergencies should be developed to take into account the special needs of specific Facilities Zones; 

    • Facilities Zones should not be located on or in close proximity to Special Features.

Facilities Zones are listed in Appendix C with locations, boundary descriptions, and guidelines for conduct in the Zones.  Maps A, B, and C shows the location of the Facilities Zones, and Maps D-M show the individual Facilities Zones.

6(ii)(b)  Tourism Zone
The Tourism Zone is located in an area of high aesthetic value near the Canada Glacier in the Taylor Valley, where safe and easy access and movement within the area can be reasonably assured with minimal impact to science activities or the environment.  The site was established based on consultations with the national programs operating in the Area and the tourism industry.  The site has received carefully managed visitation by tour parties in the past.  Tourism activities should be restricted to this area.  

Guidelines for the conduct of activities within the Tourism Zone are located in Appendix D, along with the location and boundary description of the Tourism Zone.  Map N shows the location of the Tourism Zone.

6(ii)(c)  Special Features 
Special Features are designated areas which are of particularly high scientific value and which are particularly sensitive to human disturbance.  For these reasons, Special Features require additional measures to ensure their protection.

Special Features are listed in Appendix E with a brief description of their scientific importance, their locations, and guidelines for conduct.  Map A shows the location of Special Features.

6(iii)  Structures within and near the Area
The main structures in the Area are located within the Wright and Taylor valleys, at Marble Point, at Cape Roberts, and at Odell Glacier.  There are three semi-permanent field camps in the Wright Valley, and five semi-permanent field camps in the Taylor Valley.  Map A shows the location of all structures within the Area.

Table 1 summarizes information about each of the sites containing structures in the Area, including the National Program maintaining each site, the geographic coordinates and location description of each site, and a description of the structures at each site including dimensions.

Seven sites in the Area were drilled as a part of the McMurdo Dry Valley Drilling Project carried out between 1971 and 1975.  Drill sites for the program are located at Lake Vanda (DVDP 4) (drilled 85.8 m below ice surface), Don Juan Pond (DVDP 5) (3.4 m), Lake Vida (DVDP 6) (305.8 m), Lake Fryxell (DVDP 7) (11.1 m), New Harbor (DVDP 8 and 9) (157.5 m and 38.3 m, respectively), and Commonwealth Glacier. 

6(iv)  Location of other protected areas within the Area
There are four existing ASPAs within the Area.  A permit is required for entry into these protected areas.  They are:
ASPA 123, Barwick and BalhamValleys
ASPA 131, Canada Glacier
ASPA 138 , Linnaeus Terrace
ASPA 154 , Botany Bay 

7.  Code of Conduct
The overall Code of Conduct in this section is the main instrument for the management of activities in the Area.  It outlines the overall management and operational principles for the Area.  

In addition, further guidance is provided in the Environmental Code of Conduct for the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Appendix A), which is based on an earlier code of conduct that resulted from numerous consultations between Treaty nations.  To date, the Environmental Code of Conduct has been implemented by the national Antarctic programs of New Zealand and the United States.  It is important that all persons visiting the McMurdo Dry Valleys be aware of the guidelines outlined in the Appendix A before entering the Area.

7(i)  Access to and movement within the Area
The Area is large and has numerous potential access points. Access to the Area is normally made by helicopter from Ross Island, or over sea ice via New Harbor or Marble Point.  Designated helicopter pads should be used for helicopter landings.  Where these are unavailable, known landing sites should be used when possible.  Where it is expected that helicopters will be used for repetitive access to a particular location, consideration should be given to establishing a designated site for landing.  Such suggestions should be referred to the Management Coordination Group.  Overflight restrictions are in place over ASPA No. 123 in the Barwick and Balham Valleys, ASPA No. 131 at Canada Glacier, and ASPA No. 154 at Botany Bay.  Special provisions on overflight of and landing near Special Features may apply, and these are described in Appendix E, Guidelines for Special Features.

All pedestrian access routes and movement within the Area should be undertaken so as to minimize disturbance to the soil and vegetated surfaces.  There are a number of walking routes in the Area.  In the Taylor Valley, these include routes between F-6 Camp and Lake Fryxell Camp, F-6 Camp and Lake Hoare Camp, Lake Hoare Camp and Lake Fryxell Camp, and Lake Hoare Camp and Lake Bonney Camp.  There is a route from the edge of Lake Fryxell to the weir at Canada Stream.  There are also routes outside the immediate vicinity of F-6, Lake Fryxell, Lake Bonney, and Lake Hoare camps.  In the Wright Valley, there is a route between the Vanda Weir and the Vanda Huts.  There is a loosely defined route along the Onyx River between Lake Vanda and Lake Brownworth.  In places, remnants of tracks from overland vehicles moving along the route in the 1970’s remain.

The use of vehicles in the Area should be restricted to lake ice except where specifically authorized to do so, or at Marble Point, New Harbor, and Cape Roberts where vehicles should keep to existing vehicle tracks.
 
7(ii) Activities that may be conducted in the Area
All activities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys should be conducted in such a manner as to minimize environmental impacts.  Alternative energy sources (e.g. solar, wind, fuel cells) should be used as much as possible to minimize fossil fuel usage.  Specific guidelines on the conduct of activities in the Area can be found in the Appendices. 

Tourism activities should be undertaken so as to minimize as much as possible adverse impacts on the McMurdo Dry Valleys ecosystem and the scientific activities in the Area.  Tour operators should provide visit schedules to National Programs operating in the Area in advance of their visits.  Tourism movements in the Area should avoid stream crossings.  Tourism activities should be confined to the designated Tourism Zone.  Guidelines for conduct of activities in the Tourism Zone are outlined in Appendix D.

7(iii)  Installation, modification, or removal of structures
Care should be exercised when locating and establishing installations to minimize their impact on the environment.  Installation sites should be re-used to the greatest extent possible and the location recorded.  The footprint of installations should be kept to the minimum practicable.  No structures should be installed outside of Facilities Zones.  The installation of new structures and establishment of new Facilities Zones should be considered by the Management Coordination Group.  

7(iv) Field camps
In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, a field camp is considered to be a small (generally one or two tents), temporary camp set up for research in a field season.  Field camps are generally remote from Facilities Zones.  Care should be exercised when locating and establishing campsites to minimize their impact on the environment.  Campsites should be re-used to the greatest extent possible and the location recorded.  The footprint of campsites should be kept to the minimum practicable.

7(v) Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna
This is prohibited, except in accordance with a permit issued under Article 3 of Annex II.  Where animal taking or harmful interference is involved, this should, as a minimum standard, be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica.

7(vi) Collection or removal of material found in the Area
Material should only be collected or removed from the Area for scientific, management, and educational purposes and should be limited to the minimum necessary for those needs. Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area may be removed unless the impact of removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in place.  If this is the case the appropriate authority should be notified.

7(vii) Waste management
All materials taken into the Area should be collected and removed from the Area to the maximum extent practicable. Water used for any human purposes, including scientific purposes, should be removed and/or treated in a greywater evaporator (and residuals removed).  All human wastes should be removed from the Area.

7(viii) Requirements for reports
Reports of activities in the Area should be maintained by the Management Coordination Group to the greatest extent possible, and made available to all parties.  Tour operators should record their visits to the Area, including the number of visitors, dates, and incidents in the Area, and submit this data to the Management Coordination Group.  Geographical coordinates for all field camps should be recorded.  With regard to the special features, all visits and activities at the special features should be recorded and all sampling at the special features, including type and quantity, should be recorded.

8. Provisions for the exchange of information in advance of proposed activities
In addition to the normal exchange of information by means of the annual, national reports to the Parties of the Antarctic Treaty, and to SCAR and COMNAP, Parties operating in the Area should exchange information through the Management Coordination Group.

APPENDIX A:
Environmental Code of Conduct for the McMurdo Dry Valleys

Why are the McMurdo Dry Valleys considered to be so important? The McMurdo Dry Valleys ecosystem contains geological and biological features that date back thousands to millions of years.  Many of these ancient features could be easily and irreversibly damaged by human actions.  Unusual communities of microscopic life forms, low biodiversity, simple food webs with limited trophic competition, severe temperature stress, aridity and nutrient limitations are other characteristics that make the McMurdo Dry Valleys unique.  This ancient desert landscape and its biological communities have very little natural ability to recover from disturbance.  Research in such systems must aim to minimize impacts on land, water and ice to protect them for future generations. 

Materials:
    • Everything taken into the Area should be removed and returned to the appropriate national program station for proper handling.
    • Activities that would result in the dispersal of foreign materials should be avoided  (e.g. do not use spray paint to mark rocks) or should be conducted inside a hut or tent (e.g. all cutting, sawing and unpacking). 
    • Do not leave any travel equipment behind (e.g. ice screws, pitons).
Waste and spill incidents:
	Water used for ANY human purpose should be removed and/or treated in a greywater evaporator (and residuals removed). 
    • All human waste should be collected and removed. 
    • Individuals or groups should always carry proper containers for human waste and gray water so that they may be properly and safely transported and disposed.  
    • Spill incidents should be reported to the appropriate National Program.
    • The location of any spill should be recorded in the group’s field report.
Energy:
    • Solar and wind power should be used as much as possible to minimize fuel usage.
Travel operations:
    • Ground vehicle usage should be restricted to ice surfaces unless specifically authorized to do otherwise, or at Marble Point, Cape Roberts, and New Harbor.
    • Designated helicopter pads should be used for helicopter landings.  Where these are unavailable, known landing sites should be used when possible.  
    • Markers that are clearly visible from the air should be used to mark helicopter pads.
    • Helicopter operations should not use smoke bombs, except for essential safety purposes.
    • Care should be taken to ensure that helicopter sling loads are properly secured.  Trained personnel should supervise these operations.
    • Fuel release should be avoided.

    • When traveling on foot, stay on established trails whenever possible.  

    • Avoid walking on vegetated areas. 

    • Cairns should not be built in the Area.

    • Be aware of Special Features and their guidelines.

Safety
    • Individuals or groups should bring sufficient equipment, survival or otherwise, into the Area to ensure safety.  

Field camps:  location and set up
    • Campsites should be located as far away as practical from lakeshores, streambeds, Special Features, and long-term experiments to avoid damage or contamination.  Do not camp in streambeds, even if they are dry.

    • Where rocks are moved for campsites or other activities, they should be replaced in their footprint if possible, and at minimum should be placed with the salt-encrusted side faced-down.

    • Campsites should be re-used wherever possible. 

    • The location of field camps should be recorded in the group’s field report.

    • Ensure that equipment and supplies are properly secured at all times to avoid dispersion by high winds.

Fuel and chemicals
    • Steps should be taken to prevent the accidental release of chemicals including laboratory reagents and isotopes (stable or radioactive).  Chemicals of all kinds should be dispensed over drip trays or other forms of containment.  When permitted to use radioisotopes, safety and handling instructions should be followed precisely.

    • When using chemicals or fuels, ensure that spill kits appropriate to the volume of the substance are available.  Those working with chemicals and fuels should be familiar with their use and with appropriate spill response procedures.

    • Chemical and fuel containers should be securely positioned and capped, particularly on lake ice.  

    • All fuel drums should be provided with some form of secondary containment.

    • Fuel cans with spouts should be used when refueling generators.  Generators and vehicles should be refueled over drip trays with absorbent spill pads. 

    • Vehicle oil should not be changed except over a drip tray.
	
Lakes:
    • Explosives should not be used on a lake. 

    • Vehicles should be used on lake ice only when essential; they should be parked on permanent ice rather than moat ice during the period of summer melt.

    • Where possible, ensure that nothing is left frozen into the lake ice that may ablate out and cause later contamination.

    • Avoid swimming or diving in the lakes, except when approved by a national program.

Streams:
    • Stream crossings should be avoided; when it is necessary to cross streams, designated crossing points should be used whenever possible.

    • Avoid walking in the streambed at any time to avoid disturbing the stream biota.

    • Avoid walking close to stream sides.

Valley floor and sides:
    • Avoid disturbing mummified seals or penguins.

    • Avoid sliding down screes or sand dunes.

    • Avoid disturbing (e.g. by walking through) long-term soil experiments.

    • Avoid disturbing the raised delta surfaces, which mark ancient shorelines.

High Desert:
    • Beware not to damage delicate rock formations. 


Appendix B:
Additional Guidelines for Conduct of Scientific Research

Research activities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys include research on climate, glaciers, streams, lakes, soils, and local geology and geomorphology.  The following prevention and mitigation guidelines for scientific conduct seek to reduce the impact of research activities specific to key environments in the Area.  These guidelines have been drawn from the report McMurdo Dry Valley Lakes: Impacts of Research Activities (Wharton, R.A. and Doran, P.T., 1998), the product of an international workshop of scientists conducting research in the Area.

Sampling and experimental sites
    • All sampling equipment should be clean before being brought into the Area.

    • The location of sampling sites should be recorded in the group’s field report.

    • Do not displace or collect specimens of any kind, including fossils, except for scientific and educational purposes.   

    • Once a sampling hole has been drilled in lake ice or a soil pit has been dug, it should be kept clean and all sampling equipment should be securely tethered.

    • Avoid leaving markers (e.g. flags) and other equipment for more than one season without marking them clearly with the event number and duration of the project.

Scientific installations
For scientific installations, including meteorological stations, geographic monuments, communication repeaters, lake monitoring systems, and level recorders:
    • Installations should be sited carefully, should be easily retrievable when required, and properly secured at all times to avoid dispersal by high winds.

    • All installations in the Area should be clearly identified by country, name of the principal investigator and year of installation.

    • Installations should be as energy-efficient as possible and use renewable energy sources wherever practicable.

    • Installations should pose minimal risk of harmful emissions to the environment (e.g. use gel cells or other non-spill batteries).

    • Geographic locations of installations should be recorded.

    • Materials liable to shatter at low temperatures, for example many polyethylene based plastics, should be avoided.  Likewise, wooden and fabric components in semi-permanent structures should be avoided as these are subject to wind abrasion and occasional failure.

Streams
    • Use flumes rather than weirs.

    • Use local sand or soil in sandbags when constructing flumes or control structures.

    • Document the geographic location of all stream control structures, biological transects, and instrumentation.

    • Periodically (every 3-5 years) evaluate in-stream structures (e.g., flumes) for deterioration, usefulness, and potential removal.

    • Limit the number of tracer and manipulative experiments.  Whenever possible, use modeling approaches to extend the application of experimental results to other streams and lake basins.

    • Use only naturally occurring tracers and document tracer use.

    • Design tracer experiments to limit the movement of tracers in lakes.  The incremental flux from the experiment should be appropriately small in proportion to the average annual total flux for that solute from streams.  Choose an experimental site with a long enough reach such that reactions will be completed by the end of the reach.

    • Establish specific sites for biomass sampling and document geographic locations, sampling extent, and frequency.

    • Limit biomass sample size to that required for the planned analyses and archiving.

    • Develop and apply methods (e.g., spectral analysis) that do not rely on removal of samples for quantifying changes in biomass in streams.

Lakes
    • Minimize the duration and extent to which structures are placed on the ice.  When placing structures on the ice near shore, place them on the perennial ice rather than the moat (the moat is highly susceptible to rapid melting).  Document the geographic location of the placement of structures on the ice.

    • Minimize the use of fossil-fuel-powered equipment; use solar-powered and hand devices when possible.  Use barriers (e.g., drip pans) between equipment (e.g. motors, tools) and ice to minimize the potential for hydrocarbon introduction into the ice as well as the physical melting of the ice surface.  Always have appropriate spill kits available.

    • Document the area and the extent to which lake ice has been excavated, taking geographic coordinates.  Areas that have been used for sampling or accessing the lake should be reused to the extent possible.

    • Minimize the use of motorized vehicles.  All-terrain vehicles with four-stroke engines are preferable to snowmobiles with two-stroke engines (less efficient combustion in two-stroke engines causes an increase in the release of hydrocarbons and particulates).

    • Use extreme caution when driving motorized vehicles to avoid rolling the vehicle or breaking through the ice cover.

    • Remove materials brought up from beneath the ice.  Do not dump or deposit water and sediment samples on the lake ice.

    • Reduce helicopter overflights after the ice surfaces begin to melt and keep landings on lakes to a minimum.

    • Avoid storage of materials on the lake ice surface.

    • Use separate samplers (e.g., water collectors, plankton nets) and instruments, if feasible, for each lake to avoid cross contamination.  Samplers or instruments used in more than one lake should be thoroughly cleaned (sterilize if possible) prior to reuse in a different lake.

    • Carefully manage chemical waste, glycol, and all other liquid wastes (including gray water from the lakes themselves) to avoid spills.

    • Consider laboratory-based alternatives to in situ experiments involving any radioisotope, stable isotope, or other tracer in view of the future integrity of the biological and chemical properties of the lakes.  Complete preliminary calculations to ascertain the potential impact of isotope experiments.  Document and record any introductions.

    • Incorporate metal-free haul lines and sampling containers such as “go-flow” bottles into sampling protocols to minimize metal contamination of the lakes.

    • Promote use of an environmentally friendly substitute for glycol for use in melting access holes (e.g., a biodegradable antifreeze).

    • Minimize the amount of gray water waste by collecting the least volume of water and sediment needed for research purposes.

    • Train individuals working on the lake ice to take steps to reduce the loss of equipment through ice holes.

    • Provide adequate training for research divers and support teams so that impacts to the lake environment are minimized.

    • Prior to conducting diving or ROV operations in a particular lake, consider previous diving history at the proposed research site, the proximity of other areas of interest, and the vulnerability of the water column and benthos to disturbance.  These considerations should also be applied to other sampling and measuring activities.

    • Assemble and maintain records of diving and ROV activities, including timing, intensity, and duration.

    • Use technological developments (e.g. rebreather apparatus, push-pull systems) that mitigate the environmental impacts of diving. 

Soils
    • Restore disturbed surfaces as close as possible to their natural state upon completion of the work.  For larger-scale excavations (greater than 1 m2), take photographs prior to breaking ground to provide a basis for restoration.  Record the location of the remediated site.

    • Place excavated soil on mats or groundsheets during soil sampling.

    • Backfill all excavations to approximate original contour and replace desert pavement where possible.  The desert pavement can be skimmed from the surface prior to digging and kept aside for replacement.

    • Document the geographic location of all soil sampling sites (even if they have been back-filled).

    • Conduct thorough environmental assessment of proposed exogenous amendment experiments.

    • Limit use of mechanical equipment (e.g., Cobra drills, soil augers).

Glaciers
    • Minimize the use of liquid water (e.g., with hot water drills).

    • Avoid the use of chemicals and chemical solutions on the ice.

    • If stakes or other markers are placed on a glacier, use the minimum number of stakes required to meet the needs of the research; where possible, label these with event number and project duration.

    • Provide spill kits on-site where power tools are being used.  Always refuel using drip pans.

    • Properly tune generators to minimize emissions and use only when necessary.  Always place generators and fuel cans in drip pans.

    • Use electric chainsaws powered by a four-stroke generator whenever possible for large-scale sawing operations (less contamination than from two-stoke engines).  Avoid the use of chainsaw blade lubricants when cutting cold ice.

    • Upon completion of a research project, remove all materials – wood, metal, and sensors – embedded in the ice to minimize contamination.

    • Use gel cell or other non-spill batteries.

High Desert:
    • Only the minimum sample of endolithic community required for scientific analysis should be collected.

APPENDIX D:
Guidelines for the Tourism Zone

Special guidelines for activities within the Tourism Zone include that:

    • Tourist movements in the Tourism Zone should be conducted in small, guided groups.

    • Tour operators should ensure that footpaths in the Tourism Zone are clearly marked and that visitors stay on those routes.  Markers used to mark tourist routes and sites of interest should be removed at the end of each visit.

    • Tour expedition landings should be made at a landing site at 77.6358°S, 163.0656°E.

    • Tour groups should not camp in the Tourism Zone except for reasons of life-safety.

The Tourism Zone is located in the Taylor Valley by the Canada Glacier.  The boundary goes from a northernmost point by the Canada Glacier, southeast to a point northwest of a mossy area and nearby mummified seal, continuing southwest along the Canada Glacier, south to a point southwest of a bamboo marker, southeast to a point south of a rock cairn, southeast following high points encompassing the flat area of the Zone and a footpath to a point in the south, north continuing to parallel the footpath along elevated features in the landscape, northwest passing northeast of a mummified seal and the tent site and back to the original northernmost point by the Canada Glacier.
APPENDIX E:
Guidelines for Special Features

The following guidelines apply to the Special Features listed in this Appendix:

    • Minimize sampling and research activities at or around Special Features. 

    • All sampling at the Special Features, including type and quantity, should be recorded in group field reports and provided to the appropriate national program.

    • Land helicopters at an appropriate distance from each Special Feature.
