Agenda Item 4c






Final Report from the Intersessional Contact Group on
Cumulative Environmental Impacts



Submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection by
the United States of America

Background

At CEP IV (St. Petersburg, July 2002), the Committee established an intersessional contact group (ICG) to consider means to further a coordinated approach to monitoring cumulative impacts that objective.  The Terms of Reference agreed upon for the ICG were to:
    • present an annotated summary of past and continuing studies and reports that are examining cumulative environmental impacts pertinent to the Protocol, including, for example, those examining tourism, national programmes, and non-governmental expeditions;
    • consider and advise on how future studies on human impacts could be coordinated and conducted, including the roles that SCAR, COMNAP, CCAMLR and IAATO, ASOC and other non-governmental organizations might play in this work;
    • identify priorities for future studies on cumulative environmental impacts of human activity in Antarctica;

The contact group was requested to provide a progress report to CEP V and a final report to CEP VI.  The ICG was chaired by Dr. Joyce Jatko of the United States.  Participants included Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, IAATO and ASOC.

Terms of Reference 1  Summary of Past and Continuing Studies and Reports

In the first year, members were asked to provide an annotated summary of past and continuing studies examining cumulative environmental impacts.  Information on specific studies was submitted by Argentina, ASOC, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Terms of Reference 2  Coordinating and Conducting Future Studies on Human Impacts

The ICG was tasked with advising on how future studies on human impacts could be coordinated and conducted, including the roles that SCAR, COMNAP, CCAMLR, and IAATO, ASOC and other non-governmental organizations might play.  It was noted that a number of organizations either have or have access to a substantial amount of data that could be of relevance to any studies of cumulative impacts.  For example: COMNAP’s members hold various data sets relating to station operations; CCAMLR has a great deal of data on marine resources; and IAATO collects information annually on tourist numbers and visit locations.  The group, however, had no specific suggestions on the roles the various groups should play.  

There were some suggestions on options for coordinating studies.  The group was asked to comment on the suggestion from the workshop on Cumulative Environmental Impacts of Commercial Ship-Based Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula Area held in June 2000 that it might be useful to establish an independent steering group made up of appropriate experts to assist in scoping of, implementing, and overseeing necessary actions.  One commenter noted that it seemed to be a good idea but that it might be necessary to set up multiple groups or focus any steering groups efforts according to different regions to be studied.  It was suggested that different areas of Antarctica (e.g., the peninsula, East Antarctica, Dronning Maud Land) might require different participants or different approaches.  IAATO indicated be interested in chairing a group if there was interest or value in doing so relative to tourism related issues or typical tourist landing sites

Another suggestion for coordinating efforts was the development of a comprehensive database which would combine data currently held by a number of entities.  It was also suggested that visit reports from national programs for visits by scientific and support personnel would be a useful addition to the data being tracked.  Currently only visits by tourists are being recorded.  

Three possible approaches were suggested to the group as ways of conducting studies that are relevant to cumulative impacts, and the group was asked to comment on them as well as suggest any other options or approaches that might be useful.  They are:

    1. Joint funding and conduct of studies between national programs  
    2. National programs conduct studies separately but on same priority topics; synthesize and analyze data together.
    3. Conduct research separately in generally common priority areas; share results but no synthesis/analysis of data.

One respondent considered all three very feasible.  Another suggested that there was a need for better coordination between the research communities and the tourism industry in conducting work.  This was seen as being of mutual benefit and possibly providing a better focus for some of the research activities. 

In response to the question as to whether there might be types of research better managed by a particular approach, one respondent suggested that long term monitoring programs such as those being conducted on Gentoo trends and Palmer area Adelie studies as well as the Antarctic Site Inventory are important studies to continue, regardless of the particular approach used to accomplish them.

Terms of Reference 3  Priorities for Future Studies

The ICG was asked to identify general needs for future work.  A number of needs were identified and some specific activities to help meet those needs were proposed for the group to comment on.  Table 2 provides a summary.

Table 2.  Priorities for Future Studies

GENERAL NEEDS
SUGGESTED SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES
    1. Documentation of past and present activities to facilitate environmental monitoring; monitoring human activities
        ◦ Establishment of databases (spreadsheets, GIS) capturing field and station activities through time.
        ◦ Recording and reporting on specific parameters (i.e. as suggested by COMNAP Guidelines)
    2. Improving exchange of information 
        ◦ Centralize source of information (CEP website)
        ◦ Informal exchange of information (e.g. cumulative impacts list-serve, COMNAP)
        ◦ Improvement of access to information (national program websites)
    3. Understanding environmental impact processes
        ◦ Long-term environmental studies on environmental response to human activities (i.e. impacts to avian communities in areas where human visitation occurs).
        ◦ Large-scale ecosystem   
    4. Determining mechanisms such as pathways and processes by which impacts accumulate

    5. Identifying the parameters that must be researched or monitored when examining the cumulative aspects of different activities
        ◦ Review of past and ongoing studies that have been effective for understanding cumulative impacts
        ◦ Review of parameters from COMNAP guidelines
        ◦ Gap analysis
    6. Determining the “footprint” of human impact for multiple activities and operators
    • Local, regional or continent-wide monitoring and reporting.
        ◦ Development of databases
    7. Overall, a better understanding is necessary regarding what cumulative impact means over time and space
        ◦ Building long-term data sets.
        ◦ Geospacial data sets (i.e. GIS).
        ◦ Summary and analysis of impacts data over time and space.
One respondent suggested that there was a need to focus on sites that tourists visit regularly and that it would be helpful to identify appropriate indicator species to assist in determining which organisms were most vulnerable or most subject to impacts from human presence.  

Another respondent proposed that the baselines studies should be conducted in pristine areas that are near stations and which have characteristics similar to those of the locations where the stations are built.  The same respondent also suggested that Parties should be conducting baseline studies prior to the establishment of new stations so that trend analyses can be conducted.  Another suggestion was that some areas heavily visited by tourists be identified where some comparable parameters existed and that monitoring activities be undertaken in those areas.  It was also suggested that designating some areas as ASPAs for the purpose of side by side comparative studies where tourist would be allowed in one area but not in another with similar habitat might encourage more interest in monitoring activities. 

With respect to the question of priorities for study and if there are areas or needs that stand out as higher priority areas, it was suggested that some kind of organized database was a very high priority but that the data would need to include information about all visits to sites, not just the information provided by tour operators.  An identified but unresolved issue was that of who would maintain such a data base and how such an activity would be managed and supported.

Conclusions

It is clear that there is great interest in the issue of cumulative environmental impacts.  Many studies have been done that support an understanding of possible impacts from activities or the development of the baseline information needed to evaluate impacts from human activities.  

Basic Information and Data Management  There is agreement on the need for more information from all visits to areas of interest.  Tour operators are currently providing that information in the post visit site reports, but visits by scientists and national program support personnel are not being tracked.  Further, there is agreement on the value of making all this data available, though there is recognition that maintaining any database will require commitment and resources.

Thus two specific suggestions are put forward:
    • Parties should maintain information on visits to areas similar to that maintained in site visit reports for tourist activities to provide a complete data set of visits and activities to areas of concern.
    • Development and maintenance of a database or databases with information on site visitation and other relevant data should be encouraged.  The information in the databases should be readily accessible.

Conducting Research  All three options for conducting research relevant to cumulative impacts are viable: joint funding and conduct of studies; parallel studies with synthesis of data; separate studies with sharing of data.  

Coordination of Studies  While there was some agreement that better coordination was important, there were no specific suggestions on mechanisms to coordinate cumulative impact studies.  IAATO suggested it would be helpful if a national program were doing work in the typically visited tourist sites could provide IAATO with any observations or information on the study areas so that tour operators could understand, avoid or be respectful of the work being done. 

Priorities for Future Studies  One area of emphasis that was agreed is the study of disturbed versus undisturbed areas.
    • Parties should be encouraged to support baseline studies of comparable sites with different levels of visitation (pristine versus highly visited).  These sites could be near stations or in areas frequently visited by tourists.
    • Sites heavily visited by tourists should be studied with a research design intended to assess the impact of visitation (go/no-go area studies similar to those that have been conducted by Australia, Argentina and the United States).

1. Title of the research/monitoring program:
Trace elements monitoring in the coastal ecosystem at the Potter Cove, King George Island, Antarctica

Key words: trace elements, heavy metals, biota, Antarctica, bio-indicators. 

Name and Institutional affiliation of the principal investigators: 
Leopoldo Cristian Vodopivez (cristianvz@dna.gov.ar ), Environmental Chemistry Area, Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) and Patricia Smichowski, Unit of Chemical Activity, Comisión Nacional de Energía Atómica (CNEA), Argentina.

Objectives
To establish levels of trace elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb) and oligo-elements (Fe, Mn) in particulate matter entering Potter Cover, as well as in its marine sediments and coastal biota. 
To identify species that can be used as biological indicators of trace elements in coastal environments.  
To determine the occurrence of bio-accumulation and bio-magnification. 
To assess the bio-geochemical cycles of the considered elements. 

Project Design or Methodology

a. Sampling of abiotic matrixes 

Sediments: Shallow marine sediments  (20 cm) will be collected using sediment traps to be placed through autonomous diving. Three transects, perpendicular to the coast of Jubany station, will be done. Sampling will be done annually, at three depths: 10, 20 and 30 m.  Sampling of particulate matter on creeks will be coordinated with other projects 
Samples from traps will be collected once a fortnight in summer (December to March), and once a month, during the rest of the year.  
Samples will be dried or liophilized, divided into fractions, and analysed according to grain size distribution, content of organic matter, as well as content of major components (Fe, Mn) and trace elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn).

b. Sampling of biotic matrixes 

Benthic organisms (marine webseeds and bivalves):  Sampling will be undertaken by divers, manually at depths between 10 and 25m. 
Intertidal organisms: Sampling will be undertaken manually during low tide. 
Fish:  Samples will be provided by the Ichthyology group of the IAA. 
Birds and mammals:  Samples will be provided by other groups of the IAA working on them. Alternatively dead bodies with no sign of de-composition will be collected.   Samples will be dissected in selected tissues (mollusks: muscles, digestive glandule, kidney and gonads; fishes: muscles, liver, kidney and gonads) and later liophilized and stored in hermetic containers, after acid washing, until they are analysed. 

c. Analysis of abiotic matrixes: 

Samples, once dried or liophilized, will be treated with nitric acid in microwave digestor until total dissolution occurs.  Quantification by atomic absorption spectrometry on flame (FAAS) or atomic absorption spectrometry on plasm (ICP-AES).  Accuracy will be tested against certificated reference material (CRM) MURST ISS A 1 (Antarctic Sediment) provided by the Istituto Superiore di Sanitá, Roma (Italy). In case human-made inputs of trace elements are suspected (or verified)*, complementary analysis over grain sizes smaller than 63 µm will be conducted, which is usually recommended for this kind of analysis.

Seventy five annual samples will be processed in this way. Twenty seven sediment samples (nine triplicate samples), eight triplicate fortnightly-trap sediments, and eight triplicate monthly-trap sediments (48 samples). Samples will be analysed in the Laboratorio de Rocas, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (University of Buenos Aires).

*information to be provided by the Projects: "Hidrología Superficial y Subterránea (HSS)" and "Cambio Global (CG)", which will provide with information on the water dynamics, water chemistry, and geochemistry of Potter Cove. HSS will also evaluate human disturbance on marine and freshwater systems. 

d. Analysis of biotic matrixes: 

Samples, once dried or liophilized, will be treated with nitric acid in microwave digestor until total dissolution occurs. Quantification by atomic absorption spectrometry on flame (FAAS) or by using graphite ovens (GF AAS). Accuracy will be tested against certificated reference material (CRM) MURST ISS A 1 (Antarctic Sediment) provided by the Istituto Superiore di Sanitá, Roma (Italy).
Forty samples of Laternula elliptica will be analysed as follows: 4 by size-range, 10 by size, 4 by tissues (muscles, digestive glandule, kidney and gonads). Total number of analyses: 160. 
Forty samples of Notothenia coriiceps (20 males y 20 females), 4 tissues (muscles, liver, kidney and gonads) , Total number of analysis: 160. Complementarily, samples of macro webseeds, amphipods, birds and mammals will be also analysed. Analysis will be conducted by the Servicio de Hidrografía Naval.

2. Title of the research/monitoring program:
Superficial and Groundwater Hydrology of Potter Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica): Assessment of human inputs. 

Key words: Hydrology, Hydrogeology, Environmental, Contamination, Monitoring, Antarctica.

Name and Institutional affiliation of the principal investigators: 
Leopoldo Cristian Vodopivez (cristianvz@dna.gov.ar ), Environmental Chemistry Area, Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) and Mirta Elida Fresina (fresina@tango.gl.fcen.uba.ar ) , Departamento de Ciencias Geológicas, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Objectives
To propose a behaviour model of superficial and groundwater systems in Potter Peninsula, through the determination of the dynamics of the superficial and groundwater systems, their hydrochemical characterization as well as the identification of likely sources of human disturbance, so as to allow monitoring water quality and predicting likely behaviour of contaminants. 

Project Design or Methodology
The methodology proposed includes three successive stages:  Data inventory, Sampling Procedure and Lab analysis. 

1. Data Inventory:
Bibliography and Cartography 
Photo interpretation and Mapping 
Description of human activities in the area
 
2. Measurement of key parameters (piezometric levels, waterflows, electric conductivity, temperature, pH, etc) and construction of geoelectrical profiles.  An array of gauges will be built in order to sample water on selected stations, so as to measure key parameters in situ. In addition, geoelectrical soundings will be done so as to define permafrost position and structure of the active layer. 

There will be different procedures to obtain samples of soils, superficial water and ground water, depending on the nature of both the sample (soils or water) and the objective (hydrocarbon and metals).

Determination of metal occurrence on soils: samples of 250-500g will be taken at depths between 0.2 y 0.4 m, and stored in high-density polyethylene bags at a temperature of –20 ºC.
Determination of total hydrocarbon content on soils: samples of 250-500g will be taken at depths between 0.2 y 0.4 m, wrapped up in aluminum paper (previously dehydrated at 500º C and washed up in n-hexane) and stored at -20ºC. 

Determination of major and trace elements on water: three samples of both superficial and ground water will be collected in low-density polyethylene bottles, which have to be previously washed up in nitric acid. 

One sample will be used for in situ determinations (pH, conductivity, carbonates, nitrates), another one for determination of major elements (stored at 4ºC), and the last one to determine trace elements (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn). The sample is to be filtered, using a 0.45 mm membrane, and then acidified up to pH < 2. Lastly, it is stored at 4ºC. 

Determination of total hydrocarbon content on water: two samples (one liter each) of both superficial and ground water will be collected in brown glass bottles, which have to be previously washed up in n-hexane. Extracts will be obtained using Freon 113 (or distilled carbon tetrachloride) and stored in brown glass containers, washed up in n-hexane, at 4 ºC. 


3. Lab analysis:
As for the sampling procedures, different techniques will be used to analyse samples of soils, superficial water and ground water, depending on the nature of both the sample (soils or water) and the objective (hydrocarbon and metals).

Determination of metal occurrence on soils: Samples will be digested with nitric acid or using a microwave digestor. Obtained extracts will be analysed using either atomic absorption spectrometry on flame (FAAS) or graphite ovens (GF AAS), according to EPA standards. 

Determination of total hydrocarbon content on soils: Samples will be extracted using either Freon 113 or Carbon tetrachloride, through a process of ultrasonic baths, and quantified using infrared spectrometry according to according to EPA standards.

Determination of metal occurrence on water: Samples will be digested with nitric acid or using a microwave digestor. Obtained extracts will be analysed using either atomic absorption spectrometry on flame (FAAS) or graphite ovens (GF AAS), according to EPA standards.

Determination of total hydrocarbon content on water: Extracts will be quantified using infrared spectrometry according to according to EPA standards. To validate accuracy of metal analysis in soils and water, a technique called Standard Addition will be used. 

When and where the project were or will be conducted

3. Title of the research/monitoring program:
Environmental review of Argentine Activities in Marambio Station 

Keywords: Antarctica, Environmental Impact, Environmental Management, Geographic Information System

Name and Institutional affiliation of the principal investigators: 
José María Acero (jmacero@dna.gov.ar or jmacero@abaconet.com.ar ), Environmental Management Program, Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA).

Objectives
To identify areas exposed to anthropogenic disturbance 
To allow detection and characterization of human-induced environmental impacts 
To assess impact relevance 
To propose sound environmental management guidelines as well as monitoring recommendations, so as to help improving the environmental situation of Marambio Station. 

Project Design or Methodology
Information was collected from previous technical reports, interviews and fieldwork, and organized as thematic maps encompassing diverse environmental features and station activities. Complete databases are associated with each map. Data collection and its subsequent analysis were made on two scale: 1:1000 and 1:10000. 

Thematic maps were processed using different tools of spatial analysis.  Identification of environmental values exposed to human disturbance was achieved through a thematic overlaying, whose results were summarized as double-entry matrices. Geographic Information Systems were used to  combine different layers of information. Qualitative criteria were then applied, which allowed determining the degree of exposure of each environmental value, at both scales. Environmental impacts were characterized taking into account their nature, duration and spatial extent. In order to estimate impact magnitudes, the environmental criterion applied in the present study has put more emphasis on duration of environmental changes rather than on their spatial extent, since reversibility has been considered the main indicator of modifications to the environment.

Finally, and as a result of data integration, main environmental problems associated to Marambio station activities were identified, and mitigation measures as well as monitoring guidelines were proposed.

Advice, commentary and review was provided through all stages of the monitoring process by scientists in several institutions worldwide. 

Greenpeace International provided funding and logistics for the monitoring program, except for the 1995/96 season in which logistic support was provided by the New Zealand Antarctic Program—NZAP.    

Project objectives
The project overall objective was to determine the main physical, chemical and biological changes that the presence of World Park Base had caused at Cape Evans.  Specific objectives included the assessment and monitoring of:
    • Physical degradation of freezing ground;
    • Hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination on freezing ground, fresh water and the coastal environment; 
    • Hydrocarbon dispersal;
    • Effectiveness of remediation procedures;
    • Changes to microbial populations in spill sites;
    • Presence of anthropogenic matter in skua pellets.

Project design or methodology
Different aspects of the project used different methodologies to assess physical, chemical and biological impacts (Greenpeace 1993; Harper 1996, Roura 1996).  

A detailed geomorphological survey of the area was carried out.  Some physical properties of the freezing ground were measured on site. Surface spill sites were located, demarcated and mapped using visual, olfactory and tactile tests.  Samples of soils, sediments and water from freshwater and marine sources were taken randomly and at specific locations within the base area, as appropriate, as well as control sites elsewhere. Sampling sites were established at the ex-base site (range 1-100m), in different locations of Cape Evans (range 100-800m), and in nearby Cape Barne (8km away). Samples were analyzed for hydrocarbons and heavy metals, and relevant physical properties.

Repeated sampling of relevant matrixes took place through the various monitoring seasons through an iteration of data collection and analysis.  Earlier monitoring results were used to focus later studies.  The initial footprint study covered several aspects of human impact.  Follow up monitoring focused on testing hydrocarbon dispersal within the ex-base site and the effectiveness of remediation procedures. It also evaluated hydrocarbon and heavy metal content in soils and lake water and sediments over the entire ice-free area of Cape Evans, and the presence of anthropogenic matter in skua pellets.

When and where the project(s) were or will be conducted

World Park Base (WPB) was located at Cape Evans (77o 38’S, 166o 24’E), the southernmost of the three ice-free coastal areas west of Mt. Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica. 

WPB was built at the site of the former Footsteps of Scott Expedition base camp (1984-1986).  This site was located about two hundred meters to the NE of Scott’s hut (1910-1913 and 1915-1917) and several hundred meters to the NE of two small huts maintained by Antarctica New Zealand since the 1980’s.  

The four-person base operated year-round and was resupplied annually by Greenpeace ships.  

WPB was entirely removed in January/February 1992 and a baseline impact study carried out (Greenpeace 1993). Follow up monitoring was carried out in the 1992/93 and 1995/96 seasons.  

The relevant preliminary or final results of any projects that have thus far produced results.
The presence and operation of Greenpeace’s World Park Base mainly affected the terrestrial environment, primarily in the form of localized contamination by hydrocarbons and heavy metals, localized physical degradation of the permafrost terrain, and extended physical deny of space to wildlife (mostly skuas Catharacta sp.)

Hydrocarbon contaminated ground affecting about 110 m2 were found in areas subject to fuel use or storage (e.g. engine room, fuel rack).  An additional contaminated site was found further downhill from spill sites.  Levels of lead, chromium, zinc and copper were much elevated in spill sites than in the control area.  Hydrocarbon concentration a short distance away from identified spill sites was generally low or non detectable.  No general widespread hydrocarbon contamination was found.  Hydrocarbon contamination was not detectable on lake water, meltwater pools, or marine water.

Under 200 liter of fuel (130-180 liters) were estimated to be present in the ground when WPB was removed.  This represents about 0.1% of the approximately 160,000 liters of fuel used at WPB between 1986 and 1991.  Low impact, low technology remedial action in 1992 removed about 75% of the fuel present in the ground.  The remediation had an impact of its own but it prevented or minimized secondary impacts.

Some physical impacts were temporary (e.g. changes to snow deposition patterns and snow drift development) whilst others were more permanent (e.g. excavations that were later backfilled).  To date these impacts have not triggered permafrost degradation processes,2 which would have resulted in a variety of features e.g. depressions on the ground surface.

Anecdotal (and some systematic) observations in later visits confirmed that wildlife was reoccupying the site in larger numbers than what was apparent at the time of the operation of the base.  

The impact of WPB was arguably less than minor—sensu Protocol—albeit all impacts contribute to the degradation of natural values.  Hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination of the freezing ground, with potential effects on the soil meso- and microbiota, and of exposing wildlife to the contact with contaminated ground are considered to cause the more significant lasting effects.  Hydrocarbon contaminated sites are contained within specific locations of the former base site.

1. Title of research or monitoring: 
Monitoring for long-term or cumulative impacts in Southern Ocean seabirds e.g. impacts of human visitors on breeding success and long-term population trends in Adelie Penguins at Casey

Name and institutional affiliation of the principal investigator: 
AAD

Objectives of the project: 
Establish baseline information on the current distribution and abundance of seabirds in the AAT and on Heard Island, using contemporary and historical data. Establish appropriate methods to monitor seabird populations, and establish a network of monitored seabird colonies throughout the AAT and Heard Island with a view to establishing population trends. For example, behavioural and ecological studies of Adelie Penguins at two locations to assess the impact of human visitation upon breeding success.

Project design or methodology: 
Collect data on all breeding species. Assess breeding population trends at a variety of localities and integrate population data from multiple species/locations.  For example, examined population figures over 40 years at Whitney Point and Shirley Island, looking at both recent breeding success data and long-term population trends of Adelie Penguin. This allows for the assessment of impact of human visitation, as well as providing a baseline for subsequent studies examining future changes in populations. A comparison was made between an area with visits by expeditioners and an area that requires entry by permit. Changes over time of breeding numbers were also examined along with increased use for scientific and recreation purposes. 

When and where the project was or will be conducted: 
Data has been collected from Heard Island and Casey, with potential for future collection at Mawson and return visits to Casey and Heard Island.

Relevant preliminary or final results: 
Preliminary results from Casey indicate, human visitors to Shirley Island from Casey Station are believed to be responsible for the observed changes in the distribution and abundance of breeding pairs and for maintaining the stable population by reducing the overall breeding success through the disturbance associated with visits.


2. Title of research or monitoring: 
Long term population trends in Southern Giant Petrels in East Antarctica

Name and institutional affiliation of the principal investigator: 
AAD

Objectives of the project: 
Document population trends of the three known breeding populations of southern giant petrels in the AAT and describe a management approach to ensure recovery of the breeding population.
Project design or methodology: Census data were compiled from station logs, banding schedules, published accounts and field data. Population trends were assessed. An analysis of population trends was studied together with potential impacts (such as disturbance) and the timing of those impacts. 
When and where the project was or will be conducted: Frasier Island (near Casey), Hawker Island (near Davis) and Giganteus Island (near Mawson), East Antarctica. Station log data goes back to 1956 (Giganteus Island), with census data compiled until 2000/2001.

Relevant preliminary or final results: 
All three breeding populations decreased rapidly following their discovery. Human disturbance to breeding birds at their nest, mainly due to banding for scientific studies, is believed to be the primary factor causing these decreases.


3. Title of research or monitoring: 
Development and utilisation of an automated Penguin recording system in the CCAMLR ecosystem monitoring program. 

Name and institutional affiliation of the principal investigator: 
AAD

Objectives of the project: 
Gather penguin weight data in the study of population dynamics, breeding biology and foraging ecology of the Adelie penguin. Monitor these parameters with the objective of detecting variability in the marine system and attributing any detected change to natural or man made (harvesting) causes. 

Project design or methodology: 
An automated penguin monitoring system is used to gather data penguin weight, length, population size, demography, duration of foraging trips, breeding success, fledgling weight, diet, and breeding chronology. In addition, a study of foraging ecology is conducted. An evaluation of the performance of birds carrying scientific packages or bands is conducted, in relation to foraging trip duration, breeding success, and mortality.

When and where the project was or will be conducted: 
The project has been running since 1990/91. The study site is Bechervaise Island, near Mawson station, East Antarctica.

Relevant preliminary or final results: 
Results from each year can be used to determine the breeding and foraging success of that season. In addition, results of the scientific impact on the birds show that banding of penguins and studies of foraging duration using externally attached devices should take into consideration the potential adverse effects of the techniques used. Steps should be taken to minimise these by considering alternative procedures to flipper banding and by streamlining packages as much as possible. Stomach lavage of birds with chicks appears not to affect reproductive success when only carried out only once per nest. Care must be taken to minimise stress and damage to individual birds.


4. Title of research or monitoring: 
Monitoring of clean-up of Antarctic waste dumps.

Name and institutional affiliation of the principal investigator: 
AAD

Objectives of the project: 
Provide information to direct operations, to detect adverse environmental impacts that may be caused by the clean-up and to determine whether the clean-up has created a long-term environmental benefit. 

Project design or methodology: 
The project includes three timescales of monitoring. In the short-term, monitoring will provide real-time information to direct the clean-up operation as it progresses. Chemical monitoring using field-portable techniques will be used to measure contaminants in run-off so that excavation techniques can be modified if necessary. Amphipod crustaceans will be used as biological sentinels to continually sample water from Brown Bay near the tip to monitor levels of contaminants. In the medium-term, several methods will be used to determine whether the clean-up was undertaken without creating additional environmental impacts. Sediment traps will be used to compare the amount of contamination carried into the Sea before, during and after the clean-up. The sentinel amphipods will also be analysed for contaminants. In addition, experiments have been deployed to determine whether recruitment of sediment-living animals change as a consequence of clean-up. In the long term, monitoring will determine whether removing the tip allows recovery of the depauperate benthic communities in the adjacent bay. Monitoring on the three timescales will allow assessment of how serious the impacts are and how long they will last. 

When and where the project was or will be conducted: 
The project will be monitored over a time period of approximately 8 years, in Thala Valley and Brown Bay, near Casey Station, East Antarctica.

Relevant preliminary or final results: 
Heavy metal contaminants known to be highly toxic when present at elevated levels in aquatic ecosystems are present at Brown Bay. The heavy metals and organic compounds found in Brown Bay are known to be persistent in the environment, and fast natural attenuation is not expected. Marine life in Brown Bay, adjacent to the tip, is very different from that at other locations in the vicinity of Casey. Human activity is the most probable cause of these differences.


5. Monitoring Databases

In addition to the aforementioned projects, the AAD has a number of monitoring databases that do not specifically target the study of cumulative impact, but that can be manipulated to provide information that will assist in the study of cumulative impact. 

First, the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) is in the process of cataloguing data sets over time for AAD scientific activities. Within this catalogue, human impacts on the environment are documented, although not necessarily studied in a specific project related to cumulative impact. For example, the State of the Environment reporting system known as the System for Indicator Management and Reporting contains condition, pressure and response indicators relating to the environment. The three types of indicators describe the condition of important elements of a system; show the extent of the major pressures exerted on a system; and determine responses to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.

Secondly, the Antarctic Treaty (Environmental Protection) Act 1980 (ATEP) Permit system database collects information of all specimens from the Antarctic and all Australian activities within Protected Areas. Thirdly, an Environmental Impact Assessment database is being established to collate preliminary assessment and initial environmental evaluation information, relating to every Australian activity that takes place in Antarctica.

1. Title: 	Environmental Database of New Zealand Antarctic National Programme Activities

Institution:	New Zealand Antarctic Institute (Antarctica New Zealand)

Objectives:	Collecting good information about human activities in Antarctica is an essential part of sound environmental management and a first important step in trying to identify and assess areas of potential cumulative impacts.  Since 1997 Antarctica New Zealand has been developing an environmental database which aims to provide easily accessible information about the activities it supports in Antarctica and their associated impacts.

Project Design: The database records the movements and activities of New Zealand science and operational events in Antarctica.  The main geographical area covered is Ross Island and the adjacent coast and mountain ranges. Over time this information will help to build up a picture of site usage, highlighting areas that are highly impacted, sites that are rarely visited as well as other information which can contribute to planning and management.  Records are also kept of all authorisations (permits) issued (e.g. for entry to protected area and biological and geological sampling). The database allows for searching, sorting and reporting the information in a variety of ways. Examples of queries that could easily be answered include:
    • How many parties have carried out certain activities or types of research, e.g. sampled vegetation at a specific site, e.g. Canada Glacier SSSI 12, in the last decade?
    • Which protected areas were entered last season and by how many people?
    • Which sites received the most visitors in a given time period, e.g. last season or in the last decade?  

Timing: 	The time span of the data in the database is from the 1950s to the present day.

Results:	The database currently holds information on New Zealand supported visits to over 4200 sites in the Ross Sea region by over 1300 parties.  The data can be sorted to provide a variety of site-specific information that gives an indication of locations where cumulative impacts may be an issue and warrant further on-site investigation and/or closer site management.  An example of the type of information that can be extracted from the database is set out below.  In this example, all database records (except Scott Base) are sorted first in order of total days a site has been occupied and secondly by total person days.  The top the top 10 sites in the Ross Sea region presented in each example.  This data allows a comparison of intensity and duration of site use.  A limitation of the data is that it only captures New Zealand site use and activity and not other visitors to these sites.

2. Title:	Environmental Monitoring Programme for the Cape Roberts Scientific Drilling Project

Institution:	New Zealand Antarctic Institute (Antarctica New Zealand)

Objectives:	The Cape Roberts Project was a seven nation multi-year scientific drilling programme which recovered sedimentary core beneath the sea floor off Cape Roberts in the southern Ross Sea.  An important aspect of the environment management for the project was the implementation of a comprehensive monitoring programme.  As the project was carried out at sites of previous activity, and was conducted over a 6 season time frame, cumulative environmental impacts were identified as an issue in the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) written for the project.  The aim of the monitoring programme was to verify whether the impacts of activities were as presented in the CEE, as well as to identify any unforeseen impacts, especially those of a cumulative nature.

Project Design: Specific environmental parameters to be monitored throughout the project were selected and data collected every season.  Key parameters related to waste, flora, skua breeding, surface disturbance, soil contamination, and impacts on benthic communities.  Specific objectives, indicators and techniques, and detailed methodologies were developed for each parameter.  Results were examined each season, including within season if certain environmental limits were approached.  A range of tools were incorporated into the monitoring programme including record keeping, photo- and video-monitoring, population surveys and direct sampling.

Timing:	Throughout every season from 1995/96 to 2001/02.

Results:	The results and conclusions from the monitoring programme have been collated and are included in Waterhouse (2001)3.  


3. Title:	Scott Base Environmental Monitoring Programme

Institution:	New Zealand Antarctic Institute (Antarctica New Zealand)

Objectives:	To determine the extent and intensity of the impact of Scott Base operations on the local Pram Point environment, including any incremental and/or cumulative changes.  Data and information from the monitoring programme feeds directly into management decision processes.

Project Design: Monitoring of several key parameters on Pram Point associated with the ongoing operation of Scott Base including: change in the terrestrial environment – this work includes fixed point photo-monitoring sites where a fixed view is photographed each season with the aim to detect and record changes over time in the topography, facilities, and other features of the Scott Base environment; the detailed recording and mapping of fuel spills with sample collection as appropriate. 

Timing:	Photo-monitoring and detailed fuel spill mapping since 1994.
	
Results:	Detailed 10 year analysis of photo-monitoring records due in 2004.  Preliminary analysis has identified changes over smaller time periods not necessarily evident year by year.

1. Title of the research or monitoring project:
Rothera Research Station (UK) - Long-term Environmental Monitoring Project

Name and institutional affiliations of the principal investigators:
British Antarctic Survey
Contact: Dr John Shears, Environmental Officer, British Antarctic Survey

Objectives of the project:

To identify and assess the long-term impacts of Rothera Research Station (UK) on the local environment, and to check predictions made in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for activities undertaken there.

Project design and methodology
Current studies involve the monitoring of several key environmental indicators found on or around Rothera Point. 
Terrestrial
Survey of the surface of the ice ramp
Analysis of heavy metals in lichens (Usnea spp.) 
Analysis of hydrocarbons in soils, particularly after major fuel spills
Marine
Analysis of heavy metals in marine clams (Laternula elliptica)
Survey of sewage contamination 
Birds
Survey of the distribution, numbers and breeding success of nesting skuas 
(Catharacta spp.) and Dominican gulls (Larus dominicanus)

The terrestrial and bird studies use the northeastern part of Rothera Point as an undisturbed control area in assessing the environmental impact of the research station. Since 1985, this area has been protected as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 9. It is also a terrestrial biology research site.

When and where the project was or will be conducted
The long-term environmental monitoring project began at Rothera Point in 1975, before the research station was established by BAS in 1976. Monitoring was enhanced before, and after, the construction of the crushed rock airstrip at Rothera in 1989/90. The most recent addition to the monitoring programme is the survey of sewage contamination of North Cove, Rothera Point, which began in 1999/2000.

Relevant preliminary or final results
Long-term environmental monitoring at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, has shown that the research station has had a significant effect on the local environment, but that actual impacts have been less serious than predicted. 

The initial establishment of the station was probably responsible for the disappearance of a small colony of nesting terns (60 – 100 birds). However, the local breeding population of skuas and Dominican gulls has remained fairly stable, but with very variable breeding success.

Dust pollution from the airstrip has probably not been a major contributory factor in the melting of the ice ramp leading up to the Wormald Ice Piedmont. Instead, it is thought that melting is due to regional climate warming, which is affecting the whole of the Antarctic Peninsula. 

Monitoring of heavy metals in lichens has shown that lead and zinc levels show a significant decrease with distance away from the station and airstrip. Background levels are now found 1 km away from the station. Elevated levels of copper have been found in clams collected from the seabed near the northern end of the airstrip. The most probable sources of these contaminants are emissions from aircraft and vehicle activity and the station power generators.

Monitoring of sewage pollution in North Cove has shown that faecal bacteria (e.g. E. coli and Salmonella ) can survive and spread from the discharge point within North Cove, though there is no evidence of sewage contamination outside this area.  Bacterial spread is predominantly along the shoreline, presumably due to local currents. During the summer, high UVB radiation results in reduced survival of coliform bacteria. In winter, sea-ice stops UVB penetrating the water column and breaking down the bacteria, and also reduces the local currents. Seeds, including tomato and coriander, have also been identified in skua pellets collected at Rothera Point. This was probably due to birds (e.g. Skuas) feeding on the sewage effluent. Further research has shown that detergents discharged in the sewage outfall are slow to break down in the Antarctic marine environment. A sewage treatment plant is currently being built at Rothera, and will start operating at the end of 2002/03.

Title		Oil spillage in Antarctica
Author		Kennicutt, M.C., II; et al
Source		Environmental science & technology, 24(5), p.620‑624. United States
Publication Date	May 1990
Abstract	
This item is the initial report of the NSF‑sponsored Quick Response Team on the grounding of the Bahia Paraiso near Anvers I. on Jan. 28, 1989. The immediate effects of the spill were restricted to within a few kilometers of the wreck over a several‑week period due to reduction in leakage, cleanup, weathering of the spill, and flushing of the area. The intertidal zone was most directly affected with oil‑fouled macroalgae, limpets, birds, sediments, and rocks. Little sediment is present in the study area, and most beaches are composed of pebble‑sized or larger rocks, which provide few places for the slick to concentrate away from wave and wind action. This setting prevents the oil from permanently depositing on the islands, except on beaches and above the surf zone, and ultimately results in evaporation, transport from the area, and dilution of the slick. The simultaneity of several factors contributed to limiting the impact of the spill both areally and over time. These factors include the volatility of the released product, the volume of material released, the variable and severe weather conditions, the common occurrence of off‑shore winds and currents, and the lack of low‑energy intertidal areas for the fuel to accumulate. The primary removal mechanisms were evaporation, dilution, and transport from the area, with only minor effects from microbial oxidation, photo-oxidation, and biological uptake. Longer term sublethal effects have yet to be documented, but appear to be limited to limpet and bird population dynamics if any can be recognized at all.

Title	Examination of potential hearing damage in Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli) in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica
Author	Bohne, B.A.; Thomas, J.A.; Yohe, E.R.; Stone, S.H.; et al
Source	Antarctic Journal of the United States, 20(5), p.174‑176. United States
Publication Date	1985
Abstract	
The objective of this study was to assess impacts of manmade noise in McMurdo Sound by examining the inner ears of Weddell seals for possible noise‑induced loss of sensory cells. Results have worldwide application to the question of whether manmade noise adversely affects marine mammals. During the 1984‑1985 austral summer, there were at least 80 dynamite explosions in McMurdo Sound (26 above water and 54 through sea ice), made by the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In Jan. 1985, 25 Weddell seals taken from the east and west sides of McMurdo Sound were sacrificed. A total of 18 cochleas were transported in Tyrode's solution to Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, Missouri, for analysis using techniques by Bohne (1972). The final dissection and analysis of the inner ears collected during this study will be undertaken in a separate study. Results will provide information on damage to the peripheral auditory system of Weddell seals.

Abstract	
The authors present their calculations for the fossil fuel burning fluxes of particulate carbon and nitrogen from scientific activity in Taylor Valley, Antarctica for the 1997‑1998 field season, with the ultimate goal of establishing the patterns and controls of organic matter within the landscape as well as describe the patterns of disturbance (both natural and anthropogenic) to the research site, and to quantify the introduction of carbon and nitrogen to the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Calculations show that the anthropogenic, nongaseous carbon fluxes are relatively insignificant compared to the natural fluxes, while the anthropogenic, NOx flux might have long‑term (over decadal time scales) importance.

This report summarizes results and findings from the first 3 seasons of field work on the Antarctic Site Inventory project, 1994‑1997. Actual field work began in Nov. 1994. The results and findings lead to 5 recommendations pertaining to future assessment and monitoring needs under the 1991 Protocol On Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, correlation studies that improve the usefulness of Antarctic Site Inventory‑type censuses, and improved visit reporting and analysis by tour operators and governments. The raw materials for this report are the data sheets, slide photographs, and sketch maps that were completed taken, and drawn by Antarctic Site Inventory personnel from Nov. 1994 to Feb. 1996. Data, documentary photographs and maps are stored by Oceanites. These results and recommendations are buttressed by 4 appendices.

Title	Background levels of metals in soils, McMurdo Station, Antarctica

Publication Date	May 1998
Abstract	
McMurdo Station is the largest research station in Antarctica, with a population that ranges each year from 250 to 1200 people. Because of its size and 40‑year history of use, a number of locations around the station have become contaminated with wastes. Soils and sediments in these areas have been shown to contain elevated levels of petroleum‑related products, PCBs, other organics and metals. While some remedial investigations have been conducted, background levels of metals in soils have not been determined. This paper reports on background levels of metals in a natural basalt‑derived soil ('gray soil') and scoria (soft porous rock used as fill, 'red soil') near McMurdo Station using two fundamentally different analytical procedures, concentrated acid extraction/analysis and total metals. These data facilitate determining the extent and levels of metal contamination near McMurdo Station and provide reference levels of metals for comparison with existing and future remediation data. There were statistically significant differences between metals concentrations in both gray and red soils, and no correlations between the level of extracted versus total metal. Generally, only a small fraction of a metal was extractable.

Abstract	
This report presents the results of ambient air monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and total oxides of nitrogen (NOx) performed during the final weeks of the 1992‑1993 austral summer in the vicinity of McMurdo Station. Commercially available, high sensitivity ambient air gas analyzers were used to continuously measure gas concentrations at 2 locations over a 2 and a 3 week time period respectively. Sampling site selection, sampling procedures and quality assurance procedures used for this effort were consistent with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for local ambient air quality networks. CO, SO2, and NO2 concentrations measured were below the associated U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The impact on local air quality of ships docked at an ice pier was observed and quantified. The initial baseline effort demonstrated that site selection and sampling equipment performance were satisfactory, and provided useful data for assessing the impact of McMurdo operations on the local ambient air quality.

Abstract	
This report presents the results of ambient air monitoring of particulate matter performed during the 1992‑1993 austral summer in the vicinity of McMurdo Station. Thirty‑three 24‑hour samples were collected from 3 locations for determination of the concentration of particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10), and 7 samples collected for determination of total suspended particulate matter (TSP) concentration. Critical flow high volume air samplers with a sample flow rate of approximately 1.1 m3/min. were used to collect the particulate matter on quartz fiber filters for subsequent gravimetric analysis. Sampling site selection, sampling procedures, and quality assurance procedures used were consistent with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance for local ambient air quality networks. All PM10 results met the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard. TSP results at all locations were greater than PM10 concentrations, ranging from 8 micro‑g/m3 at the upwind location to a maximum measurement of 276 micro‑g/m3 at the "downtown" location. The initial baseline effort demonstrated that site selection and sampling equipment performance were satisfactory, and provided useful data for assessing the impact of McMurdo operations on the local ambient air quality.

Abstract	
This report presents the results of ambient air monitoring for polychlorinated dibenzo‑p‑dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) performed during the 1992‑1993 austral summer in the vicinity of McMurdo Station. Fifteen air samples were collected from 4 different locations for determination of the presence and concentration of PCDD/PCDF compounds. General Metal Works Inc. PS‑1 air samplers equipped with polyurethane foam (PUF) with a sample flow rate of approximately 0.27 m3/min. were used to collect air samples. Sampling site selection, sampling procedures, and quality assurance procedures used were consistent with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance for local ambient air quality networks. PCDD/PCDF compounds were not detected at the predominantly upwind location nor at a more remote site on Black I. Trace levels of only a few PCDD/PCDF congeners were detected sporadically at a location approximately 500 m downwind of the station. The initial baseline effort demonstrated that site selection and sampling equipment performance were satisfactory, provided useful data for assessing the impact of McMurdo operations on the local ambient air quality, and provided baseline data for assessing the antarctic continental air quality.

Abstract	
Enroute to re‑supply an Argentine Antarctic base, the Bahia Paraiso ran aground in Arthur Harbor on January 28, 1989 as it exited the harbor 2 km from Palmer Station, the US research base on Anvers Island. It is estimated that more than 600,000 liters of fuel released into the bay and contaminated surrounding waters. The article discusses short‑term and long‑term effects of the oil spill, especially on the marine life. The study of the aftermath provides important information and clues regarding the course and the ultimate effect of this spill. The study of this event is key to learning how to most appropriately respond to the next event. This event can also serve as a catalyst for positive and constructive change in how we do preserve and protect the environment.

Abstract	
The sinking of the ship, Bahia Paraiso, in the vicinity of Palmer Station in Jan. 1989 resulted in a diesel fuel spill of about 600,000 l. After an initial international effort directed toward rescue of personnel and damage containment, the U.S. National Science Foundation organized a quick‑response team of scientists from the United States, Argentina and Chile to assess the environmental impacts. Initial results showed an immediate negative impact to the rocky intertidal community and to certain seabird species. United States scientists have continued a long‑term monitoring effort which has shown recovery by certain species and long‑term negative effects on others. Continuing fuel leakage from the Bahia Paraiso resulted in a joint fuel recovery effort conducted by The Netherlands and Argentina between Dec. 2, 1992 and Jan. 2, 1993. The application of modern hot tap salvage techniques for the penetration of the submerged tanks and for fuel pumping proved environmentally sound; no disturbance of wildlife was observed.

Abstract	
Williams Field provides logistical support to McMurdo Station and manages large amounts of fuel for their cargo planes. Numerous spills have occurred at this site with little recovery or remediation of the spilled fuel. The spill which happened on Dec. 3, 1993, came from a flexible pipeline midway between McMurdo Station and Williams Field, on the Ross Ice Shelf. A fuel‑line‑connection failure released an estimated 11,400 L of JP‑8 on the ice. Because the fuel that spilled was originally above 0°C, heat transferred into the ice and created two cone‑shaped holes approximately 2 m in diameter and 4 to 5 m deep. No remediation efforts were taken, and the site was marked "off limits." Cores were taken from five holes drilled by the Polar Ice Coring Office using a 10.16 cm drill. The data collected indicate that fuel spilled on an ice shelf will travel almost straight down from the spill site with very little horizontal dispersion until a confining layer of salt‑water‑saturated ice is encountered. At that point, the fuel will move horizontally, spreading out on top of the salt‑water‑saturated layer. The fuel appears to move rather rapidly, with an estimated maximum rate of 0.8 m per day, assuming isotropic conditions.

Abstract	
The Bahia Paraiso ran aground on Jan. 28, 1989, approximately 2 km from Palmer Station. The first evidence of ecological damage was observed in the intertidal zone. Invertebrate mortality, mostly dead and moribund limpets, was observed as early as Feb. 1, with thousands of dead individuals being observed by Feb. 4. The earliest evidence of lethal exposure of sea birds was noted on Feb. 1 when dead, oiled Adélie penguins and blue‑eyed shags were found in Biscoe Bay adjacent to Palmer Station. The mortality rate during the spill was less than 300 individuals over a 3‑week period, with 89% being penguins and shags. One year after the spill several areas exhibited continued contamination due to chronic low‑level leakage from the ship. Subtidal sediments and distant intertidal locations contained no detectable PAH. Exceptions were two beaches on Hermit and Cormorant Is. and limpets in close proximity to the wreck. Two years after the release of DFA into Arthur Harbor, little spill‑related contamination could be detected in intertidal or subtidal limpets.

Abstract	
In Jan. to Mar. 1989 water, organisms, and sediments within a 2‑mile radius of Arthur Harbor were contaminated with an estimated 600,000 L of petroleum spilled by the Bahia Paraiso. All components of the ecosystem were contaminated to varying degrees during the spill, including birds, limpets, macroalgae, clams, bottom‑feeding fish, and sediments. The high‑energy environment, the relatively small volume of material released, and the volatility of the released product all contributed to limiting toxic effects in time and space. The most effective removal processes were evaporation, dilution, winds, and currents. Sedimentation, biological uptake, microbial oxidation, and photooxidation accounted for removal of only a minor portion of the spill. One year after the spill several areas still exhibited contamination. Subtidal sediments and the more distant intertidal locations were devoid of detectable PAH contaminants, whereas sediments near the docking facility at Palmer Station continued to reflect localized nonspill‑related activities in the area. Arthur Harbor and adjacent areas continue to be chronically exposed to low‑level petroleum contamination emanating from the Bahia Paraiso.

Abstract	
Following the Bahia Paraiso oil spill in the vicinity of Palmer Station, an oil spill survey team observed that the principal intertidal alga, Urospora sp., grew abundantly in most offshore facing areas, though it had been reported to have turned brown soon after the spill occurred. Limpets were also found in many areas that had been exposed to oil, though it was estimated that half of the limpets had died during the month after the spill. The cryptic fauna found among a stable boulder field on Bonaparte Point, adjacent to the station, appeared to have been completely destroyed. It is pointed out that the lack of a strong base of quantitative information on the distribution and abundance of intertidal plants and animals prior to the oil spill makes the measurement of any long‑term effects difficult.

Abstract 	
Contaminant inventories, sources, transport and depositional processes, and potential biological impacts along the Antarctic Peninsula are summarized and discussed. The most frequently measured contaminants are hydrocarbons, chlorinated organic compounds and metals. The greatest perturbations of the peninsular environment are related to the presence of humans and are generally local in extent. All stations studied to date exhibit a "halo" of contaminants, primarily hydrocarbons and trace metals. Long distance atmospheric transport of contaminants to Antarctica appears to be a minor input and the resultant concentrations are expected to be far below known thresholds for toxic or lethal biological effects. Measures of biological response, both inducible enzymes and metabolite formation, demonstrate that organisms are being exposed and have responded to this exposure in close proximity to a scientific station in Arthur Harbor, Anvers Island. Based on the available data, the peninsula appears to be relatively pristine and exhibits contaminant accumulation and measurable biological responses in close proximity to human settlements. 

Title	Assessing aromatic hydrocarbon exposure in antarctic fish captured near Palmer and McMurdo Stations, Antarctica

Abstract 
Since little is known about the effects of contaminants on antarctic organisms, the effects of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) on antarctic fish were evaluated. Fish captured near Palmer Station exhibited induced ethoxyresorufin O‑deethylase (EROD) activities and elevated concentrations of biliary PAH metabolites compared to fish from control sites. Naphthalene and phenanthrene PAH metabolite levels were significantly higher in the bile of fish captured near McMurdo Station than in fish from remote sites in McMurdo Sound. Laboratory experiments were conducted in which Notothenia gibberifrons were treated with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and diesel fuel Arctic (DFA). Although DFA is composed primarily of 2‑ and 3‑ring PAH which are not known to be potent CYPIA inducers, the maximal hepatic EROD activity of DFA‑treated fish was approximately 80% of that observed in BaP‑treated fish.

Abstract	
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, and trace metal concentrations in McMurdo Sound and Arthur Harbor sediments and marine biota are reported. Biomarkers of contaminant exposure, biliary metabolites and EROD assays were also measured. Hydrocarbon and trace metal contamination are generally limited to within hundreds of meters of human settlements. Local releases of fossil fuels, disposal of waste materials, and aging of ship and station structures contribute to contamination. High concentrations of PCBs were detected in sediments (250‑4200 ng/g) and organisms (up to 420 ng/g) from Winter Quarters Bay (WQB). Trace metal and PAH sediment concentrations rarely exceed levels known to cause toxic effects in marine organisms, whereas PCBs in WQB often do. Biological responses to exposure include the formation of PAH metabolites and the inducement of the P4501A detoxification system in fish. Induction of EROD activity in «in vitro» rat hepatoma H411E cell bioassays by tissue extracts correlated with known levels of PCB contamination in invertebrate tissues. Local sources of contaminants greatly exceed those attributable to long‑distance atmospheric transport.

Abstract	
PAH exposure was assessed in fish from Arthur Harbor and sites remote from human activities by measuring the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in bile and PAH in tissues and stomach contents. The highest concentrations of biliary metabolites and tissue PAH were present in fish captured near an Argentine supply ship «(Bahia Paraiso)» that ran aground in Arthur Harbor in 1989. The presence of biliary PAH metabolites in fish collected near Palmer Station suggests low‑level exposure to contaminants. However, PAH tissue concentrations in fish from Palmer Station were similar to those from remote sites. Both tissue PAH and metabolite concentrations were low in fish captured at sites remote from human activities. The confirmation of PAH metabolites in the bile of fish from Arthur Harbor is direct evidence that the presence of humans has resulted in antarctic fish being exposed to petroleum‑derived PAH.

Abstract	
Two years after the release of 600,000 l of diesel fuel arctic into Arthur Harbor, little spill‑related contamination can be detected in intertidal limpets (Nacella concinna) and subtidal sediments. Periodic releases of small amounts of material from the ship drift to nearby islands, in particular the intertidal areas of Christine, Limitrophe and Humble Is. Subtidal sediment contamination is primarily due to other local inputs such as ship, boating and station activities. Beaches were unusually contaminated after 2 yrs, but quiescent weather conditions, occasional releases from the wreck, and prevailing currents may concentrate hydrocarbon contamination in relatively low energy areas. Intertidal limpets (N. concinna) collected along these beaches were also contaminated. The volatility of the fluid, the amount spilled, and the dynamic weather and current conditions in Arthur Harbor tended to minimize long‑term contamination of the area.

Abstract	
Accidental and operational releases of hydrocarbons during activities in support of scientific bases in the Antarctic can contaminate organisms in close proximity to these locations. Intertidal and subtidal limpets in Arthur Harbor were found to contain elevated levels of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons near Palmer and Old Palmer Stations. Contamination was highest in the intertidal and decreased with increasing water depth in the subtidal. The highest concentrations of tissue contamination were found in intertidal areas associated with high levels of onshore soil contamination. Limpets (Nacella concinna) preferentially incorporated the more water soluble aromatic compounds, suggesting exposure to dissolved contaminants in run‑off rather than particulates or slicks. This was in contrast to subtidal sediments that were primarily contaminated with freshly spilled diesel fuel. While contamination was present near stations, the concentrations observed are 1‑2 orders of magnitude lower than the initial contamination caused by the Bahia Paraiso diesel fuel spill in 1989.

Abstract	
Near‑field contamination in Arthur Harbor can be traced to spills, ship and boating activities, and run‑off. Soil samples from Palmer Station and Old Palmer Station contain hydrocarbons derived from diesel fuel, lubrication oil, and hydraulic fluid. Most of the contamination in subtidal sediments around Palmer Station is due to diesel fuel spills. Subtidal sediments below an abandoned open incineration site also contain combustion‑derived polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Soils collected at Old Palmer Station were also contaminated with diesel fuel residues and combustion‑derived PAH. High concentrations of these contaminants were detected in nearby subtidal sediments. Small amounts of diesel fuel contamination are detectable throughout Arthur Harbor. Despite being abandoned for years, soils in the vicinity of Old Palmer Station and Base N represent the most concentrated source of contaminants in Arthur Harbor. Environmentally sound practices at Palmer Station have helped to minimize local contamination.

Abstract	
PM10 (atmospheric aerosol particles with diameters less than 10 microns) is a regulated air pollutant in the United States. This study was undertaken to determine the natural and anthropogenic sources of PM10 at McMurdo Station, whose austral summer population exceeds 1,000 and whose reported summer diesel fuel consumption for power generation, heating and water production, and equipment operation is 6.1 million liters. Air‑sampling was initiated at McMurdo Station during austral summer 1995‑96. Emissions were sampled from the major sources: power generators, space heating, surface vehicles, helicopters, and C‑130 aircraft. Local soils from around the station were also collected. Average concentrations (μ/m3, micrograms per cubic meter of air) of PM10 and selected chemical species at Hut Point and Radar Sat are given in a table for austral summer 1995‑96. Source contributions to PM10 at Hut Point were estimated. The largest PM10 component was geological dust (46%) followed by sea salt (21%), combustion (17%), sulfuric acid and ammonium bisulfate (15%), and ammonium nitrate (2%). Sources of sulfur were discussed. It is clear from the elevated elemental carbon concentrations at Hut Point that McMurdo has at least perturbed the atmosphere around the station. The potential impact of associated air pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and sulfur on downwind ecosystems is of great interest. As part of this study, meteorological modeling will be used to estimate the areal extent of the McMurdo plume.

Abstract	
This project is part of a program to assess the possible environmental impacts of human activities in Antarctica on the pristine surroundings. One of these impacts is due to the emission of "black carbon" (BC) particles in the combustion exhaust from diesel‑powered generators, oil‑fired space heaters, and vehicles used to support Antarctic operations. In this project, equipment was installed upwind and downwind of the Amundsen‑Scott South Pole Station to reestablish the background aerosol measurements and to monitor the station's combustion emissions. The data during winter seasons suggest that the emission rate of aerosol BC from the main generators of the South Pole Station is on the order of 1 milligram per second. The upwind data show that the BC concentrations in the background atmosphere is in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 ng/m3 for several months. It is the author's personal opinion that during the summer season, activities are likely to lead to far greater emissions of soot from aircraft operations, intensive vehicle operations, heating of outlying buildings, etc.

Abstract	
This report presents the results of ambient air monitoring of metals in total suspended particulate (TSP) matter performed during the 1992‑93 summer at McMurdo Station. Seven samples of TSP were collected from 3 different locations and analyzed for arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and mercury. Critical‑flow high‑volume air samplers were used to collect the particulate matter on quartz fiber filters for subsequent laboratory analysis. Sampling site selection, sampling procedures, and quality assurance procedures used were consistent with US Environmental Protection Agency guidance for local ambient air quality networks. The data indicate that McMurdo operations have a measurable impact on the qualitative toxic metals composition of suspended particulate matter in the ambient air. The levels measured are well below the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists worker exposure levels.

Abstract	
Human activities (tourism and research) near Palmer Station has increased significantly since 1975. Although these activities were focused on the large, easily accessible populations of Adélie penguins on Litchfield and Torgersen islands, Litchfield I. became a Specially Protected Area (SPA) in 1978. This ended tourism on the island and reduced research‑related activity to negligible levels. Despite SPA status, the total breeding population of Adélie penguins on Litchfield I. decreased by 43% between 1975 and 1992. In contrast, on Torgersen I., where tourism and research‑related activities continued to increase over the same time period, the decrease in these populations was only 19%. It is suggested that the potentially adverse effects of tourism and research may be negligible relative to the effects imposed by long‑term changes in other environmental variables.

Abstract	
The spatial distribution, movement and impact of the untreated wastewater outfall from McMurdo Station were investigated under early austral summer conditions. The benthic environment was examined to determine the distribution of Clostridium perfringens in sediment cores and the intestinal contents of native invertebrates and fish along a transect of stations. These stations extended ca. 411 m south of the outfall. The findings revealed that the concentration of C. perfringens decreased with depth in the sediment and distance from the outfall. High percentages of tunicates and sea urchins were colonized with this bacterium along the transect. Corrostanol concentrations were also measured in sediment samples taken from each of the transect stations, and a similar trend was observed. These results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies performed with the water column and collectively provide evidence that the disposal of domestic wastes deserves special consideration in polar marine environments.

Publication Date	1992
Abstract	
This report represents the evaluation by a group of scientists who investigated the effects of the Bahia Paraiso oil spill near Arthur Harbor. Microbial hydrocarbon oxidation potential (CO2‑14 evolved from labeled hexadecane) was detected throughout both the oil‑impacted and control regions. Hexadecane was mineralized at extremely low rates (0.13‑1.21 pmol/g sediment dry weight/day); microbiological turnover time exceeded 2 years. The acute effects of DFA (measured over exposure periods of 3‑7 days) on the metabolic activities of sedimentary microorganisms appear to be negligible even at seawater saturation concentrations of DFA. Long‑term exposure (120 days) to varying concentrations of DFA resulted in significant decreases (>90%) in total ATP, but had either no effect or a slight stimulatory effect on metabolic activity and production. In contrast to planktonic microbial communities, increasing incubation temperatures of between 0 and 30 C had a positive effect on rates of metabolism and production of sedimentary assemblages. These results may influence the overall weathering rates of hydrocarbons deposited in the intertidal and supratidal regions of Arthur Harbor and other polar regions.

Abstract	
To evaluate the acute and chronic effects of Bahia Paraiso oil on the resident microbial communities, several different experiments were performed. These were designed to provide estimates of hydrocarbon biodegradation rates at low «in situ» temperatures, to establish the biological and environmental constraints which may be unique to the antarctic marine and intertidal habitats, and to add to the oil spill modeling database. Initial results indicate that the Bahia Paraiso oil spill had no detrimental impact on the microbial communities in Arthur Harbor. This is probably a combined result of limited exposure of the sediment communities to the released oil, and to the microbiologically benign characteristics of the Bahia Paraiso  OFA, a blend of diesel and jet fuel, which might be expected to behave differently from the more well‑studied and more recalcitrant and toxic crude‑oil components.

Title	Distribution of enteric bacteria in antarctic seawater surrounding the sewage outfall at McMurdo Station

Abstract	
This study was initiated to describe the persistence, distribution, and environmental impact of enteric bacteria originating from the sewage outfall at McMurdo Station. The focus of this communication is the distribution of the sewage plume in the seawater. The authors describe the preliminary results of a field study that was carried out at McMurdo Station in 1990. A confirmation of these findings as well as experiments to address the other aspects of the project are ongoing.


Title	Environmental impact assessment and monitoring of DVDP
Author	Parker, B.C.
Source	Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP). Bulletin, No.7, p.117. United States
Publication Date	Sep. 1976
Abstract	
Highlights of the field monitoring program of DVDP are: 1) the development of DFA decomposing soil microorganisms, for example at New Harbor and Lake Vida; 2) inhibition or annihilation of native soil microorganisms by calcium chloride spills, such as at Lake Fryxell; and 3) probable introduction of non‑native microorganisms to Don Juan Pond. The monitoring effort has resulted in the successful testing of several new methods. The ways in which environmental impact assessments for DVDP have improved on a matrix system proposed by Leopold et al (1972) are noted.

Title	Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon exposure in antarctic fish
Author	McDonald, S.; Kennicutt, M.C., II; Foster‑Springer, K.; Krahn, M.; et al

Publication Date	1992
Abstract	
A study was undertaken to assess polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure in fish. The bile of Notothenia coriiceps neglecta captured near Palmer Station and the Bahia Paraiso wreck and Notothenia coriiceps neglecta, Notothenia gibberifrons, and Chaenocephalus aceratus captured near remote sites (Low Island. and Dallmann Bay) was screened by HPLC/fluorescence detection. Assessing PAH exposure in antarctic fish by screening bile using HPLC/fluorescence detection is useful, but must be confirmed by other techniques to minimize the false positive indications of exposure caused by spectral interferences noted in some bile samples.

Title	Evaluation of bioremediation in cold regions

Publication Date	Sep. 1997
Abstract	
Biological treatment has become increasingly popular as a remediation method for soils and ground water contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon, chlorinated solvents, and pesticides. Bioremediation has been considered for application in cold regions such as arctic and subarctic climates and Antarctica. Studies to date suggest that indigenous microbes suitable for bioremediation exist in soils in these regions. This paper reports on two case studies in which indigenous bacteria were found that were capable of mineralizing petroleum hydrocarbons in soil contaminated with jet fuel and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Antarctica and pentachlorophenol (PCP) and diesel in contaminated soil in the subarctic Alaska. However, in both instances, ex‑situ bioremediation was recommended for treatment of the contaminated soil because ex‑situ treatment allows greater control over soil temperature, a limiting factor in cold climates. 


Title	Assessment of the presence of oil‑degrading microbes at McMurdo Station

Publication Date	1994
Abstract	
McMurdo Station, situated next to Winter Quarters Bay, consists of more than 100 structures, including a fuel‑storage and transfer system. The existing fuel‑storage system includes 18 above‑ground steel storage tanks located in 3 tank farms, referred to as Hut Point Tank Farm, Tank Farm 1 and Tank Farm 2. A schematic of the location of the tank farms in relation to major features of McMurdo Station is shown in a figure. McMurdo Station has had numerous reported and suspected fuel releases. Soil analysis data support the theory that due to the abundance of fuel released at McMurdo Station, some form of organism has found its niche and is utilizing this readily available carbon source.


Title	Anthropogenic and natural disturbances to marine benthic communities in Antarctica

Publication Date	May 1995
Abstract	
This study describes changes in marine bottom communities along a well‑defined gradient of contamination in Antarctica. Community changes were characterized and results used to explore the recovery of disturbed communities. The authors tested the hypotheses that relative rates of recovery of disturbed communities are: (1) dependent on the initial structure of the community and (2) much slower in eutrophic habitats compared with oligotrophic habitats. Based on the results of these tests, predictions of the impacts of future anthropogenic disturbances in different oceanographic conditions of McMurdo Sound were derived. Also tested was the hypothesis that community responses to anthropogenic chemical contamination are similar to those around natural physical disturbances (those caused by icebergs and anchor ice).
