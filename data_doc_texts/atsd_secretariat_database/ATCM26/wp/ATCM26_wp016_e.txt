Review of draft Protected Area Management Plans
Report of the Australia-led Intersessional Contact Group

Working Paper
Submitted by the Australia


At the fifth meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP V) Australia submitted three draft management plans for protected areas for the Committee’s consideration.  These were:

    1. Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 135, North-east Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land;
    2. Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 143, Marine Plain, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, 
    3. Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. xxx , Frazier Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica

To further consider the management plans, CEP V established an Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) to be led by Australia. The ICG was required to report back to CEP VI. The ICG used the Terms of Reference established by CEP IV for the review of draft management plans for protected areas:

    1. ensure that each of the draft Management Plans are consistent with the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas;
    2. ensure consistency of approach of management measures, as appropriate, across the Management Plans being reviewed;
    3. report back to CEP VI on the results of the contact group’s assessment and provide recommendations on how the CEP should proceed with respect to these Management Plans.

Australia initiated the contact group by means of a circular email to all CEP contact points on 14 October 2002.  New Zealand, Sweden and Romania responded to say that they wished to participate in the work of the group. Comments and suggestions on the draft management plans were received from Romania, New Zealand and SCAR.

Suggestions were received for the clarification of a number of points contained in management plan sections: Aims and objectives; Management activities; and Permit conditions. Where appropriate the suggestions were incorporated into the revised plans. In the management plan for North-east Bailey Peninsula, ASPA No. 135, the section dealing with the description of values to be protected was restructured to more clearly differentiate the specific values of the Area from those of the wider region. 

The ICG is satisfied that the plans have been appropriately revised and that they are consistent with the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans.  The contact group therefore submits the finalised management plans for approval by the CEP and ATCM.

MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ANTARCTIC SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA NO. 135, NORTH-EAST BAILEY PENINSULA, BUDD COAST, WILKES LAND
Introduction
North-east Bailey Peninsula was designated in 1985 as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No 16 through Recommendation XIII-8 (1983), after a proposal by Australia. In accordance with Resolution XX -5 (1996) the site was redesignated and renumbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 135. This revised Management Plan reaffirms the scientific values of the original designation. The Area was originally designated because it is representative of a diverse assemblage of vegetation with extremely rich lichen and moss beds and an important stand of liverwort, these values are reaffirmed in this revised Management Plan.
1. Description of Values to be Protected
Windmill Islands Region
Excluding the Antarctic Peninsula, Bailey Peninsula, among Clark and Mitchell Peninsulas, and Robinson Ridge in the Windmill Islands region support some of the most extensive and best-developed plant communities on continental Antarctica. The region has rich associations of macrolichens and bryophytes that occupy very specific ecological niches. The flora of the Windmill Islands region comprises 36 species of lichen, five bryophyte species, a liverwort, and 150 non-marine algae and 120 fungal taxa have been recorded. An ascomycete mycorrhizal fungus has been shown in the liverwort Cephaloziella varians. Three species of the lichen genus Lecidea have been collected and await identification.
Eleven cryptogamic sociations have been identified. The vegetation forms a continuum of ecological variation along environmental gradients of soil moisture, soil chemistry, and microclimate. On the peninsulas, the major community types are distinguished by the dominance of three bipolar lichens, Usnea sphacelata, Pseudephebe minuscula and Umbilicaria decussata. Vegetation communities on the islands are dominated by algal species such as Prasiola crispa, with moss and lichen being considerably poorer developed than on the peninsulas. Mosses and lichens are all but absent in eutrophic sites near bird colonies with a preponderance of Prasiola crispa, Prasiococcus calcareous and Desmococcus olivaceus chlorophyte algae occurring. Lichens constitute the largest part of the Windmill Islands region flora with bryophytes being dominant in moister areas.
North-east Bailey Peninsula Protected Area
North-east Bailey Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area is representative of a diverse assemblage of the Windmill Islands region flora. As such, the Area has intrinsic ecological value and scientific importance, particularly to botanists, microbiologists, soil scientists and glacial geomorphologists.
The North-east Bailey Protected Area contains three extensive and contrasting moss fields that are the subject of taxonomic, ecological and physiological studies that commenced during the summer of 1982-3. Additional studies include population ecology of invertebrates associated with the vegetation, and soil/water chemistry. Permanent lichen growth monitoring sites have also been established as have sites monitoring annual growth increments in mosses. The cryptogamic plant communities are also being observed in relation to short-term microclimate fluctuation and long-term climate change in the region since deglaciation 8000-5000 years BP. Studies in the Area were undertaken as part of the Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) program. More recent  studies have concentrated on the determination of biodiversity, physiological and biochemical attributes, component interactions, impact of anthropogenic pollutants, and potential effects of global climate change. Casey station is a nominated study site under the Regional Sensitivity to Climate Change in Antarctic Terrestrial and Limnetic Ecosystems (RiSCC) international research program on Antarctic and Peri-Antarctic terrestrial and limnetic organisms and ecosystems.
Moss and lichen communities are used to monitor the environmental impacts of Casey station. The Area provides baseline data with which to compare changes in similar plant communities in the immediate surroundings of Casey station. The Area also serves as a valuable comparative site for similar plant communities in  the Clark Peninsula ASPA, which are subject to less environmental stress and disturbance.
Proximity to Casey station minimises logistics problems with respect to field research and, at the same time, maximises the potential for disturbance of study areas. It is primarily for this reason that this Area, where research is concentrated, requires protection.
2. Aims and Objectives
Management at North-east Bailey Peninsula aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance and sampling in the Area;
    • preserve a part of the natural ecosystem as a reference Area for the purpose of future comparative studies and to assess direct and indirect effects of Casey station;
    • allow scientific research on the ecosystem in the Area provided it is for compelling reasons which cannot be served elsewhere;
    • minimise the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;
    • allow for maintenance of the Tandem Delta antenna communications installation and associated facilities without degradation of the Area’s values;
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the Management Plan.
3. Management Activities
The following management activities will be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • signs illustrating the location and boundaries, with clear statements of entry restrictions, shall be placed at appropriate locations at the boundaries of the Area to help avoid inadvertent entry;
    • information on the location of the Area (stating special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and a copy of this Management Plan shall be kept available, at the adjacent  Casey station and will be provided to ships visiting the vicinity;
    • markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition and removed when no longer required;
    • abandoned equipment or materials shall be removed to the maximum extent possible provided doing so does not adversely impact on the values of the Area;
    • visit the Area as necessary (no less than once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure that management activities are adequate: and
    • review the Management Plan at least every five years and update as required.
4. Period of Designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

6. Description of the Area
6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features
General Description
The North-east Bailey Peninsula Antarctic Specially Managed Area is approximately 0.28 square kilometres in area and located on Bailey Peninsula adjacent to the Windmill Islands Group on the Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, (Maps A and B). Bailey Peninsula is an area of rock exposures and permanent snow and ice fields and lies between Newcomb Bay and O’Brien Bay, two kilometres south of Clark Peninsula. The Area consists of an irregular area of exposed rock during summer on the northeast of Bailey Peninsula, with the north-western portion of the Area approximately 70 metres south of Brown Bay with Casey station (66°16’59.9”S, 110°31’59.9”E) approximately 200 metres to the west. Boundary coordinates for the Area are shown in Appendix I, Table 1. Topographically, Bailey Peninsula comprises low lying, rounded ice-free rocky outcrops (maximum altitude approximately 40 metres), and, approximately three kilometres east rising to the Løken Moraines (altitude approximately 130 metres). Intervening valleys are filled with permanent snow or ice, or glacial moraine and exfoliated debris and contain water catchment areas. The topography of Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map C.
Climate
The climate of the Windmill Islands region is frigid-Antarctic. Meteorological data for the period 1957 to 1983, from Casey station (altitude 32 m) on Bailey Peninsula show mean temperatures for the warmest and coldest months of 0.3 and -14.9˚C, respectively, with extreme temperatures ranging from 9.2 to -41˚C, mean annual temperature for the period was –9.3˚C. The climate is dry with a mean annual snowfall of 195 mm year-1 (rainfall equivalent), precipitation as rain has been recorded in the summer. However, within the last decade the mean annual temperature has changed to –9.1˚C and mean annual snowfall to 230 mm year-1 (rainfall equivalent).
There is an annual average of 96 days with gale-force winds, which are predominantly easterly in direction, off the polar ice cap. Blizzards are a frequent occurrence especially during winter. Snowfall is common during the winter, but the extremely strong winds scour the exposed areas of the Peninsula of snow. On most hill crests on Bailey Peninsula snow gathers in the lee of rock outcrops and in depressions in the substratum. Further down the slopes snow forms deeper drifts.
Geology and Soils
Windmill Islands Region
The Windmill Islands region represent one of the eastern most outcrops of a Mesoproterozoic low-pressure granulite facies terrain that extends west to the Bunger Hills and further to the Archaean complexes in Princess Elizabeth Land, to minor exposures in the east in the Dumont d’Urville area and in Commonwealth Bay. The total outcrop areas do not exceed more than a few square kilometres. The Mesoproterozoic outcrop of the Windmill Islands and the Archaean complexes of Princess Elizabeth Land are two the few major areas in East Antarctica that can be directly correlated with an Australian equivalent in a Gondwana reconstruction. The Mesoproterozoic facies terrain  comprise a series of migmatitic metapelites and metapsammites interlayered with mafic to ultramafic and felsic sequences with rare calc-silicates, large partial melt bodies (Windmill Island supacrustals), undeformed granite, charnockite, gabbro, pegmatite, aplites and cut by easterly-trending late dolerite dykes. 
Bailey Peninsula
Bailey Peninsula is part of a the northern gradation of a metamorphic grade transition which separates the northern part of the Windmill Islands region from the southern part. The metamorpohic grade ranges from amphibolite facies, sillimanite-biotite-orthoclase in the north at Clark Peninsula, through biotite-cordierite-almandine granulite, to hornblende-orthopyroxene granulite at Browning Peninsula in the south. The Ardery Charnockite of the south is prone to deep weathering and crumbles readily because of its mineral assemblage, whereas the metamorphic sequences of the northerly parts of the region have a much more stable mineral assemblage and crystalline structure. This difference has a significant influence on the distribution of vegetation in the Windmill Islands region with the northern rock types providing a more suitable substrate for slow growing lichens.
The leucocratic granite gneiss which constitutes the main outcrop on Bailey Peninsula, may be subdivided into leucogneiss and two different types of garnet-bearing gneiss. The outcrop on Bailey Peninsula is characterised as a garnet-bearing gneiss type 1 which is  white, medium grained and foliated. The foliation is defined by the alignment of an early biotite generation that is tight to openly folded, with a garnet and a later biotite generation that overgrows the fabric. Unmetamorphosed and undeformed dolerite dykes occur over Bailey Peninsula such as at “Penguin Pass” (-66°17’18”, 110°33’16”E), to the south of the ASPA. Small outcrops of metapelite, metapsammite and leuco- gneisses occur on the Peninsula. Recent geochronology of the rocks of the Windmill Islands region suggest two major phases of metamorphism, the first at c. 1400-1310 Ma, an upper amphibolite facies event, followed by a granulite facies overprint c. 1210-1180 Ma. The geology of Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map F.
Glaciation
The Windmill Islands region was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene. The southern region of the Windmill Islands was deglaciated by 8000 corr. yr B.P., and the northern region, including Bailey Peninsula deglaciated by 5500 corr. yr B.P.  Isostatic uplift has occurred at a rate of between 0.5 and 0.6 m/100 yr, with the upper mean marine limit,  featured as ice-pushed ridges, being observed on Bailey Peninsula at approximately 30 metres where they extend in continuous rows from the present sea-level.
Soils
Soils on Bailey Peninsula are derived from weathered gneiss, moraine deposits and outwash gravels stemming from glacial episodes. Seabirds have a large impact on soil formation in the entire landscape. Soils are frozen much of the year, during summer the upper 30-60 cm thaws with the few top centimetres, refreezing at night. Soils are mainly formed by cryoturbation and cryoclastic weathering. In the vicinity of Casey station most soils are classified by Blume, Kuhn and Bölter (2002) as cryosols with lithic, leptic, skeletal, turbic and stagnic subunits. Other soils in the Area are gelic subunits of histosols, podzols, and regosols, boulder and rock outcrops with ecto- and enolithic flora are classified as Lithosols. 
Lakes
Cold monomictic lakes and ponds occur throughout the Windmill Islands region in bedrock depressions and are usually ice-free during January and February. Nutrient rich lakes are found near the coast , in close proximity to penguin colonies or abandoned colonies, sterile lakes are located further inland and are fed by meltwater and local precipitation. A number of these lakes and ponds occur across Bailey Peninsula with two large lakes located 500 metres to the west of the  Area. Two ponds occur within the protected Area, the largest being approximately 75 metres by 50 metres and the smaller approximately 25 metres diameter. The distribution of lakes and ponds on Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map E.
Vegetation
The vegetation of Bailey Peninsula is exceptionally well developed and diverse and represents one of the most important botanical sites on continental Antarctica. Within the relatively complex plant communities and contrasting habitats found on Bailey Peninsula, are found at least 23 lichens, three mosses, and an important stand of liverwort. The flora forms dense stands of macrolichens and in the moister and more sheltered areas bryophytes form closed stands of 25-50 m2 moss turf up to 30 cm in depth. The lichens, Umbilicaria decussata, Pseudephebe minuscula and Usnea sphacelata with mixed bryophytes dominate the vegetation cover of most of the ice-free areas, particularly on the north-east and centre of the Peninsula in dense lichen communities similar to those found on Clark Peninsula. Abandoned penguin colonies are dominated by Xanthoria candelaria, Candelariella hallettensis, Buellia frigida and Usnea antarctica. The most complex bryophyte communities are restricted to small locally moist hollows adjacent to melt pools and streams in the central north-east and central parts of the Peninsula. Vegetation is absent or poorly developed on the ice-free areas of the Peninsula’s southern coast. Annex I, Table 2 provides a list of bryophytes and lichens identified in the Bailey Peninsula ASPA.
Two principal cryptogamic subformations are recognised; a lichen dominated association occupying a variety of windswept substrata ranging from bedrock to gravel, and, a short cushion and turf moss subformation comprising four moss dominated sociations. The vegetation of Bailey Peninsula is shown at Maps D and F.
At least 145 taxa of non-marine algae and cyanobacteria flora have been isolated and include 50 cyanobacteria, 70 chlorophytes and 23 chromophytes. The taxa have been found in snow and ice, soil, rocks, ephemeral ponds, tarns and lakes, 24 of these cyanobacterial and algal species occur in the snow. Snow algae are abundant and widespread in the icy corridors between the rocky outcrops and in semi-permanent snow drifts. A list of cyanobacterial and algal species from the Area, Bailey Peninsula, and the Windmill Islands region is shown in Appendix I, Table 3.
The vegetated soils of Bailey Peninsula contain fungal hyphae, yeasts, fungal propagules, an assortment of algae, cyanobacteria, protozoa, and provide a significant habitat for soil microfauna such as nematodes, mites, rotifers and tardigrades. There is relatively low fungal diversity in the Windmill Islands region, with 35 taxa representing 22 genera of fungi being isolated from soils, mosses, algae and lichens. Compared with mosses and algae, fungal distribution and diversity are poor in lichens. Thirty taxa have been detected in the soils in the vicinity of Casey station with 12 of these taxa restricted to anthropologically influenced soils around the station, Penicillium species dominated in these sites. Eight fungi taxa have been isolated from soils within the Area. More broadly within the Windmill Islands region, 21 taxa have been isolated from the mosses, Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus and Grimmia antarctici, with 12 taxa isolated from algae and 6 taxa from the lichens, Xanthoria candelaria, Umbilicaria decussata and Usnea sphacelata. A number of fungi have also been found associated with animals of the region. Appendix I, Table 4 provides detail of the taxa and their source.
Birds
Four species of birds are known to nest in the vicinity of Bailey Peninsula. These include Adélie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, which is the most abundant bird species in the Area. The nearest breeding colony is on Shirley Island about 1.5 km west of Casey station. Snow Petrels Pagodroma nivea, are seen all year-round and breed throughout the Windmill Islands region including Reeve Hill about 750 metres west of the Area and Budnick Hill, 600 metres to the northwest. Wilson’s Storm Petrel Oceanites oceanicus, breeds throughout the Windmill Islands region and nests in the Area. The Antarctic Skua Catharacta maccormicki, breeds throughout the Windmill Islands region at widely dispersed nests, mostly near Adélie Penguin colonies.
Other birds that breed in the Windmill Islands region but not in the immediate vicinity of Bailey Peninsula include Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus, Cape Petrel Daption capense, Southern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides and Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica antarctica. The Emperor Penguin Aptenodytes forsteri is a common visitor to the Windmill Islands region and a breeding colony of approximately 2000 pairs is established in the area of Peterson Bank.
Terrestrial invertebrates and microbial communities
The Antarctic flea Glaciopsyllus antarcticus, has been found in the nests of  Southern fulmars, Fulmarus glacialoides. The anopluran louse, Antarctophthirus ogmorhini, is found on the Weddell Seal,  Leptonychotes weddellii. A number of species of mallophagan lice have also been found on birds.
The mite Nanorchestes antarcticus has been found on Bailey Peninsula at sites characterised as having sandy or gravelly soils, free of extensive moss or lichen cover, and moist but not water-logged.
Five species of tardigrades have been collected on Bailey Peninsula, Pseudechiniscus suillus, Macrobiotus sp., Hypsibius antarcticus, Ramajendas frigidus and Diphascon chilenense. Significant positive associations between bryophytes and the most common species of tardigrades, P. suillus, H. antarcticus and D. chilenense, have been found, and strong negative associations between those species and algae and lichens have been established. No systematic or ecological accounts of nematodes have yet been published for the Windmill Islands region.
Protozoa have been studied on at a number of sites on Bailey Peninsula and in the Area, ciliates and testate amoebae are active. Twenty seven ciliate species and six testacean species have been found. The species are shown in Table 5.
6(ii) Special Zones within the Area
There are no special zones within the Area.
6(iii) Location of Structures within and adjacent to the Area
Casey station (Australia) is located west of the northern portion of the Area. Prior to the designation of the Area as a protected site in 1986 an array of radio transmitters had been established on the site progressively from 1964. During the summer of 2001/2002 redundant aerials and infrastructure were removed. A number of structures remain within the Area. These are a small storage rack in the north-west of the Area, the transmitter building and rigging store of 52.3 m2, a 45 metre high tandem delta antenna mast located in the south east of the protected Area. Another 35 metre mast is located approximately 100 metres south of the Area.
6(iv) Location of other Protected Areas in the vicinity
The nearest protected Area to North-east Bailey Peninsula is Clark Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 136, 2.5 km north-east of Bailey Peninsula, across Newcomb Bay, adjacent to abandoned Wilkes station. Antarctic Specially Protected Area, No. 103, Ardery Island, 6622’S, 11027’E, and Odbert Island, 6622’S, 11033’E, Budd Coast lying in Vincennes Bay, is approximately 11 km south of Casey station, west of Robinson Ridge.
7. Permit Conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by an appropriate National Authority. A Permit to enter the Area may only be issued for compelling scientific research, maintenance of the Tandem Delta antenna communications installation and associated facilities, or for essential management purposes consistent with the Management Plan’s objectives and provisions, and providing that the actions permitted will not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the Area or interfere with existing scientific studies. Conditions that must be included in the Permit are that the Permit or an authorised copy shall be carried within the Area, and that the Permit specify the period for specific activities. Additional conditions, consistent with the Management Plan’s objectives and provisions, may be included by the issuing Authority.
7(i) Access to and Movement within or over the Area
Vehicles are prohibited within the Area and access should be by foot. The Area is accessible by walking, the Casey station precinct lies approximately 200 west of the north‑west of the Area. Helicopters are prohibited from landing within the Area. Visitors should avoid walking on visible vegetation. Care should be exercised walking in areas of moist ground, where foot traffic can easily damage sensitive soils, plant or algae communities, and degrade water quality: walk around such areas, on ice or rocky ground. Pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum necessary consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to walk on bare rocks and minimise impacts.
7(ii) Activities which are or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place
    • Compelling scientific research which cannot be undertaken elsewhere and which will not jeopardise the ecosystem of the Area.
    • Essential management activities, including monitoring.
    • Sampling, but this should be the minimum required for the approved research programs.
    • Maintenance and activities associated with the antennas and transmitter facility.
7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
Any structures erected or installed within the Area are to be specified in a Permit. Scientific markers and equipment must be secured and maintained in good condition, clearly identifying the permitting country, name of principal investigator and year of installation. All such items should be made of materials that pose minimum risk of contamination of the Area. Removal of equipment associated with scientific research before the Permit for that research expires, shall be a condition of the Permit. Details of markers and equipment left in situ (GPS locations, description, tags, etc. and expected “use by date”) should be reported to the permitting Authority.
7(iv) Location of field camps
Parties are prohibited from camping within the Area. 
7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area
    • No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and precautions shall be taken against accidental introductions.
    • No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area. Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, which may be introduced for scientific or management purposes specified in a Permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.
    • Fuel is not to be stored in the Area unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the Permit has been granted. Permanent fuel depots are not permitted.
    • All material introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction to the environment is minimised.
7(vi) Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna is prohibited, except in accordance with a Permit. Where taking or harmful interference with animals is involved this should, as a minimum standard, be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals For Scientific Purposes in Antarctica.
7(vii) Collection and removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder
Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.
Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, and which was not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of the removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ: if this is the case the appropriate Authority must be notified and approval obtained.
7(viii) Disposal of waste
All wastes, including all human wastes, shall be removed from the Area.
7(ix) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met
Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and Area inspection and management activities, which may involve the collection of small samples for analysis or review, to erect or maintain signposts, or for other protective measures.
Remove the storage rack and supplies located in the north-west of the Area, provided doing so does not adversely impact on the values of the Area.
Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
To help maintain the ecological and scientific values of the plant communities found in the Area persons entering the Area shall take special precautions against introductions. Of particular concern are microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils at other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica. To minimise the risk of introductions footwear and any equipment to be used in the Area – including sampling equipment and markers – shall be thoroughly cleaned before entering the Area.
7(x) Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal Permit Holder for each Permit issued submit to the appropriate Authority a report describing the activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form contained in Appendix 4 of Resolution 2 (1998)(CEPI). Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Management Plan. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage; to be used both in any review of the Management Plan and in organising the scientific use of the Area.

MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ANTARCTIC SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA
NO. 143 MARINE PLAIN, MULE PENINSULA, VESTFOLD HILLS,
PRINCESS ELIZABETH LAND

Introduction
Marine Plain was originally designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 25 in 1987 (ATCM Recommendation XIV-5). In accordance with Resolution V (1996), this site is redesignated and renumbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 143.
This revised Plan of Management reaffirms the scientific values of the original designation and accords with Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection.
The Vestfold Hills is an ice-free area of low altitude, undulating hills and hundreds of lakes and ponds. Marine Plain (6837’50.2” S, 7807’55.2” E) is located on Mule Peninsula in the southwest of the Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica (Map A). Through ASPA designation, this sensitive Area can be protected for future studies of the palaeoenvironment of Antarctica.
1. Description of Values to be Protected 
Marine Plain is representative of a major Antarctic terrestrial ice-free ecosystem with outstanding fossil fauna and rare geological features. It is of exceptional ongoing scientific interest and has been subject to several detailed geological, palaeontological, geomorphological and glaciological studies. This is the first time much of this information has been available from the coast of East Antarctica. 
Marine Plain is of exceptional scientific interest because of its relevance to the palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic record of Antarctica. The Area has yielded outstanding vertebrate fossil fauna including Australodelphis mirus, the first higher vertebrate named from the Oligocene-Pleistocene interval on land in Antarctica, and the first cetacean fossil from the polar margin of circum-Antarctic Southern Ocean that postdates the break-up of Gondwana. Marine Plain has also revealed four other species of cetaceans; a species of fish; and a diverse invertebrate fauna comprising molluscs, gastropods, marine diatoms, and the first Pliocene decapod crustacean from Antarctica.
Marine Plain contains a roughly horizontal section of ca 8 m thick Pliocene marine sediments known as the Sørsdal Formation (Map D), which is in some areas exposed, but elsewhere underlies Holocene sediments, up to about 1 m thick. A diatom biostratigraphy placed the Sørsdal Formation in the Fragilariopsis barronii Zone, Early Pliocene (ca 4.5-4.1 Ma). The early Pliocene deposits are crucial as a source of information on the environment at this stage of Antarctic history. The fossil fauna – including deposits of vertebrate and invertebrate species – aids in the greater understanding of the early Pliocene Antarctic environments, including high-latitude climate and oceanography. By examining the diatom microfossils, it is possible to reconstruct the probable palaeoenvironmental conditions relating to the Sørsdal Formation and test hypothetical models of ice sheet behaviour against the geological record. This will also help in exploring the Antarctic ice sheet’s response to future global warming.
The Vestfold Hills has an ice-free area of approximately 413 km2, and are characterised by their low altitude, typically less that 180 m. The hills have been subject to intermittent glaciation and exposed rocks are characterised by polishing, striation and fracturing. The glacial striae show the direction of past ice movements. These features, together with other periglacial and glacial features have been extensively studied to investigate the region’s geomorphological and glacial history.
In addition, Marine Plain provides the largest periglacial thermokarst in East Antarctica. Sediments are normally cemented by permafrost (in addition to any cement formed during diagenesis), however thawing can lead to undercutting and collapse. The thermokarst landforms have been produced by thermal back wearing of low scarps, and include thaw pits, thaw lakes, ground ice sumps, linear depressions and very small scale beaded drainage features. Human impact may accelerate the permafrost thawing resulting in disturbance of important geomorphological values and potentially threatening fossils in the diatomite.
Intrinsically linked to this geological plain is the adjacent Burton Lake. To the west of Marine Plain, Burton Lake is a hypersaline lagoon in seasonal connection with the marine environment. This lagoon represents a stage in the biological and physio-chemical evolution of a terrestrial water body from the marine environment i.e. the geological creation of a lake.
The meromictic and saline Burton Lake, together with several smaller lakes and ponds in the ASPA, provide important examples in the spectrum of hypersaline to fresh water lake types in the Vestfold Hills and present the opportunity for important geochemical and limnological research. The interrelationships between environment and biological communities in lakes such as Burton, provide considerable insights into the evolution of the lake environments and consequently, Antarctic environmental development. It is currently the only meromictic lagoon that has been protected within East Antarctica.
Due to its proximity to Davis station (Australia), the scientific values of the Area may be compromised or damaged by accidental interference. The Area lies on the pedestrian route (Map B) to the Mule Peninsula lakes (Clear, Laternula, and McCallum) from Ellis Rapids and is easily accessible. The Area merits protection, as there is a demonstrable risk of interference which may jeopardise scientific investigation. For this reason, it is critical that fossil fauna be protected from unrecorded sampling, collection, or interference.
2. Aims and Objectives
Management for the Marine Plain ASPA aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of Marine Plain by preventing unnecessary human disturbance in the ASPA;
    • allow scientific research for geological, palaeoclimatic, palaeontological, geomorphological, and limnological purposes, while ensuring protection from over-sampling;
    • allow other scientific research provided it is for compelling reasons that cannot be served elsewhere;
    • minimise damage to landforms, particularly Marine Plain; the plain south of Poseidon Lake and east of Pickard Ridge (68°37'22.8"S, 78°07 9.9"E); glacial and periglacial features; and potential fossil sites; 
    • maintain the aesthetic and wilderness values of the Area; and
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the Management Plan.
3. Management Activities 
The following management activities will be undertaken to protect the values the Area:
    • information on the location of the Area (stating special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and a copy of this Management Plan shall be kept available, at the adjacent  Davis station, Marine Plain Refuge and will be provided to ships visiting the vicinity;
    • install boundary markers to identify boundary turning points;
    • signs illustrating the location and boundaries, with clear statements of entry restrictions, shall be placed at appropriate locations at the boundaries of the Area to help avoid inadvertent entry;
    • require an environmental impact assessment of any activity within the ASPA in accordance with the requirements of Annex 1 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. A plan for the rehabilitation of the study site related to the activity should be submitted along with the environmental impact assessment application if appropriate;
    • markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition and removed when no longer required;
    • abandoned equipment or materials shall be removed to the maximum extent possible provided doing so does not adversely impact on the values of the Area;
    • visit the Area as necessary (no less than once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure that management activities are adequate: and
    • review the Management Plan at least every five years and update as required.

6. Description of the Area
6(i). Geographical Co-Ordinates, Boundary Markers and Natural Features
General Description
Marine Plain ASPA lies approximately 10 km southeast of Davis station in the Vestfold Hills. The Area (23.4 km2, 68°37'50.2" S, 78°07'55.2" E) opens into an arm of Crooked Fjord on the southern side of Mule Peninsula, the southernmost of the three major peninsulas that comprise the Vestfold Hills. The Vestfold Hills are a largely ice-free oasis of approximately 512 km2 of bedrock, glacial debris, lakes, and ponds, at the eastern side of Prydz Bay, Princess Elizabeth Land.
The Area includes Marine Plain (approximately 3 km2), which occupies the centre of the Area in a north-south orientation. Pickard Ridge (maximum elevation of 70 m) separates this site from Poseidon Basin in the northeast. Both locations are low-lying areas less than 20 m above sea level. Sections elsewhere above 20m are mostly low, rugged hills of Precambrian rock, and characterised at their base by a marked change in slope which may represent a Holocene shoreline. The surface of the lower area below 20 m is marked by a series of concave-to-the-south recessional moraine ridges. A series of south westerly facing sand slopes occupy Marine Plain east of Burton Lake. 
The boundary of the ASPA has been slightly altered along its northern boundaries to reduce the possibility of inadvertent entry from a nearby pedestrian route. Starting at the most northerly point of the Area the boundary description is as follows:
Commencing at 68°36’34”S, 78°09’28”E, then south-easterly to 68°36’45”S, 78°10’30”E; then south-easterly to 68°37’30”S, 78°12’30”E, then south along meridian of longitude 78°12’30”E to its intersection with the northern shore of Pineapple Lake; then west along that shore to the edge of the Sørsdal Glacier; then westerly along the northern edge of the Sørsdal Glacier to its intersection with the low water mark of the north eastern shore of  Crooked Fjord; then westerly along the low water mark of the northern shore of  Crooked Fjord (cutting across the outlet of Burton Lake into Crooked Fjord) to its intersection with the meridian of longitude 78°03’0”E; then north along meridian of longitude 78°03’0"E to its intersection with the parallel of latitude 68°37’30”S, then north-easterly to 68°36’56”S, 78°05’39”E, then north-easterly to the point of commencement.
Geology and Palaeontology
The three major lithologies forming the Vestfold Hills (Map C) are (in order of age) Chelnock Paragneiss, Mossel Gneiss and Crooked Lake Gneiss. This is repeated in units from east-northeast to west-southwest. Intruded into these, are groups of mafic dykes in a rough north-south orientation (Map C). The dykes are a major feature of the Vestfold Hills.
The Precambrian rock is overlain in low-lying areas (approximately 10–17 m above sea level) by ca 8 m of early Pliocene (ca 4.5-3.5 Ma) diatomite with limestone lenses in the upper half. The limestone contains molluscs, especially bivalves including Chlamys tuftsensis Turner. Holocene (ca 6.49 ka) glacial debris disconformably covers the marine deposit (0.5-1 m), extending over an area of 8-10 km2. A layer of lenticular sandstone separates the Pliocene and Holocene units. 
Low scarps in the Pliocene marine sediments have yielded a diverse array of fossil marine vertebrates and invertebrates. The cetacean specimens occur as large assemblages of vertebral columns, skulls, or complete specimens normally about 2m or more in length, in the upper 2m of the Marine Plain section. The main occurrences are along the margins of locally known “Big Ditch”, near Burton Lake, and in the scarp on the eastern side of Marine Plain. One notable cetacean fossil is Australodelphis mirus which illustrates a remarkable convergence between living dolphins (Family Delphinidae) and the living beaked whale genus Mesoplodon. 
Marine Plain has also yielded the first Pliocene decapod crustacean from Antarctica The specimen is incomplete, making it difficult to identify precisely, although it probably belongs with the Palinuridae. Other species include a beaked whale and baleen whale (and others not yet studied), possibly penguins, fish, bivalves, gastropods, serpulid worms, bryozoans, asteroids, ophiuroids, echinoids and abundant leiospheres that are probably planktonic in origin.
Marine Plain has been subject to significant fluvial activity since the mid-Holocene resulting in small patches of lake sediment on its eastern side. Stream valleys and source lakes (now virtually empty) have been identified.
The Pliocene diatomite at Marine Plain appears to be the only such deposit in the Vestfold Hills. In some areas the Holocene till and glacials are very thin and consequently are easily disturbed. A thin crust over the loose powdery surface is easily crushed by footfall, releasing a plume of diatom and sand rich dust, and leaving a sharply defined, colour-contrasting footprint.
Permafrost occurs below ca 1m depth and the local landforms have evolved due to very slow progressive melting of ground ice. Terrain produced by this process is known as periglacial thermokarst because the resulting depressions give the topography an appearance similar to that of conventional limestone karst. 
The Sørsdal Glacier (near the edge of the Antarctic ice sheet) is the southern boundary for the ice-free Vestfold Hills. A 1 km length of the northern edge of Sørsdal Glacier has retreated c. 800 m away from the southern edge of Marine Plain in the 40 years from 1947. This retreat is due to the movement through the deep channel that the glacier fills, and the propensity of ice ridges forming in the glacier and collapsing into Crooked Fjord. 
Lakes
Burton Lake is a major feature of the western side of the Area. There are number of unnamed ponds and small lakes within the Area. Burton Lake is seasonally isolated marine lagoon is meromictic and hypersaline, with a maximum depth of 18 m. Burton Lake is ice-covered for 10-11 months of the year and is seasonally connected to Crooked Fjord by a tidal channel approximately 20 m wide and up to 2 m deep. The lake is isolated from Crooked Fjord for about 6-7 months of the year by ice. 
The lake contains a range of photosynthetic bacteria. The dominant species are Chlorobium vibriofome and C. limiola while minor species are Thiocapsa roseopersicina and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The lake also harbours psychrophilic bacteria which are relatively uncommon (in Antarctic coastal ice zones), and thrive on the increased availability of nutrients from continental inputs, pelagic algal blooms, and breakout of pelagic algae into the water column from ice melting in the spring and summer. One novel species of bacterium is Psychroserpens burtonensis, which has not been cultured from or recorded in any other environment. 
Marine algae are abundant in Burton Lake. A diatom floristic study of the lagoon revealed 41 diatom species. 
The ultrastructure of Postgaardi mariagerensis was reported for the first time from research in Burton Lake. This very unusual organism cannot be regarded as a euglenid but regarded as a member of the clade Euglenozoa – Euglenozoa incertae sedis. Additionally, Burton Lake is one of two Antarctic lakes from which the first account of choanoflagellates, including Diaphanoeca grandis, Diaphanoeca sphaerica and Saepicula leadbeateri were reported. It is also type location for Spiraloecion didymocostatum gen. et sp. nov. 
Four metazoan species have been regularly recorded in the zooplankton of Burton Lake: Drepanopus bispinosus and Paralabidocera antarctica (Copepoda), Rathkea lizzioides (Anthomedusae) and an un-named cydippid ctenophore. In addition, many holotrichia, at least two species of nematode, a large marine amphipod have been recorded in the benthic community, and tardigrades are present. 
One species of fish, Pagothenia borchgrevinki, has been observed in the lake on one occasion. This species is common in coastal areas and fjords of the Vestfold Hills, although it does not appear to inhabit the lake continuously. Due to the seasonal marine connection, it remains probable that additional algae, zooplankton and fish enter the lake but do not survive the winter.
Vegetation
Mosses and lichens occur in the vicinity of small ephemeral watercourses draining radially down the ‘talus skirt’ fringing the Precambrian hills. Numerous small crevices and cracks in the knoll jutting into the northern end of Burton Lake provide a rich lichen site, while the northern end of Poseidon Lake is rich in mosses. The moss and lichen flora of the Area has not been documented, although the Vestfold Hills supports at least six moss species and at least 23 lichens. 
Vertebrates
Several vertebrates occur sporadically within the Area during the summer months between November and February. Two bird species, Wilson's storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) and Snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) nest in the higher Precambrian rocks, while South polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) nest on marine Plain and occasionally around the water’s edge. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and Southern Elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) along with Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) also occur in small groups in the Area but have not been specifically studied here.
Climate
Meteorological data for the Area are confined almost entirely to observations at Davis station, 10 km northwest of Marine Plain. The Vestfold Hills area has a polar maritime climate that is cold, dry and windy. Summer days are typically sunny, with a midday temperature from -1C to +3C and a summer maximum of +5C, but temperatures are below 0C for most of the year falling to as low as 40.7C in winter. The maximum temperature recorded at Davis station from 1957 to 2001 was +13C. The record illustrates the seasonal climate expected for high latitudes, but on average Davis station is warmer than other Antarctic stations at similar latitudes. This has been attributed to the “rocky oasis” which results from the lower albedo of rock surfaces compared to ice, hence more solar energy is absorbed and re-radiated as heat. 
6(ii). Special Zones within the Area
None.
6(iii). Location of Structures Within and Adjacent to the Site
There are no refuges within the Area but two refuges are located nearby. Marine Plain Refuge (6836’54”S, 7865’30”E) is approximately 150 m north of the northern boundary of the Area. A helicopter landing site is immediately adjacent to this refuge. Watts Hut (6835’54”S, 7813’48”E) is located at the eastern end of Ellis Fjord, approximately 5 km east-northeast of the Marine Plain Refuge and 2.9 km east-northeast of the northern-most point of the Area. 
A variety of evidence of research activity remains at Marine Plain. Two parallel lines of small boulders mark out a helicopter landing site 30 m north of a fossil site (6837’37”S, 7808’11”E). At this fossil site, a black sheet of polythene (3 m x 1.7 m) held down by rocks is currently covering an excavation site. At the north western side of the embayment, there are approximately 10 wooden stakes 1m high in a rough line, north to south. In the next embayment to the north, three red painted rock cairns form a triangle area (of side length approximately 50 m) remaining from field work in 1980.
Within Marine Plain there also remains plastered hessian covering fossil bones; five shallow unfilled pits; a large unfilled pit (near Burton Lake); a major unfilled excavation occurring on one high flank of a natural trough (the trough locally known as “Big Ditch”) and some old filled trench sites. On the north western side of Burton Lake lies a pipe and rope (possibly for lake monitoring).
Boundary markers are to be installed at boundary turning points.
6(iv). Location of Other Protected Areas in the Vicinity
Two Historic Sites and Monuments lay in the Vestfold Hills, at least 25 km north of Marine Plain:
    1. On the largest of the Tryne Islands (68° 18'29”S, 78° 23’44”E) in Tryne Bay (29 km north-east of Davis), HSM No. 72 is a cairn and wooden mast, erected in 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen marking the first landing in the Vestfold Hills area.
    2. Walkabout Rocks Cairn HSM No. 6 (6822’14”S, 7832’19”E) 40 km north-east of Davis, is a rock cairn erected in 1939 by Sir Hubert Wilkins. The cairn contains a canister containing a record of his visit. 
7. Permit Conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by an appropriate national authority. Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the ASPA are that:
    • it is issued only for scientific (palaeontological, palaeoclimatic, geological, geomorphological, glaciological, biological and limnological) research, or for compelling scientific, educational or cultural reasons, or for essential management purposes consistent with the Management Plan;
    • actions do not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the Area, or other permitted activities;
    • actions are consistent with the Plan of Management;
    • the Permit (or copy) shall be carried within the ASPA;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the appropriate national authority within three months of the expiry date of the Permit; and
    • Permits shall be issued for a stated period.
7(i). Access to and Movement within or over the Area 
    • Movement within the ASPA should be kept to a minimum with every reasonable effort made to minimise impact. The brittle surface crust is easily crushed under foot, risking damage to fossil material and long-term evidence of human impact. Where possible, movement on Precambrian areas is preferred, while movement on the scarps is to be avoided. All movement should be undertaken carefully so as to minimise disturbance to the soil, vegetation, diatomite, thermokarst, sediment outcrops and other geofeatures that provide scientific and environmental value to the site. Landing of aircraft and the use of vehicles is prohibited on the Sørsdal Formation.
    • Normally the helicopter landing site is immediately adjacent to the Marine Plain refuge should be used. In order to minimise foot traffic within Marine Plain, a helicopter landing site within the ASPA may be authorised for a particular visit. The landing site shall be:
        ◦ measured against overall usage in keeping with protected area status;
        ◦ on a debris free Precambrian bedrock surface (Map E) where minimal disturbance can be caused by the aircraft to water bodies, vegetation or sediment deposits; and
        ◦ at a location that will minimise the impact of passage to the intended research site.
    • Motorised boats are not to be used on Burton Lake.
    • Over-flight of lakes should be kept to the minimum necessary to achieve specific research or management requirements.
    • Movement within the ASPA by vehicle is prohibited.
7(ii). Activities which are, or may be conducted, within the Area, including restrictions on time and place
The following activities may be conducted within the ASPA throughout the year provided access requirements can be met:
    • compelling scientific research which cannot be undertaken elsewhere and that will not jeopardise the values of the ASPA;
    • sampling, which should be the minimum required for the approved research programs;
    • sampling of lakes, ensuring equipment is washed before entry to the ASPA to prevent contamination from other lakes; and
    • management activities, including monitoring.
7(iii). Installation, modification or removal of structures
Any structures erected or installed within the Area are to be specified in a Permit. Permanent structures or installations are prohibited. Scientific markers and equipment must be secured and maintained in good condition, clearly identifying the permitting country, name of principal investigator and year of installation. All such items should be made of materials that pose minimum risk of contamination of the Area. Removal of equipment associated with scientific research before the Permit for that research expires, shall be a condition of the Permit. Details of markers and equipment left in situ (GPS locations, description, tags and expected “use by date”) should be reported to the permitting Authority.
7(iv). Location of field camps
Parties should not camp in the Area but use the Marine Plain Refuge (6836’54”S, 786’30”E; see 6(iii)). 
7(v). Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area
    • No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the ASPA and the precautions shall be taken against accidental introductions.
    • No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the ASPA. Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, authorised for scientific or management purposes, must be removed from the ASPA at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.
    • Organic material (wood, cotton, hessian, etc.) is not to be used for scientific markers or other research unless absolutely necessary. Inorganic materials (stainless steel, polythene, etc.) are to be used.
    • Fuel is not to be stored in the ASPA unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the Permit has been granted. Fuel must be removed from the ASPA on or before completion of the associated activity. Permanent fuel depots are prohibited.
    • All materials introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction to the environment is minimised.
7(vi). Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
The taking of or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited, except by Permit issued in accordance with Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Where taking or harmful interference with animals is involved, the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica should be used as a minimum standard.
7(vii). Collection and removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder
    • Sample material may be collected or removed from the ASPA only in accordance with a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs;
    • Permits shall not be granted if there is a reasonable concern that the sampling proposed would take, displace, remove or damage such quantities of rock, soil, water, or native flora or fauna that their distribution or abundance at Marine Plain would be significantly affected. Excavation of fossils is exempted from this requirement; and
    • Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of the removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ. In this event, the appropriate national authority should be notified.
7(viii). Disposal of waste
All wastes, including all human wastes, shall be removed from the ASPA.
7(ix). Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Plan of Management can continue to be met
    • Permits may be granted to enter the ASPA to carry out monitoring and site inspections, which may involve the small-scale collection of samples for analysis or review, or for protective measures.
    • Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
    • To help maintain the geological, palaeontologic, geomorphological, biological, limnological, and scientific values of Marine Plain, persons shall take special care walking or skiing over slopes, moraines, rock exposures and diatomite soil. To minimise the risk of damage to these values, foot traffic to and from, Marine Plain and the plain south of Poseidon Basin and east of Pickard Ridge, shall be restricted wherever possible.
    • To help maintain the ecological and scientific values derived from the relatively low level of human impact within the ASPA, special precautions shall be taken against introductions. Of particular concern are microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils at other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica. To minimise the risk of introductions, footwear and any equipment to be used in the Area shall be thoroughly cleaned – particularly sampling equipment and markers – before entering the ASPA.
    • The closure and securing of excavation sites during and at the completion of an activity should ensure to the extent reasonably possible, stratigraphic integrity is preserved and endolithic communities are maintained. Recommended measures include the placing of excavated soil on polythene sheet of adequate thickness, the replacing of soil/sediment in layers in the order in which it has been removed, the replacing of larger clasts by correct orientation, the removing of unnatural surface irregularities, and the reorientation of rock and till during closure. 
    • Abandoned scientific equipment shall be removed, and excavations rehabilitated, to the maximum extent possible.
7(x). Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal Permit Holder for each Permit issued submits to the appropriate national authority a report on activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form contained in Appendix 4 of Resolution 2 (1998)(CEPI). Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Plan of Management. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be both in any review of the management plan and in organising the scientific use of the Area.

Management Plan For Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. xxx,
Frazier Islands, Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica

1. Description of Values to be Protected
The Frazier Islands, a group of three islands located approximately 16 km offshore from the Australian Casey Station in East Antarctica (Map A) at 66°13’S 110°11’E, is a breeding locality for Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus.
Macronectes giganteus has a world population of approximately 62,000 individuals and is inferred to have sustained a population reduction of at least 20% over the last 60 years. The species is in continued rapid decline.1 The population of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands is the largest known in the continental Antarctic2. The most recent estimate of the population was 248 breeding pairs in 2001/023. Breeding colonies of Southern Giant Petrels are found on all three of the Frazier Islands (Nelly, Dewart and Charlton Islands). The largest breeding population is found on Dewart Island (Map B), with smaller colonies on Nelly and Charlton Islands. 
The Frazier Islands are one of only four known breeding localities of Southern Giant Petrels around the coastline of continental Antarctica and are the only site in nearly 3000 km of coastline between Davis station and Dumont d’Urville. The other three continental breeding colonies are located near the Australian stations of Mawson (67º36’S, 62º53’E) (Giganteus Island) and Davis (68º35’S, 77º58’E) (Hawker Island), and near the French station Dumont d’Urville (66º40’S, 140º01’E) in Terre Adélie4. The Southern Giant Petrels on the Antarctic continent comprise less than 1% of the global breeding population5. The current population for continental Antarctica is estimated at approximately 290 pairs, comprised of 3 pairs on Giganteus Island, 25 pairs on Hawker Island, 16 pairs at Pointe Géologie archipelago (Terre Adélie) and 248 pairs on the Frazier Islands6.
The breeding season for Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands usually commences between late October and mid November, and extends through to April with their departure northward for the winter (Murray and Luders 1990). Chicks from the Frazier Islands disperse throughout the Southern Hemisphere, with banded chicks recovered in New Zealand, South America, Easter Island, and South Africa within nine months of departure (summarised in Murray and Luders 1990). 
The global breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels is listed as Vulnerable under IUCN criteria (Table 1) and is estimated at around 31,300 pairs7. A total of 30 populations contain 500 or fewer breeding pairs, and at 15 of these sites there are 50 or fewer breeding pairs8. In the previous three generations, the global population has decreased by 20-50%9.

Following its discovery in 1955, the breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands decreased until the early 1980s (Appendix 1). The estimated total breeding population at the Frazier Islands in the mid 1950s was approximately 250 pairs (Appendix 1). The population decreased by approximately 80% and was visited six times, or once every 4-5 years between discovery in 1955 and the recorded population minimum of 57 pairs in 1982. The population has increased since 1982 with more than 200 nests recorded in 1998/99, and almost 248 nests in 2001/02. Most other breeding populations are decreasing10. 
Breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels are highly sensitive to human disturbance at their colonies. It has been suggested that visits to the colonies to band adults and chicks contributed to the decreases recorded11. Reductions in breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels at other locations in the Antarctic and Subantarctic have been attributed to activities associated with stations12. The bycatch of Southern Giant Petrels in longline fisheries operating in the Southern Ocean is also likely to have contributed to observed population decreases13. Decreases in breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels have also been observed at sites where human disturbance has been minimal, such as Heard Island14. 
Apart from visits for seabird censuses, the Frazier Islands have been visited relatively infrequently. Twenty-three visits, or on average one visit every two years has occurred since 1956 (see Appendix 1). In the mid 1980s, a management strategy was implemented for all three breeding localities in the vicinity of Australian Stations to minimise human disturbance to breeding colonies of Southern Giant Petrels. The strategy involved the Australian Antarctic Division restricting census visits to one in every three to five year period and implementing tight administrative controls over all other visits. The interval was considered an appropriate compromise between the risk of disturbance to breeding birds from censuses and the need to obtain meaningful population data. The strategy is believed to have contributed to the stabilisation and recovery observed in two of the three populations in Eastern Antarctica during the late 1980s onwards. 
The recent increase in the breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands in contrast to global trends, combined with the apparent positive effects of the existing management strategy, suggests that continued and formalised protection of Southern Giant Petrel breeding colonies may be warranted. Long-term protection and monitoring of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands will contribute to the development of appropriate regional and global conservation strategies for the species and will provide information for comparisons with populations elsewhere.
2.	Aims and Objectives
Management of the Frazier Islands aims to:
    • minimise human disturbance to the breeding colonies of Southern Giant Petrels to assist stabilisation and recovery of the population in the wild;
    • conserve the Frazier Islands as a reference area for future comparative studies with other breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels;
    • minimise the possibility of the introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Frazier Islands; and
    • preserve the Frazier Islands, henceforth, as a highly restricted area by limiting human visitation to the islands during the Southern Giant Petrel breeding season.
3.	Management Activities
The following management activities shall be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • one research visit should be conducted to census the Southern Giant Petrels and other seabird populations in each 5 year period to enable monitoring of breeding populations. These visits are to be conducted by two people, one of whom should be a bird biologist associated with an approved national program(s) or who has had previous field experience with Southern Giant Petrels;
    • information on the location of the Frazier Islands ASPA (stating the restrictions that apply) shall be produced and prominently displayed at Casey Station and copies of this Management Plan shall be available at the station. Informative material and the Management Plan shall be provided to ships visiting the vicinity;
    • clothing (particularly all footwear) and field equipment shall be appropriately cleaned before entering the Area; and
    • the Management Plan shall be reviewed at least every five years and updated/modified as required.
4. Period of Designation
Designation is for an indefinite period.

6. Description of the Area
6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features 
The Frazier Islands are located at latitude 66°14’S, longitude 110°10’E 
(Map A). The three islands (Nelly, Dewart and Charlton Island) lie in the eastern part of Vincennes Bay approximately 16 km to the west north west of Casey Station. Nelly Island is the largest of the three islands (approximately 0.35 km² in area), and was named for the presence of several colonies of Southern Giant Petrels or “Nellies”. The proposed ASPA comprises the entire terrestrial area of the three islands, with the seaward boundary at the low water mark (Map B). The total area of the Frazier Islands ASPA is approximately 0.6 km². There are no boundary markers. 
Nelly Island supports the largest and most varied avian community of the three islands, with records indicating that Snow Petrels (Pagodroma nivea), Cape Petrels (Daption capense), Antarctic Petrels (Thalassoica antarctica), Wilson’s Storm-Petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), Southern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides), and South Polar Skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) all nest on Nelly Island. South Polar Skua nests have also been found on Dewart Island (Table 3, Map B).
In 1961/62, 100 Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) nests were reported in one colony on Nelly Island15. During the 1989/90 season, three colonies were recorded on the northwest ridge of Nelly Island with a total of 554 nests. The increase corresponds with those recorded for most other Adélie Penguin populations in the Windmill Islands region during the period from 1959/60 to 1989/9016. In the 2001/02 season, approximately 1,000 pairs were estimated to be nesting on Nelly Island17. 
Recorded sightings of marine mammals at the Frazier Islands are scarce; however, in 1968 three Weddell Seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) were observed on an ice floe located between Nelly and Dewart Islands. An Orca (Killer Whale: Orcinus orca) was also sighted offshore from the islands during the same year18. A few Leopard Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) were sighted near Nelly Island and a low number of Weddell Seals were recorded on the sea ice near the Frazier Islands in the 2001/02 season.
Vegetation recorded at Nelly Island comprises at least 11 species, including lichens Buellia frigida, Usnea antarctica, Rhizoplaca melanophthalma, Candelariella flava19, (a terrestrial alga Prasiola crispa, an indeterminate green crust which is thought to be ‘a mixture of fungal hyphae and green alga Desmococcus olivaceus’20, and several species of snow algae including Chlorococcum sp., Chloromonas polyptera, Chlorosarcina antarctica, Prasiococcus calcarius. There are no published records of terrestrial invertebrates on the Frazier Islands; however, no surveys have been carried out21. (Table 3)
The topography of the Frazier Islands is characterised by steep cliffs rising from the sea. The highest peak on Nelly Island is approximately 65 metres. There is a broad ‘U’ shaped ice-filled valley on both Nelly and Dewart Islands. 
The geology of the Frazier Islands is typical of the Windmill Islands group and is characterised by the layered schists and finely crenulated gneisses of the Windmill metamorphics. The geological character of the Frazier Islands developed as a result of two phases of metamorphosis at 1400-1310 Ma and about 1200 Ma of pre-existing volcanics, greywacke and shale. On Nelly Island there are steep cliffs of biotite and gneiss. A red sandstone erratic is located in the ‘U’ shaped valley on Nelly Island below the 30m contour22. Highly polished glacial striae in the gneisses provide evidence of recent glaciation and indicate the former direction of ice flow of 265º and 280º T. Surface sediments consist of fine gravelly sand located in bedrock depressions23.
The climate at the Frazier Islands is characteristic of that experienced at the Windmill Islands and other Antarctic coastal locations in the region. At Casey Station, located 16 kilometres to the ESE of the Frazier Islands group, mean temperatures are 0.3°C for the warmest month and –14.9°C for the coldest month. Precipitation is low and the high albedo of the exposed rock surfaces results in persistent ice-free areas that provide attractive nesting sites for the avifauna.

7. Permit conditions
Visits to the Frazier Islands ASPA are prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by an appropriate National Authority. National Antarctic Programs operating in the region shall consult with each other to ensure that the frequency of visits does not exceed that permitted in the Management Plan. Permits to enter the Area may be issued during the non-breeding period for Southern Giant Petrels, specifically from 
1 May to 30 September, for compelling scientific research that cannot be undertaken elsewhere, or for essential management purposes consistent with the objectives and provisions of the Management Plan. Permits are only to be issued for research that will not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the Area, or interfere with existing scientific studies.
Only one Permit is to be issued for the purpose of conducting a seabird census in each 5 year period. The Permit issuing authority is to refer to the provision under the first dot point of section 3 of this management plan when issuing Permits. Censuses are to be conducted from outside the Giant Petrel colonies, wherever practicable. In most cases there are vantage points from where the nesting birds may be counted. The maximum time to be spent on the Frazier Islands is 12 hours in total; however, the census may involve several visits to the islands. Only the two persons named in the Permit may be ashore within the Area at any time. The boat operator and others should remain at the shoreline for safety reasons. 
Permits should include a condition that the Permit or a copy shall be carried at all times when within the Area. Additional conditions, consistent with the objectives and provisions of the Management Plan, may be included by the issuing authority. The principal Permit Holder for each Permit issued should be required to submit to the Permit issuing authority a visit report detailing all activities undertaken within the Area, and including all census data obtained during the visit.
7(i) Access to, and movement within or over the Area
Vehicles are prohibited within the Area:
    • the only permitted access to the Frazier Islands is by watercraft (Appendix 2). Landings must be made at the designated sites as marked on Map C. Boats used to visit the islands must be left at the shoreline and movement within the Area is by foot only. Only personnel who are required to carry out scientific/management work in the Area should leave the landing site;
    • no IRBs (inflatable rubber boats) are to be operated on the plane and no watercraft is to be operated in excess of 5 knots boat speed within 750m (2500 ft) of the Frazier Islands (Map C); 
    • any movement within the Area is to be consistent with the minimum approach distances to nesting birds specified in Appendix 3. Persons shall not approach closer than is necessary to obtain census data or biological data from any nesting Southern Giant Petrels, and in no case closer than 20m; and
    • to reduce disturbance to wildlife, noise levels including verbal communication is to be kept to a minimum. The use of motor-driven tools and any other activity likely to generate noise and thereby cause disturbance to nesting birds is prohibited within the Area during the breeding period for Southern Giant Petrels (1 October to 30 April).
Aircraft may be used subject to the following conditions:
    • aircraft operations within 2500 ft (750m) horizontally and vertically of the islands for single engine aircraft and 5000 ft (1500m) horizontally and vertically for double-engine aircraft, are prohibited during the breeding season for Southern Giant Petrels (1 October to 30 April): Map C and Appendix 2;
    • aircraft (including helicopter) overflights for aerial photography within the distances specified above are allowed at intervals of 5 years, consistent with guidelines to reduce disturbance. In such cases, the approach to the Frazier Islands should be from a west or north-west direction given the prevailing easterly winds;
    • landing of aircraft in the Area is prohibited at any time;
    • refuelling is prohibited within the Area at any time.
7(ii) Activities which are, or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place
The following activities may be conducted within the Area from 1 May to 30 September as authorised in a Permit;
    • scientific research consistent with the Management Plan for the Area that will not jeopardise the values for which the Area has been designated or the ecosystems of the Area;
    • compelling management activities, including monitoring; and
    • sampling, which should be the minimum required for approved research programs.
Exceptions to restrictions outlined in the management plan are in an emergency as specified in Article 11 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol).
7(iii) Installation, modification, or removal of structures
No permanent structures are to be erected in the Area.
7(iv) Location of field camps
Camping is prohibited in the Frazier Islands ASPA except in an emergency.
7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms that may be brought into the Area
    • Fuel is not to be depoted on the islands. Boat refuelling is permitted at shoreline landing sites. A small amount of fuel is permitted for an emergency stove.
    • No poultry products, including dried food containing egg powder, are to be taken into the Area.
    • No herbicides or pesticides are to be brought into the Area.
    • Any chemical which may be introduced for compelling scientific purposes as authorised in a Permit shall be removed from the Area, at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted. The use of radio-nuclides or stable isotopes is prohibited.
    • No animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and precautions shall be taken against accidental introductions. All equipment and clothing should be thoroughly cleaned before entering the Area.
7(vi) Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
    • Taking of, or harmful interference with, native flora and fauna, is prohibited unless specifically authorised by permit issued in accordance with Article 3 of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
    • Disturbance of Southern Giant Petrels should be avoided at all times. 
7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder
    • Material may only be collected or removed from the Area as authorised in a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.
    • Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of the removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ. If such material is found the appropriate Authority must be notified.
7(viii) Disposal of waste
No wastes, including human wastes, are to be deposited or left in the Area.
7(ix) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the management plan continue to be met
    • A census of Southern Giant Petrels should be conducted in each 5 year period. Censuses of other species may be undertaken during this visit provided no additional disturbance is caused to the Southern Giant Petrels.
    • The length of time to be spent at the Frazier Islands to conduct a bird census should be minimised; e.g. a survey should be able to be completed in approximately a 12 hour period. 
    • Novel GPS data shall be obtained for specific sites of long-term monitoring for lodgement with the Antarctic Master Directory through the appropriate National Authority.
7(x) Requirement for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal Permit Holder for each permit issued submits to the appropriate national authority a report on activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form contained in Appendix 4 of Resolution 2 (1998)(CEP I). Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Plan of Management. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be both in any review of the Plan of Management and in organising the scientific use of the Area. A copy of the report should be forwarded to the National Party responsible for development of the Management Plan to assist in management of the Area, and monitoring of bird populations, additionally visit reports should provide detailed information on census data, locations of any new colonies or nests not previously recorded, a brief summary of research findings and copies of photographs taken of the Area
