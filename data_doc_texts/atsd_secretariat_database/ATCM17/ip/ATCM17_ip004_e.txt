ANTARCTIC TOURISM: 1991-1992            

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)
ANTARCTIC TOURISM:  1991-92 SUMMER SEASON

(Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom)

The greatest numbers of tourists in the Antarctic were recorded during the 1991-92 summer season (Fig 1).
Approximately 6,500 tourists entered the Antarctic Treaty Area aboard ships, yachts and aircraft. More than 97% of
these tourists travelled aboard cruise ships and yachts (Fig 2). Twelve ships carried tourists aboard 54 Antarctic
cruises during the 1991-92 season.  This activity represents a 34% increase over the previous record high of more than
4,800 Antarctic tourists during the 1990-91 season.

Tables 1-2 and Appendix I provide information on Antarctic tourism during the 1991-92 season.  Tables 3-4 provide a
record of tourist numbers over time. (Data compiled by D Enzenbacher, Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge).

More Yachts with Fare-paying Passengers

Yachts have carried fare-paying passengers to the Antarctic during 
previous seasons, but an increase in this activity was noted 
during the 1991-92 season. Table 2 provides details.

Notes:  'Ksar' reportedly turned back before reaching Antarctica, 
therefore its passengers were not counted. 'Oviri' 
planned to winter-over in the Antarctic, but encountered 
engine trouble and diverted to South Georgia. 'Tradewind' 
totals are estimated.

* During the 1981-82 season the total number of seaborne tourists 
reported by US tour operators in the Antarctic was 1,130.  Of 
these 1,130 tourists, 510 flew one or both ways to/from 
Presidente Frei Station as part of a tour package offered by 
Transoceanica, Santiago de Chile which chartered the 'World 
Discoverer' from 31 December 1981 until 20 January 1982.
