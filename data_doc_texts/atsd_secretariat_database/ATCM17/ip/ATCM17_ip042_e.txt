                                 INTRODUCTION 

The research projects of which 1992-93 field activities are presented in this report form part
of the Belgian Scientific Research Programme on Antarctica. The implementation and
management of it are assigned to the Science Policy Office. This co-ordinated multi-annual
research effort was initiated in 1985 by the Belgian Government with the aim at contributing
towards the widening of the scientific knowledge of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean.

The implementation of the ongoing phase of the Programme, namely the third (1992-95), was
decided by the Council of Ministers in its meeting of 25 June 1992. Based on the Programme's
result so far, the research work was developed to address the protection of the Antarctic
environment - including the rational management of its living resources - and to the
assessment of the mechanisms through which the Antarctic and the global climate interact.
With a concern of effectiveness, the third phase of the Programme focuses on some scientific
goals internationally recognized as first-order priorities in line with that problematics.
Emphasis is given on a multi-disciplinary approach of the dynamics of the global functioning
of Antarctic main natural systems and of their evolution and interactions, making use of
mathematical modelling.

The third phase encompasses the following topics:

■ ECODYNAMICS OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE CLIMATE:
  ▲ Biogeochemical fluxes and cycles in the main trophic compartments;
  ▲ Development of tools for modelling the global dynamics of ecosystems;
  ▲ Assessment of the role of "new production" in the burial of atmospheric CO2.

■ EVOLUTION AND PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM:
  ▲ Application of predictive ecological models to simulate the response of the ecosystem
    to climatic disturbances connected to human activities;
  ▲ Study of the dispersion of hydrocarbons spills.

■ ROLE OF THE ANTARCTIC IN GLOBAL CHANGE:
  ▲ Ocean-Atmosphere-Cryosphere interactions;
  ▲ Sedimentary paleo-environment.

Since the beginning of the Programme the Belgian research teams got closely involved in an
international network of co-operation up to the point that for now, joint-research projects are
being commonly implemented with other Antarctic Treaty member countries and in particular
with Australia, France, FRG, Italy, Japan and United Kingdom.

Further information on the goals, contents and achievements of phases II and III of the
Programme are given in the along with annual progress report.

1 INTRODUCTION

In its meeting of 25 June 1992, the Council of Ministers approved the implementation of 
the **third phase of the Scientific Research Programme on Antarctica** to develop further the 
co-ordinated research effort initiated by Belgium since 1985. A budget of 126,000,000 BEF 
is being allotted to this three-year phase. The Science Policy Office - Prime Minister's 
Services were assigned the task of carrying out the Programme's co-ordination and 
management. The technical content of Phase III was designed in such a way as to centre 
the whole of the research effort on some those of the scientific topics most relevant to the 
protection of the Antarctic environment and to the unravelling of the role of Antarctica 
in the Earth's climate.

For now, the previous phase of the Programme, namely the second one, can be considered 
as fully achieved as planned, all the research projects having been completed since the end 
of 1991 - beginning of 1992. The record of activities presented here will thus focus on the 
achievements of the research implemented during the second phase of the Programme.

2 RECORD OF ACTIVITIES (ACHIEVEMENTS OF PHASE II OF THE PROGRAMME)

2.1  PLANKTON ECOLOGY

2.1.1 Primary production and nutritive potential for herbivores

Dr G. BILLEN - ULB

Detailed biological measurements were carried out in the marginal ice zone of the 
northwestern Weddell Sea during sea ice retreat 1988 (EPOS expedition, Legs 1 and 
2). These measurements clearly showed enhanced phyto-, bacterio- and protozoo-
plankton production in the marginal ice zone, as compared to adjacent open sea and 
permanently ice-covered areas. The physical processes associated with ice retreat 
enhance the development of phytoplankton blooms at the receding ice-edge by 
providing phytoplankton cells with optimal light conditions owing to the formation of 
shallow vertically stable surface layer as a result of meltwater production.

The magnitude of the bloom is regulated by the combined action of grazing pressure 
by protozoa, mesozooplankton and krill and meteorological conditions, the latter 
determining the vertical stability of surface waters. The relative importance of 
micro-and mesograzers in controlling phytoplankton ice-edge blooms, and hence the 
structure of the planktonic food-web, is determined both by the composition of sea-
ice assemblages at the time of ice melting and the presence beneath the ice of 
overwintering krill and mesozooplankton. The former depends on the initial 
composition of sea-ice assemblages originating from planktonic and benthic auto- and

heterotrophic microorganisms scavenged at the time of ice formation, the physico-
chemical characteristics of the ice habitat and the environmental light conditions of 
early spring. Overwintering herbivorous underneath the ice, by grazing selectively on 
large phytoplankton like some diatoms and Phaeocystis colonies or their aggregates 
strongly determine the species composition of the seeded microbial population and 
hence the structure of the planktonic food-web developing at the receding ice-edge. 
In the presence of krill, a very efficient microbial network composed of nano-sized 
auto- and heterotrophs thus predominates and moderate phytoplankton ice-edge 
blooms are expected. On the contrary, in the absence of overwintering krill, large 
blooms dominated by micro-sized phytoplanktonic species should prevail.

The extent of the bloom in ice-free area is determined by local meteorological 
conditions, in particular the frequency and intensity of wind mixing events, and by 
passage of krill swarms. The impact of the latter on the structure of the planktonic 
food-web, whilst episodic, is dramatic as these grazers very clear the water from 
phytoplankton, heterotrophic microorganisms and copepods. Only bacterial activity 
is enhanced after a krill event, owing to the release of organic matter resulting from 
the feeding activity of these grazers.

Thus, although the enhancement of ice-edge blooms by the physics associated to the 
process of ice melting is a general feature in the circumpolar marginal ice zone of 
the Southern Ocean, regional differences in the magnitude and extent of these blooms 
are however to be expected, depending on the geographical distribution of overwinter-
ing and pelagic krill. Our observations suggest that large diatoms and Phaeocystis 
occur occasionally in the Ross Sea and Prydz Bay area whilst moderate ice-edge 
blooms of nanophytoplankton prevail in the Weddell Sea. In the marginal ice zone of 
the northwestern Weddell sea were able to show the existence in this area of a very 
efficient complex microbial network, with nano-sized protozoa grazing on 
phytoplankton and bacteria. Application in this area of a coupled hydrodynamical-
biological model established from physical and biological processes measurements 
carried out during the EPOS cruise stress the quantitative importance of protozoa 
as regulator of ice-edge phytoplankton blooms, as link between krill and microorganisms 
and as important ammonium regenerator, inducing a shift from a nitrate- to an 
ammonium-based primary production system.

Carbon budget calculation reveals the quantitative importance of heterotrophic 
microorganisms in the fate of primary production: 88% of net primary production is 
assimilated by the microbial loop composed of bacteria, baccivorous nanoflagellates 
and protozoa. Among the latter protozoa that ingest as high as 61% of the primary 
production play a key role, both by linking krill and other mesozooplankton to 
microorganisms, and by regenerating ammonium. Total net microbial food web 
secondary production contributes 66% of the food resources available to krill and 
other mesozooplankton at the receding ice edge. Ammonium released through the 
metabolic activity induces a shift from nitrate-based primary production system in 
the ice-covered area to an ammonium-based one in the ice-free area. Similar budget 
calculated for the adjacent permanently open sea area magnifies the key role of 
protozoa, constituting as much as 88% of resource available to krill and other 
mesozooplankton. Extrapolation of these calculations to the entire Southern Ocean 
(bordered at the Antarctic convergence), considering the seasonal variations of the 
sea ice cover, yields a value of 1.85 GT C for annual net primary production.

2.1.2   Biochemistry and ecodynamics of zooplankton

Dr J.-H. HECQ - ULg

The mechanisms of distribution and biochemical speciation of primary production in
relation to abiotic parameters of the environment were studied to assessing the
evolution of the lipidic content of zooplankton and krill. A conceptual model of these
phenomena has been established to evaluate the nutritional quality of the pelagic food
web (lipidic content).

The study at mesoscale of the ice edge and of the adjacent open water, where the
development of spring blooms of phytoplankton is expected, has been particularly
emphasized, both in the Weddell Sea and in the Ross Sea.

The interpretation of the whole set of data collected in October-November 1998
during EPOS leg 1 in the Weddell Sea showed that the vertical stratification and the
horizontal distribution of water masses are the main factors controlling the
development of phytoplankton blooms occurring at the ice edge in early spring. On
the other hand, the paucity of zooplankton abundance and the least lipidic contents
of it, probably stemming from the overwintering, do not support the idea of a general
lipid richness in Antarctic zooplankton.

The analysis of combined sets of biological, biochemical and physico-chemical data
collected from November 1988 to February 1989 during the Vth ITALIANTARTIDE
expedition on board of the R/V Cariboo in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean
and in the Ross Sea enabled to define the quantitative synoptic evolution of
planktonic communities in relation with the ice retreat phenomenon. Among the most
relevant clues drawn from that cruise it is worth pointing out the close time-
dependence of the phytoplankton contents in pigments (measured by HPLC) on the
process of seawater ice-freezing. Moreover, liposoluble components, like phaeophorbid-
es and fatty acids, and ammonia concentrations in the water column showed to be
reliable tracers of zooplankton activity. Their distribution seems to follow a pattern
similar to that exhibited by the zooplankton nutritional activity. In addition, the
vertical distribution of zooplankton and krill play a key role in the control of the
distribution of all planktonic organic material present in the water column and in the
recycling mechanisms occurring in the euphotic zone or in deeper layers.

Observations carried out in February-March 1991 in the waters surrounding the tip of
South America and especially throughout the Magellan Strait (ITALIANTARTIDE 91
cruise) led to similar conclusions regarding the relation between the structure and
lipidic content of planktonic communities, the recycling of organic matter and the sea
ice retreat process.

2.1.3  Ecotoxicology and plankton activity

Dr C. JOIRIS - VUB

Concentrations and transfer mechanisms of stable pollutants were studied in the main 
biological compartments of the Southern Ocean. Data were gathered on heavy metals, 
total and organic (methyl) mercury and organochlorines (pesticides and PCBs).

The contamination of phytoplankton (suspended particulate matter samples) both by 
PCBs and by total mercury is higher than expected, a reflection of the existence of 
important sources of contamination in the southern hemisphere reaching the Antarctic 
marine ecosystems through atmospheric transport. At the ecosystem level, the loads 
are about six times lower than in the North Sea. Due to that lower biomass present 
in the Antarctic, however, and the direct contamination of particulate matter from 
the water (adsorption, absorption and partition on the lipids), concentrations expressed 
per weight unit are as high in Antarctica as in the North Sea.

This high concentration of Hg and PCBs could cause a high contamination of the 
higher trophic levels, if indirect contamination through the food were the main 
contamination mechanism for fish. Since this is not so (contamination of fish is low, 
compared with North Sea levels), one must on the contrary conclude that direct 
contamination of fish plays an important role. These field observations confirm 
conclusions obtained in the laboratory after exposure to low PCB concentration. By 
comparing the Antarctic and North Sea ecosystems, indeed, one can detect the 
relative importance of direct and indirect uptakes in nature: for indirect contamina-
tion, one expects comparable contamination levels in both ecosystems, since the 
concentrations are of the same level in particulate matter. For direct contamination 
from the water, on the contrary, one expects six times lower concentrations in 
Antarctic fish, since the ecosystem - and thus the water - contamination is six times 
lower than in the North Sea.

This is why, the contamination of fish being six times lower in Antarctica, we 
concluded to the existence of an important direct contamination mechanism. Seabirds' 
contamination is of course indirect. Since their food (dish) is less contaminated in the 
Antarctic, it is normal to determine lower levels in the seabirds as well.

From the practical point of view, however, one must consider that contamination is 
recent and still increasing in the Antarctic, while it is older and probably stabilized 
or decreasing in northern industrialized regions like Western Europe and North 
America.

2.2     MARINE GEOCHEMISTRY

2.2.1   Vertical transfer of biogenic compounds

Dr F. DEHAIRS - VUB

The observed evolutions in nitrate depletion and in f-ratio allow for the description
of a general nitrogen flux pattern. At the start of the growth season phytoplankton
exclusively assimilates nitrate. The faster the ice cover melts the higher the nitrate
depletion rate and the larger the PN stock in the euphotic layer. The amounts of
nitrate removed from the upper layer vary considerably in the different subareas. The
MIZ and CCSZ are characterized by huge nitrate depletions, exceeding the ones
measured in the CPIZ by at least one order of magnitude. In the OOZ, as well as in
the POOZ, an intermediate situation prevails. After a short early phase, the
ammonium availability increases and autotrophic organisms switch from new to
regenerated production. The measured ammonium availabilities show the same trend
as the nitrate depletions: very high values in the MIZ and CCSZ, very low values in
the CPIZ and intermediate ones in the OOZ. The increasing importance of regener-
ated nutrients in primary production is mainly driven by phytoplankton preference
after remineralization processes supplied more and more ammonium. Nevertheless,
the nitrate pool never becomes exhausted and nitrate assimilation still contributes for
about one third of the total inorganic nitrogen uptake. This scenario with initial and
very high uptake of nitrate, followed by a drastic change after the ammonium
availability increased is clearly confirmed by the MIZ study (EPOS LEG 2) and the
CCSZ study (Marine Science Voyage 6) and to a lesser degree by the results of the
CPIZ study (EPOS Leg 2 and ANTARKTIS IX/2). In literature it is often emphasized
that regenerated production is characteristic for nano- and picosized phytoplankton
mainly consisting of flagellates. While nanoflagellates became indeed the predomi-
nant phytoplankton group in the Scotia-Weddell Confluence area, large diatoms
remained predominant in the Prydz Bay area.

For the MIZ and CCSZ regions it is likely that the initial growth surge, sustained by
nitrate uptake, triggered the fast development of the grazers (mainly micrograzers
for the MIZ; micrograzers and copepods for the CCSZ). This resulted in high
ammonium production rates and the phytoplankton switched from nitrate to
ammonium assimilation. This reflects a typical retention system with reduced export
to subsurface layers and extremely low build-up of subsurface barite stocks. The
phytoplankton community structure does not necessarily change as a result of this
change in production type, as indicated by maintained diatom dominance in Prydz
Bay. However, if krill, the typical K-strategist comes on stage, the phytoplankton
composition can completely change as a result of the very high grazing pressure.

In the other subregions (POOZ, OOZ, CPIZ) no intense blooms develop and as a result
no significant grazing develops. Therefore, production of ammonium is not as large
as observed for MIZ and CCSZ and nitrate contribution in phytoplankton nutrition
remains relatively high (f-ratios ≥0.5). These systems have export to the subsurface
layers, as witnessed by the build-up of barite stocks and the decrease of oxygen in
subsurface waters. The export is carried by aggregates and solitary particles since
grazing is kept low.

SCIENCE POLICY OFFICE                                  BELGIAN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAMME ON ANTARCTICA

The main question is then why do these intense blooms develop in specific areas, such as the MIZ and the CCSZ? Is it ice melting and ensuing stabilisation of the water column with the installation of a shallow mixed layer, or does the enhanced presence of trace elements such as Fe have an effect? That Fe might have an impact is suggested by elevated subsurface concentrations of lithogenic compounds (reflected in the presence of Al) in the Confluence area and the inner shelf area of Prydz Bay.

In situations with significant export it is shown that its magnitude is reflected in the seasonal build-up of subsurface barite and consumption of oxygen. Net changes in suspended barite stocks can therefore be used to estimate the export of production to subsurface waters. We emphasize that the export towards the subsurface depths is significant in regions where grazing pressure (unless exerted by krill) is small. These are not the regions characterized as retention systems, where high productivities induce enhances grazing pressure.

2.3     MARINE GEOPHYSICS

2.3.1   Evolution of peri-Antarctic sedimentary basins

Dr M. DE BATIST - RUG

Seismic profiles performed in the passive continental margin of the eastern and southeastern Weddell Sea and in the active margin of the northwestern Antarctic Peninsula were analyzed along with tectonical, stratigraphical and additional geophysical data to gain a better insight in the structure and evolution of the geological processes characteristics of those areas.

The seismic grid already available in the Weddell Sea was expanded with about 4100 km of high-resolution reflection seismic profiles during the Antarktis VIII/5 cruise (December 1989 - March 1990), which was again a joint AWI/RCMG expedition. Also during this cruise, a basic seismic processing routine was applied to all available Weddell Sea data.

The Meso-Cenozoic seismostratigraphic model, defined on ODP Site 693 (Leg 113) has been extended throughout the existing seismic database along the entire eastern Weddell Sea continental margin. This correlation effort provides some closer time constraints on different stratigraphic units elsewhere in the Weddell Sea a.o., within the Crary Fan depositional system. A major unconformity (WO4) reflects important erosive and tectonic events at the Meso-Cenozoic boundary, which could be attributed to the existence of a structurally controlled Late Mesozoic Transantarctic seaway. Such implies palaeoceanographic control on the development of at least some of the Mesozoic Weddell Sea unconformities. The Cenozoic unconformities are well controlled by paleoclimatic factors.

A structural analysis of the seismic data provides new insights in the possible origin of the Explora Escarpment and the associated Outer high, as well as in the development of the Wegener Canyon. The "Polarstern Bank" is a major structural

feature that has been discovered during the ANTARKTIS VIII/5 cruise. Its presence 
is evaluated in view of the prevailing models for the initial break-up of Gondwana, 
which assume a major structural lineament throughout the Weddell Sea, connecting 
the Explora Escarpment and the Andenes Chain.

The high-resolution seismic database in the southeastern Weddell Sea yields new 
insights in the detailed and fine-scale sequence stratigraphic structure and build-up 
of the entire Crary fan depositional system, from the proximal parts on the 
continental slope to the distal parts in the Polarstern Bank area. The sedimentary 
processes, such as channel-levee deposition and depocentre migration, are discussed, 
as well as the fan system's development through time and as a response to eustatic 
sea-level fluctuations. On base of a good-quality seismic profile, connecting the shelf 
deposits (off Halley Bay) with the fan area, a climatic-eustatic controlled sedimen-
tation model is advanced, explaining the development of the entire southeastern 
Weddell Sea continental margin since mid-Oligocene times.

Further interpretation has been carried out of the seismic data of the northwestern 
Antarctic Peninsula, which are covering the rift basin of Bransfield Strait, an 
elongated sediment-filled trough interpreted as a fore-arc basin, accretional and 
progradational slopes, recent and ancient trench environments and the facing oceanic 
domain. In this oceanic domain, different fracture zones have highly contrasting 
morphological and geophysical expressions. The subduction of a fracture zone like 
Hero F.Z., characterized by a significant relief possibly related to the presence of 
buoyant (serpentinite) ridges, may have been a factor of subduction termination for 
the last segment of the Aluk (Drake) plate. It may also have played a role in the 
separation of a blue schist-bearing fragment (Smith Island) from the base if the 
accretionary plate margin and in its lift to the surface.

The magnetic anomaly pattern of the oceanic slabs facing the northwestern Peninsula 
margin shows evidence of an intriguing spreading acceleration, which apparently 
preceded ridge-trench collision. The same anomaly pattern provides a clue to the 
stratigraphic interpretation of the oceanic sediment cover and of the frontal part of 
the prograding, now passive margin south of the South Shetland Island Arc.

An apparently broken and tided oceanic plate fragment, squeezed between the South 
Shetland Trench and Schackleton F.Z., may argue for the role of transgression 
associated with the oblique convergence of the Antarctic and Scotia plates.

2.4 GLACIOLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY

2.4.1 Chemical and isotopic distribution in congelated ice

Prof. R. SOUCHEZ - ULB

The two main factors that influence the isotopic and chemical signals in ice during 
a water/ice phase change are the freezing rate and the characteristics of the parent 
water.

1992 PROGRESS REPORT                                 - 7 -
SCIENCE POLICY OFFICE                                  BELGIAN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAMME ON ANTARCTICA

A numerical model has been developed to study isotope and element distribution in 
ice during water freezing at varying freezing rates from a liquid phase experiencing 
changes resulting only from the development of the ice and the consequent 
fractionation occurring at the interface. It depends upon the choice of a distribution 
coefficient respectively, >1 or <1.

The numerical model was adapted for both finite and semi-infinite reservoirs. Using 
an axis moving with the ice front, the operating processes being described by partial 
differential equations and by fixing upper and lower boundary conditions for the 
boundary layer situated near the interface. Ionic redistribution during water freezing 
has been experimentally studied to test the model and like our previous work on 
isotopes, this study showed to be in reasonable agreement with the theoretical 
developments.

Chemical and isotopic profiles fluctuating in opposite ways are the signatures of the 
dominant role played by a freezing rate effect. However, when sea ice formation is 
governed by thermodynamic rather than dynamic processes, such distributions are not 
always present. The isotopic and chemical characteristics of multi-year sea ice 
sampled in a rift of George VI Ice Shelf can only be understood if changes in parent 
water properties during the sea ice cover formation are taken into account. The 
dominating role of parent water effects over freezing rate effects results in 
sympathetic fluctuations between the two profiles: when ice is enriched in heavy 
isotopes, it is also enriched in salts and the reverse is equally true even at a small 
scale. In the rift of George VI Ice Shelf, variable mixing of sea water with meltwater 
form basal shelf ice plays the major role in explaining the distributions.

Isotopic (δD and δ^(18)O), total gas, CO_(2) content with ice texture and fabric and SEM 
measurements have been used to study the debris-rich basal ice from the CAROLINE 
ice core and from the area of Moraine Prudhomme in Terre Adelie. The results shed 
some light on the process of basal ice formation in this region of Antarctica under 
subfreezing temperature conditions at the ice-bedrock interface and document further 
changes due to the presence of liquid water at crystal boundaries at these tempera-
tures.

2.4.2    Oceanic model of sea ice

Prof. J. BERLAMONT - KUL

To carry on numerical study of wind and density induced currents in the Antarctic 
coastal zones two numerical models have been developed. The first one can be 
described as a vertical plane (2.5D) baroclinic model. The second one falls into the 
class of fully 3D models. The 2.5D model has been applied to simulate the upwelling 
along a shelf break in an ice covered and stratified water. The second application as 
well as the 3D model application has as subject the flow structure due to katabatic 
wind forcing.

It was not possible to compare the results of the models with measurements since 
that they are very scarce for Antarctic waters. Another possibility for evaluating the 
model performance is to test it with other models or with applications for which

1992 PROGRESS REPORT

validation data are available. The "katabatic wind" results of the 2.5D model have 
been compared to the results of another model and to a (simplified) analytical 
solution. All the three results show an general agreement and we can conclude that 
the 2.5D model is well simulating the ocean circulation.

To judge the quality of the results of the 3D model it was first applied to a simple 
test case. The results were encouraging us to start more complex applications. One 
difficulty encountered during the development of the 3D model was concerning the 
definition of (open) boundary conditions. The problem was related with the solution 
of the pressure equation. For some applications the model was unstable, it was found 
that this is related with the explicit definition of the Coriolis parameter. To avoid 
these problems the Coriolis term must be made (semi-) implicit.

The choice between a 2.5D model and a 3D model is related to the specific problem. 
For the two "katabatic wind" applications it is clear that the wind field is a 
consequence of the complex geometry and topography of the area. The flow field for 
the Terra Nova area can only be modelled correctly by a fully 3D model. The 2.5D 
model however remains a tool that can give a good idea about the flow structure. 
Although the simulations treated here are all related to a very specific phenomenon 
occurring in some particular zones of the Southern Ocean other applications of the 
models are possible. The models have been developed so that they are general enough 
to be applied to other water bodies.

2.4.3    Thermodynamic and kinematic model of sea ice

Dr G. PICHOT - MUMM

The goal of this study was the development of a 3D model coupling a thermodynamic 
sea ice model with a hydrodynamic circulation model. In the first part, we have 
improved some features of the SEAICE model. The main modifications have been 
brought in the evolution of the mixed layer. Consequently, the oscillations in the time 
behaviour of the mixed layer have disappeared.

Different simulations have underlined the sensitivity of the results to the salinity. 
This is the reason we have changed the expression of the salt exchanges between the 
ice and the mixed layer to better respect the conservation of total salt. With this 
reviewed model, we have made several simulations. The pictures presents the time 
or space evolution of the more representative parameters and prove the good global 
behaviour of the SEAICE model. A hypothetical atmospheric warming causes the 
diminution of the ice area: the model reacts thus as we can hope.

In general, we have thus resolved the problems explained in Demuth (1989): the 
thermodynamic part of the SEAICE model is now reliable and ready to be coupled to 
a complete three-dimensional model.

With the purpose of improving the sea ice dynamics, we have developed two kinds of 
circulation models.

The 2.5D model is applied to antarctic conditions. The results are compared to a similar model developed by the UCL's team. The velocity profiles obtained when the katabatic wind is blowing are in good agreement with the ones given by the exact Ekman solution if we use a vertical discretization sufficiently accurate.

Then, we have extended the 2.5D model to a 3D one. The three-dimensional model is applied to simulate the wind driven circulation in the Weddell Sea sector. It reproduces clockwise circulation of the Weddell Sea and the strong north-east currents in the northern part of the Drake Passage. The use of these currents in the SEAICE model yields satisfying ice thicknesses and ice extent.

2.4.4 Ice cap dynamics

Prof. H. DECLEIR - VUB

The dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet become especially important when viewed as a keystone in understanding climatic and sea-level global changes. Several research themes were carried out from that point of view.

■ 3-D Ice Sheet Modelling:
Detailed modelling experiments were carried out with the 3D thermo-mechanical fully coupled time dependent model that was developed during phase I of the Programme -that -in the literature- now generally referred to as the "Huybrechts Model". The sensitivity experiment showed that sea-level is the most important environmental factor causing large-scale variations of the ice sheet during the Quaternary. It also proved that steady state experiments are - due to the significant response time - not well suited for simulating the ice cap geometry in a glacial-interglacial cycle. The dynamical glacial-interglacial experiment generated for the first time a realistic ice sheet geography at different periods of the glacial-interglacial cycle. It indicated among other things that the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to the glacial sea-level lowering might be much lesser than generally assumed. The Greenhouse Experiment confirmed the stable character of the Antarctic ice cap, not supporting the idea of a catastrophic general collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The calculations also indicate that the Antarctic ice sheet is likely to grow for a temperature rise below 5°C.

■ Glaciological constraints on the glacierization of marginal mountain areas:
Recently, interesting glacio-geological evidences related to the glacial evolution of the S¢r Rondane Dronning Maud Land have been collected by Japanese scientists. Glaciological measurements (ice thicknesses, ice velocities) have been carried out by two glaciologists of our team participating in the expeditions JARE 31 and JARE 32. Based on these data a flow line model was implemented to simulate the behaviour of the outlet glaciers in the S¢r Rondane. It confirmed the 300-400 m increase of ice level during the last glacial maximum, as indicated by the geological evidences. The higher glacial surfaces found at different places in the S¢r Rondane must therefore witness the existence of an environment predating this maximum and characterized by much wetter conditions and/or vertical tectonic movements.

■ Satellite monitoring of ice and snow conditions:
Marginal mountain areas such as Sør Rondane constitute ablation islands within the 
accumulation area of Antarctica. Based on multi-temporal Spot imagery, a 
supervised classification technique was used to distinguish permanent snow cover 
from ice surfaces buried underneath snow drift, allowing to display genuine changes 
in bare ice extent, an important issue in using blue ice as indicator of global 
changes.

2.4.5   Atmospheric dynamics and atmosphere-surface interactions

Prof. A. BERGER - UCL

Katabatic wind is a noticeable atmospheric phenomenon, especially in Antarctica, 
where the conditions required for its onset are present during the most part of the 
year. Its impact on the atmosphere-ocean interactions in the polar regions of the 
Southern Hemisphere has been previously mentioned, because the strength of the wind 
is sufficient to maintain open water areas at some places near the coast.

The aim of the present work was to develop a three-dimensional mesoscale 
atmospheric model to simulate katabatic flow in highly complex terrain. In particular, 
it must be a useful tool for the study of the processes governing the katabatic wind 
evolution in Antarctic coastal zones, like in the Terra Nova Bay area. The primitive 
equations were used, including the full continuity equation. The horizontal resolution 
was chosen to be 5 km. The model may be classified as a meso- atmospheric model 
and to the author knowledge, it is the first model of this class that is used to simulate 
Antarctic katabatic winds.

The model has been validated by performing the classical linear and non-linear 
mountain wave experiments. The simulated linear waves are similar to those found 
in the analytical solution of the equations. The linear response of the model is 
numerically very stable, which is very important for the simulation of drainage flows, 
because excessive numerical damping is prohibited. The simulated non-linear waves 
are very comparable to those simulated by other published models.

Then a simulation of katabatic wind was performed for polar night conditions in the 
area of Terra Nova Bay. The simulated fields reproduce many characteristics of the 
observed katabatic flow in this area. A katabatic jet is simulated, and its location is 
in agreement with the observations. Nevertheless, it is not yet sufficiently strong, and 
could be improved by including additional processes like the opening of a Pauline 
forced by the wind and the increase of the negative buoyancy of the katabatic layer 
due to the presence of blowing snow.

3 FIELD ACTIVITIES

Field activities i.e., at sea sampling and measurements, are being achieved in the 
framework of scientific voyages to the Southern Ocean organized by other countries.

Through their involvement in such campaigns, the research teams of the Programme were 
also provided with the unique opporunity to develop or strenghten international co-opera-
tion links. As an outcome, most of the Programme's research projects are increasingly 
contributing to, and taking advantage of, the common implementation of internationally 
integrated studies.

Recorded field activities (April 1991 - March 1992): Two scientists of the Programme 
(phase II) participated to a scientific campaigne to the Southern Ocean organized by the 
FRG (Table I, page 13).

Planned field activities (April 1992 - March 1993): Seven scientists of the Programme 
(phase III) will participate to scientific cruises in the Southern Ocean organized by other 
countries (Table II, page 13).

4 ACTIVITIES LAUNCHED IN 1992

The third phase of the Scientific Research Programme on Antarctica (1992-95) was 
designed to fit in with key environmental and scientific questions of utmost concern to the 
Antarctic Treaty System. Phase III, therefore, aims at contributing to the development of 
the scientific basis for the protection of the Antarctic, including the rational management 
of its marine living resources, and to the assessment of interactions between the Antarctic 
and the global climate. Its technical contents focuses on a multi-disciplinary approach of 
the dynamics of the global functioning of Antarctic main natural systems and of their 
evolution and interactions, making use of mathematical modelling.

The research work encompasses the following domains:

 ECODYNAMICS OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE 
CLIMATE:
  ■ Biogeochemical fluxes and cycles in the main trophic compartments.
  ■ Modelling the global dynamics of ecosystems.
  ■ Assessment of the role of "new production" in the burial of atmospheric CO_(2) by 
      the Southern Ocean.

 EVOLUTION AND PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM:
  ■ Application of predictive ecological models to simulate ecosystem responses to 
      anthropogenic climatic disturbances.
  ■ Study of hydrocarbons spills dispersion.

 ROLE OF THE ANTARCTIC IN GLOBAL CHANGE:
  ■ Ocean-Cryosphere-Atmosphere interactions.
  ■ Sedimentary palaeoenvironment.

Nine research projects were selected as an outcome of an international peer reviewing 
process. The contents and goals of each of them are given hereunder. It is worth noticing 
that given the multi-disciplinary approach of the Programme, several projects cover more 
than one of the above topics.

PROJECT A3/03/001 - Dr F. DEHAIRS - VUB

SPATIAL AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY OF BIOGENIC ELEMENTAL TRANSPORT IN
THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

The project aims at the study of three intensely related fluxes of biogenic matter in the
Southern Ocean ecosystem.

The study of _nutrient regime type_ will include: (i) the use of ^15^N incorporation experiments
(labelled nitrate and labelled ammonium); (ii) the evaluation of nitrate depletions, relative
to the winter concentration, from water column profiles of different geographical locations
sampled at different periods in the season; and (iii) the variability of natural ^15^N
abundances (δ^15^N) in the particulate material. Moreover, the study of the translocation of
^15^N to higher trophic levels (copepods, krill) will provide information on the secondary
production process and indirectly on the release of dissolved organic substrates as a result
of the zooplankton feeding behaviour.

The _recycling processes_ in the upper layer of the water column will be studied by ^15^N
isotope dilution experiments. Ammonium remineralization and nitrification feed the return
flux of inorganic nitrogen; the quantification of both processes provides information on
bacterial and protozoan excretion processes.

Characterization of the _export flux_ is based on the study of the elemental composition of
total suspended matter in the water column, sediment trap material and underlying
sediments. The study of suspended matter elemental composition will be parallelled, whenever possible, with the study of plankton community composition and cell carbon
estimates by the ULB group. Besides particulate carbon and nitrogen, full characterization
obtained by ICP MS investigation and especially tracer element concentrations (as Ba, Ca,
Sr, Si and δ^15^N), will describe origin and fate of the material and to a certain extent
inform on the evolution of the settling matter.

ROLE OF THE MEIOBENTHOS IN ANTARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS

Two main topics will be addressed in this research to assess the role of the meiobenthos
in the process of remineralization: (i) the biomass budget (POC/DOC) at the
seawater/sediment interface in benthic ecosystems, and (ii) the energy fluxes characterizing meiobenthic communities.

Central to this research are the following questions:
■ What is the influence of the primary production in the water column on benthic
    activity (in the bioturbation zone)?
■ What is the magnitude of the organic C flux into the bottom-layer beneath the
    bioturbation zone?
■ What is the magnitude of the organic matter recycled into the water column owing
    to benthic activity?

Regarding flux evaluations, emphasis will be laid on the activity of nematods that account 
for up to 90-95% of meiobentos densities.

The total biomass of the benthos will be evaluated by combining our own measurements 
(meiobenthos) with measurements made by teams from the BAS (macrobenthos) and from 
the NIOZ (microbenthos). In temperate areas it has been shown that a direct and positive 
relation exists between the amount of organic matter in the water column and the benthic 
biomass. The importance of benthos in the remineralization process is draw from the fact 
that meiobenthic organisms, and in particular nematods, play a central role in the bacterial 
turnover in sediments, which is of direct influence on the biogeochemistry of the sea floor.

The determination of the order of magnitude of the above interactions is one the major 
goals of this research.

PROJECT A3/12/001 - Dr J.-H. HECQ - ULg

CONTROL OF THE ANTARCTIC PELAGIC ECOSYSTEM BY SECONDARY TROPHIC 
LEVELS IN RELATION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES

The main objective of the project is to understand the mechanisms that control the 
functioning of the Antarctic planktonic ecosystem and to develop modelling tools for 
predicting the evolution of the global dynamics of the major ecosystems of the Southern 
Ocean. The more specific objective is to understand and to model how the secondary 
planktonic trophic levels interact with the lower and higher trophic levels. The model will 
be used to test the effects of different forcing phenomena on the marine ecosystem.

The main processes considered in the analyses and modelling of the marine Antarctic 
ecosystems are:
- the control of the activity and vertical distribution of plankton owing to the physical 
      structure of the water column, especially in relationship with the sea ice melting and 
      retreat;
- the control of the exportation of the primary production by zooplankton grazing;
- the switch of the organic material of phytoplanktonic origin according to the 
      composition of zooplankton communities.

The above processes will be studied on the grounds of the determination of:
- standing stocks;
- spatial and temporal variations of the biomass;
- the trophic position and role of the zooplanktonic components in the food web and 
      their turnover rate;
- the importance of the sea ice dynamics in the structural organization of the 
      zooplanktonic populations;
- the grazing, ammonium excretion, production of the fecal pellets, sedimentation 
      fluxes, nutrients recycling;
- vertical migrations of zooplankton;
- predation pressure on zooplankton by higher trophic levels such as birds and mammals.

A 1D ecological model will be developed on the grounds of the study of these fluxes and processes and will be used to test the effects of "possible stresses" acting on macroscale secondary pelagic levels in various marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean.

DYNAMICS OF THE PLANKTONIC MICROBIAL FOOD-WEB OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN 
IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES

This project aims at developing a predictive mathematical model of C, N and Si cycling through the microbial network of the upper waters of the Antarctic Ocean (that part of the Southern Ocean limited by the polar front) along the course of a seasonal cycle.

The model consists in a 1D hydrodynamical model calculating the thickness of the wind mixed layer from classical meteorological data and the dynamics of sea ice retreat and formation coupled with a biological model of the lower trophic levels composed of different modules.

This model will be used to predict more realistically the dynamics of the Antarctic planktonic microbial food-web in response to anthropogenic perturbations; at a global scale, such as those resulting from expectable long-term climatic changes; at more regional scale, such as those resulting from expectable increase of krill catches in some sub-areas.

The specific objectives of the project are the followings:
■ to establish a coupled physical-biological box model describing the dynamics of the planktonic microbial food web in the various habitats of the Antarctic Ocean;
■ to validate the model by applying it to various geographical sites where time series of physical and biological data are available;
■ to exploit this model for predicting its response to expectable long-term climatic global change and the resulting feedback it can induce;
■ to use the model at regional scale in the perspective of rational management of marine living resources.

MODELLING THE BEHAVIOUR OF OIL SPILL IN ANTARCTIC SEAS

The general goal of the project is to develop and demonstrate a deterministic computer model capable of predicting the behaviour and fate of a large oil spill in the Antarctic coastal zone in the presence of ice cover over a seasonal cycle. The evolution of the oil spill at the sea surface, in the water column and in the ice will be simulated, and the impacted targets will be displayed graphically to show the extent and magnitude of the oil impact.

SCIENCE POLICY OFFICE                                         BELGIAN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAMME ON ANTARCTICA

The model that will be developed differs from the classical, short-term oil tracking 
systems. There is a need for a longer-term assessment tool that predicts the impact of 
a large oil spill in the Antarctic under varying circumstances. Our intention is to simulate 
the evolution of the spill at the sea surface, in the water column and in the ice, over a 
seasonal cycle. After a run, the trajectories of the oil fractions and the impacted targets 
should become visible and enable one to assess the extent of the pollution.

The processes affecting oil released in a cold sea, the processes affecting Antarctic ice, 
and the oil/ice interactions will require a thorough literature survey as well as a theoretical 
approach. Three of our models will thus be reevaluated:
■ a fully deterministic oil-spill model (MU-SLICK);
■ a composite deterministic/probabilistic model (PARCEL); and
■ the SEA-ICE model developed under Phase II of the Programme.

The appropriate components will be selected, the necessary adaptations will be made and 
the models will be coupled in a single system. The possibility of interconnecting these 
predictive models with an atmospheric model being developed separately by the UCL will 
be investigated. The new oil sub-model is likely to be a 3D particle-fate oil model using the 
results of an ocean-circulation model for current advection, calculating wind drift from 
atmospheric predictions, and simulating all the important weathering processes. The ice 
model will have a thermodynamic component (freezing/melting) and a dynamic component 
(ice movement). In addition, a statistical approach will be followed to assign a position to 
the ice in each mesh of the grid.

The model will be demonstrated for the area of the Weddell Sea and several simulations 
will be run using different times and places of oil release.

ISOTOPIC AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ANTARCTIC SHELF ICE: IMPLICATIONS 
ON GLOBAL CHANGES

The project aims at studying three properties of marine ice accreted at the bottom of ice 
shelves, which provide information on the conditions prevailing at the ice shelf-ocean 
interface and on the dynamic response of ice shelves to changes in boundary conditions 
related to anthropogenic climatic changes.

Analysis of the stable isotope composition of marine ice accreted at the bottom of ice 
shelves, both in δD and δ^(18)O, will be used for reconstructing the origin of the waters that 
have subsequently frozen. Owing to the impoverishment in heavy isotopes with respect to 
sea water, which occurs during the atmospheric step of the water cycle, the isotopical 
content of melt water from continental glaciers or ice sheets exhibits highly negative 
δ-values. By contrast, melt water from sea ice shows positive δ-values since sea ice is 
slightly enriched in heavy isotopes relative to sea water. Further enrichment can occur if 
melt water from marine ice freezes and melts again. Indeed, isotope fractionation involving 
an enrichment of the ice phase in heavy isotopes is followed by melting that occurs without 
any isotopical change.

The chemical study of main components of marine ice accreted at the bottom of ice 
shelves will provide further information. Major anions and cations are not rejected during 
ice growth at the same rate and the effect is dependent on the type of marine ice formed. 
It is thus possible to reconstruct the chemical characteristics of the original water. Surface 
or subsurface sea water can be diluted either by water of continental origin or by melt 
water from marine ice, each case leading to different isotopical and chemical characteris-
tics.

Crystallographical study of the marine ice in thin section will allow to distinguish between 
congelation ice and frazil ice, among others. Congelation ice, consisting of columnar 
crystals with cell structure and brine layers, is formed by the progression of a freezing 
front in sea water. Frazil ice, consisting of small crystals, is generated within the sea 
water itself and is the consequence of a double-diffusion mechanism, heat diffusivity being 
one order of magnitude higher than salt diffusion. If its formation is favoured - as it uses 
to happen at the contact between two water layers both being at their freezing point but 
having different salinities or in ascending supercooled water - frazil ice will accrete at the 
bottom of an ice shelf. Some factors influencing isotopical or chemical fractionation during 
ice growth remain poorly known. Therefore, controlled experiments will be developed to 
supplement the data obtained in the field.

FORMATION OF THE TERRA NOVA BAY POLYNIA AND CLIMATIC IMPLICATIONS

The project aims at coupling a 3D Atmospheric Mesoscale Atmospheric Model (AMCM) able 
to simulate Antarctic katabatic winds to a polynia model, to simulate the opening of the 
Terra Nova Bay polynia. The phenomenon of the polynia formation will be assessed for its 
climatic implications.

In a first experiment, the large-scale atmospheric boundary conditions of the coupled 
polynia-AMCM will be taken from the observations of present climate. The physical 
processes playing a significant role in atmosphere-polynia interactions will be quantified. 
In a second experiment, the large-scale atmospheric forcing will be adapted from the 
results of Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) experiments made for present 
climate. This second experiment will be compared with the first and the main differences 
will be discussed. In a sensitivity test of the atmosphere-polynia interactions to a climate 
change, the large atmospheric forcing will be adapted from the results of the (AGCM) 
experiments made with a CO_(2) doubling. Again a comparison will be made between the third 
and the second experiment.

For all the experiments, the mechanical and thermodynamical fluxes computed, as well as 
the polynia extent could be used an input data of the coupled ocean-sea-ice model of the 
MUMM. This could allow the MUMM model to simulate the oceanic circulation and in 
particular the deep-water formation near the Antarctic coast. In particular, the impact of 
the thermodynamical forcing of the atmosphere circulation on the oceanic circulation will 
be compared to that of the mechanical forcing alone.

Our 3D AMCM will also be improved by nesting the fine meso-β resolution grid that is used 
up to now (that is needed for the simulation of katabatic winds on steep slopes), in a 
coarser meso-α resolution grid that is sufficient to simulate the drainage flow on the 
Antarctic Plateau. Consequently, for the representation of the same horizontal domain, the 
number of grid points will be decreased so that the computational costs of the model are 
reduced. This will also allow to represent a larger domain, to improve the katabatic wind 
simulation, and to couple the 3D version of the ASTR-AMCM to a 3D ocean-sea-ice model 
like the MUMM's ocean-sea-ice model. Before doing the nesting of the meso-β resolution 
grid in the meso-α resolution grid, sensitivity tests of the inversion winds simulation to the 
grid resolution will be performed to determine the optimum grid size for the representation 
of these winds, and to determine which part of the Antarctic slope must be represented 
with a fine resolution grid.

DYNAMICS OF THE ANTARCTIC ICE CAP AND CLIMATE CHANGES

Our main purpose is to develop a 3D model able to simulate the dynamics of the ice cap 
in response to climate and oceanic forcing.

A new modelling experiment will be carried out with inclusion of a refined grid in specific 
drainage basins and in those parts where significant gradients occur. Again the present ice 
topography and a complete glacial-interglacial cycle will be simulated.

The main purpose of our experiment is to establish the link between the more locally or 
regionally generated characteristics of the ice sheet and those that are more fundamentally 
related to the general behaviour of the ice cap in relation to climatic forcing. More 
specifically, the research goals are to understand better:

  ● the local imbalance (rising/lowering of the ice surface) as observed in certain areas 
    of drainage basins;
  ● the high velocities and deviating surface topography in and around certain ice streams 
    in East Antarctica and their significance in discharging the ice cap as compared to 
    sheet flow in other areas;
  ● the convergence and divergence around nunataks and marginal areas and their 
    relationship to the occurrence of supra-glacial moraines and/or meteorite fields;
  ● the relationship between simulated glacier variations in the mountain areas and the 
    observed sedimentation and erosion phenomena. Special attention will be given to the 
    timing of these phenomenons within the glacial cycle and to investigate the possibility 
    of a local origin (local ice divide) of the glaciations. This is important for the 
    correlation of the stratigraphic units with other mountain areas. It is obvious that, 
    to model the glacier behaviour (both past and present) within the mountain areas a 
    flow-line model is needed for which the 3-D model will provide the necessary 
    boundary conditions. Some specific problems related to flow-line modelling within the 
    mountain ranges are confluence and bifurcation, the shape factor etc... Up to now 
    most paleo-ice reconstructions have been performed by calculation of some classic 
    parabolic or Weertman type equilibrium profile.

Very special attention will be devoted to some specific aspects of the deglaciation of 
marginal mountain areas. During the deglaciation process of some of the outlet glaciers can 
- once cut off from the main ice supply from the plateau due to lowering of the ice surface 
- invert their flow pattern because of the high ablation with the mountain area (oasis 
effect). In this way they are able to disturb the sedimentation pattern and deposit 
"inverted" terminal moraine arcs.

BELGIAN CONTRIBUTION TO THE "ANTARCTIC OFFSHORE SEISMIC STRATIGRAPHY 
PROJECT" (BELANTOSTRAT)

The international ANTOSTRAT project, which was initiated in 1989 by the SCAR Group of 
Specialists on the Evolution of Cenozoic Palaeoenvironments of the Southern High 
Latitudes, aiming at the integration of the existing offshore geophysical and geological 
data bases to enhance their usefulness in coordinating future research studies and to 
eventually come to a unified Antarctic Offshore Seismostratigraphy.

Our project will contribute to theme "Sedimentary palaeoenvironment" of the Programme 
and to that purpose it will carry out marine high-resolution reflection seismic investiga-
tions of the Antarctic continental margins. This will be done with the use of RCMG's own 
seismic system. The sequence and seismostratigraphic interpretation of the seismic data 
will yield an insight in the architecture of the Antarctic continental margin sedimentary 
sequences and elicit the palaeoclimatologic signals within these sedimentary sequences.

Specific research actions in line with BELANTOSTRAT are:

Weddell Sea studies, in cooperation with AWI:

The already available joint AWI-RCMG MCS data sets of the Weddell Sea (about 7000 
km, covering a.o. Crary Fan and ODP Leg 113 sites) will be further analyzed in function 
of climatic changes. Additional seismic profiles will be got to evaluate current 
hypotheses, to refine and extend the Weddell Sea seismostratigraphic and palaeoclimat-
ological model.

Prydz Bay, in cooperation with OGS (Trieste) and Istituto di Geologia Marina (Bologna):

A joint Italian-RCMG seismic survey on outer shelf or slope environments in Prydz Bay 
(oldest drilled glacial sediments) will allow a seismostratigraphic and palaeoclimatologic 
correlation study between Prydz Bay and Weddell Sea.

Gerlache Strait, in cooperation with INACH and Universidad de Chile:

A joint Chilean-RUG seismic survey will be conducted in the Gerlache Strait, a virtually 
unexplored semi-confined rift basin along the Antarctic Peninsula (perfect sediment 
"sink", containing a complete sedimentary record of fluctuating ice sheets on the Penin-
sula).
