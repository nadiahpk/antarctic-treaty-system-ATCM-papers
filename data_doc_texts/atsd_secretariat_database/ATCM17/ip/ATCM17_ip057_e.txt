Introduction

Destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer continues at an alarming pace. In February 1992, NASA scientists warned of the growing risk of substantial ozone loss over densely-populated areas of the northern hemisphere [1]. In September the Antarctic ozone hole was reported to be the deepest ever, with 60 per cent losses already recorded [2]. Likely consequences include a worldwide increase in skin cancers and eye cataracts, adverse impacts on agriculture and marine life, and changes to the world's weather systems. The capacity of the atmosphere to produce unpleasant surprises has not diminished.

This disturbing evidence is likely to intensify public pressure for action from government and industry to eliminate use of ozone-depleting substances on a much faster timescale than currently proposed. Each country is likely to find its policies, at home and abroad, under close scrutiny.

This report documents the domestic actions already taken by most industrialised countries, revealing wide disparities between the speed at which governments act and their willingness to regulate industry.

This brief overview of the strongest existing legislation is not exhaustive, but serves to demonstrate that most uses of ozone-depleting substances would have been virtually eliminated by now if the political will had existed to carry out these measures worldwide.

Existing Regulations

Production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances is controlled by the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement due to be renegotiated in November 1992.

As yet there are no signs that governments will agree amendments and adjustments which adequately reflect the urgency of the crisis. The need to reach consensus gives foot-

dragging nations an opportunity to water down proposals. Moreover, even the most stringent proposals currently on the table are weak.

However, governments willing to act more rapidly are not constrained from doing so by the Protocol, which explicitly encourages unilateral action:

"Parties may take more stringent measures than those required by this Article" [Article 2.11]

Some governments, taking precautionary action, legislated over a decade ago. CFCs were banned in aerosols in the USA as early as 1978, in Canada in 1980 and in Norway in 1981.

Other early bans in various industry sectors have come into force more recently as concern about the ozone layer has grown. A few examples follow:

■ The use of CFCs in the foam-blowing sector was banned in Norway in July 1991. It will be banned in foam products in Austria at the beginning of 1993, and in Switzerland in October 1994.

■ Exempting dry cleaning, CFCs have been banned for use as solvents in Sweden since January 1991, in Germany since July 1992 and will be banned in Denmark by the end of 1993.

■ The use of CFCs in new refrigeration and air conditioning units has been forbidden in Norway since July 1991, and will be banned in Austria and Luxembourg from the beginning of 1994. All uses of CFCs (except for maintenance of existing refrigeration units and medical applications) are banned from the beginning of 1995 in Finland, Germany and Sweden.

■ There has been an import ban in operation for halons in New Zealand since 1990. Halon imports are also banned in Switzerland and their deployment is banned in Germany.
A methyl chloroform consumption ban will 
operate in Germany from the beginning of 
1993, and in Sweden from the beginning of 
1995. Carbon tetrachloride use has already 
been eliminated in Denmark, and will be at 
the end of 1992 in Luxembourg.

■ Several countries have already started to 
regulate the use of HCFCs. Switzerland has 
banned all uses of HCFCs, except for 
refrigeration, from 1 January 2000. Sweden 
has similarly banned HCFC use, refrigeration 
and insulation foam exempted, from the 
beginning of 1994.

■ Countries have varied in their approach to 
recovery of CFCs in existing installations. 
However, Austria, Australia and the USA, for 
example, have made the recovery of CFC 
refrigerant from refrigeration units 
mandatory, and recycling of CFCs from the 
foam is taking place in the Netherlands, 
Switzerland and Luxembourg amongst others. 
Venting of CFCs from refrigeration 
equipment is now illegal in New Zealand and 
the USA.

The Benefits of Regulation

Setting early phaseout dates for particular uses 
of CFCs and other chemicals plays an 
important role in creating incentives for 
industry to innovate. This then stimulates 
research into substitutes, and gives industry an 
international market lead in technologies 
which do use ozone depleters. Regulation 
ensures that companies make the switch to 
ozone-friendly alternatives, even when these 
may be more expensive.

The benefits of such unilateral measures 
spread well beyond a country’s own borders. 
Elimination of a particular ozone-depleting 
chemical in one country undermines the 
protestations of companies operating abroad 
that alternatives do not exist.

Indeed, had each industrialised country 
adopted the most stringent measures from 
each piece of legislation already in place, an
almost complete ban of CFCs, halons and 
carbon tetrachloride consumption would now 
be in place. Methyl chloroform use would be 
forbidden at the end of the year. The only 
exemptions would be for limited CFC use for 
maintenance of existing refrigeration units 
and in medical aerosols.

By contrast, where governments have 
preferred to rely on the encouragement of 
industry and on consumer pressure - the 
“voluntary approach” - the reductions 
achieved have been largely from aerosols and 
food packaging, with much smaller cuts in 
industry sectors which are less amenable to 
public control.

Conclusion

National and international regulations on 
ozone-depleting chemicals need to be 
urgently reviewed in the light of recent 
scientific evidence.

The best practice of each country should 
reasonably form the baseline which all 
industrialised countries can and must attain - a 
minimum starting point for participating in 
international negotiations with good faith.

Moreover, there is considerable scope for 
improving on the measures in national plans 
outlined here. Indeed, given the published 
intent of many CFC manufacturers to close 
down their production plants on a similar 
timescale, these measures will do little to 
force the pace of industry.

There is every reason for confidence that 
earlier phaseout dates set by further regulation 
will be met by industry. With better CFC and 
halon recovery, production of these chemicals 
can and should cease immediately. There is 
little doubt that this is vital if the already 
unacceptable risk of further damage to the 
ozone layer is to be minimised.

NETHERLANDS

Note:

The Netherlands programme was intended to be largely voluntary in nature. At the time of going to press, legislation is still in draft form - some changes may take place before coming into force but information about the changes is not yet available. The relative success and failure in different sectors of the voluntary initiative is reflected in the patchy nature of the sector regulations.

A. Phaseout dates for ozone-depleting substances

CFCs

aim:
almost complete elimination of CFC use by beginning 1995 [1]

Halons

aim:
elimination of halon use 1995 [1]

(See sector bans which will eliminate much halon use when decree passed)

Methyl chloroform

no regulations

Carbon tetrachloride

no regulations

air conditioning industry, the industrial and 
commercial air conditioning and refrigeration 
industry will have approved.

                                   no statutory restrictions; informally the Fire 
                                   Protection Industry Association is registering

Note:

11th February 1992: President Bush announced the acccleration of the phaseout of ozone-depleting substances. Production of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform will be eliminated by 31st December 1995; the following targets will be affected by any changes made. President Bush also called on US producers to reduce production to 50 per cent of 1986 levels by the end of 1992.

A. Phaseout dates for ozone-depleting substances

(figures refer to per cent production/ consumption of baseline year. Dates refer to 1st January of that year.)

1993 - 75 per cent
1994 - 65 per cent
1995 - 50 per cent
1996 - 40 per cent
1997 - 15 per cent
2000 - complete phaseout

HCFCs

1st January 2015: production permitted only for use in refrigeration equipment manufactured before 2020 [1]

1st January 2030: complete phaseout of HCFC production [1]

B. Sector by sector measures

Class I = CFCs, halons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride

Class II = HCFCs

Note:

Nothing in the Clean Air Act specifically restricts the solvent or refrigeration sectors, however, the Safe Alternatives provision and the "lowest achievable emission" goal give the Environment Protection Act broad authority to ban any use. Some sectors, however, are affected by the non-essential use bans in the Act [2]
Aerosols

1978: non-essential uses of CFCs as aerosol propellants banned

15th November 1992: ban on remaining non-essential aerosol products containing class I substances, including CFC-propelled plastic party streamers, noise horns and cleaning fluids for non-commercial and photographic equipment [1]

1st January 1994: ban on HCFCs in aerosols except where necessary for worker safety, low flammability or for exempted medical uses [1]

Labelling scheme

containers containing class I or class II substances and products containing class I substances must be labelled by 15th May 1993 [1]

Products manufactured with class I substances must be labelled unless it is determined that no alternative exists that does not use a class I substance, does not reduce the risk to health and environment, and is not currently or potentially available [1]

Products containing or manufactured with class II substances do not have to be labelled until 1st January 2015 unless the EPA administrator determines that there are suitable substitutes that do not rely on Class II substances, reduce the risk to health and the environment, and are currently or potentially available. If such a substitute is determined to exist after a petition process, then it must be labelled within one year of receipt of the petition [1]

Foams

1st January 1994: ban on HCFCs in non-insulating foams or foams providing for motor vehicle safety [1]

Environment Protection Agency has the authority, and is proposing, to ban CFCs in flexible and packaging foams in 1992 (under non-essential product ban) [2]

Solvents

15th November 1992: ban on CFC-containing cleaning fluids for non-commercial electronic and photographic equipment [1]

There are specific exceptions in law for the use of methyl chloroform in non-destructive testing for metal fatigue in aircraft engines and medical devices [1]

1st January 1992: recycling class I and class II refrigerants at car air conditioning workshops required by this date [1]

1st July 1992: recycling of class I substances used in refrigeration during service, repair and disposal required by this date, as is the recycling of all class I and class II substances [1]

Recycling of all Class I substances and HCFCs, with the goal of achieving the "lowest achievable level" of emissions is required by 1994 [1]

Recovery of CFCs from foam in fridges

none
Maintenance and leakage
                        
refrigeration or mandatory training for refrigeration 
engineers

1st January 1992: certification of equipment 
and personnel for servicing of motor vehicle 
air conditioners [1]

Controls on leakage

1st July 1992: ban on venting any CFC or 
HCFC refrigerant [1]

1995: Ban on venting any substitute 
refrigerant (including HFCs) - unless it does 
not pose a threat to the ozone layer [1]

Halons/Fire Extinguishing

no regulations, but the EPA has the authority 
to ban halon uses under the non-essential 
product ban provision [1] The Agency has 
sought comments on whether it should ban 
portable fire extinguishers for domestic use in 
1992 [2]

Exemptions exist in the Clean Air Act for the 
use of halons in aviation safety, at sites 
necessary to protect national security, 
explosion suppression [1]
