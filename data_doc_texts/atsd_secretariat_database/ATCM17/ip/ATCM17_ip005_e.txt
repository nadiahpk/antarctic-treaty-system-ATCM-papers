ABSTRACT. Approximately 39 000 tourists have visited Antarctica since 1957; numbers per year are provided. A brief
history of sea and airbone tourism in Antarctica reveals past and current trends. The formation of the International
Association of Antarctica Tour Operators and its role in the self-regulated tourism industry in Antarctica are considered,
together with the implications of recently-promulgated Antarctic Treaty Recommendation XVI-13. The number of
tourists visiting Antarctica is shown to exceed the combined number of scientists and support personnel from all National
Antarctic Programs. It is concluded that the ATS provides a suitable framework within which to develop measures to
protect Antarctica from tourist activity. However, regulations developed must be based on hard data on the size and
impact of the industry to be effectively implemented.

                                    Introduction

Antarctica emerged as a tourist destination only 35 years                        Development of the industry
ago. Since then approximately 39 000 tourists are esti-
mated to have landed. Data for 28 of these years indicates                           Shipborne tourism
that Antarctic tourism is experiencing a substantial period
of growth. Of the total landed, more than 40% have                                    Commercial cruiseslines currently bring the greatest number

(Table 1, Fig. 1). The total number of tourists who have                              000 (Table 2, Fig. 2): from 1980/81 onwards these have

Two ships which operated from the Australian/New Zea-
land side were Frontier Spirit (Salen Lindblad Cruising)
and World Discoverer (Society Expeditions) (Table 3).

Reich (1980) summarized Antarctic tourism up to the
late 1970s. Tours to Antarctica began in 1957/58 when
Argentina and Chile ran four cruises involving over 500
tourists to the South Shetland Islands (Headland 1989:
379, 385). Lindblad Travel of New York offered the first
US-operated cruise aboard the chartered Argentine Navy
vessel Lapataia in January-February 1966 (ibid.: 432).
During the 1970s Lindblad Travel dominated the Antarc-
tic cruise market, to be overtaken during the 1980s by
Society Expeditions (Quigg 1983: 99; Enzenbacher 1991:
20-3). Argentina ran regular cruises aboard Bahia Paraiso,

a naval resupply vessel, until it sank off the coast of Anvers
Island in January 1989. Currently two US companies,
Society Expeditions and Travel Dynamics, are dominant,
each offering several cruises of two to three weeks per
season.

Numbers of tourists on Antarctic-bound vessels vary
widely. Such ships as Society Explorer and World Discov-
erer carry from 98 to 139 passengers (Society Expeditions
1991). A Spanish-operated cruise aboard Cabo San Roque
in January 1973 carried about 900 tourists (Headland
1989: 478). Argentine cruises conducted between 1958
until 1976, when fuel costs deterred further tourist opera-
tions, '... could generally accommodate 400-800 passen-
gers, and one cruise is believed to have carried 1,250
persons' (Quigg 1983: 99). Ocean Princess, operated by
Ocean Cruise Lines and first used in Antarctica during
1990/91, can carry 480 passengers but takes fewer on
Antarctic cruises (USAP 1990: 124; Antarctic Century
1991: 6). Private yachts have been manned solo (Ice Bird,
1972) or may carry up to 20 fare-paying passengers (UAP,
1990).

Airborne tourism

Far fewer tourists travel to Antarctica by air than by sea
(Table 1): airborne tours that land in Antarctica have
increased the total number of tourists only slightly. The

more than 11 000 passengers (Reich 1980:210-11). After 
the crash of an Air New Zealand DC-10 on Mt. Erebus 
(Ross Island) on 28 November 1979, with no survivors 
among the 257 passengers and crew, tourist overflights 
became less popular. The last Qantas flight over Antarc-
tica was made on 16 February 1980 (Headland 1989: 526).

During the 1983/84 season the Chileans began annual 
tourist flights from Punta Arenas to Teniente Rodolfo 
Marsh Station on King George Island, in C-130 aircraft 
which typically transport 40 tourists per trip (Chile 1988: 
8). Tourists are accommodated in the first Antarctic tourist 
'hotel', Estrella Polar.

In 1970 Max Conrad crossed the continent solo in a 
small ski-equipped aircraft. Since 1984 Adventure Net-
work International (ANI), based in Vancouver, BC, has 
organized expeditions using ski-equipped aircraft, ships 
and skis to many destinations in the Antarctic. Twin Otters 
and DC-4s used by Adventure Network carry between 10-
25 passengers. Though most flights occur during a short 
summer season from November to March, ANI achieved 
a record nine-months flying season July to April during 
1989/90 operations (Swithinbank 1990: 316).

The current industry

During the 1990/91 season at least 4842 tourists visited 
Antarctica. This represents the largest tourist presence 
recorded: tourists now outnumber national scientific and 
logistic personnel (estimated at 4000) by a significant 
margin. The previous record of 3644 tourists occurred 
during the 1974/75 season (Reich 1980: 208). American-
based tour operators currently bring the greatest number of 
tourists to Antarctica. Among them are: Condor Expedi-
tions International (New York), Forum Travel Interna-
tional (California), Mountain Travel (California), Ocean 
Cruise Lines (Florida), Salén Lindblad Cruising (Con-
necticut) which also acts as sales agent for Quark Expedi-
tions, Society Expeditions (Washington), TRAVCOA 
(California) and Travel Dynamics (New York). Zegrahm 
Expeditions (Washington) and the International Cruise 
Center of Mineola, New York are the latest entrants into 
the market, with cruises planned for the 1991/92 season.

Some operators offer a combination cruise/flight visit 
to Antarctica, in which tourists have the option to fly one 
way, reducing both costs and the amount of time needed 
for an Antarctic holiday, and avoiding a second crossing of 
the Drake Passage by ship. Thus in 1981/82 510 passen-
gers flew one or both ways to or from Presidente Frei 
Station as part of a tour package offered by Transoceánica, 
Santiago de Chile, which chartered World Discoverer from 
31 December 1981 until 20 January 1982. These shorter 
visits allow tour operators to target a larger tourist market. 
Overall, tourists currently have a wide-ranging choice of 
land or sea-based services if Antarctica is their travel 
destination.

The most frequently visited area of Antarctica is Ant-
arctic Peninsula. This popularity is attributable to: (1) the 
proximity and abundance of South American ports; (2) a 
milder summer climate than elsewhere in Antarctica; (3) 
diverse and abundant wildlife offering photo opportuni-
ties; (4) relative freedom from pack ice for landings 
compared with other parts of the Antarctic coast; and (5) 
the largest concentration of Antarctic research stations, 
visits to which are included in most tours. The US National 
Science Foundation compiled statistics on numbers of 
tourists landed by US tour operators at sites in the Antarc-
tic Peninsula area during the 1989/90 and 1990/91 austral 
summer seasons. The site visited by the greatest number 
of tourists during both seasons was Whalers Bay, Decep-
tion Island. During the 1989/90 season 1682 tourists 
visited the site while 1496 visited during the 1990/91 
season (Antarctic Treaty 1991). At present Americans

comprise the largest percentage of Antarctic tourists (Beck 
1990: 346), which may in part be attributed to the market-
ing strategies of existing Antarctic tour operators as well as 
other factors including amount of disposable income, 
opportunity, and size of the US population.

more than 11 000 passengers (Reich 1980:210-11). After 
the crash of an Air New Zealand DC-10 on Mt. Erebus 
(Ross Island) on 28 November 1979, with no survivors 
among the 257 passengers and crew, tourist overflights 
became less popular. The last Qantas flight over Antarc-
tica was made on 16 February 1980 (Headland 1989: 526).

During the 1983/84 season the Chileans began annual 
tourist flights from Punta Arenas to Teniente Rodolfo 
Marsh Station on King George Island, in C-130 aircraft 
which typically transport 40 tourists per trip (Chile 1988: 
8). Tourists are accommodated in the first Antarctic tourist 
'hotel', Estrella Polar.

In 1970 Max Conrad crossed the continent solo in a 
small ski-equipped aircraft. Since 1984 Adventure Net-
work International (ANI), based in Vancouver, BC, has 
organized expeditons using ski-equipped aircraft, ships 
and skis to many destinations in the Antarctic. Twin Otters 
and DC-4s used by Adventure Network carry between 10-
25 passengers. Though most flights occur during a short 
summer season from November to March, ANI achieved 
a record nine-months flying season July to April during 
1989/90 operations (Swithinbank 1990: 316).

The current industry

During the 1990/91 season at least 4842 tourists visited 
Antarctica. This represents the largest tourist presence 
recorded: tourists now outnumber national scientific and 
logistic personnel (estimated at 4000) by a significant 
margin. The previous record of 3644 tourists occurred 
during the 1974/75 season (Reich 1980: 208). American-
based tour operators currently bring the greatest number of 
tourists to Antarctica. Among them are: Condor Expedi-
tions International (New York), Forum Travel Interna-
tional (California), Mountain Travel (California), Ocean 
Cruise Lines (Florida), Salén Lindblad Cruising (Con-
necticut) which also acts as sales agent for Quark Expedi-
tions, Society Expeditions (Washington), TRAVCOA 
(California) and Travel Dynamics (New York). Zegrahm 
Expeditions (Washington) and the International Cruise 
Center of Mineola, New York are the latest entrants into 
the market, with cruises planned for the 1991/92 season.

Some operators offer a combination cruise/flight visit 
to Antarctica, in which tourists have the option to fly one 
way, reducing both costs and the amount of time needed 
for an Antarctic holiday, and avoiding a second crossing of 
the Drake Passage by ship. Thus in 1981/82 510 passen-
gers flew one or both ways to or from Presidente Frei 
Station as part of a tour package offered by Transoceánica, 
Santiago de Chile, which chartered World Discoverer from 
31 December 1981 until 20 January 1982. These shorter 
visits allow tour operators to target a larger tourist market. 
Overall, tourists currently have a wide-ranging tourist choice of 
land or sea-based services if Antarctica is their travel 
destination.

The most frequently visited area of Antarctica is Ant-
arctic Peninsula. This popularity is attributable to: (1) the 
proximity and abundance of South American ports; (2) a 
milder summer climate than elsewhere in Antarctica; (3) 
diverse and abundant wildlife offering photo opportuni-
ties; (4) relative freedom from pack ice for landings 
compared with other parts of the Antarctic coast; and (5) 
the largest concentration of Antarctic research stations, 
visits to which are included in most tours. The US National 
Science Foundation compiled statistics on numbers of 
tourists landed by US tour operators at sites in the Antarc-
tic Peninsula area during the 1989/90 and 1990/91 austral 
summer seasons. The site visited by the greatest number 
of tourists during both seasons was Whalers Bay, Decep-
tion Island. During the 1989/90 season 1682 tourists 
visited the site while 1496 visited during the 1990/91 
season (Antarctic Treaty 1991). At present Americans

cut), Travel Dynamics (New York, New York), Adventure
Network International (Vancouver, British Columbia),
Mountain Travel/Sobek (El Cerrito, California) and
Zegrahm Expeditions (Seattle, Washington). IAATO
members have carried a substantial majority of tourists to
Antarctica over the past 25 years and have endorsed a set
of guidelines for aircraft and land-based private-sector
travel to and within the Antarctic interior.

Members of IAATO have pledged: (1) to be knowl-
edgeable of and abide by the Antarctic Conservation Act
of 1978 (U.S. Public Law 95-541); (2) not to enter areas
designated as sites of special scientific interest or that need
special protection; (3) to operate only with qualified expe-
dition staff of which at least 75% must have previous
Antarctic experience; (4) to hire only Zodiac drivers with
experience in polar regions; (5) to educate passengers and
crew and enforce the members' self-imposed Antarctica
Visitor Guidelines; (6) to assign one qualified naturalist
staff member to accompany and supervise each group of
20-25 passengers (maximum) ashore; (7) to cooperate
with science stations and not disturb sites of scientific
research; (8) to limit the number of passengers ashore; and
(9) to follow the international MARPOL treaty guidelines
regarding marine pollution (IAATO 1991).

Antarctic Treaty recommendations
At Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XV, Treaty
Parties agreed that a comprehensive review of tourism was
required. The following meeting, ATCM XVI which
convened in Bonn 7-18 October 1991 (see Scar Bulletin
104 in this issue of Polar Record) noted that the Protocol
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and
its annexes apply to tourist activities in Antarctica and
reiterated treaty members concerns about the possible
effect increased tourist activity may have on Antarctica.
Recommendation XVI-13 calls for an informal meet-
ing of Treaty Parties to be convened in Venice (the venue
of ATCM XVII) on 9 November 1992, 'with a view to
making proposals to the XVIIth Consultative Meeting on
the question of a comprehensive regulation of tourist and
non-governmental activities in Antarctica in accordance
with the Protocol and taking into account the proposals
made at the present XVIth Consultative Meeting, includ-
ing proposals for a future Annex to the Protocol on Envi-
ronmental Protection'. Treaty Parties agreed to invite
IAATO to attend the 1992 meeting as an observer, along
with representatives of the WTO (World Tourism Organi-
zation), IUCN (International Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources), IMO (International Mari-
time Organization), ASOC (Antarctic and Southern Ocean
Coalition), PATA (Pacific Asia Travel Association), SCAR
(Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) and
COMNAP (Council of Managers of National Antarctic
Programs). Observers and experts from SCAR, COMNAP,
ASOC, IAATO, IMO, IUCN and WTO were present at
ATCM XVI in Bonn.

Tourism and the environment
Future levels of Antarctic tourism are difficult to predict,
but rising current levels prompt the question of whether
Antarctica's environment is adequately protected against
existing and possible future levels of tourist activity.
Members of IAATO have the opportunity to exert appro-
priate pressures and influence on most tourists travelling to
Antarctica, in keeping with the established guidelines for
Antarctic visitors. The comprehensive review of Antarctic
tourism proposed by treaty members provides a starting
point for discussion of existing tourism policy in view of
current levels and forms of tourist activity.

In addition to tourist numbers, other factors important
22     ENZENBACHER

in assessing tourist activity are: 1) mode of transportation 
to Antarctica; 2) length and type of stay; 3) behavior of 
tourists in relation to numbers; and 4) tour operator poli-
cies. More consistent reporting procedures would provide 
more reliable statistics on the size of the Antarctic tourism 
industry. Data collected for this article were both fragmen-
tary and widely dispersed.

To date, no comprehensive tourism impact assessment 
has been undertaken in Antarctica which enables policy 
makers to identify specific problems requiring further 
attention. At present Antarctic policy makers and tour 
operators are regulating a commercial industry whose 
effects are not yet fully understood. A better understand-
ing of tourism impacts would aid the formulation of a 
comprehensive tourism policy agreed within the Antarctic 
Treaty System.

One initiative to monitor and assess the effects of 
tourist activity in Antarctica is Project Antarctic Conser-
vation, an international initiative based at the Scott Polar 
Research Institute, Cambridge. Supported by British 
Antarctic Survey, and involving Chilean and Argentine 
collaboration, this project has the logistic support and 
cooperation of a number of tour operators. A pilot project, 
made possible by a grant to Dr Bernard Stonehouse from 
the World Wide Fund for Nature, is scheduled to start on 
the South Shetland Islands in December 1991. Research-
ers plan to map and catalogue vegetation, breeding and 
nesting sites of wildlife and sites of historical or archae-
ological interest at a site frequently visited by tour parties, 
to monitor tour party activities, with the aim of measuring 
impacts and developing management guidelines, and to 
survey tourists' expectations and responses. Data from 
this study will be useful to policy makers attempting to 
understand the impacts generated by the commercial tour-
ist industry in Antarctica.

Conclusions

Tourist activity presents special challenges to Antarctic 
Treaty Parties, especially since tourists are beginning to 
outnumber scientists and support staff in Antarctica. The 
Antarctic Treaty System provides a forum in which to 
develop strategies to protect Antarctica from the effects of 
tourist activity. The recent Environmental Protocol marks 
an important step in the regulation of human activity in 
Antarctica. However, future measures covering tourist 
activities need to be based on sound information, including 
field data on impacts. Revised approaches to tourism data 
collection and reporting procedures are also required.

The major Antarctic tour operators, in forming IAATO, 
have consolidated their efforts to self-regulate the Antarc-    tic tourism industry. Treaty Parties have recognized the 
need for extensive discussion of tourism issues in the 
ATCM forum. Cooperation between tour operators and 
the Antarctic Treaty parties will remain integral to the 
development of measures aimed at regulating the Antarc-
tic tourism industry. How effective the System will 
ultimately be in responding to tourism issues remains to be 
seen.

Monitoring shipborne visitors in Antarctica: 
a preliminary field study

Received May 1992

ABSTRACT. During every austral summer since the International Geophysical Year 1957-58 several thousand 
scientists and support staff have worked in Antarctica. A more recent development is the annual advent of 4000-5000 
tourists, who now probably outnumber expedition members in the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty System. Most 
tourists come by ship, visiting coastal areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Orkney and South Shetland islands 
that are readily accessible beween November and March: smaller numbers visit the Ross Dependency and Adélie Land 
sectors. This article reviews Antarctic Treaty and International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural 
Resources (IUCN) attitudes to tourism, and outlines a preliminary study of shipborne tourism between late December 
1991 and March 1992 on Half Moon Island, South Shetland Islands. Within one month (January) a survey team from 
the Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, recorded 14 visits by six tour ships, bringing more than 2000 
tourists. In addition, attitudes and expectations of visitors were studied on five ships. Arising from this study, a 
programme of visitor monitoring is planned as a joint project between British, Chilean, and Argentine scientific 
institutions during the next five years. Objectives are to find ways of minimizing both short-term and long-term impacts 
of tourists and other visitors on breeding birds and other ecological communities, and to provide a factual basis for 
regulation under the Antarctic Treaty System.

Introduction

Since man's first advances into Antarctica in the early 
twentieth century, increasing numbers of visitors of sev-
eral categories have made use of the continent. Hitherto, 
and especially since the International Geophysical Year 
1957-58, scientists and their support staff have been the 
most numerous, numbering a few hundred in winter and up 
to 5000 in summer. A more recent development has been 
increasing numbers of tourists in Antarctica.

A tourist may be defined as 'one who travels for 
pleasure or culture, visiting a number of places for their 
objects of interest, scenery or the like' (Shorter Oxford 
English Dictionary 1983). Arctic tourism was well estab-
lished by the end of the nineteenth century, and it was not 
unusual for Arctic expedition ships of the nineteenth and 
early twentieth centuries to carry passengers whose fares 
helped to defray expenses. There was no Antarctic tourism 
during this period

not sponsored by the Consultative Parties could have 
'harmful effects on scientific programmes, on the Antarc-
tic environment, particularly in Specially Protected Areas, 
and on historic monuments.'

Recommendation VII-4 of the seventh meeting (1972) 
more generously suggested the future designation of 'an 
adequate number of areas of interest to which tourists 
could be encouraged to go....' However, Recommenda-
tion VIII-9 of the eighth meeting (1974), while acknowl-
edging that 'tourism is a natural development in this Area', 
specified only 'the necessity to restrict the number of 
places where large numbers of tourists may land so that the 
ecological effects may be monitored.' Provision was 
made under this recommendation for 'Areas of Special 
Tourist Interest,' though none was actually designated. 
Despite further discussions at subsequent meetings, no 
ASTI has ever been agreed.

The suggestion that landings might be restricted to 
facilitate monitoring was never taken up. Restrictions 
were, however, imposed on tourism by the establishment 
of more scientific reserves (Sites of Special Scientific 
Interest and Specially Protected Areas), which effectively 
excluded tourists from interesting and instructive areas of 
Antarctica. Though several designations covered areas 
that were regularly visited by tourist parties, neither tour-
ists nor tour operators were invited to express views on 
their selection or provided with mechanisms of appeal 
against them.

Recent developments within the Antarctic Treaty Sys-
tem indicate a more even-handed approach to tourism. 
Under the Protocol on Environmental Protection (Antarc-
tic Treaty 1991) the Treaty Parties intend to deal with 
tourism not as a special issue, but as one of several 
environmental challenges. The Protocol commits signa-
tory parties to 'the comprehensive protection of the Ant-
arctic environment and dependent and associated ecosys-
tems' and provides both for activities in the Treaty area to 
be 'planned and conducted so as to limit adverse impacts 
on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associ-
ated ecosystems' and for 'regular and effective monitoring 
to allow assessment of the impacts of ongoing activities....' 
Scientific research and tourism are equally specified as 
subject to the provisions of the Protocol.

A similar even-handedness is shown by the Interna-
tional Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural 
Resources (IUCN), whose 'Strategy for Antarctic Conser-
vation' (IUCN 1991: 55) lists both positive and negative 
consequences of tourism in Antarctica:

Tourism offers both benefits and threats to Antarctic 
conservation. On the one hand, all who experience its 
magnificent scenery and wildlife gain a greatly en-
hanced appreciation of Antarctica's global impor-
tance and of the requirements for its conservation. 
Such visits also bring fulfilment to those seeking 
personal challenge and wilderness adventure. Moreo-
ver, scientific activities may also benefit, since tourist 
visits can provide a useful link with the outside world 
and strengthen political support for Antarctic science,
and small, independent expeditions to remote areas 
often make valuable scientific observations. On the 
other hand, there is the potential for undesirable 
impacts such as disturbance at wildlife breeding sites, 
trampling of vegetation, disruption of routines at 
stations and of scientific programmes, and the envi-
ronmental hazards of accidents, which may require 
time-consuming and costly search-and-rescue and 
environmental cleanup operations.

The report points out that there could in future be added 
pressure for facilities such as wharves, airstrips, and ho-
tels, the construction of which would incur environmental 
disturbance on a greater scale than has been caused by 
tourism hitherto. Arguably, this is a scale that has been 
accepted almost without question for scientific and logis-
tic centres. It would be a large tourist facility indeed that 
matched the current scale of installations and activities at 
McMurdo, Rothera, or Mawson stations. The report 
concludes, however, that:

Experience to date suggests that, in general, tourist 
operations have been conducted in a responsible man-
ner and undesirable impacts have not been severe, 
especially compared to environmental impacts of 
scientific and associated logistical activity.

IUCN's recommendations (Ibid.: 70) covering research 
to strengthen conservation measures for managing Ant-
arctic tourism are discussed below.

Shipborne tourism

Tours ships have visited Antarctica every year from 1966 
onward (Reich 1980, 1982; Enzenbacher 1992), carrying 
a total of more than 37,000 passengers with an almost 
exemplary safety record. In a period during which several 
expedition and survey ships have been damaged or lost, 
some with considerable environmental impact, no ship 
dedicated to tourism has been lost, suffered serious dam-
age, or made a

Antarctic tourism was marred by the crash on 28 Novem-
ber 1979 of an Air New Zealand DC10 aircraft into Mount
Erebus, with the loss of 257 passengers and crew (Auburn
1983). This disaster ended a form of tourism — overflying
Antarctica on scenic flights without landing — that was
growing in popularity and appeared to offer considerable
potential for expansion with minimal environmental ef-
fects.

Antarctic shipboard tourism has grown slowly and
irregularly. The number of passengers rose to a peak of
more than 3500 in 1974/75, declined to fewer than 1000 in
1980, then rose again during the 1980s to exceed 4000.
During the southern summer 1990/91, more than 4600
tourists are estimated to have visited Antarctica
(Enzenbacher 1992: 18, 19), and during 1991/92 over
6000 (D. Enzenbacher, personal communication, 1992).
Shipborne tourists in Antarctica are currently likely to
outnumber scientists, support staff and all other categories
of summer visitors. A very small number of tourists
overwinter, mostly in private yachts.

Most cruise ships sail from ports in southern Tierra del
Fuego to visit the maritime Antarctic region, including the
Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland and South
Orkney islands. A few cruises each year include South
Georgia in their itinerary: US sources indicate that some
2000 tourists visit annually (P. Davis, personal communi-
cation, 1992). Other cruises, often involving the same
ships, leave southern ports in New Zealand and Tasmania
to visit the McMurdo Sound, Cape Adare, and Common-
wealth Bay sectors, usually including Macquarie Island
and some of the southern islands of New Zealand in their
itineraries.

Many tour ships that visit Antarctica are ice-strength-
ened, and vary in passenger capacity from a reported 1250
to fewer than 50. Those favoured by some of the most
successful and long-standing operators carry 100-150
passengers in luxurious accommodation with haute cui-
sine standards of catering. The recent advent of larger
ships carrying up to 400 passengers, and of smaller ships
carrying fewer than 60, has broadened the range of cruises
available. This factor, together with the cheaper cruises
offered on some large ships, are among several indications
that the market for cruises will continue to expand and that
the industry will grow rather than decline during the next
few years.

Patterns of passenger management adopted by cruise
operators on board and ashore, which Reich (1982) de-
scribed from personal experience during the 1980/81 sea-
son, appear to have changed little. The concept that cruises
are educational ‘expeditions,’ originating from Lars-Eric
Lindblad, who inaugurated the earliest Antarctic tours,
has provided a norm that most cruise operators continue to
follow. Cruise directors seek to provide educationally
based experiences that, in the words of one promotional
brochure, support a ‘theme of conservation and preserva-
tion’ and send their clients home ‘with everlasting memo-
ries of the wonders of nature and an increased awareness

of our responsibility towards preserving it’ (Society Expe-
ditions, quoted by Reich ibid.).

The recently formed International Association of Ant-
arctic Tour Operators (IAATO), which includes several of
the most experienced shipborne operators, clearly sees for
its members an important educational role, both in increas-
ing public awareness of Antarctic issues and in rectifying
misapprehensions about the nature of Antarctic tourism.
An inaugural press release (IAATO 1991), included the
view that ‘Recent statements in the press indicate that
politicians and other spokesmen are poorly informed and
hold grave misconceptions in regard to the way tourism is
conducted in Antarctica.’ Representing its members as
having ‘worked closely together with scientists, environ-
mental groups and the National Science Foundation in
educating and informing the visitors they bring to Antarc-
tica,’ the statement continues:

IAATO’s members strongly believe that environ-
mentally conscious tourism to Antarctica will benefit
the continent’s future preservation. IAATO’s mem-
bers have carried the large majority of all visitors who
have traveled to Antarctica over the last 25 years.
Each visitor they have taken to Antarctica returns a
well informed Antarctic Ambassador. Environmen-
tally-sound and educational travel to Antarctica, there-
fore, will continue to be an essential element in
creating public support for protective legislation and
in guarding against future attempts to exploit the
mineral wealth and the rich wildlife

(1991: 70) quoted above, one of a very few published attempts to address the problem, recommends that controls over Antarctic tourism be augmented by (i) a comprehensive review of tourism issues (including requirements of prior notification and approval of expeditions and tours, codes of conduct, safety standards, insurance, liability guidelines, environmental impact assessments, inspection and reporting procedures, information and education materials); (ii) promoting interactions between governments, managers of National Antarctic Programmes, scientists, and tour operators with the intention of developing tour management guidelines; (iii) proactive planning for Areas of Special Tourist Interest followed by careful monitoring of subsequent impacts; and (iv) controlling the choice of tourist destinations.

Responding to this challenge, the Polar Ecology and Management Group of the Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, has initiated research into management of Antarctic tourism in the Peninsula sector of Antarctica. This programme arises in conjunction with other studies of Antarctic management issues, including research on the impaired environment of King George Island (Harris 1991a, 1991b), the need for a management policy for South Georgia, and the management of national Antarctic science programmes (Dey 1991). Based on an accord under negotiation between British, Argentine, and Chilean scientific institutions, the tourism project currently involves, and will continue to welcome, research workers from other Antarctic Treaty nations.

Objectives include examination of (i) how parties of tourists are managed afloat and ashore (ii) impacts they may make on plant and animal communities and other facets of environment, and (iii) what management procedures are most likely to be effective in minimizing undesirable impacts between tourists and the environment. Many of our findings are likely to be relevant to possible impacts of scientists and support staff on the environment: hence our concern to monitor impacts, not only from tourists, but from all human visitors.

To initiate the research, a team consisting of Bernard Stonehouse (UK), Anita Dey (India), and Debra Enzenbacher (USA) made a preliminary study of tourist visits and movements on the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula from late-December 1991 to mid-February 1992. Enzenbacher continued working on tours ships until mid-March 1992; Stonehouse and Dey returned through Chile and Argentina for discussions on the future of the programme with the directors of Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) and Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH).

On the South Shetland Islands the team worked with J.M. Acero, M. Favero and other IAA scientists and support staff at Station Teniente Camára, Half Moon Island (Isla Media Luna). Two Chilean scientists from INACH under the direction of J. Valencia were scheduled to join the team but were unable to do so. Funding for the SPRI group was provided by the World Wide Fund for Nature.

The preliminary study had the following purposes:
1. to monitor visitor activities on the island;
2. to begin categorizing sites in the maritime Antarctic that are currently attractive to visitors, and assessing their suitability for continuing visits;
3. to draw up specifications for a research and visitors' information centre in the South Shetland Islands, to assess the suitability of Half Moon Island for this purpose, and to consider possible alternative sites;
4. to discuss ways and means of implementing a centre as an international operation involving British, Argentine, and Chilean cooperation;
5. to investigate non-intrusive ways of studying human/animal impacts, especially relationships between tourists and bird colonies;
6. to survey Half Moon Island botanically and for sites of archaeological interest.

Preliminary results

During the team's stay of just over one month on Half Moon Island, Dey and Enzenbacher registered 14 visits from six cruise ships, with a total of more than 2000 passengers. At each visit details of the ship, operators, parties aboard, number of zodiacs used, length of stay, numbers of passengers ashore, and other details were recorded. Video recordings were made of the behaviour of visitors and their interactions with penguins and other fauna and flora.

Preliminary indications were that tour parties were well-disciplined and organized, and that impacts with animals and plant communities were slight. However, the potential for harm by ill-disciplined groups is great, and possible long-term effects on ecosystems must be taken into account in assessing total impact.

Between visits, video recordings of penguin behaviour were made, with and without people present, as a basis for future behavioural studies. An experimental temperature-recording egg was developed for future incubation studies, and use of a radiometer for measuring surface temperatures of placid and mildly-stressed animals was investigated.

Acero developed a technique, based on 10-metre quadrants, for a survey of the island's vegetation communities. The technique will be useful in making rapid surveys of other sites that may be subject to tourist pressures.

Simultaneously, Enzenbacher made a survey of visitor's attitudes at the start and end of their voyages, based on

barrels bearing the stamp of a Belgian manufacturer. In 
late January, when much of the winter snow had disap-
peared, we examined the island for further sites of archaeo-
logical interest, but found none.

Acero, Favero, and Stonehouse drew up criteria for 
categorizing sites that are currently visited by tours ships, 
and devized a 15-point plan for assessing their qualities 
and suitability (Table 1).

Table 1. 15-point plan for assessing the qualities of 
tourist landing sites.

A. Approaches and access
   1. Approaches. Are there clear, safe, and well-defined 
       approaches for passenger ships?
   2. Holding ground. Is there good holding ground for 
       anchorage, or alternatively adequate sea-room for 
       passenger ships, within easy reach by zodiac?
   3. Landing sites. Are good landing sites available in a 
       wide range of weather conditions?
   4. Access. Is there easy access to features of interest 
       from landing points?
   5. Snowfields. Does snow impede access for any part of 
       the season?

B. Attractions for visitors
   6. Penguin populations. How many nesting species of 
       penguins are present?
   7. Other bird species. What other nesting or non-
       nesting species are present, and in what abun-
       dance?
   8. Sea mammals. Are seals likely to be seen on the 
       beaches? Are whales known to be present in the 
       area?
   9. Vegetation and soils. Are there interesting examples 
       of vegetation, soil development, patterned ground, 
       etc?
  10. Scenic attractions. Is the site scenically attractive? 
       Are there interesting geological features or rock 
       formations?
  11. Human presence. Are there relics of former occupa-
       tion, for example, by sealers or whalers? Is the site 
       currently in use?

C. Additional factors
  12. Past research. Has earlier work provided baseline 
       studies on which current and future impact assess-
       ments may be based?
  13. Research opportunities. Does the site offer re-
       search opportunities for monitoring possible visitor 
       impacts, with adequate control areas nearby?
  14. Fresh water. Is there a supply of fresh water 
       available in summer?

D. Counter-indications
  15. Are factors present that make this an unsuitable site 
       for regular visitor use?

These criteria have been applied to a number of sites 
that are in regular use by visitors, and will ultimately be 
applied to some 50 sites known to be used, as a basis for 
management plans and impact statements.

Acero, Favero, and Stonehouse also considered the 
need for a centre, other than one Half Moon Island, at which 
future studies of tourist impact could be made, and criteria 
for determining a site for such a centre were considered:

   1. The site for a research and visitors' information 
centre must meet all the criteria of a site suitable for 
visitors.
   2. In particular it must have an abundance and wide 
       variety of flora and fauna, enough to make it 
       inherently attractive to visitors.
   3. The site must be one that has been known and 
       studied over a number of years, to provide baseline 
       data.
   4. There must be enough space to provide for areas 
       that are heavily used, others less heavily used, and 
       others again in the immediate vicinity that are kept 
       visitor-free for use as controls.
   5. The site must already have, or be given, the status 
       of an SSSI or equivalent, to protect it against 
       intrusions that are not associated with its research.
   6. The site should preferably have an existing build-
       ing that can if necessary be modified for its new 
       purpose. There must be room for expansion with-
       out detracting from the attractiveness or scientific 
       value of the site, and a good landing point for the 
       additional stores and equipment needed by scien-
       tific parties working there.

Half Moon Island proved unsatisfactory on several 
counts. Though the island is easily accessible and affords 
safe landings, the single penguin colony is too small to 
allow separate areas for viewing, research, and control; 
there are not enough alternative attractions, and extensive 
snowfields make walking difficult well into mid-January. 
Of all other sites known to us, Harmony Cove, currently 
scheduled as part of the Harmony Point SSSI, came closest 
to meeting all requirements.

In subsequent talks in Santiago, Buenos Aires, and 
Cambridge, agreement was reached that IAA, INACH,

programme of research to be undertaken at a station to be 
determined, with partitioned responsibilities. It is consid-
ered important to begin work at the main centre as soon as 
possible, that is, to have a team in place in the 1992/93 
season. Research projects are being considered under the 
following headings:

1. Censuses of bird and seal populations
2. Non-invasive methods of monitoring the breeding 
   and energetics of pygoscelid penguins
3. Behavioural studies of interactions between pen-
   guins and visitors
4. Assessment of potential for providing educational 
   material and visitor information
5. Survey of site for impact studies and management 
   plan
6. Survey of vegewtation and patterned ground
7. Field studies toward visitor management
8. Establishing long-term monitoring studies
9. Implications of licensing tourist inspectors to moni-
   tor operations afloat and ashore.

High priority will be assigned also to a survey and 
annotated cataloguing of all landing sites currently known 
to be used by visitors. This will identify especially the sites 
where colonies or ecosystems are at risk, so that special 
management measures (for example, provision of wardens 
and special research programmes) can be made for them. 
Such a survey could be completed in two seasons by two 
surveyors working from vessels dedicated to the purpose, 
for example, chartered yachts or naval support ships. A 
second priority is to continue the study of visitors' attitudes 
and expectations, preferably on shipboard.

Introduction

A recent information release from the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO 1992) records that its membership, currently standing at 13, includes all the main cruise lines so far reported to be operating in Antarctica in the coming (1992-93) season. The release, which follows the association's annual round of meetings in Washington DC, describes the continuing success of the organization in representing a majority of operators of airborne and shipborne tours in Antarctica. For a comment on the founding meeting of the association see IAATO (1991).reported briefly in Polar Record (1991).This note assesses IAATO's record and its possible role in the development of legislation for Antarctic tourism.

Commercial tourism began in Antarctica in 1957-58. Its development, recorded in Reich (1980, 1982) and Enzenbacher (1992), has in the past been slow but seems now to be accelerating. More than 6000 tourists visited Antarctica during the 1991-92 summer season, most of them in tours ships. Comparable or higher numbers of tourists are expected in the coming season. From its start, the industry has projected an image of environmental concern that, both according to interested researchers (Naveen and others 1990; Stonehouse 1992a, 1992b) and to independent observers (Ackerman 1989; Wilkström 1991), seems on the whole to be justified by its behaviour in the field. My own experience on cruise ships indicates that environmental concern on the part of operators is an important selling point among Antarctic tourist clientele.

Many who undertake the expense and occasional discomfort of an Antarctic cruise have wide experience of ecotourism elsewhere in the world, and prefer to travel with companies that provide education and show environmental awareness.

The occasional disappearance of experienced operators from the scene (for example Society Expeditions and Salén Lindblad Cruising this year) and the influx of new companies into an expanding market reinforce the need for continuity of this environmentally sound tradition throughout the industry, encouraging all operators to aspire to the high standards set by the best. IAATO appears to recognize this need and expresses readiness to meet it.

IAATO operators' guidelines

The association, a US initiative. claims 'to encourage safe and environmentally-responsible cruises and expeditions to Antarctica, and to foster close cooperation between the companies concerned.' Members pledge to observe the environmental safeguards agreed upon by nations under the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) and reflected in national and international legislation. IAATO has published its own guidelines of conduct for both tour operators and visitors, guidelines that are claimed in some respects to go beyond legal requirements. Copies of these are available from the association.

IAATO Tour Operator Guidelines, designed particularly for shipborne operations, list 18 points. In summary, operators subscribing to IAATO are required:

1) to read and abide by the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978;

2) to be aware of and observe regulations affecting Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Specially Protected Areas;

3) to enforce the Visitor Guidelines [see below] in a consistent manner;

4) to hire professional teams of expedition leaders,
324 NOTES

planning Antarctic cruises, who are not yet in IAATO, to 
join: 'only by inviting all Antarctic tour operators to 
become members can we ensure that Antarctica remains a 
pristine destination for many generations to come.'

There are many calls for the urgent and careful revision 
of regulations relating to tourism under the ATS, both from 
institutional conservation groups (notably IUCN 1991) 
and from individual students of ecotourism (for example, 
Beck 1990; Marsh 1992). New legislation covering 
Antarctic tourism is expected to be drafted for discussion 
during the next few months. The Antarctic tourist indus- 
try, consistently maintaining its own standards of respon- 
sibility for three decades, has surely earned a hearing in the 
law-making process. With well-considered policies based 
on extensive field experience, IAATO seems highly 
qualifed to represent that industry's views.

Guidelines are not legally binding, and can be ignored 
or glossed-over by operators who choose to do so. This 
may be cited as a reason for the elaboration of ATS 
legislation to control tourism. As a simpler and more 
pragmatic approach, it could be argued that an industry 
that has for so long been self-monitoring requires little 
more than a formal inspection process, akin to that of 
internationally recognized inspections of fisheries or whal- 
ing activities, to ensure that agreed standards are met on 
all tours ships operating in Antarctic waters.

The ATS already provides for inspection of shipborne 
operations. Further, during the 1991-92 season, the Na- 
tional Science Foundation posted observers aboard three 
US tours ships for fact-finding purposes, with what appear 
to be wholly beneficial results. From these starting points 
it would seem simple to devise a corps of inspectors, 
similar in function to observers, but with a stronger role 
based on Treaty recommendation and national law, to 
travel aboard tours ships for the purpose of maintaining, on 
behalf of the ATS, standards based on those already 
prescribed and tested by IAATO.

I thank Debra Enzenbacher and Julie Marsh for 
comments on this note.

In addition to these guidelines, which cover mainly 
shipborne operations, IAATO has endorsed guidelines for 
operators of land-based private-sector travel to 
and within the Antarctic interior. The 14 points listed 
cover many of the issues mentioned above, plus others 
relating to safe operation of aircraft, provision of emer-
gency and back-up procedures, standards of training for 
pilots, guides, and support staff, maintaining radio con-
tacts with other operators and appropriate authorities, 
provision of safety and emergency equipment, fuel depots 
to cover emergency evacuations, camping, and medical 
equipment for enforced stays of up to 30 days, keeping 
away from wildlife, avoiding fuel spillage, and removing 
all rubbish and waste.

IAATO visitors' guidelines
The IAATO Antarctica Visitor Guidelines include 16 
points addressed directly to tourists and others, with expla-
nations and discussion. These may be summarized as 
follows:

1) Maintain a distance of at least 15-20 ft from 
penguins, nesting birds, and crawling seals; 50 ft 
from fur seals;

2) Be alert to the presence of wildlife and nests while 
ashore;

3) Do not get between a marine animal and its path to 
the water, nor between a parent and its young;

4) Be aware of the periphery of a rookery or seal 
colony, and remain outside it;

5) Do not touch the wildlife;

6) Never harass wildlife for the sake of photography;

7) Keep all noise to a minimum to avoid stressing 
animals;

8) Avoid walking on, stepping on, or damaging frag-
ile moss and lichens;

9) Take away only memories and photographs: do 
not remove anything else;

10) Return all litter to the ship for proper disposal;

11) Do not bring food of any kind ashore;

12) Do not enter buildings at research stations unless 
invited to do so;

13) Historic huts can be entered only when accompa-
nied by a proper authority;

14) Smoking is prohibited when ashore;

15) When ashore, stay with the group and/or one of the 
ship's leaders;

16) Listen to the expedition leader, lecturers, and 
naturalists: do not hesitate to ask them for guid-
ance.

The role of IAATO

These guidelines are by far the most comprehensive and 
practical guides to visitor behaviour available for Antarc-
tica; for a discussion of alternatives see Stonehouse (1990). 
Almost all could be faulted in detail (what are 'good 
judgement' and 'over-visitation,' and who determines 
when a photographer is harassing wildlife?), and some are 
biased toward US law. However, in practicality they 
appear to work closely with the government of Canada. It 
would surely be appropriate for IAATO to work in similar 
relation to the Antarctic Treaty System.

John Splettstoesser, a spokesman for IAATO, de-
scribes the association as providing 'a self-regulatory
