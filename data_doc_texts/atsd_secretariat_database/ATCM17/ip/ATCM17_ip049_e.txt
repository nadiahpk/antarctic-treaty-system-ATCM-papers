1      Introduction

Since XVI ATCM in October 1991 the following activities of 
WMO have occurred which are relevant to Antarctic Treaty 
items.

     (a)     The Expert Meeting on Antarctic telecommunications 
             was held in Geneva in October 1991.

     (b)     WMO was represented at XXII SCAR and at related 
             meetings of SCAR Working Groups and at COMNAP in 
             Bariloche Argentina in June 1992

     (c)     WMO Executive Council discussed Antarctic matters at 
             its meeting in June/July 1992.

Copies of the report of (a) have been distributed to national 
Permanent Representatives of WMO and through them to Managers of 
National Antarctic Program.

The principal results of these meetings are as follows:

2      Telecommunication Systems in the Antarctic - Report of 
       Expert Meeting

Following the trend in recent years some 75% of Antarctic 
meteorological data are now transmitted on satellite 
circuits, the other 25% by HF radio. The meeting supported 
the maximum use of satellite links for the transmission of 
data from Antarctica to the external world but recognised 
that HF links still constitute an important network within 
Antarctica itself. It was however recommended that 
operators continue to replace HF links by satellite 
circuits for more secure communications. The current data 
links are shown in Figs 1 and 2 which are updated versions 
(as at July 1992) of material included in the Report of the 
Expert Meeting.

The meeting considered that Antarctic telecommunication 
systems are generally satisfactory but noted that 
timeliness of data remains a continuing problem as there is 
often considerable delay between the times of observation 
and data availability to the meteorological community on 
the Global Telecommunication System (GTS). In order to 
further control this problem WMO will continue to conduct 
regular monitoring of bulletins at each of the World 
Meteorological Centres (Washington, Moscow and Melbourne). 
Results of the monitoring will be exchanged among the 
Centres with an aim of tracking down delays and 
establishing mechanisms for rectifying the situation. It 
has become apparent that with the increasing requirements 
of forecast centres in the Antarctic the exchange of 
processed data is becoming more important necessitating new 
code and transmission formats.
The WMO Working Group in Antarctic Meteorology will 
continue to keep Antarctic telecommunications matters under 
review. The Expert Meeting on Antarctic Telecommunications 
is expected to again meet formally in 1995 but regular 
monitoring and informal contacts will continue.

3     Networks and Observations

WMO discussions with SCAR groups and with COMNAP has again 
drawn attention to deficiencies in Antarctic Meteorological 
networks.

The basic surface observational network of manned stations 
at high southern latitudes has not changed greatly since 
the IGY and is shown in the upper panel of Figure 3.  In 
addition to this however has been the important development 
of the international fleet of buoys reporting via satellite 
which now provide basic synoptic surface data over the 
southern hemisphere ocean (see, for example, Figure 3. 
lower panel).  However, these are generally deployed and 
travel at latitudes well north of the Antarctic coastal 
waters and a need exists for more buoys to be positioned 
closer to the continent within the seasonal sea-ice zone. 
Several experiments have already established that 
appropriately designed buoys can survive and operate 
successfully in the pack ice.

As well as buoys there is an increasing number of Satellite 
reporting Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) located in the 
Antarctic.  The current number is in excess of 40. These 
have been primarily used for particular scientific 
experiments and tend to be clustered in particular regions 
such as the Ross Ice Shelf, but it is now becoming 
recognized that their output can be usefully employed in 
routine numerical analyses and operators are being urged to 
seek ways of inserting at least some of the data into the 
WMO Global Telecommunication System (GTS) for use at 
distant analysis centres.  The current upper air network is 
shown in Figure 4 and has also changed little from that of 
the IGY.

Examination of this overall network indicates some 
significant deficiencies among which are the absence of 
surface observations over most of the western Antarctic 
with the exception of the northern Antarctic Peninsula; the 
undesirable clustering (at least from the meteorological 
viewpoint) of stations on King George Island and the very 
poor upper-air coverage, particularly at 12 GMT over a 
large part of the continent.  Again, it is the western 
Antarctic sector which is largely devoid of data - a region 
which presents formidable logistic difficulties for 
approach from seaward and which cannot easily be supplied 
and staffed from existing coastal Antarctic stations.  It presents a 
challenge to future national Antarctic expeditions to 
rectify this problem and to make attempts to acquire 
meteorological data from this region by using reliable 
permanent AWS at fixed sites and by considering the 
operation of one or several manned upper-air stations.
In particular WMO notes the important component of 
Antarctic observations, services and research which has 
been contributed by the former USSR and expresses the hope 
that the level of activity in Antarctica will be maintained 
at as high a level as possible by Russia and the other 
republics of the former Union.

4    Improvement of Antarctic Meteorological Observations and 
Communications 

The following represents ways in which Treaty Parties can 
seek to improve Antarctic observations and communications.

•   Ensure on-going communications between the national 
Permanent Representative of WMO and the National 
Manager of Antarctic Programs so that WMO advice is 
available in planning Antarctic operations and 
programs.

•   Seek to rectify deficiencies of meteorological 
observational networks by:

    -   deploying Automatic Weather Stations at 
appropriate and "non-crowded" locations.

    -   deploying more ocean observation buoys at higher 
latitudes within the pack-ice zone.

    -   improving the frequency of observations 
(particularly upper air observations) at existing 
stations.

    -   filling gaps in the upper air observation 
network.

•   Note that operational meteorological data are 
valueless if they are not received in a timely manner 
and thus seek to improve wherever possible the 
communication channels (particularly using Satellite 
links) by which meteorological data are most 
effectively and efficiently inserted into the Global 
Telecommunications Network.
