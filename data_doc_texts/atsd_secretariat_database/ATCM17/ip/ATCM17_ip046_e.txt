ARCTIC MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME (AMAP).
A SHORT PRESENTATION

In June 1991 the ministers of the eight Arctic countries
signed the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy in
Rovaniemi (Finland). At that point the process had been
in preparation for two and a half years. The Arctic En-
vironmental Protection Strategy was designed to guide
development in a way that will safeguard the Arctic en-
vironment for future generations in a manner compatible
with nature. The Strategy points out the main threats to
the region and ways in which they can be combated.

According to the Strategy document, the main problems and
priorities in protecting the Arctic environment are:

   1. Persistent organic contaminants
   2. Oil pollution
   3. Heavy metals
   4. Noise
   5. Radioactivity
   6. Acidification

Following the UNCED conference in Rio last summer, also
known as the Earth Summit, at least climate change and
biodiversity could be added to this priority list. It will
be interesting to see what the ministers decide when they
meet for the second time to discuss the Arctic Environmen-
tal Protection Strategy next September in Nuuk, Greenland.

The Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy includes four
special commitments:

   1. Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme
      (AMAP) - Lead country: Finland
   2. Conservation of Arctic Fauna and Flora - Lead
      country: Canada
   3. Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment -
      Lead country: Norway (in collaboration
      with Russia)
   4. Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response
      in the Arctic - Lead country: Sweden

Finland is the present AMAP chairman, and Norway has been
generous enough to establish a permanent secretariat for
AMAP in Oslo.

The first AMAP Task Force meeting took place in Tromsö
(Norway) about a year ago. The Task Force agreed on the
organization of AMAP (Fig. 1) and on the rules of procedure
for the programme. It also decided how to proceed with
preparation of the programme on the lead-country principle
(Fig. 2).
At the first consultative meeting to prepare for the second ministerial conference on the protection of the Arctic environment, AMAP was given an additional task, namely to prepare an update on knowledge and knowledge gaps concerning geographical pollutant sources and the transportation pathways taken by pollutants reaching the Arctic ecosystems. The geographical areas subject to significant impact as a result of pollutant loadings would also be identified. The report would be structured to draw attention to issues which may lead to a ministerial decision and action at the 1993 meeting in Nuuk.

According to the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, development in, or affecting, the Arctic must be conducted on the basis of information about the impact of resource exploitation on the environment, ensuring that changes in nature are minimized.

Pollutants that affect the biological production and decomposition of organic material are the biggest threat to the Arctic environment. These pollutants may destroy large areas of the most productive Arctic ecosystems for ever.

The Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy calls for the inclusion of a comprehensive and careful environmental impact assessment (EIA) in all plans to exploit the natural resources of the Arctic. This demand is not in conflict with the long-term development of the economy and human welfare of the region - on the contrary. A thorough environmental impact assessment is imperative to ensure that the resources are sustainably used. A mere generation or two should not exhaust everything. This means for example, that from the very beginning, planning of the Northern Sea Route or planning the exploitation of off-shore oil and gas fields in the Barents Sea should also include a broad environmental impact assessment.

The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme will provide all levels of environmental impact assessment and decision making with data on the former, present and future state of the environment in the Arctic. It has been designed specially to monitor and detect man-induced changes in the Arctic environment.
