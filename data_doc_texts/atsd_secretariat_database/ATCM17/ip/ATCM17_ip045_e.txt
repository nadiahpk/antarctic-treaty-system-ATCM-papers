ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PLAN OF              
THE FINNISH AND SWEDISH ANTARCTIC STATIONS              
(Submitted by Finland)
Environmental impact assessment 
and management plan of the Finnish 
and Swedish Antarctic stations 

Finland joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1984. After joining the 
Treaty, in 1988-89, the research station "Aboa" was set up si-
multaneously with the Swedish station "Wasa" in the Norden-
skiöld base area (see map). The stations are in close coopera-
tion, and a common environmental impact analysis and mana-
gement plan of the stations is being drafted and is planned to 
be published in 1993. The content of the management plan is 
presented in the following pages. Common research program-
mes, such as FINNARP and SWEDARP have been organized at 
the stations, and the results have been published in 1991. 
Both Finnish and Swedish scientists have used the Finnish 
research vessel Aranda for marine research.
