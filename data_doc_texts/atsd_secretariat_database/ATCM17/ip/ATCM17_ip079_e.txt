Environmental Monitoring Agenda Item 9

During the debate in Working Group 2 it has been suggested that a few sites might be nominated as representative facilities to assess the nature and scale of their environmental impacts.

Should the ATCM proceed with the above approach China, Australia and Russia would be pleased to offer the Larsemann Hills region as a representative facility and to conduct a program of environmental monitoring of the impacts of the Chinese wintering station Zhong Shan, the Australian Summer base, Law, and the Russian Summer bases, Progress 1 and Progress 2.

o  This particular region is offered because significant human activities have only occurred in the past six years, it involves the cumulative impact of the facilities of three nations and the Chinese Antarctic Program has baseline data on snow, ice, water, air and soil from sampling prior to the establishment of significant human activity.

  The three nations also see benefits in a combined approach as this will assist in the transfer of the techniques developed to their other activities and to their input to the debate and development of this issue within the Treaty System.
