All beacons available on request.

3.	DAMOY POINT

(a)	Position:	DAMOY POINT, Wiencke Island, Palmer Archipelago, lat. 64°49'S, long. 
63°32'W. (Magnetic variation 16°E).

(b)	Height of runway above mean sea level:	about 46 metres. Uphill gradient 
SW to NE. Landing strip convex across its width.

(c)	Nearest station:	Small hut close to Dorian Bay with accommodation for 10-15 
persons. Used intermittently by British Antarctic Survey personnel during 
Antarctic summer season. Hut contains food and medical supplies.
Expected to be occupied from early November until early December for 
personnel routing to Rothera from Damoy, with party reporting by radio to 
Rothera Station.

(d)	Runway facilities:	Bearing of runway 050°/230° magnetic (approx. 3500 feet 
only).
This runway shows signs of considerable deterioration during mid to late 
summer, with crevassing becoming apparent parallel to the runway. Anyone 
intending to use it should contact Rothera for information about its 
serviceability. Skiway unusable late December to March.

(e)	Surface of runway:	Unprepared snow.

(f)	Period of operation:	Summer Operation (October-December for BAS air 
operations only).

(g)	Ground facilities:	No ground facilities.

4.	FOSSIL BLUFF

(a)	Position:	FOSSIL BLUFF, George VI Sound, lat. 71°20'S, long. 68°17'W.
(Magnetic Variation 23.5°East in 1980)

(b) Height on runway above mean sea level: about 92 metres. Slope up to south.

(c) Nearest station: Fossil Bluff lies about 1.6 km NNW of landing area. Food and medical supplies at huts. Station normally manned October–March, with party reporting to Rothera Station.

(d) Runway facilities: 
The skiway is 1200 m long and marked by drums on the west of the skiway.
The bearing is 203°/23°T. This landing area is an ice shelf in front of the hut and immediately on its western side is bounded by the steep-sided Bluff. Landing on 020° necessitates keeping close to the high ground before a low-level final turn onto 020°. During summer with high melt conditions the strip may become unusable, being either a small lake or a hard frozen area of sharp-edged corrugations.

(e) Surface of runway: Unprepared snow.

(f) Period of operation: Summer operation. Can deteriorate due to heavy melt in mid-summer season.

PART 3 WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR EACH FIXED SITE, FIELD CAMPS GENERALLY, AND FOR EACH SHIP.

1) Programs for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites:
Clean-up & Abandoned Bases - 1991/92

i) Deception Island - Continued clean-up of abandoned British base i.e. for-mate team assisted by the crew of the RRS James Clark Ross. Remaining fuel, batteries, hazardous wastes and general rubbish removed (90cm).

ii) Halley IV - Station closed at the end of February 1992. Clean-up of base carried out by a three-man team assisted by remaining station personnel. Virtually all hazardous wastes and the contents of the station were removed (120 cms).

iii) Signy Island - Continued clean-up of abandoned British base i.e. two-man teams. Remaining fuel, batteries and hazardous materials removed (20 cms). Clean-up team also helped in the clean-up of the newly re-occupied base by MSF.

iv) Inspection survey - Inspection survey carried out on all bases which still remain active during 1992.

2) Current and planned waste management arrangements, including final disposal:

i) Sewage, wet food waste and grey water are not removed from the Antarctic.

ii) General, non-hazardous waste is taken by BAS ships to the Falkland Islands where it is disposed of safely at Mount Pleasant. Combustible wastes (e.g. plastics, paper and cardboard) are burnt in a high temperature incinerator. Waste oils are burnt in a waste oil burner. Non-combustible wastes (e.g. metal, glass) are sent to a controlled landfill site.

iii) All hazardous and radioactive wastes are returned to the UK where they are safely disposed of by high temperature incineration.

3) Current and planned arrangements for analyzing the environmental effects of wastes and waste management:

i) Environmental monitoring programme established at Signy Research Station. Seabed studies are examining the impact of the sewage outfall on water quality, marine sediments and benthic animals, heavy metals in lichens on boulders running away from the base, and hydrocarbons in soil samples.

ii) Pollution monitoring programme established at Halley IV Research Station. Heavy metals in surface snow samples are being taken to establish the levels of pollutants around the base.

4) Other efforts to minimize any environmental effects of wastes and waste management:

i) Updated 2nd edition of BAS Waste Management Handbook planned for release by end of 1992.

ii) Drum crusher purchased for Rothera Research Station during 1992.

iii) Study to be undertaken during 1992/3 field season of wastes produced by field parties.

Note:- During the 1991/92 session a number of waste management and environmental monitoring
programmes have been developed at S[?]. They also monitoring:

i) the amounts of glass, aluminium and metal produced each month on site;

ii) the impact of the sewage outfall by taking samples of water marine sediments
   and organisms on a transect running away from the site across factory Cove;

iii) the impact of combustion emissions by taking samples of lichens from
   transects running away from the site in different directions;

iv) the impact of fuel spills by taking soil samples from sites located
    around the site.

Note:- At the end of February 1992, Halley IV was closed. The base was buried under
15m of ice and the pressure was crushing the station. A three - man team went in before
closure to make a detailed inventory and survey of the station, and to prepare a removal plan.
The team along with the remaining base personnel also completed the first stage of the
station clean-up and removed approximately 200m³ of waste material. During the
1992-93 season, a four - man team is to visit the station to complete the clean-up
before the station becomes too dangerous to enter and is sealed.

Note:-  Actual quantities of wastes from field camps cannot be given. Wastes are either 
        carried by field parties to the BAS research stations and amalgamated with station 
        waste, or else brought out and disposed of directly on the BAS (research) ships.
        The BAS operates a priority system for the removal of waste from field camps.
        first to be sent out are hazardous wastes (eg batteries) and fuel, followed by 
        plastics and then by general non-hazardous waste.
