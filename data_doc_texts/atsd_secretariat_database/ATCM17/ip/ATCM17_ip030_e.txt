ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMISSION
RELATED TO THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

(background summary presented by the IOC Secretariat to the XVIIth
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, November 1992, Venice, Italy)

The Southern Ocean, defined as the ocean region south of the sub-
tropical convergence zone, accounts for more than 20% of the area of the World
Ocean. It forms a zonal belt which links the southern Pacific, Atlantic and Indian
Oceans. It is an important component of the global ocean, with major sites of deep
water formation in the Weddell and Ross Seas. Phenomena and processes in the
antarctic region have an important role in global climate and environmental
changes. Any climate change is bound to affect the volume of the antarctic ice and
sea-level. The Antarctic and marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean-as the unique,
protected and little-studied region of the Earth, are especially sensitive to
global climate change and to effects caused by human activities. The remoteness,
the environmental and special requirements for observations require international
concerted efforts to understand the Southern Ocean and its role in global climate
change.

The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, created in 1960, has
an objective to promote marine scientific investigations and related ocean
services, with the view to learning more about the nature and resources of the
oceans through the concerted action of its members. 119 countries are at present
Members of the Commission.

Since 1960s the Commission has continued its efforts to promote and co-
ordinate scientific research and related ocean services in the Southern Ocean. For
this purpose the Commission established in 1967 the IOC Regional Committee for the
Southern Ocean.

Following decisions of the Sixteenth session of the IOC Assembly (1991)
and of the Twenty-Fifth session of the IOC Executive Council (1992) the major
efforts of the Commission in the Southern Ocean are concentrated on:

(i)     strengthening international research programmes in co-operation with
other international organizations (ICSU/SCAR, WMO, UNEP) dealing
with:

        -       study of the role of the ocean in global climate changes and
variability within the World Climate Research Programme,
sponsored presently by WMO, IOC, ICSU and UNEP. The World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) as a main ocean component of WCRP
(1990-1997) has a Core Project 2 "The Southern Ocean" totally
devoted to the Southern Ocean study.
        -       investigation of marine pollution through the joint IOC-UNEP
Programme on Global Investigation of Pollution in the Marine
Environment (GIPME) and its Marine Pollution Monitoring Programme
and Open-Ocean Baseline Study. The overall objective of GIPME is
to provide a scientifically sound basis for the assessment and
regulation of marine contamination and pollution. On this problem
IOC also co-operates with IMO, WMO, IAEA, FAO and other
organizations.
        -       study of the role of the ocean in global CO_(2) balance through its
scientific panel and by co-operating with SCOR in the Joint
Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) as a core project of IGBP which
includes the JGOFS Southern Ocean Study.
        -       ocean ecosystem dynamics study through the international GLOBEC
(Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) programme jointly sponsored by
SCOR, IOC and ICES, which includes the GLOBEC Southern Ocean
component.

(ii)    expansion and improvement of ocean observations and data exchange
through:

        -       increased support of existing operational programmes:
* Joint IOC-WMO Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS)
* IOC Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS)
* WMO-IOC Drifting Buoy Co-operation Panel activities
* IOC International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE)
System

        -       development of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) in co-
operation with WMO, UNEP and ICSU. This initiative of IOC has
received support by the UNCED (Rio,1992). In addressing critical uncertainties for the management of the marine environment and climate change called for states to "consider supporting the role of IOC in co-operation with WMO, UNEP and other international organizations in the collection, analysis and distribution of data and information from the oceans and all seas, including as appropriate through the proposed Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS)..." (Agenda 21, Chapter 17, Section E) As envisaged, GOOS as a comprehensive and integrated system will provide a mechanism for the co-ordinated management of data generated from regular satellite and in situ observations of major physical, chemical and biological properties of the world ocean. GOOS will provide for the ocean component of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) to be developed by joint efforts of WMO, UNEP and ICSU. The ocean measurements made today particularly in the Southern ocean are too coarse on temporal and spacial scale for documenting processes important to global ocean, climate and environtmental change. The Southern Ocean surrounding the continent of Antarctica, because of its vastness, the remoteness of this ocean from the nations that have historically conducted much of the research in this region, and the likely significance of this ocean region in global climate change scenarios, will require special attention and efforts in the process of design and planning of GOOS and strengthened co-operation of various international organizations dealing with various aspects of the Southern ocean (SCAR, SCOR, CCAMLR, WMO, FAO). GOOS when fully operational will provide sound basis for protection of the Antarctic Marine Environment within the "Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty".

The IOC Committee for GOOS at its First session in February 1993 will consider the next planning phase of GOOS.

(iii)    close interaction with other international governmental and non-governmental organisations

         -    IOC jointly with SCAR, SCOR and the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology of Germany sponsored the Antarctic Science Conference-International Conference on "Antarctic Science-Global Change" in Bremerhaven, Germany, 23-27 September 1991.
         -    Representatives of IOC took part in the recent meetings of SCAR and CCAMLR
         -    IOC has been invited to participate as an observer in the meetings of ATCM since 1989, and has attended.
