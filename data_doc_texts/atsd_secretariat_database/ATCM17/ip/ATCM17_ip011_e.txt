(Submitted by Germany)
INFO-Paper

Report on the Implementation in Germany of the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
(submitted by the German Delegation)

In Madrid on 4 October 1991, Germany signed the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and committed
itself to taking the necessary steps to secure its ratification
and entry into force as early as possible.
Germany also agreed to apply the provisions of the Protocol in the
meantime, as far as possible and in accordance with its legal sy-
stem.
It reiterated these commitments at the XVIth Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting in Bonn in October 1991.

Immediately after signing the Protocol, the German government is-
sued orders to all German government or government-sponsored in-
stitutions working in Antarctica to adhere strictly to the
regulations of the Protocol.

The German parliament now has to pass a law implementing the
Protocol in order to oblige all German citizens to do the same.

A draft proposal for such a law has been elaborated. It is at
present being discussed and reviewed within the administration.

There are good prospects that the ratification process for the
Protocol and its Annexes will be completed before the end of 1993.
