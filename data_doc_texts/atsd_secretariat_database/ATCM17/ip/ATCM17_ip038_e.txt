Opening Address by Mr. Akira Matsui,
Head of the Delegation of Japan

Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the Japanese delegation, I, first of all, would like to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your appointment as Chairman of the Seventeenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  I am confident that under your able guidance this session will attain its intended goals.

I would also like to express my appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Italy, H.E. Mr. EMILIO COLOMBO for the warm welcome which he kindly extended to us. I should like to express my delegation's most profound gratitude to the Government of Italy for hosting this Consultative Meeting.  I am sure that this Meeting here in this beautiful city Venice will add new lustre to the history of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and that it will long remain in the memories of all participants.

Mr. Chairman,

During the last year, we had intensive negotiations for the establishment of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and finally achieved to reach consensus on a package formula acceptable to all Consultative Parties.  I believe that the consensus we reached last year is no doubt a fruitful result of strenuous efforts by the Consultative Parties and it

overcome these problems with the spirit of cooperation
which we have demonstrated since the early stage of the
Antarctic Treaty System.

Mr. Chairman,

The Government of Japan has already determined to
play a positive role in international endeavour to
overcome the difficult issues such as global environmental
problems. In this context, the Japanese Delegation would
like to take this opportunity to reiterate that measures
for the protection of the Antarctic environment should be
strengthened further. Based upon this recognition,
Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure you that my
delegation is ready to make every effort to make this
Meeting successful.

Thank you.
