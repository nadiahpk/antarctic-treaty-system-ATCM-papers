COMPLIANCE WITH PROTOCOL      
(Submitted by Russia)
THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROTOCOL
WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AT RUSSIAN ANTARTIC STATIONS

Soviet Antartic Expedition SAE was one of the first national expedition to set up research coastal and inland stations. A great number of modern hardware and transport means was delivered to the continent this being beneficial to the investigation of the Antartic.

As a successor of the Soviet Antartic Expedition the Russian Antartic Expedition (RAE) has enherited not only invaluable scientific information, experience in implementing research studies and logistic operations, but also ecological problems in the vicinity of their stations. In view of this RAE places particular emphasis on the protection of environment in the region.

The main tasks of RAE are as follows:

- measures on removal of old hardware and equipement from station areas

- removal of large quantities of metal scrap and wastes from the areas of SAE activity;

- construction of modern ecological units including cleaning facilities and incinerators;

- dismanteling or updating the old logistics of SAE;

Recognizing the terms of the Protocol and its Annexes and realizing the need to observe them, the Russian Antartic Expedition has embrked on systematic protection measures on the managed territories;

- an ecological unit (cleaning facilities and incinerator) was put into operation at the Molodezhnaya station;

- construction of an ecological unit at the Bellinsgausen station is nearly completed;

- since 1989 seasonal activities have been conducted by specialized ecological teams provided with relevant equipment and hardware to ensure preparation and collection of metal scrap and wastes (Bellinsgausen, Progress, Molodezhnaya stations);

- next season it is planned to remove wastes and great amount of old hardware which is partially frozen into the ice at the Mirky Observatory;

- In February 1993 toghether with German colleagues it is
1
planned to carry out reconnessance in the area of
Novolazarevskaya and Georg Forster stations in view of sebsequent
recovery of the natural landscape.

This can be a good exemple of the Antarctic cooperation enabling
a mutually beneficial use of the potential of national Antartic
expeditions.

Despite complicated problems which RAE is facing, the Russian
side expresses its confidence that the above tasks will be
successfully completed by 1998.
