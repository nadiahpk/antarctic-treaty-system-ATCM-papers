OPENING STATEMENT BY MR NAUDÉ STEYN, HEAD OF THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN DELEGATION TO THE XVIITH ANTARCTIC TREATY 
CONSULTATIVE MEETING

Mr Chairman,

The South African delegation is very pleased and honoured to 
be able to attend this meeting here in Venice, with its 
unique charm and historical setting offering the ideal 
conditions for the deliberations which follow in the days 
ahead.  We wish to thank the Government of Italy for hosting 
this the XVIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

It also gives me great pleasure, to congratulate you on 
behalf of the South African delegation on your election as 
Chairman of this meeting, which we trust will be a 
successful one.  South Africa is looking forward to 
contributing towards the continuation and enhancement of the 
Antarctic Treaty System.

It is hoped that this Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
will lead to the establishment of a small Treaty 
Secretariat. We believe that such a Secretariat would act 
as an efficient and effective channel of communication and 
cooperation between all Treaty Parties.

Mr Chairman, Scientific Research has been undertaken for 
many years in Antarctica.  The South African delegation 
wishes to express its appreciation to the Scientific 
Committee on Antarctic Research for its sterling 
contribution in promoting research and disseminating 
research findings for the benefit of all.
Discussions on Environmental monitoring by ATCM-parties is a 
relatively recent development and it has now become 
imperative that scientific guidelines be established.

National Antarctic programmes as well as the international 
scientific community involved in Antarctica face the 
difficult challenge of designing and implementing 
Environmental Monitoring programmes anticipated in response 
to the Protocol. One of the most important aspects involved 
in developing such programmes will be financial 
considerations.

The expanding needs in the field of research and monitoring 
calls for increased cooperation between Treaty parties in 
the scientific and logistical fields. South Africa 
considers it important to assess these opportunities 
carefully as and when they present themselves.

In conclusion, we look forward to contribute towards the 
achievement of the objectives set at this meeting. Thank 
you, Mr Chairman.
