OPENING ADDRESS BY AMBASSADOR EVANGELOS FRANGOULIS,
HEAD OF THE GREEK DELEGATION

Mr Chairman

First of all I would like to congratulate you on your election as 
the Chairman of the XVII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

May I also through you, Mr Chairman, express my gratitude to the 
Italian Government hosting this XVII Consultative Meeting here in 
the beautiful city of Venice and also my thanks for its warm 
hospitality.

Mr Chairman
During the XVth Antarctic Consultative Meeting in Paris and also 
during the XIth Special Consultative Meeting in Vina del Mar and 
in Madrid the Delegation of Greece, has proposed views of its own 
and supported views of other delegations which have been included 
in the Protocol on Environmental Protection of Antarctica.

Greece can be happy for this outcome.  The above Protocol signed 
in Madrid on 4.10.1991 among others also by Greece will reinforce 
the Antarctic Legal System and will open up a new chapter for the 
development of the Antarctic environmental protection.  Greece has 
already translated this Protocol into Greek and has already 
submitted it for ratification to the Parliament.

Mr Chairman
The designation of the Antarctic Treaty areas as a natural reserve 
devoted to peace and science where exploitation and exploration is 
prohibited and the environment is subjected to a comprehensive 
binding regime of Protection, will further strengthen the 
importance of safeguarding the environment and protecting the 
integrity of the ecosystem of Antarctica and its seas surrounding 
this continent.

Mr Chairman
Greece believes that it is in the interest of all nations to 
preserve Antarctica and its waters for peaceful purposes only and 
to guard against their becoming the scene or object of 
international discord.

Mr Chairman
During the Venice meeting the delegation of Greece gives 
emphasis to the following issues:

1.  Formation of a small cost-efficient permanent Secretariat 
for the purposes of the Antarctic Treaty System

2.  Formulation of a liability regime according to Article 16 of 
the Madrid Protocol
3. Formation and Functioning of the Committee for Environmental 
Protection

4. Establishment of a tourism policy in the framework of the 
Madrid Protocol, regarding tourism activities in the Antarctic 
Treaty area.

Mr Chairman 
My delegation would like to hope that during this Meeting we 
shall be able to reach  a consensus regarding these themes.

Thank you 
Mr Chairman
