OPENING STATEMENT OF MR R. TUCKER SCULLY,

OPENING STATEMENT OF MR. R. TUCKER SCULLY,
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES

On behalf of the United States delegation, I would like to extend warmest congratulations to you on your election as Chairman of the Seventeenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XVII), and we are confident that, under your guidance, this Meeting will be successful. Our thanks also go to the Government of Italy for hosting us in Venice, this magical city which springs like a fountain from the Laguna Veneta.

• As the Antarctic Treaty enters its fourth decade of operation, it has maintained itself as a modern-day Magna Carta - conserving 10% of Earth as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science. And to this end, we must continue the serious work begun with the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to The Antarctic Treaty. We believe that early entry into force and effective implementation of the Protocal is the highest priority for the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty. We are pleased to report that all Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have now signed the Protocol, and that Spain has deposited the first instrument of ratification. My government has made progress toward ratification of the Protocol, with our U.S. Senate now having given its advice and consent to ratification.

• Entry into force of the Protocol will increase the requirements for coordination among the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, particularly in the areas of information exchange and availability. It highlights the need for moving rapidly to establish a Secretariat to support the institutional mechanisms of the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol. We must take care to ensure that such a Secretariat should be small and cost-effective, but we believe that its time has come.
Mr. Chairman, the United States is pleased that there are indications that there may be general agreement on establishment of a Secretariat of this nature. Here in Venice, we should concentrate on reaching agreement about those steps, both substantive and procedural, which will give birth to the Secretariat, and to ensure that it is in place by the time the Protocol enters into force.

● Mr. Chairman, there are other important items on our agenda. Tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica - perhaps visitation to Antarctica is a better word - is prominent among them. On this item, as well as regards the others on our agenda, we are prepared to examine the need for measures additional to those provided for in the Protocol. The Protocol builds on the Antarctic Treaty to provide a comprehensive system for protection of the environment and scientific values which all of us share. In the United States view, we must concentrate on those activities which will facilitate the rapid entry into force and implementation of the Protocol, and avoid steps which could slow down or complicate that process.

● This is the essential element of our approach to ATCM XVII. Again, we are delighted to be in this enchanting city on the occasion of this first Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Italy. Like others, we feel entirely at home.

Thank you.
