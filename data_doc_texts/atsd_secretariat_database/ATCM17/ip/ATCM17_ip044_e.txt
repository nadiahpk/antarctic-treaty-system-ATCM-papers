SCIENTIFIC AND LOGISTIC COOPERATION BETWEEN NORDIC COUNTRIES

Three Nordic countries Finland, Norway and Sweden, which are the consultative parties among 
the Antarctic Treaty countries, are cooperating in transportation of the expeditions to their 
Antarctic stations. Cooperation has been started as soon as Finland and Sweden acceded to the 
Treaty in 1984. The agreement concerning transportation in rotating turn was done a few years 
ago.

Finland started the agreed system last season. A commercial contract was done between the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry in Finland and the Arctic and Antarctic Research Intitute 
(AARI) in St. Petersburg. According to the contract transportation of the cargo and the 
personnel of Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish Antarctic expeditions were carried out to their 
stations ABOA, TROLL and WASA and back home by the R/V AKADEMIK FEDOROV.

  Both ship and helicopter transportation were carried out well and according to the plans and 
schedulcs. Scientific research was carried out mainly on land. Some research was done on 
board, too.

In coming season Norway is responsible for transportation. The Nordic scientists participating 
in the expedition have developed cooperation in scientific research that is very desirable for 
gaining better results.

For the season 1993-94 Sweden has invited scientists from Finland and Norway to participate 
in the expedition.
