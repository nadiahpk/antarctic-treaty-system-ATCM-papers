Maintenance, repair and restart of operation of the meteorological network, consisting of 12 automatic weather stations (AWS) located within a range of 150 km in the area surrounding Terra Nova Bay. The AWS collect data all the year round. During the summer campaign data from the AWS are integrated with those from other meteorological stations and radio sounding ballons.

Earth science (national coordinators: Meloni,  A.,  ING, Roma; Ricci, C.A., Universita' di Siena)

Activities will consist mainly in the maintenance of the seismic observatory (1 Very-Broad Band seismic station) and the geomagnetic observatory (1 magnetometric station).

The volcanological observatory consisting of  5 clinometric stations and 4 seismic stations located on Mt Melbourne will also be controlled and put into operation again.

Glaciological observations will continue with the positioning, by means of a GPS, of some other data points on the following glaciers: Drygalski, David, Strandline, Tarn Flat, Priestley and on Browning Pass.

AMUNDSEN-SCOTT SOUTH POLE STATION (USA)

Also this year two Italian investigators will be at the Station to continue summer observations on stratospheric aerosols by means of the LIDAR installed there during the summer 1987-88. They will also carry on the yearly maintenance of the equipment and the training of personnel who will operate the instrument during the Antarctic winter.

One Italian investigator will work at the Station to 
optimize the seismic and the gravimetric stations put 
into service last year. The installation of the two 
stations has been done with the aim to undertake a 
structural and tectonic-evolutionary study of the 
Antarctic Margins and of the Scotia Arch.

DUMONT d'URVILLE STATION (FRANCE)

One Italian engineer from a private firm (Quanta Systems) 
will be at Dumont d'Urville to operate the LIDAR DIAL 
(POLE) realized, in the framework of a cooperative 
program, to study the ozone vertical profiles, polar 
stratospheric clouds and tropospheric clouds. This 
equipment has been continuously working from February 
1991.

SODAR measurements will be undertaken by one Italian 
investigator.

One Italian expert will take part to the French traverse 
on the Antarctic plateau leaving from Cape Prud'homme 
(Dumont d'Urville) towards Dome-C.

GANOVEX VII (GERMANY)

The airborne magnetic surveys started last year in 
cooperation with German scientists will continue. Three 
Italian investigators will participate to GANOVEX VII.

McMURDO STATION (USA)

The study of polar stratospheric clouds with the Italian 
LIDAR, started during 1990-91, continued also this year. 
Two investigators have been working at the Station during 
the period mid August - early October.

PART 3      WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR EACH FIXED SITE,
            FIELD CAMPS GENERALLY, AND FOR EACH SHIP.

1 )   Programs for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites:
................................................................................
................................................................................
................................................................................

2 )   Current and planned waste management arrangements, including final disposal:

All wastes were retrograded to and disposed of in New Zealand.

Next season, because of the limited number of the expedition members and the short 
permanence, wastes will be stocked at the station to be retrograded at the end of the following 
summer season.

3 )   Current and planned arrangements for analysing the environmental effects of wastes and 
      waste management:

A new chemico-physical water treatment plant was tested; the effluents were monitored.
................................................................................

.48.

4 ) Other efforts to minimize any environmental effects of wastes and waste management :
The Mercedes power generators have been included in the cogeneration system.

For the next summer season efforts are made to reduce volumes and quantities of packaging 
materials; detergents are preferred that are packed in recyclable plastics (PE) and that are 
concentrated .
