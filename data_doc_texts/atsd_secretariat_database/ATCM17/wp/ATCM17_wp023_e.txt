COMPULSORY INSURANCE OF TOURISM AND NONGOVERNMENTAL
ACTIVITIES IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

(Agenda item 13)

(Submitted by Russia)

To ensure adequate regulation of tourism and nongovernmental
activities in Antarctica, to enhance the interest of the states and
national Antartic programs in promoting such activities, and to
pro-vide guarantees against the damage resulted from such activities,
the Russian delegation suggests that a system of compulsory insurance
should be established. The system could include the following basic
elements.

1. The Governments of the states which are Consultative Parties to
the Treaty or the autorized organizations jointly entrust one of
trustworthy world insurance companies (hereinafter referred to as an
authorized company) with compulsory insurance of any tourist and
nongovernmental expedition to Antarctica.

2. Modality of the Antarctic insurance is developed by the
authorized company and approved by the Consultative Meeting.

3. The authorized company shall direct a part of insurance
payments to the states having Antarctic scientific stations in whose
vicinity the activities of tourist and nongovernmental organizations
are anticipated.

4. In case of any damage to the Antarctic environment and/or the
states involved in the research activities in Antarctica, the
authorized company shall transfer the due insurance reimbursement to
the secretariat. The next Consultative Meeting shall distribute the
- 2 -
payment among the states which sufferred direct damage or had to take 
up the expenses to cope with the consequences of the damage.

5. The Parties to the Treaty and their national Antarctic programs 
commit themselves to render no assistance (apart from rescue 
operations from humane considerations) to those organizations and 
their transportation means which had not gone through the procedure of 
compulsory insurance.

The Russian delegation suggests that the above considerations be 
preliminarily disoussed by other delegations.
