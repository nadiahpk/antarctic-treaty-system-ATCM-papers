ANNEX I

PLANNED ACTIVITIES

CONSTRUCTION OF SEASONAL BASE "GEZEL-I"

The seasonal base GEZEL-I was constructed from 18 December- 22
December Iyy0.

In constructing the base by the D.P.R.K. party joined the Soviet
expeditioners, too.

Necessary materials were transported from the R/V AKADEMIK FEDOROV
and Mololojnaja station by two MI-8 helicopters.

The base consists of 4 huts, a diesel power station and ground
meteorological observation with different kinds of apparatus.

The total area of the base is I57.6M.2

Logistic supports were done by 2 Soviet technicians and a medical
doctor.

The programme carried out at the GEZEL-I consists of meteorologi-
cal, gedetic, geological, topographical, biological and sea  ice
condition observation and researches.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMES

A. Atmospheric Sciences

Meteorological study

Location: Oasis Tereshkova

Activity: During the period from 28 December I990- 3I March
I99I at the GEZEL-I base meteorological observation
programme was conducted.

In the base an automatic meteorological station DMK
and other meteorological observation apparatus operated.

The meteorological parameters were measured every
three hours; 0, 3, 6, 9, I2, I5, I8, 2I GMT.

The measured parameters are: air temperature (inclu-
ding minimum and maximum temperature), IO minutes
average wind, pressure, pressure tendency, relative
humidity, visibility, quantity, type, and height of
cloud, atmospheric phenomena.

The project was successful yielding high quality data 
for various kinds of studies of atmosphere.
Using these data, some analysisses including the syno-
ptic analysis were conducted.

B. Geodetic work
Locations: Oasis Tereshkova and Larseman Hill.
Activity: Geodetic measurement was conducted in both places 
using trigonometrical measurement method.
After the measurement topographic charts were made 
up with the scale of I:500, I:1000 and I:2000.
The charts can be used for designing stations.

C. Observation on sea ice condition
Location: Oasis Tereshkova and Larseman Hill.
Activity: Visual observation on sea ice condition was conducted 
in both places.
The major aim of the observation is to define a favo-
urable period for navigation.
In this observation special attention was paied to 
icebergs and pack ice behaviour.
Thickness of the sea ice and snow cover was measured 
in the Oasis Tereshkova.

D. Geology
Location: Oasis Tereshkova.
Activity: General geological and topographical survey was con-
ducted in this area and surroundings.
Samples of different kinds of minerals were collected 
and analysed.

E. Biological observation
Location: Oasis Tereshkova.
Activity: During the operation of the GEZEL-I biological obser-
vation was conducted on different kinds of animals 
including flying birds, penguins, and seals were ob-
served and samples of some kinds of mosses collected.
