EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
(Agenda Item 7 (d))

Through its different organism, the Antarctic System promotes the exchange of information among its members in order to coordinate and favour International cooperation in the fields of scientific, logistic, operative, tourist, fishing and other activities.

The XVI ATCM showed that the exchange of information's pattern created a substantial increase in the quantity of information given, a large part of which does not achieve its main objective.

The main problems in the exchange of information stem from the need to revise the contents of Recommedation VIII-6, the provision of other recommendations, to analyse the unreliability of the exchanged information, to seek a standardization system for formats aiming at up-dating of this exchange on the basis of computer science system (computers, networks, data banks, electronic mail, etc.):

It is important to point out that in some cases authorities and officers have met difficulties and proved to be inefficent in transmitting, requiring and/or using information among parties involved in the Antarctic process, since this information is not always useful nor suitable for them.

On the basis of the above-mentioned elements, the Chilean Delegation proposes the analysis of the following actions to find a comprehensive solution to the problem of the exchange of information:

a) Summary of documents and proposal on this issue put forward by the Parties of the Treaty during the most recent consultative meetings.

b) Appointment of a group of experts formed by representatives of the various conventions, SCAR and COMNAP/SCALOP.

c) On the occasion of the next ATCM the group of experts is to present a proposal on a system of general, specialized, reliable and standardized, simplified, exchange of information which should be based on computer science (computers, electronic mail).
