LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE ARISING ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE 
IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA (LIABILITY ANNEX)

Agenda Item 6.c

(Submitted by The Netherlands)
Paper, submitted by The Netherlands for discussion at the XVIIth ATCM, Venice 1992.

Liability for damage arising activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty Area (Liability Annex)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

Article 16 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid, 4 October, 1991) provides that the parties "...undertake to elaborate rules and procedures relating to liability for damage arising from activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty area...". 
Furthermore, the activities referred to are those, covered by the Protocol on Environmental Protection and the regime to be developed "shall be included in one or more Annexes" to the Protocol. The Annexes will be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9 (2) of the Protocol.

It is in view of this commitment and of the belief that the creation of a liability regime constitutes a fundamental aspect of the common goal to comprehensively protect and preserve the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems that the Netherlands submits this Discussion Paper for consideration at the XVIIth ATCM.

Apart from this Introduction, the content of this paper consists of the following paragraphs:
# General (par. 2.);
# Procedure (par. 3.);
# Substantive aspects (par. 4.)

2. General

When developing a liability regime for adverse environmental impact arising from activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty
area, the following observations seem to have general validity 
and may be taken into account:

a) From the outset, Parties may recognize that a balance should 
be found between the various activities involved and the (poten-
tial) harmful effects on the environment, in elaborating the lia-
bility rules and principles. It seems appropriate to recognize 
that certain activities are central to the operation of the Ant-
arctic Treaty System (ATS) and are of global importance (i.e. 
scientific research), while others are of a fundamentally diffe-
rent nature (for example tourism). Certain activities are gene-
rally considered to (potentially) cause greater harm to the envi-
ronment than others. This is to be reflected in a future liabili-
ty regime.

b) the liability regime must, where appropriate, take account of 
existing rules and principles of international law. During the 
first phase of the discussions, Parties should try to indentify 
conventional and customary rules and principles which may be of 
use.

c) the regime must reflect the specific character and nature of 
the sensitive Antarctic environment; activities that are normally 
not harmful to the environment may entail substantive environmen-
tal risk when undertaken in Antarctica.

d) discussions on the to be developed liability regime should 
benefit from and take account of earlier discussions undertaken 
within the ATS (most notably CRAMRA); Parties should indentify 
what findings and principles may be retained or are indeed in 
need of adaption.

3. Procedure

The coming ATCM should aim at a decision on the establishment and 
terms of reference of an open-ended Group of Experts on a Liabi-
lity Annex. Preferably, the Parties should agree on the working 
program of such an Expert Group. Parties should aim at the con-
clusion of a Liability Annex within a reasonable periode of time.

4. Substantive aspects

With respect to the mote substantive elements of a viable liabi-
lity regime, several issues and questions should be considered by

2
the Expert Group. The following list of issues and items may be 
considered useful, although it is by no means regarded as an ex-
haustive list:

a) Four basic issues are involved which may be useful when deve-
loping a liability regime for the Antarctic environment:
# the concept of strict liability;
# the principle of limitation of liability;
# the requirement of obtaining adequate insurance;
# the possibility of establishing an Antarctic Environmental Fund 
(see also infra).

b) Starting from the presumption that a distinction can be made 
between different categories of activities in the Antarctic Trea-
ty area, one category needs special attention: shipping. Here, a 
large body of international law already exists, like, inter alia, 
the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution 
(1969, amended in 1984); the International Convention on the Es-
tablishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil 
Pollution Damage (1971); the International Convention on Limita-
tion of Liability for Maritime Claims (1976).

c) In situations in which environmental damage may exceed limits 
set, the cause of damage can not be determined or the responsible 
party may not be able to meet the obligation, the functions of a 
Fund could be considered to provide for the additional funds re-
quired to restore the ecological integrity. In addition, the Fund 
- the modalities and operation to be discussed at a later stage-
might be used for purposes of response and/or emergency 
operations.

d) The Minerals Convention can be a useful source from which to 
draw elements and principles that may be included in a Liability 
Annex. The Expert Group should identify and, if necessary, adapt 
such principles.

e) What functions, if necessary, can be developed for the Envi-
ronmental Protection Committee and the ATCM with respect to a 
liability regime? Can the ATCM perform, under certain circum-
stances, the function of "plaintiff"?

f) Is there a need to provide for a provision to the effect that 
Parties should ensure that recourse is available under domestic 
law?
