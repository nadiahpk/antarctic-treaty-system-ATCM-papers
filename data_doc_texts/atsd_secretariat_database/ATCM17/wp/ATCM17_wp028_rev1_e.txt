Draft Recommendation

Global Change Research and International Cooperation in Antarctica

(Item 12)
(Submitted by Chile)

The Representatives,

Recalling articles II & III of the Antarctic Treaty and article VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and Recommendation XV-14 on the promotion of international scientific cooperation.

Reaffirming the Declaration adopted at the XVIth Consultative Meeting on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty,

Noting the recognition in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development of the importance of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean for the study of global changes processes,

Acknowledging the role that intensified coordination of national research programmes and increased international cooperation should play according to SCAR's publication on "The role of Antarctica in Global Change",

Conscuous as well that the development of an implementation plan for the Antarctic contribution to the International Geosphere and Biosphere Programme represents a significant step to be accomplished during the Decade of international antarctic scientific cooperation (1991-2000) proclaimed by the XVI ATCM,

Recommend to their Governments that they:

- Welcome the decision adopted by the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research at XII SCAR to establish a new group of specialists on global change and the Antarctic, in order to provide linkages and communications between national programmes, SCAR working group and other groups of Specialists in areas of relevant Antarctic research.

- Encourage SCAR to articulate, in close cooperation with COMNAP, a management structure to implement a coordinated programme for global change research in the Antarctic and to contribute through the development of Regional Research Centres (RRC's) to the IGBP System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) and to other major regional and international programmes on global change research.

- Support initiatives such as the proposal of the SCAR Working Group on Biology and the offer made by Chile to hold a workshop on the coordination of biological research on King George Island (Isle 25 de Mayo); the Cooperative geoscience of the South Shetland Island (COGS) whose second workshop was sponsored by the National Institute of Polar Research of Japan; and similar
initiatives to coordinate research in glaciology and solar-
terrestrial studies.

- Note with appreciation the completion of SCAR's proposal for
coordinated Antarctic research (the role of Antarctica in Global
Change: part 2) to be published late in 1992 and the plan to
implement a regional programme of global change research in the
Antarctic, through:

    i. continuing identification of high-priority research needs in
       process studies, monitoring and modelling;
   ii. identifying other needs in the implementation of the programme
       such as logistics, data management, etc.;
  iii. organizing workshops and symposia to synthesise and discuss
       research results.

- Recommend that the above mentioned regional programme of Global
Change research in the Antarctic should be given a high scintific
priority and supported to the greatest extent possible by
governments.

- May consider applying to the Global Environmental Facility
(GEF) and other acceptable funding mechanisms to support the
proposed new group of specialists and their work.
