ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

Recoognizing and confirming the importance of the issue of Antarctic environment monitoring, as well as enormous work done by the Buenos Aires Expert Meeting, the Russian delegation holds it necessary to make a number of proposals to the Recommendations set forth in Paper Info 9.

    1. At the initial implementation stage of the Antarctic monitoring project, the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty should focus on the monitoring of pollutants and environmental parameters such as ozone which have a significant impact on biological activity.

    2. To invite SCAR to develop proposals on establishing an observational network for Antarctic environment monitoring based on operating Antarctic measurement facilities such as stations, bases, vessels, aircraft and satellites.

    3. To invite COMNAP to note the equal contributions from national Antarctic services to the establishment of the observational environmental monitoring network.

    4. To invite SCAR to carry out specific activities to organize the intercalibration of instruments and methods for collection and analysis of various environmental samples.

    5. To recommend to Antarctic Treaty Parties which make no contribution to the observational environment monitoring network that they focus on funding a project on the Antarctic environment database.
