ITEM 6(B) - COMMITTEE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

(WORKING PAPER SUBMITTED BY AUSTRALIA)
DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE - COMMITTEE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION (CEP)

.       Draft Rules should reflect the provisions of Articles 11 and 12 of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

.       They should also have regard to and draw upon the Rules of 
Procedure for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (revised 
1987), notably in relation to the Conduct of Business, Languages, 
meeting Secretariat, Committees and Working Groups and Amendment 
provisions

Participation

.       Pursuant to Article 11 of the Protocol, each Party to the Protocol 
shall be entitled to be a member of the Committee and to appoint a 
representative who may be accompanied by experts and advisers

Timing of Meetings of the Committee

.       Given that it has been agreed that the ATCM should now meet on an 
annual basis, and in the first half of the year, meetings of the 
Committee should, as afr as possible, be held in tandem with and as 
part of the Consultative Meeting

-       decisions on the timing of the ATCM and its CEP should be 
taken at the end of the previous ATCM, in consideration of a 
recommendation by the CEP to the ATCM

        provision should be made for meetings of the Committee to take 
place separately from the ATCM, if ATCPs agree this is 
necessary for the CEP to fulfill its obligations under Article 12 
of the Protocol. Decisions on the convening of any such 
Meeting should be on the basis of a recommendation by the 
Committee to the ATCM, or upon request by a Party

        in the case of any meetings not held in conjunction with an 
ATCM, the Treaty Parties might delegate to their 
representatives at that Committee Meeting authority to make 
decisions on matters referred to in Article 12 of the Protocol

        in the case of emergencies or unforeseen developments which 
require prompt action by the Committee, the incoming ATCM 
host nation should consult with Parties on means for 
addressing the issue, including through consultation or, if 
required, an inter-sessional meeting of the Committee

Observers

.       Pursuant to Article 12 (2) of the Protocol, representatives of SCAR 
and the Scientific Committee of CCAMLR shall be invited to attend as 
observers. Subject to the approval of the ATCM, the Committee 
may also invite such other relevant scientific, environmental and 
technical organisations which can contribute to its work to participate 
as observers. The latter invitation should be raised through a 
recommendation by the Committee to the ATCM but may also be
raised between sessions by a Treaty Party for consideration at the Embassy preparatory meeting.

Officers

.       At each meeting the Committee shall elect a Chair from one of the Consultative Parties. The Chair will be supported by a representative of the ATCM host nation, given that the latter nation will have provided support for the Committee in the lead-up to the Meeting

Support for the Committee

.       Account should be taken of any possible decision on the establishment of a Secretariat (under discussion at Item 7(a)

provision of support to the CEP would be an important function of the Secretariat

.       In the interim, the incoming host nation should provide the following support for the Committee. This will include maintaining a record of and providing advice to the elected Chair of the coming meeting on the receipt of:

        notifications of and responses to environmental emergencies

        notifications made in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Protocol and contingency plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol

        draft CEEs, received under Article 3 of Annex I

        information circulated under Article 6 of Annex I (list of IEEs, description of national procedures etc))

        information on permits issued under Annex II, and

        Parties' Waste Management Plans (and reports on implementation and review) as required under Annex III

Reports

.       The Committee shall provide a report on each of its sessions to the ATCM. It shall cover all matters considered at the session and shall reflect the views expressed. It shall be circulated to Parties and thereupon be made publicly available.

Decision-making

.       The Committee shall take its decisions by consensus. However, with respect to decisions on advice that shall be provided on CEEs, the Party responsible for that CEE shall not participate in the decisions.
