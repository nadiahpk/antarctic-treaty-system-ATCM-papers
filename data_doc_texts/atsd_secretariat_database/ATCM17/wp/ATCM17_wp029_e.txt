Agenda Item 6.c            

(Working paper submitted by Chile and the Netherlands)
Draft decision submitted by Chile and the Netherlands to be included in the
Final Report of the Seventeenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting

Agenda item 6 c.

( ) The Meeting discussed under item 6 the question of future action with
respect to the obligation in Article 16 of the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to undertake to
elaborate rules and procedures relating to liability for damage arising
from activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty area and covered
by the Protocol, with a view to their inclusion in one or more Annexes.

( ) The Meeting reiterated the wish expressed in the Final Act of the
Eleventh Antarctic Treaty Special Consultative Meeting that work on
their elaboration could begin at an early stage and acknowledged the
importance of developing a liability regime as being significant for
the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent
and associated ecosystems.

( ) The Meeting, therefore, agreed to convene a meeting of experts in
accordance with Recommendation IV-24 to undertake to elaborate rules
and procedures relating to liability as called for under Article 16 of
the Protocol.

( ) It was further agreed that prior to the convening of that meeting and
in order to ensure adequate preparation of its work, proposals should
be prepared and exchanged by the normal means of diplomatic
communication. On the basis of agreement reached through diplomatic
channels a first meeting of experts will be convened before the XVIIIth
Consultative Meeting.
