Hydrometeorological services
for marine activities in the Southern Sea

The service, providing hydrometeorological support to the Russian Antarctic Expedition has been formed for the recent 15 years.
At present it has to offer:

- the only really existing monitoring of the Southern Polar Region: satellite monitoring of sea ice and ice coastline;

- a wide range of weather forecasts (marine, aviation, general) from 1 to 7 days.

- specialized ice information support for navigation in the 240 dregree longitude sector of Antarctic (120°W - 0 - 120°E).

Upon request of any ship or body, ice analysis charts and forecasts, expected ice conditions of navigation, including recommended routes, are provided 10 months in advance.
The ice charts, prepared at the Molodezhnaya and Bellinsghausen stations are distinctive by their completness and reliability as compared to other ice analysis provided upon request.
Besides, long-term ice forecasts for the Southern sea produced by the Arctic and Antarctic Institute have no analogues in the world.

On the basis of gathered meteorological and satellite information, users can be provided with:

- weather charts for the Southern Hemisphere (sea and 500m levels) for 00 GMT
- Nephanlysis charts and "Meteosat" messages based on the data of AES;
- forecasting surface and height pressure fields in the GRID code
- daily forecasts for ships and stations
- three-day forecasts for stations and ships
- aviation weather forecasts for routes and aerports
- 10-day and monthly reports of ice conditions on Antarctic coast-line
- classification of ice processes by forms and types
