HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS
(Submitted by Argentina)

In 1903 Argentina organized a special expedition to
Antarctica to give assistance to the Swedish expedition, led
by Dr. Otto Nordenskjold, which remained isolated owing to
the sinking of the ship.
On 10 November, at Penguins Bay, Southern coast of Seymour
Island (Marambio), Ross Archipelago, the expedition found a
camp with members of Dr. Nordenskjold's expedition, who were
taking eggs and penguins for a possible third wintering in
the area. The crew of the corvette "Uruguay" left food
supplies and a wooden plaque on which they carved the
following words: 10. XI. 1903 (Argentine Navy) in its
journey to give assistance to the Swedish Antarctic
expedition.
The members of Dr. Nordenskjold's expedition were then
transported to Buenos Aires and the wooden plaque was left
in memory of the meeting. Furthermore, the plaque has always
been kept eversince by Argentina and was accompanied by a
rock cairn erected in January 1990 in memory of this event.
There is no text to extract from the image. The image appears to be a black-and-white photograph of an object, possibly a stone or metal slab with some markings or carvings on it, but it does not contain any readable text.
