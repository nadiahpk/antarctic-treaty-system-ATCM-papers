problem, so we confine ourselves to the practical sides of the 
issue without touching upon the status of Rec and we use the word 
Important to qualify the Rec. which will be in the list.

B. The Handbook is a very important historical document to 
understand how the Antarctic Treaty system has developed since 
1959. it is more desirable to keep the Handbook intact. so our 
proposal is to add a new set of reference to those imnortant Rec.

C. Preparation of such a list could be entrusted to the Editor 
of the Handbook or the Secretariat if the ATCM agrees that it 
should be established in the near future.

Steps to be followed

A list of Important Recommendations has to be drawn up and 
submitted to the Parties for consideration. Then the agreed list 
will go to the Editor of the Handbook. When the Protocol and its 
relevant Annexes enter into force. those . Recommendations 
overlapping with the Protocol and its Annexes have to be removed 
from the list. When there are new important Recommendations. 
which the ATCM will adopted they will be added to the list.

If the Parties see merits in the proposal. they would adopt a 
recommendation with this regard at the present meeting. For that 
purpose, a draft recommendation has been prepared.
