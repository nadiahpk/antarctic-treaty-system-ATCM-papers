Outreach Activities on occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the signing of the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
Working Paper submitted by Argentina and Chile

Summary
On occasion of the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to be celebrated in 2016, Argentina y Chile suggest that a debate on proposals for the dissemination of the work carried out by the Parties and the Committee for Environmental Protection be initiated, for their entry into force and implementation. Such outreach tasks should be targeted to the international community at large and, in particular, to the community of the States Parties to the Madrid Protocol, who have supported this work with their contributions. 
Introduction 
The 25th anniversary of the signing of the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, to be celebrated in 2016, provides a great opportunity for the dissemination of the work carried out since the entry into force of the Protocol. 
Over the last 25 years, specially, since the beginning of the work of the Committee for Environmental Protection in 1998, established with the purpose of “providing advice and giving recommendations to the Parties in connection with the implementation of this Protocol, including the operation of its Annexes, for consideration at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings”, the Parties' work has been dynamic and steady. 
The accession and ratification of the Madrid Protocol by a greater number of States after its signature in 1991 demonstrate the agreement's efficacy and ever-growing scope. So far, the Protocol has been ratified by 35 countries, 29 of which are Consultative Parties. 

The topics discussed by the Committee for Environmental Protection, as advisory body to the Antarctic Treaty on the implementation of the Protocol are often related to topics whose interest and relevance go beyond the scope of the Antarctic Treaty, such as the debates on climate change and its effects on the Antarctic continent. 

Such development of the Parties' steady work in connection with the implementation of the Protocol would not have been possible without the support of each of the member States, taking into account the resources they have allocated for the sustained growth of its associated internal institutions and the adjustment of their Antarctic activities and facilities to the standards set forth by the Protocol, together with the resources they have supplied to support the ongoing work of the Committee for Environmental Protection and its delegates.  
The 25th anniversary of the Madrid Protocol as an opportunity for dissemination 
In this context, Argentina and Chile consider it appropriate to pool their efforts in order to spread information on the work carried out throughout these 25 years, with a view to increasing the visibility of achievements and reaching out to members of the community without regular exposure to Antarctic issues. In addition, such dissemination may help to strengthen support in the future, making it possible for the Committee for Environmental Protection to face the challenges posed by current work areas.

Particularly, Argentina and Chile suggest considering the possibility of preparing an online publication, written in simple language for the community at large, which may be circulated among various governmental and non-governmental, academic and education environments, among others. 

Argentina and Chile believe that greater involvement by the Parties will enrich the final product and contribute to its dissemination within each country.  The initiative may be channelled through different structures, either by the creation of a widely represented editorial committee, by the establishment of an intersessional contact group or by any other arrangement the Parties may consider appropriate. Argentina and Chile are willing to work on this or any other dissemination projects, under such modality as the Committee may find more appropriate. 

 This publication may take into account the following topics, among others: 

    • The work carried out by the Committee for Environmental Protection and progress made on the issues dealt with; 
    • The provisions set forth under the Measures, Decisions and Resolutions; 
    • The newly created management tools (Guidelines, Manuals, Procedures, etc.), 
    • The organisation of thematic workshops; 
    • The creation of a Subsidiary Group on Management Plans, 
    • The establishment of the CEP web-based forum, available at the ATS web page for supporting the work carried out by the Intersessional Contact Groups. 
    • The development of the CEP Five Year Work Plan; 
    • The addition of new Annexes to the Protocol, after its signing (such as Annex V and VI) and the review of Annex II.  

If this or any other dissemination channels are considered of interest by the Committee for Environmental Protection, Argentina and Chile suggest that the work modality be agreed upon within the Committee for Environment Protection and that any content should be strictly approved by consensus by the Committee, and be available in all four Antarctic Treaty official languages in order to preserve the spirit of consensus existing within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty.
Recommendation
Argentina and Chile recommend that the CEP:

    • Acknowledge the importance of spreading information to the international community on the steady work carried out under the Antarctic Treaty System for the implementation of the Madrid Protocol. 
    • Encourage the Parties to begin exchanging ideas in order to explore potential courses of action, such as the possibility of preparing an online publication for spreading information on the work carried out within the framework of the implementation of the Madrid Protocol, as well as its current and future challenges, for public dissemination in 2016.  
    • Consult the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat on the support that the latter could provide to this proposal.
