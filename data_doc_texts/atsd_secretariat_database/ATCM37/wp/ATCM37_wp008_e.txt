Report from ICG on Climate Change

Background
At CEP XVI, SCAR submitted an update to the Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment (ACCE) Report (WP 38). This represented a major update of the original ACCE report and summarised subsequent advances in knowledge concerning how the climates of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean have changed, how they might change in the future, and the associated impacts on marine and terrestrial biota. In submitting this update, SCAR suggested that there needs to be further efforts on implementing the recommendations of the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME) on climate change and implications for Antarctic management and governance (2010). 

The Committee noted the pace of change reported in the ACCE update and recalled that the ATME on climate change had recommended that the CEP consider developing a climate change response work programme (ATME Recommendation 19).

Based on this discussion (para 61-68 in CEP XVI report), the Committee established an ICG on climate change with the following Terms of Reference:

    1.  Review progress made against ATME recommendations 18 to 29 drawing on SP008 (CEP XV) and discussions at recent CEP meetings (cf: CEP report 2010 paras 351 - 386);
    2. Consider these ATME recommendations in light of recent papers and in particular SCAR's 2013 major update report in order to identify additional actions that may need to be addressed by the CEP;
    3. Consider how the recommendations might be addressed by developing a prioritised climate change response work programme; and
    4. Provide an initial report to CEP XVII.
The Committee agreed that the United Kingdom (Rachel Clarke, British Antarctic Survey) and Norway (Birgit Njåstad, Norwegian Polar Institute) would jointly coordinate and lead the ICG. 


CEP CCRWP
The ultimate goal of the ICG is to develop a Climate Change Response Work Programme (CCRWP) for the CEP.  Participants in the ICG agreed that a CCRWP would usefully set out goals and specific actions by the CEP to support efforts within the Antarctic Treaty System to prepare for, and build resilience to, the environmental impacts of a changing climate and the associated implications for the governance and management of Antarctica. 

Preparing a draft CCRWP for consideration at CEP XVIII will be the main focus of the second period of the Climate Change ICG, building on the preparatory work carried out by the ICG to date, as summarized in this WP.


ICG approach
The ICG agreed to a stepwise approach to the development of a climate change response work programme that involved consideration of: 

    1. the status of ATME recommendations 18-29 (ToR 1)
    2. other climate-related issues subsequently discussed by CEP and/or arising from SCAR’s ACCE major update report (ToR 2)
    3.  decisions/steps already taken by the CEP with regard to these issues [i.e. the ATME recommendations and any other issues identified under bullet point 2] (ToR 2)
    4.  remaining needs and required actions by the CEP (ToR 3)
    5. how, who and when to move these action points forward (ToR 3)
    6. compiling identified actions into a draft prioritised CCRWP for the CEP (ToR 3).

The first intersessional period has covered the first three points on this list, and initiated work on the fourth. The ICG coordinators facilitated this discussion through posting an initial notice and two consecutive discussion papers on the CEP Discussion Forum. The documents, as well as responses received, can be accessed through the website. During the discussions five members (Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa and US), the two countries of the coordinators, and four observers and experts (ASOC, CCAMLR, SCAR and WMO) have contributed substantially and positively to the discussion. 


Status of ATME recommendations
ICG ToR 1 requested the ICG review progress made against ATME recommendations 18 to 29, drawing on ATCM XXXV/SP and discussions at recent CEP meetings.  It was also noted that CEP XIII identified ATME recommendations 4, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, and 17, in addition to recommendations 18– 30, as relevant for the CEP agenda1. The ICG updated the status overview provided in ATCM XXXVI/SP 72, identifying completed and ongoing processes answering to the relevant ATME Recommendations. The updated overview is attached (Annex 1), and provides a background for the further ICG discussions. 


Other climate related issues not covered by ATME recommendations
The ICG ToRs require that the ICG, based on new knowledge and recent discussions, consider the incorporation of additional issues not covered by the ATME Recommendations. Issues that arose during the ICG discussions include:  

    • Ocean acidification [risk type/threat]
    • Changing ocean and marine ecosystems [threatened value and research need]
    • Warming terrestrial ecosystems [threatened value and research need]
    • Ozone [risk type/threat]
    • Black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants [research need]
    • Permafrost [risk type/threatened value]
    • Cultural remains [threatened value] 
    • Mapping/baseline biodiversity [research need]
    • Clean-up of past waste disposal/abandoned work sites [management action and research need]

Climate Change Matrix 
The ICG developed a Climate Change Matrix (CCM) as its working tool to record the output of the ICG discussions. The CCM is attached (Annex 2). In the CCM the ICG grouped the ATME recommendations (and the additional items in the above paragraph) into themes or issues relevant for governance and management. It was noted that the CCM could be structured in various ways, but that the primary purpose was to ensure that all relevant issues are captured in one place.

The first column of the CCM categorizes relevant themes/issues (including sub topics) that need to be considered when formulating the CCRWP (such as risk types, management tools/approaches/actions, and knowledge and understanding), providing a rationale for these themes/issues in the second column. The themes largely arose from the Climate Change ATME recommendations as reflected in the third column. The fourth column provides an overview of completed and ongoing processes answering to ATME recommendations (ie. a synthesized reflection/summary of the information provided in the updated ATCM XXXVI/SP 7 (Annex 1)).

The fifth column of the CCM aims to identify specific remaining questions/gaps/needs that the ICG believes should be considered in the CCRWP. The ICG has initiated these discussions, and will continue this process in the second period of the ICG.  The ICG will then identify who, how and when to tackle these issues/items (to be incorporated into the last column of the CCM). This discussion will be initiated as one of the main elements of the second year of the ICG. 

The ICG coordinators recognize that the CCM could be further developed into the CCRWP by including the future prioritization of actions and agreeing those responsible for their delivery.  Although the structure and content of the CCRWP has yet to be agreed, it will likely reflect the CEP 5-year work plan (for easy incorporation/integration when adopted).  


Conclusion
The ICG on Climate Change has had a constructive year of discussion which has provided a basis for the key elements of the work of the ICG, namely identifying climate change response needs and consideration of how to follow them up. In this process the ICG has:

    • Updated the status of ATME recommendations through an updated version of ATCM XXXVI/SP 7 (Annex 1)
    • Identified and categorised climate change themes/issues relevant for governance and management, and developed a framework for further ICG discussion, i.e. CCM (Annex 2)
    • Initiated discussions on items/elements that need to be incorporated into the CEP CCRWP (column 5 and 6 of the CCM).

Proposed next steps
Building on the work of the first intersessional period, we propose the ICG completes the following tasks:

    • Consider the need for and if appropriate agree to an over-arching objective statement
    • Identify further specific actions (complete sixth column of the CCM)
    • Prioritise the specific actions agreed upon
    • Identifying those responsible for undertaking the specific actions agreed on
    • Agree on the format of the CCRWP
    • Prepare the CCRWP for submission to CEP XVIII. 

The ICG requests that the CEP:
    • Acknowledges the progress of the work done by the ICG on Climate Change
    • Provides input/feedback on the content of the CCM, especially the identification of further specific actions required (sixth column of the CCM)
    • Agrees that the ICG continues its work, completing the tasks set out above, to meet the remaining requirements of the ToR
    • Asks the Secretariat to continue to update the overview of ATME recommendations (currently the updated version of XXXVI/SP 7), in line with recommendation of CEP XIV3.
