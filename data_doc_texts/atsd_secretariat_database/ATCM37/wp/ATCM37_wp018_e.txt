Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 169 Amanda Bay, Ingrid Christensen Coast, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica









Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 169 Amanda Bay, Ingrid Christensen Coast, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica
Working Paper submitted by Australia and China
Summary
In accordance with Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia and China have undertaken a five-yearly review of the management plan for ASPA 169 Amanda Bay. Australia and China recommend that the CEP approve the attached revised management plan. The reviews were conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide) appended to Resolution 2 (2011). The following sections briefly describe the Area, and describe the proposed amendments arising from the review of the management plan.
Background
The Amanda Bay ASPA is located adjacent to Prydz Bay on the Ingrid Christensen Coast of Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica at 69°15’S, 76°49’E. It was designated under Measure 3 (2008) following a proposal by Australia and China, primarily to protect the breeding colony of several thousand pairs of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). The colony possesses intrinsic and scientific values. The collection of long-term population monitoring data in the Area is valuable for comparative studies with other emperor penguin colonies in East Antarctica. ASPA 169 is designated for an indefinite period. A revised management plan for ASPA 169 is provided at Attachment A.
Summary of amendments to the management plan for ASPA 169
    • There are no changes to the Area boundary. 
    • There are no major changes to the description of the Area.
    • Section 2 has been modified to include the objective of minimising the possibility of the introduction of pathogens which may cause disease in the emperor penguin colony.
    • Section 3 and Section 7(ii) have been modified to include new and updated measures to mitigate the potential impacts of helicopter operations upon the emperor penguin colony.
    • The location of automatic cameras – installed to monitor the colony and ice conditions – has been noted in Section 6(iii). 
    • Section 7(iii) has been modified to prevent human interference to the emperor penguin colony during periods of acute sensitivity. 
    • Improved and updated maps have been incorporated. 
    • Editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the Guide. 
Recommendation
Australia and China recommend that the CEP approves the attached revised management plan for ASPA 169 Amanda Bay, Ingrid Christensen Coast, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica (Attachment A).
