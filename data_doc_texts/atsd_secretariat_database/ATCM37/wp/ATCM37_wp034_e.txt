IEE or CEE: which one to choose?

IEE or CEE: which one to choose?
Presented by France and Belgium
Summary
Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection are the basis for determining which criteria should apply whenever the environmental impact is being assessed in a particular area. The environmental impact in the case of an initial evaluation or IEE is minor or transitory, whereas in the case of a comprehensive evaluation or CEE it is more than minor or transitory. However, a close analysis of the IEEs and CEEs that have been published on the Secretariat’s website shows that the interpretation given to the concept of “minor or transitory impact” can vary significantly from one Party to another. Moreover, activities which are a priori similar in nature are sometimes assessed by some Parties to be within the framework of an IEE, yet they can assessed by other Parties to be within the framework of a CEE.  
In this document the authors propose the development of a definitive list of those activities that should be systematically considered as having a “more than a minor or transitory impact” on the environment, and thus require the systematic implementation of a CEE.  Such an approach could help to reduce some of the potential differences between Parties in defining a number of activities and in assessing their environmental impacts. The authors propose that an intersessional contact group be tasked with exploring and developing such a List. 
Background
Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection require that every Party undertake a prior assessment of all the environmental impacts likely to be caused by an activity being planned within any area of the Treaty. Following a preliminary evaluation, the activity can either:
    • proceed (if the predicted impacts of the activity are likely to be less than minor or transitory); or
    • be preceded by an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE), if predicted impacts are likely to be minor or transitory; or
    • be preceded by a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE), if the predicted impacts are to be more than minor or transitory.

Conscious of the “need to elaborate general principles for the development of environmental impact assessments in order to fulfil the requirements of the Protocol”, the Consultative Parties adopted Guidelines for the evaluation of the impact on the environment of Antarctica in 19991. Revised Guidelines were adopted by ACTM XXVIII – CEP VIII (Stockholm) in Resolution 4 (2005). Such guidelines provide to the Parties the principles that they need to follow so as to comply with the Protocol in terms of Article 8 and Annex 1.  However they also highlight the difficulty of defining the term “minor or transitory impact” and furthermore they explicitly state that “the interpretation of this term will need to be made on a case by case site specific basis”.
The lack of any agreed definition for the terms “minor” and “transitory”, and as a result the lack of any clear understanding of the impact made by human activities on the environment, have already been the subject of discussions within the CEP and the ATCM2, notably through analyses of some of the environmental impact assessments (EIAs) made by a number of Parties3. Such analyses have demonstrated that the impact predicted for similar activities can be understood differently among the Parties and can lead to the development of an initial environmental evaluation (IEE) as equally as they can lead to a comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE). At the same time the analyses have also led to a call for the Parties to exchange information on their environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and to take into account the impact’s cumulative effects. In addition, it has been suggested that the environmental impact may be better understood in terms of the status given to the site where the activity has been taking place: a site can be already disturbed in an irreversible manner, another site that may be disturbed but not irreversibly so, and yet another site may be considered as pristine and undisturbed4. 
Objectives
There have been significant and ongoing discussions regarding a number of environmental impact assessments that have been presented in the ATCMs recently. These discussions demonstrate that the issue, as outlined above, remains. Our approach consists in a comparative analysis. We have sought to analyse the CEEs submitted since the adoption of the Environmental Protection Protocol, and to compare these CEEs with the IEEs that are available in the database of the Secretariat of the Treaty. We would like to thank the Secretariat for its assistance in helping us to use the appropriate data.
Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the widely diverse interpretation that the Parties give to the terms “minor” and “transitory”.  Our analysis also contributes to a better understanding of why Parties choose to conduct their environmental impact assessments within different EIA frameworks (IEE versus CEE) even when the activities are ostensibly quite similar.
CEE Analysis
We have examined the CEEs stored in the “EIA database”, 30 entries in all, for the period 1998-2014. When there are two versions of these CEEs, one preliminary and one final, we have retained and examined the final version only. Our analysis therefore is based on 17 CEEs (see the Annex).
In the documentation there is a field, “Topics”, which the Parties have to fill, by ticking a topic or topics from a given list, as appropriate. The Parties can tick any number of topics so as to provide a brief description of the activity being assessed. The CEEs, when examined, lead us to identify four main topics:
Construction / operation of facilities	10 CEEs
Drilling (ice/rock)	  		  5 CEEs
Oil management / salvage	 	  1 CEE
Traverse				  1 CEE

Results or findings from a CEE can vary significantly even for the same activity: for example, among the 10 CEEs dealing with the construction of a new station, five conclude that the impact will be more than minor or transitory, four conclude that the impact will be minor or transitory, and one CEE does not provide a conclusion which uses those terms.
In regard to the impact of drilling, the divergence in finding among the 5 CEEs dealing with this activity is even more acute.  Perhaps, however, these extremely divergent findings can be explained as a result of some of the distinctive characteristics of this activity, such as the use or not of a drilling compound, the liquid’s composition, the depth of the drilling, or the logistics deployed when drilling occurs.
IEE Analysis 
IEEs as stored in the database of the Secretariat are not always fully accessible online.  As a result we limited our analysis to the 753 IEEs presented to the ATCM since 2002. The topics that they cover, and their frequency, are shown in Table 1.  These topics can be compared to the topics covered by the CEEs.
The “Construction /operation of facilities” topic applies to 104 IEEs, 50 of which have only this topic ticked off and no other. The topic is wide-ranging and diverse and covers a significant number of activities, all very different in nature. For instance it may involve the installation of scientific equipment (such as radomes or antennae), the erection of wind turbines, the building of new plants (such as processing plants for waste, or else for oil-based products), the development and use of a quarry, the creation of roads or of docking facilities, the implementation of extensive renovations, and even the construction of new buildings on the site of a former station. 
A number of IEEs, 21, are also listed under the topic “Field camp”.  Two of these IEEs list only this topic; 19 others list the topic in conjunction with other topics, and in our opinion these IEEs could also be considered as pertaining to the “Construction / operation of facilities” field, since the activity can be similar to that conducted by stations within the framework of a of a CEE.
It may be worthwhile to revisit, in greater depth, the 19 IEEs presented under the topic of “drilling”. Some of the activities as described in the IEEs involve deep drilling, or the use of a drilling compound, or even significant logistics deployment in the field. These types of activity, in other cases, have been assessed within the framework of a CEE.
One noteworthy fact is that the only IEE listed under the topic "Traverse" concludes that should the impact of this activity be localised in a particular area, it can well produce, in specific instances, an environmental impact that is more than minor or transitory.
It is also worth pointing out that a number of topics such as “Oil management / salvage”, “Removal / clean-up of facilities”, “Site management/remediation”, “Waste management” all involve the same general kind of activity associated with waste-processing.  Again, in other instances this is an activity dealt with mostly in terms of a CEE.
Furthermore, it is be noted that whereas there is a significant number of IEEs dealing with non-governmental or touristic activities, not a single activity which is non-governmental or touristic in nature has been assessed in terms of a CEE, even if impacts from such activities can result in cumulative effects.

Conclusion
The analysis we have conducted, even if preliminary, clearly shows the diversity that prevails among Parties as to their understanding of the general impact of a given activity. The divergence amongst Parties applies even more when an activity is compared to another activity which is very similar in nature. It is in accordance with their interpretation of the activity’s impact that a Party then chooses to follow either of the procedures (IEE or CEE) for environmental impact assessments as outlined in Annex 1 of the Protocol.   


The assessment criteria brought to bear to apply either a CEE or an IEE for a particular activity is on the basis of its impact being defined as “minor or transitory” or as “more than minor or transitory”, as outlined in Article 8 and in Annex 1 of the Environmental Protection Protocol. We suggest that the CEP could contemplate the need to adopt a number of general principles with the aim of creating more uniformity and homogeneity in the choice of which procedure should apply for environmental impact assessments. This would be of particular pertinence for those activities that are ostensibly similar in nature. For instance, a list could be drawn up of activities that are major and that should systematically be deemed to have an impact which is “more than minor or transitory”, thus that should be considered only within the framework of a CEE.5
To this end, should the CEP believe this to be an appropriate and useful approach, we propose to lead an intersessional contact group whose terms of reference could be as follows:

    1. To further our analysis by identifying the precise features and characteristics of activities which up to now have been equally assessed as within the framework of either an IEE or a CEE, and to monitor each Party’s interpretation of the specific nature of the activity’s environmental impact in either a CEE or an IEE 
    2. To reflect on the necessity to produce a list of all those activities that should, unquestionably, be analysed for their environmental impact only within the framework of a CEE
    3. To report on the above to CEP XVIII.
