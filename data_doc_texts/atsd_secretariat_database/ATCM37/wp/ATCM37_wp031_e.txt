Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on 2013/14 Intersessional Work
Working Paper submitted by Norway on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
During the 2013/14 intersessional period the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP), in accordance with its Terms of Reference #1 to #3, reviewed seven draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) management plans and one draft Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) management plan referred by the Committee for intersessional review. 
The SGMP recommends that the Committee approves the attached five revised management plans:
    • ASPA No. 141: Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay 
    • ASPA No. 128: Western Shores of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands 
    • New ASPA: High altitude geothermal sites of the Ross Sea region 
    • New ASPA: Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land
    • ASMA No. 1: Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands

Furthermore, the SGMP advises the CEP that further intersessional work will be conducted with regards to three management plans submitted for intersessional review:
    • ASPA No. 144: ‘Chile Bay’ (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 145: Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 146: South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago (Chile)

The SGMP had no tasks relating to its Terms of Reference #4 and #5 during the intersessional period. 
    1. Background
During the 2013/14 intersessional period the SGMP operated in accordance with the work plan agreed by CEP XVI (Final Report, para. 131), and the Terms of Reference adopted by CEP XIII (Final Report, Appendix 1):
    1) Examine any draft new or revised Management Plan to consider, in consultation with relevant experts if appropriate:
    • whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol, particularly Articles 3, 4 and 5, and with relevant CEP guidelines;
    • its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness;
    • whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation; and
    • whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole.
    2) Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.
    3) Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management Plan, identifying where the Plan reflects comments received by Members, and where they have not been, the reasons for not doing so. The Working Paper is to include all revised Management Plans and the information required by the ATCM’s Legal and Institutional Working Group.
    4) Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review.
    5) Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent and likely to be effective.
The SGMP was convened by the CEP Vice-Chair, Birgit Njåstad from Norway. Representatives from Argentina, ASOC, Australia, Chile, Germany, IAATO, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, SCAR, United Kingdom and United States were registered to participate within the SGMP framework, noting however that all plans are available for comment from any CEP member during the SGMP process. Discussions took place by correspondence, using the CEP Discussion Forum and email.
    2. Review of the revised draft management plans 
ASPA No. 141 Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay 
At CEP XVI Japan submitted Working Paper 6 Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.141 Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay. The CEP recommended referring the plan for intersessional review (para 117 of the CEP XVI Final Report). No specific observations with respect to this draft management plan were recorded in the CEP XVI Final Report. The SGMP’s review of the management plan was coordinated by the SGMP member from Australia.
On 30 July 2013, the SGMP convener issued an invitation to all CEP contact points to submit comments on the draft management plan. 
In October 2013 the SGMP provided its initial advice to the proponent, recommending some modifications to the draft revised management plan submitted to CEP XVI in ATCM XXXV/WP6. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponent provide further details and clarification regarding:
    • monitoring activities conducted in the Area 
    • the location of vegetation and snow petrel breeding areas
    • enhancements to the maps 
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications, the plan would adequately address the provisions of Annex V and relevant CEP guidelines, and was likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and objectives for management of the Area. 
In January 2014 Japan provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice. Japan made further changes to the text and maps to address minor outstanding issues.
The resulting final revised draft management plan is presented in Attachment A to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared by the proponent are presented at Appendix 1.

Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the revised management plan prepared by Japan for ASPA 141 Yukodori Valley (Attachment A).



ASPA No. XX [NEW PROPOSAL] Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land 
At CEP XVI Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation submitted Working Paper 63 Draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plan for Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land. The CEP recommended referring the plan for intersessional review (para 128 of the CEP XVI Final Report). No specific observations with respect to this draft management plan were recorded in the CEP XVI Final Report. The SGMP’s review of the management plan was coordinated by the SGMP member from New Zealand.

On 30 July 2013, the SGMP convener issued an invitation to all CEP contact points to submit comments on the draft management plan. 
In October 2013 the SGMP provided its initial advice to the proponent, recommending some modifications to the draft revised management plan submitted to CEP XVI in ATCM XXXV/WP63. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponent provide further details and clarification regarding:
    • More clearly identifying and describing the ASPA boundary;
    • Providing further details on access to the Area;
    • Specifying how sampling of the geology (a finite resource) will be managed/catalogued between users of the Area; and
    • More clearly identifying how this proposed ASPA would complement the protected area system (noting that the primary reason for designation is to protect outstanding geological values).
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications, the plan would adequately address the provisions of Annex V and relevant CEP guidelines, and was likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and objectives for management of the Area. 
In February 2014 Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining their responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice. Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation made a further minor change to the text to address a factual mistake.
The resulting final revised draft management plan is presented in Attachment B to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared by the proponent are presented at Appendix 2.

Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the revised management plan prepared by Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation for ASPA [XX] Stornes (Attachment B).

ASPA No. 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands
A draft revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands was in 2012 submitted to CEP XV and referred to the SGMP for review by the Committee. SGMP reviewed the plan in the 2012-13 intersessional period and provided advice to the proponent in November 2012 in accordance with its work plan. In February 2013 Poland advised the SGMP that Poland and the United States had been in discussion regarding ASPA 128, and that they had agreed to initiate closer cooperation with regard to future management of this ASPA. On basis of this agreement the two countries had noted the need to have some additional time available to develop the revised management plan for the area, and indicated a one year delay in order to have the necessary time for discussions and further development of the plan. The CEP agreed to continue consideration of this plan by the SGMP in the 2013-14 intersessional period. The SGMP’s review of the management plan was coordinated by SGMP member from Chile and the SGMP convener.
In December 2013 Poland and the United States provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining their responses to the SGMP’s advice (from the 2012-13 intersessional period). 
In January 2014 the SGMP provided its advice to the proponent, recommending some modifications to the submitted draft revised management plan. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponent provide further details and clarification regarding:
    • Management of the non-native grass Poa annua
    • Access provisions
    • Management of human waste
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications, the plan would adequately address the provisions of Annex V and relevant CEP guidelines, and was likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and objectives for management of the Area. 
In February 2014 Poland and the United States provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining their responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice. Poland and the United States made further changes to the text and maps to address minor outstanding issues.
The resulting final revised draft management plan is presented in Attachment C to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared by the proponent are presented at Appendix 3.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the revised management plan prepared by Poland and the United States for ASPA 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay (Attachment C).

ASPA No. YY [NEW PROPOSAL] High altitude geothermal areas of the Ross Sea region
A draft Management Plan for a proposed new Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) for High altitude geothermal areas of the Ross Sea region was in 2012 submitted by New Zealand to CEP XV and referred to the SGMP for review by the Committee. SGMP reviewed the plan in the 2012-13 intersessional period and provided advice to the proponent in October/November 2012 in accordance with its work plan. In February 2013 New Zealand advised the SGMP that it had decided to postpone the high altitude geothermal ASPA for a year, needing more time to finalize the revised plan (including maps) on basis of field work to be conducted  over the next Antarctic season. They indicated that such postponement also will give them sufficient time to address comments from the SGMP (and other Parties) and ensure a high quality management plan. The SGMP’s review of the management plan was coordinated by the SGMP member from the United Kingdom.
In October 2013 New Zealand provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice (from the 2012-13 intersessional period). 
In December 2013 the SGMP provided its advice to the proponent, recommending some modifications to the submitted draft revised management plan. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponent provide further details and clarification regarding:
    • Area boundaries
    • Access provisions.
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications, the plan would adequately address the provisions of Annex V and relevant CEP guidelines, and was likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and objectives for management of the Area. 
In January 2014 New Zealand and the United States provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice. New Zealand and the United States made further changes to the text and maps to address minor outstanding issues.
The resulting final revised draft management plan is presented in Attachment D to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared by the proponent are presented at Appendix 4.
In putting this management plan forward, the SGMP notes that one point raised in its advice to the proponents was the possible need for wider discussions on biosecurity measures to protect microbial communities in geothermal areas more generally. The CEP may wish to give further attention to this issue.
As this new proposed ASPA incorporates the former ASPA 118 and ASPA 130, and the new management plan is intended to replace the two existing management plans, the SGMP notes that there remains an outstanding question for the CEP to consider regarding the consolidation and/or de-designation of these two ASPAs.  
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the revised management plan prepared by New Zealand and the United States for ASPA No. [YY]  High altitude geothermal areas of the Ross Sea region (Attachment D).
The SGMP further recommends that the CEP advise the ATCM that as a consequence of adopting this new ASPA the current ASPA 118 [The summit of Mount Melbourne] and ASPA 130 [Tramway Ridge, Mount Erebus] should be de-designated as protected areas. 
 
ASMA No. 1 Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands
At CEP XVI Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Poland submitted Working Paper 54 Rev 1. Review of the Management Plan for ASMA No.1: Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands. The CEP recommended referring the plan for intersessional review (para 117 of the CEP XVI Final Report). At CEP XVI it was noted that this draft management plan also would need to be considered by CCAMLR (cf. para 115 of the CEP XVI Final Report). The SGMP’s review of the management plan was coordinated by the SGMP member from Chile and the SGMP convener.
On 30 July 2013, the SGMP convener issued an invitation to all CEP contact points to submit comments on the draft management plan. 
In October 2012 the SGMP provided its initial advice to the proponent, recommending some modifications to the draft revised management plan submitted to CEP XVI in ATCM XXXV/WP63. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponent provide further details and clarification regarding:
    • special zones 
    • access provisions 
    • management of the non-native grass Poa annua
    • management provisions relating to harvesting/fishery activities in the area
    • mandate and composition of management group.
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications, the plan would adequately address the provisions of Annex V and relevant CEP guidelines, and was likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and objectives for management of the Area. 
In February 2014 Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Poland and the United States provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining their responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice. Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Poland made further changes to the text and maps to address minor outstanding issues.
The resulting final revised draft management plan is presented in Attachment E to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared by the proponent are presented at Appendix 5.
As noted in the Report of CCAMLR-XXXII (paragraph 5.83), the Commission agreed that, consistent with the procedure established in ATCM XXVIII Decision 9 (2005), any proposal to undertake commercial harvesting within an ASMA should be submitted to CCAMLR for its consideration and approval.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the revised management plan prepared by Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Poland, and the United States for ASMA 1 Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands (Attachment E).

ASPA 144 “Chile Bay” (Discovery Bay)
A draft revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 144 ‘Chile Bay’ (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands was in 2012 submitted to CEP XV and referred to the SGMP for review by the Committee. SGMP reviewed the plan in the 2012-13 intersessional period and provided advice to the proponent in October 2012 in accordance with its work plan. In February 2013 Chile provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice, although at the same time flagging the need to be provided opportunity to consider the updated maps Chile had indicated would be submitted shortly. In April 2013, Chile advised the SGMP that it would not be possible to finalize the revised maps for the ASPA in due time for an appropriate review by the SGMP before CEP XVI. Further work on this plan was therefore to be concluded by the SGMP during the 2013-14 intersesssional period. In March 2014 it became clear to the SGMP that it would not be possible to finalize the revised maps for the ASPA in due time for an appropriate review by the SGMP before CEP XVII. Further work on this plan was therefore to be postponed.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP advises the CEP that further intersessional work will be conducted with regard to the draft management plan for (ASPA) No. 144 ‘Chile Bay’ (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands.

ASPA 145 Port Foster, Deception Island
A draft revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 145 Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands was in 2012 submitted to CEP XV and referred to the SGMP for review by the Committee.

Further work on this plan was therefore to be postponed.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP advises the CEP that further intersessional work will be conducted with regard to the draft management plan for (ASPA) No. 146 South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago.

    3. Terms of Reference #4 and #5 on improving management plans and the process for their intersessional review
The SGMP work plan for the 2013/14 intersessional period included no specific tasks relating to its Terms of Reference #4 and #5. The SGMP notes that CEP XIV supported the recommendations of the 2011 Workshop on Marine and Terrestrial Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, and encouraged interested Members ‘to review the provisions of existing ASMA management plans, with a view to preparing a suggested work plan and supporting materials to support work by the SGMP to develop guidance for establishing ASMAs and for preparing and reviewing ASMA management plans.’ At CEP XV the Committee agreed to defer the SGMP’s consideration of actions arising from the ASMA workshop due to the heavy work load at hand in the coming intersessional period (para 111). It is suggested that the SGMP during the 2014-15 intersessional period initiates the work on developing guidance for preparing and reviewing ASMA management plans, by inter alia developing a work plan for such a process.  
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP suggest that the CEP request the SGMP to initiate the work to develop guidance for preparing and reviewing ASMA management plans, inter alia by developing a work plan for the process.

Draft Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 141 Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay

    1. The primary reason for the designation of Yukidori Valley, (Lat. 69o14’30S, Long. 39o46’00E), Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) is to protect a fragile, typical continental Antarctic fellfield ecosystem and its component species.  The long-term monitoring programs have been conducted in this ASPA site.
    2. Substantial changes have been made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan, which include:
    1. Introduction. In addition to the Environmental Domains Analysis, Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Region was added. General reason for ASPA designation was also added.
    2. Description of values to be protected.  This section has been revised and values relating to continental Antarctic fellfield ecosystem, and  long-term monitoring have been added.
    3. Management activities.  Some activities have been added including the provision of Management Plan in all facilities in the region, prior instruction to the personnel who operates in the vicinity of the area by the national program, prior notification of the location, boundary and restriction to the pilots operating in the region.
    4. Description of the Area. A general outline of the area has been added.  
    5. Flora and Fauna. In this section, the spreading of vegetation and breeding site of snow petrels along the stream in the area were briefly added.  
    6. Location of structures within and adjacent to the Area. Location of biological research hut was added with coordinates in this section. 
    7. Access to, and movement within or over, the Area. Access by snow vehicle and helicopter including heliport location outside of the Area was added in the map. In addition, aircraft access guidelines have been clarified in line with the ‘Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds’ contained in Resolution 2 (2004).  
    8. Installation, modification or removal of structure. New restrictions have been added including biosecurity requirements not to compromise the values to be protected in the Area, and general guidance on structure installation and removal, etc.
    9. Location of field camps.  The locations of designated field camps outside the Area have been added.
    10. Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area. Guidance have been clarified in line with CEP Non-native species manual (CEP, 2011) and the Environmental code of conduct for terrestrial scientific field research in Antarctica (SCAR, 2009).  
    11. Disposal of waste. The description on the removal of wastes from the area was added.
    12. Measures that may be necessary to continue to meet the aims of the Management Plan. The biosecurity requirements have been updated, including the need to take precautions to prevent the accidental introduction of animals, plant material, micro-organisms and non-sterile soil from other biologically distinct regions. The requirements on persons planning new projects in the Area to avoid interference with long-term research and monitoring activities have also been added.

Appendix 2. Introductory comments by Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation

Proposed new Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) at Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land

Australia, China, India, and the Russian Federation jointly propose the designation of Stornes, a peninsula in the Larsemann Hills, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) under Annex V to the Protocol, primarily to primarily protect the outstanding geological features of the area, specifically the rare mineral occurrences and the highly unusual host rocks in which they occur. This objective is consistent with Article 3.2(f) of Annex V, which provides for ‘examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features’ to be included in the series of ASPAs.

The proposed ASPA is located within Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) 6 Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, which was designated under Measure 2 (2007). The ASMA management plan adopted under Measure 2 (2007) designated Stornes as a Restricted Zone, and noted that consideration would be given to the possible designation of Stornes as an ASPA.

Following a review of the scientific literature, consultation with scientists who have carried out research in the area Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation prepared a draft management plan for a proposal for a new ASPA at Stornes. The draft management plan was presented to CEP XVI (2013) in ATCM XXXVI/WP63 Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Stornes, Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica.

CEP XVI referred the draft management plan to the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) for review during the intersessional period. In response to comments received from the SGMP, Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation refined the draft management plan, including by better describing the significance and vulnerability of the mineral deposits, better  defining the Area boundary, and clarifying the provisions vehicle and helicopter use.  The maps were also revised to show the location of a hut adjacent to the proposed Area, and possible campsites within the Area, and to better illustrate the Area boundary.

The revised draft management plan for the proposed ASPA at Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land is presented for consideration by the CEP.

Appendix 3. Introductory comments by Poland and the United States

Draft Revised Management Plan for
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 128 Western shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands

    1) The Management Plan for ASPA No. 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay was last reviewed and adopted in 2000. A review was initiated in 2012 although a revised Management Plan was not adopted. Accordingly, through international cooperation between Poland and the United States a comprehensive revision of the Management Plan has now been completed. Detailed and constructive comments from the Committee for Environmental Protection have helped strengthen the revised Management Plan proposed.
    2) The primary reasons for designation of the western shore of Admiralty Bay (centered at 58° 27' 40" W, 62° 11' 50" S), King George Island, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) is to protect the diverse avian and mammalian fauna and locally rich vegetation, to protect long term scientific research that has been, and continues to be, conducted within the Area, and to provide a representative example of the maritime Antarctic ecosystem.  
    3) The current Management Plan reaffirms these values of the Area, and has noted several additional values for protection. However, the non-native grass Poa annua has colonized a small site within the Area near Ecology Glacier, and it is recognized that this issue needs attention. 
    4) Major changes have been made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan, the most important of which include:
    1. Comprehensive revisions throughout to achieve consistency with the Committee for Environmental Protection Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (Resolution 2 (2011)), and with new agreements and guidance reached by the ATCM since the previous Management Plan was adopted;
    2. Introduction. An introduction was added to outline key features of the Area, including the reasons for and history of designation, and its classification under the Environmental Domains Analysis for Antarctica and the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions. Introduction of the non-native species Poa annua is identified as a key issue for management.
    3. Section 1 – Description of values to be protected.  This section has been expanded to provide more detail on the vegetation (flowering plants, mosses and lichens) and microbial (algae, invertebrates) values of the Area. New scientific values associated with opportunities for study of colonization processes and monitoring of the introduced species Poa annua have been added.
    4. Section 2 – Aims and objectives.  More explicit definitions of the aims and objectives of the Management Plan are provided.
    5. Section 3 – Management activities.  Expanded to include the full range of management activities needed, and in particular provisions have been added to clarify procedures for management of non-native species.
    6. Section 5 – Maps. New maps have been prepared to provide updates and greater clarity on features present within and nearby to the Area, including revisions to coastlines and glacier boundaries following glacial recession, wildlife breeding sites, the location of introduced species, and facilities. Key access policies that apply within the Area are now shown on the main site map.
    7. Section 6 – Description of the Area. The description of the Area has been comprehensively revised to include a general overview, and information on climate, geology, soils, glaciology, streams and lakes, terrestrial ecology, breeding birds and mammals and human activities. Data on breeding birds and mammals have been brought up to date, and relevant scientific literature has been reviewed and summarized. Substantial changes in the bird populations are particularly noteworthy, although these changes are not attributed to local sources of impact, but rather are consistent with similar changes being observed across the broader Antarctic Peninsula region. Information on the locality and extent of the introduced species Poa annua is provided.
    8. Section 6 – Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features. The boundary has been refined and updated from the improved mapping that is now available. A minor revision to the northern boundary has been made in the north-east to include part of an Adélie penguin colony previously omitted. Coordinates have been revised so they are consistent with the WGS84 datum that has been applied in the revised mapping.
    9. Section 6 (ii) Access to the Area. A new section was added to describe access to the Area, to maintain consistency with other recently adopted management plans.
    10. Section 7 (ii) Access to and movement within the Area. Policies on access to and movement within the Area have been comprehensively revised, with more explicit guidance now provided on access by foot, small boat and by aircraft. Recommended minimum approach distances to wildlife by pedestrians have been added. It is emphasized that pedestrians entering the Area from nearby Arctowski Station should take precautions against the potential transfer of plant material and seeds of the invasive Poa annua. Aircraft access guidelines are now more explicit and consistent with Resolution 2 (2004) ‘Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds’.
    11. Section 7 (iii) Activities that may be conducted within the Area. Several activities that may be conducted within the Area have been added, including educational and outreach activities (provided these cannot be served elsewhere), protecting historic resources, and management of non-native species.
    12. Section 7(iv) Installation, modification or removal of structures / equipment. More explicit guidance is provided on installation of structures and equipment, including on the timing of installation, maintenance and removal.
    13. Section 7 (vi) Restrictions on materials and organisms which can be brought into the Area. These provisions have been expanded and strengthened, including additional precautions to prevent further establishment of Poa annua. Measures to prevent release of poultry products have been added.
    14. Section 7 (viii) Disposal of waste. A minor modification to the wording has been made to clarify how to handle domestic liquid wastes.
    15. Section 8 - Supporting documentation. References cited in the Management Plan have been added.
