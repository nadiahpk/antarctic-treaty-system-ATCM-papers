Continuation of the Intersessional Contact Group 
on Marathons and Large-Scale Sporting Events held in Antarctica


Introduction

The development of tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area has been a matter of continuous concern for the Parties during Consultative Meetings, as evidenced in the measures and resolutions adopted, particularly since 2004. This WP approaches the subject of marathons and large-scale sporting events in Antarctica.

Background

During ATCM XXXII, Chile submitted WP 54 The effect of marathons held on the Antarctic continent, which suggested that the steady increase of these large-scale activities requires appropriate regulation. Chile requested that the ATCM express its views regarding such activities. The ATCM established an Intersessional Contact Group on this issue led by Chile, in order obtain the views from the other countries and submit a document with a draft resolution in the next Consultative Meeting. 

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the ICG were to: 

    • Discuss the management of large-scale sporting events and marathons;
    • Determine the need for additional tourism regulations as mentioned above, particularly tools for specific sites; and
    • In view of Resolution 3 (2004), consider if additional procedures are required regarding the exchange of information and prior notice of such activities among the Parties. 

During ATCM XXXIII, Chile submitted WP 65 Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Marathons and other large – scale Sporting Activities in Antarctica, which informed the countries about the different views held, noting there is a consensus on the need to study the issue and ensure such events comply with the regulations set forth in the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, highlighting the need for the exchange of information and prior notice of such activities. However, it also noted that the results were not conclusive regarding the need for additional measures concerning large-scale sporting activities. In this regard, it was noted that a greater number of Parties should be involved in this matter, in order to move towards the establishment of consensus on this issue. The ATCM acknowledged that the Intersessional Contact Group, led by Chile, should continue its work based on the following terms of reference:

    • Conduct an analysis of the management of marathons and other large-scale sporting events, and collect information on large-scale events already held, or yet to be held, in Antarctica.
    • Review the existing tools and mechanisms used for regulating and managing large-scale sporting events, and study the need for additional mechanisms, such as regulations, specific instruments for certain sites or checklists.
    • In view of Resolution 3 (2004), study if additional procedures are required concerning prior notice and exchange of information among the Parties. Share examples of effective communication and exchange of useful information among the Parties, and provide advice on potential improvements.

During the relevant intersessional period 2010-2011, it was not possible to advance the Group's work and, as a result, the issue has not been discussed in subsequent Consultative Meetings.





Recommendation

Given the strong interest expressed by the countries in developing better controls of large-scale activities and sporting events in Antarctica, and on the other hand, due to the steady increase in such activities over the last few years, it is recommended that the Intersessional Contact Group resume work on this issue and focus on the identification of measures to enable the sustainable development of this kind of activities.
