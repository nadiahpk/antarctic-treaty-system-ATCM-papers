Reviewing information exchange requirements
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
The ATCM’s multi-year strategic work plan, adopted through Decision 5 (2013), identifies a priority item for discussion at ATCM XXXVII on the information exchange requirements and the functioning of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES). In ATCM XXXVII/SP 7 the Secretariat provides comprehensive information which can form the basis for that discussion. Australia proposes a process to structure this discussion to advance this priority, and suggests draft terms of reference for intersessional work should it be required. 
Background
In adopting a multi-year strategic work plan through Decision 5 (2013) at ATCM XXXVI, the Parties included a priority for discussion at ATCM XXXVII, relating to requirements for information exchange, as follows:
Work area
Priority
2013
Intersessional 
2014
Ensuring a robust and effective ATS
Conduct a comprehensive review of existing requirements for information exchange and the functioning of the Electronic Information Exchange System and the identification of any additional requirements.

Secretariat to prepare a summary including the outcome from informal CEP discussions on EIES.
Invite Parties, experts and observers to prepare working and other papers.
Dedicated discussion of this topic in the Legal and Institutional Working Group including presentation by the Secretariat on Electronic Information Exchange System.
Consider updating Resolution 6 (2001).
Establishment of an ICG, if required, to address any unresolved issues.
Consistent with the work plan, the Secretariat has prepared ATCM XXXVII/SP7, which presents a detailed summary of: existing requirements for information exchange; issues raised in previous ATCM and CEP discussions of information exchange; and the functioning of the Electronic Information Exchange System. In Australia’s view this paper is an excellent reference for the planned comprehensive review of existing information exchange requirements and consideration of any additional requirements.
Australia notes that a detailed discussion of information exchange requirements might not be concluded during the time available to the Legal and Institutional working group of ATCM XXXVII. We also note that advice from the CEP may be useful to the Parties in relation to environmental information to be exchanged. Further, we note that some information exchange requirements derive directly from the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and Protocol, and as such are beyond the scope of an ATCM review.
With these points in mind, and in accordance with the work plan’s invitation to Parties, experts and observers to prepare papers, this paper presents suggestions on structuring and sequencing the discussion of this topic.
Proposal
To advance the discussion of this topic, we propose that the ATCM:
    • agree to conduct a comprehensive review of the information exchange requirements;
    • agree that the scope of any review should exclude those information exchange requirements identified in the Treaty and Protocol;
    • defer consideration of the functioning of the EIES until after the Parties have reviewed the information to be exchanged, to ensure that the further development of the EIES can be informed by any outcomes of that review;
    • request the CEP to provide advice on the exchange of information relating to environmental matters; and
    • establish an intersessional contact group to advance the review process (draft terms of reference are presented at Attachment A).
Australia notes the effective work of the Secretariat on matters relating to information exchange and the EIES in recent years, including convening and reporting on the informal contact group on the technical functioning of the EIES following ATCM XXXIV. We propose that the Secretariat be requested to convene the intersessional contact group, should it be agreed by the Parties. Australia has consulted with the Executive Secretary who has indicated that the Secretariat would be able to include this activity in its work plan within the normal operating budget.
    • Attachment A: Draft ICG terms of reference

Drawing as appropriate on the summary provided by the Secretariat in ATCM XXVII/SP7, the ICG will:
    • review the information currently required to be exchanged;
    • consider whether there is a continued value for Parties to exchange information on each item and whether some items need to be modified, updated, differently described, made mandatory (where currently included as optional), or removed;
    • consider the pending issues relating to information exchange listed by the Secretariat in SP7;
    • consider where other information exchange mechanisms (for example those operated by COMNAP) may overlap with current ATCM requirements;
    • consider the timing of information exchange, including where Parties might desire continuous exchange of information rather than annual reporting;
    • consider how each item best fits into the categories of pre-season, annual, and permanent information; and
    • report to ATCM XXXVIII on the outcomes of this work.
