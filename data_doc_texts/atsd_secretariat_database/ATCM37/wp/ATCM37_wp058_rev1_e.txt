Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 171, Narębski Point, Barton Peninsula, King George Island
Summary
The Republic of Korea has conducted the first review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) No. 171, Narębski Point, Barton Peninsula, King George Island. Since only minor amendments are required, the Republic of Korea recommends that the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) approves the attached revised Management Plan.
Background
ASPA No. 171 Narębski Point (62° 13’ 40”S - 62° 14’ 23”S, 58° 45’ 25”W - 58° 47’ 00”W) is located at the Barton Peninsula on King George Island in South Shetland Islands, and the Area was designated as ASPA under Measure 13 (2009), following a proposal by the Republic of Korea. Given its outstanding environmental values and to facilitate ongoing and planned scientific research, the Area should be protected and subject to minimal disturbance by human activities with the exception of occasional monitoring studies including vegetation, bird populations, geological and geomorphologic studies.
The Republic of Korea has conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No. 171, Narębski Point, Barton Peninsula, King George Island, as required under Article 6.3 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. This review was conducted with reference to Annex V and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. 
Summary of amendments
A revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 171 is provided at Attachment A. The amendments are summarized as bellows:
    • Editorial amendments have been made for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA Management Plans and with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011).
    • New information on faunal and floral changes, such as the number of breeding penguins and the list of reported species confirmed through recent monitoring activities, is updated (Section 6(i)).
    • Common and scientific names of birds were reviewed based on the World Bird List (v 4.1; 2014) of the International Ornithologists’ Union (IOC), and changed, if required, to adopt recent taxonomic changes and corrections of nomenclature (Section 6(i)).
    • Maps (including both captions and graphics) are improved. In particular, the location of a refuge facility (established in 2006, about 2 years before the ASPA designation) and its associated access route by boat, which were inaccurately indicated in the previous Management Plan, was corrected as being located in the Area, not in the vicinity of the Area (Section ANNEX II).

Recommendation
The Republic of Korea recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 171, Narębski Point, Barton Peninsula, King George Island (Attachment A).
