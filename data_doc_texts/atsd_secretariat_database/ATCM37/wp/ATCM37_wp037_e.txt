Final Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on the exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty Area




Final report of the Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) on the exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty area
Presented by France

Background
At ATCM XXXV France presented WP 28 titled Jurisdiction in Antarctica which dealt with the complexity of the exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty area and proposed the establishment of an ICG to study the issue1. At ATCM XXXVI WP 44, The exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty area which summarised the work done by the ICG with France as convener was presented.  At the ATCM the Meeting agreed to “continue to consider the exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty area and to extend the mandate of the ICG established at ATCM XXXV mutatis mutandis” (Final Report, paragraph 47). In consequence, the ICG was extended to ATCM XXXVII.
Summary of the ICG discussions
The discussions of the ICG, on the legal framework and the main issues in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction, can be summarised as follows: 
    • To date the ATCM has not adopted any measure dealing with the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica as provided for by Article IX paragraph 1 point (e) of the Treaty. Consequently Article VIII paragraph 2 is to be systematically applied, to uphold the need for cooperation between Parties.
    • As noted by the Parties judicial breaches committed within the Antarctic and the procedures that they entail, so far, have been exceptional occurrences.
    • A majority of Parties have agreed to adopt a case-by-case approach to deal with each potential breach, thereby taking into account the unique legal status of Antarctica and its specific characteristics.  It appears that this is an agreed procedure for the majority of Parties.
    • The Parties wish to maintain the current practice. However they remain very much aware of the importance of the issue of jurisdiction in Antarctica, particularly the question of legal competency, of the gathering of evidence, of the establishment of a legal entity for Antarctica and of the need to exchange information.  Such questions have been the subject of many discussions within the ICG during its meetings in the last two years.  
The preference of the Parties to deal with each situation on a case by case basis and in a spirit of cooperation, in accordance with Article VIII paragraph 2 of the Treaty, has been noted.  As a result France would like to proposed that each Party appoint a single contact point (as well as a replacement contact point) who could be immediately contacted, in case of any problem arising in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica.  
France has also suggested that an informal meeting be held during each ATCM amongst Parties who wish to meet, on a voluntary basis, so as to discuss how to improve the system of exchange of information on any potential breach that may have occurred during any given year. Such an approach would provide to the Parties a much more accurate overview of the number of breaches that have occurred, the problems they entail and any solutions that may have been found to resolve them.
Parties who have contributed to the ICG discussions have made the following observations: 
    • It is vital for Parties to exchange information and data on all possible incidents as well as on their national legislation in order to facilitate the development of a legal entity for Antarctica.
    • The Parties, in majority, have reiterated their preference to resolve all issues concerning the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica through cooperation between the Parties involved, and to deal with any incident in a pragmatic manner, on a case by case basis. As a result, Parties at this point in time do not favour the adoption of specific measures as provided for by Article IX paragraph 1 point (e) of the Treaty.
    • However ASOC is of the opinion that even if the current practice so far has been adequate, it may not be able to respond to any other future requirement particularly the question of competence, of the gathering of evidence, of the establishment of a legal entity for Antarctica and of the need to exchange information. ASOC is concerned about the risk of a negative conflict emerging on the issue of legal competency. ASOC is also concerned about the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica on citizens of countries which are not party to the Treaty.  Consequently ASOC is more in favour of a legislative model being developed.  This model could serve to encourage the Parties to do more work in this area and also could help any non-Consultative Party to accede to the Madrid Protocol.
    • The proposal to instigate an informal contact point in order to deal with any question associated with the issue of jurisdiction has been accepted.  This informal contact point may deal with any breach or challenge to specific laws as well as to the general notions of law applicable in Antarctica.
    • Belgium has suggested that an Information Paper be developed, through the ICG, on how the exercise of national jurisdiction may impact specifically on the installation and the use of new infrastructure, equipment and land transports in Antarctica.
Recommendations
In view of the above, France makes a number of recommendations to the ATCM as follows:
- to take note of the preference expressed by the Parties to deal with each situation on a case by case basis and in a spirit of cooperation, in accordance with Article VIII paragraph 2 of the Treaty; 
- to publish on a password-secured page of the Secretariat’s website a list of all national contact points on the question of the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica (and of their replacement if unavailable) and to request that the Secretariat keep the list updated ; 
- to hold an informal meeting at each ATCM so as to monitor the progress made and the trends in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica (for instance, to survey the number of breaches on record, the number of cases pending, the problems remaining etc.); and 
- to deal with the specific issue of infrastructure development as a distinct and thematic question, in the context of the exercise
