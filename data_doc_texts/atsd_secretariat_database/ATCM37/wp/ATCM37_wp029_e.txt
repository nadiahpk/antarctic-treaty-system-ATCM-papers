Review of the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (the EIA Guidelines) were first adopted in 1999 and last revised in 2005. The CEP has scheduled work to further revise the EIA Guidelines, via an intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) to operate during the 2014/15 intersessional period. Australia has reviewed CEP discussions on the issue of EIA, and related developments, with a view to identifying matters that could be considered by the ICG. Australia also presents possible terms of reference for the ICG.
Background
Article 8 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires that proposed activities be subject to prior environmental impact assessment (EIA), in accordance with procedures outlined in Annex I. The first CEP meeting in 1998 acknowledged the need for guidance to proponents and to those responsible for administering these procedures, and established an intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) to prepare draft guidelines. CEP II (1999) endorsed the resulting Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (the EIA Guidelines), and Resolution 1 (1999) recommended that they be made available for use by those engaged in the preparation of EIAs.
At CEP VII (2004) the Committee established an ICG to suggest modifications to the EIA Guidelines, to take into account the assessment of possible cumulative impacts arising from multiple activities at multiple locations undertaken by one or more national or private operators. At CEP VIII (2005) the Committee endorsed the revised Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica, which were adopted under Resolution 4 (2005).
Since the CEP five-year work plan was adopted at CEP XI (2008) it has included a priority 3 issue relating to ‘Implementing and improving the EIA provisions of Annex I’, and a related action ‘Keep the EIA Guidelines under review’. At CEP XVI (2013) the possible need to revisit the guidelines was raised during discussion of several meeting papers. In response to a suggestion from Australia during discussion of ATCM XXXVI/WP42, submitted by France, the Committee agreed to schedule a review of the EIA Guidelines in its five-year work plan1. Accordingly, the work plan was updated to include the following task for the 2014/2015 intersessional period:
    • ‘Start a revision of the EIA Guidelines, including human footprint, wilderness, decommissioning of stations, etc.’2
Possible matters for consideration in a review of the EIA Guidelines
The following sections briefly highlight issues raised in CEP discussions, and related developments, that would be appropriate to consider in a review of the EIA Guidelines.
Discussions on the possible need to revise the EIA Guidelines
    • Non-native species: The CEP Non-Native Species Manual adopted under Resolution 6 (2011) includes a section on ‘Guidelines and resources requiring further attention or development’, which suggests ‘Revising the EIA guidelines to include a special section on non-native species’. 
    • Decommissioning phase: At CEP XVI (2013) the Committee welcomed the theoretical cost estimate for decommissioning Concordia station, prepared by France and Italy (ATCM XXXVI/WP42), and emphasised the importance of correctly calculating the costs of establishing stations by adopting a life-cycle approach and including the costs of decommissioning. The Committee agreed that such matters should be considered in a review of the EIA Guidelines3.
    • Climate change: The 2010 Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME) on Implications of Climate Change for Antarctic Management and Governance (ATCM XXXIII/WP63) recommended that the CEP consider developing a climate change response work programme, including a review of existing management tools to assess their continuing suitability in a climate change context (e.g. EIA Guidelines, particularly with regard to planned long-term activities) 4. The ATME also recommended that, in developing EIAs for new facilities, Parties be requested to take climate change considerations into account5. These recommendations have been given some consideration in the first round of intersessional discussion led by the United Kingdom and Norway on developing a climate change response work plan.
    • Footprint and wilderness: At CEP XVI (2013) New Zealand presented ATCM XXXVI/WP 35 and ATCM XXXVI/IP39 on the topic of guidance material to assist Parties to take into account wilderness values when undertaking EIAs. New Zealand confirmed that it would aim  to continue work on such guidance, including with a view to contributing to a review of  the EIA guidelines in due course (CEP XVI Final Report, para 167). The Committee noted this issue in its five-year work plan, through the scheduled review of the EIA Guidelines. 
    • Environmental aspects of Antarctic tourism: CEP XIII (2010) considered Australia’s assessment of the environmental aspects and impacts of ship-borne tourism (ATCM XXXIII/WP28) and agreed to consider how the assessment might be appended to the EIA Guidelines6. The assessment was further developed in Table 2 and Table 4 of the 2012 CEP Tourism Study: Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic: Environmental Aspects and Impacts (ATCM XXXV/IP33). The report suggests that ‘Ideally the aspects listed in Table 2 above would be addressed within any environmental impact assessment...’.
CEP procedures and resources for environmental impacts assessment
    • CEP X (2007) adopted Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs. These replaced the Guidelines for CEP Consideration of Draft CEEs, which were adopted at CEP II (1999), and established the practice of convening an ICG to review each draft CEE. The new procedures also encouraged proponents to circulate draft CEEs to the CEP as soon as practicable, reflecting discussion in the Committee on the benefits of early notification of draft CEEs that are in preparation.
    • Resolution 1 (2005) on Environmental Impact Assessment: Circulation of Information recommended that Parties submit to the Secretariat details of the IEEs and CEEs prepared by or submitted to them during the period 1 April to 31 March of the previous year (including a copy of the documents in electronic format where possible).
    • The EIA Database, established and maintained by the Secretariat, provides access to details provided by Parties in accordance with Resolution 1 (2005). The database can be searched by category (IEE/CEE), year, Party, Topic or keyword.
Other CEP guidelines and resources
While it would not be practical to refer to all guidelines and resources that may be of relevance to the EIA process, it could be beneficial to ensure that those preparing EIAs are made generally aware of the availability of such materials, including:
    • Guidelines endorsed by the CEP, as listed in the CEP Handbook;
    • Antarctic Protected Areas Database and list of Site Guidelines for Visitors, maintained by the Secretariat.
    • SCAR databases and other products, such as those described in ATCM XXXV/IP40rev1.
    • COMNAP operational guidelines, manuals and handbooks, available from the COMNAP website.
    • IAATO guidelines and resources, available from the IAATO website.
Matters regularly raised during CEP reviews of draft CEEs
It may be useful to provide further guidance on matters regularly raised in the CEP’s review of draft CEEs, including the need to:
    • take a holistic approach to defining the scope of the proposed activity;
    • consider a range of alternatives, not just related to the location of the activity;
    • clearly describe the factors considered when determining the preferred option;
    • consider opportunities for international cooperation;
    • consider all elements of the environment when describing the initial environmental reference state;
    • clearly identify the methods and criteria used to assess the significance of predicted impacts;
    • consider the decommissioning phase, and describe what will be left behind;
    • ensure that, where appropriate, detailed consideration is given to: arrangements for fuel storage handling and spill response; measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species; use of renewable energy systems; waste management arrangements;
    • provide direction to and/or summarise procedures cited (e.g. waste management plan); and
    • closely reflect the language of Annex I when stating conclusions, and provide a clear statement of why the project is justifiable.
Terms of reference for an ICG to review the EIA Guidelines
The Committee may wish to consider the following possible terms of reference when establishing an ICG to start a review of the EIA Guidelines during the 2014/15 intersessional period: 
    1) Consider whether the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment appended to Resolution 1 (2005) should be modified to address the issues identified above, and other matters agreed by the Committee during CEP XVII.
    2) As appropriate, suggest modifications to the EIA Guidelines.
    3) Report to CEP XVIII.
Recommendation
Australia recommends that the CEP:
    1) considers the issues summarised in this paper, which might usefully be considered in a review and revision of the EIA Guidelines; and
    2) considers the proposed terms of reference for an ICG to start a review of the EIA Guidelines during the 2014/15 intersessional period.
