On the Issue of Commercial Tour Vessels Navigating under a Third-party Flag in the Antarctic Treaty Area
Working paper presented by France
Summary
The growth of tourism in Antarctica is a trend likely to pose a challenge to navigational safety, given that some commercial tour vessels have a significant load capacity (up to 2449 passengers, according to the data available from the EIES) and given that some of the vessels may also operate under the flag of a Third-party State, that is a State not Party to the Antarctic Treaty System. In this document France has attempted to reach a better understanding of the upward trend and likely impact of the increasing presence of commercial tour vessels under a Third-party flag, using the data available from the EIES.  The data indicates that 63% of commercial tour vessels carrying more than 50 passengers operate under a Third-party flag. The proposal from France is that an ICG be formed in order to provide further analysis and make recommendations regarding the presence in Antarctica of vessels operating under a Third-party flag. This is particularly important in view of the need to ensure optimal navigational safety in the ATS area, and also so as to minimise the risks to human lives, and to the environment, in case of any shipping accident. France further suggests to seek the support and cooperation of IAATO, and that the EIES be improved so as to make the data on the status of the Flag State, for each vessel, more readily accessible to the Parties.    
Background
In 2007 the MS Explorer incident brought to attention the presence in Antarctica of vessels with a high load capacity and operating under the flag of a Third-party State non party to the Treaty. As a result of the continuous growth of commercial tourism in Antarctica, the issue arises as to how to accurately ensure and monitor the commercial tour vessels operating under a Third-party flag in the area of the Treaty and their navigational safety, since they come to the Treaty area under the strict responsibility and control of the Flag State.1 A preliminary analysis of the data currently available from the EIES has yielded the following results:
    1. From an analysis of the EIES data for the 2013/2014 tourist preseason, it is clear that there is a significant proportion of commercial tour vessels under a Third-party flag operating in Antarctica with either a high or a medium load capacity. 
According to the EIES data for the 2013/2014 tourist preseason, 712 vessels in total have been authorised to operate in the area of the Treaty. Their distribution in terms of load capacity is as follows: 
- 44 have a load capacity of less than 50 passengers (on average 8 passengers) and in consequence they can be classified as yachts that have been chartered either by individuals or by a small tourist operator.  We have designated these vessels below as being “of low load capacity”.
- 27 have a load capacity of more than 50 passengers (on average 349 passengers) and in consequence they can be classified as vessels of high or medium load capacity3.
In terms of navigational safety requirements and of environmental impacts, particularly in case of any accident, the consequences of any mishap among the high or medium load vessels could be dire, due to the large size of most of these vessels and their extensive passenger capacity. In fact, of the 44 vessels described above as being “of low load capacity” only a very small proportion operate under a Third-party flag (less than 5%), whereas for the remainder of the vessels (27) the inverse is the case: a very significant number of those vessels of high or medium load capacity (17) operate under a Third-party flag (63%).

    • As can be seen from Figure 1, low load capacity vessels in their vast majority operate under the flag of a State Party to the Antarctic Treaty. Only 2 out of the 44 vessels, or less than 5%, operate under a Third-party flag.

    • High to medium load capacity vessels, on the other hand, frequently operate under the flag of a non-Party State. Of the 27 vessels thus described, 17 or 63% operate under a Third-party flag. If this figure is converted to the actual number of trips or visits made in the Treaty area by these vessels (175 trips), the percentage of trips or visits made into Antarctica by vessels operating under a Third-party flag is even higher, 65%.

    • As can be seen from the above figure, Third-party Flag States in 2013/2014 are as follows: the Bahamas, with 13 registered vessels, the Marshall Islands (2), Malta (1) and Cyprus (1). 
The number of commercial tour vessels of a high/medium load capacity operating under a Third-party flag is likely to increase, and as a result a greater risk may occur to human lives, and to the environment, in case of any shipping accident. As navigational safety is the responsibility of the Flag State, for those states that are not Party to the Antarctic Treaty their control over vessels bearing their flag can be exercised strictly, or perhaps not so strictly. 

2. Development of discussions on the issue of commercial tour vessels operating under a Third-party flag 
A further discussion of the issue, within an ICG, appears to us to be a valid and useful initiative, all the more so because of the forthcoming adoption of the Polar Code (planned for the end of 2014) and of its subsequent implementation in 2015 or 2016. The proposed ICG could be tasked with analysing and assessing the trends in regard to commercial tour vessels operating under a Third-party flag inside the area of the Treaty, and also with evaluating the risks associated with their operation, particularly in regard to the current rules to ensure the safety of navigation and the protection of the environment in Antarctica.   
    • To this end, the functionality of the EIES could be improved, so as to allow Parties to have more rapid access to the data on commercial tour vessels operating under a Third-party flag in the area of the Treaty. Whereas the EIES data is fully available on Flag States and on the list of vessels authorised to operate in the area of the Treaty, the EIES interface does not yet provide any overview on the presence of Third-party flags and does not yet permit any breakdown or synthesis of that data.  The proposal made by France therefore is to add to the EIES a new functionality that would provide a rapid summary of the data regarding the Flag States according to their different status (that is, States Party to the Antarctic Treaty on the one hand, and States non-Party to the Antarctic Treaty on the other hand).  This information could then be correlated with the number of vessels and their load capacity, to reveal the proportion among all vessels of those operating under a Third-party flag; and also the information could be correlated with the number of trips or visits made by these same vessels, to provide an accurate and reliable assessment of their presence in the area of the Treaty. 
    • France would also like to suggest that IAATO be invited to broaden its online statistical database, with regular and updated information being made readily available online by IAATO on the Flag States of all IAATO-affiliated vessels4.
    • It is worth noting, however, that the analysis being sought for in this document will never be complete, by definition. The data from the EIES relates only to commercial tour vessels that have been duly authorised, by the national authorities of the relevant Parties, to operate in the area of the Treaty. In France’s view, useful discussions could be held in the proposed ICG on how to also collect data on non-authorised vessels.  



Recommendations to the ATCM 
France’s proposal is for the following recommendations to be made to the ATCM:
-	that an Intersessional Contact Group be formed in order to further analyse and discuss the presence in Antarctica of vessels operating under a Third-party flag, and also to reflect on the need for any new measures to be adopted in the future if necessary in view of the risks such vessels may present to navigational safety, the security of visitors, and the protection of the environment in the case of a shipping accident. France is willing to act as the convener of the proposed ICG, and to report on its intersessional deliberations and its conclusions at ATCM XXXVIII:  
-	that IAATO be closely associated with this initiative, so that any data collected on the issue can be made available to all IAATO-affiliated tour operators; and 
-	that a new functionality be introduced into the EIES so as to allow the regular and rapid correlation and synthesis of data specifically on the presence of vessels operating under Third-party flags.
