Framework for future discussions on experiences and challenges identified by competent authorities with regard to diverse types of tourism and nongovernmental activities
Working Paper submitted by Norway


(Adventure) tourism and non-governmental activities have been an issue discussed by the Parties over a number of years now. A separate Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts was held on the topic in Norway in 2004. Discussions have continued since then. At ATCM XXXVI the Parties had a wide ranging discussion on various aspects of issues related to the diversification of tourism, of which some issues related to the role of competent authorities. The discussion showed that there was a need to focus and prepare for these discussions in a systemized manner. On this basis the Meeting welcomed Norway’s proposal to facilitate intersessional preparations for a discussion on experiences and challenges identified by competent authorities with regard to diverse types of tourism and nongovernmental activities next year (para 238 of the final report from ATCM XXXVI).

Due to ia. the changes of the dates of the meeting Norway has had less time to prepare for this work than anticipated. It is furthermore assumed that the changes in dates have affected Parties ability to prepare for substantial discussions on all elements of this issue.

On this basis Norway suggests that the below framework is discussed at ATCM XXXVII in order to have common framework for preparations to and discussions at ATCM XXXVIII (Bulgaria).
Our aim is that this discussion would result in concrete advice that may guide competent authorities in their consideration of issues related to diverse types of tourism and non-governmental activities and improve consistency between competent authorities in implementing Protocol provisions as well as other relevant recommendations and measures adopted by the ATCM .

Norway suggests that these discussions take place under the auspices of the Tourism Working Group at ATCM XXXVIII. However, the Parties might want to consider whether there could be merit in holding a separate session within the ATCM  dedicated to these discussions, along the line of the SAR Workshop held during the ATCM in Brussels (2013). Such an approach could enable Parties to bring in relevant competent authority people to the dedicated session, and thereby strengthen the basis for the discussions.  The meeting might also want to consider whether some of these issue (in particular those that are focused on clear domestic experiences) are better discussed in a separate meeting between competent authorities, in which case consideration should be given as to how to enable such a meeting/workshop to take place. Norway is prepared to lead intersessional work to further develop the below draft framework should this be the desire of the Meeting. 

Norway notes also the relevance of this topic against the ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Decision 5 (2013)) in which Parties, Observers and Experts are encouraged to prepare and submit working and other papers on land-based and adventure tourism in the intersessional period leading up to ATCM XXXVII towards the priority area identified for the Tourism Working Group’s consideration. 



Issues of overarching nature 
    1. Have Parties’ competent authorities encountered challenges/issues considering of activities in light of the purpose and principles of the Protocol and other relevant ATCM recommendations? In this context the following may be relevant to consider:

    • Instances where “forum shopping” has been a concern
        ◦ Note for example report from ATCM XXXVI (para 231) where the following is reported: The Netherlands stated that differences in legal systems may provide differing implementations of the Environmental Protocol, which could lead to proponents “forum shopping” in various jurisdictions]
    • Other?

    5. Have Parties’ competent authorities encountered issues/challenges of wider implication/interest in handling activities where various elements of the activity has been handled/approved/permitted by different authorities? In this context the following may be relevant to consider:

        ◦ activities involving race type activities 
        ◦ activities involving overwintering expeditions
        ◦ activities involving (coastal) camping
            ▪ Note for example report from ATCM XXXVI (para 228) where the following is reported: On the matter of land-based and adventure tourism, the United States suggested that tourism and non-governmental camping activities would require more exchange between Parties on managing this activity, including best practices, and that the United States would consult with other Parties intersessionally on this topic]

        ◦ Note for example conclusion from ATME (2004) where the establishment of an electronic database on tourism and non-governmental activities was suggested as a potential tool.

    • SAR insurance for sailing expeditions vs. SAR obligations in sea/vessel conventions  
    • Other?
Issues related to cooperation between Parties
    10. Have Parties’ competent authorities encountered issues/challenges of wider implication/interest in sharing of information & cooperation between competent authorities?
        ◦ Note for example report from ATCM XXXVI (para 229) where the following is reported: The United States and the United Kingdom highlighted that the level of cooperation between competent authorities was worth further consideration.]
        ◦ Note for example conclusion from ATME (2004) where liaison and co-operation among Parties with regard to adventure tourism - exchange information about planned expeditions as and when they are notified are highlighted as needs.
