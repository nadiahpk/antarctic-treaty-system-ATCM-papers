Improvements to the Antarctic Environmental Impact Assessment process

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The CEP has prioritised the revision of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Guidelines in its Five Year Work Plan, with an intersessional contact group (ICG) in 2014-15. This paper offers a number of possible policy and process issues for discussion. It also encourages Parties to consider the further development of EIA requirements and procedures and other mechanisms that might improve the EIA process.
Background
The EIA process is mandated by Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which states that ‘The environmental impacts of proposed activities referred to in Article 8 of the Protocol, shall, before their commencement, be considered in accordance with appropriate national procedures’.

Guidelines for the completion of the EIA process in Antarctica, ‘Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica’, were last updated via Resolution 4 (2005). At ATCM XXXVI (Brussels) the CEP updated the CEP Five Year Work Plan and indicated the intention to initiate a revision of the EIA Guidelines during the intersessional period 2014-15.  
EIA review: areas for discussion
The UK supports the revision of the EIA Guidelines and suggests that the CEP consider how the following issues might be incorporated. The United Kingdom recognises that some of these suggestions may be more substantive than can be accommodated in the Guidelines revision and invites discussion on whether the use of other Treaty mechanisms may be required. 

    • consideration of the most appropriate mitigation measures (e.g., whether the ‘Best Practicable Environmental’ option or ‘Best Available Technology’ option has been selected);  
    • assessment of actual or predicted cumulative impacts (e.g., has the proponent consulted other Parties operating within the same geographic area and gained an indication of future plans?  Is there scope for several Parties to undertake a joint-EIA for a geographic area?);
    • consideration of clean-up or remedial requirements at the end of a project or the operational lifetime of a facility (e.g. as suggested in ATCMXXXVI WP42 submitted by France and Italy in relation to Concordia Station);
    • recommendations made by the Climate Change ICG (ATCM XXXVII WP008 submitted by Norway and the United Kingdom) (e.g., (i) ensuring proposed long-term facilities are suitably resilient to climate change and (ii) considering the impact of the proposed activity on the climate, i.e. the green house gas emissions associated with the proposed activity);  
    • appropriate recommendations from the CEP Non-native Species Manual (Resolution 6 (2011);
    • wider consideration of human footprint and wilderness issues (e.g. ATCM XXVI WP035 submitted by New Zealand); and
    • consideration of the usefulness of identifying and providing more detailed guidance on the kinds of ‘trigger points’ which may indicate the need to carry out a subsequent EIA, once the main EIA has been completed and in place. Such points could include: a change in the size of a facility; a change of primary use; changes in logistical support arrangements; or the subsequent establishment of nearby facilities or protected areas.  

This list is not exhaustive. The United Kingdom recognises that other Members will have additional suggestions, and welcomes wider discussion on the scope of such a revision and suggested outcomes.
EIA process: strengthening outcomes
In addition to considering how the policy issues outlined above could be included, the United Kingdom suggests that the CEP also consider other ways of strengthening the EIA process itself. These could include:

    • improved transparency on any conditions associated with any national authorisation to proceed with the assessed activity, to enable greater visibility on how Parties respond to such conditions;
    • improved auditing of a project, including considering joint work with other Parties to review compliance with the EIA;
    • considering whether there is the possibility or need to create an appropriate and effective method within the Treaty System of preventing an environmentally-damaging project proceeding (e.g., a project with ineffective mitigation/preventative measures); 
    • developing an effective process for evaluating science benefit against environmental degradation; and
    • adopting lessons learnt from other EIA regimes (e.g., the best EIA practice in Parties’ domestic legislation).
Recommendations
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP:

    1. takes into account the issues highlighted in this paper during the revision of the EIA Guidelines; and 

    2. considers further development of EIA requirements and procedures and any other mechanism that might improve the EIA process, to ensure that it remains an effective and practical tool to minimise environmental impact.
