The concept of "outstanding values" in the marine environment under Annex V of the Protocol









The concept of "outstanding values" in the marine environment under Annex V of the Protocol
Working Paper submitted by Belgium and France
Summary
This Working Paper contends that there is a need for Parties to develop a more coherent approach to the implementation of Annex V, Article 3 in order to account for the impact of land-based activities and associated logistic support on the marine environment. As a first step, this Working Paper discusses the concept of "outstanding values" as they apply to the marine environment where activities regulated by the ATCM and CEP take place, and suggests the formation of an intersessional contact group to discuss the implementation of Annex V Art. 3 to facilitate the examination of this issue further by the CEP.

    1. Background
Annex V, Art. 3 (1) establishes that any area, including any marine area, may be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area to protect outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values, or ongoing or planned scientific research. 
Annex V, Art. 3 (2) establishes that Parties shall seek to identify, within a systematic environmental-geographical framework, and to include in the series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, nine categories of areas:
    (a) areas kept inviolate from human interference so that future comparisons may be possible with localities that have been affected by human activities; 
    (b) representative examples of major terrestrial, including glacial and aquatic, ecosystems and marine ecosystems; 
    (c) areas with important or unusual assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native birds or mammals; 
    (d) the type locality or only known habitat of any species; 
    (e) areas of particular interest to ongoing or planned scientific research; 
    (f) examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features; 
    (g) areas of outstanding aesthetic and wilderness value; 
    (h) sites or monuments of recognised historic value; and 
    (i) such other areas as may be appropriate to protect the values set out in paragraph 1 above.

Since the entry into force of Annex V in 1998 the CEP has had a number of conceptual discussions on Protected Areas, including the two Protected Area workshops in 1998 and 1999 and the joint CEP - SC CAMLR workshop in 2009, and has developed considerable experience in establishing a series of ASPAs.  Currently, most ASPAs are either located inland or are located in coastal areas but exclude the marine environment.  Comparatively fewer ASPAs containing a marine component have been adopted by the ATCM, following prior approval by CCAMLR in accordance to Decision 9 (2005).  It should be noted that at this point a geographic-environmental framework is better developed for the Antarctic continent that for the Southern Ocean.
Notwithstanding these developments, it is apparent that human activities related to the Antarctic continent (primarily research and associated logistic support, tourism, bioprospecting, and shipping and other logistic support associated with these activities), and generally activities covered by Art. 3 (4) of the Protocol, could also have substantial impacts on the marine environment, mainly on coastal areas but also in open waters. The potential of these activities to have a detrimental impact on the marine environment has been borne by facts including the sinking of resupply and tourism vessels,1, vessel groundings involving fuel spillage,2 and occurrences of fuel spills on land-based facilities reaching coastal waters.3, This issue has been recognized by the ATCM in a number of instruments, notably Annex IV and VI of the Protocol, and a range of other ATCM instruments on marine issues including, inter alia, on marine pollution and environmental protection.  
It is contended here that there is a need for Parties to develop a more coherent approach to the implementation of Annex V, Article 3 in order to account for the impact of land-based activities and associated logistic support on the marine environment. Parties need more information about how various Antarctic activities (other than any harvesting and associated activities, which are not discussed here) may impact on the marine environment, including through suitable monitoring and reporting.  It should be stressed that this argument is without prejudice to the activities regulated by CCAMLR, and without interference with CCAMLR's ongoing processes of developing of marine protected areas - which would not normally cover most of the activities discussed here - or with possible future interactions between that regime and Protected Areas designated under Annex V of the Protocol.4  

As a first step, this Working Paper discusses the concept of "outstanding values" as they apply to the marine environment where activities regulated by the ATCM and CEP take place, and suggests a way forward to facilitate the examination of this issue further by the CEP.
    2. Identifying "outstanding values" in the marine environment under Annex V of the Protocol
The Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol  (Resolution 1, 2000) 5 aim to assist the Parties, SCAR, CCAMLR, COMNAP and the CEP to apply Article 3 of Annex V of the Environmental Protocol for the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. The guidelines provide a set of tools to enable more systematic assessment, selection, definition and proposal of areas that might require greater protection in accordance with the provisions of Annex V of the Environmental Protocol. In general terms, the guidelines aim to facilitate methodical assessment and designation of such areas, but do not focus on the identification of specific areas that meet the Guidelines' criteria. 

The Guidelines state that when seeking to assess whether an area merits protection, a clear understanding is needed of the values to be protected. Values are generally taken to mean something of worth, merit or importance.   Table 1 of the Guidelines contains a checklist of the values listed in Annex V Article 3 (2) that could be used to help identify those values represented in possible specially protected areas.  That table has been expanded here with illustrative examples of marine features/values, and potential activities/impact sources on those values. 
 
    3. Evaluation
Table 1 illustrates the types of outstanding marine values that could be impacted as a result of activities on land and that involve fully or partly a marine component. In fact, a substantial percentage of Antarctic activities do. Only the ASPAs that include a marine component adopted by the ATCM (in accordance to Decision 9 (2005), which are currently eleven,6 provide a degree of protection for some of the values listed in Table 1.  A detailed review of these ASPAs is beyond the scope of this paper, however a summary assessment suggests as follows:

    • Not all values listed under Annex V Art. 3 (2) are equally represented in those ASPAs, with values (b) and (e) and to a lesser extent (c) being substantially more represented than most other values (Table 2), 
    • Some ASPAs are representative of a greater range of values than others (Table 2).
    • The 11 ASPAs represent less than 20% of all ASPAs that have a marine and/or coastal component; 
    • The combined surfaces of the 11 ASPAs, including both terrestrial/coastal and marine components, is estimated as less than 2,000km2.

Consequently, to the extent that these 11 ASPAs afford protection to a number of "outstanding values" in marine areas in accordance to Annex V, Art. 3 (2), their coverage is focused on a limited range of values and of comparatively small scale.
 
It is apparent that this is a topic of concern for the CEP and that further consideration of these matters is necessary. While many of the activities outlined earlier and their resulting impacts are covered by different elements of the Protocol or other ATCM instruments, they are less frequently covered by Annex V instruments, particularly in what concerns the implementation of Annex V 3 (2).  It should be noted that whilst this Working Paper focuses on ASPAs, ASMAs are also relevant to address marine protection for the use categories identified here.7
    4. Recommendation to the CEP
That the CEP endorses the formation of an intersessional contact group to discuss the implementation of Annex V Art. 3 in what respects the concept of "outstanding values" applied to the marine environment in terms of potential threats to that environment from activities covered by Art. 3 (4) of the Protocol.

Such work could include, amongst other matters:

    1. Identifying key "outstanding values" of the marine environment that may be affected by activities linking both the terrestrial and marine environment i.e. research, biological prospecting, tourism, and associated shipping.
    2. Identifying criteria by which marine areas with "outstanding values" would require protection through the ASPA instrument.  
    3. Understanding the work done by CCAMLR on systematic conservation planning as part of its own separate work on marine spatial protection, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and to use, as appropriate, in the CEP's conservation planning.  
    4. Discussing whether there is a need to develop further a systematic environmental-geographical framework for the marine environment (similar to the one being developed for the terrestrial environment), or alternative ways for the CEP to advance a series of ASPAs inclusive of "outstanding values" of the marine environment, with reference to implementing Annex V Art. 3.
