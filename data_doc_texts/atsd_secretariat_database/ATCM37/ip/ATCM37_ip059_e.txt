National Antarctic Programme use of locations with Visitor Site Guidelines in 2013-14

Information Paper presented by the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia and the United States
Summary
This paper provides an overview of information provided by Parties on visits by their National Antarctic Programme (NAP) personnel of locations with ATCM Site Guidelines in place, during the 2013-14 season. 
Background
CEPXVI (Final Report, paragraph 153) endorsed Recommendation 1 of ATCMXXXVI/WP15 Policy Issues Arising from the 2013 On-Site Review of Guidelines for Visitor Sites in the Antarctic Peninsula, which resulted from a multi-party review visit, that Parties continue to make efforts to ensure that all visitors to sites covered by ATCM Site Guidelines are aware, and make use of, the Guidelines.  The CEP also noted that this should include recreational visits by NAP personnel as well as visitors participating in private or non-commercial activity.  The ATCM noted the CEP’s endorsement of this recommendation (ATCM XXXVI Final Report, paragraph 136).

In considering Recommendation 2 of ATCMXXXVI/WP15 (which was for the CEP to consider the value of a survey to establish the level of recreational visits from NAP staff to sites with Site Guidelines in place),   the CEP encouraged members to bring forward information on recreational visits to sites subject to site guidelines, by NAP personnel.  The United Kingdom offered to coordinate an informal process to seek and collate information for reporting to CEP XVII (CEPXVI Final Report, paragraph 153). 

The United Kingdom commissioned information from all CEP contacts about NAP visits to sites covered by Site Guidelines during the intersessional period.  13 Members responded. Six reported that members of their NAPs had visited sites with Site Guidelines, while seven respondents reported no visits of their NAPs. We encourage the remaining 22 CEP contacts to provide similar information, either positive or negative, regarding visits to sites covered by Site Guidelines by their NAPs. This will allow us to compile a complete picture, which will aid the CEP in its consideration of human impact at frequently visited sites and the effectiveness of Site Guidelines.  Details of these activities are provided at Annex A.
