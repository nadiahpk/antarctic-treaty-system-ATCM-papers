SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE

Krill resources

5.	In 2012/13, five Members harvested 217 000 tonnes of krill from Subareas 48.1 (154 000 tonnes), 48.2 (31 000 tonnes) and 48.3 (32 000 tonnes)2. In comparison, the total reported catch of krill in 2011/12 was 161 000 tonnes taken from Subareas 48.1 (76 000 tonnes), 48.2 (29 000 tonnes) and 48.3 (56 000 tonnes) (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, Table 2). 
6.	Notifications for krill fishing in 2013/14 were received from six Members and 19 vessels all in Area 48 (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, paragraph 3.3); there were no notifications for exploratory krill fisheries. 

7.	The Commission noted the Scientific Committee’s re-evaluation of the work plan and timescale of implementation of a feedback management process for management of the krill fishery.  It welcomed the establishment of new CEMP sites by Poland and the Ukraine and the collaboration with krill fishing industry regarding the collection of acoustic data and ecological research on commercial vessels.

Finfish resources

8.	In 2012/13, 11 Members fished for toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and/or D. mawsoni) in Subareas 48.3, 48.4, 48.6, 58.6, 58.7, 88.1 and 88.2 and Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2, 58.4.3a, 58.5.1 and 58.5.2; Members also conducted research fishing for Dissostichus spp. in Subarea 48.5 and Division 58.4.4b. The reported total catch of Dissostichus spp. was 12 900. In comparison, the total reported catch of toothfish in 2011/12 was 14 702 tonnes (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, Table 2). The Commission noted that during 2013 the Secretariat had closed toothfish fisheries in Subareas 48.4N, 88.1 and 88.2 as catch limits were reached.
9.	The Commission noted the occurrence of catches of D. eleginoides from outside the Convention Area, including regions outside EEZs, reported by Members through the CDS, (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, Table 3).
10.	In 2012/13, two Members targeted icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in Subarea 48.3 and one Member targeted icefish in Division 58.5.2; this species was also reported as by-catch in the krill fishery. The reported total catch of C. gunnari was 2 000 tonnes; in comparison, the total reported catch of icefish in 2011/12 was 1 011 tonnes (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, Table 1). 

Exploratory fisheries

11.	Seven Members submitted notifications for exploratory fisheries in Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2 and 58.4.3a and Subareas 48.6, 88.1 and 88.2 (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, paragraph 3.145). Four Members submitted notifications to conduct research fishing for the closed areas in Divisions 58.4.4a and 58.4.4b, and Subareas 48.2 and 48.5. No new fisheries were notified for 2013/14. These notifications were endorsed by the Commission, with revised catch limits set out in the Conservation Measures adopted at CCAMLR-XXXII (http://www.ccamlr.org/en/document/publications/schedule-conservation-measures-force-2013/14)

Fish and invertebrate by-catch

11. 	The Scientific Committee’s recommendations in relation to by-catch issues included the need to examine finfish by-catch across the krill fishing fleet for vessels using all trawl gears and the development of a risk-based sustainable management approach for the impact of toothfish fisheries on skates.

Assessment and avoidance of incidental mortality

12. 	The Commission noted the Scientific Committee’s general advice on incidental mortality of seabirds and marine mammals (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, paragraphs 4.1 and 4.4), in particular the total extrapolated mortalities of seabirds within the Convention Area which totalled 141 (the lowest reported to date). 

Bottom fishing and vulnerable marine ecosystems 

13.	The Commission noted that: 
(i) 	no VMEs were added to the VME registry during 2013. There are currently forty-six VMEs in the registry: Subareas 48.1 (22 VMEs), 48.2 (13 VMEs) and 88.1 (9 VMEs), and Division 58.4.1 (2 VMEs). These VMEs were observed using in situ photography and benthic sampling.
(ii)	there were five notifications of encounters with potential VMEs during exploratory bottom fisheries in 2012/13 with one new VME risk-area declared in Subarea 88.1 in 2013 (SC-CAMLR-XXXII, Annex 6, paragraph 7.13; CCAMLR-XXXII/BG/06 Rev. 1), and a total of 64 VME risk-areas closed to fishing since the introduction of this conservation measure in 2008/09.
Marine Protected Areas 

14.	The Commission noted the progress towards a representative system of MPAs within the Convention Area in relation to Domain 1 (Western Antarctic Peninsula–South Scotia Arc), preparatory work in Domains 3 (Weddell Sea) and the southern part of Domain 4 (Bouvet–Maud) up to 20°E. The Commission welcomed the proposal for an international workshop in April 2014 in Bremerhaven, Germany, to progress the scientific work on a Weddell Sea MPA. The Commission also noted that Norway has undertaken preliminary discussions about the potential for an MPA planning process around Bouvet Island (southern part of Domain 4.
15.	The Commission noted the consideration by the Scientific Committee of Antarctic specially managed areas (ASMAs) and Antarctic specially protected areas (ASPAs) in the Convention Area and agreed that the provision of advice from CCAMLR to the ATCM, in order that such advice could be included in decision-making, was consistent with the spirit of cooperation and harmonisation between CCAMLR and the ATCM. 
Climate change 

16.	The Commission requested that it be prioritised in the agenda of next year’s meeting.
Administrative matters 

17.	Dr Anna Panasiuk-Chodnicka, from the University of Gdańsk, Poland, was selected to receive a CCAMLR Scholarship in 2013.  She is the fourth recipient of the Scholarship.  The previous recipients are from Chile, Argentina and China.

SCHEME OF INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION

18.	The Commission noted that SISO was reviewed in 2013 and that detailed consideration of the outcomes of the review would be considered intersessionally and reported to its meeting in 2014. 

CONSERVATION MEASURES

Proposals for MPAs and special areas

19.	Building on discussions that occurred at the Special Meeting of the Commission at Bremerhaven, Germany, 11-16 July 2013, Australia, France and the EU introduced a revised proposal to establish a representative system of MPAs in the East Antarctica Planning Domain (EARSMPA; CCAMLR-XXXII/34 Rev. 1) and New Zealand and the USA introduced a revised proposal for the establishment of a Ross Sea Region MPA (CCAMLR-XXXII/27).  CCAMLR-XXXII considered a broad range of issues associated with both proposals including:
    • Pre-ambular text
    • Boundaries and area
    • Duration and review periods
    • Provisions for fishing and other activities
    • Research and monitoring arrangements, and
    • Relationship to the General Framework for the establishment of CCAMLR MPAs.

20.	The Commission was unable to reach consensus for the implementation of either of the two MPA proposals.

Licensing and inspection obligations of Contracting Parties
21.	The Commission endorsed SCIC’s advice to revise CM 10-02 to improve the licensing and inspection obligations of Contracting Parties with regard to their vessels operating in the Convention Area and agreed that IMO numbers should be mandatory for all vessels operating in the Convention Area. 
22. 	Following discussions that occurred in the Search and Rescue Working Group established by ATCM-XXXV, the Commission agreed to require the provision of vessel communication details to facilitate the use of CCAMLR’s VMS in support of search and rescue operations in the Convention Area and for a MoU to be developed between CCAMLR and Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres to facilitate these efforts.

Port inspection of fishing vessels

23.	The Commission endorsed SCIC’s advice to amend CM 10-03 to require the mandatory provision of port inspection reports to the Flag State of the vessel inspected.


General fishery matters
Notifications
25.	The Commission revised the requirements for the notification of krill fisheries to provide more detailed information on krill processing and the configuration of nets and mammal exclusion devices used on board vessels (Annex 21-03/A) and further strengthened the reporting requirement for the estimation of the green weight of krill caught (Annex 21-03/B). The requirements for notification were also extended to include information on the collection of acoustic data (SC-CAMLR-XXX, paragraph 2.10). 
26. 	The Commission adopted conservation measures concerning fishing seasons, closed areas, prohibition of fishing, by-catch limits, catch limits, research requirements in relation to data poor exploratory fisheries and managing fishing activity in the event inaccessibility due to ice cover for CCAMLR-managed fisheries for Patagonian toothfish (D. eleginoides), Antarctic toothfish (D. mawsoni) and icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). 

27. 	Conservation measures and resolutions adopted at CCAMLR-XXXII have been published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2013/14 http://www.ccamlr.org/en/conservation-and-management/conservation-measures
