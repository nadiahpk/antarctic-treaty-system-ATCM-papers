Observation record of two species of non-native birds on 25 de
Mayo island, South Shetland Islands
Information Paper presented by Argentina
Background
Several bird species that are prevalent in the southern region of
South America have been recorded as vagrants in the Antarctic
Peninsula region. These include White-rumped Sandpiper Calidris
fuscicollis, which was observed in Livingston, Nelson and 25 de
Mayo islands, South Shetland Islands (Gajardo & Yañez , 1982;
Bannasch et al, 1984; Bannasch , 1984, Trivelpiece et al, 1987 ;
Lange & Naumann, 1990, Silva et al, 1995) and the Hudsonian
Godwit (Limosa haemastica), recorded at the 25 de Mayo island
(Juáres et al 2010). On several occasions it has been reported the
presence of black-necked swans (Cygnus melancorhyphus) in the
South Shetland Islands and other locations in the Antarctic
Peninsula (Lazo & Yañez, 1989, Parmelee & Fraser, 1989; Lange &
Naumann , 1990; Favero et al. , 1991; . Silva et al 1995) as well as
Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) in the South Orkney Islands (Rootes ,
1988) and South Shetland Islands (Trivelpiece et al, 1987 ; Lange &
Naumann , 1990; Favero et al, 1991; Silva et al, 1995). The
presence of these migratory birds has been generally associated
with storms or droughts, which affect or modify the usual migration
routes (Orgeira & Fogliatto, 1991; Favero & Silva, 1998).
New record of non-native species on 25 de Mayo island
On October 15, 2013, a group of scientists that was developing
research tasks in the surrounding areas of Carlini Station (62 ° 14 'S,
58 ° 40' W), observed a flock of 18 individuals of Rosy-billed
Pochard (Netta peposaca) of both sexes. The birds were in an ice-
free area about 10 m from the coast, near a body of fresh water.
Between 16 and 21 October a total of 7 individuals of that species
(5 males and 2 females) was recorded. In addition, between 18 and
22 October, 2 males of  Chiloe Wigeon (Anas sibilatrix) at the same
location were observed. During the observations, the scientific staff
collected two dead males of Rosy-billed Pochard specimens found in
the area.
The researchers present at the Carlini Antarctic station, inferred
that its arrival might have been due to adverse natural conditions
(i.e storm with strong winds from the north sector), which would
have caused these individuals to lose their course. Due to both the
lack of usual food of these species, as well as the non suitable
environmental conditions for life, both specimens were found dead.
Measures adopted
In order to prevent potential disease transmission to native fauna it
was decided to collect and preserve the specimens found dead in a
cold chamber. The biological material samples will be part of a
collection as a record of the income of non-native species via
natural pathways. In addition, the specimens will be available for
various microbiological and parasitological studies.
Final considerations
The observation of the arrival of non-native species to the Antarctic
continent and in particular to the South Shetland islands via natural
pathways is a reality, as indicated by the references cited. In the
particular case of the birds found in October 2013, they could have
introduced microorganisms to the Antarctic continent.
Microbiological and parasitological studies will be necessary to
determine this. Argentina considers critical to have this background
information related to non-native species origin, in the context of
discussions on the introduction of species to the Antarctic continent,
in terms of determining its origin.
