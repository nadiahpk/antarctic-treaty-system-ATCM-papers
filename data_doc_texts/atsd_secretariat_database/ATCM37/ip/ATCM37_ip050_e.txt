Operational Ice Information around Antarctica








Operational Ice Information around Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by Germany

The broad news coverage about the MV Akademik Shokalskiy beset off Antarctica highlights the importance and the need to have reliable and up-to-date information on sea ice for safe shipping in the ice-covered waters of Antarctica. The ice services of the world (see publication 574 of the World Meteorological Organization at http://wdc.aari.ru/wmo/docs/WMO574.pdf) deliver some information, mostly in the form of ice charts, about current sea ice conditions around Antarctica. Most of this information is publicly available on the web at the individual ice centers or at the JCOMM (Joint Commission of Oceanography and Marine Meteorology) Ice Logistics portal (website at http://www.bsis-ice.de/IcePortal/). Additionally, some of the satellite data used in the production of these ice charts is publicly available on the web at these, or other, web sites.
However, compared to the ice-infested regions of the northern hemisphere (e.g. Baltic Sea), where daily ice charts are available, the spatial and temporal resolution of the Antarctic ice charts is low. At the last meeting of the International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG, see https://nsidc.org/noaa/iicwg/) in October 2013, it was decided that the three ice services currently producing Antarctic ice charts (USA, Russia and Norway) should work closer together and harmonize their production, so that, in the near future, at least weekly charts would be available to mariners on a regular basis. In this regard, there will be a special session on Antarctic ice charting at the JCOMM Ice Analysts’ Workshop to be held in June, 2014 in Helsinki. 
The results of this collaborative work and future steps towards improving ice information in Antarctic waters will be discussed at the next IICWG meeting in Chile. This meeting will have a special focus on Antarctica with the intention of engaging the southern hemisphere ice services and bringing operational users together with ice information producers to learn, through presentations and dialogue, how user needs could be better met.
To improve marine safety around Antarctica, the IICWG is seeking input about the specific needs of Antarctic stakeholders regarding operational ice information, as well as the information and procedures required for emergency response. Experts who can provide valuable input, even if they are not members of national ice services, are welcome to attend the IICWG meetings. The next meeting will be held from October 20th to 25th in Punta Arenas, Chile. 
Those seeking more information are asked to contact the IICWG Secretariat.
