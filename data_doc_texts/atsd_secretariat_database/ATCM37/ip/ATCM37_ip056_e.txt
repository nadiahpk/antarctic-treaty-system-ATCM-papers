Initial Environmental Evaluation for the realization of a new access road to Enigma Lake Twin Otter Runway at Mario Zucchelli Station, Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica

1.	Introduction

In 2006, Italy presented at Edimburg IP 42, an IEE concerning the contruction and operation of a runway located at Enigma Lake. This skiway is located between Enigma and Carezza lakes and is used as an alternate landing site for light aircrafts, such as Twin Otters, when the fast ice runway located at Tethys Bay is not anymore suitable for landing at a certain point of the season.  
In IP 42-2006 the realization of the runway and of two access roads to the site were foreseen and resulted in an evaluation of an impact “no more than minor or transitory”. However  for practical reasons, only one of the two roads was effectively realized. 
This paper presents the environmental evaluation of the second road, which partially differs from the previous already authorized one.
Description of the environment from geological and morphological point of view is provided with  updated description of flora and fauna and main environmental characteristics, considerations of impacts as well as mitigation measures.

2.  Purpose and Need

In the recent years deterioration of Enigma Lake runway access road conditions resulted in poor safety conditions in terms of slope stability (Fig. 1). Actually, the slope is usually affected by rock-fall phenomena that involve blocks of pluri-metric volume thus requiring exstensive maintenance. This is because it is located in correspondence of a high topographic gradient where lithologies such as tabular gabbro, morainic debris and, in the terminal part, fractured granite rock-mass, are present. This framework makes the slope unstable and the road affected by rock-fall.
Therefore a new solution needed to be found to ensure safety of operations when temperatures do not allow anymore the use of an ice runway.

On the base of the lithological and morphological structures present in the area, other hypothesis to connect the italian station with the Enigma site were analysed. 
The  study was carried out on the base of an ortho-restitution map with contour lines at 2.5 meters (nominal scale 1: 2,500) produced by processing of satellyte data set images (Geo-Eyes).


3.	Description of the area 
	3.1	Geological and Geomorphological framework

As also indicated in IP 42, the Northern Foothills area and the coastal area neighboring the Italian Mario Zucchelli Station, are composed almost exclusively of Ross-related intrusive rocks of contrasting composition and structure. The whole assemblage of intrusive units represents an example of a multipulse igneous complex built up during the evolution of an orogenic phase, and is collectively called the Terra Nova Intrusive Complex (Baroni 1987, Orombelli 1986).

A detailed geomorphological map of the area of interest was elaborated by Baroni, 1987 (Fig. 2). 



Fig 2. Geomorphological map of the northern foothills near Italian Station Mario Zucchelli (MZS).



Mapped landform and deposits include those related to glaciers, cryogenic activity, wind and sea action, weathering and geological structure. 
The morphology and the local geological conditions of the area surrounding the station MZS affected the choice of the paths of access to the Enigma site that is placed at an altitude of 180 m above sea level.



Excluding the western portion of the area, characterized by slopes formed by morainic deposits, gabbros and intensely fractured granites, the only available  alternative was to build a new road in correspondence of the eastern sector where solid granite outcrops. 






3.2	Meteorology 

The Meteorological Observatory of the Italian National Antarctic Program has a long historical series of data of pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation. 

The climate in the area is cold and arid.  The annual path of average monthly temperatures shows the typical behavior of tha Antarctic climate with the lack of a well defined winter minimum, a short summer, the absence of intermediate seasons and the reversal of the temperature pattern in mid-winter.  
The mean monthly air temperature recorded in the most significative meteorological station ranged between -16 and -3,5°C in the summer period  (1993-2011 period), with a mean annual temperature of -14 °C. The region receives  around 270 mm water equivalent precipitation per year. 

Fig. 3 The wind rose of Terra Nova Bay area.

From the wind rose presented in figure 3 it can be seen that the prevailing winds in Terra Nova blow from western sectors. They are associated mainly with the katabatic flow coming from Reeves Glacier and the wind speed can reach values over 40 knots. Katabatic flows from the Priestly Glacier are lighter because of the shielding effect of the Northern Foothills.  October and February are the summer month in which the episodes of winds with speeds higher than 30 knots were recorded more than 20% of the time.

3.3	Biotic characteristics of the site

In IP42 (2006) a study of the environmental chacarcteristics of the site was already presented. The three lakes (Enigma lake, Carezza lake and Skua lake) present in the area were extensiveley studied (Cox and Deason, 1968; Cavacini, 2001, Cavacini et al., 2006; Gragnani R. & Torcini S. 1989, Argano and Carchini, 1991, Guilizzoni et al., 1991).

Vegetation of Victoria Land is entirely cryptogamic and vascular plants are absent. The recorded flora comprises 57 lichens, 11 mosses, one liverwort and various species of algae and cyanobacteria (Castello, 2003; Castello and Nimis, 1995 a,b; Castello and Nimis 1997, Adams et al., 2006). 
Information about the presence of lichens in the studied area derived from VICTORIA, an online information system on Antarctic lichens, developed in the framework of the Italian National Antarctic Program (PNRA) (http://dbiodbs.univ.trieste.it/antartide/victoria).
The lichens presents in the considered area are prevalently nitrophilous, due to the nutrient enrichment of soils from skuas present in the vicinity of Campo Antenne. 

At approximatively 9-11 Km far away from the proposed road, an Adelie penguin colony of approximately 10.000 pairs is present. The penguin colony is located in front of the marine protected area ASPA N.161 of Terranova Bay but not included in it. Colonies of storm petrel and skuas are also present nearby the penguin colony. Information about the colony of Adelie are reported in the “Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No 161”. In the area we can also see a high presence of skuas.

The proposed link road through the Campo Antenna site is located outside the ASPA n. 161, and the nearest point is located about 1000 m far from its northern boundary (fig.4)

4.	Description of the proposed action, alternatives

The construction of a new access road is necessary for safety reasons and different paths were examined to limit the volume of material to be moved.
Lithologic and topographic featured recommend to realize the access road in correspondence of the eastern sector of Terranova Bay, where granitic bedrock and its relate debris deposits outcrop.

For the road realization, two different scenarios are proposed (Fig.5),one of them being the prolongation of the existing access road to the site of the seismic cave (see red path in figure 5). This option, called “Fast Road”, would result in a  total length of about 4000 m. 

The second scenario (see blue path in figure 5) differs from the previous one just for the initial part, and it is located in the southern sector of the Mario Zucchelli Station. This option, called “Transit-Road”, would need a greater processing (for the initial part), with a final length of about 4500 m.

Other alternatives to the above described routes would not be realistic considering the geomorphological conformation of the territory.



Fig. 5 The existing road (green path) and the two different scenarios proposed in the study.

Overall, the new road can be divided into three morphologic distinct sectors. The first, located on a slope, reaches the Campo Antenne area (red area in Figure 6); the second one is a nearly flat area (Campo Antenne, green area in Figure 6) and the third one connects Campo Antenne’s southern limit (E-W direction) with the Enigma Lake site (blue area in Figure 6). 
In both the alternative (Fast and Transit Road) the operational difficulties mainly reside in the first  sector (red area in figure 6), where slopes have an average inclination of 40-45%.



Fig. 6  Subdivision of the area of interest in topographic sectors

















The “Transit Road” initial part (of approximately 1500 m) would be set directly on the granite bedrock. On one hand it would allow excellent characteristic to the stucture while on the other hand it would require additional debris material to be found directly on site.
For the “Fast Road” (length of about 900 m for the initial part) the debris granitic material present on the slope shows a good load-bearing capacity and is easily compacting. Workability in terms of earth-moving is expected to be good. In terms of stability the slope is not affected by ongoing gravitational phenomena. This solution would be the fastest to realize.

To follow, the Campo Antenne site, distinct by a length of about 1500 m and by an average gradient of 4-5% in the SSE direction (green zone in figure 6), does not show particular operational difficulties in the road construction. In this area deposits of alteration of the surrounding granitic bedrock are present. The works to be performed consists of removal the boulders present along the axis of the track. In the terminal portion the morainic deposits outcropped are also easy  to work. 

The last and final stretch of the road allow the access to Enigma Lake runway (blue sector in figure 6). It is of  about 1300 m in length and is characterized by a constant gradient until the morphological threshold near the Enigma Lake site.

Overall, both works should be carried out to ensure the availability of primary and secondary access road towards a site that has a strategic importance on the Italian logistic activities. For poor slope stability condition recently rising on the present road we needed to start as soon as possible the realization of the road that would require less time.  Accordingly we decided to start with the Fast Road that is easily and faster realizable compare to the Transi Road.  Is possible to assume the opera realization in one season.

With the aim to have an estimate of the volumes necessary for the Fast Road realization, a series of references has been located on the Geo-Eyes ortho-restitution map (Figure 7 and Table 1) and the path of the road has been divided into 9 different sectors, based on the adopted excavation method (i.e., cut & fill, trench or embankment, see in Table 1).


Fig. 7 New road path considering the option Fast-road and related gradients (K0 to K44)















Table 1. Different sectors of the Fast-road and related estimate volume.

The Fast Road will have a total length of 3920 m and evaluated volume of about 4500 m3. 
The operations will consist in scraping and digging for the realization of the carrable path. 
The activity will involve the movement of earth and rocks by tracked vehicles in order to have a suitable surface. For the realization of this work the heavy equipment already present at MZS will be used (excavators, wheel loaders and dumper). The estimated working time is about 30 working days.

5.	Anthropic presence, expected impact of the new infrastructure 

Human impacts within the area are already present and arising from the nearby Terranova Bay station and scientific work conducted within the area. The presence of synthetic and toxic chemicals in the Antarctic ecosystems is partially associated with the activities of the scientific stations. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) include several groups of chemicals with similar structures and physical–chemical properties that elicit same toxic effects. The POP accumulation and distribution in the Terranova Bay trophic webs were studied since the late eighties and results were published in peer reviewed international scientific journals (Corsolini S., 2011, Corsolini S. at al. 2011).
The presence of MZS produced inevitable impacts in the last 28 years around the area, from the construction and growth of the base, to scientific and logistic activities such as air and vessel operations and field camps. Since the beginning of the Italian operations, a monitoring program was carried out to identify and mitigate possible impacts.
The nearest structures are MZS, Enigma lake skiway and the antenna farm of Campo Antenne.
The road was designed in such a way as to ensure safety conditions and to limit the volume of material to scrap or  transport and is expected to have a slight impact on the landscape.
During the construction phase, no major impacts are expected as the construction work will mainly consist of an in situ excavation and related debris movement in the nearby area.
In case of accident, minor fuel spill from equipment may be produced. Fuel and oil spills may occur during the processes of excavation and use of equipments. However, thanks to the proximity to MZS station, all fuel transfers will be conducted at the station using standardized and well known procedures. Spills, in case of accident, are expected to be of minor intensity and confined at the site. 

The following response equipments are available at the station:

1) Oil absorbing mats for refueling sites;
2) Spill kits containing absorbent pillows and fabric for vehicles and field parties;
3) Protective plastic barrels for 200 liter fuel drums;
4) Plastic bags;
5) Protective masks and rubber gloves.

During construction, noise may disturb fauna present at the site. An evaluation of noise emission of the machineries already present at MZS is reported in table below:

The most noisy operations for this road construction will consist in digging and beating of the earth for the realization of the carrable path. The activity will involve:
1. Movement of earth and rocks by tracked vehicles in order to have a suitable surface for the passage of the vehicles.
2. Exhaust gas emissions
3. Acoustic emissions.

6. 	Impact Assesment and Mitigation Measures

The intensity of a potential impact on Antarctic environment (atmosphere, soil/glacier, sea, flora and fauna, etc.) can be classified into different levels for each of its four different aspects: probability, extent, duration and importance of impact. The  Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica 2006 were considered.
The impact and mitigation actions for each environmental sector are reported in the following tables. Impacts will be generated mostly during construction phase as in operation phase they will be the same that what evidenced in IP42, 2006.

Noise

ground transport operations and the produced noise have the potential to disturb and to impact negatively on bird life. A gradient of increasing behavioural response is evident in birds when exposed to increasing aircraft stimulus. The most major disturbance is likely to lead to impacts on the health, breeding performance and survival of individual birds, and perhaps bird colonies .

The exposure is time limited

Minimum horizontal and vertical separation distances for aircraft operations close to concentrations of birds in Antarctica as recommended by the SCAR Bird Biology Subgroup, are verified. 

Also the recommendations of the new guidelines adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in June 2004 will be respected.

Take-off and landing will be in the opposite direction respect to the penguins colony. So the aircraft never overfly the colony.

Obstruction

Birds killed in aircraft encounters is relatively high in the more populated parts of the world (see e.g. www.birdstrike.org). In the case of this access roads to the runway the number of such incidents is expected to be very low (if any) due to the low number of flights and the observed flight patterns for the birds. Only a few individuals would be affected, and no ripple effect would be expected.

7. 	Conclusions

The previous analysis, as reported in the table above, indicates that no major impacts are associated with the activities of construction of the ways of access to Enigma Lake skiway.
Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that no action arising from the proposed activities has "an impact on the environment more than minor or transitory". 
Only an impact associated with an emergency situation (accident) can have a high degree of intensity with reference to the impact expected for the normal operations in the area, but in such an eventaulity mitigation action are already planned for an immediate restraint achievement.
