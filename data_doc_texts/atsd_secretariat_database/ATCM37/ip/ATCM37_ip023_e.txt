Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (updated 2014)








       Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (updated 2014)
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

    1. At CEP XIII, XIV, XV and XVI Information Papers were submitted detailing the colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (ATCM XXXIII IP42; ATCM XXXIV IP50; ATCM XXXV IP29; ATCM XXXVI IP28).  An update on earlier information is provided in this Information Paper.
    2. As far as we are aware, in the last year there have been no new reports of non-native species becoming established within Antarctica; however, there has been further development in our understanding of the colonisation potential and biology of some of the non-native species described previously. 
    3. Information relating to these developments has been added to the information presented in previous years and is shown in Table 1 (in bold).

Plants not found, but propagules germinated from Antarctic soil.  Pollen found in soil suggests that mature plants may have existed at site.  Not known if J. bufonius was introduced by human or natural transport mechanisms.
