The 1912 Ascent of Mount Erebus by members of the Terra Nova Expedition: location of additional campsites and further information on HSM 89 


Information Paper presented by the United Kingdom, New Zealand and United States
Summary

In December 2012, two campsites from the ascent of Mount Erebus by members of Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition (1910–13) were located. In 2013, the ATCM designated these sites as Historic Sites and Monuments (HSM 89 and HSM 90 - Measures 20 and 21(2013)) due to their historic and scientific value.  Subsequent research at the Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, has provided information on the locations of other campsites from this expedition.  In 2013/14, three additional 1912 campsites were located by a British geologist, who was part of a United States Antarctic Program science team studying the Mount Erebus volcano. This ongoing research initiative hopes to locate all the campsites from the Heroic Age on Mount Erebus, and to discuss and develop ways in which they can be conserved and utilised for further historical and scientific research.

These three newly identified campsites are pre-1958. Assessment and evaluation is being undertaken by the relevant Parties, in accordance with the Guidelines for Handling of Pre-1958 Historic Remains whose Existence or Present Location is Not Known. ATCM XXIV: Resolution 5(2001).
 
Background

ATCM XXXVI/WP62 provided details of the first two of the campsites used by the six-man science party of the Terra Nova Expedition, led by geologist Raymond Priestley, who ascended Mount Erebus to undertake geological sampling and survey work.  These sites were listed as HSMs 89 and 90 at the last ATCM.  Further research has identified three further campsites on Mount Erebus, which are detailed below, as well as more information about the location of artefacts from the campsite designated as HSM 89.

Recently Located Campsites

Reflection Camp (also known as “Station B” near “Cone Nunatak”), Mount Erebus
    i. This site, near a prominent cone, was the location of the party’s first overnight stop after leaving Cape Royds. It was occupied between 4 and 7 December 1912. The site is at the edge of what appears to be a lava flow whose surface is partly exposed above the snow;

Crater Camp (or “Station E”), Mount Erebus
    i. This campsite was occupied on the night of 8/9 December 1912. It is in view of the Fang Ridge and heavily-seracced Fang glacier. One tent was pitched on the rock and gravel the other on the snow nearby;

    ii. Co-ordinates: 77° 29.071’ S, 167° 03.388’ E (circa 2,300 m above sea level).

Gully Camp, Mount Erebus
    i. The site was occupied on the night of 9/10 December 1912. It is located in a “gully” between a moraine and the rocky slopes of Erebus. It lies on the route lately established by the Search and Rescue team based in McMurdo for reaching Lower Erebus Hut by snowmobile. The surface is of snow; 

    ii. Co-ordinates: 77° 29.266’ S, 167° 06.164’ E (circa 2,490 m above sea level).

Historic Site and Monument 89

HSM 89: Terra Nova Expedition, “Upper Summit Camp” used during survey of Mount Erebus in December 1912. 
    i. Recent images taken of the site reveal that a food depot, left in 1912, has been dispersed downwind with a number of artefacts lodged in nearby rocks. It is important that these artefacts are not disturbed as they can provide genetic information regarding the food and other supplies taken up Mount Erebus in 1912; 
    ii. Position: 77° 30.348’ S, 167°10.223’ E (circa 3,410 m above sea level).



Three items of debris (ringed) about 40 m NNW (and ‘downwind’) of campsite. The glass bottle is located in the central ring.  December 2013, Professor Clive Oppenheimer.
