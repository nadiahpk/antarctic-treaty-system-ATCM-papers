Summary: This document provides a progress report on the work of IMO on the development of the International Code for ships operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code).


Background

1	Navigation in polar waters was first addressed by IMO through the development of the Guidelines for ships operating in Arctic ice-covered waters (MSC/Circ.1056 – MEPC/Circ.399), issued in 2002, which provided requirements additional to those of the SOLAS and MARPOL Conventions for navigation in Arctic waters, taking into account the specific climatic conditions in that area in order to meet appropriate standards of maritime safety and marine pollution prevention.

2	Following the approval of the above Guidelines, the Maritime Safety Committee of the Organization, at MSC 79 in 2004, considered a request by the XXVIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) for IMO to consider amending the Guidelines so that they would also be applicable to ships operating in ice covered waters in the Antarctic Treaty Area and instructed its Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Equipment (DE) to revise the Guidelines accordingly.

3	Consequently, DE 52 finalized a relevant draft Assembly resolution in 2009, addressing both Arctic and Antarctic areas, which, following approval by MSC 86 and MEPC 59, was adopted by the twenty-sixth IMO Assembly in December 2009 as resolution A.1024(26) on Guidelines for ships operating in polar waters (Polar Guidelines).

4	The Guidelines aim at mitigating the additional risk imposed on shipping due to the harsh environmental and climatic conditions existing in polar waters.  They address the fact that the polar environment imposes additional demands on ship systems, including navigation, communications, life‑saving appliances, main and auxiliary machinery, environmental protection and damage control, etc., and emphasize the need to ensure that all ship systems are capable of functioning effectively under anticipated operating conditions and provide adequate levels of safety in accident and emergency situations.  In addition, the Guidelines, recognizing that safe operation in such conditions requires special attention to human factors, includes specific training and operational procedures.  

5	Immediately after finalisation of the Polar Guidelines, MSC 86, having considered proposals to further develop them and create a mandatory Polar Code, agreed with those proposals and instructed the DE Sub-Committee to commence work on the development of a mandatory Code for ships operating in polar waters at DE 53 in February 2010.  

6	The new Code would cover the full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue and environmental protection issues relevant to ships operating in polar waters in order to address the increased interest and traffic in these regions and the unique operational, environmental and search and rescue concerns peculiar to these areas, taking into account that the consequences of any major safety or pollution incident in polar waters are likely to cause widespread harm to these pristine environments and also damage to the reputation of the shipping community.
Status of the work

7	Since then, the DE Sub-Committee has diligently worked on the development of the Polar Code through its annual meetings and intersessionally through a correspondence group under the coordination of Norway.  Chapters of the Code dealing with specific matters under the responsibilities of other expert IMO Sub-Committees were referred to them for review and advice. 

8	In 2013 IMO carried out a restructuring of its Sub-Committees following which the work on the development of the Polar Code continued under the coordination of the Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC) which met for its first session (SDC 1) from 20 to 24 January 2014.

9	SDC 1 agreed in principle to the draft text of the Polar Code and proposed associated draft amendments to IMO’s safety (SOLAS) and pollution prevention (MARPOL) treaties to make the Code mandatory, as follows:

.1	addition of a draft new chapter XIV “Safety measures for ships operating in polar waters” to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), to be further considered at MSC 93 (14 to 23 May 2014); and

.2	draft amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) to make the Polar Code mandatory under Annexes I (prevention of pollution by oil), II (noxious liquid substances), IV (sewage) and V (garbage), to be further considered by MEPC 66 (31 March to 4 April 2014).

The draft MARPOL and SOLAS amendments as well as the draft text of the Code are set out in annexes 1 to 3, respectively, of the report of SDC 1 (SDC 1/26).

10	The draft Polar Code covers the full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue and environmental protection matters relevant to ships operating in the inhospitable waters surrounding the two poles.  It includes mandatory measures covering maritime safety (part I-A – Safety measures) and marine pollution prevention (part II-A – Pollution prevention measures) and recommendatory provisions for both parts (parts I-B and II-B), providing additional guidance with regard to the mandatory provisions in parts I-A and II-A. 

11	The Polar Code would require ships intending to operate in Antarctic and Arctic waters, as defined in the Code, to carry a Polar Ship Certificate and a Polar Water Operational Manual, providing the owner, operator, master and crew with sufficient information regarding the ship's operational capabilities and limitations in order to support their decision-making.  

12	Each chapter in the Code sets out goals and functional requirements, to include in part I-A those covering ship structure; stability and subdivision; watertight and weathertight integrity; machinery installations; operational safety; fire safety/protection; life-saving appliances and arrangements; safety of navigation; communications; voyage planning; and manning and training; and in part II-A those covering prevention of oil pollution; prevention of pollution from noxious liquid substances; prevention of pollution by sewage from ships; and prevention of pollution by garbage.  

13	The draft Code, together with the associated draft SOLAS and MARPOL amendments to make it mandatory will be further considered by MEPC 66 and MSC 93 (see paragraph 9) with a view to adoption of the Code and the associated SOLAS amendments at MSC 94, followed by concurrent action concerning the Code and the associated MARPOL amendments at MEPC 68.

14	If the above timetable is adhered to, it can be expected, in accordance with the relevant amendment procedures, that the Code would become mandatory under SOLAS on 1 July 2016 and under MARPOL on 1 January 2017.
