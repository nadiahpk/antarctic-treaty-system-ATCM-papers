Antarctic Specially Protected Areas protecting geological features: a review 
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Summary
A review of existing and proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plans was undertaken to ascertain the level of protection afforded to geological features within the ASPA system.  This paper supplements the information contained within ATCM XXXVII WP35 The Antarctic Protected Area system: protection of outstanding geological features, submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia and Spain. 
Introduction
Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty states that ‘Parties shall seek to identify, within a systematic environmental-geographical framework, and to include in the series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas... ...examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features’ (Article 3 (2f)).  

To ascertain the level of protection of values relating to geological features within the ASPA system, a review of ASPA Management Plans was undertaken including the proposed new ASPAs for Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land and the High altitude geothermal sites of the Ross Sea Region (including parts of the summits of Mount Erebus, Ross Island and Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittmann, Northern Victoria Land) (see Appendix 1).  In particular, descriptions of any geological features identified within Section 1 ‘Description of values to be protected’ were noted.  Geological features were considered to include soils, fossils, stratigraphy, geomorphological features, type localities, minerals and geological structures. 

Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Scientific Zones and Restricted Zones (e.g., see Appendices D and E in the Management Plan for ASMA 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys, Southern Victoria Land) and Closed Areas described in Site Guidelines for Visitors (e.g. the guidelines for Hannah Point) that protect areas containing vulnerable geological features were not included in this review.  However, they may represent useful management tools for further protection of geological features.  
Results
Geological and/or geomorphological features were mentioned in the ‘Description of values to be protected’ of 28 ASPA Management Plans.  A summary of the results is presented in Table 1.

Six Management Plans listed geological and/or geomorphological features as the primary reason for which the areas were designated with ASPA status.  This represents only 8% of ASPAs in the Protected Area system (i.e., ASPAs 125, 143, 147, 148, 168, and the proposed new ASPA at Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land).  

Geomorphological features and/or soils were protected in 22 out of the 28 ASPAs protecting geological features (79%).  Fossils were protected in 13 out of 28 ASPAs protecting geological features (46%).  ASPAs protecting, mineralogy, igneous and metamorphic rocks and associated structural geology numbered only c. four ASPAs, with these features representing the primary reason for designation in only one ASPA (i.e., the proposed ASPA for Stornes, Larsemann Hills).
Conclusions
Analysis of ASPA Management Plans revealed that: 

    • the description of the geological features considered worthy of protection was often unclear and lacked detail (e.g., why were the protected features considered to be ‘outstanding’, compared with other geological features in the vicinity?);
    • information describing the location of the geological features of value was often imprecise or missing (i.e., in general, geographic coordinates were not provided);
    • little information was given regarding how to ascertain appropriate levels of geological sampling for present-day scientific purposes, while taking into consideration cumulative sampling impact and future scientific needs; and
    • text was often included in Section 6: ‘Description of the Area’ describing the area’s features of interest to geologist and geomorphologist, but in many cases these features were not listed specifically in Section 1: ‘Description of values to be protected’, making it difficult to know if they contributed to the area’s values and, therefore, its specially protected status.

In particular, it was noted that geological features have not been protected within a systematic environmental-geographical framework, as an appropriate model has not been approved by the ATCM.

It is hoped that these finding may prove useful in the CEP’s discussions on the Antarctic Protected Area system, and in particular, those relating to protection of geological features.

Continental glacial sequence of “Polonez Formation” (tillites and glacial diamicts bearing erratic clasts) provides the oldest known hard evidence of the coming Cenozoic glaciation (28-32 SIS dating).

Type locality for three new minerals 
A diverse suite of borosilicate minerals and phosphate minerals
Marine fossils
Earlier protected area designation
N/A
Text from proposed Management Plan  ‘Description of values to be protected’
‘Stornes is unique on account of the presence of a diverse suite of borosilicate minerals (five species) and phosphate minerals (nine species). The relatively rare borosilicates prismatine and grandidierite are found abundantly in spectacular crystals and segregations over a wide area, while the ferromagnesian fluorphosphate wagnerite forms spectacular nodules locally and microscopic grains regionally. 
Stornes is the discovery (or type) locality for three new mineral species: the boron mineral boralsilite and the phosphate minerals stornesite-(yttrium) and tassieite. In addition, wagnerite occurs as two different polytypes (that is, having the same chemical formula but different crystal structure); indeed the first discovery of wagnerite showing polytypism was in specimens from the Larsemann Hills. Furthermore, the boron minerals grandidierite, prismatine and dumortierite, as well as wagnerite, are present in unusual abundance or as large crystals in the Larsemann Hills; few localities elsewhere in the world can compare. It is the spectacular development of these minerals and boralsilite, one of the few recently described minerals to be readily visible to the naked eye, which makes these rare minerals vulnerable to damage.’  Further text is included in the Management Plan ‘Description of values to be protected’.

Text from proposed Management Plan  ‘Description of values to be protected’
‘The Ross Sea region has considerable areas of Quaternary and later Neogene volcanism. However, only three sites, Mounts Erebus, Melbourne and Rittmann, have been confirmed to show signs of present day geothermal activity. Fumaroles (opening in the ground emitting steam) and steaming warm ground are the surface manifestation of geothermal activity at these sites. Hollow ice towers or ice pinnacles (chimneys) can form around fumaroles up to many metres in diameter and height, formed by the condensation and freezing of water vapour. Ice and snow hummocks are also present over geothermally heated ground. Other areas of heated ground are commonly ice free during summer and maintain surface temperatures greater than ambient air temperatures.’
