Report by the Depositary Government for the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in Accordance with Recommendation XIII-2, Paragraph 2(D)
Report submitted by the United Kingdom


New Accessions to CCAS

No requests to accede to CCAS have been received since the previous Report; ATCM XXXVI /IP013.

Following a request from Spain in 2012, all Contracting Parties confirmed consent, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Convention, for the Spanish Government to be formally invited to deposit an instrument of accession.  The UK communicated this to the Spanish Government on 25th March 2013. However, to date no instrument of accession from Spain has been received by the UK. Spain would formally accede to the Convention 30 days after such an instrument of accession was received by the UK.

The full list of countries which were original signatories to the Convention, and countries which have subsequently acceded is attached to this report (Annex A).

CCAS Annual Return 2012/2013

Annex B lists all capturing and killing of Antarctic seals by Contracting Parties to CCAS for the reporting year 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2013. All reported captures were for scientific research.

Next CCAS Annual Return

Contracting Parties to CCAS are again reminded that the Exchange of Information, referred to in Paragraph 6(a) in the Annex to the Convention, for the reporting period of 1 March 2013 to 28 February 2014 is due by 30 June 2014.  CCAS Parties should submit their returns, including nil returns, to both the United Kingdom and to SCAR.  The UK would like to encourage all Contracting Parties to CCAS to submit their returns on time.  

The CCAS report for the reporting period 2013/2014 will be submitted to ATCM XXXVIII, once the June 2014 deadline for exchange of information has passed.
