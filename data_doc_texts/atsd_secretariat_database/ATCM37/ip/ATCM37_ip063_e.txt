Results of drilling operations for the study of the lower part of the glacier in deep borehole at Vostok station in the season 2013-2014
Information Paper submitted by the Russian Federation
At ATCM XXXVI in Brussels in May 2013, the Delegation of Russia presented its Information Paper (IP) 49 “Results of studies of subglacial Lake Vostok and drilling operations in deep ice borehole of Vostok station in the season 2012-2013”. It was reported that drilling out the “fresh frozen” ice core from surface water of subglacial Lake Vostok that had raised upward the borehole after penetration to the lake on 5 February 2012 occurred in the depth range of 3406-3460 m. After this the drill deviated from the location of borehole 5G-2 for the reasons not dependent on the performers of the work and drilling was continued to a depth of 3543.56 m in the ice strata of lake origin. The new borehole beginning from a depth of 3460 m was named borehole 5G-3. 
The work of the glacial-drilling team of the 59th seasonal Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) at Vostok station in the season 2013-2014 began on 3 December 2013, when the main group of the drilling team arrived to Vostok station. In total, the glacial-drilling team consisted of 10 specialists with 6 of them representing the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, 2 – the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute and 2 – St. Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics. Besides, the participants of the wintering teams of the 58th and 59th RAE of Vostok station took part in the drilling activities. This made it possible to provide drilling operations in the borehole for 24 h and carry out different types of preparation work in the premises of the drilling complex and planned scientific investigations of the ice core and the snow cover in the vicinity of Vostok station.  This season the drilling of borehole 5G-3 in the depth range of 3543.56-3724.42 m was continued. From 6 to 21 December, a complex of geophysical studies and preparation work were performed in the borehole including caliper log measurements (change of the borehole diameter with depth), inclinometer surveying (measurement of the spatial borehole location in the glacial body), measurements of the vertical distribution of the drilling fluid temperature and pressure in the borehole, sampling and measurement of the drilling fluid density. On the borehole segments where a decrease of its diameter (less than 138 mm) was registered, its enlargement to a diameter of 138 mm was performed. The results of the caliper log measurements showed a significant narrowing of the borehole (in some places up to 132 mm, i.e., less than the drill bit diameter) from the time of the end of drilling in the season of the 58th RAE (2012-2013). Such significant narrowing of the borehole was caused by a large pressure difference between the ice and the drilling fluid due to the insufficiently high density of the latter, which was confirmed by the measurements made. This is connected with a shortage of Freon (F -141b) delivered to Vostok station in late January 2013.  
Core drilling of the borehole in the season 2013-2014 began on 22 December and continued until 2 February with brief interruptions connected with repair of ground drilling equipment, borehole enlargement and Freon filling. In total for 43 days of direct drilling activities, 181 m of the lake ice core was recovered to the surface. The ice core output per run comprised on average 2.25 m to a depth of 3680 m, 1.80 m in the depth range of 3680-3705 m and 0.90 m in the range of 3705-3724 m. The change of the ice core length per run was related to a sharp increase of the ice temperature with the borehole bottom approaching the “ice-water” boundary and correspondingly to the changes in the physical-mechanical ice properties.
Delivery of Freon (F-141b) was by means of the sledge-tractor traverses from Progress station which arrive to Vostok station in late January. In this connection pouring of Freon (F-141b) to the borehole was made twice: on 27 January 2013 (at the borehole depth of 3543.56 m) when 425 liters of Freon was delivered to the depth range of 800-1500 m and on 19 January 2014 (at the borehole depth of 3684 m) when 850 liters was delivered to the depth range of 1000-1900 m. The shortage of Freon at the station could not provide a sufficient density of the drilling fluid and the required compensation of the overburden pressure. According to calculations, the pressure difference between the ice and the drilling fluid in the bottom part of the borehole exceeded 6 bars at the end of drilling operations. So by the beginning of the season 2014-2015 one should expect a significant narrowing of the borehole, which will require much additional work for its enlargement before resuming coring drilling. 
After the drilling was stopped, the repeated measurements of the borehole diameter and its inclination were made on 3 February 2014. The inclinometer survey showed a gradual decrease of the inclination angle of the new borehole 5G-3 with the increase of its depth relative to the initial inclination angle of borehole 5G-3. At a depth of 3480 m, the inclination angle of borehole 5G-3 from the vertical decreased from 5º to 3º in the near-bottom part of the borehole – 3724.42 m.
After termination of drilling operations in borehole 5G-3 in the season 2013-2014, specialists of the team replaced the drilling winch cable by a new one, which was delivered from St. Petersburg by ship to Progress station in December 2013 and then further to Vostok station by means of the sledge-tractor traverse. Replacement of the cable was caused by serious defects in its metal sheath, which were detected in the lower part of the cable coil and therefore they were revealed only after a full spooling of the new cable to the drilling winch drum.
Glaciologists of the team continued operational analyses of the newly retrieved ice cores, description of their structure and preparation for transportation to St. Petersburg and for storage in the storage area of Vostok station. The ice core section obtained in the seasons 2012-2013 (“fresh frozen” ice) and 2013-2014 were delivered to St. Petersburg onboard the R/V “Akademik Fedorov”.
The results of drilling operations in the season 2013-2014 at Vostok station showed that about 45 m of ice remained to be drilled to the “ice-water” boundary. This is quite a feasible task, the more so as the performers of the work already know the real glacier thickness, which comprises 3769.3 m.
