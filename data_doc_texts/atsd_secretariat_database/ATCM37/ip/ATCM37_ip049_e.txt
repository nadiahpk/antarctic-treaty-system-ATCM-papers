The role of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in protecting the marine environment through marine spatial protection

Information Paper submitted by The Netherlands1
Summary
This Information Paper examines the responsibility of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in relation to marine spatial protection and identifies the legal instruments that are available to implement this responsibility. Next, the paper provides an overview of the actual use of these instruments. A series of maps illustrate marine spatial protection under Antarctic Treaty system instruments, primarily those of the ATCM. There have been several positive interactions between the ATCM, the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) regarding the harmonisation of marine spatial protection efforts, including the adoption of several protected areas with a marine component that were adopted in accordance with Decision 9 (2005). However, the analysis also shows that establishing marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area is a slow process and that the output of actual overall protection by the ATCM anno 2014 is limited. It is concluded that further work towards greater harmonisation between the work of the ATCM/CEP and CCAMLR on marine spatial protection is required.
Introduction
As stated in Article IX, paragraph 1 (f), of the Antarctic Treaty (1959), the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) bear responsibility in respect of the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica. 
During the first two decades since the entering into force of the Treaty, this responsibility has been implemented through the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964, the Agreed Measures), the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972, CCAS) and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980, CAMLR Convention). The CAMLR Convention establishes the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which implements the CAMLR Convention by, inter alia, Conservation Measures and Resolutions.
Through the implementation of these international agreements, additional instruments adopted by the ATCM and the CCAMLR, and particularly the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991, the Protocol), environmental protection has been further strengthened for both the terrestrial and marine environments. 
From the perspective of the protection and conservation of the marine environment, the different instruments available constitute a "legal tool box" from which the relevant State Parties may choose the most promising instrument, depending on, e.g., particular marine environmental values and uses. However, this diversity of instruments and legal fundaments may also create uncertainty or confusion in respect of responsibilities and competences, particularly in relation to the ATCM and the CCAMLR, with their overlapping but not identical areas of application and membership. More practically, this situation makes it also difficult to get a clear overview of the current spatial protection of the marine environment in the Antarctic Treaty area (the area south of the 60 degrees South Latitude).
In this context, this Information Paper aims to respond three key theoretical and empirical questions regarding the role of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in protecting the marine environment through marine spatial protection:
    I. What is the responsibility of the ATCM in relation to protecting the marine environment by means of spatial protection tools, and what instruments are available to implement this responsibility?
The answer to this question is based on an inventory of legal provisions relevant to marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area (Section 2).
    II. To what extent have the instruments described question I been applied to marine spatial protection? 
This question is answered on the basis of an analysis of the concrete outputs of the ATCM in relation to marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area (Section 3). Emphasis is placed on the main instruments available to the ATCM i.e. Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) and Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs). The use of marine spatial protection instruments available under  the CCAS and the CAMLR Convention is also discussed briefly. A series of maps and tables were prepared to provide an overview marine spatial protection under the ATCM, CCAS and CCAMLR (Appendixes I and II).
    III. What insights can be gained by comparing the answers to questions I and II?
The answer to this question is based on contrasting legal responsibilities with practical implementation efforts, including theoretical and empirical discussions in the context of the ATCM/CEP (Section 4). 
Section 5 contains the conclusions.
The ATCM’s responsibility and legal instruments for marine spatial protection in Antarctica 
Several international conventions within and outside the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) provide for marine protection in the Antarctic Treaty area, including elements for marine spatial protection. In broad terms, the instruments differ from one to the other on what is protected and from which activities, as well as on their total area of spatial coverage, which may extend beyond the Antarctic Treaty area. 
Before focusing on the ATS instruments, some instruments for marine spatial protection under conventions outside the ATS receive attention. This is of relevance for the first research question of this paper, as the ATCM has intensively debated some of these instruments.
2.1	Marine spatial protection under conventions outside the ATS
Relevant conventions outside of the ATS include the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78), under which the entire Antarctic Treaty area has been designated as a special area where the discharge of certain categories of waste is more strictly regulated or even prohibited.2 Another example is the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), under which the Antarctic Ocean south of the convergence has been designated as a whale sanctuary where commercial whaling is banned.3 As explained by K. Scott, both areas "are both strictly one dimensional MPAs, supporting a single purpose" and "[n]either MPAs can be said to support integrated ecosystem-based management of activities taking place within the southern Ocean."4 
The legal instruments of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), while not considered part of the ATS, are regularly discussed by the ATCM. These instruments are generally highly valued as a contribution to the aims of the ATS, for instance through the development by IMO of a Polar Shipping Code. An example is Resolution 1 (2009) in which the ATCM acknowledges "the value of cooperation as among Parties and through the International Maritime Organization to prevent marine pollution". Through Resolution 1 (2009), CCAMLR was invited "to provide its views to the ATCM on the possibility of asking the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to amend the Antarctic Special Area to extend its boundary northward to the Antarctic Convergence." This proposal was discussed at the CCAMLR meeting in 2009, but did not result in further action from the ATCM. Nonetheless, this example (further discussed below) illustrates the importance the ATCM assigns to the role of the IMO, including through marine spatial protection. 
2.2	Instruments for marine spatial protection within the ATS
The protection of the marine environment has received much attention in all international agreements that are part of the ATS. The provisions of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty extend to the area south of 60o south latitude, including all ice shelves, without prejudice to the rights, or the exercise of the rights, of any State under international law with regard to the high seas within that area (Article VI). Under Art IX, Parties to the Treaty are to meet periodically for the purpose of exchanging information, consulting together on matters of common interest pertaining to Antarctica, and formulating and considering, and recommending to their Governments, measures in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty including measures regarding, inter alia, the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica (Art. IX (f)).
Since the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty in 1961, various instruments have been adopted in which the responsibility of the ATCM for the preservation and conservation of Antarctic living resources has been elaborated in more detail. Such early measures did often not distinguish between terrestrial or marine living resources, and applied to all living resources in the Antarctic Treaty area. For instance, the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, adopted in 1964 (Recommendation III-VIII), also applied to mammals, which in Antarctica are all marine species. The Preamble of the Agreed Measures stipulates: "Hereby consider the Treaty Area as a Special Conservation Area and have agreed on the following measures." In line with this consideration, Article VII(1) of the Agreed Measures affirms that "Each Participating Government shall take appropriate measures to minimize harmful interference within the Treaty Area with the normal living conditions of any native mammal or bird, or any attempt at such harmful interference, except as permitted under Article VI."  The Agreed Measures were also the first ATS instrument that established a basis for designating "Specially Protected Areas" (see Article VIII(1)) and because the Agreed Measures applied to the area south of 60 degrees south latitude and did not distinguish between the terrestrial and marine environment, it also provided the option of designating "specially" marine protected areas.5 "Specially" because, as explained, the entire Antarctic Treaty area, including all waters south of 60 degrees South Latitude, was already considered a special conservation area. 
In 1966, prior to the adoption of the CCAS, and following the submission of WP57 by the UK and USA, the ATCM adopted Recommendation IV-21 (1966) Voluntary measures on pelagic sealing which, among other measures taken "...to promote and achieve the objectives of protection, scientific study and rational use of Antarctic seals", divided the Antarctic Treaty area in a number of sealing areas that amounted, to a certain extent, to forms of marine spatial protection. Based on this and other Recommendations (e.g., Recommendation IV-16 (Santiago, 1966) that designated all species of the genus Arctocephalus, fur seals, as "Specially Protected Species" under Article VI(5) of the Agreed Measures), the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals was adopted in 1972. The Convention includes a spatial protection instrument: under Article 3(1)(d), specific measures may include "open and closed areas, including the designation of reserves." 
In 1975, the ATCM discussed ATCM VIII/WP03 (a SCAR paper submitted by Norway) noting that a number of SCAR National Committees had expressed interest in the possibility of designating inshore marine areas either as Specially Protected Areas or as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.6 The Committees noted a distinct need for affording some degree of protection to selected inshore areas, including representative, unique, type locality, and inviolate areas; however, the SCAR assessment was that "... at present this is not possible under the Agreed Measures for the Preservation of Flora and Fauna as they apply to terrestrial and ice shelf areas only". This assessment by SCAR was discussed in the ATCM Legal Working Group, which concluded:
The representatives in the Working Group agreed that the interpretation by SCAR of Article VI of the Treaty and Article I of the Agreed Measures was too restrictive and that consideration of marine areas as Specially Protected Areas or Sites of Special Scientific Interest is possible under the provisions of the Treaty and the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.7
In 1977, Chile proposed a draft recommendation for Governments inviting SCAR "to make suggestions for the designation of Marine Sites of Special Scientific Interest for consideration at the Tenth Consultative Meeting."8 Chile also noted its intention to propose to SCAR two marine SSSIs (para. 16, ATCM IX Final Report). At the same ATCM, Recommendation IX-2 on "Antarctic Marine Living Resources" was adopted. With this Recommendation, the Consultative Parties recall "[t]heir "special responsibilities […] in respect of the preservation and conservation of living resources in the Antarctic", note "that concentrations of marine living resources are found in the Antarctic Treaty area and adjacent waters" and recognize "the urgency of ensuring that these resources are protected by the establishment of sound conservation measures which will prevent overfishing and protect the integrity of the Antarctic ecosystem." On the basis of this acknowledgment, the ATCM adopted "Interim guidelines pending entry into force of the definitive regime for Antarctic Marine Living Resources" as part of Recommendation IX-2.
A few years later, this Recommendation was followed by the adoption of the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. This Convention has established several instruments of marine spatial protection, including sites used for the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). These instruments and their application are discussed in Section 3 below. 
The 1991 Protocol of Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty takes a similar approach as the Agreed Measures: The complete Antarctic Treaty area, including the marine environment south of 60 degrees South Latitude, is designated as "a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science" (Article 2), while certain areas may receive special protection or management (Annex V). Annex V to the Protocol establishes the designation of ASPAs and ASMAs.9 Such areas may include any marine area south of 60 degrees South Latitude,10 and therefore are the primary instruments of the Protocol for marine spatial protection. The main difference between ASPAs and ASMAs is that the former is designed to protect "outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values, or ongoing or planned scientific research" (Article 3(1) Annex V), whilst the latter is designed "to assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, improve co-operation between Parties or minimize environmental impacts" (Article 4(1) Annex V). Activities in ASMAs and ASPAs "shall be prohibited, restricted or managed in accordance with Management Plans adopted under the provisions of this Annex” (Article 2 Annex V). Entry into an ASPA "shall be prohibited except in accordance with a permit issued under Article 7” (Article 3(4) Annex V). Activities in ASMAs do not require a permit (Article 4(3) Annex V) and are regulated on the basis of a code of conduct that is included in the management plan (Article 5(3)(j) Annex V). Reviews of management plans, for both ASPAs and ASMAs, shall be initiated at least every five years, and the plans shall be updated if necessary (Article 6(3) Annex V). Management plans may be amended or revoked in accordance with the designation procedures of Annex V (Article 6(1)). An amendment is prepared by the CEP and needs to be approved by the ATCM. Currently, this regime consists of 73 ASPAs and seven ASMAs that have been designated by the ATCM.11
Before examining the use of the ASPAs and ASMAs for marine spatial protection in more detail (Section 3), it should be noted that other components of the Protocol also have great relevance for marine protection.
    • The commitment of the Contracting Parties to the Protocol to establish a "comprehensive protection" relates to the Antarctic environment, including the marine environment south of 60 degrees South Latitude, as well as to the "dependent and associated ecosystems", a term that is relevant for marine ecosystems;
    • The requirements on environmental impact assessment (EIA), laid down in Article 8 of the Protocol and Annex I, apply to all activities under Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty,12 including activities in the marine area of the Antarctic Treaty area with the exception of those activities regulated by the  ICRW and the CAMLR Convention. In practice, since the entry into force of the Protocol in 1998, approximately 40 IEEs have been submitted to the AT Secretariat EIA database addressing research and tourism in the marine environment (accessed 6 January 2014, keyword "marine" results in 28 IEEs) or other activities in the Southern Ocean, such as monitoring or maritime surveillance (accessed 15 February 2014, keyword "Southern Ocean" results in 12 IEEs). 
    • Annex II on the conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna applies also to native mammals and birds (Annex II, Article 1), which spend part of their life cycle on land;
    • Annex III on waste disposal and waste management applies also to activities as defined by Article VII(5) (see above); and it contains specific provisions regarding the disposal of sewage, domestic liquid wastes and other liquid wastes onto sea ice (Article 4(2)), the disposal of waste at sea (Article 5), as well as provisions concerning waste management on ships.
    • Annex IV on the prevention of marine pollution contains provisions that apply to any ship ("a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment") in the Antarctic Treaty area. The Annex prohibits the discharge of oil (Article 3), the discharge of into the sea of any noxious liquid substance, and any other chemical or other substances, in quantities or concentrations that are harmful to the marine environment (Article 4), and prohibits the disposal into the sea of all plastics, including but not limited to synthetic ropes, synthetic fishing nets, and plastic garbage bags (Article 5). For the purpose of marine spatial protection, Arts. 5(3) and 6(1) are of particular interest: disposal of food waste and the discharge of sewage are not allowed within 12 nautical miles from land or ice shelves (does not apply to sea ice), albeit allowed beyond this boundary. Consequently, Arts. 5 and 6 establish a "buffer zone" of marine spatial protection around the ice free areas and ice shelves of the Antarctic continent and adjacent islands. This "buffer zone" is protected from the disposal of food waste and discharges of sewage. In implementing the provisions of this Annex, due consideration must be given to the need to avoid detrimental effects on dependent and associated ecosystems outside the Antarctic Treaty area (Article 8). Even in cases of vessels with sovereign immunity, to which the Annex does not apply, each Party shall take into account the importance of protecting the Antarctic environment (Article 11(2). In view of the definitions in the Annex (e.g., "ship") and the aims of the Annex, it is clear that the provisions of this Annex also apply to fishing operations;
    • Annex VI on liability arising from environmental emergencies applies to environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area which relate to scientific research programmes, tourism and all other governmental and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area for which advance notice is required under Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty, including associated logistic support activities. It applies to all tourist vessels that enter the Antarctic Treaty area. It also applies to environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area which relate to other vessels and activities as may be decided in accordance with Article 13 on amendment or modification (which could theoretically include, in the future, fishing vessels).
An examination of ATCM instruments in the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat database indicates that the ATCM has adopted a considerable number of instruments on marine- and maritime-related issues (keywords e.g. "marine", " southern Ocean", and "CCAMLR", accessed January-February 2014), with the highest number of instruments on issues of area protection and management; exchange of information; marine living resources, including IUU fishing; marine research, including in the achievement of ATCP status; and tourism. Most of these will not be discussed here, but underscore the interest of the ATCM on a range of issues concerning the Southern Ocean.
Finally, the 2001 Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (one of the regional treaties under the global Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species) aims to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for albatrosses and petrels, the habitat and range of which may be south of 60 degrees South Latitude. The Agreement itself does not contain elements of marine spatial protection and will not be discussed here.
2.3	Competence related arrangements between ATCM and CCAMLR
In discussing marine spatial protection, it is important to note that, in principle, the CAMLR Convention and the Antarctic Treaty, including the Protocol, have separate aims and regulate different activities, although the aims and regulations are interrelated in various ways. The objective of the CAMLR Convention "is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources" (Article II (1)) in which "conservation includes rational use" (Art II (2)), with any harvesting subject to several major conservation principles (Article II (3) a-c). Harvesting and associated activities in the CAMLR Convention area (roughly south of the Antarctic convergence) are regulated in the Convention itself (e.g., principles) and through conservation measures (CMs) and resolutions adopted by the CCAMLR. Such conservation measures may include area-based management tools under Article IX(2)(f) and, particularly, Article IX(2)(g) of the Convention. The Protocol aims at the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems (including the marine environment) and its provisions as well as the instruments adopted by the ATCM under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty relate (unless the provisions or instruments stipulate otherwise) to all activities south of 60 degrees South Latitude. The Final Act to the XIth SATCM in 1991 makes clear that "nothing in the Protocol shall derogate from the rights and obligations of Parties" under the CAMLR Convention, the CCAS and the ICRW. 
The Final Act also states that, "with respect to the activities referred to in Article 8 [EIA], […] it was not intended that those activities should include activities undertaken in the Antarctic Treaty area” pursuant to the CAMLR Convention or CCAS.13 Although beyond the scope of this Information Paper, comparable "interface" issues emerged during discussions concerning the review of Annex II on the Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna, where a major issue was related to the scope of the revised Annex, i.e. whether it should address all Antarctic living organisms.14 In other words, concerns were expressed about the issue of "marine species" and whether such species can then be afforded "Specially Protected Species" status.15 As noted by SCAR in 2002:
There would seem to be a substantive opportunity as the Annex is presently drafted to include any marine species within those elements from which they are not specifically excluded. The inclusion of any species warranting protection from either marine or terrestrial realms makes scientific sense, but may run counter to what is believed to be current jurisdictional responsibilities. 16 (emphasis added)
A revised version of Annex II was eventually adopted in 2009, but the revised version had the same scope as the original version.
Thus, while there certain differences between these various instruments (e.g., aims, regulated activities and geographical scope), the instruments are also interrelated and the aims of the separate systems also require effective collaboration and mutual respect.This extends to Contracting Parties of the CAMLR Convention which are not Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.17 For example, it is important that, in developing conservation measures, CCAMLR takes account of the ATCM measures under Article IX. This has been codified in Article IX(5) of the CAMLR Convention:
The Commission shall take full account of any relevant measures or regulations established or recommended by the Consultative Meetings pursuant to Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty […] in order that there shall be no inconsistency between the rights and obligations of a Contracting Party under such regulations or measures and conservation measures which may be adopted by the Commission.18
It may also be desirable that the CCAMLR more directly draws attention to ATCM measures through its conservation measures. A particular important example is CM 91-02, which provides: 
Each Contracting Party shall ensure that their fishing vessels licensed in accordance with CM 10-02 are aware of the location and relevant management plan of all designated ASMAs and ASPAs which include marine areas listed in Annex 91-02/A. 
Conversely, the ATCM must also take account of the work, expertise and competences of the CCAMLR. For instance, Article 6 (1) of Annex V to the Protocol requires the ATCM to forward proposed management plans for ASMAs and ASPAs to the CEP, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and, "as appropriate", to the CCAMLR. In addition, the CEP shall take into account any comments provided by the SCAR and, "as appropriate", by the CCAMLR. Furthermore, Article 6(2) of Annex V to the Protocol states that no marine area shall be designated as an ASPA or ASMA without the "prior approval" of the CCAMLR. In accordance with Article 5(1) of Annex V, the CCAMLR may also take the initiative to propose an area for designation as an ASPA or ASMA by submitting a proposed management plan to the ATCM. Decision 9 (2005) provides more clarity on the interpretation of this provision. It states: 
    1. "That for the purpose of the implementation of Article 6.2 of the Environmental Protocol, draft management plans that contain marine areas which require a prior approval of CCAMLR are those: 
        a) in which there is actual harvesting or potential capability of harvesting of marine living resources which might be affected by site designation; or 
        b) for which there are provisions specified in a draft management plan which might prevent or restrict CCAMLR related activities. 
    2. That proposals for designations of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas or Antarctic Specially Managed Areas which meet the criteria of Paragraph 1 above shall be submitted to CCAMLR for its consideration before any decision is taken on the proposal relating to marine areas. 
    3. Furthermore that any other proposed designations which might have implications for CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP) sites shall also be submitted to CCAMLR for its consideration."19
This approach has been applauded by CCAMLR20- whose membership, it should be noted, overlaps substantially with that of the ATCM:21 "The Commission agreed that the provision of advice from CCAMLR to the ATCM, in order that such advice could be included in decision-making, was consistent with the spirit of cooperation and harmonisation between CCAMLR and the ATCM."22 This is also the main message of Resolution 1 (2006), in which the ATCM underscored the importance of the CAMLR Convention as an integral part of the ATS and "encourage[d] increased cooperation at the practical level" between the ATCM and CCAMLR.
Application of legal instruments of the ATS: Current status of marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area
As shown above (subsection 2.2),  the ATCM has accepted a special responsibility for marine protection since the early 1960s, and various instruments for marine spatial protection have been developed to implement this responsibility. However, to what extent have these instruments been applied in practice? This section provides an overview, distinguishing between the instruments under the CCAS and CCAMLR (subsection 3.1) and the ASMA and ASPA instruments under Annex V to the Protocol (subsection 3.2). A further distinction is made between the ASMAs and ASPAs with a marine component that have been reviewed by the CCAMLR under Decision 9 (2005), and those that have not.
Maps 1-3 (Appendix I) provide an overview of the extent in which legal instruments under the CCAS, the CCAMLR, and the Protocol have been applied to marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area. The maps show marine areas that have been protected under these legal instruments. It should be noted that different kinds of marine spatial protection afford different kinds of protection regarding particular values or uses, as relevant to the various legal instruments. These marine areas are described further below.


        3.1 Marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area: Implementing the CCAS and CCAMLR
Under the CCAS, three seal reserves have been designated in the South Orkney Islands, the SW Ross Sea, and Edisto Inlet, which are seal breeding areas or sites of long-term scientific research (Map 1). The SW Ross Sea seal reserve is substantially larger than the other two.
Under the CAMLR Convention, the following measures have been taken:23 
    • Responding to concerns that activities at some sites, used as part of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) sites, may interfere with the collection of important monitoring data, the CCAMLR introduced a conservation measure to provide protection to CEMP sites. This was originally CM 18/IX (1990), which has since become CM 91-01 (2004). Two sites were afforded protection through this instrument between 1991 and 2000, but this protection was not extended thereafter. There are currently no protected sites under CM 91-01 (2004), but many of the currently active CEMP sites south of 60 degrees South Latitude are within ASPAs or ASMAs, and are therefore given additional protection through those instruments.24 
    • The CCAMLR has also adopted CM 91-02 (2012) Protection of the values of Antarctic Specially Managed and Protected Areas, which requires that each Contracting Party shall ensure that their licensed fishing vessels are aware of the location and relevant management plan of all designated ASMAs and ASPAs, including those ASMAs and ASPAs for which management plans have previously been approved by the CCAMLR in accordance with ATCM Decision 9 (2005).
    • In 2004, the CCAMLR began to address the topic of MPAs, and over the years made progress through a number of workshops, the adoption of the first MPA in the South Orkney Islands southern shelf in 2009 (CM 91-03 (2009)), and the approval in 2011 of a general framework for the establishment of MPAs under the CAMLR Convention (CM 91-04 (2011)). The CCAMLR is currently discussing additional MPA proposals for East Antarctica and the Ross Sea, both of which are entirely located south of 60 degrees South Latitude. 

        3.2 Marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area: Implementing the Protocol
There are currently seven ASMAs and 73 ASPAs designated under the Protocol.25 These areas can be categorised on the basis of their location (inland, coastal and/or marine); the values they aim to protect (relative to the terrestrial and/or marine ecosystems); and whether or not they meet the criteria set out by Decision 9 (2005) Marine Protected Areas and other areas of interest to CCAMLR. On the basis of these criteria, the following five categories have been identified (Maps 1-3): 
    1. ASMAs/ASPAs with a marine component that meet the criteria of Decision 9 (2005), and that required approval by the CCAMLR prior to their adoption by the ATCM;26
    2. ASMAs/ASPAs with a small marine components that do not meet the criteria of Decision 9 (2005), and that did not require approval by the CCAMLR prior to their adoption by the ATCM;27 
    3. Coastal ASMAs/ASPAs (with no marine component) protecting marine values on land (e.g. native birds and mammals that spend part of their life cycles on land);28 
    4. Coastal ASMAs/ASPAs (with no marine component) protecting terrestrial values (e.g. terrestrial flora and fauna, lakes, geological features, historical remains, etc.); and
    5. Inland ASMAs/ASPAs.
As shown in Table 1, three ASMAs and 11 ASPAs contain a marine component so that the management plans for these areas required approval by the CCAMLR prior to their adoption by the ATCM in accordance with Decision 9 (2005). 
The subsection below examines some of the key elements of management plans for ASMAs and ASPAs with a marine component. The analysis focuses primarily on those aspects of the management plan that have a specific marine spatial protection component, and does not include more generic aspects. The management plans of these ASMAs and ASPAs include a range of elements of marine protection, albeit less specifically from a marine spatial perspective. In many instances, the marine protection component is generic to the whole ASMA or ASPA and, for ASPAs, refers to permit conditions. Next, a brief overview is provided of other protected areas under Annex V of the Protocol that afford some level of protection to small marine areas.
3.2.1	ASMAs/ASPAs reviewed by CCAMLR
The three ASMAs adopted with the approval of CCAMLR (ASMAs 1, 4 and 7) have a marine component ranging from approximately 30-90% (Table 1). In broad terms, the management plans for these ASMAs aim to conserve and protect the environment of the areas by managing the variety of activities and interests in the areas. The ASMAs also aim, inter alia, to protect breeding seabird populations and associated research. The ASMAs also contain ASPAs. The key values of these ASMAs include:
    • Representative of the terrestrial, limnic, coastal, near-shore, pelagic, and fjord-bottom ecosystems, with diverse and continuous scientific activities undertaken in the Area for many years (ASMA 1);
    • An active volcano with an exceptionally important floral assemblage, including many unique features; one of the world’s largest colonies of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica); and a benthic habitat of ecological interest due to the natural perturbations caused by volcanic activity. (ASMA 4). The area offers the rare opportunity to study the effects of environmental change on an ecosystem, and the dynamics of the ecosystem as it recovers from natural disturbance; and 
    • One of the most biologically diverse in Antarctica, with numerous species of bryophytes, lichens, birds, marine mammals and invertebrates, an important foraging area for birds, seals and cetaceans (ASMA 7). Diverse and easily accessible assemblages of marine and terrestrial flora and fauna in this area are particularly valuable for science, with some datasets spanning the past 100 years and intensive scientific interest beginning in the 1950s.
The marine spatial protection component within the ASMAs is small in ASMAs 1 and 4, and is represented by either shallow marine areas or as part of a small ASPA. Access to these areas to ships or other vessels is not restricted, but some guidelines for research, anchoring, etc., are provided in order to avoid or minimize disturbance of wildlife, benthic habitats, or interference with on-going research. ASMA 7 has a much larger surface area than the other two ASMAs, much of which is a marine area. With regards to the marine environment, ASMA 7 explicitly aims to ensure that any marine harvesting activities are coordinated with scientific research and other activities taking place within the ASMA. ASMA 7 is also a CEMP site. Its marine spatial protection component consists of restricted zones (a number of islands), including a buffer extending 50 m from the shore into any adjacent marine area. In order to protect sensitive bird colonies throughout the breeding season, access to the restricted zones between 1 October to 15 April is restricted to those conducting essential scientific research, monitoring or maintenance. 
The 11 ASPAs adopted with the approval of the CCAMLR have a marine component ranging from approximately 30-100%. The largest is over 1,000 km2, but several of them are under 1 km2 (Table 1). 
Key values of these ASPAs include:
    • The most southerly established Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony known (ASPA 121); 
    • Small areas of benthic habitat of exceptional ecological interest in different substrates, including an active volcanic seabed (ASPAs 144, 145 and 146);
    • Antarctic fur seal and penguin breeding colonies and krill fisheries within the foraging range of these species make for a critical site for ecosystem monitoring and a CEMP site (ASPA 149). The area includes the largest fur seal colony in the Antarctic Peninsula region, and one of the longest continuous Antarctic fur seal monitoring programmes;
    • An area representative of the terrestrial, limnological and littoral habitats of the maritime Antarctic, including rich lichen flora, and two native flowering plants, twelve species of birds, and large numbers of elephant seals and fur seals in a minimally disturbed area (ASPA 151);
    • Only two known sites in the vicinity of Palmer Station suitable for bottom trawling for fish and other benthic organisms, offering unique opportunities to study the composition, structure, and dynamics of several accessible marine communities (ASPAs 152 and 153);
    • Important littoral area for well-established and long-term scientific investigations, with a high diversity at both species and community levels (ASPA 161);
    • A terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem among the most outstanding in northern Victoria Land, with a near-shore marine environment being a representative example of the sea-ice habitat used by breeding Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) to give birth and wean pups early in the summer season (ASPA 165). This is also a CEMP site focusing on population monitoring, reproductive success, feeding and foraging strategies, migration, and behaviour; and
    • One of the largest emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica breeding on sea ice, with approximately 20,000 breeding pairs, comprising approximately eight percent of the global emperor population, and ~21% of the population in the Ross Sea, an extended record of observations, and exceptional value for observations of the interactions and predator-prey relationships between many different members of the marine ecosystem (ASPA 173).
These various ASPAs have several specific marine protection components, some of which are defined in terms of marine spatial protection:
    • The marine component of ASPA 121 consists of the marine environment up to 500 meters from the shoreline immediately adjacent to a penguin colony. The management plan requires to avoid access to the colony via the primary access route of the penguins to the colony, which could otherwise be subjected to unnecessary disturbance. 
    • Free passage of ships is allowed in most ASPAs, except in a restricted zone (see below). 
    • As noted above, in several ASPAs, the marine protection component is generic and included in the ASPA's permit conditions. In these instances, there are no specific restrictions on routes of access to or movement within the ASPA, although movements should be kept to the minimum necessary consistent with the objectives of any permitted activity. Spatially located marine spatial protection requirements include preferred locations for boat access, landings, and anchoring. 
    • In some instances, in which the benthic habitat is protected, the marine protection component includes a request to avoid waste dumping from ships, bottom hauling and sitting of bottom devices, as well as anchoring except in compelling circumstances.
    • In a particular sensitive area (ASPA 161), anchoring is prohibited, and crew or other people on small boats or ships are prohibited from moving beyond the immediate vicinity of their vessel, unless specifically authorized by a permit. Visitors are requested to take special precautions against marine pollution, including the release or spillage of hydrocarbons from ships, and biological introductions. 
    • In ASPA 175, access to a restricted zone of 62.5 km2, that encompasses the primary breeding area for emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) and which is considered the most ecologically sensitive part of the ASPA, should be for compelling reasons that cannot be served elsewhere within the ASPA. There are also temporal and spatial restrictions for access to the ASPA by ship or small boat, which require a permit. Ships are prohibited in the restricted zone. 
    • Harvesting is not specifically mentioned in any of the ASPA management plans, with two exceptions: 
    • ASPA 161, which states that "No marine resource harvesting has been, is currently, or is planned to be, conducted within the Area, nor in the immediate surrounding vicinity"; and
    • ASPA 165, which notes that the research in the ASPA "...is important to broader studies of how natural and human-induced variations in the Antarctic ecosystem may affect the breeding success of Adélie penguins, and to understand the potential impact of harvesting of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)." 
The activities that are or may be conducted in the ASMAs and ASPAs vary slightly among the various ASMAs and ASPAs, including restrictions of time or place, but generally includes several of the following:
    • Scientific research that will not jeopardize the values of the area, with varying degrees of "compelling purpose" requirements depending on the case and greater restrictions for ASPAs than ASMAs, including in some instances research associated with the CEMP;
    • Logistic support associated to scientific research;
    • Essential operational activities of vessels in order to facilitate science and other activities, including tourism, or for access to sites outside the area;
    • Harvesting of marine living resources, subject to some requirements;29
    • Management activities including, inter alia, monitoring and inspection, maintenance or removal of facilities, clean up of abandoned worksites, restoration of historic sites, and monitoring the implementation of the management plan;
    • Activities for educational or outreach purpose;
    • Media, arts or other official national program visits; and
    • Visitation for tourism or recreation.
All ASMAs and ASPAs discussed here are designated for an indefinite period, except for ASPAs 144, 145 and 146. These ASPAs were initially designated as SSSIs in Recommendation XIV-5 (1987). These three sites were re-designated as ASPAs in Decision 1 (2002). After earlier extensions of their duration, the management plans for these three areas are currently under review.
The examples above illustrate, inter alia, the diversity of ASMAs and ASPAs with a marine component meeting the conditions of Decision 9 (2005), the various values that require protection, and the specific marine protection requirements within the areas according to their management plans. As in many other instances in Antarctic environmental management, this is not a case of "one size fits all".
3.2.2	ASMAs/ASPAs and other sites not reviewed by CCAMLR
Besides those listed above, most other coastal ASMAs and ASPAs protect above water areas, which may include breeding areas for seabirds and seals, or concentrations of these animals, but not the marine environment itself. There are a number other instances of ASPAs that afford some level of protection to small marine areas, including:
    • Some ASPAs have buffer zones extending 10-100m around islands. These areas include ASPAs 109, 110, 111, 115 and 117.
    • Some ASPAs protect groups of islands or rocks that are important for penguin populations, and protect the fast ice around these areas, when present, but not the marine environment itself. These areas include ASPAs 105, 120 and 124. 
    • In contrast to the example above, in ASPA 107 Emperor Island, the designated area (approximately 3 km2) comprises Emperor Island and the marine environment (including sea ice when present) within 1,000 m of the coastline of Emperor Island. The site contains an isolated colony of emperor penguins of  outstanding scientific interest, and one of only two colonies of this species in which breeding occurs on land. The 1,000m boundary is set as a precautionary limit to avoid disturbance to breeding emperor penguins. Within this zone, landing and overflight restrictions apply to aircraft during the period from 1 April to 15 December. However, the area does not include the terrestrial areas of several islands nearby.
    • Some ASPAs contain a marine component, but have not been reviewed by CCAMLR as they did not require CCAMLR approval under ATCM Decision 9 (2005). These areas include ASPAs 102, 107, 116 and 169.
    • ASMA 3 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land, East Antarctica, has been established because of its historic, archaeological, social and aesthetic values. It includes a marine component in Boat Harbour. 
    • ASMA 6 Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, covers an ice-free area of 40 km2 representing a significant biogeographical location, and exhibiting associated environmental, scientific and logistical value. The ice-free area consists of two major peninsulas (Stornes and Broknes), four minor peninsulas, and approximately 130 near-shore islands. The ASMA comprises the ice-free area and near-shore islands collectively known as the Larsemann Hills, and the adjacent plateau. The ASMA includes the land within a polygon that includes the nearby islands, but not the marine environment.
Any marine area may be designated as an ASMAs or ASPAs. In turn, both ASPAs30 and ASMAs31 may also contain sites or monuments of recognised historic value. This is, for instance, the case of ASPA 155 Cape Evans, Ross Island; ASPA 157 Backdoor Bay, Ross Island; and ASMA 3, Cape Denison, East Antarctica. Although the Protocol's Annex V, Article 8 on historic sites and monuments, does not explicitly refer to marine areas, it would be conceptually possible to have historic sites or monuments that are underwater or that have otherwise a marine component. In practice, there is only one instance at present:
    • Historic Monument 74 protects the south-west coast of Elephant Island between the southern side of Mensa Bay and Cape Lookout, including all of the foreshore and intertidal areas, in which the wreckage of a large wooden sailing ship has been found (Maps 1 and 2).

Comparing the ATCM’s responsibility for marine protection and the application of legal instruments for marine spatial protection 
Section 2 examined the ATCM's responsibility for the establishment of marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area. Section 3 examined the actual outputs of ATCM on this matter, in the form of a series of ASMAs and ASPAs with a marine component. Section 3 also examined briefly marine spatial protection established under other components of the ATS. This section contrasts the legal responsibilities of the ATCM with its outputs, as discussed in the two previous sections. The overarching issue is whether legal responsibilities have been fully implemented or, alternatively, some elements have been "lost" in the transition from theory to practice.
Through the practical implementation of legal obligations for marine protection, there has been a series of rich discussions concerning how legal instruments should be implemented (what could be called "the theory of the practice"). There have also been useful discussions about concrete proposals for marine spatial protection through the use of ASMAs and ASPAs (what could be called "the practice of the theory"). In these discussions, some conceptual progress has been made concerning, inter alia, the delineation of the respective roles of the ATCM and CCAMLR in marine spatial protection. However, different perspectives on the protection of marine areas by the ATCM have also come to light, so that not all proposals on the table resulted in concrete outputs. Key elements of these discussions will be summarised below.32
In terms of concrete progress:
    • The importance of establishing marine spatial protection has been highlighted as an important agenda item for the CEP and the ATCM (and also the CCAMLR);
    • The CEP and the CCAMLR have discussed the implementation of Article 6 (2) of Annex V and Decision 9 (2005) (e.g., CEP V, 2002; announcements on SC-CAMLR in CEP VII, 2004; CEP X, 2007; and first Joint SC-CAMLR/CEP Workshop, 2009); 
    • Statements have been made on "the need to establish a representative network of marine and terrestrial protected areas" (e.g., workshop Antarctica’s Future Environmental Challenges in 2006);
    • The "Commitment to increased cooperation at a practical level between ATCM and CCAMLR" was codified in ATCM Resolution 1, 2006;
    • Management plans were developed and approved for concrete marine ASPAs,. It may be noted that “The Committee noted that ASPA No.152 and ASPA No.153 would be the first solely marine ASPAs designated since Annex V entered into force, and that this was a significant and welcome development in the Antarctic protected area system.”33
    • Various relevant workshop were organised by the CCAMLR and/or the CEP, including workshop on Marine Protected Areas in Silver Spring (2005); workshop on bioregionalisation in Brussels (2007); first joint SC-CAMLR/CEP Workshop in Baltimore (2009); and CEP Workshop on Marine and Terrestrial Antarctic Specially Managed Areas in Montevideo (2011). While much of this work was primarily focused on the separate work of the CCAMLR on marine spatial protection, it helped to inform the work of the ATCM/CEP;
    • Throughout this work, the importance of developing a harmonized approach to protecting the marine environment across the Southern Ocean was highlighted by the CEP and by the CCAMLR (e.g., CEP IX, 2006; first Joint SC-CAMLR/CEP Workshop 2009; and special MPA workshop in Brest, 2012);
    • Initiatives have been undertaken for "a bioregionalisation of the Southern Ocean, with the aim of providing a scientific basis for identifying representative areas for protection" (e.g., CEP IX, 2006), discussion on selection criteria for marine protected areas at CEP X, 2007, referring this work to the Environmental Domains Analysis at CEP XI, 2008, and CEP XII, 2009;
    • The first Joint SC-CAMLR/CEP Workshop (2009) discussed a range of issues concerning the adoption of marine protected areas, and concluded that "Issues relating to spatial protection and management of Antarctic marine biodiversity would generally be best led by the Scientific Committee of the CCAMLR. However, this does not preclude in any way the development by the CEP of ASMAs and ASPAs which have in whole or in part a marine component.";34
    • The CEP agreed at its 2009 meeting to:35 
    • develop a strategy and work towards the establishment of an effective, representative and coherent spatial protection of marine biodiversity within the Antarctic Treaty area within the next three years through the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) under Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection;
    • cooperate as far as possible with CCAMLR and SCAR to ensure that such measures are implemented on a scientific basis, and with the aim of achieving harmonized protection for Antarctic marine biodiversity across the Antarctic Treaty system; and 
    • focus further work on the development of marine spatial protection and management within, but not limited to, those priority areas agreed by CCAMLR which fall within the Antarctic Treaty area (Appendix 4 to the CEP Report, Part I, section 2, page 157).
    • In 2011, the CEP Workshop on Marine and Terrestrial Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, which took place in Montevideo, noted that "ASMAs can be, and have been, designated in the marine environment and application of the ASMA mechanism should be considered in the CEP’s ongoing efforts to engage in and support work led by SC-CAMLR to develop a network of Antarctic marine protected areas."
    • In 2011, the CEP "recalled its previous agreement to engage constructively with CCAMLR on these matters".36 At that meeting, 
CCAMLR informed that it had agreed on a work plan towards creation of the MPA network by the 2012 target date. The first milestone of the proposed work plan is for Members to collate relevant data for the 11 priority areas and others as appropriate and characterize each region in terms of biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes, physical environmental features. The second milestone is the special MPA workshop this coming August in Brest, France.37
    • Subsequently, the option of having ASMAs and ASPAs within marine protected areas under the CAMLR Convention has explicitly been acknowledged at the special MPA workshop in Brest in 2012;38 and
    • At recent CEP meetings, concerns have been expressed and discussed in relation to events of harvesting within some marine ASMAs and ASPAs.39  
This overview makes clear that marine spatial protection in Antarctica has been the subject of useful discussions of the CEP and other bodies. However, it is also clear that establishing marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area has proven to be a relatively slow process, and that concrete progress for spatial marine protection has been limited. 
As shown in Table 2, 29% of the ASMAs and 26% of the ASPAs have marine values (e.g. native fauna, near-shore environment) that could have been included within the boundaries of the specially managed or protected area, but in practice were excluded. Rather, these sites have no marine component and can be categorised as "Coastal areas with no marine component containing marine values on land". Sites of this kind occur continent wide (Map 1) and in particular in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions (Maps 2 and 3). It should be noted that a number of these protected areas were initially adopted before the meetings of the CEP began.
Table 2 also shows that 23% of the ASPAs have not been reviewed by the CCAMLR, because they have a small marine component that does not meet the criteria of Decision 9 (2005). Furthermore, six of the 11 ASPAs that have a marine component meeting the criteria of Decision 9 (2005) have an area of less than 10 km2 - and in fact four of those have an area of less than 1 km2. In brief, marine spatial protection adopted by the ATCM/CEP has consisted so far of relatively few and small areas. As a whole, all ASMAs and ASPAs reviewed under Decision 9 (2005) cover approximately 6,100 km2 with a marine component of approximately 5,300 km2 (data in Table 1). This contrasts with, for instance, the South Orkney marine protected area of 94,000km2 established under the CAMLR Convention. 
Furthermore, some discussions at the ATCM/CEP could have resulted in the adoption of proposals for broader marine spatial protection but eventually did not. For instance, ASPA 104, Sabrina Island in the Balleny Islands, was originally Specially Protected Area (SPA) 4, designated in 1966 and described as "A small island some 2 kilometres south of Buckle Island in the Balleny Islands."40 A 1999 proposal submitted to CEP II suggested the SPA to be enlarged to include other Balleny Islands together with "...the surrounding marine area out to a distance of 12 nautical miles surrounding the islands"41 on the grounds that "the designation of an enlarged SPA is considered necessary to protect the unique and special ecological, scientific and aesthetic values of the area and to establish an archipelagic SPA in the Ross Sea region."42 CEP II noted that "New Zealand announced that it intends to put forward a management plan to SCAR, CCAMLR, and the Parties in due course. Several members offered to provide further feedback to New Zealand."43
At CEP III in 2000, New Zealand provided an update on the proposal, noting that it was:
...a "first" for the Antarctic Treaty system in that it incorporates significant marine and terrestrial areas on a scale so far unseen in the Antarctic. The concept of integrated protection of land and marine interactions at a site of outstanding biodiversity is central to the proposal and should be recognised in the way on which the draft plan is being considered.44 
The proposal was discussed in some detail at CEP III,45 which noted that "Close co-ordination between the ATCM, the CEP and CCAMLR is needed to ensure harmonisation of measures aimed at conserving Antarctic marine living resources and  protecting the Antarctic environment." 46 The enlarged SPA proposal was adopted in 2009, comprising "all of Sabrina Island above sea level, including the Monolith, and Chinstrap Islet"47 but excluding the surrounding marine area. 
Since the limited coverage of the marine environment under Annex V appears to be an issue of implementation rather than an absence of responsibility by the ATCM/CEP, it would appear that the ATCM/CEP are perceived by some Consultative Parties as having a limited role in promoting marine spatial protection. This may be illustrated by comments made during the recent CEP XVI meeting in Brussels in 2013. During this meeting Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands submitted ATCM XXXVI/WP 49, including a draft resolution supporting the work of the CCAMLR on marine protected areas. The working paper noted the work carried out so far towards the establishment of a representative system of marine protected areas in the CAMLR Convention area, and invited the CEP to acknowledge this work and encourage its prompt and positive conclusion.48 Certain interventions made during the discussions appear to be based on an assumption amongst at least a number of Consultative Parties that the CEP (and ATCM) have in practice a limited role to play in marine spatial protection.49 For instance, during the discussion of WP049, one of the CEP members recalled "the 2009 CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop, which concluded that issues relating to spatial protection and management of Antarctic marine biodiversity were generally best led by SC-CAMLR at this time, and considered that it was appropriate for the CEP to express its support for the ongoing work within CCAMLR."50 Two Members "emphasised that CCAMLR was responsible for considering issues not addressed by the ATCM, such as the rational use of marine living resources, and it was important for the CEP to remain within its mandate in any discussions of this".51 Eventually, while the CEP welcomed CCAMLR’s on-going work on marine protected areas, it was unable to reach agreement on the text of a resolution.52
The ATCM itself has not made much progress in expanding marine spatial protection in the Antarctic. One of the reasons is that, as noted above, the progress in the CEP in terms of concrete proposals for the ATCM has been limited. Also, it should be noted that since the CEP began to meet, most discussions concerning marine spatial protection took place in the CEP rather than in the ATCM. Nonetheless, when the issue was raised in the ATCM, consensus was not achieved. 
For instance, in 2011, Belgium and the United Kingdom submitted XXXIV ATCM WP44 rev.1, entitled Complementary protection for Marine Protected Areas designated by CCAMLR. The working paper noted that, in 2009, the CCAMLR had approved the designation of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf as its first large-scale marine protected area.53 CCAMLR CM 91-03 (2009) defines the boundaries of the area and the provisions for fishery-related activities that are to be managed there. These provisions include a prohibition of discharges and dumping of any type of waste by all fishing vessels when present in the designated area. The working paper proposed a mechanism for this provision to also be applied to all non-fishing vessels when present in the designated area, as well as co-ordinating the recommendations for scientific activities and transiting vessels with those adopted by the CCAMLR. The paper also proposed one option to streamline future joint work of the ATCM and CCAMLR in respect of the designation of a network of marine protected areas by 2012. 
During discussions of XXXIV ATCM WP44 rev.1 in the ATCM, concerns were expressed about a range of issues, including interference with IMO processes, issues of stakeholder consultation vis-à-vis the tourism industry prior to the adoption of an instrument affecting non-fishing vessels, and lack of prior advise on the topic by the CEP.54 In addition, Japan noted that the Protocol provides for the designation of an ASPA or ASMA, and that this was the statutory basis for the designation of any area for environmental protection by the ATCM, emphasising also that there was no definition of a "marine protected area" in the Antarctic Treaty or the Protocol. 55 Consequently, Japan stated that any consideration by the ATCM should be based on such legal basis and "expressed deep concern that the proposed Measure would be a significant deviation from the statute and practice governing the ATCM." 56 Eventually, there was no agreement enabling the proposal to be adopted. Nonetheless, some Parties "... urged the ATCM to recognise the need for a streamlined approach on the designation of MPAs within the Treaty system."57
The examples above underscore that marine spatial protection using the instruments of the Annex V in coastal or marine areas has so far been more limited than what it could have been: some conceptual progress has been made on "the theory of the practice", but "the practice of the theory" has faced some opposition that has impeded more substantive outputs. In part, this results from the need of further harmonisation of the work of the ATCM/CEP and the CCAMLR vis-à-vis marine spatial protection. 
Conclusions
The overview of formal responsibilities outlined in earlier sections makes clear that, from the start of the ATS, the ATCM has adopted a formal responsibility for the preservation and conservation of living resources58 and the broader environment south of 60 degrees South Latitude, including the marine environment. Already in 1964, with the adoption of the Agreed Measures, the ATCM designated the Antarctic as a special conservation area and established the instrument of designating areas as specially protected areas. This instrument also applied to the marine environment south of 60 degrees South Latitude. Since these early times, through the adoption of the CCAS, the CAMLR Convention and the Protocol, various other instruments have been developed to protect the marine environment, including tools for marine spatial protection. As far as the Protocol is concerned, these instruments include the prohibition of discharges of oil and noxious liquid substances in the Antarctic Treaty area, the prohibition of food waste disposal and sewage discharge within 12 nautical miles from land or ice shelves, and the possibility to designate ASMAs and ASPAs for marine areas or areas with a combination of terrestrial and marine components. Particularly since the 1980s, it was also made explicit that the ATCM responsibility includes the responsibility to prevent adverse impacts on dependent and associated ecosystems north of the 60 degrees South Latitude (see, e.g., Recommendation XIII-4 (Brussels 1985) and Recommendation XV-1 (Paris 1989)).
In principle, the CAMLR Convention and the Antarctic Treaty, including its Protocol, have separate aims and regulate different activities. Nonetheless, as the aims, interests and instruments are interrelated, various arrangements have been developed to clarify and delineate the competences of particularly the CCAMLR and the ATCM, and to promote the strengthening of collaboration. These arrangements make clear that designating marine areas or areas with a marine component as ASMAs and ASPAs is the full competence of the ATCM, although prior approval by the CCAMLR is required in situations where harvesting might be affected or provisions in the management plan might prevent or restrict CAMLR Convention related activities. 
It has also been explained that Annex V, Article 3 (2) of the Protocol makes clear that designating ASPAs is not just a competence, but rather an obligation for the Contracting Parties to the Protocol: "Parties shall seek to identify, within a systematic environmental-geographical framework, and to include in the series of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas: […] (b) representative examples of major terrestrial, including glacial and aquatic, ecosystems and marine ecosystems." Furthermore, Annex V, Article 3 (2) lists nine categories of areas that should be covered by such series of ASPAs. This obligation does not affect in any way the capacity of the CCAMLR to designate marine protected areas under CM 91-04 (2011), and various instruments may also be applied in an integrated manner to strengthen the overall protection of the marine environment. For instance, the option of having ASMAs and ASPAs within marine protected areas under the CAMLR Convention has explicitly been acknowledged at the special MPA workshop in Brest in 2012.
ATS instruments that have been applied to afford marine spatial protection in the Antarctic include:
    • Generic and specific protection of the marine environment;
    • Regulations on sealing, including the designation of three seal reserves, one of which is particularly large;
    • The conservation of marine living resources in the Antarctic Treaty area and the CCAMLR area, including rational use, with harvesting is subject to important conservation principles. Of particular significance is the designation under the CAMLR Convention of the South Orkney marine protected area with a surface area of 94,000 km2, with further proposals for new marine protected areas being discussed in the context of CM 91-04 (2011);
    • The disposal of food waste and the discharge of sewage within 12 nautical miles from ice-free areas and ice shelves, and beyond;
    • 13 specially managed or protected areas with a marine component, some of which are also CEMP sites, totalling about 6,100 km2  (including 5,300 km2 of the marine environment);
    • 17 ASMAs/ASPAs with a small marine component, and 
    • 21 coastal ASMAs/ASPAs protecting marine values on land (but excluding the marine environment itself). 
Additional protection is afforded within the Antarctic Treaty area with regards to particular activities or species under a range of international conventions, including the MARPOL 73/78, ICRW, IMO, and ACAP.
Overall, there has been progress towards achieving marine spatial protection in the Antarctic Treaty area, but the analysis in Section 3 shows that it has been a slow process, with some conceptual agreements as well as disagreements, particularly on practical matters. Eleven ASPAs have a marine component meeting the criteria of Decision 9 (2005), although seven of these areas have an area of less than 10 km2 and four of these less than1 km2. Furthermore, 29% of the ASMAs and 26% of the ASPAs have marine values (e.g. native fauna, near-shore environment) that could have been included within the boundaries of the specially managed or protected area, but in practice were excluded. 
Some valuable steps have been taken towards greater harmonisation between the work of the CCAMLR and the CEP/ATCM on marine spatial protection, including CEMP sites protected as ASMAs or ASPAs; the option of designating ASMAs and ASPAs with a marine component adopted by the ATCM in accordance with Annex V, Article 6, of the Protocol (and Decision 9 (2005)); and, potentially, the option of having ASMAs and ASPAs within marine protected areas established under the CAMLR Convention. However, it appears that these steps have not yet resulted in the ATCM protecting marine areas south of 60 degrees South of Latitude, including to address activities not covered by the CAMLR Convention, beyond what has been described in this document.
Nonetheless, there is a general understanding that further harmonisation of the various bodies of the ATS on marine spatial protection would be helpful. Further progress on this issue would require, on the one hand, that the CEP revisits its 2009 objectives for the protection of marine biodiversity and makes concrete proposals to the ATCM, as well as further consultation between the ATCM/CEP, CCAMLR, and SCAR to identify any outstanding issues of concern. These and related actions may eventually enable the ATCM to fulfil its role in protecting the marine environment in the Antarctic Treaty area.
