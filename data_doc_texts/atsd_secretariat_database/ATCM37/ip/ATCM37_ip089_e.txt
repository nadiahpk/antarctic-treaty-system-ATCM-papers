An account of optional activities offered by the Antarctic tour operators that operated through Ushuaia during the 2013-2014 Austral summer season


Summary
This paper presents a description of optional activities offered by Antarctic tour operators that operated through Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 Austral summer season, in order to know the range of the offer in the Antarctic Peninsula.
Introduction
The activities offered by tour operators to enjoy different experiences in visit areas have varied throughout the span of more than 55 years of tourist voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula. These activities have been adapting to the availability of different resources, passengers’ motivations, and the measures, decisions and resolutions adopted by the ATCMs and actions by the tour operators through IAATO in order to mitigate the impact on the ecosystem and allow the commercial activity to continue.
Tourist expedition vessels offer the possibility to access remote destination regions, which do not have any facilities or equipment, whilst they satisfy passengers’ needs on board. The smaller vessels can do coastal navigation and access different places to walk or hike, visit historic sites and research stations, watch the landscape and its different components: geological features, flora, fauna, etc., also including the “polar plunge” on several occasions. 
In order to know the alternative activities offered during the 2013/2014 season by Antarctic tour operators that organized voyages to the Antarctic Treaty Area operating through Ushuaia, itineraries published by tour operators1 (25), inward and outward clearance documentation2 and ATS documents available at the Web Site, particularly the EIAs, were used.

Proposed alternative activities in the Antarctic Peninsula, Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) for the 2013-2014 season
The following activities were offered during this last season:

    • Camping
    • Kayaking (in some case at night)
    • Mountaineering
    • Climbing, ice climbing or ice trekking
    • Skiing, cross-country skiing
    • Snowshoeing 
    • Snorkeling
    • Diving
In 121 voyages alternative activities were offered on board 12 different vessels, organized by 10 tour operators. It is important to point out that from the beginning of the season3 on November 2nd 2013 up to March 15th 2014, 211 voyages were made by 29 vessels.
Most of the times these alternative activities are offered as optional activities, in many cases they involve an additional cost and the number of spaces is limited, and not always clearly specified.
A tour operator offers a “base camp”, defined as a temporary onshore spot from which passengers do a number of activities while the vessel stays at a specific location to provide them with support. Thus passengers are allowed more time ashore than usual for mountaineering, hiking, photography, camping, kayaking, etc
In Table 1 the activities which were offered during the 2013/2014 season can be seen, identifying the number of vessels on which the activity was offered, the number of voyages and the potential number of passengers that could perform the activities.
