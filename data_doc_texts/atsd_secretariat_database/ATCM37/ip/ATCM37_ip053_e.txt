Implementation of Annex VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: A South African update

Information Paper submitted by South Africa

Summary
Bearing in mind Decision 4 (2010), as well as Article 13, paragraph 3, of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol), which calls upon the Parties to notify all other Parties of the measures taken to ensure compliance with the Protocol, South Africa can report on the progress made as follows: 

Information on progress
South Africa adopted Annex VI on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies at ATCM XXVIII in Stockholm on the 17 June 2005. The long process of ratification of Annex VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also referred to as the Liability Annex) is finally gaining some momentum. The Annex was presented to, discussed and finally approved in the last quarter of last year, by the South African Parliaments Cabinet Committee, the Portfolio Committee, the National Assembly (12 November 2013) and finally the National Council of Provinces (21 November 2013). An Instrument of Ratification has been submitted to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) for submission to the Depository.  


Way forward 
The next step is to amend South Africa’s Antarctic Treaties Act No. 60 of 1996 accordingly, and promulgate the appropriate Regulations to the Act for the Madrid Protocol and all of its Annexes to enter into force and give effect thereto. Simultaneously, the formalization and development of a permitting system will be established.
