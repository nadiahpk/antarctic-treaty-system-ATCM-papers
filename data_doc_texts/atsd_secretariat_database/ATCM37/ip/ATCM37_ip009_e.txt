An action plan for the Brazilian Antarctic science
 over the next 10 years

Scientific advances over the first thirty years of the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) demonstrated the importance of the region to the South American environment. Although Antarctic science has greatly developed in Brazil, there are still many gaps in knowledge on polar processes affecting the Brazilian territory and its people. Bearing that in mind, the Brazilian Government, through its Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), has developed a Plan of Action where priority investigation areas were divided in five thematic research programs. All these programs prioritize the exploration of connections between Antarctica and South American environments, with an emphasis on processes that affect the Brazilian territory.
The first program ("The role of the cryosphere in Earth system and its interactions with South America") focuses on investigating the role of the Antarctic Region in the Southern Hemisphere climate, with an emphasis on the South American continent and the evolution of biogeochemical processes along the last twelve thousand years. This program includes the setting of the National Ice Core Laboratory.
Selected program objectives
• 	To investigate the connections between the Antarctic atmosphere-cryosphere-ocean coupled system with meteorological and climatic processes in South America and the South Atlantic.
• 	To explore the effects of anthropic activities and their influence on the atmospheric chemistry of the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes.
• 	To investigate the relation between the Antarctic sea ice extent variability with the Southern Hemisphere climatic evolution during the past12,000 years.
The "Effects of climate change on the biocomplexity of the Antarctic ecosystem and its connections with South America" program investigates the origin and evolution of Antarctic biodiversity, its distribution and relation between organisms and the environment, through long-term interdisciplinary research in terrestrial and marine environments, contributing to the understanding of the biological connections between Antarctica and South America. It pays special attention to the consequences of regional and global climate change.
Selected program objectives
    • To investigate the evolution, current patterns of distribution, abundance, and adaptations of biodiversity to the polar environment and its connections to South America.
    • To assess the presence of invasive species and their potential effects on Antarctic communities.
    • To evaluate, biochemically, the molecular components of the Antarctic food chain to understand the dynamics of essential precursors for the regional marine life.
The third program, "Climate change and vulnerabilities in the Southern Ocean", is designed to investigate physical and biogeochemical processes associated with changes in the Southern Ocean circulation and its interactions with the sea ice and ice shelves that may impact on the Brazilian and South Atlantic climate. 
Selected program objectives
    • To monitor the variability of the Southern Ocean component of the Meridional Overturning Circulation.
    • To investigate the role of the oceans in the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and the consequences for the sea level rise.
    • To investigate the sea ice cover variability in the Southern Ocean.
A fourth program, "Geodynamics and geological history of Antarctica and its relations with South America", integrates geoscientific studies to understand the mechanisms that led to the current geographical configuration of Antarctica, since the fragmentation of the Gondwana continent, its isolation and environmental consequences resulting from tectonic, paleogeographic and climatic changes occurring over geologic time.
Selected program objectives
    • To investigate the disintegration of the Gondwana supercontinent and the geological partitioning of Antarctica during the South Atlantic opening process.
    • To characterize the tectonic, stratigraphic, paleobiogeographical, paleooceanographic, paleontological and sedimentological signature of Antarctica in the evolution of the South Atlantic, from its opening to the present day, the modifications of connections between the Southern Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.
Finally, the fifth program addresses the "Dynamics of the upper atmosphere in Antarctica, geospace interactions and connections with South America", investigating the dynamics and chemistry of the upper atmosphere and the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on the Antarctic climate and associated ecosystems. It will also consider the effects of the Sun-Earth interactions and impacts of high-energy astrophysical phenomena.
Selected program objectives
    • To investigate the dynamics and chemistry of the upper atmosphere of Antarctica and its water vapour content to subsidize climate forecast models and to understand its connections with South America.
    • To investigate the role of the ozone layer depletion in the Antarctic and South American atmosphere.
