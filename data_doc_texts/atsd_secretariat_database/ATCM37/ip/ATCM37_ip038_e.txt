Proposed Long-Term Environmental Monitoring at Bharati Station (LTEM-BS)

Abstract
Bharati station, established by India in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, was formally made operational on the 18th March 2012.  The new research station is environment-friendly and provides a state-of-the-art platform to the scientific community to carry out research activities in the frontier realms of polar sciences. This paper describes the proposed Environmental Monitoring of the Station and its environs to be initiated as a long-term program.

Background
Bharati station (69O 24’ 24” S, 76O 11’ 43” E) established by India at the Larsemann Hills of East Antarctica, is located within the Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 6, designated so under Measure 2, in 2007.
Under Articles 3and 8 of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (“Madrid Protocol”), Article 5 of Annex-1and Resolutions XV-1, XV-5, XVII-1and XVIII-2  it is necessary to assess and monitor the impacts of the ongoing activities at the station environs as well as to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment prior to the execution of any new scientific or logistics activity at the site.
Environmental monitoring at the site started prior to the construction of the station, and continued during and after construction of the station complex.  The Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation Document of Bharati station undertaken by India, reiterates the commitment to carry out systematic and regular environmental monitoring of the station environs to assess the impacts if any, of the post-construction activities at the site.  Considering that the Stornes peninsula situated leeward of the site of station is due for designation of ASPA, a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme of the peninsula is also planned.  

The envisaged long-term environmental monitoring programme is also aimed at elucidating the anthropogenic impacts if any, on the ecology of the area, for developing a management plan to fine-tune the existing systems. The results from the monitoring would also be useful for decisions making processes related to remedial measures, where needed.

The Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Antarctica, prepared by COMNAP shall be referred while the detailed methodology is developed for environmental monitoring.

Collaboration
Other interested Parties are welcome to collaborate in the planned environmental monitoring programme at Bharati station. Students from college, University and research institutes will be given an opportunity to collaborate on this project, as well as to develop their own projects under the Student Participation Scheme of the Annual Indian Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica. 

Scope of Monitoring
The National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR), India’s nodal agency for the Antarctic Programme has decided to undertake the comprehensive environmental monitoring programme of Bharati station and its environs, with clearly-spelt out objectives which shall ensure achievable results. The monitoring programme will cover the area in and around the Bharati station, and Grovnes, Broknes, and Stornes peninsulas, the McLeod Island, Fisher Island, Quilty Bay, Thala Fjord, and Brattnevet peninsula. 

Objectives
After an exhaustive review of all relevant documents, and taking into consideration the studies already carried out in the area by Australia, Belgium, United Kingdom, Russia and China, and pursuant to the discussions at a brain storming held at NCAOR in February 2013, the following goals have been set to assess the impact of human activities on the environment around the station:
    • To demonstrate the compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protocol
    • To capture the information that may show environmental changes / impacts around the Bharati Station arising from field activities
    • To undertake the monitoring for a period of five years before conducting a major review of the programme
    • To utilise the existing equipment, station personnel and scientists as much as possible without appointing additional staff
    • To ensure that the monitoring information is used as a part of management decisions

Role and Responsibility
Director NCAOR and the Environmental Officer would be overall responsible for designing and implementing the Environmental Monitoring Programme at Bharati Station.

Environmental Features and Indicators

Footprints
Building area and associated modules’ area indicated in final CEE of the station. Additional footprints covered due to any new installations, scientific activities etc. would be noted and reported on. Efforts will be directed towards minimising the footprints.  

Air Quality
The sole sources of local contamination include blown dust, pollution from exhaust emissions and incineration, and isolated contamination events associated with human presence in Antarctica. Research findings show that chemical contamination is long-lived in Antarctica. Therefore, the air quality studies would be aimed at:
    • measurement of SO2, NOX, CO, PM, VOCs, CH4 from the emissions of various engines (power station, vehicles etc.) 
    • ambient monitoring of black carbon, PM, SO2, CH4 and NOx 

Microbial Study
It would be appropriate to identify the microbes which are of human origin or have been accidently introduced into the environment and which are responsible for the environmental degradation, to augment our understanding of the biology of Antarctic microorganisms. For assessing the extent of environmental pollutants introduced into the soil, lake or marine environment, and to evaluate their response, it is planned to evaluate the biodiversity of microbes present in this unusual environment through a study of:
    • microbial ecology to understand the bacteria of human origin, by molecular methods,  DNA amplification technique and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
    • the Total Coliform and E.coli.in Lake and Sea water column
    • the abundance and distribution of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in soil  
    • the microbial contamination (non-native species) by collecting samples of  dust, equipment and fibres from clothing, human waste, shed human skin cells, and 
    • the spatial extent of moss, lichen and measurement of heavy metals and PAH.

Lake Environment
Monitoring of the Lake Environment aims to decipher the various biogeochemical processes. Biogeochemical process-attributes for the transport, immobilization, and mineralization of nutrients and other chemicals provide the linkages between the local biota and the physical environment.  Current patterns of biological activity and diversity reflect past and present distributions of water, nutrients, organic carbon, and biota.  It is therefore proposed to adopt following studies:
    • loading of nutrients into the lakes during summer flow (total phosphorus, dissolved reactive phosphorus,  N-NH4, N-NO2, N-NO3)
    • chlorophyll-a and primary phytoplankton production
    • monitoring meltwater flows on surface and subsurface (piezometers in active layer), conductivity, pH, DO
    • study of  heterotrophic microbial activity
    • abundance and distribution of  micro zooplankton and phytoplankton

Land Environment
Soil microbiota mediates most processes such as decomposition, soil respiration, uptake and fixation of micro- and macronutrients, and detoxification of heavy metals. To assess the anthropogenic impacts, the following will be studied:
    • studies on the concentration of persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl and pesticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, in soil and lichen samples
    • assessment of hydrocarbons (TPH, PAH),  heavy metals
    • Metals, TPH, particulates from snow samples

Marine Environment
In the months succeeding the austral summer, a burst of biological productivity occurs, both under the ice and in the lake bottom. Any discharge into the marine environment may change the relevant abiotic and biotic factors. Surface sediments and sediment cores will be retrieved for carrying out the following studies: 
    • effect of wastewater discharge on marine water through study of pathogens, total coliform, E. Coli, nutrients, demand, trace metal analysis in surface and subsurface water
    • Study of  benthos
    • measurement of  salinity, TSS, DO, BOD, COD, pH, conductivity and other physicochemical parameters

Noise Environment
Sound arises from activities in the water, on land or in the air from the operation of vessels, small boats, aircraft, and equipment or from individuals or groups of people. Noise may affect local wildlife habitat as well as individuals.  It is planned to monitor:
    • Day-Night noise levels at different locations in and around Bharati station. 
    • noise levels and its frequency distribution for different machinery, helicopter, ship during operation at Bharati station


Variable Site Information and Data
To enhance our understanding of few more parameters which may contribute to developing an environmental management plan, it is also planned to collect information on:
    • weather and other environmental conditions (sea ice extent, cloud cover, snow cover, temperature, wind direction and speed)
    • biological variables (number of occupied nests, number of chicks per occupied nest, ages of chicks), and the nature and extent of any observed impacts, breeding population size (nest counts) and breeding success (number of chicks produced per occupied nest),
    • seal haul-out and wallow locations, and discrete groups of breeding penguins and flying birds
    • fuel handling (amount consumed, number of spills, size and location of spills)
    • aircraft/vehicle operations (distance travelled, number of landings, fuel consumed)
    • solid and liquid waste (waste types (including hazard), volume / weight)

Station Activity
It is noted that residents of Antarctic stations have an effect of cognitive performance with alteration in seasonal pattern. Sewage waste and ‘grey water’ originate from station toilets, laundry facilities, accommodation and cooking areas and may contain faeces, urine and associated nutrients, microorganisms (including potential pathogens), organic material (toilet paper and food waste), detergents, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and desalination plant brine. It has been planned to collect samples periodically and study the following:
    • salinity, TSS, DO, BOD, COD, pH, conductivity, faecal coliforms, and heavy metals in drinking water
    • waste water assessment (TSS, DO, BOD, COD, pH, conductivity, faecal coliforms, heavy metals, volume)
    • fuel consumption per machinery
    • oil spill and contingency plan
    • EIA/permit compliance (Number of breaches recorded)

Sampling Method and Statistical Design
It has been decided to collect the same number of replicate samples at each time from the same location. These locations will be randomly allocated so as to not to introduce any bias into the study. As far as practically possible, composite and stratifies samples will be collected with control on temporal and spatial distribution. Estimation of error and other statistical tools as appropriate shall be applied to achieve desired power.
From sample collection to preservation, transportation and analysis, Standard Operating Procedures as well Standard Methods will be followed.

Implementation, Data Handling and Reporting
NCAOR will be the nodal institute for implementation of the environmental monitoring programme. It is to be noted that baseline data has already been collected prior to establishment of the station and effective indicators have been assessed in order to implement a long term monitoring programme.
Results of the environmental monitoring programmes will be made available to other operators and interested scientists for data comparison and knowledge sharing. The data shall be available at the National Polar Data Centre (NPDC) which is managed by NCAOR. The Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management (JCADM) shall also be approached for data management whenever such need arises.
Reporting shall be achieved in following manner:

    • Publishing in operational and environmental journals or peer-reviewed scientific journals
    • Informing the CEP by means of Information Papers
    • Making information available via COMNAP reporting procedures 
    • Publishing on NCAOR websites
    • Providing relevant information on EIES.
