COMNAP Practical Training Modules:
Module 1 – Environmental Protocol
Introduction
National Antarctic Programs provide a high level of education and training to their personnel, especially to those who deploy to the Antarctic Treaty area. COMNAP has therefore maintained a keen interest in education and training as demonstrated by:
    • the convening of training and education forums and workshops;
    • the establishment of networks (TRAINET and INFONET for example) and expert groups with a focus on education and training;
    • the development of  a web-based library of training material;
    • hosting a web-based discussion forum and document server on training;
    • preparing Information Papers and Working Papers on education and training; and 
    • holding occasional Training Expert Group break-out sessions at Annual General Meetings.
Common training interests
At COMNAP AGM XXV (2013) hosted by KOPRI in Seoul, Republic of Korea, the COMNAP Training Expert Group, led by Veronica Vlasich of  Direccion Nacional del Antartico, met in a break-out session and subsequently identified thirteen areas of common training interest across national Antarctic programs. The group agreed there was strong interest to understand the thematic training areas of others and to share and improve training practices. It was also noted that all national Antarctic programs train in understanding Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol matters and provide instruction or operational and practical guidelines based on the text of both conventions. 

As a result of this discussion the Training Expert Group suggested that those topics could be summarised into a single presentation that would be made freely available to the community for use if they wished.  
Training Module 1: Environmental Protocol
This paper presents (see attachment) a training module (version 1.0) that was been developed by the COMNAP Training Expert Group.  The information was combined from training presentations from the National Antarctic Programs of Argentina, Australia, France and Spain. The presentation is purposefully plain so that National Antarctic Programs or others may add their own branding if they wish. It will be made freely available in various file formats from the COMNAP website. It is intended that this presentation will be kept opened for development and input from all COMNAP members and should evolve to incorporate staff feedback in later versions. 

Suggestions for improvements to this presentation are welcome to be sent at any time to sec@comnap.aq. 
Future work
The COMNAP Training Expert Group intends to consider if there are other topics/themes of common training interest that could be prepared into subsequent training modules which will be shared and made freely available.
