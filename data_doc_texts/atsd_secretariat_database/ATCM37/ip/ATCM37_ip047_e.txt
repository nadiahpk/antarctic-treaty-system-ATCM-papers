International Scientific and Logistic Collaboration in Antarctica








International Scientific and Logistic Collaboration in Antarctica
Introduction
Cooperation as mandated by the Antarctic Treaty is a principle objective of the Parties, of their national Antarctic programs and of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP). There is a wide range of ways in which such cooperation can take place, joint Antarctic facilities being only one such way.
In 1998, COMNAP presented ATCM XXII IP007 (Rev 4) Scientific and Operational Cooperation, and then in 2008, COMNAP presented ATCM XXXI IP092 International Scientific and Logistic Collaboration in Antarctica which demonstrated the significant and high level of cooperation and collaboration which takes place amongst national Antarctic programs.
As a result of ATCM XXXVI discussions, COMNAP offered to provide the ATCM with an update of IP092. In order to do so, COMNAP carried out a new survey on international collaboration in January 2014, the results are presented here.
The 2014 Survey
COMNAP surveyed its 29 member national Antarctic programs and all 29 members responded. While all 29 COMNAP member national Antarctic programs responded to the survey, in some cases they chose not to respond to a particular question, thus the result may be out of less than 29 responses for some questions.
The survey questions were wider than those asked in previous surveys since there is a significant and increasing level of Antarctic-related collaboration which takes place outside of the Antarctic, at home institutes for example, which the previous survey did not capture. Such cooperation often goes unnoticed. The 2014 survey also included two additional questions, noted as “new” in the details comparison of results below. 
Executive Summary
Scientific Collaboration 
To one extent or another every COMNAP member national Antarctic program participates in or provides support for international scientific cooperation in Antarctica and in home institutions.  There are many interrelationships amongst national Antarctic programs with one program working regularly with up to 22 other COMNAP member national Antarctic programs and with as many as five non-COMNAP national Antarctic programs. Since the first COMNAP survey in 1997, there has been an average of 30% increase in international cooperation across all the COMNAP member national Antarctic programs. The scale of international cooperation varies from sharing planning procedures to operating joint stations, joint facilities and joint logistics arrangements.  Some national Antarctic programs have a long and significant record with quantitative statistics which clearly show the number of places offered to international scientists at stations, on vessels and aircraft, and in laboratories in home institutions.  
Logistic Collaboration 
Only two of the 29 COMNAP member national Antarctic programs responded ‘no’ to the question which asked “within the past ten years, has your national Antarctic program shared any facilities with any other national Antarctic program”, meaning 93% of national Antarctic programs shared logistics to one extent or another. All but one (97%) of the programs said they shared Antarctic stations or facilities, with sharing being interpreted in the broadest sense of that word and not limited to jointly run stations, facilities or operations.
More Detailed Comparison of Results
Scientific Collaboration
IP092 (2008) results:
    • Between 5–40% of total number of scientists deployed by a national Antarctic program were from another country;
    • 96% of stations hosted scientists from other nations;
    • 60% expected the number of scientists to increase;
    • 65% expected the number of other countries from which they hosted scientists from to increase.
2014 survey question was: “Within the past ten years, has your national Antarctic program been involved in international scientific collaboration, partnerships or joint research?”
2014 results:
    • 96% answered yes (only 1 of 29 responses said no).
Those that answered yes were then asked “please estimate which percentage of your annual science program is involved in international scientific collaboration, partnerships or joint research.
22 national Antarctic programs responded with an estimate, as follows:
    • 2 100%
    • 2 90%
    • 1 60%
    • 1 40%
    • 3 30%
    • 7 20%
    • 6 10%
National Antarctic programs were then asked to 1) indicate which other programs they had collaborated with and 2) indicate what types of collaboration has taken place. 
Results to 1) were:
    • 1 national Antarctic program indicated they collaborated with scientists from 27 other programs including 5 non-COMNAP national Antarctic programs;
    • 1 national Antarctic program said they collaborated with scientists from 21 other programs;
    • 13 national Antarctic programs said they collaborated with scientists from 11–20 other programs with many indicating that that number included at least 1 non-COMNAP national Antarctic program;
    • 13 national Antarctic programs said they collaborated with scientists from 1–10 other programs with some indicating that number included at least 1 non-COMNAP national Antarctic program;
    • Only 1 national Antarctic program said they did not collaborate with scientists from other programs.
Most cited non-COMNAP national Antarctic programs were from the countries: Malaysia, Canada and Portugal.
General comments included: 
    • More international collaborations could be supported if our currently seasonal station became a year-round station;
    • Many national Antarctic programs noted that their countries used a peer-review process for selection of scientific projects which would receive national Antarctic program support to one extent or another. Such national processes and policies may often require international collaborations or international scientific involvement as one element to be eligible for funding consideration;
    • For ‘smaller’ countries, international collaboration meant scientists could utilise/have access to scientific equipment that their country did not have the capacity to otherwise provide;
    • Initial Antarctic field work may not involve an international team, however, it is not uncommon for projects to develop international collaborations during the course of the research project, especially during the data interpretation and synthesis phase;
    • Funding support often involves student, post-doctoral and scientist exchanges and are always intended to result in shared data and subsequently joint publications. 

National Antarctic programs were then asked to 2) indicate what types of collaboration has taken place. The choices for 2) were:
    • International science exchanges: 92%
    • Student exchanges: 38%
    • Collaboration on academic papers: 91%
    • Other: Carrying out international monitoring/observation  programs; Participation in joint international research programs; Providing scientific equipment; Holding joint science workshops; Equipment deployment (marine and terrestrial) for observation systems; Joint science cruises; Curator training; Funding international scientists; Exchange/use of other national Antarctic program science equipment.
Some programs noted that they are an operations/logistics operator only and that their countries Antarctic science was wide spread across many institutions within their country and that these institutions cooperate with an international partner which, when in the Antarctic, their scientific collaboration was supported by the national Antarctic program.
Facility Sharing
In IP092 (2008), reference to facility-sharing was part of “Scientific Collaboration” (noted above) and also part of the questions asked in regards to “Logistic Collaboration”.  
IP092 results in regards to “Logistic Collaboration”:
    • 35% of national Antarctic programs operated or managed logistic facilities in ‘partnership’ with other nations;
    • 78% of national Antarctic programs provided logistic facilities for other nations;
    • 73% of national Antarctic programs provided transit facilities for other nations;
    • 96% of national Antarctic programs shared ships or aircraft with other nations.
The 2014 survey question was: “Within the past ten years, has your national Antarctic program shared any facilities with any other national Antarctic program”?
2014 results:
    • 93% answered yes (only 2 of 29 responded no) and all but one of those expected the number of “facility sharing partnerships” to increase. 
Those that answered yes were then asked to indicate what facilities were shared. The choices were:
Antarctic facilities shared:
    • Stations: 90% (only 3 indicated no sharing of stations, were “sharing” is broader than jointly run stations like Concordia)
    • Field camps: 62% 
    • Airfields: 52% (14 of 27) 
    • Port facilities: 37% (10 of 27)
    • Other: Refuge/emergency refuge; SCUBA diving facility; Laboratories; Vessels/research vessel laboratories; Shared financial costs for wind turbine, lab (aquarium) facility and zodiac.

Non-Antarctic Facilities shared:
    • Exchanges in home institutions: 41% 
    • Lab space: 45% 
    • Conference facilities: 33%
    • Other: Cargo/equipment storage facilities; Ice core storage and related lab facilities; Port facilities including clearing agents and cargo operations.
The 2014 survey question was: “Within the past ten years, has your national Antarctic program shared any operations/logistics with any other national Antarctic program”?
2014 results:
    • 97% answered yes (only 1 of 29 answered no) and of the yes responses, all but 1 expected the number of operations/logistics sharing partnerships to increase.
Those that answered yes were then asked to indicate what operations were shared. The choices were:
Antarctic operations shared:
    • Aircraft: 89%
    • Vessels: 93% 
    • Land vehicles: 46%
    • Cargo operations: 89%
    • Fuel and/or waste management, including transportation  to/from Antarctica: 86%
    • Medical services: 68%
    • Training programs: 50%  (including joint SAR exercises and programs)
    • Other services: Flight weather forecasting; Environmental joint work; Joint inspection teams; Joint emergency planning and response; Hosting/providing technician support for other program’s scientific equipment; Emergency operations centre; Site selection surveys; Joint dismantling and removal of sites of past activity; Support, including accommodation, for transiting national Antarctic program personnel including scientists; Fire-fighting assistance; Sustainable energy generation infrastructure; Icebreaking services; Technical personnel exchanges (engineer); Aviation ground support.
Non-Antarctic operations shared:
    • Database services:18%
    • Information exchange services: 36%
    • Medical services: 18%
    • Other services: Support in planning; Staff recruitment.

Two New Survey Questions
“New” question 1 asked national Antarctic programs “does your country currently have any country-to-country MOUs (or equivalent) with any other countries in regards to Antarctic cooperation?
Of the 29 national Antarctic programs that responded:
    • 22 (76%) yes (4 of those had Antarctic-related MOUs with non-consultative countries);
    • 5 (17%) no;
    • 2 (7%) did not know.

In regards to this question, several programs noted that collaborative arrangements were not new and the history of country-to-country and national Antarctic program-to-program arrangements went back to the IGY or the early 1960s, so that there is a rich history of scientific cooperation which is not accurately portrayed by a ‘snapshot” survey which only reflects the current situation. 

“New” question 2 asked national Antarctic programs “does your national Antarctic program currently have any MOUs (or equivalent) with any other national Antarctic programs in regards to Antarctic cooperation?
Of the 27 national Antarctic programs that responded:
    • 21 (78%) yes (With almost half mentioning that the MOU was in relation to the DROMLAN arrangement; At least 6 of the 21 national Antarctic programs who said yes had at least one MOU with a non-COMNAP national Antarctic program);
    • 5 (18%) no (1 of those saying it did, however, have an MOU with a non-COMNAP national Antarctic program);
    • 1 (4%) answered “unknown”. 
Conclusions
Joint stations are not the only indicator of international cooperation in Antarctica and may not be the only way to reduce impacts from Antarctic activities. Most Antarctic stations while not run jointly are shared with scientists from other countries.  Such sharing of facilities and provision of support provides the basis for scientific collaboration in Antarctic research.  There are many examples of cooperation across national Antarctic program activity, including significant levels of collaboration and sharing outside of the Antarctic area as shown by the numbers reported above. This is quite satisfying given that fact that there are obvious barriers to international collaboration.  Such barriers include:
    • Variations in organisational structure and annual funding across the range of “small” and “large” national Antarctic programs; 
    • Reduction in annual funding within national Antarctic programs which may limit its ability to host international collaborators or to participate in international science projects; 
    • Disparity between various national policies and objectives; 
    • Lack of country-to-country MOUs on Antarctic matters; 
    • Geography, with regional cooperation more easily manageable then whole of the world or whole of the Antarctic approaches; 
    • Language differences; and
    • Lack of capital investment on Antarctic-related infrastructure.

To overcome such hurdles national efforts are needed.
COMNAP’s Objective to Support International Partnerships
The COMNAP Symposium 2014 entitled “Success through International Cooperation” will highlight recent international cooperative activities in operations, logistics and science and will present success stories and explore barriers to international cooperation.  The COMNAP Symposiums are an every two-year event which are open to anyone. It will, this year, be convened by John Hall (BAS, COMNAP EXCOM Vice-Chair) and will be held on Monday 25 August 2014, Auckland, New Zealand. Details available on the COMNAP website.
