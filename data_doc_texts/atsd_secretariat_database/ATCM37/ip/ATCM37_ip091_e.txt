An update on the Antarctic Polar View sea ice information service

Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The Polar View programme helps enhance the safety and efficiency of vessels operating in the Antarctic by providing up to date sea ice information from satellite imagery. This Information Paper provides an update on the current status of the service and related developments in provision of sea ice information for the Southern Ocean.
Introduction
    • Polar View delivers near real time sea ice information based on satellite observations direct to ships. Information products are created and delivered by a team of international collaborators. This information contributes to improved navigation safety and routing efficiency.
    • The Antarctic Polar View programme was first proposed in 2005 and has been operational since the beginning of the 2006/2007 austral summer season. Initial development and operations were funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).
    • Polar View users in the Antarctic include national programme scientists, resupply ships, tourist vessels, fisheries vessels and rescue coordination centres.
Recent developments
    • The Polar View Antarctic programme has continued to deliver reliable and timely sea ice information since 2005. Despite the loss of the European ENVISAT satellite in 2012, this has included regular provision of high-resolution radar satellite imagery.
    • Related developments funded by the European Commission, including a project called ICEMAR (http://www.icemar.eu), have supported on-going service improvements targeted at enhancing the automatic delivery of sea ice information direct to users on board ships.
    • Polar View has provided support to a number of search and rescue activities in recent years. These operations have benefitted from easier access to sea ice information required by the rescue coordinators. Most recently Polar View provided imagery to a number of vessels involved in the rescue of the MV Akademik Shokalskiy.
    • The European Commission has funded a new activity to further refine operational sea ice information services in the Arctic and Antarctic. The Polar Ice project (http://www.polarview.org/news-press/the-polar-ice-fp7-project-kick-off-meeting) will develop new information products (including sea ice pressure, thickness and forecasts) and improve tools to access and visualise these products.
    • In the last three years, the International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG, https://nsidc.org/noaa/iicwg/), who coordinate the world's ice centres on all matters concerning sea ice and icebergs, has focused attention on Southern Ocean requirements for sea ice information. This includes efforts to improve coordination and cooperation between the national ice services that currently produce Antarctic ice charts (USA, Russia and Norway). The next IICWG meeting, which will focus on Southern Ocean ice charting, will be held from October 20th to 25th in Punta Arenas, Chile.
    • The next European SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite, called Sentinel-1, launched successfully on 3rd April 2014. This satellite, funded by the European Copernicus programme and operated by ESA, will provide a significant improvement in access to satellite radar imagery that is routinely used for sea ice navigation and information in the polar regions. New imagery should become available in the next six months following the satellite commissioning phase (see: http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1_overview).
Conclusions
    • The Polar View Antarctic programme has continued to provide reliable access to sea ice information since 2005 and improvements will result from the new European Polar Ice project.
    • The new European Sentinel-1 satellite will provide improved access to satellite radar imagery for sea ice navigation in the Southern Ocean.
    • The International Ice Charting Working Group will focus attention on improving coordination of Antarctic ice charting activities and Members are encouraged to participate in the 2014 IICWG annual meeting in Punta Arenas, Chile.
