Preliminary report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 Austral summer season 
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2013/2014 Austral summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. Also, it identifies the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the port of Ushuaia, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships. Since the XXXVII ATCM is so close in time, a preliminary report is presented, considering the total of vessels that operated through the port of Ushuaia from the beginning of the season until March 15th 2014, taking into account that the season ends on the 2nd of April when the MV Ushuaia is expected to arrive. 8 more arrivals at the port of Ushuaia are scheduled between the 15th of March and the 2nd of April.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic shipborne tourism, and it concentrates more than the 90% of the worldwide Antarctic tourist activity.   
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend their Antarctic operating schedules.  
With respect to the vessels that operate from Ushuaia, a distinction should be made between those that make landings and those of a much larger size which just sail Antarctic waters without landing passengers. Similarly, a further distinction should be made between those vessels that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia as the port of base from which they run their Antarctic voyages. In general terms, these operations refer to passenger turnaround, port and land services as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist services. Also, at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic season most vessels arrive at the port of Ushuaia and/or depart on a positioning voyage from or towards other destinations.
In order to present the status of Antarctic tourist flows of visitors and vessels in Ushuaia in the 2013/2014 season, data was collected from the manifests1 provided by cruise ships to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority). This information was compared to itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained from enquiries whenever needed. With regard to these sources of information a database is built for each tourist Antarctic season.
This document updates the data given in similar papers presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting since 2009, providing information that may contribute with different aspects of discussions related to the Antarctic tourism issue.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that operated through Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 Austral summer season 
Austral summer season started on November 02nd 2013 when the MV Plancius (Oceanwide Expeditions) departed from Ushuaia to Antarctica, and will finish on April 2rd 2014 with the expected arrival of the MV Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions). Nevertheless, since this is a preliminary report, the season is considered up to March, 15th for the analysis. A total of 2112 voyages run by 29 vessels took place, including the SV Bark Europa and the MY Hanse Explorer and SV Lord Nelson. January was the busiest month as regards the number of Antarctic voyages (29 %) followed by February and December (See Figure 1).

A total of 37.078 visitors went to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 season. Of these, three categories may be identified: a) those that both departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is to say, passengers who were in Ushuaia once either on the arrival or departure- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports (See Table 1). In the first case, passengers were counted only upon departure from Ushuaia. In the second case, several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, and some visited Antarctica as part of the voyage of the beginning or end of the season, and then operated from Ushuaia the rest of the time; in this instance the passengers who arrived at or departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account. Finally, the vessels in transit which voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula were just part of a longer voyage in South America or a more extensive itinerary. Passengers in transit were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the case when calling at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. A distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Therefore, taking into account the average number of passengers on board, it is noticed that 25 vessels were cruise ships that carried up to 500 or fewer passengers whereas 4 vessels carried more than 500 passengers, the latter category transported a total of 9.697 passengers. An average number of crew members and passengers3 as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in Table 2; and in Figure 2 passenger averages per vessel are shown.

Furthermore, 18 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account for 62 % of the total number of vessels. Each vessel made between 7 and 13 voyages to Antarctica, as indicated in Figure 3. It is worth noticing that the MV Ocean Nova (Antarctica XXI), MV Polar Pioneer (Aurora Expeditions) and MS Sea Adventurer (Quark Expeditions), had a different deployment in December, January and February, when they conducted voyages from 25 de Mayo Island, embarking passengers whose arrivals and departures were from Punta Arenas (Chile) by airplane. 

With regard to vessels in transit in Ushuaia, most of them are large cruise ships, which cruise Antarctic waters but do not make passenger landings in Antarctica. As it has been previously stated, these cruise ships are on itineraries round southern South America or on more extensive voyages, and on certain itineraries, they include a visit to Antarctica. Most of these cruise ships run “pendular” voyages along Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3 provides an overview of these cruise ships through Ushuaia including the number of crew and passengers per voyage and indicating if the visit to Antarctica was before or after the port call in Ushuaia.

As regards visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers were counted. In this respect, more than 70 nationalities were identified. Most of the passengers are from the United States, followed by Australia, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Argentina, Russian Federation, Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland, among others. Percentages are presented in Figure 4. 


With regard to Measure 15 (2009), adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one guide every 20 passengers, it has been possible to identify expedition staff members who may be included either on the crew or on the passenger lists. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, staff members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the landing activities. For this reason, only staff members on board vessels that carry up to 500 passengers have been considered. Most voyages, expedition staff is included on the passenger manifest and, in second place, they are included in the crew manifest; in some cases they are listed on both and in other cases staff is not specified (See Table 4). In this respect, it is worth mentioning that their position on board is stated only when they are on the crew manifest.
