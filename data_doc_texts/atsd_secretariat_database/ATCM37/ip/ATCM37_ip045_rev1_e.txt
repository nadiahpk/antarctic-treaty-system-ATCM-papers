IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2013-14 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2014-15 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide estimates of Antarctic tourism from IAATO operators for the 2014-15 season. Due to the timing of ATCM XXXVII, it has not been possible to compile or analyse the statistical data from the Post Visit Reports for the just-concluded 2013-2014 season. However, preliminary numbers indicate that the general picture is similar to that forecast in ATCM XXXVI IP103 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2012-13 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2013-14 Season.   

It is expected that the detailed 2013-14 season information, including details on landing site use will be available in June 2014, and will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under Guidelines and Resources, Tourism Statistics. Where possible, a general indication of information is given in this paper.

Details on anticipated tourism statistics for 2014-15 season can be found in Appendix 2 of this paper. These estimates are based on information provided to IAATO by its operators as of March 17, 2014 at which time we estimate a total of 36,320 tourists for the upcoming season. These numbers reflect only those travelling with IAATO member companies. 
1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
IAATO’s Membership continues to incorporate the majority of private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS passenger ship operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty area are current members of IAATO. All of these operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.

Preliminary estimates and post visit report processing of the 2013-14 season indicates that there will not be a significant difference in the tourism statistics from the 2012-13 season. Ship borne tourism remains dominant on the peninsula and no passengers participated in IAATO operator over-flights to the Antarctic continent. 

1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourism activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, snorkeling, skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays), running events, helicopter operations and underwater ROVs. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. The 2013-14 season however did see the use of overhead ‘drones’ or quadcopters, small remotely operated flight vehicles which can be fitted with cameras for aerial photography. Operators developed guidelines for this new activity, and these guidelines will be tabled at IAATO25.

1.6	IAATO Member-Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels and Yachts

Detailed information of the activities conducted during 2013-14 season will be available in June 2014.  In the meantime, anticipated activities for the 2014-15 season can be found in Appendix 2. All activities are approved or authorized through the Environmental Impact Assessments and Advance Notifications submitted in advance of the season. All activities are intended to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and nearly all activities have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for more than a decade. 

1.7	Commercial Deep Field Tourism 
Three IAATO operators conducted deep field tourism activities during the 2013-14 season. Adventure Network International / Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) – one of the founding members of IAATO in 1991 – conducted activities for the 28th consecutive season; and The Antarctic Company (TAC) operated in Antarctica for the ninth consecutive season and fifth as an IAATO operator. Both ALE and TAC are primary logistic providers.
The third company is White Desert (WDL), which operated in Antarctica for the eighth consecutive season and third as an IAATO operator. Flights and logistics for WDL are coordinated through TAC.
ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and WDL operated out of Cape Town, South Africa.
The three companies employed experienced guides; over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in the field.
 
1.7.1	Visitor & Staff Numbers

1.7.2	Programs and Activities
Data is not yet available. This will be published in June 2014.

1.8	Air / Land Activities conducted by IAATO Members in the Antarctic Peninsula
Data is not yet available. This will be published in June 2014.

1.9	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members

For the 2013-14 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO members.
2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2014-15 Season
Appendix 2 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2014-15 season.
Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats, shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, snorkelling, skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays), helicopter operations, use of remote overhead drones and underwater ROVs.

For the 2014-15 season, those tourism categories where passengers land ashore – traditional small and medium-size expedition ships and yachts, all carrying 500 or fewer passengers – is expected to reach 26,355 passengers, of which numbers in the air-cruise category are estimated to be 1,698. 

Cruise-only tourism, aboard 500-plus passenger vessels with no passengers landing ashore, is expected to reach 9,720 passengers. 

Air-land tourism by the three IAATO Members that provide deep field excursions and expeditions, is projected to reach 470 visitors who will be transported inland during the 2014-15 austral summer.

No over-flights by IAATO operators are expected during the 2014-15 season.

IAATO members will continue to work together so that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that tourism activities have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

3.0 Tourism Trends
A trends chart showing the change in IAATO operator landed passengers, dating from the 1992-1993 season and including estimates for the 2014-15 season, can be found in Appendix 1 of this overview.
