Site Guidelines: mapping update

Information Paper presented by the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia and the United States
Summary
Further to two papers presented at last year’s ATCM in Brussels (ATCM XXXVI WP16 Site Guidelines for i) Orne Harbour and ii) Orne Islands & WP20 On-Site Review of Guidelines for Visitor Sites in the Antarctic Peninsula: summary of programme and suggested amendment to eleven Guidelines) and Resolution 3 (2013), this paper provides an overview of the subsequent activity to improve the maps for those revised and new Site Guidelines. 
Background
In preparing maps for the revised and new Site Guidelines described in WP16 and WP20 and agreed in Resolution 3 (2013) the proponents undertook to ensure that, having undertaken the on-site reviews, the maps themselves were able to support as fully as possible the purpose of the Site Guidelines and to reflect the changes approved by the Parties. 

To achieve this outcome a comprehensive aerial photography programme was carried out by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) during the 2013-14 season. This programme, supported in part by IAATO, has enabled the production of significantly enhanced maps, which more accurately reflect the topography of the locations and which allow for the clearer presentation of key information for visitors. 

As examples of the improved mapping which will be delivered as a result of this programme, the revised map for Brown Bluff and the new map for Orne Harbour are attached at Annex A. Each of the maps for the other Sites referred to in WP16 and WP20 and listed at Annex B will be produced in a similar format and will be fully consistent with, and limited to, the text of the Site Guidelines for Visitors agreed at ATCM XXXVI. 

All of the revised and new maps will be sent to the Secretariat to enable the documents to be fully available on the ATS website well ahead of the start of the forthcoming Antarctic visitor season.
