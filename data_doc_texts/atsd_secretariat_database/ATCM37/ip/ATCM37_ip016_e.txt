Judgment of the Regional Court of Paris dated 6 February 2014 regarding the carrying out of undeclared and unauthorised non-governmental activities in the area of the Treaty and the Damage caused to the Wordie House Hut 
(HSM no 62) 



Judgment of the Regional Court of Paris dated 6 February 2014 regarding the carrying out of undeclared and unauthorised non-governmental activities in the area of the Treaty and the Damage caused to the Wordie House Hut (HSM no 62) 
Information paper presented by France
Summary
The damage caused in 2010 to HSM n°62, the hut known as Wordie House, by a crew member of the yacht the Esprit d’Equipe, has led to the launch of administrative and legal proceedings by the French authorities.
The skipper of the yacht Esprit d’Equipe has been condemned on 6 February 2014 by the Regional Court of Paris to a fine of 10 000 Euros, by virtue of the French Environmental Code, for having undertaken an activity in Antarctica which was not authorised by the relevant and competent national authority. Other legal proceedings in regard to the criminal damage caused to the HSM, however, are still on going. 
The administrative judgment is a historical “first” in French law. We hope that it can serve as a warning and as a legal precedent for all concerned.
This document is a follow-up to WP25, ATCM XXXIII Report of an incident at Wordie House (HSM No. 62) and WP11, ATCM XXXIV Follow-up to the unauthorized presence of French yachts within the Treaty area and damage caused to the hut known as Wordie House - Observations on the consequences of the affair.
Recapitulation of the Event
In January 2010 British operators from the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) alerted the French authorities to the presence in Antarctica of the yacht Esprit d’Equipe, following damage caused to HSM No62 the hut known as Wordie House1 by a French national and crew member of the yacht, which was moored off the site. 
The skipper of the Esprit d’Equipe operates private charters to Antarctica and had not submitted a preliminary environmental impact assessment, either with the competent French authority (TAAF - French Southern and Antarctic Lands) or with any other national authority. Consequently his trip to Antarctica was unauthorised, thereby infringing Article 8 and Annex 1 of the Madrid Protocol. 
French law has implemented Article 8 and Annex 1 of the Madrid Protocol in the French Environmental Code, Articles L. 712-1 and following, and offenders are liable to administrative2 and criminal sanctions.3 
Following this incident an administrative inquiry was launched by the TAAF against the skipper of the Esprit d’Equipe, which led to a warning being issued to him. The TAAF has prohibited him from gaining any access to Antarctica for a period of five years, to last until 31 December. 
Both the warning and the prohibition to apply for any Antarctica activity authorization from France for a period of five years have been published on the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES).4

Cf. WP25, ATCM XXXIII and Measure 4 (1995).
2The French Environmental Code provides that the competent administrative authority (the Préfet of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands) may give a warning to any person who is shown to have carried out activities incompatible with the Madrid Protocol and with French law. All authorizations are then refused for a period of five years (Articles L.713-1 to L.713-4 of the French Environmental Code).
3 Carrying out an unauthorized activity in Antarctica is punishable by imprisonment and fine (Articles L.713-1 to L.713-4 of the French Environmental Code).

At the beginning of 2011, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office informed the French authorities that the Esprit d’Equipe was again seen in Antarctica, with the yacht reported to have put in at Port Lockroy by the UKAHT.5 As a result a new administrative inquiry by the TAAF has been launched.
Legal Proceedings
The TAAF have followed through with the case and presented the administrative reports and their supporting dossiers to the appropriate French jurisdiction, and this process has culminated in the two matters being brought to the Court (wilful damage caused to HSM No62, and the carrying out then repeat offence of an unauthorised activity in Antarctica).
    a) On 6 February 2014 the Court rendered judgment on the matter of the unauthorised presence in Antarctica of the yacht Esprit d’Equipe in 2010 and 2011:  
The skipper of the Esprit d’Equipe was found guilty of having undertaken an activity in Antarctica without any prior authorisation being obtained from a competent national authority. In accordance with Article L.713-5 of the French Environmental Code, he was sanctioned with a fine 10 000 Euros.
However the Court reserved its judgment on the question of the repeat offence, given the lack of clear and tangible evidence. 
The TAAF have made the administrative judgment known through a communiqué published on the TAAF website,6 and have also sent the communiqué to the press as well as to the President of the Travel Agents Union. In accordance with Decision 4 (2012), which requires of all Parties to exchange information, France has also made the judgment known through the EIES,7 with the information included in the section on “Reports in Summary”.
b) in so far as the damage caused to HMS No62 is concerned, a distinct legal procedure has been brought against the crewmember of the yacht and is still underway. 
Conclusions
The judgment reached by the Court in February 2014 constitutes a “first” in French legal history. There is no report that we can see of any incident in the EIES, which is even remotely similar in nature; consequently it appears that the judgment is also without precedent for each and every Party to the Antarctic Treaty. The judgment will, we hope, serve as a warning and as an example for any person tempted to undertake an activity in Antarctica which has not been duly authorised by any competent authority, and we also hope that the judgment will serve as a powerful precedent in the eventuality of any other such incident occurring in the future.
