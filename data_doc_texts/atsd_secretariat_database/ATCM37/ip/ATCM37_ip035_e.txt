COMNAP Waste Water Management Workshop Information
Introduction
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires certain wastes to be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area and for wastes not removed to be managed ‘so as to limit adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems’ (Article 3 – Environmental Principles).

The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) is holding a waste water management workshop in Christchurch, New Zealand in August 2014. The workshop continues waste management discussions held by national Antarctic programs, with COMNAP noting the call made in the report of CEP XV (paragraph 244) for a strengthening of precautionary monitoring of microbial activity in areas near sewage treatment plant discharges, and the CEP's five-year work plan (updated at CEP XVI) that indicates the CEP wishes to develop guidelines for best practice disposal of waste including human waste.
Proposed format
COMNAP’s workshop on the management of Antarctic waste water will be held, as part of the COMNAP Annual General Meeting, on the afternoon of Thursday 28 August 2014. The workshop is being jointly convened by Dr Sandra Potter (Australian Antarctic Division) and Dr Jose Retamales (Instituto Antartico Chileno). 
Sessions are expected to cover:
    • the factors that have led to countries’ current or planned choice of facility;
    • how waste water plants deal with significant increases and decreases in the number of station personnel;
    • treatment technologies with which programs feel they have had success;
    • the need for monitoring and the potential for collaboration (e.g. shared units, monitoring programs); and
    • the costs and benefits of developing systems satisfying Annex II of the Environmental Protocol which calls for precautions to prevent the introduction of microorganisms.
The national programs of Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, India, Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America are among programs that have confirmed that they will present at this event.  All national Antarctic programs are invited to participate in the workshop.
Expected outcomes 
The workshop is expected to generate a body of expert knowledge on the management of waste water at coastal and inland stations and field facilities in Antarctica. A report on the workshop’s findings will be made widely available and will be presented to next year’s CEP meeting. The report is expected to inform any future discussions of Annex III and waste water management by the CEP.
