Contribution of the Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol to the maritime and
environmental protection operations in the Antarctic area
Background Information
The beginnings of the Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol (PANC, acronym
in Spanish) date back to 1998, when the States of Chile and
Argentina determined the need to coordinate the efforts in the
Antarctic areas of responsibility of each Party, established in the
“International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue” of 1979
(SAR Convention), which also considers the cooperation and
coordination among neighbor States.
To do so, the Maritime Search and Rescue Coordinator Centers
under the authority of the Southern Naval Area Command in
Ushuaia (Argentina) and the Command in Chief of the Third Naval
Zone in Punta Arenas (Chile), created the PANC to carry out,
between November 15 and March 15 of each year, search, rescue,
control and pollution fighting activities and exercises, with the aim
of providing safety to navigation, human life at sea, and
contributing to keep waters free from pollution in the Antarctic
Treaty area, to the South of parallel 60°S and meridians 10°W and
131°W.
Thus, since then, the Antarctic Service Ship (BSA, acronym in
Spanish) deploys and stays in Antarctic waters, with maritime
rescue capability and equipped with materials and elements for
pollution fighting. On the other hand, there is another ship
available, which has similar capabilities, the Antarctic Support Ship
(BAA, acronym in Spanish), which stays in its base port ready to
navigate in support of the first ship in case of need.
PANC in the Antarctic Treaty System
Since its creation, the Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol has carried out
its duties within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty System
(ATS), this is why, as Consultative Parties, Chile and Argentina have
included the BSA and BAA information in their respective pre-
season reports, notifying the other Parties of its conformation.
Also, both States have reported permanently to the Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting through the submission of information
documents about the PANC performance, providing details on the
support and rescue activities carried out.
Additional Tasks of the PANC
Besides the main task of the PANC, the Antarctic Service Ship
performs additional activities, which are carried out as possible and
as long as they do not interfere with the Patrol duties. Among
others, it supports navigation, providing weather support to vessels
and ships that navigate in the mentioned area; as weather mobile
station, through the Argentinean and Chilean weather services, it
contributes to the data for the area forecast elaboration; it provides
health assistance, since the PANC units have the capability to
provide low complexity level support with a doctor on board who is
trained to assist emergency cases; it provides support to the
Antarctic scientific community by transporting personnel and/or
scientific equipment from station to station; and finally, it also
provides logistic support through replenishment tasks to own
stations and to stations of other countries.
The previous shows the importance of the tasks that Chile and
Argentina perform during the execution of the Joint Antarctic Naval
Patrol, which is demonstrated in the different emergencies that
have taken place in these 16 years of continuous presence, where it
has provided support to National Antarctic Programs of other States
that are part of the Antarctic Treaty System, as well as support to
fishing vessels and/or tour vessels.
Contributions of the PANC
The Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol has safeguarded the human life at
sea, looked after the safety of navigation, and fought environmental
pollution in a scenario where there has been a sustained increase of
the maritime activities (tour cruises, scientific activities, non-
governmental vessels, logistic chips, fishing vessels, etc.) and a
sustained increase of the air traffic in the area of the Antarctic
Peninsula.
The contribution of the PANC in this SAR area of responsibility
given by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to
Argentina and Chile, lies in that its presence in the area has allowed
decreasing the reaction times in case of an emergency in the
Continent and its adjacent waters, as well as providing a prompt
response in case of an incident that threatens the Antarctic
environment. The organization and continuous actions of this Patrol
have also allowed controlling effectively and immediately the SAR
actions in the area of operations.
Likewise, while strengthening the mutual confidence and friendship
among both countries, it has provided permanent support to the
scientific community, national programs and tour operators.
