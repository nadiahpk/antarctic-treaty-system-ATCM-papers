Non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica via Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 season
Summary
The aim of the present document is to report on the non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 season. Due to the proximity of the XXXVII ATCM, boats that went to Antarctica through Ushuaia were taken into account up to March 15th 2014.
Introduction
In the last few years, maritime tourism to Antarctica has grown up, offering various themes and activities. In this respect, particular interest has been observed in the sector of demand for visits to the Antarctic Peninsula area on board pleasure and/or sport vessels.
Pleasure and/or sport vessels are considered to include any vessel that does not intend to engage in business and is used exclusively for recreation or sporting activities.
The city of Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), situated at the extreme southern tip of South America, possesses, besides a commercial pier, the anchorage of the Fuegian Association for Subaquatic and Nautical Activities where some of the yachts and sailing boats visiting Antarctica during the southern summer season put into port. 
Recalling what were discussed at ACTM XXXVI in relation to yachts and sailing boats visiting the Antarctic Treaty area, we present a report on the non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2013/2014 season. To this end we consulted the documentation of these vessels filed at the Argentina Naval Prefecture, the Argentine Maritime authority. 

Voyages to Antarctica made by pleasure and/or sport boats through Ushuaia
During the 2013/2014 season, 15 pleasure or sport boats went to Antarctica from Ushuaia, transporting 234 persons (See table 1). For this type of vessels, the season started on November 18th with the arrival of SV Selma Expeditions from Antarctica, and finished on February 25th with the arrival of the same boat. Most voyages took place during January.
Among all the sailing vessels mentioned, 11 registers were identified, of which 8 correspond to States that are Consultative Parties of the Antarctic Treaty (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, South Africa) and 3 to States that are not (Antigua and Barbuda, Cayman Islands and Panama) (See Figure 1).
Besides, nationalities of people (crew and passengers) who travelled on board these sailing boats to Antarctica were counted. Most nationalities correspond to Netherlands, followed by Australia, France, Poland, United Kingdom, United States, among others. (Ver Figure 2).
The information presented is a database that allows to identify pleasure and/or sport vessels that made voyages to Antarctica through Ushuaia.
