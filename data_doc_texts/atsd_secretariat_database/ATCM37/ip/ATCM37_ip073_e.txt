New Antarctic stations: Are they justified?
Information Paper submitted by ASOC1
Summary
In 2004 ASOC submitted XXVIII ATCM IP 094, Are more Antarctic stations justified?, which examined new station development in the context of a substantial network of stations and other infrastructure. Ten years later, with several new stations being proposed and few international cooperation initiatives for sharing facilities, it is worth asking the same question again. Building on various assessments in the peer-reviewed literature, this Information Paper contrasts the scientific research output of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties 1980-2004 (in terms of publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals) with the infrastructure that existed in 2004. In practice, there appears to be no substantive relationship between the number of Antarctic stations operated by a particular Party, and that Party's scientific research output. Official inspection reports 2004-2014 seem to corroborate this assessment. In this context, are more new Antarctic stations justified? On the basis of fundamental Antarctic Treaty values of international scientific cooperation and environmental protection the answer would seem to be "not really". A presence in Antarctica may be necessary for research, but stations operated by a single Party are not essential. Consequently, all alternatives to building a new station should be carefully considered beforehand, building on the few examples of successful international cooperation of facility sharing. ASOC makes several practical suggestions to enhance international cooperation, the quantity and quality of science, and reduce environmental impacts.
Background
In 2004 ASOC submitted XXVIII ATCM IP 094, Are more Antarctic stations justified? The paper examined new station development in the context of a substantial network of stations and other infrastructure, and examined what was driving the new station activity in Antarctica, whether or not it was necessary or desirable, and what alternatives there might be.
ASOC concluded that, whilst supporting science initiatives in principle, all alternatives should be carefully considered before deciding to proceed with a new station. Even in those cases, stations should be designed and built with a view to removing them once their life cycle is complete and the scientific returns from being established in a given location begin to decrease. Finally, ASOC warned that the Antarctic Treaty Parties should be wary of a new construction boom that may well turn into a long-term drain on resources and an unjustified impact on the Antarctic wilderness.
Ten years later, with several new stations being proposed, it is worth asking the same question again: Are new Antarctic stations justified? Unlike in XXVIII ATCM IP 094, in this paper we do not examine what are the motivations to build new stations, but we focus on the relationship between stations and scientific research output (in terms of publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals).
Developments since 2004
In 2004, at least five new Antarctic national stations were proposing or planning new stations (Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, India and the Republic of Korea). Other significant infrastructure projects underway at the time included substantial upgrades of existing national stations, the development of air links to various locations in Antarctica and related runways, and an ice road to the South Pole. These developments occurred in a context of at least 73 established stations (whether full year or summer only), maintained by 26 States already operating in the Antarctic Treaty Area2.
Several relevant events have taken place between 2004 and 2014:
    • All but one of the stations planned in 2004 and listed above have been completed or are near completion.
    • Between 2007-2009 the International Polar Year took place. As with earlier IPYs/IGY, this was accompanied by a major scientific effort, linked also to a number of infrastructure projects of different kinds. These included both new infrastructure that was explicitly planned under IPY activities and additional infrastructure that was developed in Antarctica during the same period3. 
    • In 2009 Kunlun Station was built by China at Dome A, an isolated inland location, followed in 2014 by Taishan, a substantial field camp on the road to Zhongshan Station in the coast. The three facilities are joined by a traverse.
    • In 2013, at least one non Consultative Party to the Antarctic Treaty (Turkey) stated its intention to build its own station in due course,4 while another (Colombia) announced its intention to establish a national research programme with an expedition to Antarctica in 2014/20155.
    • In 2014, two states (Belarus and China) submitted CEEs for proposed new stations, both of which will be located nearby one or more other stations, and one of which is in a near-pristine area.
    • 16 CEEs and 81 IEEs were produced since 2004 for the construction/operation of facilities6.
Other developments contributed to stabilise or reduce the human footprint on Antarctica:
    • In 2005 South Africa removed Emergency Base (E-Base).
    • In 2006 the Law-Racoviţă Station was inaugurated at the location of Australia's Law station, originally established in 19867.
    • In 2012 the Dirk Gerritz Laboratory, operated by The Netherlands, was incorporated into the UK's Rothera station8.
    • In 2012 Halley V Research Station (UK) was removed and replaced by Halley VI Research Station.
No other facilities were removed, nor shared facilities created. It is apparent that, on balance, the number of stations and other facilities in Antarctica has increased since 2004 (Fig. 1), including through the occupation of formerly near-pristine sites, following an upwards trend that started in the 1940s-1950s, with a corresponding increase of the human footprint9. Some of the new or proposed stations are of a considerable size by Antarctic standards. The alternative of sharing facilities received only cursory consideration in recent CEEs.
The list of established facilities has been updated by COMNAP in recent years, including some new facilities and also facilities that existed before but were not included in the original list. The updated COMNAP list contains 103 facilities. Of these, 82 are classified as "stations", and the remaining classified as "camps" or "refuges"10. Some of these facilities also include runways of different kinds, and some are joined by maintained roads. 41 of the stations are operated year round, and the remaining only in summer.
Research stations and scientific research output
Infrastructure in Antarctica has continuously increased in the past decades. The number of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties has also increased in the past decades, each of which, in order to be recognised as a Consultative Party, was required to "demonstrate its interest in Antarctica by conducting substantial research activity there"11. In the vast majority of cases this requirement has been met through the establishment of a research station (the notable exception has been, and remains, The Netherlands). However, what has been the impact of infrastructure development on scientific research output? To answer this question, this paper examines three sources looking at scientific research in Antarctica from various perspectives.
Dastidar reviewed productivity and collaboration in Antarctic science. Journal publications on Antarctic science were analysed for the period 1980–2004. A range of analysis techniques were applied to 10,942 records with the word fragment “antarc*” in the title published in 961international, peer-reviewed journals and retrieved from the Science Citation Index database. During those 25 years, productivity increased threefold. The five nations with the highest output were the USA (with 26.7% of the total output), the UK (13.8%), Australia (9.7%), Germany (8.8%) and Italy (6.0%)12.  
Roura examined the relationship between research facilities and scientific research output in Antarctica between 1980 and 2003, on the basis of COMNAP data and an earlier review of Antarctic scientific literature13. In that period, the most productive ATCPs in terms of publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals operated three or four facilities, but so did ATCPs that were (sometimes considerably) less productive. Scientific research output of Parties with no stations was not substantially inferior to those with five or more facilities. 
Dudeney and Walton examined leadership in politics and science within the Antarctic Treaty using counts of policy and scientific papers, to assess the political and scientific research outputs of all ATCPs over the previous 18 years, on the basis of Dastidar14 and Antarctic Treaty Secretariat data. These authors concluded that "...a subset of the original 12 Treaty signatories, consisting of the seven claimant nations, the USA and Russia, not only set the political agenda for the continent but also provide most of the science, with those ATCPs producing the most science generally having the greatest political influence"15.
Building on these various assessments, Figures 2-4 contrast the scientific research output of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties with the infrastructure that existed in 200416. In brief:
    • Fig. 2 includes all facilities by all ATCPs (2004 data) with their scientific research output17 in the period 1980–2004.There is a weak positive linear relationship between infrastructure and scientific research output.
    • Fig. 3 includes all facilities (2004 data) but only listing the ten nations with the highest scientific research output in the period 1980–2004.There is no correlation between infrastructure and scientific research output.
    • Fig. 4 compares all facilities (2004 data) but only listing the nine "most influential" ATCPs as identified by Dudeney and Walton (2012)18. In this case there is a weak negative linear relationship between infrastructure and scientific research output.
It should be noted that the analysis made here refers to infrastructure and scientific research output up to 2004. A comparable analysis for the period to 2014 may well differ somewhat. Factors such as the IPY 2007-2008 would have boosted scientific research output, as well as the development of new infrastructure of different kinds, with associated cumulative impacts19.
To assess scientific activity since 2004, recent official inspections under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol have been examined. Inspection reports since 2004 have remarked on the conduct of research stations ranging from globally significant science at some stations, to limited scientific activity at other stations (Table 2). This Information Paper does not attempt to analyse inspection results in any detail, including with respect to scientific research output. However, inspection reports seem to corroborate that there appears to be no substantive relationship between the presence of Antarctic stations and the conduct of scientific research. 
Discussion
This Information Paper examined scientific research output by individual ATCPs, in terms of publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as it correlates to the number of research facilities operated by that ATCP. The analysis suggests that the correlation between the number of research facilities and scientific research output is not strong. Of course, correlation (or lack of it) does not mean causation. This analysis has limitations including those related to search terms and database searches as they apply to different languages. It is clearly difficult, if not impossible, to analyse the quality of the publications. Nonetheless, the assessment underscores that operating permanent stations is only one of many factors contributing to scientific research output for any particular ATCP. 
It might be assumed that a level of infrastructure helps to carry out Antarctic research (so that one would expect a positive correlation between the number of facilities and scientific research output). As noted by Dudeney and Walton (2012), just because a state meets the requirements to become an ATCP at a particular point in time, including through the establishment of a research station as a demonstration of "substantial scientific research activity", it does not mean that this attainment will be sustained through time20. These authors called for the ATCPs to hold regular international peer reviews of their individual science programmes and to make the results available to the other ATCPs.
In addition, not all research needs to be carried out from permanent land-based facilities - temporary camps, ships and remote sensing are also important contributors to research. Factors such as an increase in the use of remote sensing techniques, would suggest that, if anything, new permanent facilities are less essential than before. Even if permanent research facilities are used, they do not need to be operated by a single nation. A number of examples of international cooperation demonstrate that there are viable alternatives to conduct research that do not require the establishment of new stations. 
The long term commitment of establishing a research station should be taken into consideration before giving a final go ahead. This commitment applies for as long as the facilities are on site, whether operational, temporarily unoccupied, or designated as a historic site. Commitments also result from dealing with the environmental legacy of stations that have been removed, including environmental clean up, remediation, and monitoring, at least for some time after the removal of the station. All these options have implications, inter alia, with respect to the use of human and financial resources, use of logistic assets, and long term environmental management. In the longer run the demands of managing Antarctic stations - at any stage of their life cycles - may impact not only on the intrinsic values of Antarctica, including environmental, scientific, and wilderness values, but also on the availability of resources dedicated to science. 
Overall, operating permanent facilities may serve as useful research platforms for individual Antarctic Treaty Parties, but do not seem to be essential to conduct Antarctic research in the context of a range of options available, and are not in themselves sufficient to acquire influence in the Antarctic Treaty System. Influence in this context results from active engagement in Antarctic research and governance.
Two points are worth noting about the requirement for becoming a Consultative Party, as set out in Article IX, paragraph 2, of the Antarctic Treaty. First, it is not necessary to establish a scientific station; this is mentioned only as one illustrative example of how “substantial research activity” might be conducted. Second, the requirement for “conducting substantial research activity” is not a one-off requirement to be met only at the time of becoming a Consultative Party, but is a continuing requirement for retaining consultative status by acceding Parties.
The ways in which a Party “demonstrates its interest in Antarctica by conducting substantial research there” should now take into account the values and requirements of the Environmental Protocol. Accordingly, efforts to minimise footprint while increasing scientific output, particularly with respect to globally significant science that can only be conducted in Antarctica, should be the benchmark. It should also be recalled that Decision 4 (2005) on Consultative Party Status requires a Party to provide information concerning its activities in the Antarctic, in particular the content and objectives of its scientific programme. It does not require a Party to demonstrate that it has its own station.
Based on the analysis above, all alternatives to building a new station should be carefully considered beforehand, especially the examples of successful international cooperation. It should be emphasised that international cooperation is a two-way street, and that ATCPs active in Antarctica and those aspiring to become ATCPs should both make an effort to facilitate joint ventures. The various alternatives to the traditional model of station operation include, depending on research requirements:
    • Sharing facilities between two or more nations, whether in full partnership or through the establishment of annexes of various kinds;
    • Reusing/recycling of stations or sites, including transferring disused stations to Parties other than the original operator21; 
    • Removing stations once research objectives are completed, which requires stations to be designed and built for eventual removal; 
    • Using mobile platforms such as research ships;
    • Using temporary platforms such as camps, including multi-year camps22; and 
    • Remote sensing.
It should be noted that these alternatives are as valid for prospective ATCPs as they are for current ATCPs, including those that already operate one or more stations.
Closing remarks
New stations continue to be built in the Antarctic, often in near-pristine areas. If the result is increased scientific output, ASOC welcomes this use when carried out in accordance with environmental standards that meet Protocol requirements, or higher. However, just because a station has been built it does not necessarily mean that significant research will be conducted there for the life of the station.
In practice, there appears to be no substantive relationship between the number of Antarctic stations and scientific research output. In this context, are more new Antarctic science stations justified? On the basis of fundamental Antarctic Treaty values of international scientific cooperation and environmental protection the answer would seem to be "not really". Of course, in most instances a presence in Antarctica is necessary for research, but stations operated by a single Party are not essential.  An increase in the number of facilities operated by a single Party does not necessarily mean a greater scientific research output.
Efforts to minimise footprint while increasing scientific output, particularly with respect to globally significant science that can only be conducted in Antarctica, should now be the benchmark for assessing a Party’s interest in Antarctica. 
It should be noted that international cooperation is a two-way street and requires that ATCPs and prospective ATCPs both make tangible efforts to facilitate cooperation with each other, for which there are several viable models.
Based on the above ASOC recommends that the CEP advises the ATCM to support the following initiatives:
    1. That the ATCM should state explicitly that achieving ATCP status, which requires that a Party “demonstrate its interest in Antarctica by conducting substantial research activity there", does not require the construction of new stations, and promote instead alternatives to demonstrate this interest, through alternative arrangements to conduct scientific research that do not require the construction of new stations, thus minimising impacts in keeping with the values of the Environmental Protocol, 
    2. That ATCPs already operating Antarctic stations agree to avoid where possible or minimise further station construction by their own national Antarctic programs; and
    3. That ATCPs agree to carry out regular international peer reviews of their individual science programmes and to make the results available to the other ATCPs and the public.
Taken together, the steps above would not only improve the quantity and quality of science, but would also minimise the environmental impact from research activities, and provide a better justification for the unavoidable impacts that result from the construction and operation of research stations. New (or existing) stations that have a lasting environmental impact but do not contribute substantially to international cooperation and science detract from rather than add to the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty System.

    1. More effort should be made by National Antarctic Programmes to ensure that the research facilities which have been established in Antarctica are actively used; 
    2. Research cooperation between National Antarctic Programmes and between scientific institutions should be pursued more actively;
    3. An assessment of current peer reviewed research should be undertaken for each individual station in the Antarctic Peninsula to be able to establish its impact and contribution to science; 
    4. National Antarctic Programmes should pursue and invest in an approach of more remote and automated measurements for monitoring.

    • Zhongshan Station (China)
    • Bharati Station (India)
    • Syowa Station (Japan)
    • Princess Elisabeth Station (Belgium)

The interrelationship between government and non-government actors at government-owned Antarctic research stations presents a policy issue worth considering.

2011/12
United States & Russian Federation
    • Scott Base (New Zealand)
    • Concordia (France/Italy)
    • Mario Zucchelli Station (Italy)
All three stations visited demonstrated a high level ofc ompliance with the Antarctic Treaty system rules. These stations conduct a wide range of Antarctic scientific research, including terrestrial and marine biology, astronomy, glaciology, oceanography, environmental monitoring, seismology, meteorology and climatology, to name only a few. They also demonstrated
a keen interest in promoting and advancing
international scientific collaboration and have hosted a number of foreign scientists in recent seasons. (p6)
2010/11
Australia
    • Gondwana Station (Germany) (unoccupied)
    • Vostok Station (Russian Federation)
    • Aerial observation of Leningradskaya Station (Russian Federation)(unoccupied)
The team noted that Vostok Station supports numerous scientific projects, in addition to the main drilling activity, demonstrating a commitment to valuable science, under difficult conditions.
2009/10
Australia
    • Syowa Station (Japan)
    • Druzhnaya IV and Soyuz Stations (Russian Federation) (unoccupied)
    • Aerial observation of Molodezhnaya Station (Russian Federation) (unoccupied)
    • Also an ASPA was inspected
Syowa [only  occupied station inspected] has a clear focus on science, in particular atmospheric and upper-atmospheric physics, with numerous antenna arrays supporting long-term experiments. In addition the station supports ongoing programs in geology, biology, oceanography, and geosciences. The Station Leader elaborated on the three themes of Japan’s 6-year science strategy to 2011: Global Warming per se, in relation to the ice cap, and in relation to ocean coupling. Eleven scientists, including 5 meteorology personnel and the Station Leader, had wintered through 2009. 
2009/10
Japan
    • Maitri Station (India)
    • Neumayer Station III (Germany)
    • Novolazarevskaya Station (Russian Federation)
    • Princess Elisabeth Station (Belgium)
    • SANAE IV Base (South Africa)
    • Troll Station (Norway) 
As the campaigns of the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 had wound down, the stations seemed to be focusing on monitoring observations.  At the same time, installation of satellite tracking and data reception systems such as the one by an enterprise owned by private sector and governmental agency (Troll) was steadily advancing as mentioned in (2) above. There were major differences in the level of research and observation facilities among the station. Conventionally, over-wintering observations had been carried out on a limited scale by small numbers of personnel. Recently, efforts have been made to avoid increasing the workload in the field by introducing remote monitoring and remote control, rather than increasing the number of over-wintering personnel. The trend that the inspection team observed is for experts to carry out intensive maintenance work of scientific installations during the summertime, while trained personnel maintain operation during the wintertime (Troll). For this reason, it was observed that securing adequate infrastructure, particularly electric power and space inside the stations for monitoring observation was an urgent issue at the relatively old stations. 

The inspection team found the members of the research projects also quite international (SANAE IV). Field observations appear to be not so active though the inspection team did not have time to investigate this. Conclusion of the IPY is likely the main reason for this. It can be surmised that each country shifted its emphasis from field investigations and observations covering large geographic areas, to research and observations at the stations and their vicinities. It appeared that Princess Elisabeth, opening only in summer, tended to focus on field observations, taking advantage of convenient access to research sites in nearby mountainous areas as well as the monitoring station. 　

It is noteworthy that station installations and heavy machinery are shared and reused on the basis of bilateral agreements, as a part of international cooperation activities (Neumayer III). 
2008/09
Norway
    • Princess Elisabeth Antarctica (Belgium)
    • Halley (United Kingdom)
    • Novo Runway and ALCI Airbase (Russia and ALCI)
The 2009 Norwegian Inspection Team was impressed by the commitment at Halley with respect to maintaining the station as a platform for long-term monitoring and research. The station is obviously a resource intensive station to maintain, both with respect to financial and human resources, and also made obvious by the fact that the sixth station in succession is about to be constructed at the site. The importance of maintaining long-term data series has been made obvious by inter alia the discovery of the ozone hole. The team would like to emphasize the advantages of maintaining such long-term strategic scientific priorities at stations. 

In parallel with a changing focus with respect to ownership, financing and objectives associated with Antarctic science operations, there may be reason to consider closely the implications this may have for strategic research planning in Antarctica. It may be appropriate to consider what driving forces define the research planned for new research stations, i.e. whether there is a long term, coordinated and unique, scientific motive behind, or whether other forces dominate. More private interests involved in Antarctic research and operations may provide for other incentives with regard to scientific priorities. The 2009 Norwegian Inspection Team does not necessarily see this as a significant issue, but notes that changes seem to occur, and that the Antarctic Treaty Parties may want to consider implications at an early stage. 

The inspection team also notes that the number of scientists at the two inspected research stations was low compared to number of people present. Although this can be easily explained for both stations since they were in a period of heavy construction, the inspection team nevertheless perceives that this is a general tendency more often seen in today’s Antarctic operations. Stations are becoming quite resource intensive to operate (also with respect to human capacity), while more and more of the scientific activity is based on remote access to data. Again, this is not seen as a significant issue, but the 2009 Norwegian Inspection Team would like to draw the Parties attention to this perceived general tendency.
2006/07
Sweden, France & New Zealand
    • Amundsen-Scott South Pole (US)
    • Concordia (France-Italy) 
Scientific research of global significance is a priority at Amundsen-Scott South Pole and Concordia stations.

The most striking observation at both Amundsen-Scott South Pole and Concordia stations is the high level of scientific activity that is taking place there. Both stations are strongly driven by science of global significance and seek to address fundamental science questions in astrophysics and cosmology.
2006/07
United States
    • Rothera (United Kingdom)
    • O’Higgins (Chile)
    • German Receiving Station at O’Higgins (Germany)
    • Esperanza (Argentina)
    • Bellingshausen (Russian Federation)
    • Great Wall (People’s Republic of China)
    • Palmer (United States)
    • Field camp at Petermann Island (tour operations)

Several vessels were also inspected.
All station leaders expressed support for scientific research at Antarctic facilities, which is the cornerstone of cooperation among parties to the Antarctic Treaty. In addition, all station personnel spoke of significant cooperation with other stations and Antarctic programs with respect to science, safety, logistics and equipment. It is clear that the stations form part of a community, and this attitude among station managers fosters international cooperation within Antarctica and beyond. 

2005/06

A tourist vessel and several HSMs were also Inspected
Although some stations were undertaking world-class scientific research into a wide variety of disciplines (though many geared to climate change), a larger number of stations appeared to have relatively modest, or even rudimentary, science facilities. This was particularly so when viewed against the substantial size of some stations’ infrastructure. In many situations science programmes appeared to consist of no more than routine data observations involving technicians collecting e.g. meteorological, or tidal measurements. In consequence, stations in close proximity to each other were often collecting similar data on the same parameters.
The Inspection Team believe, in the circumstances, that there would be virtue in SCAR undertaking an audit of science being carried out in Antarctica. Such an assessment might examine issues in-situ such as science priorities, duplication of data collection, as well as identification of areas of scientific research, which need to be strengthened. 

2004/05
Australia
    • McMurdo Station (United States)
    • Scott Base (New Zealand)

A research vessel, several ASPAs and HSMs, and tourist activities on Ross Island were also observed
Both stations are directed at facilitating the conduct of sophisticated scientific research programs on Ross Island and elsewhere in Antarctica, and both stations demonstrate their Governments’ commitment to cooperation under the Antarctic Treaty by actively supporting the operations in Antarctica of other Parties.
