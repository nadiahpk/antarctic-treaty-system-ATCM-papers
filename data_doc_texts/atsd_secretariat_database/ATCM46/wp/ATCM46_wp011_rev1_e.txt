Base Y, Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay – updating information
for HSM 63
Base Y, Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay – updating information
for HSM 63.
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
This paper proposes to update information in the listing of HSM 63,
Base Y, Horseshoe Island, following new survey data captured in
2023. Recalling Resolution 2 (2021) and Decision 1 (2021) the
United Kingdom recommends that the Committee:
recommends the ATCM adopts a Measure (draft at Annex II) to
update the ‘Description’ and ‘Physical features of the environment
and cultural and local context’ information fields of HSM 63.
Background
Base Y on Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay is a former British
scientific base of the late 1950’s, which has an associated refuge hut
‘Blaiklock’ located on Blaiklock Island, was designated an Historic
Site & Monument (HSM) through Measure 4 (1995).
Recent Developments
During 2022-23 season the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage
Trust conducted a survey visit to Blaiklock Island to inspect the
refuge hut and undertake any emergency repairs. During that visit
the location coordinates of the hut were taken using a handheld
GPS, and these deviated from the previously documented
coordinates. Subsequent analysis of satellite data by the British
Antarctic Survey in March 2024 has provided an accurate set of
coordinates for the refuge hut.
The accurate coordinate was derived from orthorectified satellite
imagery and represents the centre of the centre of Blaiklock Hut
roof.  Satellite image: Maxar, WorldView-2, 2019-12-05.  Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) used for orthorectification: Polar Geospatial
Center, Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (Mosaic ID:

Conclusions
Whilst the refuge is a subsidiary structure within HSM 63, its
location is on a different island some 20 miles north of the main site
on Horseshoe Island. We suggest that ensuring the published
information about the HSM is both accurate and up-to-date will
support the understanding and future protection of the site.
Recommendations
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP:
recommends the ATCM adopts a Measure (draft at Annex II) to
update the ‘Description’ and ‘Physical features of the environment
and cultural and local context’ information fields of HSM 63.

Annex II. Draft Measure to update information for HSM 93, Wreck
of Endurance
Measure X (2024)
Revised List of Antarctic Historic Sites and Monuments: Updating
information for HSM 63, Base Y, Horseshoe Island.
The Representatives,
Recalling the requirements of Article 8 of Annex V to the Protocol
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to maintain a
list of current Historic Sites and Monuments (“HSMs”) and that such
sites shall not be damaged, removed or destroyed;
Recalling
Measure 14 (1995), which added the Base Y, Horseshoe Island to
the list of HSMs;
Resolution 2 (2021), which revised the Guide to the Presentation of
Working Papers containing proposals for Antarctic Specially
Protected Areas, Antarctic Specially Managed Areas or Historic Sites
and Monuments; and
Decision 1 (2021), which set out the information contained in fields
that continue to be a formal part of the List of HSMs and that
changes to these fields will require adoption through a Measure;
Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for
approval in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 of Annex V to
the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty:
That the information in the HSM listing for HSM 63, Base Y,
Horseshoe Island, be amended as in the table below:

(xiii) Physical features of the environment and cultural and local
context
The site located on a small isthmus on Sally Cove consists of the
original main building, a weather balloon shed, dog pens and
emergency store. There are two masts on high points near the main
building, and two small wooden boats in a small cove to the north.
Inside, the station contains almost all of its original contents,
fixtures and fittings, including kitchen utensils, stocks of food and
fuel, workshop tools, radio equipment, and a diesel generator. The
excellent condition and completeness of both the buildings and
artefacts are of considerable historical significance; together they
provide a very special time-
capsule of British life and science in the Antarctic during the late
1950s. Historic former science and sledging station now managed
by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust as a heritage site.
www.ukaht.org. The site has a comprehensive conservation
management plan and is actively conserved by a professional
conservation team.
