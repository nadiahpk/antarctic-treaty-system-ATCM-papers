The wreck of Endurance – updating information for HSM 93 and
Prior Assessment of a proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area
in the Weddell Sea
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Chile, New
Zealand, South Africa and United States
Summary
This paper provides an update on the preparation of the
Conservation Management Plan for HSM 93, Wreck of Endurance,
following its discovery on 5 March 2022 by the Endurance22
expedition aboard the South African polar research vessel, S.A.
Agulhas II. Amongst several recommendations proposed in the
management plan the co-sponsors of this Working Paper
recommend that the Committee:
acknowledge the Conservation Management Plan for HSM 93 (see
Attachment A);
recommend the ATCM adopts a Measure (draft at Annex II) to
update the ‘Description’ information field of HSM 93; and
consider the prior assessment (see Attachment B) for a proposed
Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) for the wreck of
Endurance and (1) agree that the values within the proposed ASPA
merit special protection, (2) endorse the development of a
Management Plan for the area, and (3) encourage interested Parties
to work with the proponents informally during the intersessional
period in the development of a Management Plan for potential
submission at CEP 27.
Background
The wreck of the Endurance, the vessel owned and used by Sir
Ernest Shackleton during his 1914-16 Imperial Trans-Antarctic
Expedition and lost in the Weddell Sea in 1915, was designated a
Historic Site & Monument (HSM) through Measure 12 (2019). At
CEP 25 details for the HSM were updated in light of the discovery
of the wreck and it was noted that a Conservation Management
Plan would be developed by the United Kingdom. The Conservation
Management Plan was prepared in accordance with Section 7.2.1 of
the “Guidelines for the assessment and management of Heritage in
Antarctica” (Resolution 1 (2022)).
Recent Developments
During the intersessional period the United Kingdom commissioned
the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) to develop a
Conservation Management Plan for HSM 93. The plan has been
devised in collaboration with marine archaeological experts from
Historic England and with input from descendants of the original
expedition, the Endurance22 expedition and the British Antarctic
Survey. The completed draft was then issued for expert consultation
with a range of international experts and bodies with heritage,
marine archaeological, deep-sea search and Antarctic expertise,
which included the International Polar Heritage Committee,
interested Consultative Parties and the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators.
Conclusions
The completed Conservation Management Plan (see Attachment A)
describes the significance of the heritage and scientific values of the
site and provides a series of policies for sustaining those values into
the future.
In particular, the Conservation Management Plan aims to protect a
range of values:
Historical values:
The wreck is a unique survival of an intact shipwreck directly
associated with a key event from the Heroic Age of Antarctic
exploration. Endurance became caught in ice, before eventually
sinking to the sea floor on 21 November 1915. The subsequent
ordeal of the expedition party, and the voyage of the James Caird
by Shackleton to South Georgia to raise the alarm, and the eventual
rescue of those on Elephant Island by the Chilean Navy steam tug
Yelcho, under the command of Lt Luis Pardo Villalón, form one of
the most historically significant events of the Heroic Age of
Antarctic Exploration.
The unique nature and location of the wreck provide an
unparalleled view of the Antarctic hitherto invisible. The ship itself
is rich in artefacts and features recognisable from imagery captured
before the ship was lost and which have been undisturbed since the
moment the ship struck the seabed. The ship’s name is visible on
the stern, along with the Polaris star, (Polaris being the original
name of the ship).
The study of the physical remains on the seabed will enhance the
understanding of this important event in the exploration of
Antarctica and complement the archival collections relating to the
Imperial-Trans Antarctic Expedition which survive across the world.
Protection of the wreck will in turn protect these historical, cultural
and natural heritage values.
Scientific values:
The wreck is an artificial reef colonised by a variety of sessile, filter-
feeding animals. As the date of loss is precisely known, the study of
the wreck site has the potential to yield information on the rate of
colonisation of the wreck structure by marine biological organisms.
Many of these species are classified as vulnerable marine ecosystem
(VME) taxa by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic
Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).
Aesthetic values:
Intact shipwrecks visible on the seabed can have a profound and
powerful aesthetic impact, providing a nexus for inspiration,
creativity and further research. The historical photographs of Frank
Hurley showing the Endurance trapped in the ice are some of the
most remarkable images of the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration.
This is now complemented by the imagery of the shipwreck lying
on the seabed.
The Conservation Management Plan also defines a series of
recommendations for action to enable the future protection and
enhancement of the wreck of Endurance which the co-sponsors of
this Working Paper encourages Parties to support.
The future protection of the wreck of Endurance must be an
international and collaborative endeavour. Amongst the many
management recommendations in the Conservation Management
Plan there are two which the co-sponsors of this Working Paper
seek to progress under the provisions of the Protocol:
to extend the protected area of seabed within the HSM designation;
and
to further protect the heritage values of the site by designating it as
an ASPA.
Amendment of the HSM description
After a review of some of the information from the Endurance22
expeditions, we can see the wreck of Endurance to be lying in a
semi-intact state, upright, and sitting well proud of the seabed. It is
surrounded by a field of debris derived from the ship as it sank,
which extends in an E-W direction. There is a high concentration of
debris extending for up to 400m to the west, while some debris can
also be seen extending up to 600m to the east. The current area of
the HSM has a radius of 500m which is insufficient to protect all
the historic material which has been observed to date. Upon advice
from the stakeholders involved in the Conservation Management
Plan it is recommended that the area encompassed by the HSM
listing be extended from 500m to 1500m radius to protect any
historic material extending beyond the wreck.
ASPA Prior Assessment
Following discussions at CEP 20, the Guidelines: A prior assessment
process for the designation of ASPAs and ASMAs were updated to
include a non-mandatory ASPA prior assessment template to
facilitate the provision of information consistent with the
Guidelines. The United Kingdom, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa
and United States have completed the prior assessment template for
the proposed ASPA (see: Attachment B), which includes maps and a
list of relevant publications.
Should the CEP agrees that the area merits special protection, the
United Kingdom intends to develop intersessionally a Management
Plan for the proposed ASPA in collaboration with all interested
Parties with the expectation that this will be submitted for
consideration during CEP 27.
Recommendations
The United Kingdom, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and the
United States recommend that the CEP:
acknowledge the Conservation Management Plan for HSM 93 (see
Attachment A);
recommend the ATCM adopts a Measure (draft at Annex II) to
update the ‘Description’ information field of HSM 93; and
consider the prior assessment (see Attachment B)for a proposed
Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) for the wreck of
Endurance and (1) agree that the values within the proposed ASPA
merit special protection, (2) endorse the development of a
Management Plan for the area, and (3) encourage interested Parties
to work with the proponents informally during the intersessional
period in the development of a Management Plan for potential
submission at CEP 27.

(ix) Description of the historical context
Endurance was the vessel owned and used by Sir Ernest Shackleton
during his 1914-16 Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Endurance became
beset in the sea ice before being crushed and eventually sinking to
the sea floor in 1915. What followed was a daring rescue by
Shackleton by taking the lifeboat James Caird to South Georgia to
fetch help. All the men marooned on Elephant
Island were saved and retuned home in 1916.
