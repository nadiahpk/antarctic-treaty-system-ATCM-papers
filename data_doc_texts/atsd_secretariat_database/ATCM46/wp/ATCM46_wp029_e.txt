Summary
At ATCM XLV (2023) in Helsinki, Parties decided to continue the
work of the Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) on Education and
Outreach, following a number of goals related to education and
outreach. This paper aims to provide a summary on the discussions
within the ICG and recommends considerations by the ATCM of the
outcomes of the intersessional work. Overall, there were four topics
discussed (education and outreach activities, exchange information
on equity, diversity and inclusion, key climate change messages
through education and outreach, and on review ICG work and
future developments), with 51 posts (from October 2023 up to 4
April 2024) from 24 Parties, Observers and Experts comprising
1105 views within the forum.
Background
The ICG on Education and Outreach was established during ATCM
XXXVIII (2015) in Sofia, Bulgaria, following a very successful
workshop in which ninety-seven participants from thirty-seven
Parties, Observers and Experts took part. During ATCM XXXIX
(2016) in Santiago, Chile, Bulgaria introduced WP 24 First Report
on the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach,
jointly prepared with Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, and the
United Kingdom. The ATCM recognised the contribution of Parties
and the usefulness of the ICG’s work. Parties were advised to
continue to use and promote the forum on Education and Outreach
to share information on education and outreach activities and
events with each other. Information about education and outreach
activities from an Antarctic Treaty perspective remains within the
Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan of the ATCM as well as within the
CEP Work Plan.
As stated in the Final Report of ATCM XLV (2023) in Helsinki,
Finland, paragraphs 257–258, the Meeting agreed its support for
continued use of the ATCM forum on education and outreach issues
and approved continuing the ICG on Education and Outreach for
another intersessional period, with the following aims:
• Fostering collaboration at both the national and international
level, on Education
and Outreach;
• Identifying key international activities/events related to education
and outreach for
possible engagement by the Antarctic Treaty Parties;
• Sharing results of education and outreach initiatives that
demonstrate the work of
Antarctic Treaty Parties in managing the Antarctic Treaty area;
• Emphasising ongoing environmental protection initiatives that had
been informed
by scientific observations and results, in order to reinforce the
importance of the
Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection;
• Promoting related education and outreach activities by Experts
and Observers, and
encouraging cooperation with these groups;
• Sharing best practices and encouraging, enhancing and promoting
diversity and
inclusion across the global Antarctic community, including among
scientists,
logisticians, policy-makers and all others engaged in Antarctic
matters, in order to
lower any barrier to the engagement of all the talents needed to
tackle the challenges
of the future of Antarctica;
• Encouraging Parties to provide the Secretariat with link(s) to their
web page(s) with
educational and outreach resources (the Secretariat would include
these links in its
“Educational Resources” section of the Secretariat website);
• Inviting Parties, Observers and Experts to review, during the
intersessional period
on the ATCM Education and Outreach Forum, the work carried out
by the ICG,
discussing its future development and the possibility to organise
and plan for the
second Workshop on Education and Outreach.
Method of Operation
The ICG operates using the online ATCM Discussion Forum, under
the topic ‘ICG on Education and Outreach’. The discussion is open
to all Parties, Observers and Experts, of which, 24 Parties,
Observers and Experts (up to 4 of April 2024) have participated in
the forum. The ICG began work in October 2023.
Discussions
There were 51 posts with 1105 views (up to 1 of April 2024). There
were four topics within the forum: 1- Education and outreach
activities carried out by Parties, Observers and Experts; 2 –
Exchange request of information on examples on education of
equity, diversity, and inclusion from Antarctic Programs, 3- Key
climate change messages in regards to a changing Antarctica and
communicating those through education and outreach and 4-
Feedback request on the work carried out by the ICG and discuss its
future development. It can be noted that posts included relevant
links to obtain further information on their activities and detailed
information of each post is available in the ATCM forum.
Topic 1: Education and outreach activities carried out by Parties,
Observers and Experts
A total of 17 Parties (Australia, Brazil, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, India, Italy, Korea (ROK), Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Türkiye, UK, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela), two Observers
(COMNAP and SCAR), and two Experts (ASOC, IAATO) reported
their activities on education and outreach. Reports noted activities
such as lectures/lessons/laboratory activities/webinars/seminars in
schools/Universities/Museums/other public areas (including during
the ATCM in Finland), videoconferences to follow live scientific
campaigns on research ships/research stations while in the
Antarctic, public visits to Antarctic ships, science/film/music
festivals, competitions, polar science/art camps/training courses/
music events, outreach information on up-to-date scientific
information on Antarctic environments, threats and human
activities (E.g. via the SCAR Antarctic Environments Portal;
biosecurity guidance to polar guides on Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI); research reports, brochures for Antarctic
visitors)), outreach museum events, national science and
international conferences/symposiums/summits, ministerial
missions dedicated to new Antarctic challenges, events celebrating
national contributions to Antarctic exploration, development of
educational
materials (including materials directed to teachers), incorporation
of Antarctic themes into national school curriculums, education and
outreach films), (digital) books (including the Polar Resource book
with Polar Educators International (PEI), Association of Polar Early
Career Scientists (APECS) and International Arctic Science
Committee (IASC)), educational/outreach films, exhibitions; TV/
newspaper interviews/documentaries/video animations linked to
media; social media (e.g. websites, blogs, Youtube channels,
webcams of up-to-date images of stations/ships, Facebook pages, X
(formerly twitter), Instagram), international activities (e.g.
celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, Polar
WEEKS, in cooperation with the APECS and PEI, Antarctica Day
celebrations, International Week of Peace and Science, International
Women´s day celebrations, International day of Women and Girls in
Science, International Antarctic Ambassadorship Day, European
Researchers´ Night activities). Indeed, programs focus on a wide
range of education including on (1) undergraduate education, (2)
informal science education or (3) formal PreK-12 science or math
education or (4) media education. A party noted the importance of
early career scientists as emerging professionals to enhance
environmental education and outreach activities about the
Antarctic, bridging the gap between traditionally complex language
and the public on issues, such as climate change and marine food-
webs. The large number of institutions and participants involved in
these activities is noteworthy.
Topic 2: Exchange request of information on examples on education
of equity, diversity, and inclusion from Antarctic Programs
Eight Parties (Australia, Chile, France, Netherlands, Portugal,
Romania, UK and Uruguay) and one observer (IAATO) contributed
to this topic. Parties expressed their national contributions on
equity, diversity and inclusion within their national programs, with
various actions. Activities included producing a strategy to fight
sexual and gender-based harassment and violence within the
national polar institute (E.g. on prevention, facilitating reporting,
procedures for handling reports) and training programmes for all
their Antarctic science expedition elements (and non-Antarctic staff)
in gender equity issues and the prevention and sanctioning of
harassment and mistreatment. A programme incorporated a specific
module in the mandatory induction presentations for all people
travelling to Antarctica, with a protocol for reporting sexual
harassment and abuse in Antarctica being continuously updated it
make it more effective and safer for all participants in Antarctic
expeditions. One party noted that interviews for Antarctic staff are
conducted by a two-person, gender diverse panel (to reduce the risk
of unconscious bias while providing transparency in recruit
decisions). A Station support officer is being trialled in an Antarctic
research station. Diversity has been highlighted in various ways
(e.g. by supporting Polar Pride, celebration of polar pioneers from
the black community, Women´s history month, International
Women day; see more below). A party organized a concert for
peace and science to promote education, art and science to
strengthen international cooperation, basic or intermediate/
advanced gender training and the production of a guide for
inclusive and gender-sensitive language in communication. Another
party organized a national competition for pupils and students
dedicated to promote Antarctic education, diversity and inclusion.
Additional three examples have been provided: i) the Women In
Science Excel (WISE) programme, which offers talented female
scientists the opportunity to set up or expand their own research
group at a research institute (attracting top female researchers and
engineers while promoting their career advancement), ii) videos
providing information about implicit bias regarding the ideal image
of what a good researcher is and provide practical suggestions,
based on scientific research, to optimise the evaluation process and
iii) Women in Polar Science (WiPS), with their social media sharing
women’s own experiences, both successes and struggles, while
highlighting their contributions to global science. It also highlights
and share information about opportunities, academic and non-
academic, across the whole network to enable better gender parity.
Topic 3- Key climate exchange messages in regards to a changing
Antarctica and communicating those though education and
outreach
Seven Parties (Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Korea (ROK),
Portugal, Türkiye) and two observers (COMNAP, SCAR) and one
Expert (WMO) supported this initiative on the “key messages”
based on scientific evidence and data are regarding a changing
Antarctica. As an Antarctic community, it shall be important to
impactfully use our collective education, outreach and
communications expertise and networks to deliver the key messages
and the importance of these to the global public.
Parties noted that the list of messages must be based on papers
already submitted previously to the ATCM and CEP, following
science based evidence with SCAR ACCE and its Decadal Synopsis,
and from peer-reviewed publications. The key messages agreed
were:
The Earth is Losing Ice in All Forms: Ice Sheet Mass Loss
Accelerating
Key Message from Antarctica: The Earth’s Second Largest Volume of
Ice, The West Antarctic Ice Sheet, May Be Melted/Gone by 2300
The Earth is Losing Ice in All Forms: Record Low Sea Ice
Key Message from Antarctica: Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Lowest Ever
Recorded once again (Austral Winter 2023)
The Earth is Losing Ice in All Forms: “Permanently” Frozen Ground
is Thawing
Key Message from Antarctica: As Antarctic Permafrost is Lost it is
Releasing More Greenhouse Gases than Expected & There May be
Other Unexpected Consequences of Frozen Ground Melt
Global Ocean Temperatures are Hitting Record Highs
Key Message from Antarctica: The Southern Ocean is Breaking Heat
Records (2022)
The Oceans are Becoming More Acidic
Key Message from Antarctica: Southern Ocean Chemistry is
Changing with acidification trend expected to be stronger in the
Southern Ocean
Rapid Climate Change Effects Biodiversity
Key Message from Antarctica: Antarctic species are highly adapted
to current Antarctic conditions and rapid and extreme changes will
increase vulnerability risk to many endemic Antarctic species
Atmospheric Temperatures are Forecasted to Continue to Increase
Key Message from Antarctica: The Polar Regions are the Earth’s
Refrigerators, as Global Temperatures Rise, the Refrigerator will
Warm
More discussions will follow in the next intersessional period in
order to provide more detailed information on the scientific
evidence to support these key messages, to support education and
outreach activities.
Topic 4- Feedback request on the work carried out by the ICG and
discuss its future development
Nine Parties (Bulgaria, Chile, France, India, Korea (ROK), Portugal,
Romania, Türkiye, UK, USA) contributed to this topic expressing
their support for the continuation of the ICG on Education and
Outreach for exchange of information with the ATCM and CEP, the
need to promote a higher level of cooperation between Parties,
Observers and Experts on education and outreach related to the
Antarctic Treaty, evaluate mechanisms to work together with
various stakeholders in obtaining the scientific facts/knowledge
(SCAR Capacity Building, Education and Training (CBET), in
engaging the young generations of scientists (with APECS) and in
reviewing the most important Antarctic topics for education and
outreach, carry out national/international education/outreach
activities and identify future topics that will need to be addressed
educationally to connect with Educators Worldwide (with the PEI)).
Finally, given
the first ATCM Workshop on Education and Outreach was held
eight years ago (Bulgaria, 2015), there is support for a second
Workshop on Education and Outreach in order to reflect on the
accomplishments achieved, to identify gaps and needs, and to plan
future actions.
Recommendations
The ICG recommends that the ATCM:
Recognise the usefulness of the Forum on Education and Outreach
and support the work of the ICG during one more intersessional
period;
Promote the usage of the Forum to provide information of Parties’
activities related to education and outreach and facilitate experts
within their delegations to access the Forum, such as the “key
climate change messages in regards to a changing Antarctica and
communicating those through education and outreach” ;
Supports Parties, Observers and Experts to engage in key
international activities/events related to education and outreach,
including those focused on equity, diversity and inclusion;
Encourages Parties to continue to promote not only Antarctica and
Antarctic research through their Education and Outreach activities,
but the Antarctic Treaty and the Environmental Protocol in
themselves;
Plans to organise the second Workshop on Education and Outreach.
