Agreement”)
Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological
Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction (“BBNJ
Agreement”)
Summary
Proposal for the ATCM to adopt a Resolution to recognise and
welcome the adoption of the BBNJ Agreement; welcome the
commitment not to undermine other legal instruments and
frameworks; and reaffirm that the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) is
the competent framework in Antarctic matters, including in relation
to the conservation and sustainable use of Antarctic marine
biological diversity.
Background
The BBNJ Agreement was adopted by consensus in New York on 19
June 2023, opened for signature on 20 September 2023, and will
remain open for signature until 20 September 2025. Upon its entry
into force it will be a legally binding instrument which seeks to
ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological
diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. The Agreement
covers four areas: marine genetic resources, including the fair and
equitable sharing of benefits; area-based management tools
including marine protected areas; environmental impact
assessments; and capacity building and transfer of marine
technology. It will come into force 120 days after the date of
deposit of the sixtieth instrument of ratification, approval,
acceptance or accession. Two countries (Chile and Palau) have, to
date (5 April 2024), deposited such instruments.
We consider that the adoption of the BBNJ Agreement is a
significant global milestone, consistent with the role of the ATS in
the Antarctic region, that warrants marking by means of an ATCM
Resolution.
At the start of the negotiations of the BBNJ Agreement, the ATCM
responded to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution
69/292, on the development of an international legally binding
instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use
of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction,
by recalling that the ATS is the competent framework within which
to address the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in
the Antarctic region (ATCM XL Final Report para 173). The ATCM
has also previously adopted a number of Resolutions relevant to the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Antarctic
region, including Resolution 7 (2005) on Biological Prospecting;
Resolution 9 (2009) on the Collection and Use of Antarctic
Biological Material; and Resolution 6 (2013) on Biological
Prospecting in Antarctica.
Article 5.2 of the BBNJ Agreement provides that it “shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner that does not undermine
relevant legal instruments and frameworks and relevant global,
regional, subregional and sectoral bodies and that promotes
coherence and coordination with these instruments, frameworks
and bodies”.
The ATS provides a comprehensive framework for the Antarctic that
addresses legal, political, and environmental considerations unique
to the region, including in relation to the conservation and
sustainable use of marine biodiversity. ATS instruments and
decision-making forums are competent to do for the Antarctic what
the BBNJ Agreement does for the ocean space beyond national
jurisdiction. Antarctic Treaty Contracting Parties have a duty to
prevent activity in Antarctica contrary to the Antarctic Treaty
(Article X).
It is therefore proposed that the ATCM adopt a Resolution to:
Recognise and welcome the BBNJ Agreement’s adoption, the
commitment to interpret or apply it in a manner that does not
undermine other legal instruments and frameworks or relevant
bodies, and the promotion of coherence and coordination;
Reaffirm that the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has competence
over matters relating to the Antarctic; and
Reassert that the ATS is the competent framework within which to
address issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of
Antarctic marine biological diversity.
Resolution X (2024)
Conservation and Sustainable Use of Antarctic Biological Diversity
The Representatives,
Noting the opening for signature of the Agreement under the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and
Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond
National Jurisdiction (“BBNJ Agreement”);
Further noting that Article 5.2 of the BBNJ Agreement states that
“the Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that
does not undermine relevant legal instruments and frameworks and
relevant global, regional, subregional and sectoral bodies and that
promotes coherence and coordination with these instruments,
frameworks and bodies”;
Recalling the obligation of Treaty Parties in Article X of the
Antarctic Treaty to exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the
Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no one engages in
any activity in Antarctica contrary to the principles and purposes of
the present Treaty;
Recalling also Resolution 7 (2005) on Biological Prospecting;
Resolution 9 (2009) on the Collection and Use of Antarctic
Biological Material; and Resolution 6 (2013) on Biological
Prospecting in Antarctica and previous relevant ATCM discussions;
Aware that countries are beginning to prepare domestic legislation
to implement the BBNJ Agreement;
Recommend that their Governments:
Recognise and welcome the adoption of the BBNJ Agreement and
the commitment to interpret or apply it in a manner that does not
undermine other legal instruments and frameworks or relevant
bodies, and the promotion of coherence and coordination;
Reaffirm that the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has competence
over matters relating to the Antarctic; and
Reassert that the ATS is the competent framework within which to
address issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of
Antarctic marine biological diversity.
