Report of the CEP Subsidiary Group on Climate Change Response
(SGCCR) 2023-2024
Working Paper submitted by Germany as Convenor of the SGCCR
Summary
During the 2023-2024 intersessional period, the Subsidiary Group
on Climate Change Response (SGCCR) prioritized activities outlined
in the Climate Change Response Work Programme (CCRWP) as
proposed in WP 37 (ATCM XLIV/CEP XXIV). Key areas of focus
included assessing the status of climate-vulnerable Antarctic
species, developing guidance for establishing and managing
protected areas, keeping the Non-Native Species (NNS) Manual
updated, and de-contamination of past activity sites. Additionally,
efforts were made to assess climate change risks to infrastructure,
with COMNAP indicating ongoing work on infrastructure
vulnerability. A workshop to intensify coordination on climate
change response in the marine realm with SC-CAMLR is planned for
2025, to further emphasize the collaborative efforts to address
climate change impacts in the Antarctic region.
Despite diverse challenges and varying degrees of progress among
participating nations, there is a collective acknowledgment of the
importance of further actions, highlighting a commitment to
mitigating climate change impacts in the Antarctic. Continued
collaboration and information sharing will be crucial in advancing
these critical initiatives.
Background
The CCRWP was adopted through Resolution 4 (2015) and updated
by CEP in 2016. To support updating, implementation and follow-
up of the CCRWP, the subsidiary group on climate change response
(SGCCR) was established at ATCM XL (Decision 1 (2017)). At CEP
XXIII, following a review of the SGCCR, the Committee agreed that
the work of the SGCCR should continue in the future under its
current Terms of Reference (CEP XXIII Final Report, para. 35). The
SGCCR maintains flexibility regarding membership and encourages
new members.
The Terms of Reference for the SGCCR are to facilitate the efficient
and timely implementation of the CCRWP. In addition to the agreed
Terms of Reference, CEP XX tasked the SGCCR to develop operating
mechanisms to support good participation and efficient handling of
work (CEP XX Final Report, para. 74). Regarding the CEP Five-Year
Work Plan, ‘Climate Change Implications for the Environment’ is set
as a Priority 1 issue, with the key action ‘Implementing the
CCRWP’.
Prior to CEP XXIV (2022) the SGCCR drafted an update of the
CCRWP based on emerging issues and surveyed developments of
climate change effects over last years, which was presented in WP
37 (ATCM XLIV/CEP XXIV). No consensus was reached on updates
to the CCRWP and the SGCCR therefore has continued working to
implement the existing CCRWP (2016) in accordance with the
current Terms of Reference.
SGCCR operation during the 2023-2024 intersessional period
Actively contributing were thirteen representatives from ten CEP
Member countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Norway, Peru,
Portugal, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom
and the United States) and three Observer Organizations (ASOC,
COMNAP and SCAR). The SGCCR was convened by one of the CEP
Vice-Chairs, Dr. Heike Herata.
During the 2022-2023 intersessional period, the SGCCR focused on
prioritizing activities already described in the CCRWP. During that
time the Subsidiary Group identified six activities which were
proposed in WP 048 (ATCM XLV-CEP XXV) to be prioritized and for
which confirmation was received from the CEP community at CEP
XXV. Accordingly, during the 2023-2024 intersessional period,
building upon the activities outlined in the previous report, the
SGCCR focused on further advancing the following activities:
Supporting work to assess the status of climate-vulnerable Antarctic
species (Action 6c),
Developing guidance on climate change considerations in
documents for establishing and managing protected areas (Action
2e),
Keeping the Non-Native Species (NNS) manual updated with
current developments (Action 1a),
Intensifying coordination on climate change response in the marine
realm with SC-CAMLR (Action 3e),
De-contamination of past sites of activities in the Antarctic area
(Action 5f),
Assessing the risk of climate change for Antarctic existing and
projected infrastructure and associated environmental consequences
and considering the impacts of climate change linked with the EIA
guidelines, e.g. ensuring proposed long-term facilities are suitably
resilient to climate change (Action 5a and 5d).
In response to activity no. (1), which calls for promoting research
on the status assessment of climate-vulnerable Antarctic species,
most SGCCR members emphasized the importance of advancing
such assessments. Based on the collected responses, it is apparent
that while specific programs targeting vulnerable Antarctic species
are lacking among most CEP Members, various ongoing monitoring
studies and individual projects show potential for contributing to
this area. Continuing to report on these studies for awareness and
enhanced collaboration, which in turn could improve the
development of holistic approaches to this challenging research
issue, particularly in evaluating the species’ status amidst climate
change.
Several members supported the suggestion to identify known
climate-vulnerable species as a basis for prioritizing efforts. A
recommended starting point may be IP045 (CEPXXV) on Managing
threats to Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity, which outlines the
regional vulnerability of terrestrial Antarctic biodiversity groups to
potential threats under climate change. Additionally, SCAR will
provide updated information to the CEP on assessing the status of
the emperor penguin based on recent research.
Regarding activity no. (2), which involves developing guidance on
climate change considerations in documents for establishing and
managing protected areas, several SGMP Members expressed
interest in creating an inventory of projects, studies, and scientific
results relevant to protected area systems. However, several
Members pointed out the challenges associated with maintaining
such an inventory, particularly in terms of human resources. They
emphasized the need for SCAR's support in this.
Some members expressed willingness to contribute to ongoing
efforts within the SGMP to review existing tools for area protection
and management to ensure they adequately address climate change
considerations. For this, the SGMP planned to initiate revisions on
the ‘Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for
Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (2011)’ in the next
intersessional period and will report back to CEP 26 on progress,
see WP XX.
Regarding activity no. (3), which involves keeping the Non-Native
Species (NNS) manual updated with current developments, the
subsequent revision conducted by Germany on behalf of the SGMP
revealed no urgent need for revisions. It was found that climate
change issues were
already adequately addressed in the relevant sections of the
manual. Therefore, no further action is deemed necessary at this
time.
Regarding activity no. (4), there is a positive outlook on enhancing
coordination with SC-CAMLR regarding climate change response in
the marine realm. Concrete measures are underway to prepare for a
joint workshop. The upcoming CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop scheduled
for 2025 is already in the planning stages. Initial discussions
including a review of the first draft of the Terms of Reference have
also taken place in the informal ICG, led by France (Maude Jolly);
see WP XX.
Furthermore, there is recognition that insights from the SC-CAMLR
workshop on climate change held in 2023 could prove valuable for
the upcoming joint workshop. SCAR is working to address some of
the specific recommendations from the 2023 workshop which may
be useful to both the CEP and SC-CAMLR, for example on
developing a framework for using climate models to drive
ecological projections, a glossary of climate-related terms and
definitions, and advice on best practice for selecting, using and
communicating Earth system models.
Regarding activities (5) and (6), there is a collective effort to
address concerns regarding the de-contamination of past sites of
activities in the Antarctic area and assessing the risk of climate
change for existing and projected infrastructure. Some participating
CEP Members have reported ongoing activities related to clean-up
and de-contamination efforts and risk assessments. However, it is
worth noting that while certain Members have reported taking
actions, others may not have had the opportunity to engage in
discussions regarding these tasks. Consequently, it should not be
assumed that uniformity exists in the risks faced at all stations or in
the measures that National Antarctic Programs have implemented.
Most CEP Members have acknowledged the importance of
identifying further actions to prevent potential hazards posed by
changing environments, both on land and in coastal areas, due to
rising sea levels.
COMNAP has undertaken significant work on the clean-up of sites
of past activity (5f), and they have indicated to CEP and ATCM that
they are currently working on infrastructure vulnerability, as
reported during the joint ATCM/CEP Climate Change Workshop
2023 in WP029. COMNAP is also collaborating with SCAR and
WMO to understand expected sea level changes around Antarctica,
as reported in IP095 (2023). COOMNAP plan to submit a further
paper, building on that IP, to the CEP 2024 meeting. Regarding the
provision of advice to the CEP on CCRWP topics 5a and 5d,
COMNAP believes it is too early for a joint workshop. Instead, it is
their intention is to provide advice to the CEP meetings in 2024 and
2025 concerning the consideration of topics related to de-
contamination and climate change risk assessment.
Recommendations
Germany, on behalf of the SGCCR, recommends that the CEP
Members continue to work actively on the implementation of the
CCRWP. Based on the progress and responses received regarding
the CCRWP activities, the following recommendations are proposed:
Supporting work to assess the status of climate-vulnerable Antarctic
species (Action 6c):
SGCCR recommends that the CEP starts work to identify known
climate-vulnerable species as a basis for prioritizing efforts to
advance assessments of climate-vulnerable species.
Developing guidance on climate change considerations in
documents for establishing and managing protected areas (Action
2e):
The SGCCR appreciates the efforts by the SGMP Members to review
existing tools for area protection and management, ensuring they
adequately address climate change
considerations. Further developments should be supported. The
SGCCR recommends no further action at this time.
Keeping the Non-Native Species (NNS) manual updated with
current developments (Action 1a):
As no urgent revisions are needed, SGCCR recommends no further
action at this time.
Intensifying coordination on climate change response in the marine
realm with SC-CAMLR (Action 3e):
The SGCCR recognises that further efforts are underway for a joint
CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop scheduled in 2025 and potential
collaborative research projects. Therefore, the SGCCR encourages
Members to actively participate in the preparatory work for this
workshop.
De-contamination of past sites of activities in the Antarctic area
(Action 5f) and
Assessing the risk of climate change for Antarctic existing and
projected infrastructure and associated environmental consequences
and considering the impacts of climate change linked with the EIA
guidelines, e.g., ensuring proposed long-term facilities are suitably
resilient to climate change (Action 5a and 5d):
SGCCR recommends that the CEP acknowledges the importance of
further actions to prevent potential hazards posed by changing
environments and therefore, invites the Members to actively pursue
efforts to address de-contamination and climate change risks to
infrastructure.
SGCCR acknowledges COMNAP's ongoing work in this regard and
suggests aligning future discussions with COMNAP's advice to the
CEP meetings in 2024 and 2025.
