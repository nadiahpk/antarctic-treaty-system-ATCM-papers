Update on the status of emperor penguins in a variable and
changing environment
Update on the status of emperor penguins in a variable and
changing environment
Working Paper submitted by SCAR
Summary
This paper introduces the results of a 10-year circumpolar
assessment (2009 to 2018) of emperor penguin colonies, based on
satellite imagery, field validation surveys, and a Bayesian modelling
framework (LaRue and Iles et al., 2024). This study developed
indices of abundance for the global population of adult emperor
penguins, showing a probable 9.6% decline over the study period.
The drivers of change are not yet fully understood, highlighting the
need for continued research and monitoring. The results of the new
study, together with other recent research, provide context to a
previous SCAR assessment that the emperor penguin may be
vulnerable to the ongoing and projected effects of climate change
(ATCMXLIII, Working Paper 37). SCAR encourages Parties to
support enhanced collaboration across National Antarctic
Programmes to improve understanding about the species, and
factors contributing to observed population change.
Background
The life cycle of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is
closely linked to Antarctic sea-ice, as breeding is mostly initiated on
fast-ice early in the Antarctic winter. Sixty-six breeding sites are
currently known (Fretwell and Trathan, 2019; 2021; Fretwell,
2024) and while most recently-discovered sites are small, their
locations have also expanded the geographic scale of monitoring,
including a few in areas offshore from the coastal margins (Fretwell
and Trathan, 2021; Fretwell, 2024). According to Sentinel satellite
sea-ice observations from 2018 to 2023, approximately 42% of
emperor penguin breeding locations (28 of the 66) experienced
early fast-ice break-up at least once in five years (ATCMXLV,
Working Paper 52), possibly resulting in breeding failures. An
increasingly warming Antarctic environment may alter the
availability of breeding habitat, with possible impacts on the
survival of the species that require detailed investigation.
Emperor penguin population projections from state-of-the-art
demographic models that include sea-ice projections derived from
coupled Earth System Models, integrate the complex relationships
between reproduction, mortality, and sea-ice throughout the
species’ life cycle (Jenouvrier et al., 2012; 2020; 2021). These
models project fewer colonies will be in existence by the end of
2100 with key refugia in just a few locations around Antarctica.
In 2023, Members of the Committee on Environmental Protection
agreed to report research on the status of the emperor penguin
(ATCM XLV Final Report, paragraph 104). This paper reports a
recent assessment of the global population of emperor penguins,
and outlines further collaborative research that could help explain
the observed change in numbers.
A multi-year time series documenting changes in observed emperor
penguin numbers
LaRue and Iles et al. (2024) present a global analysis based on high-
resolution satellite imagery, field validation surveys and Bayesian
modelling, which assesses the population size and trajectory of
adult emperor penguins across their entire population range. This
includes an updated global index of abundance of ~252,000
breeding adults (as of 2009), and analysis showing that fewer
breeding adults (~228,000) were present in 2018 than in 2009. The
observed pattern is statistically well-supported despite large
uncertainties. The number of birds varied at any breeding location,
and at different regional scales. A weak correlation (Spearman rank
r2 = -
0.52) existed between trends in the abundance index and regional
fast-ice trends; the probability of population decline was greater in
regions where fast-ice trends were negative.
Future work to explain the observed decrease in numbers
Multiple hypotheses could explain the observed population changes,
and these hypotheses must be considered for future monitoring and
international research collaboration. Additional work is needed in
the following areas to allow us to better understand the potential
causes of decline:
Physical and environmental
Wind strength and storm frequency vary spatially and temporally,
and may influence penguin populations in different ways (e.g.,
detectability and estimates derived from satellite imagery;
Labrousse et al.2021). Wind also plays a large role in the formation
and stability of fast ice.
Biological
If reliable fast-ice habitat changes, birds may move to other
breeding sites, such as in 2016, when fast-ice broke-up at Halley
Bay (Fretwell and Trathan, 2019). LaRue and Iles et al. (2024) only
monitored the 50 colonies known before 2015 (most were known
by 2009). However, the 16 colonies found since 2009 could
partially contribute to the decrease in the abundance index
(~24,000 birds) if some birds relocated. Enhanced satellite and
aerial surveys will help verify breeding locations.
Fewer birds in spring may result from decreased recruitment, or
lowered breeding success. Remote-camera-systems at accessible
colonies (e.g. Atka Bay) can provide data on intra-seasonal
fluctuation in adults, and help contextualize abundance indices
from optical satellite imagery (available only after sunrise in
spring).
Demographic studies provide information about changes in
recruitment, longevity, breeding propensity and other vital rates,
including in relation to long-term changes in the environment.
Collaborations that enhance demographic understanding could
further elucidate drivers of change in the index of penguin
abundance.
Phenological studies (e.g. on reproductive timing) will help inform
the abundance index, as between-colony differences may contribute
to differences in the index of abundance.
At-sea surveys in areas regularly frequented by vessels can provide
information about changes in prey availability, augmenting
information about local or regional changes in marine food webs.
Where surveys are close to emperor penguin colonies, insights into
changes in the abundance index may be possible. Understanding
any ongoing changes in other predator species would provide
additional context.
Decadal trends and long-term variation
The emperor penguin abundance index is still relatively short (2009
to 2018), especially for a seabird with a life expectancy of over 25
years. Due to delayed maturity (3 to 5 years), it takes several years
before recruits join the breeding population. Thus, the work
presented by LaRue and Isles et al. (2024) must continue, covering
the entire geographic range of the species, given regional variability
in environmental conditions, and movement of birds amongst
colonies.
Methodological development
Collaborating with experts in machine learning approaches may be
an important next step because analysis of remotely-sensed images
using maximum-likelihood classification is laborious, and to a
degree, subjective. Such future approaches could help reduce
observer bias, and ideally, be transferable across satellite platforms.
International collaboration
Currently only a few research groups work on emperor penguins,
whether in the field, using remote sensing, or modelling. The long-
term study sites at Pointe Géologie (1962 onwards), ASPA 101
Taylor Glacier (intermittently from 1957 to 1975, and ongoing from
1988), and ASPA 127 Haswell Island (intermittently from 1970 to
2020) are now becoming increasingly important, yet other studies
are urgently needed. The recently initiated study at Atka Bay (2018
onwards) is an example of what could be initiated at other
localities. The expansion of data streams would facilitate
understanding about ecological variability at different sites, adding
greatly to modelled projections of population change and
refinement of the abundance index.
The majority of emperor penguin breeding sites are remote from
scientific research stations, but some are close. Initiation of studies
at close sites would add greatly to the overall sum of knowledge,
including for colonies with different sea-ice conditions, wind
dynamics and different prey conditions. Collaboration among
scientists will facilitate improved understanding, whilst ensuring
consistent terminologies and methodologies (e.g. for remote
sensing, image analysis, field data collection, aerial and ground
counts, molecular methods, etc.). An expanded monitoring
programme could be affiliated with or coordinated by SCAR but
will also require support from National Antarctic Programmes.
Several upcoming international programmes may be able to
contribute to the development of expanded monitoring, including
Antarctica InSync (2027-30) and the proposed International Polar
Year (2032-33). Recent reports of High Pathogenicity Avian
Influenza reaching Antarctic penguin colonies suggest that links
with the SCAR EG-BAMM Antarctic Wildlife Health Network would
also be paramount.
Conclusion
A recent circumpolar assessment of emperor penguin colonies
indicates a probable 9.6% decrease in the number of adult emperor
penguins present at colonies during spring, in the period
2009-2018. The drivers of this decline are not understood,
emphasizing the need for more extensive research and monitoring.
SCAR encourages Parties to support enhanced collaboration across
National Antarctic Programs on research to improve understanding
about the factors that may be driving observed population change.
