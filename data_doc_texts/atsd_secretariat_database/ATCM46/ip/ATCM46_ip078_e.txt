Harmonizing environmental research and monitoring of chemical
pollution in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean - the POLEMP
Project
Information Paper submitted by Germany
Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for harmonizing
environmental monitoring and research efforts to assess chemical
pollution in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. It takes up the
suggestion from ATCM XLIV to initiate and coordinate a more
structured approach to sampling and data collection of
environmental contamination in the Antarctic. The paper highlights
the fragmented nature of current studies and the lack of
standardized methodologies that hampers the ability to
comprehensively understand the distribution, prevalence and
impact of pollutants in the Antarctic region. The paper informs
about the POLEMP project which aims to develop an advanced
environmental monitoring framework for persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). It
seeks to establish a unified framework that encompasses consistent
monitoring protocols, data sharing practices, and collaborative
research and logistic initiatives. This approach aims to enhance the
quality and comparability of data on chemical pollutants,
facilitating effective policy-making and conservation strategies to
protect the Antarctic's fragile ecosystem from the adverse effects of
chemical pollution.
Background
Antarctica is highly sensitive to global changes and increasingly
impacted by various physical and socio-economic factors that affect
both its natural and human environment. Chemical pollution,
including greenhouse gases, black carbon, heavy metals and
persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances, is a significant
concern (ATCM XLIII/IP137, ATCM XXXI/IP097, Nash et al., 2023,
Xie et al., 2022). These pollutants originate from distant continents
and local activities such as shipping, tourism, and research
operations (ATCM XXXII/IP069, ATCM XL/IP022, ATCM XLIV/
IP004). Studies have shown bioaccumulation of heavy metals like
arsenic, cadmium, mercury and zinc (ATCM XLV/IP032); persistent
organic pollutants (POPs) like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
pesticides, legacy chlorinated hydrocarbons and per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found in marine food webs
and predators (ATCM XXXVII/IP008, Xie and Kallenborn, 2023).
Atmospheric transport of heavy metals, POPs and contaminants of
emerging concern (CECs) to the Antarctic further underscores the
global reach of these contaminants (Xie et al., 2022).
Research efforts have been aimed at identifying and understanding
the impact of chemical pollution on Antarctic species, with a focus
on classic heavy metals, POPs and CECs found in various
environmental matrices (ATCM XXXVII/IP008). Microplastics (MPs)
have been detected in seawater and air of the Southern Ocean,
indicating that such pollutants reach remote Antarctic ecosystems
and pose potential risks to different environmental compartments
(ATCM XLIV Final Report, ATCM XLIV/IP068, ATCM XLV/IP078,
CEP XXIV/BP013).
Despite the growing body of research, challenges remain, notably
the lack of harmonized sampling and analytical methods for
assessing chemical pollution (ATCM XLIII/IP021, ATCM XLV/
IP061). This absence of standardization leads to significant
discrepancies in reported pollutant concentrations, which
complicates the understanding of their sources, sinks, long-range
transport, and impacts. To address these issues, there is a pressing
need for enhanced international collaboration, from standardized
sampling techniques to the establishment of an international
specimen bank and a shared database for chemical pollution data.
Such efforts are critical for advancing our understanding of and
response to the environmental challenges facing Antarctica.
Developing a framework for environmental monitoring of chemical
pollution in Antarctica
The German Environment Agency (UBA) has launched the research
project “Establishing a concept for a Polar Environmental
Monitoring Programme (POLEMP)” with the focus on Antarctic
environmental pollution monitoring. The POLEMP project aims to
develop an advanced environmental monitoring framework for
POPs and CECs in order to bridge current knowledge gaps about
chemical pollution in the Antarctic. It seeks to establish a
comprehensive Antarctic monitoring program, integrating
observations of organic contaminant and heavy metals occurrences
and their temporal variations through both national and
international efforts. The proposed Antarctic monitoring program
will leverage methodologies from other initiatives like the Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP), the Antarctic
Monitoring and Assessment Program (AnMAP) and the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). By reviewing literature
and analysing existing Antarctic and Arctic samples, the project
intends to recommend strategies for an Antarctic environmental
specimen bank, which facilitates international collaboration and
future analytical studies. It will compile current knowledge on
Antarctic chemical pollution for key environmental forums and
conventional meeting for in-depth discussions among scientists and
stakeholders. The POLEMP project is a joint effort by international
partners from science, environmental specimen banks (ESBs) and
policy.
The POLEMP project aims to assess environmental pollution by
examining various samples (air, water, ice, sediment, soil and
organisms) for chemical pollution including POPs, CECs, and heavy
metals. Environmental samples recently collected at several
Antarctic research bases and archived biota samples shared by the
Italian Antarctic environmental specimen bank will be investigated
to establish baseline contaminant loads, especially for CECs.
The second objective of the program is to prioritize substances and
chemical groups for monitoring, using data from AMAP, and novel
information on CECs from screening surveys. Besides, POLEMP will
integrate and recommend sampling techniques and standard
operating protocols) for analysing classic POPs and emerging
contaminants (e.g., PFAS, flame-retardants, plasticizers, pesticides,
personal care products and pharmaceuticals), and endocrine-
disrupting chemicals.
Up to now few Environmental Specimen Banks archive samples
from Antarctica, though chemical pollution poses a significant
threat in this region. One of the POLEMP project partners, the
University of Genoa's Antarctic Environmental Specimen Bank, has
been collecting diverse samples (e.g., water, soil, mussels, and fish)
for pioneer research since 1990s. Many other SCAR member
countries collect Antarctic samples for specific research programs
(ATCM XLIII/IP021, ATCM XLIV/WP011rev.1, ATCM XLIV/IP007).
Despite these efforts, there is an urgent need for an international
collaboration among national Antarctic programs and ESBs. Hence,
the POLEMP project aims to establish a systematic monitoring
concept by sharing existing logistics, using harmonized sample
processing and archiving to better understand the environmental
challenges facing chemical pollution in Antarctica. One aim of the
POLEMP project is to consult different national environmental
sample banks to summarize information on effective sample
selection and storage and methods. Based on this a protocol could
be set up to serve as a basis for the recommendation to create an
integrated Antarctic ESB.
Together with the SCAR working group on persistent organic
pollutants (SCARImPACT) the POLEMP project is going to hold a
workshop in October 2024. The International Workshop on
Monitoring Chemical Pollution in Antarctica – Tackling future
Challenges together (IWMCPA) enables international experts from
science, policy and environmental specimen banks to discuss and
share initial findings for Antarctic environmental pollution
monitoring and research. This workshop is designed to facilitate a
collective dialogue on the creation of a comprehensive, Antarctic-
wide pollution monitoring system. It will leverage the diverse
perspectives and experiences of all attendees, aiming to incorporate
feasible strategies and to consider the needs of
future user groups in the project's design. More detailed information

Conclusions and perspectives
The German POLEMP project sets a pioneering course towards
addressing the critical issue of chemical pollution in Antarctica by
aiming to establish a comprehensive Polar Environmental
Monitoring Programme. In doing so, it implements the CEP’s advice
to intensify cooperation between all stakeholders to initiate a more
structured sampling and data collection of environmental
contamination in the Antarctic.
This initiative seeks to close the knowledge gap on distribution,
prevalence and impact of POPs and CECs in the Antarctic through
the development of an advanced monitoring framework. Leveraging
methodologies from existing programs like AMAP and programs
under development (AnMAP), POLEMP intends to harmonize efforts
at both national and international levels.
The project highlights the importance of collaborative research,
proposing the establishment of an Antarctic environmental
specimen bank to facilitate future studies and international
discourse on pollution impacts.
Through integrating the knowledge from literature, reports and
practical implementation of Antarctic sampling and analysis, we
seek to pave the way for effective and sustainable monitoring and
mitigation strategies, highlighting the urgent need for international
cooperation in preserving Antarctica's pristine environment.
