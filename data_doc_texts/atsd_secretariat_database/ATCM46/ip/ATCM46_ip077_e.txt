Tourism and other Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic
Treaty Area: Information to support the development of the
Framework
Summary
In the context of the rapid growth and diversification of tourism
and non-governmental activities in Antarctica, and consistent with
Antarctica’s status as a natural reserve, New Zealand supports the
development of a comprehensive Framework on Antarctic tourism
and other non-governmental (NGO) activities in the Antarctic
Treaty Area (Decision 6, 2023). This paper contributes information
to support the development of the Framework.
Principles to support the Framework
The Framework should build on and support further
implementation of existing obligations and provisions of the
Protocol on Environmental Protection relevant to Antarctic tourism
regulation, including, inter alia:
The protection of the Antarctic environment…. and the intrinsic
value of Antarctica, including its wilderness and aesthetic values:
Article 3 (1);
Activities shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse
impacts on the Antarctic Environment: Article 3(2a);
Prior assessment of cumulative impacts of activities shall be
undertaken: Article 3 (3c (ii));
Regular and effective monitoring shall take place to allow the
assessment of the impacts of ongoing activities, including the
verification of predicted impacts: Article 3 (2d);
Activities shall be planned and conducted… so as to accord priority
to scientific research and to preserve the value of Antarctica as an
area for the conduct of such research: Article 3 (3);
Parties should draw on the advice of the CEP on matters related to
the Framework including, for example, on the state of the Antarctic
environment, response action for environmental emergencies, the
need for scientific research, including environmental monitoring,
and the elaboration of the protected areas system: Article 12;
Arrange inspections of tourism and NGO activities to promote the
protection of the Antarctic environment and ensure compliance
with the Protocol: Article 14;
Consider designation of Antarctic Specially Managed Areas to
minimise environmental impacts: Annex V, Article 4.
The Framework should draw on, strengthen, and give further effect
to existing agreed principles and guidelines, including, inter alia:
The general principles of Antarctic tourism: Resolution 7 (2009);
The guidelines on contingency planning, insurance and other
matters for tourism and other NGO activities: Resolution 6 (2017);
To consider the implications of climate change for Antarctica when
managing human activities, and seek to avoid or mitigate additional
identified non-climatic stresses to the Antarctic terrestrial and
marine environment: Resolution 8 (2021);
To prevent permanent facilities for tourism and NGO activities in
Antarctica: Resolution 5 (2022);
The voluntary on-board observer operational framework for vessel-
based tourism in the Antarctic Treaty Area: Resolution 9 (2021);
To develop a centrally managed database of tourism activities, e.g.,
through redesign and concerted use of the EIES: Recommendation
1, CEP Tourism Study;
To improve site-specific management, a centrally managed ATCM
database of tourist sites, including information on their
environmental sensitivities, should be established: Recommendation
2, CEP Tourism Study;
To develop an appropriate method of assessing site sensitivity and a
relative sensitivity analysis undertaken for at least the most heavily
visited sites in Antarctica: Recommendation 3, CEP Tourism Study;
To consider of the vulnerability of sites to non-native species
establishment, for the purpose of more rigorously assessing
appropriate management needs, and to inform the Environmental
Impact Assessment process: Recommendation 4, CEP Tourism
Study;
Recall the spatial variability across Antarctica in human activities
and environments e.g., across Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic
Regions (16 biologically distinct regions): Resolution 3 (2017).
Existing agreed priority work (e.g., in the Multi-Year Strategic Work
Plan (MYSWP) and CEP 5-Year work plan) should be built into the
Framework, and continue to progress in parallel to the development
of the Framework, including, inter alia:
Implementation and entry into force of Measure 4 (2004) and
Measure 15 (2009) (MYSWP);
Strengthening Site Specific Guidelines (MYSWP);
Enhancing compliance with ATCM regulations relating to non-
governmental activities including tourism activities (MYSWP);
Continue to strengthen cooperation and coordination between
Competent Authorities.
In developing the Framework, there is merit in drawing on the
building blocks stated in ATCM XLV WP13, Dedicated process for
the development of a comprehensive and consistent framework for
Antarctic tourism and other non-governmental activities including
managing growth, managing diversification, monitoring,
compliance and enforcement.
The Framework should be sufficiently flexible so as to be applicable
to future activities that are not yet foreseeable, facilitating a
precautionary and principled approach, consistent with the
Environmental Principles of the Protocol (Article 3).
