Developing a systematic approach to addressing the footprint of
tourism
Developing a systematic approach to addressing the footprint of
tourism
Summary
The footprint of tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula is currently
much larger than the area protected in ASPAs, and this footprint is
increasing. ASOC believes that the discussions on the
comprehensive framework for managing tourism must find practical
ways to manage this growing footprint and ensure that tourism
growth does not come at the expense of Antarctica’s wilderness and
biodiversity values. ASOC recommends that the ATCM accomplish
this through undertaking a systematic conservation planning
process; implementing a target of 30% protection of terrestrial,
coastal, and marine areas by 2030; developing new management
approaches using existing tools; and developing binding regulations
that apply generally to all visited sites.
Introduction
In 2023, ATCM 45 adopted Decision 6 (2023), Dedicated process
for the development of a comprehensive and consistent framework
for Antarctic tourism and other non-governmental activities, and
agreed to dedicate two days during ATCM 46 to discussions on such
a framework. For simplicity, in this paper we will refer to the
comprehensive and consistent framework for Antarctic tourism and
other non-governmental activities as the “comprehensive
framework”. This Decision was adopted in response to a proposal
by France, the Netherlands, and a number of co-sponsors in WP 13
(2023). ASOC strongly supported the conclusions of WP 13 and
Decision 6 (2023).
Over the past three decades, ASOC has consistently urged the ATCM
to adopt stricter regulations for the growing footprint of the tourism
industry in Antarctica. Unfortunately, this has largely not occurred,
resulting in a situation in which “the default is to allow tourist
activities unless consensus is reached on prohibitions or limitation”
(Bastmeijer et al. 2023). ASOC believes the comprehensive
framework must find practical ways to ensure that tourism growth
does not come at the expense of Antarctica’s wilderness and
biodiversity values.
In this paper, ASOC provides recommendations for developing a
systematic approach to addressing the growing footprint of tourism.
Defining footprint
Brooks et al. (2018) identify different types of footprints in the
literature, including various kinds of physical, non-physical and
indirect footprints. In general terms, footprint is the spatial extent
of disturbance, with ‘disturbance’ (or impact) having different levels
as defined in Art. 8 and Annex I of the Protocol. “Visitation
footprint refers to the land area of Antarctica that has had human
presence...Tourism sites are included in this footprint, although
cumulative impacts may lead to additional types of footprints.” For
definitions of footprint, see Brooks et al., (2018) and references
therein. For the footprint of tourism see also Roura (2011).
The tourism footprint, as used here, is the spatial extent of tourism
presence – with levels of disturbance (or impact) that could range
from “less than minor or transitory” to higher levels, in the
terminology of the Protocol, depending on the case. In this paper
we do not imply that footprint equates to impact, however, if direct
impacts of tourism occur these are likely to happen within the
growing footprint of this activity.
A systematic approach to managing growth
The need to manage tourism growth and footprint in Antarctica is
one of the main reasons the ATCM is currently pursuing discussions
on a comprehensive framework. Annual visitor numbers have
increased to over 100,000 in a relatively short amount of time, with
a corresponding increase in the footprint of tourism activities.
The ATCM does not have measures to address or limit growth, nor
does it comprehensively address tourism. Many of the tools
currently used to manage the conduct of tour companies, such as
site guidelines for visitors (SGVs) and EIAs, are limited to certain
sites, operators, or activities, and do not address tourism impacts on
a continental or regional scale. For example, of the 441 different
sites visited between the 2018-19 and 2022-23 tourist seasons, only
44 had dedicated SGVs. Some of these sites, such as the Gerlache
Strait, are extended areas primarily used for cruising, but the
regular presence of ships is still likely to cause impacts, such as grey
water discharges (see ASOC IP submitted to this meeting) and black
carbon deposition (Cordero et al. 2022).
The ATCM has limited oversight of growth. Operators are not
required to seek approval from the ATCM before selecting new sites
for landings (Hemmings & Roura, 2003), and there are no binding
limits to daily or seasonal visitation in most locations. This is a
significant gap in the Antarctic tourism management regime.
Assessing the actual footprint of tourism
Approximately 0.44% of the Antarctic continent is ice-free during
the summer months, 20% of which is in the Antarctic Peninsula
region, where most tourism takes place. These limited ice-free areas
provide vital habitat for terrestrial ecosystems, including endemic
flora and invertebrates. Only 1.5% of the ice-free areas on the
continent are protected in Antarctic Specially Protected Areas
(ASPAs) (Shaw et al. 2014).
Of the ASPAs that include ice-free areas, 26 are in the Antarctic
Peninsula region. These 26 ASPAs cover an area of 1,266 square
kilometers, with approximately 50% of that total (636.57 km2)
contained within the Dallmann Bay ASPA (ATCM 2021a, ATCM
2021b, Australia et al. 2019b). The Antarctic Peninsula (included
ice-covered areas) is around 522,000 km2(Bindschadler 2006).
While it is difficult to estimate the footprint of Antarctic tourism in
the Antarctic Peninsula area, a peer-reviewed study calculating the
comparative spatial human footprint of a range of human activities
in Antarctica, including tourism, provides an empirical basis on
which to make such an estimate. Pertierra et al. (2017), estimated
the relative human influence across a range of land uses in
Antarctica, including scientific stations, tourism sites and protected
areas, With respect to landing sites visited by tourists, they inferred
that a surrounding area with a radius of 0.5 km from the landing
site coordinates was exposed to “high” human influence (9 out of
10 in their
scale), while an area with a radius of 2.5 km from the same
coordinates (19.63 km2) experienced a “moderate” human
influence (5 out of 10). Based on Sanderson et al.(2002) Pertierra et
al (2017) used a scale of 0 to 10, where zero is low human
influence and 10 is high,
To estimate the area of the Antarctic Peninsula exposed to a
“moderate” human influence (footprint) from tourism in a single
season, we have multiplied the proposed affected area around each
landing site (19.63 km2) by the number of landing sites visited in
the 2022/23 tourism season (208 sites; IAATO 2023b).
The result is 4,083 km2 This area of “moderate human influence”
contains a zone of “high human influence” with a radius of 500
metres - an area of 163 km2., which means that area with a
“moderate” tourism influence in the region is 323% larger than the
area protected within ASPAs (1,266 km2). This preliminary
estimate suggests that there is a need to balance the footprint of
tourism with increased spatial protection in ice free areas in the
Antarctic Peninsula.
Discussion: the way forward
Ultimately, the objective of managing tourism should be to
minimize its environmental impact and protect Antarctica’s
biodiversity values in line with the Protocol. While using existing
approaches such as managing impacts at specific sites have some
effect, such actions do not result in the achievement of
environmental protection on a meaningful spatial scale. Achieving
this objective requires the ATCM to “zoom out” from individual
sites, assess on a larger spatial scale what needs to be protected, and
then decide how to manage tourism to achieve that. Below we
suggest some mechanisms to achieve this.
Systematic conservation planning
ASOC has previously recommended that the ATCM address both
existing and future tourism by expanding the network of ASPAs (see
inter alia ASOC 2019a, ASOC 2019b, ASOC 2022). This approach
would not only rectify a situation in which Antarctica’s protected
areas system is inadequate to protect biodiversity (Shaw et al.
2014) but would enable a more systematic and regional approach to
planning visitation, rather than the current site-by-site, ad hoc
approach.
For this reason, ASOC strongly recommends that some form of
formal systematic conservation planning (SCP) SCP has previously
been discussed in the context of expanding the protected areas
system (Australia et al. 2019a) and IAATO and SCAR have
collaborated on their own SCP process (Lee et al., 2024). (Margules
and Pressey 2000) be an integral part of the new comprehensive
framework. A wealth of information on Antarctica’s biodiversity
and the current human footprint is available to support an SCP
process, including Antarctic Environmental Domains, Antarctic
Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs), Important Bird Areas
(IBAs), Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMAs), among others.
This data can assist the ATCM to identify areas of high conservation
value, understand where current tourist activity is taking place, and
use this information to develop an overall plan for which areas
should receive additional protection and which areas should remain
open to visitation. Additional measures will of course be required to
manage visited areas. However, taking the time to develop this
regional picture is an essential step if the management of Antarctic
tourism is to be truly comprehensive and effective.
Furthermore, to avoid duplication of effort, it would be useful to
build on the results of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research (SCAR) – International Association of Antarctica Tour
Operators (IAATO) SCP process. The results of the first phase of that
work have just been published and have already identified features
of value to biodiversity, science, and tourism (Lee et al. 2024),
which could be considered in an ATCM conservation planning
process for the region.
ASOC acknowledges that the outcomes of the SCP process would
likely require the designation of areas on a significantly larger scale
than is typically done. Although many ASPAs are small, there are 9
already designated ASPAs with an area of >100 km2, and the
largest ASPA is 960 km2 (Australia, Czech Republic, SCAR and
United States 2019b). Most tourism and biodiversity is concentrated
in ice-free areas. Around 20% of the Antarctic Peninsula is ice-free,
or about 104,400km2. The Antarctic Peninsula (included ice-
covered areas) is around 522,000 km2 (Binschadler 2006). This
might present several issues, including how to manage these areas,
which already takes a significant amount of time and effort on the
part of ATCPs.
Nevertheless, changing this system to make it possible to designate
a number of larger ASPAs and ASMAs would be far more feasible
and effective than trying to manage more than 200 sites
individually.
Global targets
To develop a systematic approach towards managing the tourism
footprint, ASOC recommends that the ATCM first implement
practical targets for spatial protection in line with global
commitments. One example is the Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework, which aspires to protect at least 30% of
terrestrial, coastal, and marine areas by 2030 See Kunming-
Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, Target 3. .
On the Antarctic Peninsula, management actions should
additionally include a percentage of sites where visits are not
allowed, serving both as control sites for monitoring tourism effects
and for precautionary biodiversity protection.
Use of available protection tools
In parallel to establishing targets, completing a systematic
conservation planning process, and identifying new protected areas,
the ATCM will need new management approaches for visited sites
using the available tools of ASMAs, ASPAs, and EIAs. It may be
necessary to implement some of these on an interim basis to restrict
the expansion of the tourism footprint before more detailed
management measures can be agreed through the comprehensive
framework and systematic conservation planning.
ASOC suggests that a relatively expeditious option would be the
establishment of large regional ASMAs solely focused on managing
tourism. The management plans of those ASMAs could determine
landing sites, traffic routes, and the like. For instance, in the
Deception Island ASMA there are in principle four sites where
tourism landings can take place, and a fifth site where yachts can
anchor.
Site management
ASOC additionally recommends that the comprehensive framework
discussions should develop binding regulations that apply generally
to all sites or certain categories of sites. This would further enhance
comprehensive environmental protection. This could include:
Enacting requirements for gaining approval to visit new sites (as
discussed in WP 004, WP 024 and WP 060 submitted to this
meeting)
Determining precautionary limits on the number of visitors who can
visit any site.
Limiting the number of visits per day (WP 004)
Limiting the season for when sites can be visited (WP 004)
Recommendations
In summary, ASOC recommends that, as part of developing a
comprehensive framework for the management of tourism, the
ATCM:
Undertake a systematic conservation planning process for the
Antarctic Peninsula.
Implement practical targets for spatial protection in line with global
commitments and aim to protect at least 30% of terrestrial, coastal,
and marine areas by 2030.
Develop new management approaches that use existing tools,
including ASPAs, ASMAs, and EIAs, to manage visited sites,
including using interim measures while the discussion on the
comprehensive framework is ongoing.
Develop binding regulations that apply generally to all visited sites
or to categories of sites.
