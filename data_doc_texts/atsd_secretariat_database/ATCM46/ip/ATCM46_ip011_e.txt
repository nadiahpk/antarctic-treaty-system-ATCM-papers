Portugal and the Antarctic Treaty: review since 2010
Portugal and the Antarctic Treaty: review since 2010
Information Paper submitted by Portugal
Summary
Portugal ratified the Antarctic Treaty in 2010 and the Madrid
Protocol in 2014. Portugal has contributed 45 policy papers at the
ATCM, being submitted with other 32 Parties, Observers and
Experts, notably the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Belgium, Spain,
Brazil, Germany and Chile. Portugal has co-led, with other Parties,
on Antarctic education and outreach, international research
initiative, environmental conservation and climate change, being
engaged at the ATCM and CEP discussions. Portugal is active in the
Subsidiary Group on Climate Change Response and the
Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach and aims
to provide valuable constructive contributions to the Antarctic
Treaty System in the future.
Introduction
Historically, Portugal is associated with the Antarctic region: Fernão
de Magalhães (known in Spanish as Fernando/Hernando de
Magallanes and as Ferdinand Magellan in English) is one of the first
explorers mentioned when talking about the beginnings of
Antarctica (Terra incognita) (Walton 2013). Recently, it has been
noted that Portuguese have been in 10 out of the 19 sub-Antarctic
and Antarctic islands (E.g. South Shetland Islands, Iles Kerguelen,
Ile Amsterdam) since the XVI century on discovery, sealing, whaling
expeditions (Headland 2023). With the upsurge of the International
Polar Year in 2007-08, Portugal has established itself through
scientific activities with other State parties to the Antarctic Treaty,
enabling the establishment of the Portuguese Polar Program
(PROPOLAR) and successful educational programs. PROPOLAR has
provided logistical support to the development of polar science in
Portugal, with key research activities focused particularly on
marine, permafrost and cryosphere, terrestrial, atmospheric, and
social sciences (Portugal 2015). Portugal had a 70% increase in
research papers (from 1990´s up to 2016), being in the middle of
the range of the State parties to the Antarctic Treaty in terms of the
total number of papers published (Xavier et al. 2018, Xavier et al.
2023). Most of the research papers were written by scientists who
are nationals of several countries—with colleagues from the United
Kingdom, Spain, the United States of America, Brazil, and Germany
—with only 10% of the research papers being written exclusively by
Portuguese scientists.
Portugal acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in 2010 and the Madrid
Protocol on Environmental Protection in 2014 and is currently a
non-consultative State party to the Antarctic Treaty. This
information paper aims to provide an overview of the Antarctic
activities carried out by Portugal since 2010 at the Antarctic Treaty
consultative meetings.
Portugal´s activities within the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meetings (ATCMs)
Portugal started participating with official presence at ATCMs since
2013, and has contributed with 45 policy papers at the ATCM, with
four to five papers per year since then (Figure 1). Portugal lead 62%
of these ATCM papers, being submitted with other 32 Parties
,Observers and Experts (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Canada, Chile, COMNAP, Czechia, Finland, France, Germany,
IAATO, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, New
Zealand, Malaysia, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, SCAR,
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Kingdom, United
States and WMO), in particular the United Kingdom (n=29 ATCM
papers), Bulgaria (n=20), Belgium (n=17), Spain (n=14), Brazil
(n=14), Germany (n=12) and Chile (n=12). Portugal only
submitted 3 ATCM papers alone.
Portugal has co-led, with other Parties, on issues such as Antarctic
education and outreach (E.g. POLAR WEEKS, Antarctica Day, ATCM
Workshop on Education and Outreach)(Xavier et al. 2019), engaged
in international initiatives (E.g. SCAR Horizon SCAR, EU-
POLARNET, UN Ocean Conference) (Xavier et al. 2016, Rintoul et
al. 2018), on discussions related to environmental conservation
(E.g. trace element contamination, microplastic/chemical pollution,
toxicology, monitoring issues, wastewater management) (Padeiro et
al. 2016, Bessa et al. 2019, Correia et al. 2020, Pina & Vieira 2022),
on climate change (E.g. impacts on marine organisms)(Krüger et al.
2018, Abreu et al. 2020), being engaged at the ATCM and CEP
discussions (E.g. ATCM XXXVIII/IP3, ATCMXL/IP24, ATCM XLIV/
IP2, ATCM XLII/IP70, ATCM XLII/IP10, ATCMXL/BP20). Indeed,
Portugal is active in the Subsidiary Group on Climate Change
Response and the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and
Outreach.
Figure 1. Number of ATCM papers by Portugal (Note: 2018 was a
special ATCM, with a tight agenda; 2020 there was no ATCM due to
COVID19 pandemic) BP - Background Papers; IP - Information
Papers; WP - Working Papers.
Portugal acknowledges again the ATS as an excellent forum for
international collaborations and inter-disciplinary research, science
diplomacy, education and outreach.
