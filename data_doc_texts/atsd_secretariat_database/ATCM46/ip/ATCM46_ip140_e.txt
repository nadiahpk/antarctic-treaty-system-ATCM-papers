Microplastic pollution in Antarctica: a complex challenge
Microplastic pollution in Antarctica: a complex challenge
Summary
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
contains relatively limited provisions related to the prevention of
plastic pollution. Five years ago, the ATCM adopted Resolution 5
(2019) on Reducing Plastic Pollution in Antarctica and the Southern
Ocean. This Resolution represents a positive development, which
can be expanded upon to address the growing environmental
problem of plastic pollution in Antarctica.
Additionally, ASOC recommends that the ATCM take further action
to address the problem of plastic pollution in the Antarctic Treaty
Area, including: considering the development of an action plan on
plastic pollution, considering a review of provisions related to the
management of plastic pollution in the Environmental Protocol,
encouraging cooperation to reduce the use of plastic in Antarctica,
and supporting global initiatives to address the problem of plastic
pollution.
Background
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
contains relatively limited provisions related to the prevention of
plastic pollution. Resolution 5 (2019), on Reducing Plastic Pollution
in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean represents a positive
development, which can be expanded upon to address the growing
environmental problem of plastic pollution in Antarctica.
ASOC has previously tabled papers on the issue of plastic pollution
to the ATCM and CCAMLR, which summarized existing research on
plastic pollution in Antarctic waters attributable to local sources.
This paper focuses primarily on microplastic pollution detected in
the Southern Ocean and Antarctic ice and biota.
Introduction to microplastics
Microplastics An IP presented by SCAR to the 45th ATCM
summarised available information on the occurrence of
macroplastics (> 5 mm), microplastics (1 µm-5 mm) and
nanoplastics (< 1 µm) in Antarctica (SCAR 2023). are pieces of
plastic which are smaller than 5mm in diameter, but larger than 1
micrometer (µm). They are a type of synthetic polymer, which was
first identified and described in the 1960s (GESAMP, 2015) and
have since been detected in the ocean, atmosphere, and the
digestive tracts and feces of living organisms.
Microplastics come from a range of marine and terrestrial sources,
including wastewater, which may contain microplastic fibers and
fragments from laundry water and microbeads from personal
hygiene products. They also originate from the breakdown of larger
macroplastic items, such as abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing
gear, marine plastic pellets, ropes, paints, and antifouling systems
(Yang et al., 2021).
Microplastic pollution in Antarctica
The presence of microplastics in the Southern Ocean, Antarctic
snow and ice, and the digestive tracts and feces of seabirds has been
well-documented in recent years. Scientific research has identified
microplastic pollution in: coastal seawater samples collected in the
Antarctic Peninsula region (Lacerda et al., 2019), snow samples in
the Ross Island region (Aves et al, 2022), and 15-30% of tested
faecal samples from penguin species (Adélie, king, gentoo and
chinstrap) across the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic (Fragão et al,
2021). High concentrations of microplastics have also been found
every sample of Laternula elliptica, a species of clam, tested in the
waters around King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands
(González-Aravena et al, 2024). A synthesis of scientific literature
from the late 1980s to 2023 on the ingestion of micro and
nanoplastics by seabirds from polar regions reported that of the 756
Antarctic birds sampled, 97% had at least one microplastic
fragment or fibre in their stomach contents or pellets (regurgitated
undigested food), with 100% of pellet samples containing
microplastics.
Impacts of microplastics on Antarctic biota
Microplastics can be ingested by living organisms, with planktonic
suspension and filter feeders, such as Antarctic krill, identified as
particularly vulnerable due to their method of feeding (Dawson et
al., 2018). This may be exacerbated by sea ice dynamics, which
could further encourage the uptake of microplastics by algae and
Antarctic krill (Rota et al., 2022). Once ingested, microplastics can
have toxicological effects on keystone species, with impacts that
affect entire marine ecosystems, including through bioaccumulation
and biomagnification (Waller et al., 2017). Microplastics may also
act as a vector for pathogenic bacteria (Caruso et al., 2022), and
can further degrade to become nanoplastics.
Nanoplastics (< 1 µm) are the most recently reported type of
minuscule plastic pollution in Antarctica It is likely that the unique
and extreme environment of the Southern Ocean may contribute to
the rapid breakdown of macroplastics into micro and nanoplastics,
increasing their potential risk to Antarctic species and ecosystems
(SCAR 2023).. They can cross biological barriers due to their size
and high surface reactivity, with adverse toxicological effects. It is
likely that the unique and extreme environment of the Southern
Ocean contributes to the rapid breakdown of macroplastics into
micro and nanoplastics, increasing their potential risk to Antarctic
species and ecosystems (SCAR 2023). Furthermore, research
suggests that the digestive processes of Antarctic krill may play a
role in the degradation of microplastics to nanoplastics (Dawson et
al., 2018).
Plastic pollution and the ATCM: the current approach
Some plastic fibers and debris detected in the Antarctic
environment originate from distant sources (Isobe et al. 2017) and
microplastics are known to travel in air and dust clouds from land
and over sea (Cunningham et al., 2022). However, a recent paper
reports that local operations, such as research stations, tourism,
fishing and research vessels, are the most significant sources of
plastic pollution in Antarctica (Primpke et al, 2024).
The Environmental Protocol contains some provisions of relevance
to plastic pollution:
Annex III on Waste Disposal and Management, requires removal of
plastic wastes from the Antarctic Treaty Area (Article 2).
Annex IV on Marine Pollution, which:
specifically prohibits the disposal from ships into the sea of all
plastics, including but not limited to synthetic ropes, synthetic
fishing nets and plastic garbage bags (Article 5, 1), and
prohibits untreated wastewater discharges from vessels within 12
nautical miles of the coast (Article 6, 1a) Parties are not compelled
to treat wastewater released from their scientific research station,
beyond maceration (Annex III; Article 5, 1b)..
More generally: Annex I, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),
requires Parties to undertake EIAs for all activities within the
Antarctic Treaty area, including the implementation of measures to
mitigate impacts.
The relatively limited scope of these provisions may reflect the fact
that the Environmental Protocol was adopted before the
complexities and magnitude of plastic pollution were understood.
A WP submitted to the ATCM by the United Kingdom in 2019
stated that “based on estimated levels, microplastic pollution
released into the Antarctic Treaty area from ships and scientific
research stations are likely to be negligible at the scale of the
Southern Ocean. However, levels of microplastic pollution may be
significant on a local scale, for example, in the vicinity of research
stations” (Munari et al., 2017; Waller et al., 2017; Reed et al 2018
cited in UK WP 2019).
In 2019, acknowledging the responsibility to protect Antarctica
from plastic pollution, the ATCM adopted Resolution 5 (2019) on
Reducing Plastic Pollution in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
The Resolution recommends inter alia reductions in the use of
personal care products containing microplastic beads, information
exchanges between Parties on minimizing microplastics in
wastewater, and invites SCAR to report on new information about
the presence and risks of plastic pollution. It calls for greater
monitoring of plastic pollution in Antarctica and recommends that
the issue of microplastic release be considered in connection with
any possible future revisions of Annexes III and IV to the Protocol
on Environmental Protection.
Current Practices in Antarctica
Commercial fishing and tour operators in the Antarctic are taking
positive steps to reduce their plastic pollution. Some fishing vessels
have installed laundry filters to prevent the discharge of
microplastic fibers in laundry water (ASOC and COLTO 2018).
IAATO is working to eliminate plastics from its members’
operations, adding the CCAMLR Marine Debris Form and ATCM
Resolution 5 (2019) to their Field Operations Manual, and creating
new guidelines for visitors about reducing waste while traveling.
Members of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic
Programs (COMNAP) have also taken steps to address this issue.
COMNAP’s Environmental Protection Expert Group has published
recommendations to reduce the use of unnecessary plastic in the
Treaty Area, such as banning personal care products containing
microplastics and exploring ways to prevent microplastics from
clothing from entering the Antarctic environment.
Global regulation of plastic pollution
There are two notable international efforts currently in progress to
address the global problem of plastic pollution. In 2021 the
International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Marine Environment
Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted a Strategy to reduce marine
plastic pollution from ships, with a vision of achieving “zero plastic
waste discharges to sea from ships by 2025.” IMO (2021) Strategy
to Address Marine Plastic Litter From Ships. MEPC 77/16/Add.1,
Annex 2.
In March 2022 the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)
adopted a Resolution to establish a legally binding Global Plastics
Treaty by the end of 2024. An Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee (INC) has begun work to produce a draft of the Treaty,
which is scheduled to be complete in December 2024. This
commitment to the development of a Global Plastic Treaty indicates
the importance of this issue as a global environmental threat that
requires focused and determined action.
Conclusion and recommendations
Plastic pollution poses a serious, emerging threat to Antarctic and
Southern Ocean ecosystems, particularly through the poorly
understood pathways of ingestion, bioaccumulation, and
biomagnification of microplastics and nanoplastics. More
information is needed to understand the real impact of plastic
pollution in Antarctica, as well as its sources, however this should
not be a reason for delayed action. Precautionary action may be
required.
ASOC therefore recommends that ATCPs:
Consider the development of an action plan on plastic pollution,
including microplastics from both land-based and ship-based
sources.
Encourage stakeholders to exchange information on current policies
and practices being implemented at the national level to reduce the
use and disposal of plastic in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
Consider a review of provisions related to the reduction of plastic
pollution in the Environmental Protocol.
Support global initiatives to address the problem of plastic
pollution, including the IMO Strategy to reduce marine plastic
pollution from ships.
