Advances in the climate change sensor network on the Antarctic
Peninsula
Summary
The purpose of this report is to present the status of progress in the
installation of the Multiparameter Station Network in Antarctica
and obtain environmental data developed by the Chilean Antarctic
Institute (INACH), which is also seeking to open space for future
international collaborations on the matter.
Background
Antarctica is emerging as the natural laboratory with the greatest
potential for research and registration of environmental parameters
that make it possible to study global climate change, a phenomenon
that directly threatens humanity. For this task, a lot of information
and scientific evidence is required, which still remains at
underdeveloped levels. This reality forces the National Antarctic
Programmes to carry out strategic actions to improve the
monitoring of environmental variables and becomes an opportunity
to achieve this collaboratively for the benefit of Antarctic sciences.
Through the Chilean Antarctic Institute, Chile carries out the
Latitudinal Sensors Programme (LSP). This project materialises the
country's southernmost set of monitoring platforms with permanent
sensors. This is a powerful tool to better understand the dynamics
of Antarctic ecosystems and, in turn, confront global climate change
through information and scientific evidence. It is known that
Antarctica interacts climatically with the other areas of the planet
and is emerging as a “sentinel" of the impact of its changes. The
flow of carbon, levels of greenhouse gases, the rates of increase in
atmospheric and oceanic temperatures, and the ablation of the
cryosphere are some of the phenomena that can be studied through
this type of monitoring network.
The network seeks to take advantage of the natural laboratory
characteristics of the Antarctic Peninsula to record long-term
measurements of atmospheric and oceanographic variables by
installing monitoring stations composed of different sensors
conditioned for the characteristics of the White Continent.
Finally, the objective of the programme is to provide environmental
data of the Antarctic territory, seeking to improve the
understanding, prediction and projection of its effects through the
generation of relevant, real-time information. All this in support of
decision-making in various areas (scientific, political, productive,
risk assessment, among others).
Project progress
The PSL is focused on implementing a Network of Multiparametric
Stations in Antarctica, i.e. an integrated environmental monitoring
system in the Antarctic territory that makes it possible to study
environmental variations at different time scales (seasonal,
interannual fluctuations). This network aims to install stations in 21
points and thus provide data from Antarctica to the rest of the
world publicly and free of charge, to have relevant and real-time
information.
To date, 13 Automatic Meteorological Stations (EMA) have been
installed out of a total of 18 planned. On the other hand, INACH
has already acquired a glider to monitor different variables in the
Southern Ocean, in addition to planning in the future to incorporate
2 oceanographic buoys, which in total add up to 21 multiparametric
stations in the network.
Antarctic Scientific Expedition 58 – Summer period 2021-2022
During December 2021, the first Automatic Meteorological Station
belonging to the network was installed, located approximately 1000
km from the south pole, adjacent to the Union Glacier Joint Station
(lat 79°46'S, long 82°50'W). From December 2021 to February 2022,
work was carried out on the Antarctic peninsula to install
monitoring EMAs on the Prof. Julio Escudero base, located in Fildes
Bay in the South Shetland Islands lat 62°12'10.34" S, long 58°57'
42.72"W), and then sail south across the Antarctic circle,
disembarking at Teniente Luis Carvajal base, located at the southern
end of Adelaida Island (lat 67°45'36.71"S, long 68°54'56.12"W), to
finish a little further north at the Yelcho Base, located on Doumer
Island, Palmer Archipelago (lat 64°52'42.50"S, long 63°35'28.54"W).
Antarctic Scientific Expedition 59 – Summer period 2022-2023
From December 2022 to February 2023, the installations of the 6
new EMAs were carried out, starting in parallel with the station
located at the General Bernardo O'Higgins base, which is located on
Isabel Riquelme Islet, northern area of the Antarctica peninsula (lat
63°19'16.95"S, long 57°53'58.99"W) and the station installed in
Melville Cape, located on King George Island and being the station
belonging to the most northerly network (lat 62°1'27.07"S, long
57°36'4.98"W). Then work continued in parallel at the stations at
Capitán Arturo Prat base, located in Discovery Bay, Greenwich
Island (lat 62°28'47.43"S, long 59°39'59.33"W) and in Harmony
Point, located on Nelson Island in the South Shetland Islands (lat
62°18'21.64"S, long 59°11'44.51"W). Finally, during the expeditions
two other stations were installed in parallel: one located adjacent to
the General Jorge Boonen Rivera shelter, located in Duse Bay, in
the northern part of the Peninsula (lat 63°32'12.52"S, long
57°24'14.17"W) and the last one installed was at the President
Gabriel González Videla base, located in Paradise Bay, on the shores
of Gerlache Strait (lat 64°49'26.65"S, long 62°51'28.47"W).
Antarctic Scientific Expedition 60 – Summer period 2023-2024
During the last Antarctic Scientific Expedition, between the months
of December 2023 and January 2024, the most recent installations
that are part of the network were carried out. The first of these
stations was installed in D'Hainaut Island, which is located in the
southern part of the Trinidad Island, belonging to the Palmer
archipelago (lat 63°54'11.04"S, long 60°47'37.81"W), to then
continue with the installation of the Alcock Island station, located
in the northern part of the Gerlache Strait (lat 64°14'23.89"S, long
61°7'53.21"W). Finally, the station located on Livingston Island (lat
62°40'47.72"S, long 60°24'44.36"W).

Where can the data of the already installed stations be seen?
The data and information generated by the network are public and
freely accessible. Currently, they are available on the web platform
which can be accessed at http://www.redsensoresinach.cl/. This
platform contains project information, metadata, statistical graphs,
visualisation and downloading of the different variables that are
recorded on site and transmitted by satellite 4 times a day.

First contributions to science: record of an atmospheric river on the
Antarctic Peninsula
On 5 February 2024, several stations belonging to this network
recorded a rise in air temperature that contrasts with the average
temperatures recorded in that area over the years. More
specifically, the weather station located at the Gabriel González
Videla base (lat 64°49'26.65"S, long 62°51'28.47"W) recorded a
temperature of 10.9°C, reaffirmed by the record of the Ukrainian
Vernadsky base located 82 km away from the Chilean base, which
recorded a temperature of 10.8°C. This evidences the presence of an
atmospheric river in the Antarctic Peninsula, which confirms and
reinforces the importance of having a permanent monitoring
network of meteorological variables throughout the Peninsula.

Environmental Monitoring Laboratory
The Environmental Monitoring Laboratory has been implemented to
design and develop prototypes, maintenance and repairs for
components of the grid or any other project focused on research
and science.
Furthermore, it allows us to maintain constant monitoring of the
stations and perform sensor calibrations in an environment with
controlled environmental conditions.
Objectives and challenges in the medium term
Considering that the network grows in the number of stations
installed year after year and with the objective of monitoring
climatic conditions of the continent on an extensive and significant
latitudinal gradient, the new stations will be installed at key points
that allow us to collect data from areas that are currently not
covered.
One of the points raised on which to make progress is Elephant
Island, which would allow us to obtain measurements from the
northernmost point of the Antarctic continent. On the other hand,
points inside the Antarctic Circle are being evaluated, without
ruling out the option of this being done through collaboration
projects with other National Antarctic Programmes.
Another objective is the intensive use of data obtained by the
network and possible research or collaborations that can be
developed with other countries.
