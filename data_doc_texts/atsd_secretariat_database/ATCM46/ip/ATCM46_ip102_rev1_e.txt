IAATO Overview of Antarctic Vessel Tourism: The 2023-24 Season,
and Preliminary Estimates for 2024-25
IAATO Overview of Antarctic Vessel Tourism: The 2023-24 Season,
and Preliminary Estimates for 2024-25
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide the statistical data compiled from Post
Visit Reports for the 2023-24 season and the preliminary estimates
for 2024-25 season as of 08 May 2024.
We also take this opportunity to build on discussions with different
Treaty Parties around growth and diversification of activities, by
including a historical perspective which may aid ongoing
considerations. The data presented throughout this paper is based
on information provided to IAATO by its Operators in Post Visit
Reports (PVRs). Visitor numbers reflect only those travelling with
IAATO Operator companies and do not include Observers,
Government Officials, or those individuals taking part in research
projects that are being supported by IAATO Operators. It also does
not include information from any non-IAATO operators.
IAATO’s membership continues to encompass the majority of
private-sector tour operators. All IAATO Operator activities in
Antarctica are permitted or authorized by Competent Authorities
through Environmental Impact Assessments (or equivalent),
Advance Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management
Permits, submitted in advance of the season. IAATO operators strive
for safe and responsible operations in the Antarctic Treaty area and
plan activities that will have no more than a minor or transitory
environmental impact. For further information on IAATO Activities
see ATCM 46 (2024) IP107 A Catalogue of IAATO Operator
Activities.
1.0 Historical Overview on Managing for Growth
1.1 IAATO Member Activities and Managing for Growth
The growth of the Antarctic tourism industry is a topic of great
interest within the Antarctic and worldwide communities. In past
three decades, IAATO has seen several periods of growth. During
each of these periods of growth, and in the intervening breaks,
IAATO has implemented a series of tourism management measures,
many of which were subsequently adopted by the ATCPs. With
advancements in technology, reporting and communications, and
building on lessons learned in the past, IAATO has been able to
accurately forecast and monitor growth, making measured decisions
and advancements to properly position the organization as changes
happen, and be fleet-of-foot to respond as appropriate.
As forecasted in ATCM XLV (2023) IP156 IAATO Overview of
Antarctic Vessel Tourism: The 2022-23 Season, and Preliminary
Estimates for 2023-24, the 2023-24 activity levels exceeded the
2022-23 season. Anticipating the continued increase in numbers of
passengers and vessels, IAATO continues to strengthen, test, and
refine its suite of ‘tools’ to ensure the continued successful
management of activities such as those listed in ATCM 46 (2024)
IP101 IAATO Annual Report.
It was decided at ATCM XLV “to start a dedicated process to
develop a comprehensive and consistent. framework for the
regulation of tourism and other non-governmental activities in
Antarctica” (Decision 6 (2023)). IAATO looks forward to
collaborating around tourism management as discussions on the
development of a comprehensive and consistent framework for
Antarctic tourism and other non-governmental activities continue.
For further information see IP111 IAATO Considerations During the
Development of a Tourism Framework.
Incremental changes on existing tools have been made during the
past ten years to address the continued increase in activities.
Figures 1.1 – 1.3 give an overview of some of the key growth
management tools introduced by IAATO during periods of growth
between 1993-Present.

response to growth between 1993 and 2001

response to growth between 2001 and 2011
Figure 1.3: IAATO management tools introduced in response to
growth between 2011 – Present (2020-21 season excluded).
1.2 IAATO Member Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more
than 200 different nationalities were represented by tourists who
visited the Antarctic during the 2023-24 season. Table 1. offers a
summary of the 2023-24 season nationalities by percentage.

Reflecting on the latest period of growth, 2014-2023, the Post Visit
Reports submitted to IAATO indicate the top 10 nationalities who
visited Antarctica have remained relatively consistent over the last
ten seasons, although proportionately and prior to the pandemic,
China had seen the greatest increase in travelers to Antarctica. An
overview of the last 10 years can be found in Figure 2.

2.0 IAATO Vessel Operations Overview
This section focuses on IAATO Vessel Operations and includes yacht
activities.
For Deep Field and Air Operator information please refer to ATCM
46 (2024) IP103 IAATO Deep Field and Air Overview of Antarctic
Tourism: 2023-24 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2024-25
Season.
2.1 IAATO Vessel Activities
For the last 31 years shipborne tourism on the Peninsula has been
the dominant vector of travel. The vast majority of tourism voyages
(98%) operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the seven-
month austral summer season (from October to April), and depart
from Ushuaia, Argentina or, to a lesser extent, from other ports
north of the Antarctic Treaty Area.
During the 2023-24 season, all commercial SOLAS passenger ship
Operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area
were members of IAATO.
Table 2. offers a summary of the last decade 2013-2023 of both
IAATO SOLAS and non-SOLAS vessel tourism (including Yachts and
Cruise Only).

In accordance with IAATO Bylaws Article X – Section B, all
Operators and Provisional Operators are to comply with operational
conditions pursuant to the Antarctic Treaty System, including the
Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
the Antarctic Treaty, along with IMO Conventions and similar
international and national laws and agreements.
2.2 Scope of IAATO Vessel Activities
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small
inflatable boats (Zodiac, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a
lesser extent activity such as, but not limited to, kayaking, climbing,
and short overnight stays.
Through the years descriptions and the type of activities have been
expanded in the Post Visit Reports to facilitate greater accuracy for
reporting and planning. For instance, RPAS Flights, although
banned recreationally in coastal waters by IAATO, has been
expanded to differentiate between commercial, scientific, and
operational/navigation flights. Likewise, what was once described
as swimming, has now been expanded to swimming – distance and
polar plunge.
Representing the current expansion of descriptions during this last
period of growth, Figure 3 illustrates activities offered by IAATO
vessels including yachts, during the 2023-2024 season. Small boat
cruising and landings remain the most popular activities (24%) for
vessels, while scenic ship cruising also remains a key activity. A
range of other activities (e.g., kayaking, and short overnight stays)
contribute to a smaller portion (10%) of off-ship activities. It is
anticipated that ship cruising, small boat cruising and small boat
landings will continue to be the dominant activities and other
activities will remain small scale in comparison.
For more information on IAATO Operator activities see ATCM 46
(2024) IP107 A Catalogue of IAATO Operator Activities.

Expedition Vessels and Yachts for 2023-24
4.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Vessel Activities for the
2024-25 Season
Preliminary estimates for Vessels, found in Appendix 2, for the
2024-25 season are as of 08 May, 2024. These estimates represent
the anticipated operating scenario for the 2024-25 season.
5.0 Tourism Statistics
IAATO has been collating data from its members regarding visits to
Antarctica for three decades.  During that time, changes have been
made in the data collected which encompass more detailed activity
categories as well as updates to site names.  Until recent years, the
collating was done manually.  Increased capabilities in technology
have allowed large data sets to be analyzed more effectively and
quicker than previously possible.  This has brought to IAATO’s
attention certain anomalies in the data (i.e. terrestrial landings at
marine only sites).  Therefore IAATO strongly recommends users to
utilize the most recent information available from IAATO when
performing analysis.
