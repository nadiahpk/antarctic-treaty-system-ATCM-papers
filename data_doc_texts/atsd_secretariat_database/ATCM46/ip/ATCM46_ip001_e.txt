Summary
In support of the goal to improve SAR coordination and response in
the Antarctic Treaty area, COMNAP convened the Antarctic SAR
Workshop 5 (2023) in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, on 23–24 June

Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and the Australian
Antarctic Division (AAD).
Background
Under international maritime and aeronautical agreements, the
Rescue Coordination Centres (RCCs) of five countries (Argentina,
Australia, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa) share responsibility
for the coordination of SAR over the Antarctic Treaty region.
The RCCs rely on the cooperation of National Antarctic Programs
and others in an Antarctic SAR situation and there are a range of
informal and formal agreements in place to facilitate these
activities.
Noting ATCM XXXVI Resolution 4 (2013) Improved Collaboration
on Search and Rescue (SAR) in Antarctica, in particular,
recommendation 7a, which recommends that the Parties:
“support COMNAP to continue to foster collaborative discussions
and vital sharing of information regarding SAR matters including
through: holding triennial workshops on search and rescue, that
include representatives of the RCCs, National Antarctic Programs,
relevant experts, private operators as well as commercial emergency
notification service providers, and inform future ATCMs on the
results of these workshops;”.
The COMNAP Antarctic SAR Workshop 5 had persons involved
from RCCs with Antarctic coordination responsibilities, National
Antarctic Programs, relevant experts including from the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) and
the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources (CCAMLR), as well as commercial operators and service
