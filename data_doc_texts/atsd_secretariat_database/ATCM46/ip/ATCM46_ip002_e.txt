First results on the content of microplastic in soils and freshwater of
East Antarctica
Information paper submitted by the Republic of Belarus
Summary
The paper draw attention to the first data on the content of
microplastic particles in the soils and freshwater of East Antarctica
recently obtained (on an example of the Vecherny Oasis, Thala
Hills, Enderby Land).
The presence of microplastic particles in the various natural
components of Antarctica and Southern Ocean and their entering
into the bodies of marine and terrestrial fauna has been recently
shown, confirming the danger of circulation of this type of
pollutant. Therefore, the attention to the plastic and microplastic
pollution in the region and connected consequences for unique
polar ecosystems and biota is increasing. At the last 4 ATCMs seven
IP and BP documents devoted to this problem were presented
(ATCM45 IP078, ATCM44 IP068, ATCM44 IP001, ATCM44 BP013,
ATCM42 IP133, ATCM42 IP009, ATCM42 IP033). But the level of
knowledge of microplastic pollution in Antarctica generally low and
uneven; East Antarctica remains mostly uninvestigated on this issue.
The purpose of the study is to obtain the first estimates of the
content of microplastic particles (less than 5 mm) in the soils and
freshwater bodies of the Vecherny Oasis, Enderby Land.
The samples of soil and freshwater taken during 14th (2021/2022)
and 15th (2022/2023) Belarusian Antarctic Expeditions were
analysed. The technique for isolating microplastic particles from
soil included density separation in zinc chloride solution,
centrifugation, vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters. The
freshwater from three lakes and one temporary reservoir to
concentrate the sample in the field conditions was filtered through
a plankton network and than in the laboratory - throuth White
Ribbon filters. Filters were dried and delivered into Belarus.
Quantification of microplastic particles in soil and water was
carried out using a microscope, digital camera and advisory
software. After obtaining images of all particles from the surface of
all filters, they were counted with the separation into irregularly
shaped fragments, films, and fibers. The color of the particles and
their size were recorded.
Further researches for better understanding of microplastic
pollution, its accumulation and migration taking into account
different types of its sources, geographical and landscapes
peculiarities of Antarctic oases as well as terrestrial and aquatic
system properties and geochemical processes in cold climate are
needed. Various plastic sources within scientific stations, types of
polymers and their hazardous additives as well as the processes of
building, infrastructure and transport destruction (coating,
cladding, insulation etc.) should be taken into account.
This work was implemented in the framework of the National
Antarctic Program of Belarus for 2021-2025. The methods of
investigation and the results obtained were recently published
(Kukharchyk et al., 2024; Kakareka et al., 2024).
