IAATO Overview of Deep Field and Air Tourism: the 2023-24
Season, and Preliminary Estimates for 2024-25
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide the statistical data compiled from Deep
Field and Air Operator Post Visit Reports for the 2023-24 season
and the preliminary estimates for 2024-25 season as of 08 May,
2024.
We take this opportunity to add historical and current perspectives
to discussions with different Treaty Parties around growth and
diversification of Deep Field and Air activities, which may aid
ongoing considerations. The data presented throughout this paper
are based on information provided to IAATO by its Deep Field and
Air Operators in Post Visit Reports (DF PVRs). Visitor numbers
reflect only those travelling with IAATO Operators and do not
include Observers, Government Officials, or those individuals taking
part in research projects that are being supported by Deep Field and
Air Operators. It does not include information from any non-IAATO
operators, nor does it include information about IAATO Operator
support of National Antarctic Programs (NAPs).
It should be noted at the outset that the worldwide SARS-CoV-2
pandemic has had a significant impact on Antarctic private sector
travel and consequently the historical numbers reported in this
paper. Specifically, we draw attention to the fact that:
The 2020-2021 season, during the height of the pandemic, was not
a representative season for IAATO the 2020-2021 data has been
omitted from overall reporting in this paper.
IAATO’s Deep Field and Air Operators encompass private-sector
flight and vehicle tour operators. Operator activities are permitted
or authorized through Environmental Impact Assessments, Advance
Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management Permits, and
submitted in advance of the season to Competent Authorities.
Deep field and air activities commenced towards the end of the
1980s, although there were exceptional one-off expeditions prior to
this period, e.g. Transglobe Expedition (1980–81); and In the
Footsteps of Scott (1984–1987). Deep Field and Air activities as
they are today, that follow ATCM, COMNAP and IAATO policies
and guidelines, have been authorized and conducted on expeditions
since the 1990’s. All IAATO Operators are committed to conducting
their operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner,
and all activities are planned to have no more than a minor or
transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
1.0 IAATO Deep Field and Air Operations Overview
This section focuses on IAATO Deep Field and Air Operations.

Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2024-25 Season.
1.1 IAATO Deep Field and Air Operators and areas of operation
IAATO members currently include five Operators who conduct deep
field and air tourism activities, and one air Operator that supports
air-cruise operations and single- or multi-day Antarctic experiences
in the South Shetland Islands.
Table 1 provides an overview of Deep Field and Air Operators main
areas of seasonal operation/base camp. Deep Field and Air
Operators also utilize seasonal satellite field camps and runways for
their different activities and flights.
Figure 1 provides a pictorial view of the areas of operation. Deep
Field and Air Operator site and/or expedition route information is
submitted in advance of the season to Competent Authorities, and
activities are reported in Operator PVRs and/or through Competent
Authority annual activity report requirements.
Figure 2 gives an overview of the deep field and air client numbers
for the last decade. Table 2 offers additional information about
Deep Field and Air activities as well as a graphical representation of
the table.

Figure 1: Deep Field and Air Primary Areas of Operation
Figure 2: Deep Field and Air Operator Clients 2013-2023 (excluding
Pandemic Season 2020-21)
Deep Field and Air Operators make up roughly 1% of all visitors to
Antarctica. The Operators usually maintain a higher client to staff
ratio than is typical for vessel-based tourism, often one guide to
every three clients (1:3). The exception are solo expeditions, for
example during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are
supported remotely and closely monitored daily through mandatory
communication protocols. All Deep Field Operators prepare
contingency plans for the health, safety, medical care and
evacuation for their staff and clients to meet ATCM Measure 4
(2004) Insurance and Contingency Planning for Tourism and Non-
Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area, and
Resolutions 6 (2017) Guidelines on Contingency Planning and 3
(2022) Air Safety in Antarctica.
1.2 Deep Field and Air Operator Programs and Activities
The last five seasons’ activities, including the operation of standard
programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions,
and logistical support of other expeditions, are outlined in Table 3:
Programs and Participant Numbers (clients) for 2018-23. Total
numbers participating include clients from all five IAATO Deep
Field and Air Operators. Note that some clients participated in
multiple programs. Most activities detailed below have been offered
consistently since the 1990s and have not changed during this latest
period of growth.

3.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2024-25
Season
Preliminary estimates, found in Appendix 2, for the 2024-25 season
are as of 08 May, 2024. These estimates represent the anticipated
operating scenario for the 2024-25 season.
4.0 Tourism Statistics
IAATO has been collating data from its members regarding visits to
Antarctica for three decades.  During that time, changes have been
made in the data collected which encompass more detailed activity
categories as well as updates to site names.  Until recent years, the
collating was done manually.  Increased capabilities in technology
have allowed large data sets to be analyzed more effectively and
quicker than previously possible.  This has brought to IAATO’s
attention certain anomalies in the data (i.e. terrestrial landings at
marine only sites).  Therefore, IAATO strongly recommends users to
utilize the most recent information available from IAATO when
performing analysis.
