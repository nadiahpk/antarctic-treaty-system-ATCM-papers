Southern Ocean acidification
Southern Ocean acidification
Summary
Oceans provide a vital service to the global climate system by
absorbing CO2, thereby limiting global warming, despite sharp
increases in human carbon emissions. However, such ocean carbon
absorption comes with a price: increasing CO2 emissions leads to
increasingly acidic oceans. The Southern Ocean is one of the world’s
most rapidly acidifying oceans, and organisms have already been
negatively affected by acidification. ASOC recommends that ATCPs
take action through the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) to immediately and rapidly reduce
global CO2 emissions and therefore the threat of ocean acidification
in the Southern Ocean.
Introduction
Increasing CO2 concentration leads not only to climate change, but
also to increasing rates of acidification of the world’s oceans.
Oceans provide a vital service to the global climate system by
absorbing CO2, thereby limiting global warming, despite sharp
increases in human carbon emissions. However, such ocean carbon
absorption comes with a price: when dissolved into seawater, CO2
forms carbonic acid, fundamentally changing the chemistry of the
ocean.
This phenomenon is known as ocean acidification (OA) and rates of
acidification today are faster than at any point in the past 300
million years10. By some estimates, the Southern Ocean has
absorbed up to 40% of the carbon taken up by the world’s oceans
thus far7. This makes it the planet’s largest marine carbon sink, but
also (together with Arctic waters) the most rapidly acidifying, with
shell damage already observed in the mid-2000s2. This is due to the
prevalence of high CO2 absorption by its cold waters and upwelling
of carbon-rich deep waters with already low pH values, among
other chemical factors.
Ecosystem and Economic Damage from Southern Ocean
Acidification
Nearly all Southern Ocean organisms are adapted to stable pH
conditions that have existed for several million years and are
sensitive to even small changes in seawater chemistry, especially
when these occur rapidly, allowing insufficient time for adaptation.
Ocean acidification makes it more difficult for shell-building
animals to reproduce, as well as to build and maintain their
structures. In all water-dwelling organisms, ocean acidification also
increases the energetic costs to maintain pH in cells and tissues16.
Such negative impacts have already been observed 3,4,8. Harm at
the lower end of the marine food chain will cascade towards higher
ends of the food chain, affecting larger birds and mammals and
fisheries.
There is currently no practical way for humans to reverse ocean
acidification, and acidic conditions will persist for tens of thousands
of years. Although CO2 “only” lasts for 800–1000 years in the
atmosphere, ocean processes are much slower. It will take some 30–
70,000 years to bring acidification and its impacts back to pre-
industrial levels, following the weathering of rocks on land into the
ocean10. The only way for humans to slow and eventually halt the
acidification process is through rapid CO2 emissions reductions and
future carbon dioxide removal (CDR).
Global temperatures peaking at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels
will occur at atmospheric CO2 levels of around 450ppm (today’s
level is about 425ppm), which scientists of the Inter-Academy Panel
(a consortium of national Academies of Sciences) identified in 2008
as an important threshold for serious global ocean acidification13.
This is projected to cause a 30-40% increase in polar ocean
acidification globally. However, current pledges (even if completely
fulfilled)
will result in CO2 levels above 500 ppm, and temperature increases
of around 2.1°C. At that point, acidity in the Southern Ocean will
have more than doubled compared to pre-industrial times, with
widespread areas of corrosive waters not just seasonally as today,
but year-round.
Shell damage and reduced shell building has been observed for over
a decade in some regions of the Southern Ocean, and the ability of
some vulnerable organisms to build shells declined by around 4%
between 1998 and 20148. The keystone krill species is anticipated
to be especially affected as acidification continue. Unlike in the
Arctic, krill cannot move further poleward to avoid threats from
fossil fuels such as marine warming and heatwaves, and freshening
from greater amounts of meltwater.
Warming and Freshening Compound Challenges
The Southern Ocean around Antarctica also has warmed more than
other ocean regions, in particular along the western Antarctic
Peninsula, where virtually all sea ice disappeared in the 2023
austral summer. Chilean scientists have found an increase in marine
heatwaves each decade since 1981 in regions north of the Peninsula
and in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen, Ross, and Davis Seas21. This
Southern Ocean warming seems increasingly important in overall
global ocean heat increase. In addition, as ice loss from some
portions of Antarctica accelerates – due not just to warmer air
temperatures, but warmer currents eroding ice shelves and marine-
based ice sheets – the waters around Antarctica become less saline,
a further stress on marine organisms.
OA is one of many Southern Ocean ecosystem stressors arising from
climate change, along with warming, deoxygenation and changes in
sea-ice cover and circulation. As such, a change in each of these
factors individually, or in a multitude of factors combined, directly
impacts the fitness of marine organisms and ecosystem
functioning5,6-9. Key organisms in the high-latitude Southern
Ocean ecosystem include primary producers such as diatoms; mid-
trophic level organisms such as Antarctic krill, foraminifera,
pteropods, and smaller fish (e.g., Antarctic silverfish)11-14, 20; and
upper-trophic level predators such as large fish and birds, seals,
whales, and penguins1, 18-19.
Building Resilience to Ocean Acidification
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established at the South
Orkney Islands Southern Shelf and in the Ross Sea region, with four
additional MPAs proposed in the Weddell Sea, East Antarctica and
along the western Antarctic Peninsula5-32. If realized, this network
of MPAs would protect ~60% of Antarctic shelf waters (outside of
ice-shelf cavities). By preserving genetic, species, and ecosystem
diversity through limitation or prohibition of human activities (e.g.,
fishing), the implementation of MPAs can increase resilience of
marine ecosystems to environmental change, such as those resulting
from climate change including ocean acidification12-17.
Southern Ocean ecosystems will nevertheless be at risk from the
“triple threat” of severe acidification, warming, and freshening
should fossil fuel emissions, and therefore CO2 in the atmosphere,
continue to rise well beyond the 1.5-consistent 450ppm level. The
only means to prevent this essentially permanent ecosystem damage
is rapid and aggressive fossil fuel reduction. Even “intermediate”
emissions scenarios (such as SSP 2-4.5) will expose ecosystems
along the Antarctic continental shelves to increasingly hazardous
conditions from surface to seafloor14. The establishment of MPAs,
especially in the Weddell Sea, could serve as a sanctuary from
acidification, given its higher sea ice coverage, which shields the
region from the most rapid warming and acidification. Additionally,
it would reduce pressure on ecosystems coming from activities such
as fishing.
Recommendations
MPAs must be accompanied by action to rapidly reduce global
emissions to the lowest possible levels to ensure the long-term
health of Antarctic marine ecosystems. ASOC therefore recommends
that ATCPs, in line with Resolution 8 (2021):
Ensure that their national delegations to the UNFCCC are aware of
severe impacts to the Southern Ocean from ocean acidification
under intermediate or high emissions scenarios unless immediate
action is taken to reduce global emissions to the very low emission
scenarios congruent with the 1.5 degree goal.
