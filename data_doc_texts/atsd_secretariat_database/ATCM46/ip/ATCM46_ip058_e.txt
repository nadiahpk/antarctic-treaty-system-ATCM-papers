Preliminary studies on microplastics from the Indian sector of the
Southern Ocean
Summary:
Acknowledging the contribution of SCAR on the subject of micro-
plastics in the Southern Ocean through its Plastic-AG and IP 78 & IP
98 submitted at XLV ATCM, the current Paper outlines a recent
Indian study documenting the existence of microplastics within the
water columns of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (ISSO).
Previously the results from the Antarctic circumnavigation
Expeditions showed no presence of microplastic in ISSO (Suaria et
al., 2020). The ongoing research into microplastics is centered on
examining biofilms covering these particles and exploring their
potential connection to the dynamics of the local food web and the
downward carbon flux in the region.
Introduction:
Ever since plastics were first observed in the Southern Ocean in
1970 (SCAR, XLV ATCM IP- 78), marine and nearshore
environments worldwide have been extensively polluted with
plastics. Human activities have been documented to play a
substantial role in the transport and spread of microplastics
throughout the oceans (Akdogan and Guven, 2019). Naik et al.
(2019) have emphasized the significance of ballast water as a
mechanism for dispersing microplastics. On average, every year,
eight million metric tons of plastics are dumped into oceans (Imran
et al., 2019). Approximately five trillion tons of plastic debris is
estimated to be floating in the oceans around the globe (Barboza et
al., 2018). The future projections are equally alarming. The United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has projected that plastic
mass in the world's oceans will exceed that of fish by the year 2050
(Rocha-Santos, 2018).
The presence of pelagic microplastics in the Southern Ocean has
also been measured (Isobe et al., 2017; Suaria et al., 2020),
indicating that even previously untouched waters of the Southern
Ocean are not immune to microplastic contamination.
Consequently, it is now widely acknowledged that microplastics
have infiltrated all marine environments, ranging from beaches to
the deep seafloor and sediments, encompassing all oceans, seas,
coastal waters and sediments worldwide. However, the extent of the
impact—whether species-specific, process-specific, or region-
specific—of this microplastic pollution in marine environments
remains largely unexplored.
Microplastic detection in the water column of ISSO:
The primary objective was to conduct an initial assessment of
microplastics within and surrounding the Polar Front in the Indian
Sector of the Southern Ocean (ISSO) during the austral summer of
2020. Samples were collected from two different stations at three
distinct depths (refer to Table 1). The average microplastic
abundance in the study area was found to be 466.67 pieces per
cubic meter. Among these, smaller microplastics (0.3-1 mm)
constituted a higher percentage (83.33%) compared to larger ones
(1 - 5 mm) which accounted for 16.67%. Smaller particles were not
detected in the uppermost layer of Station 1, while larger particles
were absent in the deepest layer of the same station. The majority
of microplastics identified in the samples were in the form of
fragments (90.48%), followed by fibers (7.14%) and films (2.38%).
Foams and pellets were not observed in any of the water samples.
Analysis of the polymer composition indicated a predominance of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the microplastics collected from
the study area, constituting 88.10%.

Conclusion:
This study indicates the presence of microplastics from the Indian
sector of the Southern Ocean. Microplastics have a notable ability to
act as carriers of chemical pollutants in marine ecosystems by
absorbing pollutants onto their surfaces (Mato et al., 2001; Teuten
et al., 2009), and subsequently being ingested by organisms as
small as zooplankton (Desforges et al., 2015), alongside the
documented ingestion of microplastics by krill (Dawson et al et al.),
it is evident that the detection of microplastics in the region
signifies a critical issue with far-reaching implications.
