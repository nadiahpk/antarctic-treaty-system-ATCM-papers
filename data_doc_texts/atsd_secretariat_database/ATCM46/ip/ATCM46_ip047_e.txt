Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in
Ushuaia during the 2023/2024 Austral summer season
Information Paper submitted by Argentina
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and
vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2023/2024 Austral
summer season, operating through the port of Ushuaia. The number
of voyages, passengers and their nationalities, average number of
crew per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships, are
included as well.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South
America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of
Antarctic ship-borne tourism since the mid-1990´s, concentrating
approximately 90% of the worldwide ship-borne Antarctic tourist
activity.
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has
contributed to facilitate Antarctic cruise ships operations through
the port of Ushuaia. In addition to the short distance between
Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, said infrastructure allowed
tour operators to extend the frequency of their Antarctic operations
during the tourist season.
Regarding Antarctic ship-borne tourism that operates through the
port of Ushuaia, we can make a clear distinction between different
types of vessels, according to their activities in the Antarctic
Peninsula area. On the one hand, vessels that make landings at
different locations; and, on the other hand, vessels of a much larger
size which only sail Antarctic waters without enabling landings.
Moreover, a further distinction can be made when looking into the
services the vessels require from the port of Ushuaia: those vessels
that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American
and Antarctic itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia’s port as
their summer base of operations. Generally, in the latter case,
operations carried out in Ushuaia involve passenger changeover,
using the city’s airport, port and maritime services, as well as the
general supply of provisions and tourist services. Finally, it should
be noted that at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic
tourist season, several vessels arrive to and/or depart from the port
of Ushuaia, and engage in positioning voyages from or towards
other destinations.
In order to present the status of tourist flows of visitors and vessels
that, through Ushuaia’s port, visited Antarctica in the 2023/2024
season, data was collected from the ship’s dispatches It refers to the
inbound and outbound clearance documentation provided by the
master of the vessel. provided to Prefectura Naval Argentina
(Argentine Coast Guard), national competent authority to that
effect, together with documents in custody at the Dirección
Provincial de Puertos (Provincial Port Authority) in Ushuaia. In
some cases, this information was compared to the itineraries
provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained
from alternative sources. Such information was used to prepare a
database for each Antarctic tourist season.
This document updates the data provided in similar papers
presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meetings since 2009, giving information that may contribute to
discussions related to Antarctic tourism.
Brief review of Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that operated
through Ushuaia during the 2022/2023 Austral summer season
The 2023/2024 tourist season started on October 19th when the
vessel Ocean Albatros (Albatros Expeditions) set sail for Antarctica,
and finished on April 5th with the arrival of the vessel Sylvia Earle
(Aurora Expeditions) to the port of Ushuaia. There was a total of
447 voyages run by 55 vessels, including the SV Bark Europa.
December was the busiest month regarding the number of Antarctic
voyages (26.40%), followed by January (23.71%) (See Figure 1).

During the 2023/2024 season, 111,497 visitors went to Antarctica,
using Ushuaia as a connection port from and/or to the Antarctic
territory. Three passenger categories can be identified: a) those that
departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that
either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is, passengers who
went through Ushuaia only once, either on arrival or departure to
Antarctica- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way
to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports
(See Table 1). In the first case (a), only the departure of the vessels
was considered in order to count the passengers. In the second case
(b), both the passengers who arrived at, and the ones who departed
from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account, because several
vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, either
combining with other means of transport such as flight-cruise, or
visited Antarctica as part of the beginning and/or end of season
voyage, operating locally (in Ushuaia) during the rest of the season.
Finally, the last case (c) refers to vessels in transit, with passengers
that were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the case
when calling in at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. In this
regard, a distinction was made, according to the provisions of
Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting, between vessels that transported 500
passengers or less, and those that transported more than 500
passengers. Therefore, 8 vessels carried more than 500 passengers
completing 21 trips in total and transporting 40,340 passengers,
representing 36.18% of the passengers that visited Antarctica.
The average number of crew members and passengers The average
number of passengers on board is taken into account -not the
capacity of the vessel, because in some cases it could be that vessels
transport a smaller number of passengers than their total capacity.,
as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in Table
2. Figure 2 shows passenger averages per vessel.

Among the vessels in transit via Ushuaia, those that sailed through
Antarctic waters without disembarking in Antarctica are
noteworthy. As previously stated, these cruise ships completed
itineraries around the southern parts of South America, or were
involved in more extensive voyages and, on certain itineraries, they
included navigating in waters close to the Antarctic Peninsula. Most
of these vessels run “pendular” trips along Beagle Channel to
connect ports located on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and visit
Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3
provides an overview of the vessels that transported more than 500
passengers per trip, highlighting whether the visit to Antarctica was
before or after the port call in Ushuaia.
It is worth noting that the vessels Greg Mortimer, Magellan
Explorer, Ocean Adventurer, Ocean Nova, Sylvia Earle, World
Explorer and World Voyager, operated differently than the rest of
the vessels in some voyages, as they did so directly from Isla 25 de
Mayo (King George Island), South Shetland Islands, embarking
passengers that flew in and out from Punta Arenas (Chile). Voyages
that started and/or ended in Ushuaia were considered in the count
when carrying passengers, but those that operated only with crew
and staff were not.
Besides, other vessels such as the National Geographic Endurance
and Le Commandant Charcot made semi circumnavigation voyages
of the Antarctic continent between Ushuaia and Dunedin/Lyttelton
(New Zealand) in both directions according to the ship destination.
The Hanseatic Spirit made one semi circumnavigation voyage from
Ushuaia to Lyttelton.

Furthermore, 36 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica
operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account
for 65,45% of the total number of vessels that were counted. Each
of these vessels made between 7 and 15 voyages to Antarctica, as
indicated in Figure 3.
Regarding visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of
Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers who made landings were
registered. In this regard, more than 100 nationalities were
identified, with most of the passengers being from the United
States, followed by China, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada,
Germany, Argentina, Brazil, France, Netherlands, Mexico,
Switzerland, Russian Federation, New Zealand, among others.
Percentages of the main nationalities are represented in Figure 4,
where a total of 20 nationalities account for 93.41% of all visitors.

According to Measure 15 (2009), adopted at the XXXII Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one
guide every 20 passengers, we identified expedition staff members
included on the crew and/or on the passenger lists. Keeping a direct
relationship with passengers, expedition staff members perform
different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and
lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the
landing activities. The only trips considered here were the ones
made by vessels that carry 500 passengers or less. In most voyages,
expedition staff is included in the crew manifest (See Table 4). It is
worth mentioning that the expedition staff position is stated only
when they are so listed on the crew manifest.
According to the registration of the vessels that operated in
Antarctica throughout this season from Ushuaia, we observed that
among the Flag States of those vessels, four (4) are Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Parties (France, Netherlands, Norway and United
Kingdom) and one (1) is a Non-Consultative Party (Portugal). On
the other hand, seven vessels (7) are not registered to a Party to the
Antarctic Treaty (Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Malta,
Panama and Togo) (See Figure 5).

Concluding remarks
From the gathered data, it has been possible to prepare statistic
information allowing for the identification of the vessels that
operated in Antarctica using the port of Ushuaia, during the
2023/2024 season, the number of trips made, the number of
passengers and their nationalities, the average of crew members per
vessel, the expedition staff and the countries where the ships are
registered.
This season shows an increase in the number of vessels, voyages
and number of passengers compared to the previous season. The
total number of passengers who visited Antarctica through the port
of Ushuaia increased by 15,81% compared to the past season while
voyages rose by 7,37%.
The number of voyages made by large vessels that only navigated
Antarctic waters remained at 21. Ten vessels operated under this
modality and carried a total of 40,340 passengers, representing a
growth of 17% compared to season 2022/2023.
The data herein presented aims to contribute, as an alternative and
complementary source, in the assessment of tourism in the
Antarctic Peninsula region, with special emphasis on those tourist
vessels that call in at the port of Ushuaia.
