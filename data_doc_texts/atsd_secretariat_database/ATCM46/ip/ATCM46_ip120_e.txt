Vulnerability of polar heritage remains in context of climate change
- experiences and research from Norway
Summary
Climate change strongly impacts vulnerable heritage sites. Lessons
learned from the polar situations in the north, can give valuable
insight into similar challenges in the Antarctic. The document is
intended to inform the Committee’s discussions on climate change
impacts on Antarctic heritage, in particular in relation to the
ongoing efforts to develop climate change assessment tool for
Antarctic heritage values.
Norwegian researchers, management authorities and institutions
have experience with climate change and its effects on heritage
remains in polar areas. This information paper gives an overview of
such knowledge based on current scientific work and management
experiences available from literature, mainly from the High Arctic.
We present studies and cases about effects of climate change on
heritage remains, focusing on environmental threats that are
relevant to conservation and management of such remains in the
Antarctic region.
Background
At CEP XXIV New Zealand, Argentina, Norway and the United
Kingdom presented WP 26 Assessing the risk of climate change
impacts on Antarctic heritage values. The Committee expressed full
support for the proposed work. At CEP XXV the same members
presented IP 102 Assessing the risk of climate change impacts on
Antarctic heritage values: an update on progress. That information
paper also included a summary of resources identified in a review
of relevant previous work related to this topic. This present
document presents some of the Norwegian contributions to this list
of resources.
Climate change impacts and cultural heritage vulnerability
The polar climate in the Norwegian high Arctic, is characterized by
low average temperatures, permafrost and limited precipitation.
Impacts from climate change are already observed, and is expected
to cause further increased annual temperatures, increased annual
precipitation, and heated permafrost and thawing in coastal and
low-lying areas (Hanssen-Bauer et al., 2019). Similar climatic
changes are observed and anticipated in other parts of the Arctic, as
well as the Antarctic region (Chown et al., 2022), and pose
significant threats to preservation of vulnerable heritage sites in
polar areas. Since most polar heritage values are close to the sea,
climatic effects pronounced in coastal areas pose the greatest
threats.
A systematic review of publications about climate change impacts
on heritage remains and climate change adaptation in the Arctic
and Antarctica, identifies coastal erosion, biological degradation,
debris flow and thaw slumps as the main hazards (Nicu & Fatorić,
2023). The review identified the major climate change risks to
heritage values in Antarctica to be increased coastal erosion rates
and wind action, and fungi and algae growth that can damage
construction materials. Based on knowledge and experiences from
Norwegian institutions/projects and the literature presented in this
information paper, effects from coastal processes and erosion
(Antonello, 2022; Boro et al., 2020; Granberg et al., 2020; Martens
& Krangnes, 2022; Nicu et al., 2020, Nicu et al., 2021), melting
permafrost (Boro et al., 2020; Enevoldsen, 2022; Flyen & Mattsson,
2017; Granberg et al., 2020;) and fungal decay (Flyen & Mattsson,
2017; Flyen et al., 2020; Flyen & Mattsson, 2013; Flyen & Mattsson,
2018; Flyen & Thuestad, 2023; Granberg et al., 2020; Mattsson et
al., 2010; Mattsson & Flyen, 2010) are particularly pertinent
environmental threats to Arctic heritage environments.
Coastal erosion is linked to climate change through sea ice and
permafrost decline. Reduction in sea ice and permafrost makes the
coast more exposed and less stable, and thus more prone to erosion
(as described in e.g. Granberg et al., 2020). Several cases from the
Norwegian High Arctic, exemplifies how coastal erosion poses
direct threats to heritage environment (Antonello, 2022; Boro et al.,
2020; Nicu et al., 2020; Nicu et al., 2021).
In Hiorthhamn, an abandoned coal mining settlement close to
Longyearbyen, coastal erosion rates have been calculated and
documented for the period 1927-2020 (Nicu et al., 2020; Nicu et
al., 2021). High shoreline erosion rates in a section with several
heritage objects, gives high potential for damage of the protected
remains. The findings support the urgent need for coastal
monitoring and management efforts if heritage values are to be
maintained at this site. Another study from the same site,
demonstrates how future recession of the coastline can increase
significantly compared to expectations from the initial studies,
given future intensification of storm events (Antonello, 2022). The
study emphasizes how the future of an Arctic shoreline highly
depends on future climatic scenarios.
Another case, from the hunting station “Fredheim” in Sassenfjorden,
gives an example of active protection measures to protect heritage
remains from coastal erosion (Boro et al., 2020). In 2001 a small
cabin was moved further away from the coast due to the increasing
threat from coastal erosion. The old site of the relocated hut is
today lost to erosion – an unusual measure possible due to
management priorities, resources, thorough planning and skilled
execution.
Biological deterioration of wood and other materials occurs
naturally over time, and fungal decay is one of the main reasons
(Granberg et al., 2020). Growing conditions for fungal decay are
limited by temperature and moisture, thus, for a long time, the
climatic conditions were expected to be too harsh for rot fungus to
thrive (Mattsson et al., 2010). However, microclimatic conditions
have proven to be considerably favourable for substantial rot
damage in wooden structures (e.g. Mattsson et al., 2010; Mattsson
& Flyen, 2010; Flyen et al., 2020). Examinations of more than 100
protected buildings and remains , found brown rot fungi to cause
most wood decay (Mattsson & Flyen, 2010; Mattsson et al., 2010).
This is in contrast to findings from wooden heritage in Antarctica
(Mattsson et al., 2010), where species of soft rot fungi are the
dominating concerns for biodeterioration of wooden structures
(reviewed by Flyen & Thuestad, 2023).
The growing risk of fungal decay in polar wooden heritage is for
example demonstrated by Flyen et al. (2020). With compiled
measurements from four different projects (2009-2019), one of the
main conclusions was that microclimatic rather than macroclimatic
conditions predict fungal growth and decay. The effects of a
changing climate with increased temperatures and humidity, expect
to improve overall conditions for fungal decay and increase the risk
of e.g. rot fungus in wooden heritage objects (Flyen & Thuestad,
2023; Granberg et al., 2020). Melting permafrost where wooden
fundament structures are embedded, exposes the materials to
moisture and direct soil contact, further enhancing microclimatic
growth conditions (Flyen & Mattsson, 2017) as well as decreases
stability of structures embedded in the permafrost (Enevoldsen,
2022).
Multiple environmental hazards can impact heritage and historic
remains, and thus cause combined, cumulative effects. In addition,
impacts from increased human activity in the polar regions is
another pressure on heritage values in these areas that need to be
addressed in the context of a rapidly changing environment
(Barlindhaug et al., 2017; Holmgaard et al., 2019; Martens &
Krangnes, 2022; Thuestad et al., 2015).
Management and adaptation measures
Despite the well-known impacts from climate change on immovable
heritage remains globally, there is limited research on climate
change impacts and climate change adaptation in the polar regions
(Nicu & Fatoric, 2023). Some studies have addressed the issue of
wooden structures founded in permafrost that are threatened by
increased soil-contact and development of wood-decay fungi, and
have explored and suggested measures to detect, prevent and/or
repair damage
to wooden heritage (Enevoldsen, 2022; Flyen & Mattsson, 2010,
2017, 2018). Initial inspections of cableway posts close to
Longyearbyen showed a great variation of fungal decay, and that
damages are difficult to detect without thorough inspection (Flyen
& Mattsson, 2013). Insulation measures in the ground close to
wooden foundation, showed to further improve growing conditions
for wood-decay fungus and lead to increased decomposition of
wooden materials (Flyen & Mattsson, 2017). Flyen & Mattsson
(2018) summarized how to examine and assess cableway posts and
carry out necessary repairs, with conservation assessments and
current methods for investigation and repair for the most prominent
damage problems. On similar subjects, Enevoldsen (2022)
investigated how to rehabilitate cableway post foundations to
preserve the damaged heritage, and proposed pile foundations as a
functional solution against future anticipated shifts in active layer
thickness and permafrost temperatures.
The Adapt Northern Heritage project developed conservation
factsheets as part of a tool to assess risks and plan adaptation for
management of northern historic places affected by climate change
(Granberg et al., 2020). The six factsheets explores and present how
climate change affects conservation practices regarding fungal
decay, coastal processes, flooding, frost and salt deterioration,
landslides and snow load and avalanches.
Some projects and studies from the Norwegian High Arctic have
aimed to monitor heritage environments to increase the knowledge
base for decision-making and management (Barlindhaug et al.,
2017; Martens & Krangnes, 2022; Mattsson & Flyen, 2010; Thuestad
et al., 2015). The CULTCOAST research project installed
environmental monitoring equipment to monitor the ongoing
changes and their possible impacts on preservation of heritage sites.
The early results seemed to provide sufficient information to
evaluate site preservation conditions (Martens & Krangnes, 2022).
Other studies have focused on remote sensing techniques to monitor
environmental changes on heritage sites, such as vegetation
damage, to assess impact of increased tourism and traffic on
heritage environments (Barlindhaug et al., 2017; Holmgaard et al.,
2019; Thuestad et al., 2015). Holmgaard et al. (2019) found
vegetation monitoring to be useful in management for establishing
the level for acceptable impact and sustainable tourism.
