Monitoring and detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(HPAI) in the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula
Monitoring and detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(HPAI) in the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula
Summary
The purpose of this report is to present the monitoring that the
Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) has carried out in the South
Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula for the detection of
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
Background
The current HPAI H5N1 outbreak, which began in 2022, has led to
the deaths of large numbers of sea birds in the Northern
Hemisphere, southern Africa, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and
throughout South America.
Monitoring efforts by Chile's National Antarctic Science Programme
(PROCIEN) began in the South Shetland Islands from January 2023
and have been extended until March 2024, focusing on areas where
penguins, flying birds and sea mammals gather. This is due to the
fact that the reports of positive cases in Patagonia and the Sub-
Antarctic Islands indicated a possible arrival on the Antarctic
Peninsula.
Following the guidelines of the Antarctic Treaty and the SCAR
wildlife expert group, observations and sample collection were
carried out during the austral summer of 2023 and early 2020, with
no positive cases being detected. Samples from dead skuas on James
Ross Island were positive, confirming the presence of HPAI H5N1
gene clade 2.3.4.4. These findings not only contribute to confirming
the presence of the virus in Antarctica during the specified period,
but also emphasise the need for sustained surveillance and
monitoring to safeguard the Antarctic ecosystem.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5 (H5N1) has
caused outbreaks in wild birds in the Northern Hemisphere since
2021. These have been accentuated in 2022, adding several species
of mammals. The virus spread rapidly in North and South America,
with a large number of outbreaks in 2022 and 20231.
Taking into consideration the recommendations of the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the Antarctic Wildlife
Health Network (AWHN) and our experts, an active surveillance
initiative was undertaken in the South Shetland Islands in January
2023, part of the Chilean Antarctic Institute with the specific
objective of determining the presence of avian influenza, and
specifically the H5N1 subtype of the highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus. The research covered a variety of locations,
including Hanna Point (Livingston Island), Lions Rump (King
George Island) and Fildes Peninsula (King
George Island), with specific observations of marine mammals
(southern elephant seals), flying birds (kelp gulls, the snowy
sheathbill and the brown skua) and penguins (the chinstrap penguin
and the gentoo penguin), confirming the absence of the virus.
Subsequently, in January 2024, the Chilean Antarctic Institute
continued with the surveillance programme and molecular analysis
laboratories at Escudero Base (King Jorge Island) and O'Higgins
Base (Antarctic Peninsula).
The study included examining these sites for signs of mass mortality
events possibly attributable to HPAI H5N1, as well as sampling for
influenza detection using real-time RT-PCR. A considerable
sampling effort was carried out from December 2023 to January
2024 with a total of 815 samples analysed for the Fildes Peninsula,
all of which were negative. However, in the sampling carried out on
James Ross Island in the vicinity of Mendel Base, all skua samples
were confirmed positive for HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4 by real-time
RT-PCR. These results confirmed the second mortality event
recorded in Antarctica (south of 60°S) caused by HPAI H5N1, in this
case in skuas.
Conclusions
Taking into account the above, we conclude the need for a greater
number of studies to genetically characterise the virus and better
understand the role of skuas in the dynamics of viral dissemination
in Antarctica.
