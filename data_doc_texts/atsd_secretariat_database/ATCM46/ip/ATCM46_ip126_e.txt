Joint Efforts in the Rapid Detection of Avian Influenza Virus in
Antarctic Wildlife on King George Island, South Shetland Islands
Summary
Recent global outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) and its potential impact on Antarctic wildlife call for
proactive monitoring and rapid diagnosis. During the 2023/2024
austral summer, the National Antarctic Programs collaborated to
monitor the avian influenza virus (AIV) using a rapid diagnosis tool
on King George Island. No positive cases of AIV were detected in
the surveyed areas of the Island. The proponents suggest that
Parties collaborate to enhance preparedness for the next season.
Introduction
Since 2022, thousands of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
outbreaks have been recorded worldwide, and these outbreaks of
HPAI (H5N1) have heightened concern for wildlife conservation.
Avian influenza virus (AIV) affects birds and mammals, transmitted
through faeces, contaminated water and soil, direct contact, and
respiratory droplets. Significant mortality in sea lions, attributed to
HPAI, was reported in Peru (Gamarra-Toledo et al. 2023) and
outbreaks of HPAI (H5N1) in non-poultry animals have been
detected in Chile and Ecuador (WOAH 2023). The recent outbreaks
in South American countries indicate a high risk of the virus being
introduced to the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions. At the ATCM
XLV in Helsinki, Parties shared their experiences and urged
National Antarctic Programs to develop and implement procedures
to prevent the introduction and spread of HPAI (ATCM XLV WP 03,
IP 39). The Republic of Korea proposed the rapid detection of AIV
using rapid test kits and a collaborative effort among the Parties
(ATCMXLV-IP 23 rev.1). Early detection of HPAI in wildlife is
crucial to prevent the spread of the virus and reduce its impact on
the Antarctic wildlife populations. The Committee for
Environmental Protection welcomed these contributions noting
their usefulness in fostering future collaboration between competent
authorities and promoting preventive procedures measures among
national programs and other stakeholders (ATCM XLV Final
Report).
During the 2023/2024 austral summer, the National Antarctic
Programs of Chile, the Republic of Korea, and Uruguay, with
support from the Russian Federation, collaborated to monitor the
AIV in penguins, other seabirds and seals on King George Island.
Outcomes of Avian Influenza Virus Rapid Detection in 2023/2024
During the 2023/2024 austral summer season, experts from
national programs conducted rapid diagnostics for avian influenza
virus (AIV) using faeces from three species of penguins, five species
of seabirds and Weddell Seals. These animals inhabit the vicinity of
research bases and their colonies on Barton Peninsula and Fildes
Peninsula including Ardley Island in King George Island, South
Shetland Islands. For rapid detection, the commercial diagnostic kit,
the VDRG® AIV Ag Rapid kit 2.0 (Median Diagnostics, Republic of
Korea) was utilized. This kit’s diagnostic device can detect AIV
antigens within 15 minutes after sample injection and is applicable
for most virus subtypes, including high and low pathogenic avian
influenza. Notably, since low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)
viruses have been continuously detected in Antarctic wildlife (Hurt
2014, Barriga 2016, de Seixas 2022), and one LPAI strain is known
to significantly contribute to the evolution of highly virulent H5N1
subtype (Naddaf 2023), the use of this kit should also include the
detection of LPAI viruses.
Encouragingly, the survey results revealed no positive cases of AIV
detected within the monitored areas of King George Island (Table
1).

Future plans and further collaboration
Recent HPAI outbreaks caused by H5N1 virus have become
persistent and been spreading pole to pole. Notably, HPAI was
confirmed for the first time in Antarctic Peninsula region in
February 2024, as reported by the COMNAP HPAI update. This
event underscores the critical importance of preparedness for the
upcoming 2024/2025 Antarctic season.
Early detection of HPAI in wildlife is pivotal in preventing the
virus’s spread, mitigating its impact on the Antarctic wildlife
populations, and safeguarding the health of ecologically related
animals and humans potentially exposed to infected animals.
Furthermore, monitoring of LPAI viruses is also essential due to the
possible emergence of mutant viruses through interactions with
LPAI viruses (Naddaf 2023).
In light of these challenges, the proponents advocate for enhanced
collaboration in the 2024/2025 Antarctic season. We propose a
collaborative effort other Parties and members of the Committee
operating their National Antarctic Programs at this region. Korea
Polar Research Institute plans to distribute rapid detection kits via
King Sejong Station, aiming for distribution before the start of the
austral summer season, ideally by October of this year.
