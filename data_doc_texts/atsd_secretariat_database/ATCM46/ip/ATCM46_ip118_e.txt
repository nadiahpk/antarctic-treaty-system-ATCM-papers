Initial Environmental Evaluation for the Exploration of Subglacial
Lake Qilin (Snow Eagle) in Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by China
Summary
Polar Research Institute of China is planning to conduct the
Exploration of Subglacial Lake Qilin (Snow Eagle) in the near
future, with the aim to facilitate the understanding of the lives in
extreme environments under the ice sheet and the history of the
East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is crucial for assessing the stability
of the Antarctic ice sheet and subsequent sea level rise. After going
through a rigorous EIA process, it is concluded that the exploration
will have minimal or temporary impact on the Antarctic
environment, and the scientific significance and knowledge to be
gained from the exploration on a global scale outweigh any
potential adverse effects that may arise from the proposed program.
Background
Resolution 4 (2017) Green Expedition in the Antarctic encouraged
National Antarctic Programs to conduct science in an environment-
friendly manner in the Antarctic, and produce high-quality
Environmental Impact Assessments when new activities are planned
that include as far as possible best practices to prevent and
minimise environmental impact. In the sprite of protecting the
Antarctic environment and following the recommendation of the
Resolution 4 (2017), China has organized rigorous environmental
impact evaluation for the exploration of Lake Qilin and developed
an IEE report in accordance with the Protocol as shown in the
attachment.
Conclusion
The proposed exploration of Lake Qilin is expected to yield
significant findings regarding life in extreme environments and the
history of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Understanding the latter is
crucial for assessing the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and
subsequent sea level rise. Therefore, the scientific research
conducted holds genuine interest for policy makers, the scientific
community, as well as the general public and media.
Since 2016, this program has been in the planning and design stage,
with a strong emphasis on environmental protection. Extensive data
has been collected near this lake to establish baseline conditions for
the IEE, and robust measures have been incorporated to mitigate
potential negative impacts.
The proposed exploration program will involve 7-8 weeks field
season, including transportation within inland Antarctica. During
this period, a team of 15 members will establish a drill camp and
utilize a hot water drill to penetrate the upper 3400 m of the ice
layer. This drilling process is estimated to take approximately 4
days, resulting in a main borehole diameter exceeding 300 mm.
Subsequently, the RECAS will be employed to penetrate the
remaining 200 m of the ice layer within about 5 days, ultimately
reaching the subglacial lake. It is noted that the total depth of the
overlying ice layer above the subglacial lake is approximately 3600
m. During RECAS drilling, one side experiences heat-induced
melting while simultaneously undergoing freezing. Once the RECAS
has successfully reached the subglacial lake, an onboard probe will
be deployed to measure and collect approximately 500 ml of water.
Finally, the RECAS will facilitate the re-melting of the lowermost
200 m ice layer and ascend to the surface through the hot water
main borehole.
The IEE includes a thorough assessment of potential environmental
impacts. The primary concern is the potential contamination of the
lake and its subsequent impact on microbial function. Currently, the
microbial populations in the lake are unknown and can only be
determined through the exploration. To mitigate this impact, the
hot water drilling methodology together with a state-of-art drill
RECAS will be employed, using filtered ice water heated to 90 Â°C
and treated with UV radiation, along with rigorous microbial
control contamination methods. In particular, the RECAS drilling
approach will prevent the hot water entering the lake, achieving
contamination-free lake water sampling.
Considering the comprehensive potential environmental impacts
and the implementation of stringent preventative and mitigation
measures, China believes that exploration of Lake Qilin will have
minimal or temporary impact on the Antarctic environment. In
particular, the utilization of RECAS in the proposed project sets it
apart from all previous Antarctic subglacial lake explorations, as it
serves as an ideal solution for preventing contamination of
subglacial lake. Thus, China has opted to undertake the IEE.
China has reached the conclusion that the scientific significance and
knowledge to be gained from the exploration of Lake Qilin on a
global scale outweigh any potential adverse effects that may arise
from the proposed program. This justification supports the decision
to proceed with the activity.
