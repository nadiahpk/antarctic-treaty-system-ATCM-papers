Scientific research supporting the development of a comprehensive
and consistent framework for Antarctic tourism management
Scientific research supporting the development of a comprehensive
and consistent framework for Antarctic tourism management
Summary
The strong rebound of Antarctic tourism post-pandemic invigorates
the discourse about expanding tourism footprints and their
ramifications (ATCM, 2019). The March 2023 informal workshop
on Antarctic tourism (Paris) (convened by France and The
Netherlands) and ATCM XLV identified five thematic building
blocks for developing a comprehensive and consistent framework
for Antarctic tourism (ATCM 2023a and 2023b), and ATCM XLV
Decision 6 established a dedicated process for the framework
development (ATCM 2023c). While there is a long history of
Antarctic tourism scholarship dating back to the 1980s, this IP aims
to compile relevant scientific publications suggested by SCAR
Tourism Action Group members, some of whom are also members
of IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas. These publications
are organised by the five cross-cutting building blocks (growth;
diversification; monitoring; compliance/enforcement; and overall
governance) to help inform the process of framework development.
It is important to note that neither SCAR nor IUCN endorses any
viewpoints, recommendations, or conclusions of the listed
publications. Instead, the intention is to invite policy makers to take
note of a significant body of scholarly research that already exists to
inform actions and decisions in light of ATS values and principles,
utilizing the best available science.
Building block 1: Managing growth
Description/Key Issues
Growth relates to the total number of visitors, as well as to the
increase in the length of the season, the number of sites visited, the
geographic location of these visited sites, the number of ships and
aircraft used, and the number of voyages and flights per season. The
complexities of growth concerning the emergence of new
modalities, the use, and management of visited sites (i.e., booking
vs. actual use, organisation of multiple activities at one site), and
the challenges that an increasing tourist fleet pose to the
conservation of Antarctic values.
Assessment of Literature
The literature referenced below provides a historical perspective
and important insights about the growth of Antarctic tourism, in
terms of numbers of passengers and vessels, routes, itineraries, and
other dimensions. Papers have examined viewpoints and concerns
about the tourism growth from different stakeholders have been.
Many studies relevant to this and other building blocks utilize the
tourist numbers and activity details reported annually by IAATO to
ATCM.

While dated, this article summarises the evolution of Antarctic
tourism and offers useful comparisons with the tourism numbers
reached today.
Building block 2: Managing diversification
Description/Key Issues
Diversification relates to, for example, the increase in the types of
itineraries and activities conducted, as well as the types of
transportation modes (or modalities) and the types of operators
offering tourism products. Some notable emerging issues include
the rapid growth of air-cruise modality, appeal of novel itineraries
and adventures (e.g., scuba diving, marathon running) to more
diverse tourist profiles (e.g., younger tourists), and increasing
incorporation of citizen science activities.
Assessment of Literature
This body of literature presents the issue of diversification of
Antarctic/polar tourism in terms of activities and impacts. Social
science research shows the diversification of motivations,
experiences, and memories among Antarctic tourists. Diversification
issues are gaining increasing research attention, contributing to our
understanding of the implications of diversification on site
management, activities, and cumulative impacts.

https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2023.2272224
Antarctic tourism is increasing and diversifying leading to different
types of experiences and memories. This research emphasises how
different recollections of memories could impact the tourist
experience and underscores the need to transition from snapshot to
transformative memories if the aim is to create awareness for
Antarctica.

This paper presents a characterization of the diversification of
tourists’ motivations and their relationship with pro-environmental
outcomes. It discusses how different motivations could influence the
tourist experience - in terms of learning- as well as modalities and
activities.
Building block 3: Monitoring
Description/Key Issues
Environmental monitoring has long been identified as key to better
assessing possible changes and identifying impacts of tourism.
Monitoring is also an obligation under the Protocol on
Environmental Protection. Technological advancements have the
potential to support development of further long-term
environmental and climate monitoring, and may facilitate near real-
time environmental prediction, ocean, ice, climate and weather
services that can be used to support efficiency, activity safety,
incident prevention and environmental impacts of tourism
operations. Social and experiential monitoring relate to an
understanding of temporal changes in tourism, such as markets,
operations, and programming, as well as pro-environmental
outcomes of Antarctic tourist experience.
Assessment of Literature
The publications listed below provide insights into the pressing
concerns of the science community about Antarctic environmental
conservation relative to human activities in the southern polar
region, and the need to strengthen monitoring among actors.
Monitoring studies utilizing experimental approaches have been
conducted to identify the impacts of human presence and/or assess
the effectiveness of different management strategies.

summarises historical to current human-generated impacts in
Antarctica’s marine environment. Authors conclude that interacting
combinations of anthropogenic disturbances and stresses on local,
regional and global scales are driving the trajectories of degradation
of marine ecosystems in Antarctica.
Building block 4: Compliance and enforcement
Description/Key Issues
Given the complexity and specificity of the governance of
Antarctica, compliance and enforcement require specific and
detailed attention, to better monitor and ensure the effective
enforcement of existing and future regulations.
Assessment of Literature
The literature compiled here is relevant to the development of
regulatory systems and mechanisms of compliance and enforcement
of present and future regulations pertaining to commercial activities
in Antarctica. These scholarly works provide arguments for the
adoption of regulatory tools used elsewhere in international
environmental governance systems. This list provides a robust
starting point for the building block of compliance and
enforcement.

This article discusses at length Antarctica’s global regulations for
shipping, including specially targeted provisions under MARPOL,
SOLAS, Polar Code, and the measures under the Antarctic Treaty
System. However, the author points out the lack of tailor-made
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with these regulations. In
addition, it suggests three different proposals for mechanisms that
may serve to ensure compliance with the global and Antarctic
regulations.

Although this paper addresses issues with control on commercial
fishing vessels in polar waters, its discussion on the role of Port
State Control and the needed cooperation among different polar
organisations in inspection procedures is worth the attention and
applicable to Antarctic tourism.

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39914-0_3
The authors of this paper discuss the current regulatory framework
for supervision of shipborne Antarctic tourism, including the
industry’s self-regulation. The lack of effective enforcement
capabilities in Antarctica and the dynamic nature of the tourism
industry, along with the effectiveness of Flag State regime and
applicability for Port State Control in the Antarctic context are
argued here.

This research supports the requirement for Port State controls on
Antarctic-bound tourist ships at the gateway states. It confirms the
need for standard regulations implemented across all gateway
states, which currently show discrepancies on policy, capacity and
implementation of Port State controls.

This paper discusses the international legitimacy of the governance
of Antarctica under the ATS in the context of managing Antarctic
tourism, particularly when there is a strong reliance on the tourism
industry’s self-regulation system for controls and monitoring. It
presents a novel approach to address the regulation of Antarctic
tourism under the premises behind the acronym IUU (illegal,
unreported and unregulated).

Vidas’ book is considered seminal work on early Antarctic
environmental protection scholarship.
Vicuña’s chapter discusses the negotiations that followed the
signing of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, particularly in matters of
Inspections and Control, and the compromise that claimant and
non-claimant countries arrived at when proposing the jurisdictional
approach over the principle of nationality.
Building block 5: Overall governance
Description/Key Issues
Governance measures in relation to the above four building blocks
may jointly establish a comprehensive and consistent framework for
the governance of tourism and other non-governmental activities,
which may also entail some overarching approaches or components.
Key issues include the role of continued industry cooperation, the
difficulties that come with monitoring this remote region, and a
plan for the rapidly growing visitation to the region.
Assessment of Literature
The literature listed below considers Antarctic tourism from a
holistic perspective. These publications speak to the overall
management of Antarctic tourism, as well as to the role of the
Antarctic Treaty System in the governance of tourism in the region.
The literature highlights that while tourism development has been
discussed extensively by the ATCM, many policy questions and
concerns remain outstanding.

Parties to the Antarctic Treaty (ATCPs) and the need to safeguard
the international legitimacy of the ATS, as well as examining
avenues for further international regulation by the ATCPs.
Concluding Remarks
As ATCM Observer and Invited Expert, respectively, SCAR and
IUCN can offer their tourism research expertise in support of ATCM
discussions (ATCM 2022; IUCN 2023). The above compilation of
selected scientific publications offers an annotated overview of
research directly relevant to the five building blocks for the
Antarctic tourism management framework being discussed by the
ATCM. It is not intended to be an exhaustive collection of scholarly
work on tourism issues. For more integrative reviews, refer to
literature syntheses such as Stewart et al. (2017) and Demiroglu et
al. (2020). It is important to note that neither SCAR nor IUCN
endorse any viewpoints, recommendations, or conclusions of the
listed publications. Instead, the intention is to invite policy makers
to take note of a significant body of scholarly research that already
exists to inform actions and decisions in light of ATS values and
principles, utilizing the best available science. This IP is intended to
inform the Antarctic Treaty Parties about collaborative work being
undertaken by SCAR and the IUCN. It will also stimulate
engagement of the scientific community within SCAR (e.g., Ant-
TAG) and IUCN (e.g., WCPA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist
Group) in contributing their expertise to inform further discussions
on the development of an Antarctic tourism framework.
