Public Calls for PROANTAR Research Projects 2022/2023
Public Calls for PROANTAR Research Projects 2022/2023
Abstract
This document presents the public calls for research project
contracting launched by the Brazilian Antarctic Program
(PROANTAR) in 2022 and 2023, through the National Council for
Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Ministry
of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MCTI).
Introduction
In 2022, the CNPq/MCTI-FNDCT Call No. 61/2022 was launched -
"Citizen Science and Scientific Dissemination: Science at Sea
Program, Antarctic Science, and National Actions focused on the
United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable
Development." The objective of this Call is to support citizen science
and dissemination projects for scientific, technological, and
innovation research, aiming to significantly contribute to the
development and improvement of the Science at Sea and Antarctic
Science Programs of MCTI, and national actions for the United
Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The
final selection resulted in the approval of 11 projects, with 6
projects in the scientific dissemination line (2 of them focusing on
Antarctic Science), and 5 projects in the citizen science line. A total
of R$ 6,000,000 (six million reais; approximately US$1,204,200)
was allocated for this action.
In 2023, the CNPq/MCTI/FNDCT Call No. 08/2023 was launched -
"Support for Research, Development, and Innovation related to
Antarctica - PROANTAR." The objective of this call is to support
multidisciplinary and multi-institutional scientific, technological,
and innovation research projects, with international cooperation
incentives, within the scope of PROANTAR, aimed at significantly
contributing to high-quality Brazilian scientific production,
generating scientific, technological, and innovative knowledge
related to Antarctica. The selection process was completed, and 29
projects were contracted. The allocated resources for this action
were R$ 30,000,000.00 (thirty million reais; approximately US
$6,017,500).
General Description
The projects from the CNPq/MCTI-FNDCT Call No. 61/2022 will
expand and enhance the scientific dissemination produced by
oceanic and Antarctic science to a wider audience, aiming to
influence decision-making in public management, strengthen and
engage society in sustainable development, bringing the results of
this research closer to public managers, policy makers, and various
stakeholders in society.
On the other hand, the projects from the CNPq/MCTI/FNDCT Call
No. 08/2023 will investigate the connections between the Antarctic
and Brazilian environments, expanding knowledge on the subject
and prioritizing the scientific guidelines of the Brazilian Decennial
Plan for Antarctic Science (presented in a specific information
document) and the National Committee for Antarctic Research
(CONAPA), which are in line with the Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR).
Some equity and access mechanisms have been included in these
two project calls, among which are: a) A minimum of 30% (thirty
percent) of the resources was allocated to projects whose executing
institution was headquartered in the North, Northeast, or Midwest
regions, including the respective coverage areas of the Regional
Development Agencies (FNDCT). This allocation aims to reduce
asymmetries between the regions of Brazil regarding access to
research funding.
b) A minimum of 30% (thirty percent) of the resources was
allocated to projects whose coordination was carried out by a
female researcher. This directive aims to promote gender equality
also in project coordination actions, ensuring that women are
present from the development of research proposals to the
execution and measurement of scientific results obtained in the
Antarctic region.
Additionally, the CNPq/MCTI/FNDCT Call No. 08/2023 features
funding lines, with emphasis on the selection and incentive for
young polar researchers (line 5), as well as strengthening and
engaging society in environmental conservation and the importance
of the Antarctic region for the planet, expanding the dissemination
of Brazilian and global Antarctic science results through its
communication channels, thus allowing closer alignment between
research results and public managers, policy makers, and various
audiences in our society.
Below are the research lines of call No. 08/2023:
Line 1 - Cryosphere, atmospheric dynamics, and climate change:
Intended for projects that contemplate the role of the cryosphere in
the Earth system and its interactions with South America, or the
dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere in Antarctica,
interactions with the geospace and connections with the South
American tropical region, or climate change and the Southern
Ocean.
Line 2 - Antarctic biodiversity: Intended for projects that
contemplate Antarctic biodiversity, the impact of climate change,
and connections with South America and the Arctic.
Line 3 - Geodynamics, Ocean Chemistry, and Marine Pollution:
Intended for projects that contemplate the geodynamics and
geological history of Antarctica and its relations with South
America, or ocean chemistry, marine geochemistry, and marine
pollution.
Line 4 - Human and Social Sciences, and Polar Health: Intended for
projects that contemplate human and social sciences or human
biology and polar health.
Line 5 - Emerging Research Group Projects: Intended for projects
that contemplate at least one of the topics of the previous lines,
whose coordinator obtained the doctorate degree after 2012.
Line 6 - Public Communication: Intended for projects that
contemplate public communication and scientific dissemination.
Another aspect highlighted in this Call 08/2023 is the promotion of
research that contemplates the existing interactions between
Antarctica and the Arctic.
