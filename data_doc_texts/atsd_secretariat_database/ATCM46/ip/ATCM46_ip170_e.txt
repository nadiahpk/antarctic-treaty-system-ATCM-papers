Plastic and Microplastic pollution in marine and coastal areas of
Fildes Peninsula: a comprehensive diagnosis for one of the main and
most accessible logistic hubs for Antarctica
Summary
Antarctica is currently facing several anthropogenic pressures,
inlcuding plastic and microplastic pollution. The AntarPLAST
Project was launched as a research initiative to generate a
comprehensive diagnosis of plastic and microplastic pollution in
marine-coastal areas of the Fildes Peninsula (King George Island /
Isla 25 de Mayo). The Antarctic scientific community has stressed
the need for valid and comparable scientific information for
decision-making on this threat, and the InSync Program seems a
great opportunity to foster it in a coordinated and collaborative
manner.
Introduction
Despite its remote and pristine nature, Antarctica faces considerable
conservation challenges. The rising human activities (i.e. tourism,
scientific and logistics) and their associated pressures, along with
various impacts, pose a significant threat to the diverse values of
this continent (Chown & Brooks 2019, Cavanagh et al. 2021,
Morley et al. 2021). The pervasive nature of plastic pollution, with
its enduring nature and high mobility in the marine-oceanic
environment and the atmosphere, has also reached Antarctica likely
from local sources but also lower latitudes (e.g. ATCM42 IP033,
ATCM42 IP133, ATCM42 WP14, ATCM44 BP13, Barnes and Fraser
2003, Caruso et al. 2022, Rota et al. 2022).
The Antarctic community has required scientific research on plastics
and microplastics in the Southern Ocean, seeking to generate
information and knowledge that support evidence-based decision-
making on plastic pollution prevention (ATCM42 IP033, ATCM42
WP014). In particular, the CCAMLR and SCAR, recognized the
generation of baseline information as a priority and promoted
research, monitoring, and opportunistic sampling of plastic and
microplastic pollution among Member States (e.g. CCAMLR 2015,
2019, Waller et al. 2017, Waller & Hughes 2018, Lacerda et al.
2019, Convey 2020, Waluda et al. 2020, Caruso et al. 2022, Rota et
al. 2022).
AntarPLAST Project
Aligned with this concern, Uruguay has been participating in the
CCAMLR Marine Debris Program since 2001 despite being a
relatively new area of research in our country. In 2018, the
AntarPLAST Project (Centro Universitario Regional del Este,
Universidad de la República) was launched as a research initiative
focused solely on plastic pollution in Antarctica. The main objective
of our project is to generate a comprehensive diagnosis of plastic
and microplastic (MP) pollution in marine and coastal areas of
Fildes Peninsula (King George Island /Isla 25 de Mayo) near the
Uruguayan Antarctic Scientific Base Artigas (BCAA), and contribute
information as a baseline for future monitoring programs.
From a multi-matrix analysis, we assess plastic and microplastic
density, size, types, and polymer composition in beaches and coasts,
marine surface seawater, marine sediments, meltwater streams, and
lakes. In addition, we are studying plastics and microplastics
interactions with Antarctic wildlife (e.g. skuas, fishes, penguins,
marine benthic organisms, stream invertebrates, zooplankton, and
bacteria), combining field and experimental approaches. Our
project has been able to determine the presence of plastics and MPs
in all environmental
matrices studied (e.g. González-Pleiter et al. 2021, Lenzi et al.
2022), including primary MPs such as pellets, ﬁrst reported for
Antarctic beaches (Lozoya et al., 2022). The presence of primary
MPs south of 62°S was significant as it highlights the possible direct
impact of these pollutants on Antarctic ecosystems and provides
evidence of the passive entry of plastic debris from lower latitudes
through cross-frontal exchanges. In 2023, we expanded our research
area to the Uruguayan Ruperto Elichiribehety Station (ECARE) at
Hope Bay/Bahía Esperanza. For the last seven years, we have
contributed systematically to the CCAMLR Marine Debris Program
database.
InSync as an opportunity for a joint step forward
Among some of the lessons learned during these years of research
on plastics and microplastics in Antarctic ecosystems (Lozoya et al.
in press), we would like to highlight the need for harmonization
and standardization of methodologies (sampling, analysis and
monitoring), an urgent and crucial need that has already been
widely mentioned (e.g. Waller et al. 2017, Waluda et al. 2020,
Caruso et al. 2022, Rota et al. 2022).
In this sense, the Antarctica InSync Program (International Science
and Infrastructure for Synchronous Observation) seems to be a great
opportunity for the Antarctic scientific community working on
plastic and MPs pollution. InSync is ‘a program of synchronous
scientific observations aimed at providing a circumpolar assessment
of the links between ice, ocean, climate, environment, and life,
including human pressures and possible solutions such as marine
protection’, which already enjoys the support of numerous leaders
of Antarctic scientific research institutions and agencies (ATCM45
IP059). In close collaboration with SCAR, and as a contribution to
this Scientific Committee and to the regional and thematic
programs of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences for
Sustainable Development, this coordinated and synchronous pan-
Antarctic mission aims to unite national Antarctic programs to
achieve collaborative and synergetic actions that improve our
understanding of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica and promote
their protection and sustainable management. An InSync Marine
Debris, Plastics & Microplastics initiative involving groups and
programs in the Antarctic Treaty system (e.g. SCAR AG, CCAMLR
Marine Debris Program, COMNAP/Latin American Antarctic
Program Managers Meeting-RAPAL working groups) would
certainly improve the research and scientific information available
for decision-making. Furthermore, it would promote collaborative
efforts and allow for a more efficient use of existing technical and
logistical resources. The unique collaborative framework of the
Antarctic Treaty should drive all stakeholders towards the ultimate
goal of managing this common anthropogenic threat.
