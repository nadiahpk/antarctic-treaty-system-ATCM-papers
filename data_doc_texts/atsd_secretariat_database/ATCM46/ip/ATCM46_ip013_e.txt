Changes in Antarctic microalgae may impact seals, penguins,
whales and other higher predators
An Information Paper submitted by Portugal, France, the United
Kingdom
Summary
This paper reports scientific evidence that the abundance of groups
of microalgae are changing (i.e. from diatoms to cryptophytes). A
research study based on an 11-year (2008–2018) in-situ dataset,
showed that environmental conditions are favoring a type of
microalgae (cryptophyte) in coastal regions of the western Antarctic
Peninsula, leading to the increase in their overall abundance and
biomass. These results can have significant future implications at
various levels of Antarctic marine food webs, as Antarctic krill
prefer feeding on diatoms and Antarctic krill top predators may be
impacted. Following ATCM and CEP strategic work plans, this
research reenforces the importance of (long-term) monitoring
programmes of Antarctic flora and fauna to inform management
actions.
Introduction
It is essential to provide the best available science to inform
policymakers regarding the state of the Antarctic environment and
its ecosystems (ATCM XLV/WP42) in order to accelerate the
development and implementation of effective policies within the
Antarctic Treaty area (ATCM XLII Final Report (para. 48)) (Chown
et al. 2022). For example, there is a need to understand how the
Southern Ocean responds to climate change and for there to be a
long-term commitment to the monitoring of Southern Ocean
ecosystems (ATCMXL/IP24) (Kennicutt II et al. 2014, Xavier et al.
2016, Janssen et al. 2022). The need for such information has been
expressed in the ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan, CEP Five-
year Work Plan and CEP Climate Change Response Work
Programme (CCRWP) (see ATCM XL (Decision 1 (2017)),
ATCMXLII/WP21, ATCMXLII/WP36, ATCM XLII/WP32) as well as
in the Helsinki Declaration on Climate Change and the Antarctic
(ATCM XLVI Final Report; Resolution 2 (2023)).
The Southern Ocean is changing rapidly, with environmental
changes particularly pronounced in the western Antarctic Peninsula,
which is one of the World´s most sensitive regions to climate
change (Turner et al. 2014, Wallis et al. 2023). Here, we report a
research study, involving scientists from Portugal, Brazil, France
and the United Kingdom, on changes at the base of the Antarctic
marine food webs, in the microalgae (phytoplankton) community,
in the western Antarctic Peninsula, that could have an effect across
marine food webs (Mendes et al. 2023).
Microalgal composition in the western Antarctic Peninsula
In the western Antarctic Peninsula, the group of microalgae know
as cryptophytes are gradually outgrowing another group of
microalgae called diatoms. A research study based on a 11-year
(2008–2018) in-situ dataset has concluded that environmental
conditions are favoring cryptophyte success in coastal regions of the
western Antarctic Peninsula (Mendes et al. 2023). Due to increased
ice melting, conditions of high light stress in western Antarctic
Peninsula are becoming more frequent in the Antarctic coastal
waters, favoring cryptophytes (Mendes et al. 2023).
An increase in the overall abundance and biomass of the group of
microalgae of cryptophytes can have significant future implications
at various levels of the marine food web. For instance, Antarctic
krill in western Antarctic Peninsula is known to feed more on
diatoms, their preferred food (Cleary et al. 2018); therefore a shift
towards cryptophytes can consequently have an impact in Antarctic
krill predators in western Antarctic Peninsula (Mendes et al. 2023).
This would cause significant ecological implications in the climate
change-impacted fragile ecosystem of the western Antarctic
Peninsula, with a potential impact in the Antarctic krill stocks,
which can threaten Antarctic marine wildlife dependent on
Antarctic krill, such as species of penguins, seals and whales.
Overall, this research provides scientific evidence on microalgae
changes in the base of western Antarctic Peninsula marine food
web, its potential negative effects and emphasizes the importance of
(long-term) monitoring programmes of Antarctic flora and fauna to
inform management actions.
