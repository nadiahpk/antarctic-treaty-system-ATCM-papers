Proposed Measures to Upgrade the Management Plan of ASPA N°
150, Ardley Island, Maxwell Bay, King George Island (25 de Mayo)
Summary
The conservation of the values of the ASPA N° 150 began with a
proposal from Chile in 1991. The management plan of ASPA N°150
was approved in 2009, and its latest version was revised in 2014 by
the GSPG. This document presents the resolution of the SGMP
comments, within the scientific advances of the last fifteen years,
and the new conservation measures to protect the values of Ardley
Island.
Introduction
A proposal led by Chile to protect avian, plants and lichens values
of Ardley Island started in 1991, a process that nowadays includes
the whole island within ASPA N°150. The latest version of the
management plan (MP) is from 2009, and to update it in 2014, a
new document was submitted to the SGMP for peer review. ATCM
46 offers the ASPA proponent the opportunity to submit an
information paper on the MP improvement measures carried out in
collaboration with the parties operating in and near the Fildes
Peninsula. This document presents the improvements of the MP,
including the resolution of the SGMP commentaries, as well as
scientific advances of last fifteen years, which have served as a
substrate for proposing measures to promote the conservation of the
values of ASPA N° 150. Although the document is almost drafted,
the maps of the MP still need to be updated to complete the final
version. For this reason, the presentation of this information paper
provides an opportunity for Members to assess progress, express
concerns, and reach agreements before the next ATCM.
Below is the summary of the solved commentaries of the SGMP,
which are included in the new MP version.
A paragraph clarifying the primary reason for the designation of the
ASPA is included. This is the conservation of bird diversity, as three
penguin species occur in the island, and also because it host other
flying birds including skuas and petrels. A secondary value to
protect in the island are mosses and lichens.
1.- Limitation of people working simultaneously in the area will be
limited to ten, and the permit allowing entry to ASPA should be
presentable in English. (chapter 7 (ii)).
2.- The sentence “there is a fuel storage for emergency cases at
Refugio Ballve” is included in chapter 6 (iii).
3.- The point coordinates are depicted in maps and texts to give
more information about the ASPA access.
4.- To provide information about how the site complements the
Antarctic Protected Areas system, the following paragraph was
added: “Ardley Island contributes to a unique ecosystem where
three penguin species simultaneously inhabit. Moreover, the island
has a unique diversity of lichens, algae, and mosses.” According to
the Environmental Domains Analysis for Antarctica (Resolution 3,
2008), the area lies within Environment G - Antarctic Peninsula
Offshore Island geologic. Under the Antarctic Conservation
Biogeographic Regions (v2) (Resolution 3, 2017), the area lies
within ACBR 3 - North-West Antarctic Peninsula.
Below is a summary of the scientific advances developed in the last
fifteen years.
This section also solves part of the SGMP commentaries regarding
maps and figures.
Map 1 (general view showing King George Island (25 de Mayo) is
replaced to improve the resolution. Images were obtained from the
Quantartctica QGIS package.
Map 3 will be replaced by an RGB and infrared orthophotography
mosaic obtained with Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS).
This was achieved in March 2024 in collaboration with the Instituto
Antártico Uruguayo (IAU), and the Instituto Antártico
Chileno (INACH). Information about areas for tourist landing, radio
beacons, lighthouses, and refuges have been added to the map.
These structures are also mentioned in the text.
Figure 1 is complemented with an orthophotography mosaic of the
borders of the colonies and the nest location of the penguins (Figure
1). Data were obtained in December 2023 during the 36th (Chinese
National Antarctic Research Expedition) CHINARE.
Figure 1.- Portion of the Ardley Island showing the location of nest
and penguin colonies.
An update of Table 2 with the vegetal species, including lichens,
can be added (according to findings of So, et al. 2023). This
information has been shared by the Korean Polar Research Institute
(KOPRI) and the CHINARE.
A complement of Table 2 of the MP, where the number of
reproductive penguins is listed according to the results obtained by
KOPRI and the researchers from the University of Jena, Germany
(see table 1). Likewise, the migratory habits of penguins are
presented as published in Yang et al. 2019 and Machado-Gaye A. et
al. 2024. Finally, bird species found during 40th CHINARE are also
included.

Table 1. Changes in the populations of the penguins at Ardley
Island.
Findings related to climate change have shown that native plants
could spread further south or to higher latitudes, while species from
sub-Antarctic latitudes could succeed them. For example, such
spatial shifts or expansions have been documented for two native
flowering plants in Fildes Peninsula. An expansion of endemic
flowering plants into areas colonized initially by mosses and lichens
due to rising temperatures leads to higher trophic relationships and,
thereby, to changes in the soil formation process. In the long term,
the development of extensive areas of tundra vegetation is
expected. Moreover, because the growth rates of lichens strongly
depend on temperature and the availability of water, regular
monitoring of lichens can provide valuable clues to climate change
(Braun et al. 2017).
Bellow the proposal of the conservation measurements to protect
the values.
Following the SGMP recommendations, as well as the current
research topics carried out in Ardley, the MP suggests implementing
monitoring in the:
- Bird nesting, reproduction, migration, and breading pears.
- Noise pollution effects in fauna where tourist landing is allowed.
- Contaminants from anthropogenic activity and its potential effects
on living organisms.
Based on the empirical experiences of scientific investigation
carried out on Ardley Island, avoiding duplication of research with
the same aim in and between Antarctic polar programs is
recommended. This is intended to reduce the simultaneous work of
researchers in the area.
Several advice regarding scientific behaviour when working on
Ardley Island have been incorporated into the MP to conserve flora
and fauna. Most of these tips have been kindly shared by
researchers from the University of Jena. In addition, some special
restrictions to conserve southern giant petrels have also been
integrated into the MP. Likewise, guidelines for tourist visitors who
land on the allowed beach are included in an appendix in the MP.
Considering the current context of high pathogenic avian influence
(HPAI), drone flights over penguin colonies are recommended to
avoid virus propagation. A paragraph of drone
flight recommendations is included following the alignments of
SCAR Resolución 4 (2008) for RPAS. More specific
recommendations to flight operators are given in the MP to avoid
both flights over the island and near the ASPA.
