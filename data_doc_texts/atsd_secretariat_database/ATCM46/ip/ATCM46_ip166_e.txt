Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment update
Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment update
Summary
SCAR is committed to providing regular updates to the CEP and the
ATCM on Antarctic climate change and the environment. This paper
provides information on recent climate change-related research and
observations that is relevant to the discussions and priorities of the
CEP and the ATCM. It complements the SCAR Antarctic Climate
Change and the Environment (ACCE) Reports, initially published in
2009, subsequently updated through annual submissions to the
CEP/ATCM, and most recently with the ACCE Decadal Synopsis
Report (Chown et al., 2022).
Introduction
In response to a request from the Antarctic Treaty Parties, SCAR
published its Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment
(ACCE) Decadal Synopsis Report in 2022 (Chown et al., 2022;
ATCM XLIV WP30 and ATCM XLIV WP31). A joint CEP/ATCM
session on climate change was convened at ATCM XLV to consider
the implementation of the ACCE recommendations. The resulting
Helsinki Declaration on Climate Change and the Antarctic agreed to
“Invite SCAR to continue to provide annual updates to its ACCE
report and reconfirm our commitment to take account of the best
scientific and technical advice available in taking appropriate
measures to deliver our commitments made in the Protocol on
Environmental Protection for the comprehensive protection of the
Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems”
(ATCM Resolution 3, 2023).
This paper highlights recent research, observations and advances in
understanding of climate change in Antarctica. These research
updates inform the science needs and priorities set out in the CEP
Climate Change Response Work Plan and the ATCM Multi-Year
Strategic Plan.
Key research and observational updates
Global ocean temperatures reached record highs in 2022 and 2023
(Cheng et al., 2023; 2024). Ocean heat content of the world’s
oceans was the highest on record in 2022, with ocean salinity and
upper-ocean stratification also continuing increasing trends.
Changes in temperature and salinity alter the ocean density and
lead to changes in vertical stratification, which acts as a barrier to
water mixing and thus impacts the efficiency of heat, carbon and
oxygen exchange (Li et al., 2020). Changes to the global upper 2000
m ocean heat content have shown an unequivocal warming trend
since 1958, primarily associated with increasing concentrations of
greenhouse gases. A regional long term warming trend is also
evident in the Southern Ocean (Cheng et al., 2023).
Antarctic sea ice extent dropped below 2 million sq km in 2024 for
the third year in a row (NSIDC, 2024). Following consecutive
record lows in 2022 and 2023 (Liu et al., 2023, the trend of
anomalously low summer sea ice extent has continued in 2024 with
a minimum extent of 1.99 million sq km on 20 February 2024
(NSIDC, 2024). This is the second lowest extent since satellite
records began in 1979, and anomalies were evident in all regions
around the Antarctic (Gilbert & Holmes, 2024), in contrast to
previous years when. Sea ice remained at record low extent for all
of 2023, with winter sea ice also reaching a new record low
maximum extent of 16.96 million sq km on 10 September 2023.
Consequences of a continuing low sea ice extent include warmer
Antarctic coastal air temperature, reduced buttressing of fast ice
and ice-shelf fronts and changes in deep water and bottom water
formation leading to changes in ocean circulation and temperature
(Reid et al, 2023).
Observational evidence now suggests a transition to a ‘new regime’
of low sea ice extent (Hobbs et al., 2024). Recent record low sea ice
extents, together with increased sea ice variance during summer,
are consistent with theoretical indicators of a critical transition or
‘regime shift’ in the state of the system. While the physical
mechanisms driving this change are still uncertain, several
atmospheric drivers are thought to have contributed to the recent
record lows, including an unusually prolonged La Niña event, and a
persistent positive Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) leading to a stronger,
southwestward shift in the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL; a low pressure
region centred over the Amundsen Sea) and associated onshore
wind advection (Lin et al., 2023). New research has also
demonstrated that Southern Ocean subsurface warming has played
a previously unappreciated role in the new sea ice extent lows being
observed (Purich & Doddridge 2023).
Antarctica is likely warming at almost twice the rate of the rest of
the world (Casado et al., 2023), and this warming can be attributed
to human activities (Dalaiden et al., 2022; González-Herrero et al.,
2022). Antarctica is warming at a range of 0.22°C and 0.32°C per
decade, compared to 0.18°C predicted by climate models. Combined
with record low sea-ice extent, this amplified warming has
important implications for melting ice shelves, which if they thin or
collapse will accelerate mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet and
global sea level rise (Casado et al., 2023). Observed climate changes
in West Antarctica since the 1950s, including a regional ‘heatwave’
in 2020, are out of the range of natural variability and can be
attributed to the increase of greenhouse gases and stratospheric
ozone depletion (Dalaiden et al., 2022; González-Herrero et al.,
2022).
There is increasing evidence that global heating of 1.1°C to date has
led to the increased occurrence and severity of extreme
environmental events in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (Siegert
et al., 2023). Atmospheric heatwaves, record low sea ice extent, ice
shelf collapse, marine heatwaves and increased snow accumulation
may result in considerable stress and damage to Antarctica’s
environments and ecosystems. ‘Cascades’ of extreme events in the
future may have wide-ranging linked impacts in multiple realms,
and be difficult to predict. It is virtually certain that continued
greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increases in the size and
frequency of extreme events, and the need to assess the
consequences of such events is increasingly urgent.
Atmospheric rivers transport large amounts of moisture from mid-
to high-latitudes, driving extreme snowfall events, surface melting
(Maclennan et al., 2023) and sea ice reduction (Liang et al., 2023).
The spatial variability of extreme precipitation associated with
atmospheric rivers over Antarctica is poorly understood, however
recent analysis shows that such events over the Amundsen Sea and
Marie Byrd Land regions in West Antarctica increased in frequency
from 1980 to 2020. If such extremes are amplified in the future
climate, there may be more frequent surface melting in West
Antarctica which could impact ice shelf stability (Maclennan et al.,
2022). Atmospheric rivers may also contribute to sea ice reduction
at the sea ice edge as recently shown by retrospective analyses of
sea ice variation and atmospheric changes during atmospheric river
events (Liang et al. 2023).
Further work
SCAR Scientific Research Programmes on Antarctica’s contribution
to sea level change (INSTANT), near-term variability and prediction
of the Antarctic climate system (AntClimNow) and integrated
science to inform Antarctic and Southern Ocean conservation (Ant-
ICON) are working to address high priority topical areas with a
focus on the effects of change in and from Antarctica. SCAR is also
working closely with partners including the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP) and the Southern Ocean Observing System
(SOOS) to
develop tools and data visualisations to inform policy discussions
and facilitate collaborative research and monitoring.
Following the CCAMLR Scientific Committee workshop on climate
change (September 2023), SCAR is working to address some of the
specific workshop recommendations which may be useful to both
the CEP and SC-CAMLR, for example on developing:
a framework for using climate models to drive ecological
projections;
a glossary of climate related terms and definitions;
advice on best practise for selecting, using and communicating
earth system models, regional climate models and emission
scenarios; and
work to identify environmental monitoring and observation needs
and potential sources of existing data.
This work may also be relevant in informing the proposed Joint
CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop on climate change and monitoring in
2025.
