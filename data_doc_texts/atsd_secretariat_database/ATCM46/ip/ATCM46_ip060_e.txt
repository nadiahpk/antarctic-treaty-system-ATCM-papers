Teleconnections between Antarctica, the Southern Ocean, and the
Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall
Teleconnections between Antarctica, the Southern Ocean, and the
Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall
Summary
Recent changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in
the Southern Ocean and the surrounding Antarctica (due to
atmospheric and oceanic warming) affect the strength and position
of the westerly winds encircling Antarctica. These changes disturb
the weather patterns in distant regions, including the Indian Ocean
and Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR). Despite the lack of a
clear physical link between Antarctica and the ISMR, the
teleconnection through large-scale atmospheric and oceanic
circulation patterns demonstrates how changes in one region of the
globe can influence weather and climate patterns in distant areas,
including the Indian subcontinent. Though Antarctica's influence on
ISMR may seem distant, the cascading effects of climate change on
global weather patterns ultimately impact the ISMR and the society
at large through its effects on agriculture, water resources, extreme
weather events, sea level rise and overall socioeconomic well-being.
Understanding these teleconnections is crucial for improving
seasonal climate predictions and enhancing our understanding of
global climate dynamics.
Introduction
Antarctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) has increased at a small but
significant rate of 2% per decade from 1979–2015. However, an
unexpected and abrupt reduction in the extent of Antarctic sea ice
started in 2016 1 and is continuing. It could be a result of the
interaction of a decade-long ocean warming trend 2 and an early
spring southward advection of atmospheric heat, with an
exceptional weakening of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude
westerlies in late spring 3. A considerable decline in sea-ice cover in
the Antarctic is expected by the end of this century 4 .
The sea ice grows around the Antarctic continent towards the north
up to ~55 ◦ S. The Southern Ocean sea ice (SOSI) is one of the
important drivers of regional and global climate due to its vital role
in the ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions through thermal insolation
and albedo modulation. Sudden reduction in sea ice in the Southern
Hemisphere and accelerated thinning of the Antarctic ice sheet
post-2015 leads to variability in atmospheric and oceanic
circulation. Subsequently, it generates stationary Rossby wave
trains with alternating centres of high-pressure and low-pressure
anomalies, leading to a tropical polar teleconnection. The
fluctuations in the major climate modes, such as the El Niño-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode
(SAM), influence the variability of the SOSI on the intraseasonal,
interannual, and decadal scales.
The Mascarene High sub-tropical high-pressure zone serves as a
conduit between the Southern Ocean temperature and the ISMR,
which in turn affects the fluctuation of the SOSI 5,6,7. The Indian
summer monsoon circulation originates in the oceanic region of the
southern hemisphere, where the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)
displays a flip-flop mass distribution between middle and high
latitudes. The Indian monsoon system is a part of the general
atmospheric circulation that links with various regional and global
scale processes. The ISMR is a major weather pattern that
dominates the Indian climate system from June until September,
accounting for more than three quarters of annual precipitation
over the Indian subcontinent. The summer monsoon rainfall is
crucial for the socioeconomic stability of India and its neigbhouring
regions.
Potential link between Antarctic sea ice variability and Indian
Summer Monsoon Rainfall
The weakening/strengthening of the Mascarene High showed a
strong linkage between SOSI (in April–June) and the ISMR in
Peninsular India 8 . High (low) sea ice extent intensified
(weakened) the Mascarene High, enhancing (reducing) the south-
westerlies, causing increased (decreased) summer monsoon rainfall
in Peninsular India, leading to a positive interaction between sea ice
and ISMR (Figure 1). The most robust relationship was obtained
from the Bellingshausen–Amundsen Sea (BAS) sector in autumn.
Therefore, it indicates that the excess ISMR (deficit) events were
linked to a significant negative (positive) sea ice concentration
anomaly in the BAS. This linkage possibly occurred through ENSO-
related sea surface temperature having dominant oscillations in 2 to
8-year frequency bands similar to the ENSO tropical teleconnections
9. The Antarctic – Southern Ocean teleconnection with the Indian
summer monsoon is also evident in studies based on reconstructed
past climate data on geological timescales. Record of past Indian
monsoon variability reconstruced from sediment core data in the
upstream monsoon region in the southern hemisphere revealed a
highly coherent pattern with the Antarctic climate variability
during the last two glacial cycles. Warm (cold) conditions in
Antarctica were phase-linked to weak (strong) monsoon circulation
during the studied interval covering the past ~145,000 years 10.
Further, reconstruction of quantitative climate data in the Indian
sector of the Southern Ocean during the last glacial period revealed
that the impacts of both northern high latitude and Antarctic
climate variability could be transmitted to the Indian monsoon
system with Southern Mid-Latitude climate as an atmospheric and
oceanic bridge 11. Additionally, paleoclimate studies on orbital
timescale have revealed that variability of Antarctic climate and the
Southern Ocean (sea ice and frontal shifts) via changes in Agulhas
leakage may have partly impacted the ISMR 12. However, more
such studies are critical in tackling the fundamental paleoclimate
question of whether, or to what extent, glacial and inter-glacial
climate is being forced from high versus low latitudes.
The SIE over the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Sea Sector (BASS)
during the austral summer (October–December) shows an inverse
relationship with the ISMR of the following year (Prabhu et al.
2010). When a positive (negative) SAM occurs during February–
March, it is favourable (unfavourable) for the subsequent summer
monsoon rainfall over the Indian sub-continent and a negative
(positive) phase of (February–March) SAM occurs, it gives rise to an
anomalous meridional circulation in a longitudinally locked air–sea
coupled system over the central Pacific. The above mechanism
induces a warming effect over the equatorial Pacific region and
simultaneously weakens (strengthens) the monsoon rainfall over the
Indian sub-continent 7. This effect concomitantly weakens
(strengthens) the monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent.
Thus, the February–March SAM could serve as a new precursor to
predict the subsequent behaviour of the ISMR and reveal that SAM
has a strong linkage with the circulation and precipitation pattern
of the Indian summer monsoon 13. Apart from the ISMR, a
reduction in SOSI led to a rise in a few centimeter change in swell
height in the North Indian Ocean 14.
These teleconnections have contributed to observed Antarctic and
Southern Ocean changes, including regional rapid surface warming,
pre-2015 sea ice expansion and its sudden reduction thereafter,
changes in ocean heat content and accelerated thinning of most of
the Antarctic ice sheet. Antarctic Sea-Ice loss also causes enhanced
warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific and an equatorward
intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone 4. Though
Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent are far apart, the cascading
effects of climate change on global weather patterns ultimately
impact the ISMR and society at large through its effects on
agriculture, water resources, extreme weather events, sea level rise
and overall socioeconomic well-being. Most of the work has
examined the teleconnections from the Antarctic Sea Ice variability
and southern Ocean warming to the ISMR (tropics). Similarly,
variability in the tropics can also interact with different climate
conditions in Antarctica, which needs more attention. It requires
developing new collaboration between nations and initiating a
Polar-tropical teleconnection study, which will give more
comprehensive results.
