Preparation of the 47th Meeting 2025
Preparation of the 47th Meeting 2025
Italy reiterates its commitment to host the ATCM 47 in 2025. At
present Italy is in the process of selecting the location of the event.
The selection will imply a tendering process whose outcome is
expected in the next few months.
Italy will inform the Membership via the Antarctic Treaty
Secretariat about the outcome of the process and will provide in
due time all the relevant information to allow accurate preparation
for the next ATCM.
In 2025, Italy will mark 40 years of its National Research Program
in Antarctica and 20 years since the French-Italian Concordia
Station began operating, one of just three year-round stations atop
Antarctica's 3300m ice cap.
