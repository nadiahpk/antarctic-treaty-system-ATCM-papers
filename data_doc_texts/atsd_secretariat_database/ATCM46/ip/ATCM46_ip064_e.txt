Considerations for conducting and reporting on remotely piloted
aircraft system (RPAS) surveys of penguin colonies
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and the United
States
Summary
The use of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) to study
penguin colonies is becoming increasingly common. To ensure the
transition from traditional on-ground survey methods does not
compromise the continuity of existing datasets, it is necessary to re-
evaluate the procedures for using RPAS to ensure they are fit for
purpose. This paper describes some of the factors that require
consideration, and describes potential future opportunities to
expand on available guidelines for conducting and reporting on
RPAS surveys, including flying protocols, standards for the imagery
collected, methods for image interpretation, and environmental
considerations.
Background
The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP; Agnew 1997)
describes internationally accepted methods to collect standardised
data on breeding population size and breeding success of several
penguin species (CCAMLR 2014). These methods have been used
since the 1980s, and largely involve on-ground methods to assess
the number of nests, eggs and chicks within colonies. The
standardised nature of these approaches means that trends can be
monitored and compared across distinct sites, and any changes to
populations detected.
In recent years, the use of RPAS to survey penguin nesting success
has become more common. RPAS offer a quick and reliable method
of surveying penguin colonies, and have a range of potential
benefits, including reducing disturbance, facilitating surveys in
areas that are difficult to access, and capturing images of colonies
that provide a range of additional information (Dunn et al. 2021).
Now that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has reached
the Antarctic Peninsula, it is increasingly critical to maintain long-
term records into the future to understand the impacts of major
infections. RPAS offer a method to do so, as HPAI may reduce
opportunities for ground counts.
Guidelines exist to assist with conducting Environmental Impact
Assessments for decision-making in relation to RPAS (Resolution 4
2018; COMNAP 2023), and there is some guidance focusing on
survey protocol (Mustafa et al. 2018). Additionally, IAATO has
policies that limit the use of RPAS to certain locations and purposes
(IAATO 2016). However, as yet there is limited guidance available
on the procedures for interpreting and reporting on data collected
using RPAS.
To ensure that the data collected during RPAS surveys are
comparable to data collected by traditional on-ground methods, and
can accurately be used to make management recommendations, it is
essential to develop standardised approaches for all aspects of
surveying using RPAS. That requires outlining standards for flying
protocols, as well as the imagery collected, methods for interpreting
the images, and reporting findings. Further, the reports of survey
activities necessarily require appropriate meta-data.
Additionally, to accurately document population trends over longer
timeframes and interpret possible causes of change, there are
additional factors to consider beyond survey methodology. These
include environmental factors that can result in changes in nest
numbers across several temporal scales. For example, climate
change is likely to result in long-term changes to the
timing of penguin nesting cycles (known as breeding phenology;
Lynch et al. 2012), whilst one-off weather events can result in nest
abandonment. The CEMP methodology involves repeat surveys to
ensure that peak nesting population size is captured. In contrast,
RPAS surveys are often conducted opportunistically, making the
opportunity to capture peak nesting less likely. Such factors further
complicate assessments, making between-year and methodological
comparisons of nesting success challenging.
Recent developments
Oceanites has begun investigating the differences between on-
ground and RPAS survey methodologies. During the 2023/24
Antarctic season, Oceanites conducted 105 site visits across 54 sites
on the Peninsula. Some sites were surveyed on-ground and using a
RPAS during the same visit, offering the opportunity to compare
results obtained from both methods, and from repeat counts of the
same RPAS imagery by different individuals. The extent of
similarity between counts varied by site (Table 1).

Oceanites do not apply the CEMP method to on-ground surveying as
surveys are conducted opportunistically via expedition ships, so it is
also helpful to examine sites where RPAS surveys and on-ground
CEMP methods are applied. A small number of sites are vital for
this purpose. For example, Goudier Island, which has a population
of gentoo penguins that have been surveyed by the UK Antarctic
Heritage Trust (UKAHT) and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS)
using CEMP methods since 1996/97 (Cobley & Shears 1999;
Trathan et al. 2008; Dunn et al. 2019). There have also been RPAS
surveys in several recent seasons, with results again showing
variable levels of agreement between methods (Table 2; Flynn et al.
2023).

researchers from Stony Brook, Cornell and Oxford Brookes
Universities and are available in Flynn et al. (2023), except the
2023/24 survey which was by Oceanites

Data from on-ground CEMP surveys suggests that the timing of
breeding at Goudier Island (and elsewhere) is becoming delayed
(Dunn et al. 2020). This highlights the importance of
considering changes to breeding phenology when assessing changes
in nesting numbers, particularly counts derived from opportunistic
RPAS surveys, and when comparing results obtained by on-ground
and RPAS survey methods.
Future opportunities
The transition from on-ground to RPAS counts in the face of HPAI,
and in the context of climate change and observed phenological
changes, highlights the need for standardisation of RPAS survey
methods, if data are to be useful for management purposes. The
authors have therefore identified opportunities to build on the
existing guidelines for operating RPAS in Antarctica outlined in
Resolution 4 (2018) and supporting literature (e.g., Mustafa et al.
2018). So far, guidelines have largely focused on reducing
environmental impacts and survey protocol, so there is now the
opportunity for a collaborative approach to provide additional
guidelines on the following suggested topics:
Survey protocols:
Height above ground-level (considering enhanced restrictions due
to HPAI)
Safe environmental conditions
Launching on land and from watercraft
Imagery collected:
Image resolution (e.g., minimum requirements and reporting of
resolution)
Environmental conditions during survey (e.g., precipitation,
windspeed)
Image interpretation:
Classifying nesting vs. non-nesting penguins
Number of individuals involved in image interpretation
Number of repeat counts for image interpretation
Reporting results:
Potential influence of survey timing and breeding phenology on the
outcome
Conclusions
Having additional guidelines on RPAS survey protocols, image
quality, image interpretation and reporting requirements would
help to standardise penguin nesting data collected during RPAS
surveys. Such guidelines would help to ensure that any transition
from on-ground to RPAS surveys would not jeopardise existing
datasets, and ensure data are interpreted consistently and correctly,
which is essential when making management recommendations.
