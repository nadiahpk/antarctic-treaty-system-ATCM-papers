Antarctic Sea Ice Dynamics in a Changing Climate: Insights from
Long-Term Observations
Summary
The Antarctic region is undergoing significant changes, as the
receding sea ice leads to ecological shifts and the potential
destabilization of ice shelves. In 2023, Antarctic sea ice reached its
second consecutive lowest extent after decades of consistent
growth. Various factors, such as ozone depletion, oceanic patterns,
and ice sheet melting, have been proposed to explain these
fluctuations. However, a consensus remains elusive. Unforeseen
declines in sea ice extent, especially in the Weddell Sea, have been
observed since 2015. These declines have been attributed to earlier
seasonal retreats and increased ocean heat content. Multiple factors,
including deep atmospheric circulation patterns and large-scale
weather phenomena, have contributed to record-low sea ice
conditions in recent years. These trends emphasize the importance
of continued research and collaborative efforts on a global scale to
understand and address the complex dynamics of Antarctic sea ice.
This understanding is essential for climate resilience and ecosystem
preservation.
Introduction
The environmental shifts in Antarctica are significant and intense,
as seen in the receding sea ice. This is resulting in various
ecological changes, such as alterations in ocean currents, shifts in
marine biodiversity, and the potential destabilization of ice
shelves123. This evolution is presenting a new set of circumstances
that require immediate attention, innovative solutions, and
international cooperation to mitigate the widespread impacts on
both local ecosystems and the global climate system.
In 2023, the global temperature records drew widespread attention.
At the same time, notable events were taking place in the Antarctic
Sea ice that were equally remarkable. 2023 was marked as the
second consecutive year of setting record lows, continuing the trend
of unpredictable fluctuations in sea ice coverage after several
decades of consistent and gradual growth.
In recent decades, Antarctic sea ice has shown complex and varying
trends in different regions. Some areas have experienced increases
in ice extent, while others have seen declines. These changes in sea
ice, though occurring at the southernmost point of the planet, have
a significant impact globally, affecting weather patterns, ocean
currents, and ecological systems4. Given the multifaceted impacts
of these factors, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) emphasizes the urgent need for ongoing research to enhance
understanding of Antarctic sea ice dynamics and their effects on
global climate and ecosystems. It is crucial to monitor and
comprehend the variability of Antarctic sea ice in order to develop
effective strategies for global climate resilience and adaptation.
Here, we report the observed transformations in Antarctic sea ice
and the coupled atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere processes
driving these changes since the satellite era.
Long-term trends in Antarctic sea ice dynamics
Between 2000 and 2014, the expansion of Antarctic sea ice surged
nearly fivefold compared to the rate observed in the preceding two
decades, reaching a peak annual mean sea-ice extent of 12.8 million
km2 in 20145. Various theories have been suggested to explain this
unexpected expansion, including:
Ozone depletion and cyclonic circulation, alongside internal
variability from the tropical Pacific leading to a deeper Amundsen
Sea Low6,7,8,9.
The oceanic and atmospheric patterns associated with the Atlantic
Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
(IPO), the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL), etc. 10,11,12,13
Increased mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet due to ocean
warming and ice-shelf melting results in a cooler upper ocean layer
in autumn and early winter, fostering sea-ice growth 14,15.
Yet, none have resulted in a consensus regarding the underlying
reasons for the long-term increase in Antarctic sea ice.
However, what followed was an unforeseen and rapid decline, with
the annual mean sea-ice extent reaching a record low, nearly 2.1
million km2 below the long-term average, within just three years.
Nearly all areas witnessed significant sea-ice loss, particularly in the
Weddell Sea, while only parts of the western Ross Sea and the
Indian Ocean remained relatively unaffected.
It was observed that this decline was primarily a result of an earlier
and faster seasonal retreat, happening in August instead of the end
of September. This premature loss of sea ice in spring leads to a
higher absorption of solar radiation by the ocean, which speeds up
the melting process. This longer ice-free season also causes the
ocean to absorb more shortwave radiation during the summer
months, which in turn delays the formation of sea ice in autumn16.
Following this, there were multiple years of the lowest sea ice
extent. The summer minimum record in 2022 and 2023 dipped
below 2 million square km2 for the first time since satellite records
began (Fig 1).

sea ice from 1979 to 2023. The black diamonds represent each
year's minimum extent, while the blue line shows a slight decline of
1.0 percent per decade. However, this decrease is not statistically
significant. The red line depicts a smoother trend using a five-year

Regional trends in sea ice extent
Observed changes in sea ice cover across different Antarctic sectors
vary both spatially and seasonally. For example, the Ross Sea has
exhibited an increase in sea ice cover, while the Bellingshausen Sea
has displayed a decrease in the last 45 years17. These regional
differences are closely linked to the variations in wind patterns18.
However, their relationship is rather complex with numerous other
influences contributing to the observed changes.
The Weddell and Ross Seas are known for their crucial roles in
Antarctic climate dynamics, as they contribute most to the observed
decline in sea ice extent19. These regions, along with the Western
Pacific Ocean sector have been characterized by anomalous ocean
warming since 2016, which is concerned to have a profound impact
on the stability of the Antarctic ice sheets2021. One of the most
alarming implications of this ocean warming is its potential impact
on mean air temperatures.
As the ocean warms, it releases heat into the atmosphere,
contributing to the overall increase in air temperatures. This
feedback loop intensifies the already complex dynamics of
Antarctica, leading to further melting of sea ice and escalating
environmental consequences.
Recurring low sea ice conditions and why should it be of concern?
Record-low sea ice conditions in 2022 and 2023 are not attributable
to a single cause, but are likely the result of a combination of
oceanic and atmospheric factors working together. Some possible
factors include:
Increased ocean heat content since 2016 and remarkably warmer
sea surface in recent years22,23
Unusually deep ASL pattern, which altered the wind movement and
temperature in the region, impacting the formation and distribution
of 24,25,24.
Large-scale weather patterns such as Southern Annular Mode and El
Nino Southern Oscillation26.
The warming of the Southern Ocean's subsurface is a critical factor
that impacts the variability and long-term trends of Antarctic sea
ice. This is in addition to the significant influence of large-scale
atmospheric circulation patterns. The atmospheric circulation can
directly affect sea ice extent, both through changes in sea surface
temperature and with a time lag of several months.
Despite the relatively short duration of 45 years for satellite records
and the complications involved in collecting field observations, the
frequent incidents of low sea ice extent indicate an unusual and
concerning event taking place.
From a climatological perspective, the sea ice dynamics, especially
in 2022 and 2023, represent a crucial turning point in our
understanding of Earth's polar regions and how climate change
affects them. Policymakers and society must recognize the need for
united efforts to address the root causes of climate change and
protect the vulnerable ecosystems of polar regions.
