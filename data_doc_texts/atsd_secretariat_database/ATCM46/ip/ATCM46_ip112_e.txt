Overview of Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica – and their

Overview of Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica – and their
priority
Summary
The Norwegian Polar Institute has in collaboration with the
Norwegian Directorate of Cultural Heritage prepared a list of 19
prioritised Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica. The list
contains heritage for which the historical context is of national
value for Norway. The historic remains listed are of different types
and they are spread across the continent. The prioritised list will
provide a basis for assessing management actions.
Background
Since Antarctica was discovered in 1820, relatively few people have
visited the continent, and there are very few visible reminders of
early human activity. Norwegians were active early, and therefore,
among the historic remains in Antarctica, there are several that
have clear connections to Norway.
The Norwegian Government has emphasised that important historic
remains from Norwegian activity in Antarctica should be protected
and managed and that Norway should actively take part in the
international collaboration on Antarctic heritage.
In 2018 the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment tasked
the Norwegian Polar Institute to prepare a list of prioritised
Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica. The list was prepared in
collaboration with the Norwegian Directorate of Cultural Heritage
and was submitted to the Ministry in December 2023.
List of prioritised Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica
The list contains 19 Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica of
which 11 currently are designated as Historic Sites and Monuments
under the Environmental Protocol. The 19 historic remains have
been assessed in three categories: high, medium or low priority. The
list contains five cairns, three heritage sites, two huts, two research
stations, two shipwrecks and two monuments/memorials. Three of
the historic remains in the list, among them Amundsen’s tent, falls
under the “other” category. The historic remains included in the list
are shown in table 1.
Geographically the prioritised Norwegian historic remains in
Antarctica are distributed throughout the entire continent,
including Peter I Øy, the South Pole and the Vestfold Hills, although
the coast of Dronning Maud Land, the Ross Sea area and the
northern part of the Antarctic Penninsula see a larger concentration
and may be considered key areas.
Historic remains with a Norwegian association in Antarctica can
roughly be categorized as linked to i) discovery expeditions, ii)
whaling and resource exploitation and iii) scientific expeditions.
The historic remains are largely linked to several of these
categories, and in addition there are other dimensions such as
territorial interests, international cooperation etc.
Mainly the remains from the whaling industry are found in the
Antarctic Peninsula area, the remains form research activity at the
coast of Dronning Maud land and the remains from discovery
expeditions in the Ross Sea area. All the prioritised historic remains
are shown in the map in figure 1.
The historic remains chosen for the list are the ones that are
considered to have the strongest Norwegian connections. An
assessment has been made as to whether the historic context of the
remains is primarily of value to Norway and Norwegians (national),
or whether the heritage value is associated with a more general
interest and thus has a wider international value. The list focus on
historic remains with particular Norwegian value.

Action plan
The report on prioritised Norwegian historic remains in Antarctica
is not in itself an action plan. It is however meant to provide a basis
for assessing whether and how management measures could be
implemented.
For most of the historic remains “decay with dignity” will be the
preferred strategy, often in combination with information activities
i.e. in connection with anniversaries. Some level of maintenance
might be relevant for a few of the historic remains. Proposals for
new listings as Historic Sites and Monuments could also be relevant
actions.
