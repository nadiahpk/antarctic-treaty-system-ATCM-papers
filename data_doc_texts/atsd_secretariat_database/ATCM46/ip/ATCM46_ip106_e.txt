IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM)
IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM)
An Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Summary
The IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM) is a core document for
all IAATO Operators to enable the practical application of IAATO’s
mission of safe and environmentally responsible tourism to
Antarctica. Updated and circulated annually to IAATO Operators,
the FOM provides all relevant international governance, including
ATCM instruments, as well as IAATO requirements, guidelines,
standard operating procedures and other industry best practice.
Recognizing the benefits of having information related to tourism
activities collated in one place for Competent Authorities, IAATO
will continue to provide any of the Competent Authorities and the
Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with the annually updated FOM if
requested to do so. 
Background
To fulfil the practical implementation of IAATO’s mission of safe
and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to Antarctica,
one of the most important roles for IAATO is to ensure all of the
latest, relevant information is easily available to Operators ranging
from international requirements, guidelines, standard operating
procedures, and industry best practice. The core method for
delivering this information is the IAATO Field Operations Manual
(FOM) first created in 2008-09 (see ATCM XXXII IP087 IAATO Field
Operations Manual). Before the FOM, IAATO Operators created
custom in-house manuals incorporating Antarctic Treaty System
(ATS) and IAATO guidelines and procedures, as well as their own
standard operating procedures. These custom manuals, now
integrated with the FOM, are a core part of Operator procedures.
Since its inception, the FOM has been updated continuously to
incorporate new standard operating procedures, guidelines, report
forms, and applicable decisions by IAATO, ATCM, SCAR, COMNAP,
CCAMLR and other relevant bodies, such as International Maritime
Organization, International Hydrographic Organization, etc.
How the FOM works:
Due to the dynamic nature of field operations and the level of detail
required, the IAATO FOM is a fully electronic manual. Prior to each
Antarctic operating cycle, the FOM is overhauled, updated and
made available online to IAATO Operators. In addition to updating
Operators on requirements, guidelines, report forms and standard
operating procedures, the FOM also serves as the curriculum for the
annual mandatory, operationally specific, IAATO Online
Assessment. Utilizing the same Sync App ATCM does for annual
meeting papers, during the season IAATO loads updates to the FOM
server, where users can then sync their documents to ensure they
have the most up to date information.
The FOM is essential in ensuring that all Operators, and those
representing them in the field (e.g Captains, Senior Officers, Field
Staff, etc), know what is required of them and have easy access to
critical information, despite being resource intensive to maintain.
The FOM also serves as a guide to a plethora of additional
resources. For an overview of 2024-25 Season information
contained in the IAATO FOM, please see the Table of Contents (site
map) listed in Appendix 1.
In 2016, IAATO launched a slimmed-down version of the publicly
accessible FOM and ATS information through an application called
IAATO Polar Guide: Antarctica. It is publicly available for
download for Android and iOS (see ATCM XLII IP 98 Education and
Outreach by IAATO – an update for 2019).
Technology and the needs of the organization have advanced since
the 2016 creation of the IAATO Polar Guide App, and currently
IAATO is in the process for further developing the App to meet a
broader set of goals that are part of IAATO’s Five-Year Strategic
Plan.
IAATO has made the FOM available to Competent Authorities
annually since its inception. Recognizing the benefits of having
information related to tourism activities collated in one place for
Competent Authorities, IAATO will continue to provide Competent
Authorities and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with the annually
updated FOM, if requested to do so.
