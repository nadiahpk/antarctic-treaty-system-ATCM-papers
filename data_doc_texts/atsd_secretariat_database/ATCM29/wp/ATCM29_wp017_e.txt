Contingency Planning and Emergency Response


Thoughts and follow up proposals

The evolution of the legal framework for all activities carried out in Antarctica, with the Madrid Protocol, and after that, more recently, the adoption by the ATCM 28, held in Stockholm, of its Annex VI on Liability, together with the recorded increase in the number of people visiting the white continent, leads us to seriously ponder upon the issue of risk management.

A dual statement of facts is imperative:

    • The first, which lies in acknowledging the fact that several listed accidents have already taken place in Antarctica.
    • The second, which enables us to state that at a global level, management of serious events, and particularly when it affects human lives, is ensured « as best as possible ».

Nevertheless, one would not abide exclusively by this mere statement, without wanting to take this a step further and proposing a more sophisticated approach. In this regard, the papers prepared by COMNAP are especially interesting (cf annexes). 
This approach could be based on the following stages:

I- Review past events

It would simply be a matter of listing, at first, all known accidents which have occurred in Antarctica. 
At the same time, those countries that reportedly managed them, or took cognizance of them, will include it in their feedback. Each event could be the subject of a form uploaded on the ATCM website.

II- To draw up a list of accident sites

It is most likely that certain « informal » procedures are already in place, just like there are, on the field, a certain number of operational means of intervention (specialized teams, air transport means, nautical means, land transport means, etc.)

The fact of making the inventory and linking it to the aspects mentioned in the previous paragraph will enable to detect and ultimately to fill all possible recorded gaps.

III- Anticipate possible events

A potential risk and dangers assessment study would have to be performed, and, subsequently, to draw and use all useful outcomes in terms of:
    • prevention
    • prediction
    • intervention


A simple basic structure is proposed below:

Risk and dangers analyses
Two case studies:
    • the sea
    • the land

    1) the sea
    • shipwreck or ship in distress
    • pollution (for example caused by oil)
    • plane crash
    • MEDEVAC
    • others

    2) the land
    • accident, injury or illness requiring a medevac
    • group of people lost or in remote areas
    • plane crash
    • pollution (if it touches the ground after drifting), and if the need arises, being damaging to animals
    • major fire in a base or accidental explosion
    • others


This entire exercise will result in « an assessment and risk coverage scheme » which will emerge, as quickly as possible, as rescue plans and emergency measures capable of assisting in managing a crisis.


IV- Establish a permanent and reliable alert and alarm procedure

In case of a disaster, and bearing in mind the singularity of the Antarctic continent (isolation, meteorological conditions, distances etc.), it is essential to implement as quickly as possible a reliable alert procedure.

For this purpose, it would undoubtedly be interesting to set up a radio network with frequencies reserved for and dedicated to emergency situations.

Together with this, an alert plan of action should be implemented, with immediate indication on what set off the alarm, so that the operative section can start acting as soon as possible (examples: MEDEVAC, crash, pollution etc.).
This alert and alarm procedure could be tested, on a regular basis, by various drills.

V- Define, in the long run, emergency plans

Of course, the intention is not to « transfer » to Antarctica all alarm and warning mechanisms that are known and used in other areas in the world, land or sea. 

However, it seems useful, indeed indispensable, to have « emergency plans », which will enable us to deal with a major crisis, the most binding of which is linked to the most damaging acts on the environment (pollution, for example).






Initially, these emergency plans could be basic:

    a) definition of the issue in question (medevac, pollution etc.)
    b) alert procedure and how the warning will be broadcast
    c) definition of « who does what »
    d) reminder of available means and time to implement them
    e) feedback form


France proposes, if all Parties agree, to begin intersessional work on points I and II which are easier to deal with and which will enable us to take future steps.
