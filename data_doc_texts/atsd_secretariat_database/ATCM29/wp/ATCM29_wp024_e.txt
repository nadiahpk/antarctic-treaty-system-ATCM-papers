Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area 127 Haswell Island (Haswell Island and Adjacent Emperor Penguin Rookery on Fast Ice)
Introduction

Haswell Island was originally designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 7 through Recommendation VIII-4 (1975) after a proposal by the USSR. 
Under Resolution 1 (1998), Russia was given responsibility for revising the Management Plan for SSSI 7, Haswell Island (redesignated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 127, Haswell Island, through Resolution V (1996)).
Field visits to the area during the 1999/2000 and 2003/2004 austral summer seasons allowed for the inventory and mapping of the avifauna, and for a more accurate definition of the boundaries of the Emperor penguin breeding colony on fast ice, adjacent to Haswell Island, which resulted in more precise definition of the ASPA boundaries. Recent studies confirm that the Area, a breeding site for almost all bird species in East Antarctica, is essential for fundamental research and monitoring of human impacts on the environment. Studies also reaffirm the originally designated values and their consistency with Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection.
The draft management plan was submitted to CEP VIII as Working Paper 15. It was agreed at CEP VIII that this draft management plan should be considered by the intersessional contact group (ICG) established to consider management plans.
In the process of considering the draft Management Plan by the ICG, useful comments were made by Great Britain and Australia, which were taken into account in the revised Management Plan of ASPA No. 127. The revised Management Plan is attached for CEP IX consideration.
