Proposed registration of the Landing Rock on the list of historical sites and monuments





Summary: 

		Resolution 4 of ATCM 2001 invited the Consultative Parties to revise the list of Antarctic Historical Sites and Monuments (HSM) in order to submit an updated document to CEP VI.
		During the preparation of its contribution, France noted that in the lists submitted previously (in Wellington in 1972 and in Brussels in 1985), no mention had been made of the rock upon which the French Dumont d’Urville Expedition landed and from which they took possession of Terre Adélie (January 21, 1840). This rock is aptly called the Landing Rock.
		France wishes to take advantage of the revision of the HSM list to correct this omission.




TERRE-ADELIE
Proposed addition of the Landing Rock on the list of historical sites and monuments

I – Proposal background
Three sites were suggested by France on the occasion of the ATCM (XIII – 16) Brussels 1985, i.e.: 
Port-Martin [46 (66°49’S / 141°23’E)]
Base Marret [47 (66°41’S / 141°01’E)]
Croix Prudhomme [48 (66°41’S / 141°01’E]
	A fourth one,
Cairn and plaque [27 (65°10’S / 64°09’W)]

To the Megalestris Hills, Petermann Island, Antarctic Peninsula, was jointly presented by Argentina, France and the United-Kingdom during the ATCM (VII-9) in Wellington 1972.
Resolution 4 (2001) on the Historical Sites and Monuments (HSM) invited the Consultative Parties to revise the list of HSM inside the Treaty zone. Finally, during XXVI ATCM, the United-Kingdom (DT-WP04) concluded it was necessary to update the list of SMH and volunteered to present this document at CEP VI. 
During the preparation of documents required for the requested update of above-named sites, we noted a major “omission”: the Landing Rock upon which landed officers and crew members of Dumont d’Urville’s ships.

II – History: reminder of events
A – Reminder:  1st part of the expedition

Having left Toulon on September 7, 1837 the ships Astrolabe and Zélée commanded by Dumont d’Urville and Jacquinot, respectively, had already done a first crossing during the year 1838. After passing the Clarence and Elephant Islands in the Southern Shetlands1, they started in January 1838 on the Weddell Sea, vainly attempting to reach the southern latitude this navigator had claimed as the southernmost part of his attempt. A second attempt having failed because of  excessive pack ice, Dumont d’Urville set towards the western coast of the Graham Land and discovered Joinville Island (which was in fact comprised of two islands2) and found a coast already described by Palmer and Bransfield which he named Louis-Philippe Land, and which in fact was the east coast of the Trinity Peninsula. On March 6, 1838, the expedition found itself at Deception Island and in May in Valparaiso.
	
B- Discovery of Terre Adelie
Having set sail again for Antarctica following his voyage to Oceania3, Dumont d’Urville this time came from the East. On January 20, 18404 he discovered a land mass which he named after his wife, Adèle.   On January 21, close to the Dumoulin5 Islands, each corvette lowered a launch6. The men, unable to disembark on the coast itself, set foot on an islet – “ on the westernmost highest west side of the islet7 ” - some five or six hundred meters away by 66°29’S and 138°21’ E 8, “ jumping ashore armed with picks and hammers ”. A tricolor flag was unfurled “ on these lands seen by no human eyes and trodden by no human foot before us. Following the ancient custom, as carefully observed by the English, we took possession of it in the name of France, as well as the nearby coast where ice prevented us from landing”. And further: “ The ceremony ended as it was bound to, with a libation. To the glory of France, foremost on our minds, we drank a bottle of one of its best wines, which one of our companions had had the foresight to bring along. Never had a Bordeaux wine served a higher role; never was a bottle emptied with such great purpose9”. 
Yet we needed to return with proof of our landing. Rock samples soon filled the bottom of our canoe10.
These rocks were then analyzed11. 
III – Registration of the landing rock on the list of historical sites […]
A- Eligibility
The site offered for registration meets upfront a number of registration conditions stipulated in 1995 ATCM Resolution 8, namely:
1 – Occurrence of an event of particular importance for the history of Antarctic science or exploration,
2 – Existence of a specific link with someone who played an important part in the history of Antarctic science or exploration,
4 – A representative fact of all or part of a major activity that enriched in-depth knowledge of Antarctica,
7 – A symbolic or commemorative value for the populations of many countries.

B- Geographical and geological reality of the landing spot.
While the recounting of Dumont d’Urville’s voyages left some uncertainties as to the exact position where the men came ashore, several authors, scientists and field workers were able to provide some further details, namely:
    1) That “ the map drawn “ under sail” by Vincendon-Dumoulin (…) and the officers of both corvettes is remarkably accurate” given the means of the time12. 
    2) That “ most points named by Dumont d’Urville could be identified (…). During a sojourn in the Pointe Géologie Archipelago in September 1951, we found the Landing Rock in the exact configuration and position13 described by Dubouzet”14 (Annex III).
    3) That the analysis of the geological samples brought back by Dumont d’Urville allows one to “declare that the landing took place on one of the islands found before Pointe Géologie. This fully confirms the E.P.F.’s interpretation 15”, i.e. Perroud’s16.
    4) That finally there is great similarity between the Rock as it appears on the print of the time (Annex VIIIb) and a photograph taken in 1961 (Annex VII).
