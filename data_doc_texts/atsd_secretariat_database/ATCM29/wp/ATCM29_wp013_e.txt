Non-native Species in the Antarctic
Report of a Workshop
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand

Introduction

At CEP VIII, Australia introduced Working Paper (ATCM XXVIII / WP 28) on Measures to address the unintentional introduction and spread of non-native biota and disease to the Antarctic Treaty Area.  Australia’s paper noted that no formal assessment had been undertaken of the risks associated with non-native species in the Antarctic context, and that increasing visitation and a changing, more benign, climate in certain parts of the Antarctic are likely to be increasing these risks.

The CEP discussed the issue in some detail and many members agreed that there were several matters of concern with regard to the broad issues of quarantine and the introduction of non-native species, which warranted further detailed consideration.

At CEP VIII New Zealand indicated that it would be prepared to host a workshop on these issues ahead of CEP IX, taking account of the matters raised by the Australian Working Paper (paras 129 – 144 of the Final Report of CEP VIII refer).

Workshop

The “Non-native Species in the Antarctic” Workshop was held 10 – 12 April 2006.  The Workshop was hosted by Gateway Antarctica at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.  The Workshop was co-convened by Dr Maj De Poorter (Centre for Biodiversity and Biosecurity, University of Auckland), Professor Bryan Storey (Director, Gateway Antarctica) and Dr Neil Gilbert (Antarctica New Zealand).

42 people attended the Workshop from six countries: Australia, France, Italy, New Zealand, UK and USA.

The aim of the workshop was to bring together relevant national and international experts to discuss conservation, management and research issues relating to the introduction of non-native species in the Antarctic, in order to foster increased understanding and awareness of:

    • the relevance of non-native species introductions to conservation of Antarctic environmental and other values;
    • pathways for intentional and unintentional introductions of non-native species;
    • best practice and management tools available (practical as well as legal);
    • identification of gaps (knowledge, methods, regulatory procedures);
    • requirements to address these gaps (including research, implementation, regulatory controls, awareness raising, etc).

Details about the workshop, including the programme, background material and administrative matters were made available through the CEP website.  The conveners are grateful to Australian Antarctic Division for their assistance in posting the information on the website.

The workshop presentations can be found on line via the Gateway Antarctica website www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz . Proceedings of the workshop will be published by the end of the year.

This Working Paper summarises the key findings of the workshop and sets out a number of recommendations for the CEP’s consideration.  The full version of the Workshop Report is provided as a separate Information Paper. 

Key findings of the workshop

The following issues arose as the primary points of concern from the workshop presentations and the discussion groups.

Definition of terms

To aid the discussions the following terms were used during the workshop:

    • Non-native species (sometimes called alien species): species that have been introduced to an ecosystem either intentionally or unintentionally.
        ◦ Introduction means the movement, as a direct or indirect result of human activity of species into an area where they are not native.
    • Transient alien species: species that have survived in small populations for a short period, but which have either died out naturally or have been removed by human intervention.
    • Persistent alien species:  species that have survived, established and reproduced for many years in a restricted locality, but which have not expanded their range from a specific location.
    • Invasive non-native species (sometimes called invasive alien species): non-native species whose introduction and/or spread threaten biological diversity.

General issues

    • Invasive alien species (IAS) are contributing significantly to a global biodiversity crisis.  For several groups, IAS represent the second or third major threat to their survival.
    • In the marine environment, IAS are recognised as the fifth biggest threat to global marine biodiversity.
    • Invasive alien species are found in all taxonomic groups, and all ecosystem types are at risk from the impacts of IAS.  Isolated and island ecosystems are particularly at risk due to the high degree of endemism found in such communities.
    • Ongoing increases in global trade and travel are causing an exponential increase in the movement of species outside of their natural range.

International regulatory measures

    • The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 1992, requires its Parties to “prevent the introduction of, control and eradicate alien species, which threaten local or regional biodiversity.”  Conferences of Parties to the CBD continue to press for more stringent measures to control invasive alien species at national, regional and global levels.  It was noted that, whilst the CBD is cast in global terms, the unique jurisdictional situation in Antarctica makes it difficult to directly apply it to the Treaty Area.
    • 
    • The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982 requires its Parties to control the transfer of species that may cause harmful change to marine communities. UNCLOS has application in the Southern Ocean and thus those Treaty Parties who are Parties to UNCLOS must implement its provision on non-native species.
    • The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) have adopted the Ballast Water Convention in 2004, which aims to “prevent, minimise and ultimately eliminate the risks …… arising from transfer of harmful aquatic organisms through the control and management of ships’ ballast water and sediments”
    • .  Once in force this will apply to vessels operating south of 60o South.
    • 
    • 
    • 

Response measures

    • Managing the issue requires a proactive approach and the need to assume that all species are guilty until proven innocent.
    • The principal components of any management programme are prevention, surveillance and response.
    • Prevention:  the most effective means of minimizing the impacts of IAS is to prevent their introduction in the first place.  Requires comprehensive controls and procedures to be in place.
    • Surveillance: can be passive (i.e. waiting for things to appear in the native environment) or targeted (i.e. an active programme of identifying potential alien species).  Requires good baseline data about what is already present in the native fauna and flora.
    • Response:  can include eradication or control.  The key factor will be to respond quickly and assess the feasibility, affordability and desirability of eradicating the alien species.  If eradication is not an option then control / confinement needs to be considered.

            ▪ To assist with the management of non-native species, a number of risk assessment tools are continuing to be developed.  However, such tools require adequate data and are likely to remain inadequate for data poor areas such as the Antarctic.
            ▪ No non-native species management programme can be 100% successful.  There is a need to focus on the key risks and pathways, to develop a coordinated approach and to ensure adequate research and monitoring is in place.

Invasive Alien Species in the Antarctic Context

            ▪ IAS have already significantly affected the sub-Antarctic islands, with around 200 known alien plants and animals established (Frenot et al 2005).  
            ▪ There is a strong correlation between introduced species and human activity on the sub-Antarctic islands with most alien species being of European origin.
            ▪ Introductions of non-native species into the Antarctic resulting from human activity far outweigh natural dispersal of species.
            ▪ Whilst Antarctica has natural environmental advantages (i.e. remoteness and a harsh climate), these are not enough to stop invasive species, pests and diseases.  There are several examples of non-native species occurring in Antarctica.  These include:

        ◦ Poa trivialis has survived several seasons in Antarctic soils near Syowa station (Japan 1996);
        ◦ Grasses have been observed in (and removed from) the Larseman Hills (Australia 1995);
        ◦ The North Atlantic spider crab Hyas araneus has been observed in samples taken from the northern Antarctic Peninsula region (Tavares and De Melo, 2004);
        ◦ Poa annua has survived several seasons in Antarctic soils and has increased in density around Arctowski station (Olech 1996).
        ◦ Several invertebrate species survived several seasons in discarded soils in the Schirmacher Oasis (Lewis Smith pers comm.);

    • Several marine species that are found in Antarctic waters (notably bryozoans and ascidians) are found elsewhere in the world.  It may not be appropriate to assume that marine species found in the Antarctic are native.
    • Increased human activity on the continent also risks transferring species across natural biogeographic boundaries with the subsequent breakdown of regional endemism, and genetic distinctness.  Antarctica is one of the few areas of the planet where such boundaries and regions still hold.  Two examples of high risk areas are:
    • Charcot Island has no springtails (an otherwise ubiquitous species) in its terrestrial ecosystem, which is scientifically highly significant.  The introduction of species to Charcot Island would compromise the scientific value of the island.
    • Ellsworth Land nunataks contain the simplest known multitrophic terrestrial ecosystems on the planet comprising only tardigrades and rotifers.  The potential for pre-adapted taxa to invade these systems is high with human activity in the region.
    • Increased human activity in the Antarctic also means increased ship and aircraft activity.
    • Aircraft pose particular risks by reducing the transport time for alien species from days or weeks to just a few hours (thus increasing the chances of transport survival)
    • Hull fouling of vessels is likely to be the most significant pathway for marine introductions to the Antarctic.
    • Increased links between Antarctica, the Arctic and the sub-Antarctic islands increases the potential for introductions of species having increased probability of survival.
    • A changing more benign climate, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula, is likely to increase the risks of alien species establishing themselves.

Research needs

    • There are significant gaps in our knowledge that will limit our ability to manage the issue in the Antarctic.  In the terrestrial environment our understanding is poor for most invertebrates and lower plants, and the microbial community.  In the marine environment our understanding of biodiversity and species distribution is extremely patchy.  
    • There is a pressing need for increased and coordinated survey, monitoring and research across the continent and Southern Ocean.
 
Existing Antarctic Regulatory Provisions

    • Article 4 of Annex II to the Protocol: 
    • prohibits the introduction of non-native species except in accordance with a permit;
    • places restrictions on what can be permitted;
    • provides an exemption for food;
    • requires that permitted species must be removed or destroyed; 
    • requires precautions to be taken to prevent the introduction of microorganisms not present in the native fauna and flora.

    • These provisions, however, are largely aimed at intentional introductions of non-native species.  The need for Parties to address the issue of unintentional introductions is not explicitly stated in the Protocol, though it can be inferred from a number of Articles (e.g. Article 3(2)(b)(iv)).
    • CCAMLR’s Article II requires its Parties to take account of the effects of introduction of alien species, though CCAMLR has yet to give the matter any attention.
    • The threshold for preventing introduced species in the Antarctic Treaty region should be considerably higher than elsewhere in the world due to the high environmental standards established through the Protocol.
 
Practical Measures

    • National Antarctic programmes have demonstrated a mixed response to the management of non-native species.  By way of example, Australian Antarctic Division and British Antarctic Survey have taken a proactive approach to the issue and have put in place a number of preventative procedures, which may prove useful for other operators.  
    • Marine pathways have yet to be adequately addressed by national programmes, though vessels travel to Antarctica from all over the globe.
    • To be effective, it will be important to ensure that practical measures are implemented consistently among all operators in the Antarctic.


Recommendations

On the basis of the presentations and the discussions at the Non-native Species Workshop, New Zealand offers the following recommendations for the CEP’s consideration.

Recommendation 1.  The issue of non-native species in the Antarctic should be given the highest priority consistent with the high environmental standards set out in the Protocol; a “zero tolerance” approach.

The Workshop agreed that the issue of invasive alien species requires priority attention in the Antarctic context.  The Workshop recognized that prevention is more effective than response once an invasive alien species has become established.  The potential loss of scientific, wilderness and other values set out in Article 3 of the Protocol, is too great to leave to chance.


Recommendation 2.  The CEP should take the lead on the issue and give consideration to placing the issue of non-native species as a separate item on its meeting agenda.

The issue of managing non-native species in the Antarctic requires significant and early attention.  The CEP is best placed to take the lead on the issue within the Antarctic Treaty System.


Recommendation 3.  The CEP should give consideration to sharing information with, seeking advice from, and coordinating action among other bodies, notably SCAR, CCAMLR, COMNAP, IAATO, IUCN and other organizations as appropriate (e.g. IMO).

The CEP is best placed to take the lead role on the issue.  But it will be essential to engage with other parts of the Antarctic Treaty System, observers and invited experts as appropriate.  IUCN, through its Invasive Species Specialist Group, has particular expertise to offer.


Recommendation 4.  Dedicated research is required to improve our understanding of, inter alia, existing biological and genetic diversity, species distributions, and biogeographic zones; the potential implications of a warming climate, and identification of high risk areas and ecosystems.  Particular research attention needs to be given to microbial communities and marine ecosystems.

The workshop recognized in particular the potential for SCAR’s Evolutionary Biology in Antarctica (EBA) programme http://www.nioo.knaw.nl/projects/scarlsssg/eba/ and the IPY circum-Antarctic Census of Marine Life programme www.caml.aq to contribute significantly to the research needs surrounding the issue.  

Recommendation 5.  To the extent possible, non-native species concerns should be built into existing procedures and practices; notably EIA procedures and the protected areas system.

An opportunity exists to better address non-native species concerns through the existing EIA procedures at all levels (i.e. preliminary assessments, IEEs and CEEs).  This may require further amendment of the CEP’s EIA Guidelines.  Consideration should also be given to utilizing protected area mechanisms to give appropriate (and even immediate) protection to high-risk sites.
 
Recommendation 6.  A set of comprehensive and standardised guidance and / or procedures should be developed, aimed at all operators in the Antarctic, based on a “Prevention, Surveillance, Response” approach.

Opportunities for immediate action by the CEP include:

    • Endorsement and dissemination of SCAR’s “Code of Conduct for Field Work: Transfer of Alien Species to Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands and Between Location Transfer of Species” developed through SCAR’s RiSCC programme;
    • Encourage and facilitate information sharing among national Antarctic programmes on existing practices and procedures, e.g. codes of conduct, inspection protocols etc. 
    • Establishment of a website for sharing information, listing species or locations at risk, listing potential or actual invasive species etc;
    • Producing an information pamphlet for visitors to Antarctica.
