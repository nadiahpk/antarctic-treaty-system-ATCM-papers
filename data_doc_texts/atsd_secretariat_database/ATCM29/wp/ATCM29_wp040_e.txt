Site Guidelines for Goudier Island, Port Lockroy

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom


Summary

1.  Goudier Island, Port Lockroy is the site of the historic British ‘Base A’, designated Historic Site and Monument no.61.  The UK has operated the base as a ‘living museum’ since 1996 and it is one of the most visited sites in Antarctica.  The UK manages all visits to the base.  

2.  Following the adoption of Site Guidelines, by Resolution 5(2005), the UK has prepared Site Guidelines for Goudier Island and recommends that the CEP submit these for adoption by the ATCM. 

Background

3. Goudier Island is located at 64°49’S, 63°29’W in Port Lockroy, Antarctic Peninsula.  It is a small island on which the historic British ‘Base A’, Port Lockroy, is located. This historic building, built in 1944, is owned by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, of which the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is a component body. 

4. Following a conservation survey by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UK AHT) in 1994, Port Lockroy was recognised for its historical importance and was adopted by means of Measure 4 (1995) as Historic Site and Monument No. 61 under the Antarctic Treaty. A conservation team undertook the renovation in 1996. Since then, it has been operated as a ‘living museum’ during the austral summer by a small BAS field party. Goudier Island has consistently been one of the most visited sites in Antarctica since the refurbishment in 1996. 

4. The attached Site Guidelines for Goudier Island are submitted in a format consistent with those submitted in ATCM XXIX/WP001.
