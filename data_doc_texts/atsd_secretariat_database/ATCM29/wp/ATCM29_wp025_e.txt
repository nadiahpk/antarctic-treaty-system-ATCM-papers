Construction and operation of the new Belgian Research Station in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. Draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE)
Introduction
A draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) has been carried out by Belgium for the Construction and operation of the new Belgian Research Station in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. It has been prepared to meet the requirements of Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the provisions of the Belgian Law in execution of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Official Journal 19 May 2005).
The draft CEE has been approved and endorsed by the Belgian Federal Ministries of Environment, Foreign Affairs and Science Policy. It was released by the Belgian Federal Science Policy (Belspo) on 10 February 2006 and notification of the report was sent to all Parties to the Protocol on Environmental Protection via diplomatic channels. The CEP Chair was notified that the Draft CEE had been circulated.
This Working Paper describes briefly the location, scientific goals, construction and design concept, and the potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the new Belgian research station.
The complete draft CEE has been submitted as an Information Paper and can also be downloaded as a PDF from the Belspo website (http://www.belspo.be/antar). In addition, Belspo will make available CDs and colour printed copies of the draft CEE report at ATCM XXIX.

The Project
Purpose
The new Belgian research station (71°57’S 023°20’E) will be established during the IPY and will replace the former Belgian Roi Baudouin base, built in 1958 on the ice shelf at Breid Bay in Dronning Maud Land and closed in 1967 buried under meters of snow.
The station will be situated near the Utsteinen Nunatak, at the foot of the Sør Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, 173 km inland from the former Roi Baudouin base and 55 km from the former Japanese Asuka station (1986-1992). Positioned halfway between the Japanese Syowa station (684 km) and the Russian Novolazarevskaya station (431 km) it will fill in a 1072 km unoccupied stretch between these two stations in one of the least occupied sectors of Antarctica that has only been intermittently investigated since the International Geophysical Year (IGY).  
The station will have access to all characteristic geographical regions (polynia, coast, ice shelf, ice sheet, marginal mountain area and dry valleys, inland plateau) within a radius of 200 km and will therefore occupy a central position for carrying out research and monitoring activities in these areas.
The New Belgian Research Station will serve:
    • as a hub for field exploration in the 20-30 degrees East sector of Antarctica
    • as a node in the network of geophysical observatories
    • as a monitor of environmental change in Antarctica
    • as a tool for education and outreach
With this IPY initiative Belgium wants to offer to the Belgian and international scientific community a flexible platform for science and exploration, where research will be able to adapt not only to the evolution of science and technology but also to increased environmental concern.

Challenging project
General characteristics:
    • Austral summer station: open from November to February.
    • Full-year monitoring and remote sensing capability.
    • The station is designed for optimal use by 12 people accommodated in the main building. 
    • The use of a station “extension” will make it possible to accommodate another 8 to 18 people.  This extension consists of heated shelters used for sleeping only.
    • The station’s facilities (kitchen, sanitary installations and offices) are designed to cope with the larger occupation as mentioned above.
    • Total building surface (living, technical, research, storage): 800 m².
    • There will be laboratory facilities as well as mobile units to be used for field work
    • Low environmental footprint design based on sustainable technology and high energy efficiency.
    • Expected design life: 25 years minimum.
The station concept is unique in several ways:
Situated on a small exposed rock surface completely surrounded by snow (so called ‘island’ position), the station will have a hybrid design exploiting maximally the on-site potential. The main building will be anchored on the snow-free granitic ridge and connected by a weather protected corridor to the garage/storage building constructed under the adjacent snow surface.
Without neglecting important design drivers as safety, health, comfort, functionality and costs, the design of the station is based on sustainable technology and high energy efficiency. The facilities will use renewable energy as the primary energy source, thereby minimising the use of fossil fuels. The amount of fuel to be transported to the station will therefore be mainly used for transport and field work. The station will have a comprehensive waste management and treatment regime, including the treatment of grey and black water and recycling capability for non-potable water applications.
The main building has a concentric architecture laid out around a "hot technical core". All temperature-sensitive installations and equipment, such as the waste water treatment system, are concentrated in this area of the building. Second and third concentric layers will contain respectively the active and passive living spaces. The core-based architecture allows a “feed-through-the-wall” concept for water supply, drainage and other services resulting in compactness and a high level of system integration. When closed down for winter each individual layer will be "sealed" thereby creating a number of temperature-controlled buffer zones against the cold exterior environment.
By design the station has extended upgrade capability and it could be upgraded to a full year station with minimal effort. Although designed as a summer station only, there will be year round power supply to maintain the building inside temperature under control and in the mean time allowing year round monitoring. It will be easy to integrate new state of the art technologies. The station is also designed so that it can be easily decommissioned, disassembled and removed from Antarctica

Alternatives
Several possible construction sites were identified but all except Utsteinen Nunatak were rejected because they had no scientific, operational or environmental benefits.
Within the design constraints, several station options were considered; each option was evaluated for environmental effect, logistic implications for construction and operation, decommissioning and ability to meet the planned scientific programme. Aerodynamic tests were used in the final choice to determine which design had the least effect on snow accumulation and wind erosion, consistent with operating and maintaining the station.

Initial environmental reference state of the Sør Rondane
The new station will be situated at an altitude of 1397 m on Utsteinen Ridge, approximately 200 km inland from Breid Bay. The area has been briefly visited by Belgian (1958-1967) and later by Japanese (1987-1991) field expeditions and more recently in 2004 and 2005 by Belgian site survey expeditions in preparation for the new station. Although the Utsteinen area itself is pristine, a small number of depots and litter can be found elsewhere in the Sør Rondane, left by field parties during the pre-Madrid Protocol period.
The whole area around the Utsteinen Ridge is stable and hardly influenced by the overall ice sheet motion. Snow accumulation rates around the site vary from -9 cm/year (ablation) to + 45 cm/year (accumulation). Displacement rates vary from 5 to 26 cm/year. 
The site is characterised by a relative mild climate, considering its altitude and distance from the coast: the average annual temperature is -18°C, varying between -8°C in December and -25°C in September, while relatively low wind speeds (mean wind speed of 6 m/s) are due to the protective effect at the West side of the mountain range. The yearly variation of the climatic elements on the other hand points towards the continental character of the climate. 
A baseline study was performed on soil, snow/ice and lichen samples taken from the Utsteinen Ridge during the Belare 2004 and Belare 2005 site survey expeditions. Sample results show that the Utsteinen site is indeed pristine, with no indication of previous human impact. 
Biological research studies conducted in the Sør Rondane area are limited in number and studies at the construction site are non-existent. Only a few Lichens were found on Utsteinen Ridge, however, they are quite abundant on the Nunatak itself. The vertebrate fauna in the vicinity of the station consists of birds only: snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) and Antarctic skua (Catharacta maccormicki). During the over-land survey of the coast and access route to Utsteinen (Belare 2005), a breeding colony of Weddell seals was spotted at Breid Bay, the future unloading site for construction and yearly provisioning. There were no observations of Penguin rookeries at Breid Bay, neither during all the working years of the Roi Baudouin base nor during the recent Belare 2005 expedition. At the construction site, no invertebrates were recorded, but they may possibly be found near the small snow petrel breeding site at Utsteinen Nunatak.
There are no Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed areas (ASPAs or ASMAs) or Historic Sites and Monuments in the region of the proposed Belgium Station.
The ice shelves of Prinsesse Ragnhild Kyst, where unloading of construction materials will take place, are an active ice front that continually refreshes itself.

Impact assessment and mitigation measures
The CEE has identified and evaluated potential environmental impacts that may be generated during construction and operation of the station:
    • atmospheric emissions from combustion of fossil fuels from shipping, aircraft and running of snow vehicles, generators and stoves;
    • fuel spills from aircraft and vehicle fuelling;
    • grey water and waste discharges from shipping, station functioning and scientific activities;
    • noise from shipping, aircraft and running of snow vehicles, generators and wind turbines; and
    • physical disturbance from the station functioning and scientific activities.

All of these will occur locally within the construction and operation area.

Of these impacts the most significant are atmospheric emissions, fuel spills and grey water and waste discharge.

The station has been designed for minimum energy requirement and maximum use of renewable resources. The fossil fuel requirement for operation of the station will, therefore, be kept as low as possible. There may be greater fossil fuel requirements during the construction phase until the station becomes operational. Standard procedures will be developed for the transport, handling, transfer and use of fuels. Due to its ‘Island’ position and the remarkable constant wind direction, fall out from emission products at the station will be dispersed away from the exposed rock of the nunatak and mountain areas.
The station has also been designed to minimise generation of grey water with a further objective of no grey water output. It is accepted, however, that during construction and initial operation there may be some grey water discharge. All grey water will be filtered at the station before disposal to remove solid material. Due to the limited ice movement in the area, discharged grey water is unlikely to be transported to other areas. A Waste Management Plan will be prepared to document the procedures for the collection, storage, reduction, recycling and disposal of solid wastes.
The sustainability concept of the station will in general assure a low environmental footprint with minimal waste output.
Monitoring and verification
Baseline data were collected during the Belare 2004 and 2005 site survey expeditions, in order to obtain reliable information about the initial clean state of the environment and to establish the “footprint” of the station.
An environmental monitoring program will be developed to investigate the potential impacts of the activity, so that adverse effects will be discovered in good time, allowing for modification of the activity to remove or reduce the impact. Information on the operation of the station will also be recorded for monitoring purposes. This includes fuel consumption data, fuel spills, station population, waste generation, waste disposal routes etc.

Gaps in knowledge and uncertainties
The major gaps and uncertainties in the assessment of the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the Belgian research station are:
    • Unpredictability of sea ice extent at Breid Bay and local weather conditions during construction of the station. This may lead to delay in completion of construction.
    • Exact ice conditions at the unloading site.
    • Incomplete details of final station design.
    • Incomplete details of logistic operations for the construction of the station, i.e. ship and aircraft availability.
    • Location of breeding species in a 200 km range: birds, penguins, seals.
    • Changes in future scientific and logistic activities.

Conclusion
The Belgian Federal Ministries of Environment, Foreign Affairs and Science Policy concluded that the global scientific importance and value to be gained by the construction and operation of the new Belgian station in the 1072 km empty sector between the Japanese Syowa station and the Russian Novolazarevskaya station outweighs the more than minor and transitory impacts the station construction and operation will have on the Antarctic environment and fully justifies the launch of this project.
Belgium considers its decision to reconstruct a new research station in Antarctica in line with its position as one of the original signatories of the Antarctic Treaty. The “Do not go” alternative is considered as opposed to the philosophy of growing importance of Antarctica’s key role in Global Change and increased concern of the state of its environment.
