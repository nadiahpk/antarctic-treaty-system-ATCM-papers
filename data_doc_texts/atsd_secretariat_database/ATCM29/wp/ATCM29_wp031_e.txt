Review of Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA)
Nos. 116 and 131

Working Paper submitted by New Zealand


Introduction
In accordance with the provisions of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Resolution 1 (1998), New Zealand has initiated a review of the management plans for the following Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs):
    • ASPA 116, New College Valley, Cape Bird, Ross Island
    • ASPA 131, Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Victoria Land
The review processes for two of the ASPAs (116 and 131) have been completed and are described in this paper.  Draft revised plans for these Areas are annexed.   It is proposed, subject to the views of the Committee, that these updated Management Plans be approved during ATCM XXIX, without further intersessional review.

ASPA 116, Caughley Beach, Cape Bird, Ross Island
Introduction
An area containing some of the richest stands of moss and associated microflora and fauna on Ross Island was designated as SSSI No. 10 Caughley Beach (Recommendation XIII-8) and SPA No. 20 New College Valley (Recommendation XIII-12) in 1985.  In 2000 the Management Plans were revised and the two sites consolidated into a single Area with a restricted zone.  A five-year review was initiated in 2002/2003 with a site inspection and surveying by the Antarctica New Zealand environmental team.  In 2003 safety concerns were raised by Helicopters New Zealand about the current helipad and further investigation into these concerns were initiated.  A proposed new helipad site was identified at Cape Bird, which lies within the current ASPA boundaries. Discussions continue about this proposed helipad some of which are incorporated into this working paper.  Areas of richer vegetation have been found in the Ross Sea region since the designation of this Area but essentially the values for which ASPA 16 was originally designated remain unchanged and are unique to Ross Island.  
Review of Activities
In the period since the last review of the management plan for ASPA 116, the United States has issued two permits and New Zealand has issued five permits for entry to the Area.  Activity conducted in the Area has been largely based around monitoring and surveying.  Two events were permitted to enter the Area to conduct photo monitoring of the effects that large icebergs have had on the nearby penguin colonies.  
It has also become apparent that personnel staying the nearby New Zealand field hut have been inadvertently entering the ASPA when collecting snow (for water) from a nearby gully.  The Management Plan has no provision for entry for water collecting purposes. 
Consultation with Community 
New Zealand researchers known to have worked in the Area since its designation, researchers working around the Area and helicopter pilots were contacted to gauge whether information in the management plan was still relevant and were asked to comment on a proposed new helipad that would lie just within the current ASPA boundary.  

Discussion points
Proposed Helicopter Pad
The current helicopter landing site on Caughley Beach present operational concerns at certain times of the season.  As a result attempts have been made to identify alternative landing sites in the area.  The most likely option for a new helipad would lie just inside the northern boundary of the ASPA, and was proposed because it is a flat area with no moss and it affords pilots a better view of the site before landing.  However, to use this helipad option, the northern boundary of the ASPA would have to be moved back to at least its original northern boundary.  Consultation raised comments and concerns from within both the research and logistics communities:
Operational matters
    • The current helipad on the beach to the south of the hut is fine in the early part of the season when the usual approach is over the sea ice.
    • Resupply flights land near the hut at the beginning of the season as it is before the penguins arrive.  
    • Main difficulty arises between November and February when numerous birds transit between the sea ice and colony.
    • When the sea ice breaks out, helicopter operations to and from the helipad become much more restricted due to limitations of open water and accompanying north/south approach and departure flights along the beach.  Arrival and departures are then made from Inclusion Hill along the edge of the cliff to position abeam the helipad.  
    • The current helipad at Cape Bird is one of the most difficult landing places for helicopters operating in this area because of the steep approach.  
    • The colonies appear to be growing and even the accepted helipad often has penguins by it.  

Vegetation
    • A vegetation survey was conducted within ASPA 116 in 2005/06 (Map C).  While there may be other areas supporting moss vegetation at Cape Bird, mapping research shows that the area outlined in Map C is the most extensive in the region, i.e. the Cape Bird ice-free region as a whole.   
    • The values protected by ASPA 116 remain unchanged.  
    • To move the boundary would mean that a large section of the melt water catchment containing moss would be outside the ASPA boundary and therefore the largest moss flush would only be partially protected.
    • The location of the proposed helipad is in close proximity to the moss stands and therefore scree and dust from the helicopter down blast would be blown over the moss stands and could irreparably damage them.  In addition, the moss probably exists in such large stands because of the sheltered nature of the site.  Under normal dry conditions, the moss is dry and particularly vulnerable to wind disturbance from helicopters.   
Penguins
    • To land and depart from the proposed helipad would mean that helicopters would have to overfly penguins in the sub-colonies on the ridge to the north and also the southern most sub-colonies of the northern colony on the beach.
    • Find an approach whereby the penguins cannot see the helicopter as they are more disturbed by the sight of the helicopter as opposed to the noise. 

No resolution to these various issues has yet been found, but it was agreed not to hold up the revision and update of the management plan.  As such no boundary changes are proposed at this stage. 

Proposed Revision
The Management Plan text has been modified.  The major changes include:

Section 3. Management Activities
Added:
    • Up to date Management Plans, maps and other relevant information shall be made available on National Programme websites.

Section 5. Maps and Photographs
    • Map B has vegetation, streams, penguin distribution, helicopter landing pad by the hut, walking tracks, toilet and stores hut, and ASPA sign added to it.    
    • Added - Map C.  Site Topographic Map – Enlargement.   

Section 6. Description of Area
Deleted: 
    • (formally Bryum antarcticum) 
    • (formally Bryum argenteum)

6 (iii) – added description of location of toilet and hut store.


Proposed ongoing Management Measures of the Area

In addition to the changes made to the management plan, the following management measures and actions will also be undertaken.
    • Move the ASPA sign to the northwest corner of the ASPA at the beginning of the season. 
    • Install a marker at the top of the water collection gully to indicate the ASPA boundary.
    • Further investigation of ASPA 116 including the restricted area to produce a more detailed vegetation map of the Area.  
    • Further investigation into an alternative helipad site elsewhere at Cape Bird, e.g. Priapus Point.  
    • Further investigation into moving the Cape Bird hut to another area e.g. Shell Glacier.
    • Investigation into moving the toilet and stores hut to the north side of the main hut, thus freeing up a large area for helicopter landing which may be used throughout the season.  
    • Installation of a visible marker on Inclusion Hill and also on the hut (a small orange wind sock) to help helicopter pilots navigate their way.

ASPA 131, Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Victoria Land
Introduction
An area containing some of the richest vegetation in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region known as Canada Glacier flush was designated as SSSI 12 in 1985 (Resolution XIII-8).  The plan was revised into Annex V format in 1997.  A five-year review was initiated in January 2003 and a vegetation density survey was conducted in 2005/06 season.  The values of the site, namely rich bryophyte and algal growth and its interest to science, remain unchanged.  
Review of Activities
In the period since the last revision of the management plan for ASPA 131, the United States as issued three permits to enter the Area and New Zealand has issued thirteen.  An inadvertent un-permitted entry was made by New Zealand arts and education visitors (3 personnel total) in 2002/03.  Action to prevent any such recurrence was taken by Antarctica New Zealand.  Activity in the Area has been varied and has included research on flora and invertebrates, environmental monitoring and ongoing continuous recording of a stream gauge.  
Consultation with Science Community
New Zealand researchers known to have worked in the Area since its designation were contacted to gauge whether information in the management plan was still current and whether the values identified had changed since the last revision.  The values of the Area were considered more than sufficient to warrant continued protection.  
Proposed Revision
The Management Plan text has been modified.
The major changes include:
Section 3. Management activities
Added:
    • up to date Management Plans, maps and other relevant information shall be made available on National Programme websites.

Section 5.  Maps and Photographs.
    • Map B and D from the Management Plan have been deleted.  The old Map C has become Map B and a new map - a topographic vegetation density map has become Map C.    

Section 6. Description to Area
Added:
    • Subtitles added – General description, Boundaries, Biology, Past Human Activity.
    • The boundary description in this section has been re-ordered as one would walk it.  
    • Section 6(i), para 4, line 8 now includes Prasiola calophylla, which occurs in dense ribbons on the underside of stones.  
    • Text from 6(iii) has been moved to the Past Human Activity section.

Section 7.  Permit Conditions
Changed numbers to bullet points in Section 7 (ix).
Proposed ongoing Management Measures of the Area

    • Sites of past damage need clear marking and recording so they are known to future researchers and systematic monitoring of their recovery can be undertaken.  
    • An assessment should be undertaken as to whether there are other glacier snouts with wetland communities which should also be protected, or which should be managed in a collective manner with this one.  This will be investigated in the context of the designation of ASMA 2, McMurdo Dry Valleys.  
    • Install a boundary marker in the north-eastern corner of the boundary.  
    • Part of the boundary follows the glacier wall – this is dynamic and needs to be resurveyed.

A bibliography of relevant literature (see below) has also been added to the management plan.
