The work of CCAMLR on Marine Protected Areas




THE WORK OF CCAMLR ON MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
(CCAMLR Secretariat)

    1) In 2004, CCAMLR addressed the topic on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and urged its Scientific Committee to proceed with this work as a matter of priority.  The Commission reaffirmed the need to develop advice on MPAs which was commensurate with Articles II and IX of the CAMLR Convention (CCAMLR-XXIII, paragraph 4.13).
    2) The CCAMLR Workshop on Marine Protected Areas was held in August 2006.  The Workshop report is attached.
    3) Following the workshop, CCAMLR has agreed that there is a need to develop a strategic approach and harmonized regime to protect the Antarctic marine environment across the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS).  It has also recognized that this may require some clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the ATCM and CCAMLR in managing different kinds of human activity in the region.  This requires good collaboration at both technical and policy levels, particularly in develop further the MPA concept for the Southern Ocean as a whole.  Therefore, CCAMLR has recognized the need for extensive dialogue with key elements of the Treaty System (CEP and the ATCM) as well as SCAR, SCOR and other inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations (CCAMLR-XXIV, paragraphs 4.12 and 4.13).
    4) CCAMLR recognized that (CCAMLR-XXIV, paragraph 4.14):
    • MPAs exhibit considerable potential for furthering the Convention’s objectives in terms of providing protection for ecosystem processes, habitats and biodiversity as well as in protecting particular species (including specific populations and/or life history stages);
    • Under IUCN categorization, the CAMLR Convention Area qualifies as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area), being a protected area managed primarily for conservation through management intervention to ensure habitat maintenance and/or to meet the requirements of particular species;
    • Conservation outcomes consistent with the objectives of CAMLR Convention Article II not only include maintaining biological diversity, but also the maintenance of ecosystem processes;
    • Consideration should be given to the need, inter alia, to protect representative areas, scientific areas and areas potentially vulnerable to human impacts in order to mitigate such impacts and/or to ensure marine living resource sustainability consistent with the rational use provisions of CAMLR Convention Article II, and
    • The process of establishing a CCAMLR protected areas system also needs to account for satisfactory fishery outcomes consistent with the rational use provisions of Article II.
    5) CCAMLR noted that the types of scientific information necessary to develop MPAs require (CCAMLR-XXIV, paragraph 4.15):
    • Consideration of various key tasks in developing a system of protected areas to assist CCAMLR in achieving its broader conservation objectives.  Such tasks comprise:
    • Broad-scale bio-regionalization of the Southern Ocean;
    • Fine-scale subdivision of bio-geographic provinces, which may include spatial characteristic hierarchies and features within regions, with particular attention be given to areas identified in bio-regionalization;
    • Identification of areas that might be used to achieve conservation objectives, and
    • Determination of areas requiring interim protection;




    • Such tasks should initially comprise a desktop study;
    • The types of data required have been listed by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee.
    6) CCAMLR therefore identified a work plan for developing a system of marine protected areas (CCAMLR-XXIV, paragraph 4.17), including: 
    • Holding another workshop to advise on bio-regionalization of the Southern Ocean, including, where possible, advice on small-scale delineation of provinces and potential areas for protection to further CCAMLR’s conservation objectives;
    • Establishing a Steering Committee with representation from both SC-CAMLR and the CEP.  An important task of this Steering Committee will be to involve appropriate experts from outside SC‑CAMLR and the CEP that possess relevant data or expertise, and
    • Inviting the CEP to initiate the work necessary to develop bio-regionalization of the coastal provinces, as an extension of its terrestrial bio-regionalization work, while SC-CAMLR undertakes initial work to delineate oceanic provinces.
    7) The outcomes of the above work will be the focus of a second CCAMLR MPA Workshop in 2007.
    8) The MPA Workshop Steering Committee has been established by CCAMLR in April 2006.
