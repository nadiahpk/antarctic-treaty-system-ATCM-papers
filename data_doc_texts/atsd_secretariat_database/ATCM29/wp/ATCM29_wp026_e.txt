Introduction
Admiralty Bay is an area of outstanding environmental, historical, scientific, and aesthetic values.  It was first visited by sealers and whalers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and relics from these periods still remain. The area is characterized by magnificent glaciated mountainous landscape, varied geological features, rich sea-bird and mammal breeding grounds, diverse marine ecosystems, and terrestrial plant habitats. Scientific research in Admiralty Bay in post IGY times has been performed in a more permanent way for some three decades now. The studies on penguins have been undertaken continuously in the area for 28 years, and is the longest ever done in Antarctica. Admiralty Bay also has one of the longest historical series of meteorological data collected for the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the areas of the planet most sensitive to climate change.
Admiralty Bay has become a site of increasingly diverse human activities, which are continuously growing and becoming more complex. Along the last 30 years, more stations were settled and have grown in area, and visitors increased in numbers per year, from a few hundreds to over 3000. Better planning and co-ordination of existing and future activities will help to avoid or to reduce the risk of mutual interference and minimize environmental impacts, thus providing an effective mechanism for the conservation of the valuable features that characterize the area.
Five parties: Poland, Brazil, United States, Perú and Ecuador have active research programmes in the area. Poland and Brazil operate two all-year round stations (Poland: Henryk Arctowski Station at Thomas Point; and Brazil: Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station at Keller Peninsula). Perú and United States operate two summer stations (Perú: Machu Picchu at Crepin Point; USA: Copacabana at Llano Point). Ecuador has a refuge at Hennequin  Point. There are several small removable and permanent installations elsewhere. 
The Area includes one ASPA (ASPA Nº 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay – former SSSI Nº 8) and one Historic Monument (N° 51: a grave) at Arctowski Station.
In addition to numerous scientists, supporting personnel and research expeditions, Admiralty Bay is visited by an increasing number of tourists, the latter mainly as organized tourist ship expeditions and private yachts.
A Management Plan for designating Admiralty Bay and its surroundings (herein called the Area) as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), under Annex V of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection (herein called Protocol), was jointly proposed by Brazil and Poland, in coordination with Ecuador and Perú and voluntarily adopted by the ATCPs at ATCM XX (Utrecht, 1996).   The document presented here is a revision of the former Management Plan, as required at ATCM XX.
1.0  Description of values

    • Aesthetic values

Admiralty Bay has basic physiographic and aesthetic values as one of the most typical examples of bay/fjord settings in the South Shetland Islands. The ice-free areas within Admiralty Bay are formed by recent and raised pebble-cobble beaches, recent and sub-recent moraines, mountainous peninsulas, rocky islets, spurs and nunataks. The terrain is heavily shaped by glacial, nival and coastal marine processes. These, together with the geological features of the area, add  to the great scenic beauty of the landscape.
    • Environmental values
The area of Admiralty Bay is representative of the terrestrial, limnic, coastal, near-shore, pelagic, and fjord-bottom ecosystem of King George Island.
Flora is mostly represented by mosses, lichen and fungi formations.  Twenty four species of birds and six species of pinnipeds have been registered for the Area., but only thirteen species of birds and three species of pinnipeds actually breed within the Area. 
The marine ecosystem of the bay largely reflects the general environmental conditions prevailing in the South Shetland Islands.  However, there is a unique site, Napier Rock, at the entrance of the bay, where a rich and highly diverse benthic invertebrate fauna is found.  Fish are represented by fifteen species of Nototheniidae.
    • Scientific values
Diverse and continuous scientific activities have been undertaken in the Area for almost 30 years supported by the Polish Henryk Arctowski Station, by the Brazilian Comandante Ferraz Station and by the US Antarctic Program at ASPA Nº 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay. Research activities at the Peruvian Machu Picchu Station (at Crepin Point) and at the Ecuadorian refuge (at Hennequin Point) have occurred intermittently during the summer. 

Many features of Admiralty Bay are of considerable scientific interest. The main themes of field and laboratory research at the Polish and Brazilian stations have been marine and terrestrial biology, including physiology and adaptation of Antarctic fish and krill; taxonomy and ecology of the benthic fauna; vascular plants; mosses and lichens; terrestrial and marine ecology; migration and dispersion of birds. A long-term research project on the biology and dynamics of bird populations (mainly Pygoscelid penguins) has been carried out by the US Antarctic Program since 1976. This study is of relevance for the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP). Other studies include geology and palaeontology, glaciology and palaeoclimatology of the King George Island ice cap; and glacio-marine sedimentation in Admiralty Bay. A year-round seismic and Earth-magnetism observatory, established at Arctowski Station in 1978, is the only station of its kind in the South Shetland Islands.  Studies on atmospheric chemistry, geomagnetism, the ionosphere and astrophysics have been conducted at Ferraz Station since 1984. A meteorological station has been operational at Arctowski since 1977 and at Ferraz Station since 1984 to provide basic data and to support logistic operations.  Research on upper atmosphere winds is being developed at Machu Picchu Station using MST radar.  
Both Arctowski and Ferraz stations have hosted many foreign scientists (Argentineans, Belgians, Chileans, Germans, former Soviets and Russians, Netherlands, New Zealanders, Americans, Uruguayans and others). There is a strong tradition of co-operation between Polish and Brazilian scientists in matters related to Admiralty Bay and the South Shetland Islands as a whole.
A comprehensive study of the state of the environment in the Area is under way at Ferraz Station, comprising the analysis of a series of biotic and abiotic parameters. Results will serve as a base-line for future monitoring of activities and for implementation of a strategy for environmental management of the ASMA.
    • Historic values
Sheltered deep harbours and accessible beaches ensured an early start to activities in Admiralty Bay. The bay offered protection for ships in the area during the sealing and whaling periods in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and ruins of installations related to the latter period still exist.   Whale bones cover the beaches and are part of the landscape, remaining as heritage of this period.

The Area was visited by the second French Antarctic Expedition Pourquoi Pas?, under Dr J B Charcot (1908-10), and by D Ferguson (1913-14), a geologist who took part in a British whaling expedition. Reports on minerals and rocks collected during these expeditions, published between 1910 and 1921, are among the first earth-science publications on Admiralty Bay and the South Shetland Islands as a whole. The famous British Discovery voyages of 1934 and 1937 collected more rocks, as well as plants and animals from the Area Results published from 1948 to 1964 constituted  a substantial contribution to knowledge of the geology of Admiralty Bay. Argentina established a refuge hut at Keller Peninsula in 1948 (since dismantled) and the work of Argentinean geologists in Admiralty Bay in 1953 concentrated on  fossil plants of the Tertiary age.
During the International Geophysical Year (1957-58), the UK Base "G", on Keller Peninsula, Admiralty Bay (opened in 1947 and closed in 1961), later dismantled, was the center of meteorological observations and glaciological and geological research. 
Establishment of the Polish Arctowski Station in 1977 at Thomas Point, of the Brazilian Ferraz Station at Keller Peninsula in 1984, and of the Peruvian Machu Picchu Station at Crepin Point in 1989 has provided a sound basis for permanent research in Biological, Earth and Atmospheric sciences, which continues up to now.  Ornithological research by US biologists began in 1976, with the establishment of Copacabana Station (unofficially called Pietr J. Lenie) covering the entire western side of Admiralty Bay, from Italian Valley (in Ezcurra Inlet) to Patelnia Point. Since 1985, ornithological research has also been occasionally undertaken at Keller Peninsula, by Brazilian biologists.
    • Educational and touristic values
Sites of ecological interest and scientific installations in the Area are frequently visited by tourists and participants in non-governmental expeditions, who have thus an opportunity to become familiar with Antarctic environment and activities.
2.0 Aims and Objectives
Taking into account that the Area is already the locus of multiple and continuous activities which  tend to become even more intense and diverse in the near future, the present Management Plan is designed to provide mechanisms for:
    • Safeguarding the long-term scientific research in the Area while maintaining stewardship of the environment;
    • Protecting important physiographic features, and the outstanding biological, ecological, historical and aesthetic values of the Area;
    • Improving the understanding of natural processes at work in the Area which in turn will help to protect the environment from unnecessary disturbance;
    • Managing potential or actual conflicts of interest between different activities, including science, logistics and tourism;
    • Avoiding or minimizing the risk of mutual interference and cumulative impacts on the terrestrial and marine environments; and 
    • Improving the level of mutual assistance and co-operation among Parties operating in the Area.
3.0  Management Activities
The following management activities should be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • Parties that have active research programmes within the Area should establish an international Admiralty Bay Management Group, which will hold regular meetings (at a convenient time) to: 
        ◦ review the functioning and implementation of the Management Plan;
        ◦ facilitate communication between those working in or visiting the Area;
        ◦ monitor the Area to investigate possible sources of environment impact including cumulative impacts;
        ◦ promote the dissemination of information on this Management Plan to all parties operating in the Area, and all other visitors to the Area;
        ◦ maintain a record of activities in the Area;
        ◦ provide the name and address of their co-ordinator.
    • Parties that have active research programmes within the Area should consult amongst themselves with a view to:
        ◦ designating a person to coordinate the implementation of the Management Plan in the Area (ASMA Coordinator). Designation will be for a 5 year period on a rotational basis.
        ◦ developing contingency plans for each station, as well as for the whole Area, for oil spills and any other accident with possible significant impact on the environment, including attendance in an emergency;
        ◦ establishing a waste management plan for the Area.
    • National Programmes operating within the Area, as well as all other visitors, should undertake activities in accordance with the environmental Code of Conduct  contained in this Management Plan.
    • Wherever feasible, markers delimiting boundaries of already existing protected areas and                other zones of ecological or scientific interest identified in this Management Plan and warnings for visitors about their nature should be provided, and removed when no longer necessary.  
    • National Programmes that have active research programmes in the Area should make arrangements with other parties that have installations and/ or structures now abandoned to consider their value. Conservation plans should be formulated if any of the installations are assessed to be of historical value. If not, plans should be formulated for their removal in accordance with the provisions of Annex III on Waste Disposal and Waste Management to the Protocol on Environmental  Protection. 
    • National Programmes operating in the Area should ensure that all personnel in their programmes visiting the Area have been briefed on the requirements of the Management Plan and, in particular, on the Environmental Code of Conduct that applies within the Area. 
    • Tour operators visiting the Area should ensure that their staff, crew and passengers are briefed on, and are aware of the requirements of this Management Plan and supporting documentation.  
    • Copies of this management plan and supporting documentation, such as maps and appendices, should be kept in appropriate stations and research hut facilities and be made available to all persons in the Area.   
4.0  Period of Designation
Designated for an indefinite period.
5.0  Description of the Area
5. 1  Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features
General description. The proposed ASMA of Admiralty Bay (62º 01´21´´S – 62º14´09´´S/
58º 15´05´´W– 58º41´02´´W ) comprises the terrestrial and marine areas immediately within the glacial drainage basin of this bay (Fig. 2). In addition, it includes ASPA Nº 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, part of which is outside the drainage basin area.
The Area is bounded by a line extending from its southern margin at Telefon Point  to The Tower, and then toward Jardine Peak intersecting the ice divide of the Warszawa ice-field, thence following this divide to the west of Ezucurra Inlet, north-eastward to enclose Mackellar and Martel inlets, and then southward through Ternyck Needle to Cape Syrezol on the eastern shore of, Admiralty Bay. The waters of Admiralty Bay and a small part of Bransfield Strait north of a straight line between Cape Syrezol and Telefon Point are also included in the ASMA. There are no fixed survey points available at the Area boundaries, but markers indicating the ASMA will be fixed at appropriate arrival points on land.	
The revised total area of the proposed ASMA is 360 km², of which 194 km² are ice covered, including 138 km² of Admiralty Bay Waters and an adjoining 7 km2 of the Bransfield Strait (Admiralty Chart N° 6258, 1968, London; Polish Chart Admiralty Bay, King George Island, 1:50,000, Battke, S, Warszawa, 1990; Site of Special Scientific Interest No.8 (SSSI no.8), King George Island, 1:12 500, ed. Department of Antarctic Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Pudełko R., 2002; Brazilian Chart Nº 25121, Baía do Almirantado, 1:40,000, 1984, Rio de Janeiro; Braun et al. 2001a and b; Arigony-Neto, 2001).
Approximately 90% of the land area within the proposed ASMA is ice-covered, the ice-free areas representing about 37 km².
Earth Science features. The glacial drainage basin is formed mainly by the main ice cap of King George Island which flows from north, east and west towards the trough of Admiralty Bay. At the head of the bay, the ice cap spills into three inlets: Ezcurra, Mackellar and Martel inlets.  Heavily crevassed outlet glaciers descend towards the sea becoming tidewater glaciers. Along the west coast, in the area of ASPA Nº 128, some glaciers descending from Warszawa Peninsula (ice cap) terminate on land; others form tidewater ice cliffs. The eastern coast of the bay, from Cape Syrezol to Hennequin Point, is bordered mainly by ice-cliffs of tidewater glaciers descending from Krakow Ice Field, and by rocky spurs and narrow beaches. In the whole area of Admiralty Bay intensive deglaciation is well documented.
Geomorphology of the area is dominated by glacial erosional and depositional landforms, pebble to cobble covered beaches and raised marine terraces. Igneous and sedimentary rocks outcropping around Admiralty Bay record a complex Cenozoic evolution of a volcanic island arc intercalated with terrestrial and glacial deposits.
Climate. The climate of the Area. is typical of maritime Antarctica. Based on data of more than 20 years obtained at the Polish Arctowski Station and at the Brazilian Comandante Ferraz Station, the local microclimate is characterized by an average annual temperature of around -l.8ºC and an average annual wind speed in the order of 6.5 m s-¹. Annual average precipitation is 508,5 mm, humidity is 82% and pressure is 991 hPa. The waters of Admiralty Bay have an average annual temperature range of -1.8° to +4°C, being well mixed by tides and strongly influenced by currents from the west of Bransfield Strait.
Flora.  In the adjoining ice-free areas of Admiralty Bay, the distribution of plant communities is closely related to geoforms and to the presence of birds and soil. Wherever edaphic conditions are favorable, mosses form strands which also contain lichen and fungi formations. The lichenized mycobiota is restricted to the rock fragments and rock outcrops, sometimes associated to bird colonies. The coastal areas are the most densely covered, being represented mostly by moss carpet formations. Near the Brazilian Station two of these areas occur, both of which are almost 300 m long. As elevations start up, showing rocky outcrops, crustose lichenes and mosses which grow directly on rock predominate.  The species are listed at Appendix A.
Birds.  Within the Area, 13 species of birds breed.  Three sympatrica1ly breeding Pygoscelid penguins make up 91% of the number and up to 95% of the biomass of the breeding community.   Other seabirds breeding in the Area are: southern giant petrel; blue-eyed shag; brown skua; south polar skua; Wilson's storm petrel; black-bellied storm petrel, cape petrel, kelp gull, Antarctic tern and American sheathbill.  The areas of ASPA Nº 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, Cape Vauréal, Chabrier Island and surroundings, are the most important bird breeding locations in Admiralty Bay. Around Vaureal Cape are found nests of all species mentioned above, including all of the Area´s blue-eyed shags and 50% of its giant petrels. The species are listed at Appendix B.
Mammals.  Six species of pinnipeds occur in the Area (Appendix B). The most frequent mammal during winter is the crabeater seal.  During summer, elephant seals and fur seals are the most frequent and abundant. Fur seals, once relatively rare, have increased in number in recent years. Elephant seals and Weddell seals breed in the area. Leopard seals are found throughout the year in varying numbers.  Ross seals rarely occur in the Area.  Humpback whale is the most frequent cetacean during summer.

Marine Ecosystem.  Macroalgae, predominantly Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta, characterize the shallow water bottom community down to 50-60 m depth.  With the exception of Nacella concinna, epifauna is practically absent in the intertidal zone.  The vagile benthos is abundant with a high variety and density of Amphipoda.  Below 4-5 m, substrata are typically sandy and dominated by Isopoda, particularly the genus Serolis.  With the increasing depth, vagile species such as Sterechinus, Neobuccinum and Parborlasia dominate.  In deeper waters, on a muddy and more stable substrata, sessile forms include sponges, anemones, the bivalve Laternula elliptica and tunicates, besides high-density concentrations of echinoderms such as Amphioplus acutus, Ophionotus victoriae and Odontaster validus.  Scavenger invertebrates include Labidiaster annulatus, Gliptonotus antarcticus, Parborlasia corrugatus and Neobuccinum eatoni. The species found in the area are largely the same as those observed on similar substrata at other sites in the region, indicating homogeneity in the benthic fauna of the Antarctic Peninsula and related areas.  Fishes are represented by fifteen Nototheniidae, mainly Notothenia neglecta, N. gibberifrons, N. coriiceps, Nototheniops nudifrons, Trematodus newnesi, T. borchgrewincki and Pleuragramma antarcticum, two Channichthydae species, Hapagiferidae and Zoarcidae.  
5.2  Access to the area 
In order to minimize the risks of accidents, environmental damage or harmful interference with research activities, pedestrians, ships, small boats, aircrafts and land vehicles entering and/or operating in the Area should follow the Environmental Code of Conduct that applies within the Area. (see Section 8.0).

	This consists of the grave with a cross of Eng. W. Puchalski, an internationally acclaimed Polish nature photographer and director of Arctic and Antarctic nature films.
6.0  Special Zones within the Area
In addition to ASPA Nº 128 and Historic Site Nº 51, and to sites specified in section 5.3, the following zones were identified within the ASMA as being zones in which activities should be managed.
6.1 Zones visited by tourists and other visitors
• Arctowski and Ferraz Stations: movement of tourists and other visitors should follow the pre-established tour routes (Fig. 5). In the future, routes for tourists may be established at Machu Picchu Station and Ecuador field camp;
• Isolated laboratory modules, refuges and the area behind Ferraz Station: visits should be only by small accompanied groups. 
6.2 Zones of scientific and/or ecological interest where access by tourists and other visitors should be managed (Fig. 4):
    a. Fresh water lakes around Arctowski Station: example of freshwater environment; 
    b. Italian Valley: concentration of seals;
    c. Dufayel Island: concentration of seals;
    d. Crépin Point: concentration of seals;
    e. Area north-west of Ferraz Station: concentration of seals;
    f. Area west of Ferraz Station: concentration of seals
    g. Coastal area from Refuge Nº 1 (Ferraz Station) to Plaza Point: concentration of seals and penguins;
    h. Crosses Hill on northern flank of Ferraz, on Keller Peninsula: Concentrations of terns. Except in connection with scientific activities, survival cache replacement, or emergencies, and essential station operations, visits should be limited during the critical bird breeding season from 1 October to 31 December.
    i. Coastal area up to 7 m in shore, north of Base "G" hill: presence of vegetation banks;
    j. Freshwater ponds near Arctowski and Ferraz stations: example of freshwater environment;
    a. k.Ullman Point (Ullman Spur): concentration of seals;
        1. Hennequin Point: concentration of seals; plant fossil localities;
    b. m. Cape Vaureal - Chabrier Rock: breeding area for penguins, southern giant petrels and blue-eyed shags.  Visits should be avoided during the breeding season, from 1 October to 1 March, except in connection with scientific activities.
    c. n. Shallow marine waters down to 100 m in front of: ASPA Nº 128, Martel, Mackellar and Ezcurra Inlets; Napier Rock and Monsinet Cove: diverse benthic communities and scientific experiments and concentrations of different species of adult and juvenile fish.
Although not officially designated as protected areas under Annex V of the Protocol, the zones listed above have considerable scientific/ecological interest as breeding sites and/or concentrations of birds and/or mammals, as feeding sites for birds and marine mammals, as sites of typical vegetation cover, varied marine habitats, or sites of special scientific interest.   Some of these zones, such as Chabrier Rock and Vaureal Cape, on the eastern shore of Admiralty Bay (Fig. 2) are of great relevance, as it is the only breeding site for the Antarctic blue-eyed shag, penguins and southern giant petrel outside ASPA 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay.
Activities in all zones should be carried out with particular care to avoid or minimize disturbance of wildlife, trampling of vegetation and interference with on-going research. Freshwater lakes around Arctowski and Ferraz should be only accessed for the purpose of water supply and associated station operations and for relevant scientific research.
The marine benthic and pelagic organisms are of considerable scientific interest and are fundamental links in the marine food chain of the area. They are critically linked to maintenance of the ecological balance including that of birds and marine mammals.

Further restrictions apply to activities within ASPA Nº 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay. 

8.3 Installation, modification or removal of structures
Installation of new stations/refuges and modifications, or removal of already existing installations or other facilities in the Area, and location of field camps should be done only after consultation with the Parties that have active research programmes in the Area, and in conformity with provisions of Article 8 and Annex 1 of the Environment Protocol and this Management Plan; in a manner that does not compromise the values of the Area.
Scientific equipment installed in the Area should be clearly identified by country, name of principal investigator, contact details, and date of installation.  All equipment and associated materials should be removed when no longer in use.
Field camps should be located as far as possible on non-vegetated sites, such as on barren ash plains, slopes or beaches, or on thick snow or ice cover when practicable, and should also avoid concentrations of mammals or breeding birds.  Previously occupied campsites should be re-used where appropriate.
8.4 Taking or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
Taking or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited, except by Permit issued  under the provisions of Article 3 of Annex V to the Protocol.  Where taking or harmful interference with animals for scientific purposes is involved, the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica should be used as a minimum standard.  
Taking of marine organisms for scientific purposes should be limited to that restrictedly necessary to meet the purpose of the research.  Geological sampling of bottom sediments, particularly in shallow waters, should be carried out with extreme care so as to minimize adverse impact on the environment, or interference with other scientific research under way on benthic ecology.
8.5  The collection or removal of materials not imported into the Area
Materials should only be collected and removed from the Area for scientific, management or educational purposes, and should be limited to the minimum necessary for those needs. 
Souvenirs, specifically rocks, minerals, fossils, eggs, flora and fauna, or any other material not brought into the area by the visitor, should not be collected in, or removed from the Area.  
It may be permissible to remove from the site materials such as beach litter, dead or pathological fauna or flora or abandoned relics and artifacts from previous activities.  
8.6  Disposal of waste
Disposal of waste generated by scientific research programmes, tourism and all other governmental or non-governmental activities in the ASMA should be carried out in compliance with the provisions of Annex III of the Protocol.
All wastes, other than human and domestic liquid waste, should be removed from the Area.  


8.8  Requirements for Reports
The ASMA coordinator should maintain a record and provide summary descriptions of the reports of activities in the Area in the Annual Exchange of Information under the Antarctic Treaty for the preceding year. 
8.9  Exchange of information
Parties proposing to conduct, support, or authorize research or other activities in the Admiralty Bay ASMA are requested to inform the ASMA Coordinator as far in advance as possible of their planned activities. The Coordinator should make the information available to the other Parties. This will enable greater integration to be achieved between research programmes, enhance cooperation and avoid cumulative impacts, facilitating monitoring and management of the Area. Where applicable, provisions related to environmental impact assessment as established in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty should be followed.
At the end of each summer field season, Parties should notify the Coordinator of:
    • any activities carried out by its nationals or other parties including tourists and participants in non-governmental expeditions in the ASMA contrary to the provisions of this Management Plan ; and
    • steps taken to enforce the provisions of this Management Plan.
IAATO should, as far as practicable, provide the ASMA Coordinator with details of scheduled visits by IAATO-registered vessels.  Tour operators not affiliated to IAATO should also inform the coordinator of planned visits.

Code of Conduct for Visitors

1. Introduction

This code of conduct has been produced for commercial tour operators (IAATO and non-IAATO affiliated), private expeditions and National Antarctic Programme scientists and staff when undertaking recreational visits to Admiralty Bay.


2. General Guidelines

    • Leaders of tourist and non-governmental expeditions wishing to visit Arctowski, Ferraz or Machu Picchu stations should contact the Department of Antarctic Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences (02-141 Warsaw, Poland, Ustrzycka), the Comissão Interministerial para os Recursos do Mar (Ministério da Marinha, Esplanada dos Ministérios, 70055-900, Brasília, DF, Brazil), or the Instituto Antártico Peruano – INANPE (Jr. Ucayali 259, Lima – Perú) respectively, well in advance of the planned visit to make the necessary arrangements. This does not preclude visits in emergency situations.

    • The State Party responsible for tour operators should ensure that tour operators, their staff, tourists and other visitors are fully informed of, and comply with, the provisions of this Management Plan.

    • Expedition Leaders of cruise ships and Masters of national programme support vessels are encouraged to exchange itineraries in order to avoid two ships unintentionally converging on a site simultaneously.

    • For commercial cruise operators, no more than 100 passengers may be ashore at a site at any time, accompanied by a minimum of one member of the expedition staff for every 20 passengers.

    • Members of non-governmental and tourist expeditions visiting Arctowski and Ferraz stations should use the routes shown in Fig. 5.A and B. These routes give the opportunity to observe wildlife and the station installations, while minimizing disturbance to station activities and the environment, and avoiding habitat degradation.

    • In order to avoid environmental impact, disturbance of wildlife and interference with on-going scientific research, landing at or entering of the special zones listed in section 6.2 should not take place, except in emergencies.
    • All movement on land should be undertaken carefully to minimize disturbance to animals, soil and vegetated areas, or disturb scientific equipment.  The visitor should:
	
    • avoid walking on vegetation such as moss or lichen. 
    • maintain an appropriate distance from birds or seals which is safe and does not cause them disturbance. As a general rule, maintain a distance of 5 metres. Where practicable, keep at least 15 metres away from fur seals.
    • wash boots and clean clothes, bags, tripods and walking sticks before landing, in order to prevent biological introductions. 
    • not leave any litter.
    • not take biological or geological souvenirs or disturb artefacts.
    • not write or draw graffiti on any man-made structure or natural surface.
    • not touch or disturb scientific instruments or markers.
    • not touch or disturb field depots or other equipment stored by National Antarctic Programmes.
