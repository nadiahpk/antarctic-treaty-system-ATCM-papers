Ross Sea Protected Area Inspections 2006




Introduction
Article 10 of Annex V to the Protocol provides for Parties to make arrangements for, inter alia, collecting and exchanging records, including records of permits and reports of visits, including inspection visits, to Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and reports of inspection visits to Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs).  However, no formal, comprehensive inspections of Antarctic protected or managed areas have been conducted.
In November 2005 a joint New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States inspection programme was undertaken of selected protected and managed areas in the Ross Sea region.  The aims of the inspection were to identify whether:
    • significant changes or damage to any Antarctic Specially Managed Area, Antarctic Specially Protected Area or Historic Site or Monument visited (including changes to the values of the Areas) have occurred;
    • the management plans for each Area remains relevant;
    • the management plans for the Areas are being fully implemented; and
    • the management taking place is sufficient to protect the values of the Areas.
The inspections were undertaken by Observers designated by their respective governments in accordance with the notification procedures of Article VII(I) of the Antarctic Treaty.

Observers were:
For New Zealand: Dr Neil Gilbert (NG), Environmental Manager, Antarctica New Zealand.
For the United Kingdom: Dr John Shears (JS), Head of the Environmental Office, British Antarctic Survey (JS);
For the United States: Mr David M. Bresnahan (DB), Systems Manager, Operations and Logistics, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation;
The inspections were conducted through a series of day trips from Scott Base (NZ) and McMurdo Station (US) on Ross Island.  All inspections were carried out in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Environmental Protocol.

Protected and Managed areas that were inspected were:
    • McMurdo Dry Valleys ASMA 002
    • Cape Bird, New College Valley ASPA 116
    • Arrival Heights ASPA 122
    • Cape Royds ASPA 157
    • Cape Evans ASPA 154
    • Hut Point ASPA 158

This Working Paper provides a summary overview of the Inspection programme for the consideration of the CEP and ATCM.  A more complete version of the Inspection Report, with photographs, will be circulated at ATCM XXIX.
A checklist was drafted before the inspections and used as a basis for observations at each site.  The draft checklist is provided in a separate working paper.




General remarks and conclusions
    • The management plans for each of the Areas visited are fit for purpose and conform to Annex V.
    • Excellent international cooperation was found between US, NZ and (where relevant) Italy in managing the Areas and implementing the requirements of the management plans.  Cooperation between these three national programmes on management of the Dry Valleys ASMA was particularly notable.
    • The management measures outlined in the respective management plans remain relevant and are being implemented rigorously.  However, certain issues requiring attention were noted at certain sites.
    • Issues that require closer attention include:
    • Un-marked and un-labelled scientific equipment and other items were observed in several Areas, in particular the Dry Valleys.  The need to ensure such equipment is labelled should be applied to items already in the field, as well as to future deployment of equipment.
    • In some Areas clean up of sites of past activity is required; the Dry Valleys in particular.
    • Some Areas are poorly marked and signposted.

Key Recommendations
    • US, NZ and Italy should compile a joint inventory of sites of past activity in the Dry Valleys, as a basis for coordinated clean up.
    • The maps in the McMurdo Dry Valleys ASMA management plan should be updated and improved.  Detailed maps for Special Features should be added
    • Management measures for the Special Features in the Dry Valleys ASMA require further consideration and elaboration.
    • Consideration should be given to designating certain of the Dry Valleys ASMA Special Features as ASPAs.  Don Juan Pond is particularly noted in this regard.
    • Signage should be improved at Cape Bird, Cape Royds and possibly Hut Point.
    • Urgent attention needs to be given to snow and melt-water management at Cape Evans.
    • Ongoing conservation of the historic huts and associated artefacts is essential if the historic value of these sites is to be maintained.
    • Hut Point ASPA should be extended so as to include a buffer zone around the hut as well as Vince’s Cross on the promontory near the historic hut.
    • Signage at Arrival Heights should be revised to reflect the international nature of the ASPA.



Inspection Report: McMurdo Dry Valleys Antarctic Specially Managed Area 002

Introduction
The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest expanse of ice-free ground in Antarctica, encompassing a desert ecosystem with a cold, arid and windy environment.  The landscape of the area contains glaciers, mountain ranges, ice-covered lakes, meltwater streams, patterned soils and permafrost, sand dunes and interconnected watershed systems.
The region is characterised by unique ecosystems of low biodiversity and reduced food-web complexity.  It also contains unusual microhabitats and biological communities (such as endolithic and cryoconite systems) as well as special glaciological features and minerals (such as salt deposits and desert pavements).
A proposal for designating the Dry Valleys as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area was put to the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) in June 2003.  The CEP sent the draft management plan for intersessional review.  In June 2004, on the advice of the CEP, the ATCM adopted the management plan and designated the Dry Valleys as ASMA 002 (Measure 1 (2004)).
The Dry Valleys Management Plan sets out a description of the Area, aims and objectives and management activities in accordance with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol.  Given the large scale of the area, the management plan identifies a series of restricted and managed zones within the area, divided between facilities zones, a tourism zone and special features.
Also included within the plan are an environmental code of conduct and a series of guidelines covering the conduct of scientific research and activities within facilities zones, the tourism zone and special features.
Inspection
The inspection of the Dry Valleys was separated over two day visits (19 and 22 November).  Given the large area, the inspectors were necessarily selective in what they were able to see.  A focus was given to the Taylor and Wright Valleys, given that a significant amount of the activity that takes place in the Dry Valleys (scientific research and tourism) occurs in these two valleys.  The inspection focussed specifically on the tourism zone at Canada Glacier; selected facilities zones and special features, as a way of assessing the key components of the ASMA.  
The facilities zones visited were:
    • New Harbour
    • Lake Hoare
    • Cape Roberts
    • Lake Vanda
    • Lower Wright
The special features visited were:
    • Don Juan Pond
    • Victoria sand-dune fields
Two temporary New Zealand scientific field camps were also inspected in the Lower Wright Valley and Victoria dune fields.


Canada Glacier tourism zone
Site description
Only one tourism zone is designated within the ASMA.  The site is situated adjacent to the head of the Canada Glacier in the lower Taylor Valley.  Tour ship groups visit the site each summer season by means of helicopter.  Scientific parties working in the vicinity also enter the zone.
Site inspection
The inspection team visited the site by helicopter on 22 November 2005.   Key observations were:
    • The map in the ASMA management plan (Map N) provides only limited information about the site, some of which is inaccurate;
    • The circuit followed by visitors to the Area was relatively easy to locate, even though no visits had yet been made during the 2005 / 06 season.  Monitoring of the site to observe the extent of and changes to tracking may be useful.
    • Consideration may also need to be given to renaming the site, as nearby ASPA 131 is also titled “Canada Glacier”.  (Green Creek Tourism Zone may be a better description of the site; though an approved toponym will need to be used).
Recommendations
    • An improved map of the tourism zone should be prepared with key features and topography accurately surveyed;
    • Site monitoring should be undertaken to assess the effects of human visitation, including for example changes in tracking throughout the site;
    • Consideration should be given to the name of the site to better reflect its location and avoid potential confusion with Canada Glacier ASPA 131.

New Harbour Facility Zone
Site description
The site is located on the coast at the far end of the Taylor Valley, and at the north-western side of New Harbour bay.  The area includes a flat, slightly raised beach comprised of gravels and sands.  The facilities zone comprises a US field camp with two Jamesway buildings connected by a wooden passageway, a laboratory, a storage shed, a generator building, a large solar panel, a wind generator and tower, an outhouse and a diving equipment storage box.  
The facilities zone also includes two abandoned boreholes from the Dry Valleys Drilling Project (a joint New Zealand / US geological drilling programme which took place in the early 1970’s).
Site inspection
The inspection team visited the site on 22 November 2005.  A US research team was present at the site undertaking a programme of research on marine foraminifera, which included a programme of nearshore diving.  Permits authorising the activities were readily available and shown to the inspection team.  Key observations of the inspection team were:
    • The facilities zone was being well managed in accordance with the requirements of the ASMA management plan;
    • All waste, including human waste, was being exported from the camp;
    • Vehicles were being used appropriately;
    • Chemicals brought into the facilities zone for laboratory use were properly stored and appropriately labelled.  
    • The map of the site (Map G) in the ASMA management plan is limited and includes a number of inaccuracies (such as the location of the buildings and the omission of the wind generator, solar panel and site topography). 
    • Boreholes remaining from the Dry Valleys Drilling Project in the 1970s were labelled.  No evidence of impact beyond the boreholes was seen.
Recommendations
    • An improved map (Map G) for the New Harbour facility zone should be prepared and clarify the location of the Explorers Cove special feature on Map A, in the ASMA management plan.
    • Consideration should be given to how best to clean up the DVDP boreholes.
Lake Hoare Facility Zone
Site description
Lake Hoare facility zone is located on the northern shore of Lake Hoare in the lower Taylor Valley, immediately to the west of Canada Glacier.  Lake Hoare is a year-round frozen lake that has been the subject of considerable scientific research for several years, as part of the US-led Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) programme.
Several buildings are sited within the zone: the main “mess” building, three laboratory huts, two incinerating  toilets, two outhouses, a Jamesway store hut, a divers’ hut and a divers’ shower hut.  Three large solar panels are situated close to the main “mess” hut.  Scientists and support staff are accommodated in tents and designated camping sites are incorporated into the facility zone.
Site inspection
The Inspection Team visited the facility zone on 22 November 2005 and was escorted around the site by the Camp Manager Rae Spain.  Key observations were:
    • The map of the zone within the ASMA management plan (Map J) is a good example of the type of maps that should be provided, with topography and key features shown.
    • The facilities zone is being run in accordance with (and in some cases exceeding) the requirements of the ASMA management plan:
    • Vehicles (ATVs) are used within the area, but only on the frozen lake.  At the time of inspection one vehicle was observed parked on the lake, with a drip tray underneath to catch any minor fuel or oil leaks.
    • Waste materials (including food waste) are packaged, labelled and returned to McMurdo.  Incinerating toilets are used for human waste.
    • All fuel stored on site is stored within secondary containment.
    • Scientific equipment (data loggers, ablation stakes) is deployed within and around the area.  All equipment is labelled and its position recorded by GPS.
    • The Inspection Team noted that the efficient and environmentally friendly way the Lake Hoare camp was run was a tribute to the experience and enthusiasm of the Camp Manager (Ms Spain) and the United States Antarctic Program.
Recommendation
    • The Lake Hoare camp should be used as a model example of how to establish and run a fixed facility zone within an ASMA.
Cape Roberts Facility Zone

Site description
Cape Roberts is a small ice-free coastal peninsula situated on the southern side of Granite Harbour.  
The facility zone includes an area of flat ground where two Antarctica New Zealand huts, a toilet and a fuel depot are located.
The buildings were erected in the 1980s and the site used for winter storage of vehicles, drilling and camp equipment during the Cape Roberts Project (CRP); a multinational marine sediment drilling programme from 1995 to 2000.  The site was cleaned up in 2000/01 following completion of the drilling programme.  The huts were left in place to support tide gauge measurements, which are still undertaken and supported by Victoria University of Wellington and Land Information New Zealand (LINZ).
Site inspection
The inspection team visited the site on 22 November 2005, accompanied by Mr Alex Pyne of Victoria University.  Key observations were:
    • The map within the ASMA management plan (Map F) provides sufficient information about the site.
    • The inspection team did not have time to walk around the full extent of the site, but within the vicinity of the huts there was no evidence of impact at the site from the Cape Roberts drilling programme.   The clean up appears to have been thorough.
    • The facility zone is useful for supporting scientific research being undertaken in the area, though the inspectors noted that this requires very limited time on site.  The low use of the huts may warrant a review of whether to retain or remove them.
Recommendation
    • Keep the Cape Roberts facility zone under review with respect to the need to retain the huts. 
Lake Vanda Facility Zone
Site description
Lake Vanda is a stratified freshwater lake located in the upper Wright Valley.  The lake is the largest of its type in the region and has been the subject of considerable scientific study for several decades.
To support research in the area the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme established a field station on the shore of Lake Vanda in 1968/69.  However, due to concerns over rising lake levels, the base was decommissioned and largely removed in the mid-1990s.
Some of the original facilities were relocated to a suitable, higher site further from the lake shore to support fieldwork.  These buildings have been included in a facility zone under the provisions of the ASMA management plan.
Site inspection
The Inspection Team visited the site on 19 November 2005 by helicopter.  Key observations were:
    • The designated helicopter pad (Map C in the ASMA management plan) is not marked and hard to locate.  Map C is also basic with no topography or any key geographical features shown.
    • An automatic weather station has been established to the south west of the huts, but this equipment is not marked or labelled.
    • An unmarked, painted (empty) fuel drum is located to the east of the facility zone on top of a small cairn.  Unless still in use as a marker, this needs to be removed.
Recommendations
    • Consideration should be given to marking the helicopter pad at Vanda huts.
    • Ensure all scientific installations (such as the meteorological station in the facility zone) are clearly labelled with the country, principal investigator’s name and year of installation, as required by the ASMA management plan.
    • Keep the Lake Vanda facility zone under review.  If not being utilised fully, consideration should be given to removing some or all of the huts.
    • The empty fuel drum to the east of the facility zone should be removed (or, if still in use as a marker, properly labelled).
Bull Pass Facility Zone
Site description
Bull Pass facility zone is situated half way along the Wright Valley at the base of Bull Pass, which connects the Wright Valley with the McKelvey Valley to the north.
The site is used to support the Dry Valleys Seismic Project that monitors regional and global seismicity. This station is an element in the US Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) Southern Network (ASN). The network provides near real time seismic data from nine locations within the southern hemisphere. The data is telemetered to the National Data Center in Florida via McMurdo station and is available to the international scientific community. 
Every year project team members from the US carry out maintenance of the facility’s power and electrical systems.
Site inspection
The Inspection Team visited the site on 19 November 2005 by helicopter, landing at the designated helicopter-landing site (Map E of the ASMA management plan).  Key observations were:
    • The helicopter landing pad is clearly marked, though with green cotton “flags” pegged into the ground which are likely to deteriorate and disperse.  Making use of the borehole casings, which litter the facility zone, may be a better option for marking the helicopter landing pad.
    • Whilst the Management Plan map contains the key features and facilities of the site, revising the map to include topography would improve its usefulness.
    • All materials and equipment left outside of the huts is well secured, but it was noted that six fuel drums outside the main hut did not have secondary containment.  Three of the drums were full and three were empty.  No evidence of any spills was noted.
    • Sections of borehole core mark seven past tent sites.  These are marked on the map in the ASMA plan for re-use, but such a large number of designated camp sites is not necessary for current activities.
    • An empty fuel drum is located in the centre of the zone adjacent to the seismic boreholes.  It is not clear if this drum serves any purpose and consideration should be given to removing it.
Recommendations
    • The helicopter landing pad could be marked with core sections from unnecessary tent sites and the cotton flags removed;
    • All fuel drums should be placed in some form of secondary containment (now achieved);
    • The empty fuel drum located within the site should be removed if no longer required;
    • The number of designated camping sites should be rationalised and the map updated accordingly.
Special feature: Don Juan Pond
Site description
Don Juan Pond is situated in the Upper Wright Valley.  The area includes a hypersaline “pond” (the saltiest body of water on earth) surrounded by salt deposits left behind by lake evaporation and shrinkage. The area is the subject of some scientific investigation with water and soil sampling in the past.  Scientists operating in the area are subject to the standard ASMA provisions.  Specific guidance for the special feature is to avoid walking through the lake or disturbing the associated salt deposits.  
Site inspection
The Inspection Team visited this special feature on 19 November 2005 by helicopter.  Key observations were:
    • There is no designated helicopter landing site (or campsite) for the area, or any detailed map.
    • A borehole from the Dry Valleys Drilling Project (DVDP) is present at the western end of the feature.  The inspectors did not enter the site to view this closely.  Consideration should be given to its removal, provided that clean up activity will not cause greater harm to the salt pans and pond than leaving the borehole in its current state.  It is noted that the United States Antarctic Program has been conducting an assessment of all DVDP drill sites and is preparing plans for their clean up and closure. 
    • The inspection team also noted the rather scant management advice in the ASMA Management Plan regarding access to and movement within this special feature.  Additional guidance may be required.  Furthermore, given the unique nature of the area in Antarctic and global terms, consideration should be given to ASPA designation.
Recommendations
    • Given the scientific and global significance of the area, improved management guidance should be included in the ASMA management plan, e.g. improved mapping of the area showing the preferred helicopter landing site and camping areas.  Alternatively consideration should be given to designating the site as an ASPA.
    • An environmental impact assessment should be prepared in order to assess options for the DVDP borehole, in particular to determine whether there is likely to be greater environmental impacts from removing the borehole as opposed to leaving it in place. 
Special feature: Victoria sand-dune field
Site description
The Victoria dune fields are situated in the lower Victoria Valley, east of Lake Vida and are the largest sand dune feature in the region.  
Site inspection
The inspection team visited the Victoria dune fields on 19 November 2005.  Key observations were:
    • There is no map for the area included in the ASMA management plan, and no designated helicopter landing site or campsite.
    • The inspection team also noted the advice in the management plan to avoid walking on the dunes.  The researchers visited by the inspection team suggested that this was somewhat counter-intuitive, in that the mobile, dynamic nature of the dunes means that they are likely to recover quickly from foot traffic, whereas the patterned ground around the dunes would take considerably longer to recover.
Recommendations
Consideration should be given to the adequacy and accuracy of the management advice in the ASMA Management Plan regarding the need to avoid walking on the dunes (further scientific advice may be required).
Mapping of the area, including identifying suitable helicopter landing sites and camping areas would be useful.
New Zealand Field Camps: K047, Lower Victoria Valley and K064, Lower Wright Valley
The Inspection Team visited two New Zealand science events (event numbers: K047 and K064) on 19 November 2005.  Both events were camping and demonstrated good awareness of the requirements of the ASMA management plan.  The camps were being run according to management plan requirements.  All waste including human waste was being collected and returned to Scott Base; fuel was stored in secondary containment (though both camps noted difficulties in avoiding minor spillage when refuelling due to the design of the containers) and rocks used to weigh down tents would be put back in their original location on departure.
Summary
The Dry Valleys ASMA management plan is providing effective management of this highly significant region of Antarctica.  The management plan is being rigorously implemented by national programmes operating in the region through a high level of co-operation.  The facilities zones and special features are largely working well.  The following improvements could be made to further enhance management in the region:
    • All scientific equipment and installations should be clearly labelled with the country, principal investigator’s name and year of installation, as required by the ASMA management plan.  Any markers left for more than a summer season should be labelled with the science event number and duration to be left in place.
    • Equipment, markers etc that are clearly outdated and un-used should be removed.
    • Further information including appropriate maps needs to be prepared for the special features in the ASMA.  The features should also be systematically assessed to determine whether they remain significant and if ASPA designation is more appropriate.
    • Facilities zones should be checked regularly to ensure that the guidelines are being followed, including secondary containment of fuel and appropriate marking of helicopter landing sites.
    • The maps for certain of the facilities zones should be updated to ensure all maps are of the same standard.
    • The removal of little used facilities should be regularly considered by the national operators responsible.
Inspection Report: Discovery Hut ASPA 158

Introduction
Scott’s Discovery expedition hut was built in 1902 and designated as Historic Site and Monument No. 18 in 1972 (Recommendation VII-9).  It was designated as Specially Protected Area 28 in 1998 (Measure 1) and subsequently became Antarctic Specially Protected Area 158 (Decision 1 (2002)).  The management plan was reviewed and a revised version with additional visitor management provisions adopted in 2005 (Measure 2 (2005)).
The Discovery hut served mainly as a store for the British National Antarctic Expedition 1901-1904, making the Hut Point site one of the principal sites of early human activity in Antarctica.  The hut and the artefacts it contains are relics of the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration and have considerable historical, cultural and scientific significance. 
Site Inspection
The Inspection Team (JS and NG) visited the site on 17 November 2005, by means of a four wheel drive vehicle from Scott Base to the vicinity of the ASPA.  The Inspectors were part of a guided recreational visit to the site for base personnel.  A separate visit to the surrounding area (but not the hut) was made on 18 November 2005.  Key observations were:
    • Vehicle tracks were observed very close to the side of the hut, although it was not clear how recent these were.  Vehicular access to the hut is currently prevented by two large concrete blocks located at the end of the McMurdo road.
    • There are a number of recently installed markers and plaques around the hut that, in the view of the Inspectors, detracted from the historical values of the site. 
Management Plan
    • The cultural, historical and scientific values for which the site was designated remain relevant.  
    • The aims and objectives of the management plan remain highly relevant.  
    • Implementation of the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust Conservation Plan for the hut and artefacts will be essential if the values of the site are to be effectively protected.
    • Only the hut itself is designated as an ASPA.  It would help protect the hut if a buffer zone around the hut were provided.  Vinces’s Cross (Historic Site and Monument No. 17) could also be included within the new ASPA boundary.
    • The limits on annual visitation numbers seem appropriate.  The maps of the site are adequate.  As well as maintaining a record of visitor numbers, other monitoring work is being conducted to assess visitor impacts on the hut, such as humidity measurements and photo-monitoring.
    • The Management Plan contains a Code of Conduct for visitors to the hut and the inspectors considered that this could be provided in printed form to all visitors to help reinforce the requirements.
Human Activity
    • In accordance with the revised management plan, both national programmes have nominated and trained a number of guides who must accompany any recreational visits to the hut.  Provided it is consistently implemented this should continue to provide an effective means of managing access to the huts.


Recommendations
    • The area covered by the ASPA should be reviewed so as to include the whole tip of Hut Point, from the end of the access road.  This would have the advantage of providing a buffer zone around Discovery Hut as well as including Vince’s Cross.
    • The concrete blocks at the end of the access road from McMurdo Station should remain in place to prevent vehicles from getting too close to the hut.
    • Consideration should be given to relocating the plaques and markers from around the hut to a suitable distance (e.g. near the concrete blocks); particularly so if a buffer zone around the hut is implemented. 
    • The United States and New Zealand Antarctic programmes should consider providing a standardised leaflet on the hut, containing the Code of Conduct, to all visitors. 
    • The New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust Conservation Plan for the hut and artefacts should be implemented at the earliest opportunity if the values of the site are to be effectively protected.
    • The guided visit system should continue and be rigorously enforced.

Inspection report: Cape Evans ASPA 155
Introduction
Scott’s Terra Nova expedition hut and a nearby memorial cross were designated as Historic Sites and Monuments 16 and 17 in 1972 (Recommendation VII-9) and then as Specially Protected Area 25 in 1997 (Measure XXI-2) and subsequently became Antarctic Specially Protected Area 155 (Decision 1 (2002)).  The management plan was reviewed and a revised version with additional visitor management provisions adopted by means of Measure 2 (2005).
The hut and artefacts it contains are important relics from the Heroic Age of exploration and as such have important historical and cultural importance.  Some of the earliest advances in the study of earth sciences, meteorology and biology are associated with the Terra Nova Expedition.  
Site Inspection
The Inspection Team (JS and NG only) visited the site on 20 November 2005.  Transport to the site was by means of a Hägglunds vehicle over sea ice.  Access into the ASPA was made on foot.  Key observations were:
Management Plan

    • The values for which the area was designated are still relevant and the aims and objectives of the management plan are appropriate to protect these values.
    • Based on recorded visitor numbers per season since 1998, the current visitor limits appear to be appropriate.
    • The maps included within the Management Plan are appropriate and easy to use.  
    • There are no signs along the beach (the primary access point) indicating that the area is an ASPA.  Consideration might be given to erecting such a sign.
Human Activity
    • Recreational and educational visits are made throughout the year from the nearby Scott Base and McMurdo Station.  Tourists from passenger ships also visit the hut.  The Inspectors visited the site as part of an Antarctica New Zealand guided visit in accordance with the provisions of the management plan.  The guide system provides an excellent mechanism for controlling access to the hut.
    • There were no new structures in the area, no evidence of any vehicles being used in the site and no evidence of waste being left behind.  No camping activity was observed in the area.
    • Management activities include:
    • A Conservation Pan for the site prepared by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust sets out a multi- year work schedule to restore the hut and conserve its artefacts;
    • A monitoring programme to measure temperature and humidity levels in the hut;
    • Close cooperation between the US and New Zealand Antarctic programmes to ensure that visitor numbers do not exceed the restrictions set out in the management plan.
    • A New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust team had undertaken some emergency repair work earlier in the season to prop up the partially collapsed stable roof.  The roof had fallen in due to significant build up of snow.  Large amounts of snow had also been removed from walls and doors of the hut.
 Other Observations
The most obvious threat to the values of the area is the significant build up and drifting of snow around and over the hut and surrounding artefacts.  Snow has accumulated to the rear of the building up to the height of the roof and two large drifts now surround the remaining sides of the building.  Discussions with the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust indicate that the snow and ice build-up is causing three problems.  Firstly melt water has been accumulating inside the hut and refreezing, causing damage to the floor, lower parts of the walls and furniture inside the hut.  Secondly, water ingress is creating conditions conducive to fungal growth, which has been identified by New Zealand scientists as being problematic (see for example, Blanchette et al, 2004).  Thirdly, the weight of the snow is placing significant pressure on the roofs of the hut and stable, with some structural damage being caused.
Active snow management is a clear priority at this ASPA.  In the short term, consideration needs to be given to clearing the significant drifts to the rear and sides of the hut.  This may require the use of plant and/or vehicles (though this is currently prohibited under the provisions of the Management Plan).  The need to undertake snow clearance so as to minimise damage to either the hut or those artefacts known to lie underneath the snow must be a priority in the planning of such work.
In the longer term, consideration needs to be given to active snow and melt water management, through for example, the construction of snow fences and drainage channels.
Discussions with the Heritage Trust suggest that the artefacts within the hut also require urgent attention if they are to be conserved.  Natural decay is causing the loss of significant elements of the huts contents and early intervention will be essential if they are to be conserved.  
Recommendations
    • Urgent consideration needs to be given to emergency snow clearance around the hut, which may require vehicular access.
    • In the longer term consideration needs to be given to active snow and melt water management in order to preserve the values of the ASPA, including for example, the construction of snow fences and drainage channels.
    • The Conservation Plan for this site should be implemented at the earliest opportunity if the historic values of the hut and artefacts are to be maintained.
    • Regularly used entry points to the ASPA should be marked with clear signage.




Inspection report: ASPA 157 Cape Royds 

Introduction
Shackleton’s hut at Cape Royds was listed as Historic Site and Monument No. 15 in Recommendation 9 (1972).  It was designated as Specially Protected Area No. 27 in Measure 1 (1998) and redesignated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 157 by means of Decision 1 (2002).
Structures associated with the hut include stables, kennels, a toilet and a garage created for the first motor vehicle in Antarctica.  Other significant relics in the Area include an instrument shelter, supply depots, and a rubbish site.  Numerous additional artefacts are distributed around the Area.
Cape Royds is one of the principal areas of early human activity in Antarctica.  It is an important symbol of the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration and has considerable historical significance
ASPA 157 is adjacent to ASPA 121, designated to protect the southernmost known Adélie penguin colony, which is the subject of long-term research.
Site Inspection
The Inspection Team (NG and JS only) visited the site on 20 November 2005, by means of a Hägglunds vehicle and a walk from the sea-ice into the ASPA.  The Inspectors were able to conduct an inspection of the historic hut and view the restoration and conservation work being undertaken by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust.  Key observations were:
    • There are no boundary makers for ASPA 157.  Consideration may need to be given to marking the site and indicating the correct entry point into ASPA 157 from Backdoor Bay.  Seasonal signage placed on the sea ice may be a practical option given that most visits arrive in surface vehicles over the ice.

Management Plan

    • The values for which the site was designated were still relevant, though it is not clear whether the aesthetic values outlined in the management plan are relevant.
    • The aims and objectives of the management plan remain highly relevant.  The hut and its artefacts are currently receiving significant attention through the conservation work being undertaken by the Antarctic Heritage Trust, in accordance with a dedicated Conservation Plan.  The close monitoring of visitor access by the New Zealand and United States Antarctic programmes, was also noted.
    • The Inspectors visited the hut under the guidance of one of the designated New Zealand guides.  The system appeared to work very effectively and provided a robust means of ensuring compliance with the management plans and the associated Code of Conduct.  
    • The visitation limits set out in the management plan are appropriate.
    • The maps included within the management plan appear to be adequate, though it was noted that the met screen to the south of the hut is not marked on Map B of the management plan.
Human activity in the Area
    • Management activities include:
    • A dedicated and professional programme of conservation work undertaken by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust in accordance with a Conservation Plan.  At the time of the inspection the focus of the work was the retrieval of stores boxes along the eastern and southern outside walls of the hut; 
    • monitoring of visitor numbers by the New Zealand and US programmes
    • The conservation team had established a camp at the designated campsite and were operating in accordance with the requirements of the management plan.
Recommendations
    • The conservation work being undertaken at Cape Royds is a first in Antarctica.  As such the work clearly provides an opportunity to set standards by which heritage conservation work is undertaken and to identify best practice approaches.  It will be important to ensure that the same approach is taken for the other historic huts in the Ross Sea region.  It will also be important to ensure that the lessons learned are adequately recorded and the information made widely available so as to benefit similar conservation efforts.
    • Regularly used entry points to the ASPA should be marked with clear (even seasonal) signage.
    • The signage for adjacent ASPA 121 should be updated.

Inspection report: ASPA 122 Arrival Heights 
Introduction
Arrival Heights was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 2 in 1975 (Recommendation VII-4) to prevent disturbance to an electromagnetically ‘quiet’ area.  Although activities associated with nearby McMurdo Station and Scott Base have diminished these values, protection is still required for long-running upper atmosphere measurement research which is carried out at the site. The management plan for the site was adopted in 2004 (Measure 2).
The ASPA is situated 1km to the north of McMurdo Station (US) and 3km from Scott Base.  Access to the site is controlled by the Station Managers at both stations.  Copies of the Management Plan for the ASPA are held at both bases.  
Site Inspection
The Inspection Team visited the site on 21 November (JS and NG) and again on 24 November (JS, NG and DB).  Access to the site was by means of four-wheel drive vehicles from Scott Base and McMurdo Station.  Both the NZ and US research facility were visited.  During the second visit, the Inspection Team was accompanied by Dr Rebecca Bachelor (United States Arrival Heights facilities assistant).  Key observations were:
Management Plan
    • The values for which the area was designated remain relevant.  However it is clear that the expansion of activities associated with Scott Base and McMurdo Station have encroached upon the ASPA.  The management plan acknowledges that “the electromagnetically ‘quiet’ conditions have to some degree been degraded by the operation and radio communication activities adjacent on [sic] the Hut Point Peninsula.”  However the management plan notes that “the nature, magnitude and extent of the transmissions are such that the original values for which the site was designated are still considered worthy of protection.”
    • Current scientific research at the site appears to be run with “acceptable low levels” of interference from other activities in the vicinity.  The aims and objectives set out in the management plan therefore remain relevant.  It will be important to ensure that the Plan’s requirements are actively implemented to ensure no further encroachment or impact on science occurs.
    • Signs are clearly visible on the access road to the ASPA; though it was noted that the signs refer only to US entry to the ASPA.
    • It was not clear if the electromagnetic noise surveys required by the management plan were being regularly carried out.
    • The maps within the management plan are acceptable.  However, there are several antenna arrays and aerials that are not shown on Map B.  It was also noted that Antarctica New Zealand intends to construct a new research facility on a new site within the ASPA (though close to the existing buildings).  An IEE has been prepared for this work, which is expected to be completed during the 2006/07 season.  A new map will need to be prepared to show the location of the new facility.
Human Activity
    • Scientists and technicians from both the New Zealand and United States Antarctic programmes access the area year round to conduct research and maintain the monitoring equipment in the huts.  There is good evidence of scientific cooperation between the two national programmes working in the area.
    • There have been concerns with entry into the site by un-permitted personnel from the nearby stations (notably Scott Base).  However, the revised management plan (Measure 2 (2004)) has clarified the circumstances under which visits can be made to the ASPA. Antarctica New Zealand has also strengthened its internal policy to increase the understanding of staff as to how the permit system for this site operates, and stopped any non-work related visits.
    • All waste, sewage and grey water generated at the research facilities are returned to either Scott Base or McMurdo Station.
Other observations
    • The sole purpose of the ASPA designation is to protect the science that is being conducted from the US and NZ research facilities within the Area, which otherwise has no particular intrinsic values.  Electromagnetic noise disturbing the science can originate outside the Area.   The main management need is therefore coordination of potentially disruptive activities, rather than control of physical access to the site.  To that extent, consideration might be given to whether an ASPA is the appropriate tool in this instance.  Given the close location of the research facilities to McMurdo Station and Scott Base, the regular access by personnel to the research facilities and the lack of any other intrinsic values, consideration might be given to using other tools (e.g.  ASMA designation or agreed Code of Conduct and procedures for coordination) to ensure the science can continue undisturbed.
Recommendations
    • The ASPA signage should be reviewed to ensure it is more neutral, referring to all relevant national authorities.
    • Training and documentation should continue to maintain awareness of the site’s ASPA status and entry conditions among Antarctica New Zealand staff.
    • A review should be undertaken to determine whether ASPA designation is the most appropriate way to protect the science undertaken at Arrival Heights.
    • Regular electromagnetic noise survey should be undertaken as required by the management plan.



Inspection report: ASPA 116 Cape Bird 
Introduction
Caughley Beach was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI No. 10), in 1985 (Recommendations XIII-8) to protect vegetation and associated micro-fauna within an ice cap melt catchment.  A smaller area within the SSSI, New College Valley, was designated as Specially Protected Area (SPA No. 20, Recommendation XIII-12), to serve as a reference site with minimal activity. In 2000 the management plans were revised to provide a single area, ASPA 116, with a restricted zone covering the former SPA.
The area contains some of the richest stands of mosses and associated microflora and fauna on Ross Island.  The mosses are restricted to small, localised areas (up to 20m2) of water-flushed ground.  In addition, a diverse range of algal species inhabit streams in the area and collembolans and mites are plentiful on water surfaces and underneath rocks.  The absence of lichens makes the species assemblage in this area unique on Ross Island.
The Management Plan states that the ecosystem at this site is of exceptional scientific value for ecological investigations and the restricted zone within the site is a valuable reference site for future comparative studies.
Site Inspection
The Inspection Team (JS and NG only) visited the site on 23rd November 2005.  Transport to the site was by helicopter, landing at the designated site on Caughley Beach.  Access into the site was by foot.  The Inspection Team visited the northern section of the ASPA only.  No entry was made into the restricted zone.  Key observations were:
Management Plan
    • Given the short duration of the Inspection, it was hard to make a well-informed judgement as to whether the values for which the site was designated remain valid; however this would appear to be the case.  
    • The Inspection Team considered that the aims and objectives of the management plan are appropriate and relevant.  There was also good evidence of active site management.  Boundary markers, in the form of rock cairns, were evident and an ASPA information sign was in place.  Unfortunately the ASPA sign is situated inside the ASPA, adjacent to the boundary to the restricted zone.  It needs to be relocated to the northern boundary of the area.
    • Map B needs to be updated so that it shows the (correct) location of the ASPA sign, as well as the NZ store hut / toilet which is situated to the south of the Cape Bird hut.  Given the importance of the flora in the site, consideration should also be given to including a vegetation map in the Management Plan, including the restricted zone.
Human Activity
    • Some confusion exists among New Zealand researchers using the nearby hut as to where the protected area boundary lies (see below) and as a result some inadvertent transgressions into the site had occurred.
    • Activities associated with Cape Bird hut have potential to partially impact the site in so far as researchers living at the hut collect snow (for water) from a large gully immediately adjacent to the north-western corner of the ASPA.  Some transgression into the site (though only just into the ASPA) has occurred as a result of this activity.  Relocating the ASPA sign to the north western corner of the site should help to prevent this in future.
Recommendations

    • The ASPA sign should be relocated to the north western corner of the area.
    • A revised map B should be prepared showing the location of the ASPA sign as well as other structures in the vicinity of the protected area, notably the store hut and toilet near the New Zealand, Cape Bird hut.
    • Consideration should be given to preparing a vegetation map of the site.

Concluding remarks
This is the first time that comprehensive formal inspections of protected areas have been conducted under the provisions of Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol.  As such some concluding remarks as to the process we followed may be appropriate.
In general terms the process appears to have worked reasonably well.  During a two-week period in Antarctica we were able to undertake inspections of five ASPAs and one ASMA.  The draft checklist (see separate Working Paper) proved particularly useful in ensuring consistency of approach at each of the sites visited as well as making certain that all of the key issues were addressed.
As with many activities in Antarctica we found that visits to certain sites were somewhat hurried and with hindsight more time could have been spent at some of the Areas visited.  However, in most cases site visits were supplemented by discussions with key personnel who were able to provide additional background information (for example, the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust in respect of the historic hut ASPAs).  This consultation exercise proved to be an essential part of the inspection process and provided a more complete picture of the key issues and challenges at the sites visited.
A particular advantage of undertaking inspections of protected areas is that it provides an objective assessment of the state of the protected area and its management plan; particularly so if the inspections are carried out by Parties other than those intimately involved in the management of the site.  Such an approach would be of significant value at the time of reviewing a management plan, which can then be revised, at least in part, on the basis of the inspection report.
We look forward to further protected area inspections being undertaken elsewhere in Antarctica so that the procedures for doing so can be further refined.
