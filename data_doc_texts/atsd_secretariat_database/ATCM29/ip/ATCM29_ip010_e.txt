Antarctica New Zealand supported thirty science events in the 2005/2006 season. The research undertaken by these events fall under three interdisciplinary research themes that are outlined in the New Zealand Science Strategy for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (2004-2009) that Antarctica New Zealand published in 2004. Each theme is subdivided into several sub-themes for clarification purposes. Following is a summary of the research undertaken under these themes:

Antarctic Physical Environments Research
The Lithosphere: Four projects fall under this sub-theme. These aim to: determine how magma reached the surface to feed massive basaltic lava flows of the Ferrar large igneous province in the Coombs Hills; describe the various aspects of the volcanic rocks of Mt Morning, the most southerly of a series of central-type volcanoes that make up the McMurdo Volcanic Group of southern Victoria Land; better understand the structure and development of the Trans-Antarctic mountain range and its geological relationship with the Southern Ocean, the Ross Sea and New Zealand; and provide continuous recordings of the earth’s magnetic field from 1957.
The Atmosphere: Five long-term studies are supported under this sub-theme. These monitor: the general circulation of the atmosphere, in particular the behaviour of wave-driven circulation in the middle atmosphere and how this effects the transport of energy and momentum to higher altitudes; magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and space weather at high latitudes; the drivers of change in the atmosphere, particularly those involved in the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole; human-induced long-term trends in trace gases to determine changes in oxidative capacity of the atmosphere; and the Scott Base climate record from 1957.
Climate Change: The largest project under this sub-theme is ANDRILL, which had a preparatory year for its first season of drilling next season. Also included is the NZ portion of the international project ITASE aimed at collecting and analysing ice cores to determine the spatial climate variability across Antarctica over the last 200 years. This project focuses on coastal cores which have been shown to be very sensitive to climatic variability. Finally, a project aimed at obtaining and dating samples of relict ground ice in the Dry Valleys which are thought to be older that the ice in the ice sheets, thus having paleoclimatic indicator implications.
The Cryosphere: The first of two projects aims to determine the composition of the meltwater and the pattern of water flow at a cold-based glacier, in order to make the connection between glacier and stream hydrology. A second long-term study on sea ice and Southern Ocean processes is looking at the physical oceanography of McMurdo Sound, the turbulence that exists under sea ice and its influence on ice formation, circulation in Antarctic fjords, and the physical processes involved in the formation of frazil ice beneath land-fast sea ice.






Southern Ocean Research
Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystems: A strong and diverse marine programme is made up of 5 projects. These aim to: document the distribution, embryological development and biochemical changes in the eggs of Pleurogramma antarcticum (Antarctic silverfish), with particular emphasis on their resistance to freezing; test the hypothesis that different fish have different abilities to acclimatise to increases in water temperature, and look at the influence of habitat on that acclimation; increase our knowledge of how lipid transport and metabolism systems work in notothenioid fish and to determine whether this lipid transport system is related to cold adaptation; understand the effects of increased ultraviolet-B radiation on Antarctic invertebrate larvae and photosynthetically available radiation on the sea ice marine community; and look at the phylogeography and mechanisms of speciation among notothenioid fish. 

Antarctic Ecosystems Research
Terrestrial Biodiversity: Three projects under this sub-theme are aimed at: understanding the functioning of terrestrial fungi that exist on the introduced materials of the Historic Huts areas and in the natural environment, and looking at the fungal biodiversity between different locations; using modern molecular phylogenetic methods to study the distribution of micro-organisms in Antarctic soil, understanding the key environmental factors that dictate this distribution, and determining the role in the community structure that these micro-organisms play; and studying the biodiversity and performance of lichens and mosses in the Cape Hallett region, including the setting up of growth assessment points for longer term monitoring.

Human Ecology: One project examines the values of visitors to the Ross Sea region by investigating influences on decision-making about environmental ethics.

Management and Conservation: Research supports environmental protection and management of ice-free areas of the Ross Sea region by increasing the fundamental knowledge and understanding of Antarctic soils including soil distribution and climate, and vulnerability to human impact.

Ecosystem Functioning. Six projects under this sub-theme aim to: establish an inventory of gastrointestinal bacteria in Adèlie and Emperor penguins, south polar skuas and Weddell seals to determine the transfer of micro-organisms between the environment and these species; test a conceptual model on the key soil ecosystem processes operating in the Dry Valleys; study various aspects of Antarctic limnetic ecosystems; assess how tourist and scientific activities influence behaviour, levels of reproductive and stress hormones, and reproductive success and return rates of Adèlie penguins; determine the function of the feeding chases in Adelie penguins and assess the consequences of the grounded iceberg off Ross Island on the crèching behaviour of the penguins; and undertake a long-term study on the population dynamics of the Adèlie penguin population of the Ross Sea as a biological indicator of local, regional and global change.
