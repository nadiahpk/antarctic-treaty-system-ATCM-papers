Climate Change: an Antarctic Perspective 
The presentation slides will be available separately on the SCAR web site, at 
www.scar.org/communications/. 
1.	 Based on meteorological observations, the average temperature of the Earth has 
increased by 0.8°C from 1880 to 2005, including an increase of 0.6°C since the 1960s 
(slide 2). 
2.	 During the past 50 years, the temperature increase has been most marked at high 
latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Antarctic Peninsula. No significant 
annual temperature trend can be detected in the interior of the Antarctic continent 
(slide 3). 
3.	 The ocean plays a key role in the global climate system because it stores heat and 
freshwater and moves them around the world. Oceanographic campaigns and models 
are used to show how the global ocean circulation system connects all the ocean 
basins and is involved in the formation of deep ocean waters. This global ocean 
circulation occurs over hundreds of years (slide 4). 
4.	 At a higher level of detail, we see that the Southern Ocean is the place where waters 
from all the ocean basins are mixed. Deep ocean waters are formed around Antarctica. 
These processes import climate signals to Antarctica from the rest of the world, and 
export Antarctic climate signals to the rest of the world. This makes Antarctica an 
integral part of the global climate system (slide 5). 
5.	 Antarctica and the Arctic are the cold points of the climate system. The Antarctic ice 
sheet is the largest freshwater reservoir on Earth, containing 90% of the ice and 70% 
of the total freshwater. If this ice were to melt completely, it would raise sea level by 
around 70 meters. Because the ice sheet is slow to respond to climate change it retains 
a long record of the changes that have affected it. In effect it is the long term memory 
of the climate system (slide 6). 
6.	 The Antarctic ice cap is formed by the successive deposition of snowfall year after 
year. Successive accumulations have built up to depths of several kilometers in the 
interior of Antarctica (slide 7). 
7.	 Since the 1960s, logistics and technologies have been developed and continuously 
improved which make it possible to extract solid cores of ice from drill holes in the ice 
sheet across Antarctica (slide 8). 
8.	 During the process of transition from porous snow to ice, bubbles of air become 
entrapped in the ice. The ice also contains many other physical and chemical records 
of past environmental conditions. Thus, ice cores provide unique climate archives 
providing information on past climate and environmental changes at local, regional 
and global scales. They are also unique because they archive past climate change 
through physical mechanisms – most other paleoclimate archives are obtained through 
biological indicators (fossil organisms in marine or continental sediments) (slide 9). 
9.	 The chemical composition of the water trapped in the ice allows us to estimate past 
temperature changes in Antarctica. The chemical composition of the ice also includes 
information on the impurities transported in the atmosphere. So ice cores enable us to 
reconstruct past changes in the content of dust and aerosols in the atmosphere at both 
regional and hemispheric levels. They make possible reconstructions of the ways in 
which both volcanoes and the sun have forced the atmospheric system to change. The 
impact of human activities on the composition of the atmosphere can also be 
determined. When it comes to human emissions of greenhouse gases, ice cores 
IP 76
provide the single direct record of past atmospheric global composition through the 
greenhouse gas composition of the air bubbles trapped inside the ice (slide 10). 
10. Thanks to logistical support from national operational agencies, several long deep ice 
cores have recently been obtained by drilling at various locations in Antarctica. In the 
search for the longest and most detailed climate records, the European Project for Ice 
Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) reached a depth of 3270 m at Dome C in 2005, and 
2774 m at Kohnen Station in January 2006, while the Japanese reached a depth of 
3029m at Dome F in January 2006. At Dome C, the EPICA ice core provide the oldest 
climate record from Antarctica, extending back to 800 000 years, almost twice as long 
as the record from Vostok. The Dome F ice cores may extent even further back in time 
(slide 11). 
11. The operational support provided by the national Antarctic programs is coordinated 
through COMNAP (Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs) (slide 12). 
12. Deep drilling projects such as EPICA Dome C require intense operational support due 
to climatic and geographic constraints. At Dome C, the operators had to transport a 
total of 1000 tons of equipment over 1200 km, during the 8 to 10 weeks per year 
available for field work. About 28 drillers and scientists were necessary for the drilling 
and in situ processing of the ice cores. EPICA Dome C was supported by 10 national 
programs and the European Commission (5th and 6th PCRDT) (slide 13). The EPICA 
Dome C deep drilling lasted from 1996 to 2005 (slide 14). The ice cores are sampled 
on site and split into working and archive sections (slide 15). 
13.	 Knowing the present-day relationship between the surface temperature and the 
isotopic composition of the snow, we can use isotopic measurements made in ice cores 
to calculate past temperatures (slide 16). 
14. Long Antarctic climate records from Vostok, Dome F and Dome C show the same 
history of Antarctic temperatures. These records confirm that ice ages separated by 
interglacial periods, one of which we are now living in, occurred about once every 
100 000 years (slide 17). 
15. High resolution measurements in ice cores from Greenland show that during glacial 
periods the climate has changed abruptly in what are called “Dansgaard-Oeschger 
events”. Antarctic ice cores now reveal that each abrupt climate change of the north 
Atlantic, seen in Greenland ice, has an Antarctic counterpart. These abrupt changes 
involve abrupt reorganisations of the global deep ocean circulation that connects the 
Arctic and the Antarctic (slide 18). 
16. The temperature change since the last glacial maximum and the current interglacial 
period is estimated to be 9 ± 2°C.at Dome C, corresponding to a maximum warming 
rate of 1.5°C over 1000 years. During the past 400,000 years, changes between ice 
ages and warm periods (interglacials) had a similar amplitude. In the older period 
(from 800,000 to 400,000 years ago), the differences in temperature between ice ages 
and interglacials were smaller. Within the temperature record it is important to note 
the long, warm interglacial that occurred 400,000 years ago, to which we shall return 
later (slide 19). 
17. The occurrence of ice ages is first triggered by changes in the orbit of the Earth around 
the Sun, which modulates the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar 
radiation (slide 20). Secondly there are amplifying feedbacks within the climate 
system caused by changes in the albedo (surface reflection) and in the amounts of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These feedbacks mean that what we see as the 
climate record in ice cores does not simply mimic the Earth’s orbital signal. 
18. Past and future changes in solar irradiance (energy) received by the Earth can be 
precisely calculated for various seasons and various locations. The modern orbital 
IP 76
configuration is very similar to the orbital configuration that occurred 400,000 years 
ago, when the Dome C record showed that there was an unusually long interglacial 
period. Because the astronomical conditions now and 400,000 years ago are similar, 
we would expect that the current warm period should last as long as that one – around 
28,000 years (slide 21). 
19. By directly overlaying the Dome C climate data for the past 30,000 years on top of the 
first 30,000 years of the 400,000 year old interglacial, we can show that the records 
are very similar, as might be expected from the similarity in the annual insolation at 
75° during these two periods of time (slide 22). This period is characterised by 
greenhouse gas contents rather similar to the current interglacial period prior to the 
industrial era. This long-lasting warm period is attributed to a specific characteristic of 
the Earth orbit, with a small eccentricity. Because the same astronomical situation is 
taking place now and in the future tens of thousand of years, it is not expected that the 
current warm period should end due to natural causes. It is expected that the current 
warm period should be a “super interglacial”. 
20. Dome C temperature records exhibit a large change in the intensity of warm periods 
between the periods from 800 000 to 400 000 years and from 400 000 years to 
nowadays. Early warm periods appear as “lukewarm” interglacials. There is no current 
theory for this dramatic change in the intensity of warm periods. They are not 
restricted to Antarctica, as revealed by similar changes in methane and CO2, which 
form parts of the natural global carbon cycle (slide 23). The present (industrial) levels 
of both methane and CO2 are considerably higher than anything experienced in the 
atmosphere of the last 650,000 years (slide 23) 
21. In summary, natural fluctuations of greenhouse gases have been reconstructed from 
Antarctic ice cores back to 650 000 years (current analyses are being conducted to go 
back to 800 000 years at Dome C). The correlation between Antarctic temperature, 
methane and carbon dioxide fluctuations is very strong and constant throughout this 
period. This is good evidence for there being strong feedbacks between climate and 
the carbon cycle. However, we do not yet fully understand the mechanism behind this 
relationship, and that means it is a challenge for climate modellers.  The current level 
of methane in the atmosphere is two times larger than its natural level; the current 
level of carbon dioxide is 30% above the natural levels during warm periods. These 
increases are due to human activities (intensive agriculture and massive use of fossil 
fuels)(slide 24). 
22. Most climate scientists consider that the continued addition of greenhouse gases to the 
atmosphere will cause the climate to warm. We can use state-of-the-art climate models 
to forecast future change based on increases in greenhouses gases. These calculations 
suggest that future climate change in response to increased anthropogenic greenhouse 
gases is likely to be stronger in Antarctica than across the globe (slide 25). 
23. It is instructive to use climate models to see how warming might be spread across 
Antarctica with different amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Typically, a doubling of 
carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere is expected to induce a warming of 
2.5°C on the central Plateau; a quadrupling of carbon dioxide levels is expected to 
produce a warming of 6°C on the central Plateau (slide 26). One way to assess the 
realism of climate models is to test them against known past changes. Climate models 
are able to simulate the order of magnitude of temperature increase from the last 
glacial maximum to present-day (8.5°C). The future temperature change expected 
from a quadrupling of carbon dioxide levels (6°C) is comparable in magnitude to the 
change since the last ice age; however, it would take place 25 times faster than any 
past natural changes (slide 26). 
IP 76
24. The wealth of information from deep ice cores reveals that Antarctica is a crucial area 
for extracting key information about past climate and environmental change. 
Extracting this information required very significant coordinated support from national 
agencies working independently or through COMNAP. Antarctica is experiencing 
large regional changes today that are expected to increase with the increasing human 
emissions of greenhouse gases (+20% since 1990). The Antarctic environment and 
biodiversity are particularly vulnerable to climate change and human pressure (slide 
27). 
25. Key uncertainties still remain on climate change in Antarctica. Large areas of the 
Antarctic continent are still scientifically unknown. We need a better understanding of 
the current, past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice cap, in order to evaluate the 
risk of climate induced sea level rise. The evolution of Antarctic climate at decadal 
time scales, and at the regional scale, remains uncertain, as does the history of the 
climate system prior to 800,000 years (slide 28). 
26. During the 	 next International Polar Year, between 2007 and 2009, intensive 
international efforts will be made to document unexplored areas of Antarctica and the 
Southern Ocean, and to improve understanding of the processes at work within the 
whole system (slide 29). In taking matters forward, we expect to benefit from a new 
coordinated effort to integrate all the national activities in ice core science: 
International Partnership for Ice Core Science (IPICS) (slide 29). 
27. The development of IPICS is motivated by the increasing complexity of challenges in 
ice core science, such as the need for improved spatial coverage, and deeper and older 
cores in more difficult places. This informal international planning group includes 
representatives from 18 nations and is coordinated by Ed Brook (USA) and Eric Wolff 
(UK). Two meetings have been organised in the past 2 years. The project is supported 
by NSF’s Office of Polar Programmes and by the European Polar Board of ESF. It is 
officially endorsed by the IPY committee and is affiliated to PAGES and SCAR (slide 
30). 
28. IPICS has agreed on four targets: (i) the oldest ice core, back to 1.5 million years in 
Antarctica; -ii) a new Greenland ice core extending back to the last interglacial period 
and beyond; (iii) a network of ice cores from north and south covering the past 40 000 
years; (iv) an array of ice cores from ice caps and glaciers covering the past 2000 
years. The idea for the last three of these is to increase the resolution of the ice core 
record in both time and space, so that we can identify the speed, nature, extent and 
timing of climate change with unprecedented accuracy. (Slide 31). 
29. A number of locations have been identified for future work, but substantial areas of 
Antarctica remain un-sampled (slide 32). 
30. It is crucial for the understanding of past climate change to obtain records of 
atmospheric greenhouse composition prior to 1 million years ago. This remote time 
period marked a change from small ice ages occurring around 40 000 years apart to 
large ice ages occurring 100 000 years apart. This transition remains unexplained 
(slide 33). 
31. The take-home message is that given the continuing rise in greenhouse gases we 
expect Antarctica to warm, with profound implications for changes in global sea-level. 
West Antarctica is already vulnerable, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula. East 
Antarctica, however, remains cool for the time being. Our ability to forecast the rates 
and magnitudes of possible change is limited by our numerical models of climate 
change, which in turn are limited by the lack of data on how Antarctic climate has 
evolved and the mechanisms involved. More ice coring will fill that gap, enabling 
forecasts to be refined for the benefit of decision makers. The only place in the world 
IP 76
where we can obtain these data in sufficient amounts with adequate resolution over the 
longest possible time scale is Antarctica. For accurate predictions of Antarctica’s role 
in global climate change we need more investment both in ice core drilling on 
Antarctica and in coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice modelling of Antarctic climate (slide 
34).

Why look for climate change prior to 
1 million years? 
Past climates are essentiel to test and improve the understanding of climate change 
mechanisms including feedbacks between the global carbon cycle and climate 
Need understanding of the shift from small ice ages with periodicities of 40 000 years to 
large ice ages with periodicities of 100 000 years : natural carbon cycle? 
Take home messages 
 Antarctica will continue to warm with profound
implications for global sea level. 
 Our models of future climate change need improving
using targetted ice coring programmes to give more 
reliable predictions on which to base decision making 
 Only in Antarctica can we gain the long term data we
need for this, so more investment is required in ice
coring and climate modeling to ensure accurate
predictions of future change.
