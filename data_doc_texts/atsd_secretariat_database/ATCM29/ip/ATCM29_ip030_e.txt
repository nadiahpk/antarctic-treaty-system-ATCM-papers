The Argentine Antarctic Program in the International Polar Year




The Argentine Antarctic Program in the International Polar Year
It is unquestionable that the 2007-2009 International Polar Year initiative is already a success in the call for submission of research projects and in promoting international cooperation through such projects. The number of EOIs submitted and the extensive work done by the Joint IPY Committee in the selection and organization of these projects clearly attests to this.
Less than a year after the formal beginning of the IPY questions arise on the funding of scientific projects, particularly in the work to be done in Antarctica and the coordination of the necessary logistic efforts to completing them. Although it was clear from the very beginning that funding of the projects should be obtained from the corresponding national agencies (governmental and non-governmental), usually in order to achieve that objective one not only needs to have the scientific basis for the proposals and the background information on all proposing researchers but a proposed expenditure budget (particularly logistic expenses) and their feasibility. These last requirements are closely linked with the availability of resources to operate in Antarctica, which are mostly controlled by the various national Antarctic programs. Therefore, as long as the logistic feasibility is dependant upon the approval and funding of the scientific project, the submission of the project demands a logistic commitment. To this circle of interdependent uncertainties we must add the large number of new projects, their interdisciplinary nature and, especially, their international scope.
As a way to assist in overcoming this situation and as a proactive contribution towards international cooperation in Antarctica, the Argentine Antarctic Program submitted to the last COMNAP meeting (Sofia, Bulgaria 2005) an information paper where they listed the operational capabilities of their bases, ships and aircraft which would operate in Antarctica during the IPY, describing in detail the additional  potential capabilities of them and the possibility to make them available to IPY projects.
At a national level, the Argentine Antarctic Institute promoted and coordinated a joint appeal together with the Ministry for Science and Technology for the funding of IPY projects where the National Antarctic Directorate contributes with the logistic support and the National Agency for Scientific and Technical Promotion provides the necessary money for the development of the projects.
In 1959 the Argentine Republic took part in the International Geophysical Year - IGY with a significant number of scientific activities which were carried out through their logistic means and their scientific bases. Since then, our country has enhanced its capabilities to operate in Antarctica, both on the development of scientific projects as well as in data collection and logistic support operations in these activities.
Thus, within the framework of IPY, the six permanent bases and the possibility of activating many other station bases which belong to Argentina, particularly those located in the Antarctic Peninsula and south of the Weddell Sea, that can be seen as a unique opportunity for the entire Antarctic Scientific Community, not only because of their geographic distribution but because of their ability to collect data, develop scientific experiments and for their continuous use in time as permanent observatories since among them we find the only station that has operated, without interruption, in the Antarctic territory in the last 102 years (Orcadas Base).
