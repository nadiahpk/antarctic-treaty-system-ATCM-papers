IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism
2005-2006 Antarctic Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2005-2006 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. Additional information can be found on line at www.iaato.org. The information is presented on the best available knowledge at the time this document is presented. 
We draw Parties attention to the fact that the “IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2004-05 Antarctic Season” submitted to XXVIII ATCM (Stockholm, 2005) was amended after the conclusion of the meeting as a late Post Visit Site Report was received from a non-IAATO Member who landed an additional 537 passengers. An updated version of the paper can be found on IAATO’s web site (http://www.iaato.org) under the section on “Information Papers”. 
1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
Since IAATO began in 1991, IAATO activities outweighed non-IAATO Member activities overall. More than 95% of all companies operating in Antarctica are members of IAATO. A summary of IAATO Member activities follows:
    • 1,074 clients participated in land-based expeditions.
    • 20,528 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area. Of this total:
        ◦ 19,289 passengers traveled aboard seaborne vessels and landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area
        ◦ 940 passengers traveled aboard seaborne vessels and landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica
        ◦ 88 passengers sailed aboard small sailing vessels and/or yachts
        ◦ 211 passengers participated in air/cruise voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula area departing from South America and landing at King George Island, then embarked a vessel and sailed for six days
    • 4,632 passengers traveled aboard large cruise vessels that were cruise-only (and did not land in the Antarctic Treaty Area).
    • 450 passengers participated in over-flights from South America to the Antarctic Peninsula area aboard aircraft.
    • 715 passengers participated in over-flights to Antarctica from Australia.
    • All operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National authority.  
        1.2 Non-IAATO Operator’s Activities
    • 4,639 passengers traveled aboard three non-IAATO-operated vessels or aircraft, landing passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula area. 
    • An unknown number of passengers traveled on small sailing vessels/yachts. Information pertaining to these vessels was not possible to obtain from either the vessel operators or National authorities.
    • Government-supported tourism activities on ships and aircraft occurred, but information has not been provided to IAATO for activities departing from South Africa and South America.
    • Four tourists participated in a program offered by Uruguay at Artigas Station. Uruguay kindly advised IAATO of its activities at the IAATO 17th Annual General Meeting (Washington D.C., 2006).
    • Several private and some commercial activities were conducted where Advance Notification and Post Visit Site Reports had been filed through National Authorities.  However, information has not been forwarded to IAATO for inclusion in this report. IAATO is concerned about non-Member activities and the need to report accurately on all tourism activities.
    • Several countries did not require Environmental Impact Assessments and/or Post Visit Site Reports from commercial tourist operations to report on their activities. Despite repeated requests by IAATO to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to compile data on all landing and/or cruise information in order to incorporate these numbers into the annual tourism statistics, the required Post Visit Site Reports were not forthcoming; therefore the numbers of passengers from these activities are noted as estimates or approximate where hard data was not available.

        1.3 Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities 
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B., Naiad, hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for a minimum of seven years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the 1960’s. A brief summary of the season, including an "Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2005-2006,” and “IAATO Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism 2006-2007,” are appended as Appendix A and Appendix C, respectively, which provide further details of the operators (IAATO and non-IAATO), vessels, activities and numbers.
Based on information returned to IAATO in annual reports or in the Post Visit Site Reports from the 2005-2006 season it is estimated that at least 26,245 passengers landed in the Antarctic on private sector seaborne and land-based expeditions. 
Most, but not all, commercial tour companies during the 2004-2005 season were located in the States of Contracting Parties.
    2.0  Commercial Seaborne Tourism – IAATO Members and Non-members of IAATO
2.1	Seasonal Estimates
IAATO can account for 25,167 passengers landed in the Antarctic Treaty Area on 44 commercially-organized tour vessels and small sailing vessels and/or yachts who reported their activities from October 2005 to March 2006. This number includes Members and non-IAATO members. This represents a 12% increase over the 2004-2005 season where a total of 22,297 ship-based passengers were reported traveling aboard 32 commercially-organized tour vessels and small sailing vessels and/or yachts. 
IAATO Members operated all but three of the tour vessels that sailed during the 2005–2006 season. Since 2001, IAATO’s Bylaws have stated that IAATO vessels carrying more than 500 passengers cannot land passengers ashore and that stringent landing restrictions are placed on vessels carrying more than 200 passengers at specific landing sites due to environmental considerations. Two of the vessels capable of carrying more than 500 passengers operated by non-IAATO Members landed more than 500 passengers each departure. These companies do not intend to join IAATO.

Note: Table 1 is based on data provided by companies who submitted Post Visit Site Reports and from other sources where available.
2.2	The vast majority of commercially-operated voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from late October to March), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from Port Stanley, Punta Arenas, Puerto Williams, Puerto Montt, Valparaiso, Puerto Madryn, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. 
The three large cruise vessels ( Regal Princess, Rotterdam and Prinsendam) operated by IAATO Members who each carry more than 500 passengers and conducted cruise-only operations visited the Antarctica Peninsula area for approximately 72-96 hours on each voyage and carried a total of 4,632 passengers. 
IAATO cautions users who compare data from year to year without looking at individual vessels and comparing it to reports from Antarctic Treaty Parties’ exchange of information. IAATO membership has grown over the years by some sailing vessel/yachts that have been sailing in Antarctica for many years.

3.0	Commercial Antarctic Small Sailing Vessel and/or Yacht Activities (operated by non-IAATO Members)
Based on information received by IAATO it is estimated that at least 200 passengers were reported to have traveled to the Antarctic Treaty Area aboard 20 or more commercially-operated small sailing vessels and/or yachts during the 2005-2006 season. IAATO has provided in this report information on its vessels. For non-Member vessels this information may be found under the Exchange of Information submitted by each Antarctic Treaty Party who permits or authorizes the vessel or company. 
3.1	IAATO Commercial Small Sailing Vessels and/or Yachts with fare-paying passengers include Pelagic, Pelagic Australis, Golden Fleece, Tooluka, Australis, Kotick, Le Sourire, Santa Maria and Vaihéré.

A partial list of Non-Member Private Luxury Yachts, small ships and/or Small Sailing Vessels visiting Antarctica during the 2005-2006 season include: Patagonia Lady, Giant, Ada, Valhalla, Antipode, Sarah Worwerk, Spirit of Sydney, Andri Apostle, DAP Mares, and others. The vessel Giant’s operations raised a number of gaps that exist in the Antarctic Treaty System.
IAATO would like to see Antarctic Treaty Parties permitting small sailing vessels and/or yacht operations to encourage the use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO requests copies whenever possible of all Post Visit Site reports for non-IAATO member companies so that tourism data can be compiled on all landing sites and more accurately reflect overall numbers from tourism activities. This will also assist in compiling data for use in furthering the understanding of potential cumulative impacts from these activities. This same request was also made at ATCM XXV, ATCM XXVI and ATCM XXVII, and ATCM XXVIII, but those reports have not yet been forthcoming. 
3.2	Activities Conducted from Expedition Cruise Vessels
All activities are approved through the Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documentation submitted in advance of the season to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

	3.2.1	Camping in the Peninsula
Six IAATO Members conducting traditional seaborne tourism to the Antarctic Peninsula offered short overnight stays in conjunction with the cruise. Camping provides an excellent opportunity for tourists to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica, separate from being on the ship. This activity has taken place for at least ten years in the Peninsula region. Campsites are generally located at least 450 ft. from nesting birds, including penguins, and located on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites. Each campsite is used for no more than a few nights per season. Toilets are generally taken ashore; human waste is returned to the ship and meals are only eaten on board the ship.
	3.2.2	Climbing and Kayaking from Ships in the Peninsula Area
Climbing and kayaking have proven to be successful activities for more than nine years in the Antarctic Peninsula area.
3.2.3	SCUBA Diving
SCUBA diving has been offered on six IAATO Member-operated vessels for more than seven years. 
3.3.4	Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
An ROV has been used by one IAATO Member for at least four years. The ROV is used for educational purposes. Video footage is taken by the ROV and aired aboard ship for passengers to be able to experience first-hand the underwater sea life. 
3.3.5	Helicopter Operations 
Helicopter operations were conducted by two IAATO Members during the 2005-2006 season. Helicopter operations have taken place since the 1992-1993 season.
		3.3.6	Hovercraft Operation
One company successfully used a Hovercraft in the Ross Sea area during the 2005-2006 season.
4.0	Commercial Land-based Tourism Activities
4.1 	IAATO member Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below) operated their programs out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the 20th consecutive season. ALE carried a total of 212 clients, 50 government and VIP personnel, 77 staff and guides, and 24 aircrew. 

Activities included the operation of standard programs, organization and operation of expeditions, services for private expeditions and support for government activities. ALE’s operations are summarized below.

ALE Aircraft Operations:
    • An Ilyushin-76 aircraft was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, fuel and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills for a total of fifteen flights.
    • Two ski-equipped Twin-Otter aircraft were used for flights in Antarctica and to support medical evacuation throughout the Antarctic season. 

The Patriot Hills Camp opened 04 November 2005 and closed on 28 January 2006.

ALE organized, operated or provided logistics support for the following expeditions and the respective number of individuals:

ALE continued to improve its oil spill and waste management procedures. A revised Oil Spill Plan was implemented during the 2005-2006 season that included a much enhanced supply of spill clean-up equipment in Antarctica. Greater vehicle activity away from Patriot Hills also required increased oil spill equipment. There were no significant oil spills or other incidents to report. Any contaminated snow was collected and removed from Antarctica.
New waste management procedures were also introduced during the 2005-2006 season. As in previous years, all waste generated at Patriot Hills, except gray water, was removed from the Antarctic, as was all waste generated at Vinson Massif and by expeditions, except human waste and gray water. Revised environmental guidelines for Vinson were implemented this season that included a trial using WagBags for trips on the mountain. WagBags were also tested during one of the Last Degree expeditions. These bags are used for collecting human waste and proved partially successful. As a result of the new Vinson waste guidelines, use of WagBags, a clean-up by ALE staff and enhanced awareness by clients on the mountain, the route is in a better state than it has been for some years.
ALE employs experienced staff and guides, many of whom have worked previously at Patriot Hills and other locations to be visited. Staff assist in the preparation of policies and ensure their implementation in Antarctica. Ninety percent of staff has previous Antarctic experience.
Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) were again deployed at locations up to 200 km inland from Patriot Hills to provide weather data.
Government Activities Supported by ALE
Requests from National Operators, research institutions and universities resulted in ALE providing support for up to 50 scientists and logistic staff and a considerable number of flights. Research groups and their logistic support from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Bristol University, Centro de Estudios Científicos (CECS), GANOVEX9, National Science Foundation (NSF) and Technische Universität Hamburg-Harburg visited Patriot Hills and were accommodated at the camp for various periods. Two of these groups (BAS and NSF) were supported by flight activity. 
At the request of NSF a groomed skiway suitable for landing ski-equipped Hercules aircraft was prepared and used on three occasions for the transfer of research teams, cargo and fuel. Twin Otter aircraft from BAS, GANOVEX9 and NSF visited Patriot Hills, using the normal skiway.
CECS and Bristol University were supported on a 1000-km snowmobile and tractor traverse to Lake Ellsworth using ALE vehicles. Ice movements were measured over the entire route and the location and approximate dimensions of the Lake Ellsworth complex was measured by ground radar.
Three observers from Chile Region XII International Police and DGAC (airport authority in Punta Arenas) visited Patriot Hills.
Expeditions Supported by ALE
ALE client numbers for the 2005-2006 season increased by about 11.5% over the 2004-2005 season. The guide-to-client ratio for the season was 1:5. New programs for the season were a Marathon and Ultra-marathon (100 km) run over a fully groomed course laid out around Patriot Hills. 
There were no independent expeditions during the 2005-2006 season and all expeditions formed part of ALE’s advertised programs. 

4.2	Air/ Land-based Activities Conducted by Aerovias DAP and DAP Mares

4.2.1	Aerovias DAP (IAATO Provisional Member)
In 2005-2006, there were 20 flights operated by Aerovias DAP in either a King Air or Dash 7 aircraft carrying a total of 862 clients, including station personnel on station visits and extended walks. DAP offered both a one-day flight seeing and landing at King George Island and an overnight program where clients stay on King George Island in DAP’s land-based facilities. Clients accompanied by a guide visit Frei/Marsh, Bellingshausen and Great Wall Stations, and surrounding wildlife areas if time permits. DAP also provided the Emergency Medical and Evacuation Response plan for IAATO Members.
4.2.2	DAP Mares (Non-IAATO Member)
DAP Mares offered several land- and ship-based tourist activities including dropping a group of Ham radio operators at Peter I Island for 10 days and a group of “runners” who ran races/marathons at Esperanza Station, Maxwell Bay area and Whalers Bay. Clients stayed at Esperanza Station for part of their trip. The group leader brought a 4-wheel ATV vehicle ashore for all landings and drove at each landing site. A Post Visit Site Report has not been provided for the “runners”.
5.0	Air Operations – Flight Seeing 

5.1	IAATO Member LAN Airlines operated nine overflights carrying 450 passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area in a 60-passenger capacity Boeing 737-200 during the 2005-2006 season. 

The flying routes varied according to weather conditions but basically were conducted as follows:
    • From King George Island to Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and Deception Islands (South Shetland Islands) and return.
    • From King George Island and the Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell Sea (in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands) with an overflight near Marambio Station and return.

Numerous flights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate from Punta Arenas but information on these flights prior to 2003-2004 have been difficult to obtain. 

These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers and independent travelers calling at Punta Arenas.  

5.2	During the 2005-2006 season IAATO Member Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia, operated two Antarctic daytime sightseeing flights, lasting approximately 11-12 hours in duration, operating out of Australia aboard a Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the tenth consecutive season. 

A total of 715 passengers participated in two flights. In addition, the aircraft carried a total of 132 crew members during the season. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 78 flights carrying nearly 28,572 passengers since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The flight itineraries primarily operate along the northern Victoria Land coast, and the Oates, George V and Adélie Coasts. Croydon’s staff provides a full in-flight lecture and education program utilizing at least three experienced lecturers and at least six videos. A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground-to-air interviews are conducted with staff members at Australian and occasionally at Italian bases.

6.0	Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2006-2007 Season
Appendix C illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that are expected to occur during the 2006-2007 season. This is an estimate based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat. The histogram in Appendix B illustrates estimated and actual tourism figures for seaborne and land-based passengers as compiled since the 1992-1993 season.
For the 2006-2007 season seaborne or ship-based tourism will once again include the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B, Naiad, hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV.
6.1	According to estimates provided to IAATO by tour operators, during the 2006-2007 season 27,575 seaborne and small sailing vessels and/or yacht passengers are expected to land in Antarctica on commercially-organized tour vessels and 1,050 on land-based expeditions. Another 7,500 are anticipated on cruise-only programs and 1,600 on overflights. See Appendix C for a complete breakdown of Member and Non-member activities.

6.2	Non-IAATO member activities are of concern to IAATO. At least three of the 500+ capacity passenger vessel operators plan to land passengers in Antarctica over the course of nine departures. These nine departures by ships have the potential to land at least 500-550 passengers per voyage. 

6.3	Aerovias DAP is planning on flying passengers from Punta Arenas to Frei/Marsh Station on King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at Frei/Marsh. In addition, there are five fly/cruise programs that include a flight from Punta Arenas to King George Island where passengers embark a ship (at Frei), sail and make landings in the Antarctic Peninsula for five days before flying back to Punta Arenas.

6.4	IAATO has not been informed of possible activities in Dronning Maud Land during the 2005-2006 or 2006-2007 seasons.

6.5	Some National Program vessels carry fare-paying passengers. National Programs are encouraged to report their passenger numbers and activities if they are landing at typical tourist sites so IAATO can attempt to account for the “footprint” and address cumulative impact issues. (Post Visit Site Reports should also be compiled for these activities.) 

    7.0 Antarctic Tourism Trends

7.1	A trends chart showing the change in tourism from the 1992-1993 season to the 2005-2006 season can be found in Appendix B of this paper.  

	7.2	The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (http://www.iaato.org) under the category of “Tourism Statistics”: 

    • Tourists by Nationality (Landed)
    • Tourists by Nationality (Air and Cruise)
    • Tourists by Nationality (All)
    • Tourist Nationalities by Vessel
    • Trends 1992-2006
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per site per vessel-All Antarctic Sites (6 Sheets in Total)
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per Site per Vessel-Continental Sites, 
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site per Vessel
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-Peninsula Sites and
    • Number of Visits per Site/per Activity.

	7.3	IAATO assumes that Antarctic tourism will continue to grow both in seaborne activities and to a lesser degree by land-based activities. The increase in numbers, however, does not necessarily reflect direct or significant environmental impacts. IAATO is committed to effectively managing Antarctic tourism given the yearly increase of tourism.
Tourism in the Ross Sea region will decrease slightly during the 2006-2007 season, and there is little evidence that there will be significant increases in years to come. This is due to a limited operational season, and potentially restricted access to the Ross Sea and Continental area of the Antarctic and the Sub-Antarctic islands.
8.0	Conclusion
In practice and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether or not associated with IAATO – are included in the exchange of emergency contact information, ship scheduling, etc. Government and National Program representatives and prospective IAATO Members are encouraged to participate in open sessions of IAATO’s General Meeting where IAATO Bylaws, operating procedures and policies are developed, as well as where obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System are discussed.  IAATO’s 18th Annual General Meeting will be held in Hobart in June 2007.
IAATO-Member activities continue to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. IAATO as an organization is focused on minimizing environmental impacts and consequently evaluates all relevant tourist activities. 
IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent as not all tourist activities are presently being reported by those conducting these activities.

Additional Note on Non-IAATO Vessels:

During the season there were both small and large luxury yachts that sailed to Antarctica that were not part of the IAATO network. Information on these vessels should be obtained through the Antarctic Treaty Parties Exchange of Information. A request was made for copies of the applicable Post Visit Site Reports but none was received, therefore they were not included in this overview.
