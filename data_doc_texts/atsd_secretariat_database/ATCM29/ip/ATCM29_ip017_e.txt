Annual Report Pursuant to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty


    1. NOTIFICATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 17 OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
        1.1. Notification of the measures taken pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Protocol.

The Republic of South Africa has taken the following measures to ensure compliance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty:

    • Adoption of the Antarctic Treaties Act (Act No. 60 of 1996) on 1 November 1996 (Government Gazette, Vol. 376, No. 17536).
    • 
    • Adoption of the Antarctic Treaties Act, 1996 (Act No. 60 of 1996), Amendment of Schedule 1 of the Act on 16 May 1997 (Government Gazette, Vol. 383, No. 17993, Regulation Gazette No. 5926).

The Antarctic Treaties Act came into force on 1 November 1996, and presently regulations for further implementation of the Act are being developed. Procedures are currently being followed to ensure Parliamentary approval of Annex VI of the Protocol and the relevant legal instruments.

Operations at the SANAE IV Base, Earth Sciences camps, transport routes, Emergency Base, Bukta and on supply ships are governed by an Environmental Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS) shaped by the requirements contained in the Environmental Protocol.

An annual environmental audit of SANAP activities was undertaken during the 2005/6 summer season.

A fuel spill at the SANAE IV Base reported on 16 July 2005, initially incorrectly suggested a spill involving approximately 100 000 litres. The cause of the spill (human error) was investigated during the 2005/6 summer season and after thorough calculation was found to have not exceeded 20 940 litres. A partial (approx. 50%) clean-up of the effected area was undertaken immediately by the over-wintering team during the year. During the past summer season a dedicated team continued the clean-up effort. A third and final clean-up will be undertaken during the coming season. A comprehensive report on the completed clean-up exercise will be tabled at next years meeting.

        1.2. Contingency plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol

South Africa established an Oil Spill Contingency Plan for the South African National Antarctic Programme’s (SANAP) research and supply vessel, the mv SA Agulhas, and its Antarctic Base, SANAE IV, based on the guidelines as set out by the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP), which has been effective since 23 October 1996. A review of the plan was undertaken during 2005. 

The document was updated and expanded. Stakeholders were consulted and re-briefed. Emergency drills in Antarctica are planned for the near future, hopefully during the 2006/7 summer season. This exercise coincided with a comprehensive review of all SANAP’s fuel/lubricant and chemical handling systems, procedures and practices.



    2. REPORT PURSUANT TO ANNEX I, ARTICLE 6(1) OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL

        2.1. Procedures to consider the environmental impacts of proposed activities in Antarctica (Annex I, Article 6 (1a))

The procedures laid down in Annex I of the Protocol are adhered to by South Africa, and a detailed description of the process to be followed will be incorporated in the Regulations that are being developed.

        2.2. List of Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEE) developed in accordance with Article 2 and decisions taken (Annex I, Article 6 (1b))

None.

        2.3. Significant information obtained, and any action taken in consequence thereof, from procedures put in place in accordance with Annex I, Article 2 (2) and 5 of the Protocol (Annex I, Article 6 (1c))

Antarctic activities are monitored by South Africa in accordance with an EHSMS. An annual audit of environment-related issues is also carried out in continuation of the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) compiled for the SANAE IV base, including ship and helicopter operations and over-snow transport.

    3. REPORT PURSUANT TO ANNEX II, ARTICLE 6 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL

        3.1. Number and nature of permits issued under Annex II of the Protocol during the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 (Annex II, Article 6 (2) of the Protocol)

	None.

    4. REPORT PURSUANT TO ANNEX III, ARTICLE 9 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL

        4.1. Waste Management Plans prepared in accordance with Annex III, Article 8 of the Protocol  (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol)

	Since the commencement of the construction phase of SANAE IV in 1991/92, South Africa 	introduced a Waste Management Plan which is available from:
	Director: Antarctica and Islands
	Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 
	P O Box 8172
	Roggebaai
	8012
	SOUTH AFRICA

        4.2. Report on implementation of Waste Management Plan (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol)

Since 1991/92, South Africa’s Waste Management Plan has been fully implemented and all the waste generated during expeditions are separated and categorised according to the Plan and retrograded out of Antarctica. All household waste is sorted into categories of glass, metal, kitchen food waste, chemicals, oils and medical waste and is sealed in drums. All paper and plastics are compacted into bales and stored in steel orange containers. 
Building waste from the construction phase was loaded into plywood and timber crates. The following was back-loaded and returned to South Africa following the 2005/2006 summer season:

        4.3. Inventory of past activities in accordance with Annex III, Article 8 (3) of the Protocol (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol)

An inventory of past activities was drafted during 2005 (See Annexure A). Of the 50 sites identified only 3 required clean-up action. Two of the 3 sites were cleaned-up during the 2005/6 summer season. The last remaining site (SANAE IV) is subject to an annual clean-up at the end of each season. The final phase of the 2005 oil spill clean-up will be completed this coming season.

    5. REPORT PURSUANT TO ANNEX V, ARTICLE 10 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL

        5.1. Number and nature of permits issued under Annex V of the Protocol during the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 (Annex V, Article 10 (2) of the Protocol)
