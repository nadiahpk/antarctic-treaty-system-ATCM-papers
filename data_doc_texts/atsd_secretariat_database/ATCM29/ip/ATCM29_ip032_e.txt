Chinese Antarctic Environmental Report 
(2005-2006)
1. Introduction
On 2005/06 season, 144 people, including scientists, logistic men and sailors, went to Antarctica. Among them, 25 peoples went to the Great Wall Station and 12 peoples are overwintering there, 49 peoples went to the Zhongshan Station and 18 peoples are overwintering there; 70 peoples were on board of “Xuelong” for Prydz Bay investigation and logistical support.
The R/V “Xuelong” left Shanghai on 18 Nov. 2005 and arrived at Zhongshan station on Dec. 17, 2005. After the unloading of cargos and fuels and investigation of the Prydz Bay, it came back to China on Mar. 28, 2006.
2. Main activities
2.1 Great Wall Station
Great Wall Station is located on King George Island of the South Shetlands Islands at 62º12’59.32”S, 58º57’51.37”W. The station was established in the summer 1984/85 season and has operated continuous since, to facilitate the conduct of year-round scientific research activity by the Chinese Antarctic Program. Great Wall Station is composed of 10 permanent buildings and can accommodate approximately 50 personnel in summer and 20 personnel in winter.

    • Surveys on Dalk Glacier, Antenna Fields for HF radars
    • ntegrated expedition of the Grove Mountains areas
2.3 “Xuelong” Antarctic cruise
The main tasks of R/V Xuelong were as follows:
    • Logistics and transportation for Zhongshan Station
    • Remove of rubbishes and wastes from Zhongshan Station
    • Oceanographic investigation (hydrology, chemistry, biology, etc) in Prydz Bay 
3. The environmental impact assessment
The Madrid Protocol, in Article 3, establishes a number of environmental principles which can be considered a guide to environmental protection in Antarctica and its dependent and associated ecosystems. Among such principles, those stated under paragraph C express the necessity of collecting sufficient information “to allow prior assessments of, and informed judgments about, their possible impacts on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and on the value of Antarctica for the conduct of scientific research”.
According to the Madrid Protocol, impacts shall be evaluated by taking into account three levels of significance:
    • less than minor or transitory impact;
    • minor or transitory impact; or
    • more than minor or transitory impact.
The environmental impacts of all the Chinese Antarctic activities had been considered before their commencement .The IEEs were requested on most of  the 2005/2006 Chinese Antarctic activities and evaluated by a group of specialists in July 2005. The activities which are reasonable and have less than a minor and transitory impact on the environment could be carried out in the Antarctic.
4. Measures of environmental protection
4.1. Education and training
During the organization of the team of the 22nd Chinese Antarctic Research Expedition, all the members, including scientists, logistic men and sailors, were trained for the protection of the Antarctic environment. 
The environmental officials at the stations and on the vessel were appointed to be responsible for the environmental management and assisting the chief of the station and the captain to deal with environmental accident, including monitoring the state of the equipment used for environmental protection, the sewage treating system, the incinerator, waste material management, etc.
4.2 Oil transportation
The Oil Spill Contingency Plan was evaluated by the specialists and considered available in practice. The specialists also recommended that necessary measures be taken to prevent oil spill accident during the fuel transportation from the ship to shore.
400 tons of fuel was successfully transported from “Xuelong” to the Zhongshan station through pipe. All the valves, pipes and equipment were examined ahead of time. The operators both at the station and the vessel were asked to have good cooperation and to take all the necessary and careful steps to avoid oil spill accident.
4.3 Maintenance of the stations
Main activities, such as the repainting of the buildings, were asked for IEEs. Only when the impact of the activity was less than minor or transitory, they were allowed to carry out at the station.
The maintaining work of the generators, vehicles and other instruments were done in doors. Preventive measures were taken to avoid oil leakage and all the waste oil was stored to bring back to China.
During the repainting of the buildings, peoples were asked to operate carefully to avoid the paint drops to splash down to the ground.
People at the stations were organized to “clean” the station environment, especially to clean up all waste materials around the buildings. 
4.4 Scientific research
Each research project was demanded to have an IEE when it was submitted to the CAA except the routine observation project. 
Scientists were asked not to disturb the plants or penguins when they were in the field. All the waste produced during the research should be collected and brought back to the station. 
Approved by the CAA, the scientists took samples from snow-ice, soil, seawater, and freshwater, and no mosses or lichens were sampled on this season. The impacts of these samplings were very small and transitory.
A team of 11 people went to the Glove Mountains by 3 snow–vehicles, conducting study on geology, geodesy, glaciology and meteorites discovery. The main impact on the environment aroused from the discharge of waste gas from vehicles. All the wastes and rubbishes were demanded to bring back to the Zhongshan Station. 
4.5 Waste management and disposal
Under the conduction of the environmental official, the waste materials at the station were divided into different category. Combustible material was to be burned in the incinerator. Other waste material, including waste oil, plastic, cans and batteries was gathered into containers to be transported back to China.
All the medical and chemical wastes were requested to be collected in the vessels to be transported back to China. On 2005/2006 season, no radiate material was used.
5．Monitoring 
The south-western part of King George Island---Fildes Peninsula is a large ice-free area with important natural, scientific, aesthetic and historic values, and is intensively used for scientific, logistic and tourism activities. Based on its intensively human activities and the fact of quick warming in this region, it becomes one of the most fragile environments in the Antarctic. The monitoring of the environment is imperative in order to protect the environment of this region.
China had carried out some ecological and environmental monitoring programs near the station and its adjacent waters (Great Wall Bay and Ardley Bay) since the foundation of the Great Wall Station on 1984/85 season, but they were all not the long-term programs. Cooperated with Germany research group, the monitoring of bird populations and their environment situation in this region has being conducted since 2001. On season 2004/05, China began a long-term monitoring program of the environment and ecosystem at Great Wall Station and its adjacent coastal seas.
On 2005/06 season, the monitoring work of water quality was done at Great Wall station. The same monitoring activity is going to be carried out at Zhongshan Station in the next season.
5.1 Sewage water
Three monitoring sites were chosen at the Great Wall Station (one station was near sewage point, and other two were chosen for comparison) for monitoring the nutrient levels. 
Table 1: The nutrient levels of the seawater at Great Wall Station.

For the nutrient concentrations listing at table 1, concentrations of N [(NO3-+NO2-)-N] and P (PO43--P) changes very little between the sewage points and afar away seawater, so there is less than minor or transitory impact on the water environmental of Antarctica.
5.2 Fresh water
Two lakes were chosen at Great Wall Station to monitoring the nutrient levels, and classified the waters according to GB 3838-2002 (Attachment C). At Great Wall Station, the monitoring lakes were West Lake (to supply water for Great Wall Station) and Yan’ou Lake (near oil storage place).

From the data listing at the table 2, the classes of the freshwater are far less than Class I of the groundwater of the lakes according to GB 3838-2002, means that there is almost no pollution in these areas.
6. Environmental accident
No environmental accident occurred.
7. Future plan
    • According to the project of “The Improvement of the Chinese Antarctic Expedition Abilities”, the Great Wall and Zhongshan Stations will be reconstructed in the coming years. The old sewage treatment systems 、incinerators and oil tanks at both stations are going to be updated. It will effectively decrease the impact of maintaining stations to the environment.
    • In order to protect the environment more effectively, China will strengthen the environmental protection measures and long-term environmental monitoring activities at both Great Wall Station and Zhongshan Station. 
    • Chinese side will promote the cooperation of the environmental monitoring among research groups on the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island.
