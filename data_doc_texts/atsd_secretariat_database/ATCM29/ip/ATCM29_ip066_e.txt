Brief Update on the Antarctic Peninsula Landing Site Visits 
and Site Guidelines
Information Paper submitted by IAATO
Peninsula Landing Site Use
IAATO’s Overview of Tourism 2005-2006 (ATCM XXIX IP) details the Antarctica wide levels of reported visitor activity of IAATO members and some non member activities. 
As in years past, the majority of this reported activity (90%) was traditional shipborne tourism – with landings – to the Antarctic Peninsula.  While there was only a small increase in the number of ships used for this form of tourism during the 2005-2006 season (from 27 to 30) these ships appeared to be making more voyages, hence the increase in number of visitors and landings (Fig.1).
During this season, landings continued to concentrate on a very few sites, with 30 sites recieving 85% of the visits and only 6 sites recieving 37% of all visits. The 20 most visited sites (75% of all landings) – not including those from yachts – are shown in Table 1. The season runs from late October until late March, four and a half months total, with each visit lasting 1-3 hours on average.

Site Guidelines
Throughout the CEP ICG Site Guideline review period between July 2005 and April 2006 , IAATO hoped agreement could be reached so that the long term goal was to have a single set of site guidelines. The reformatted guidelines as tabled in ATCM XXIX WP1 are welcomed as an important step forward in visitor management at these landing sites. It is understood that as a package, these guidelines portray a wide range of management tools that can be modified, applied and reviewed as required. 
On the basis that these reformatted guidelines will be adopted by ATCM XXIX, IAATO intends to not only adopt them into our current practices and pre season planning, but also to use these reformatted guidelines as a ‘recipe’ to update the remaining sites currently covered by the 2003 IAATO Site Specific Guidelines. In addition two further sites, Brown Bluff and Useful Island will have guidelines drawn up for visitors. A full list of these sites, in order of percieved priority, is given in Appendix A, and we would note that for three of these sites, Halfmoon Island, Almirante Brown and Snow Hill Island, IAATO would welcome collaboration with Argentina.  
It is estimated that it will take a maximum of two years to complete these site guidelines revisions. In the interim, IAATO’s own site specific guidelines will remain part of our operating procedures, in particular with regard to the restrictions on ship catagories used at specific sites.
