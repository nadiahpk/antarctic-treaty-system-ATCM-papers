Research Program of Participation of the Russian Federation in holding the International Polar Year (2007-2008)




Research Program of Participation of the Russian Federation in holding the International Polar Year (2007-2008)
This program was prepared in compliance with the Plan of Actions of the Russian Organizing Committee of the International Polar Year (ROC IPY) that was considered and approved by the Marine Board under the Russian Federation Government in 2005. The Program is being implemented taking into account the interests of the Russian Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Roshydromet), Russian Academy of Science (RAS), Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Ministry of the Economical Development and Trade of Russia, Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) of Russia, Ministry for Education and Science of Russia, Ministry for Defense of Russia, Ministry of Transport of Russia, Ministry of Agriculture of Russia, Ministry of the Regional Development of Russia and some other agencies and non-governmental organizations (Polar Foundation, Association of Indigenous Small Peoples of the North, Siberia and Far East of the Russian Federation, etc.) based on the aims and goals of the federal and departmental programs.
The connection of this program with the effective federal and regional dedicated programs is determined by the provisions of the Concept for holding the International Polar Year adopted by the decision of the Scientific Council of RAS on the study of the Arctic and the Antarctic of 23 April 2003 and the order of the Government of the Russian Federation of 19 November 2004 No. 1499-r.
The Program takes into account the objectives of departmental dedicated programs, regional programs and of the international programs and projects. It is based on 162 proposals of scientific projects received from the research institutions of the federal bodies of executive power and the Russian Academy of Science, among them 104 projects being devoted to the Arctic and 17 to the Antarctic issues and 41 – to the bi-polar problems.
For the Russian Federation, the priority practical measures to achieve the goal of the IPY 2007/08 include:
    • upgrading and development of the system of coverage of ice, hydrometeorological, geological and geophysical conditions using satellite, specialized automated technical facilities and the existing ground-based observation system in the Arctic and the Antarctic;
    • development and improvement of the system of climatic monitoring and environmental state monitoring in the polar regions;
    • undertaking complex high-latitudinal expeditions in the Arctic and improvement of activity of the Russian Antarctic Expedition.
    • The main objectives are to:
    • determine current and estimate future climate change in the polar regions and their manifestations in the natural complexes of the Arctic and the Antarctic;
    • develop the technologies of monitoring and predicting the processes in the atmosphere, ionosphere, and cryosphere and in the marine environment of high-latitudinal areas;
    • determine the anthropogenous and natural changes in the environmental state and their influence on the ecosystems of polar regions;
    • develop the recommendations for nature protection activity under the conditions of changing climate and the environmental state in the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The coordinated observations in the Arctic and the Antarctic using the existing monitoring systems, conducting special experiments onboard marine vessels, at stations and bases and applying self-contained observation facilities and satellite sounding systems will serve as a practical basis for addressing the objectives of the IPY 2007/08.
The scientific basis of the participation of Russia in the IPY 2007/08 is the federal dedicated programs in the framework of which the studies of the Arctic and the Antarctic are carried out. These include the Federal Programs “World Ocean” and “Environment and the Natural Resources of Russia” and the Federal Research Program “Studies and Developments in the Priority Directions of Science and Technology”.
During the IPY 2007/08 it is foressen to:
    • obtain a synoptic estimate of the state of large-scale polar processes, influencing polar and global climate with the use of operating drifting stations, airborne and shipborne expeditions, satellite systems, drifting and stationary buoys, etc.;
    • expand a program of seasonal meteorological, glaciological, oceanographic and biological studies at polar stations, seasonal field bases and research vessels of Roshydromet, RAS and MNR of Russia;
    • investigate meso- and small-scale polar processes, subjected to the impact of climatic changes and participating in the formation of feedback relations in the polar part of the climatic system (albedo, inversions in the atmosphere, deep convection in the open ocean and at the continental slope, surges of glaciers, etc.);
    • perform a complex of geophysical observations of the processes in the Earth’s polar caps influencing climate and the environment, including observations of short-term variations and long-term trends of solar activity influencing geophysical and atmospheric processes in polar regions, and control of the electromagnetic contamination of the ionosphere and assessment of its consequences;
    • assess the current state of land polar components of the cryosphere (glaciers and permafrost) and promote expansion of their studies, in particular for collection of paleoclimatic information and prediction of evolution at different scenarios of climate changes;
    • estimate the state of the polar ecosystems under the conditions of changing climate and anthropogenic impacts and develop the recommendations for nature protection activity;
    • improve and develop the existing systems of monitoring and technologies of predicting the processes in the ionosphere, ocean and the cryosphere;
    • contribute to large-scale international projects and programs of climatic and environmental studies of polar regions, carried out by the international organizations in which Russia participates;
    • develop the recommendations for further social-economic development of the Arctic region.
Special emphasis should be given to the system of observations in the Arctic region.
For the last 10 years the Russian observation system of climatic monitoring in the Arctic has significantly decreased and many information sources based on operation of drifting stations, high-latitudinal stations, high-latitudinal air- and shipborne expeditions, patrol ships and cross-country expeditions are not any more in existence. The stationary network of hydrometeorological observations has decreased 3-fold and included in 2002 only 45 polar stations.
The main program directions were adopted:
    1) Climate and paleo-climate
    2) Upper atmosphere and near-earth space
    3) Free and surface atmosphere
    4) Marine environment of polar oceans and seas and sea ice
    5) Water and land surface and mouths of rivers of polar regions: ice conditions and floods
    6) Soils, cryosphere of the land of polar regions, glaciation and permafrost
    7) Assessment and prediction of environmental pollution of polar regions and its influence on the ecosystems of polar regions
    8) State of the populations and their response to climatic and anthropogenic changes in the ecosystems of polar regions
    9) Upgrading and development of the system of coverage with ice, hydrometeorological and geophysical situation using satellite and special automated technical facilities and the existing system of ground-based observations in the Arctic and the Antarctic
    10) Integrated observation systems
    11) Creation of the new high-quality poly-disciplinary information fund on the Earth’s polar regions
    12) Development of the system of cartographic-geodetic and navigation support for the territory of the Arctic zone and transportation system including the Northern Sea Route
    13) Problems of the population of polar regions
    14) Assessment of social-economic consequences of the environmental state changes of polar regions, influencing primarily the life activity of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, for provision of the rational nature use and other types of activity
    15) Working out the recommendations for taking into account the conditions of changing climate and the state of the environment in the interests of sustainable social-economic development in the Arctic and provision of the presence of Russia in the Antarctic
    16) Creation of the methodological support and realization of the education programs in order to train masters, candidates and doctors of science on the problems of polar regions
    17) Creation of the methodological support and realization of the education programs in order to increase the qualification of specialists on different problems of polar countries
    18) Organization and conduct of events for implementing different forms of scientific interaction and dissemination of knowledge.
Studies in the aforementioned directions foresee the implementation of special full-scale expedition studies, and office processing of the earlier obtained materials.
The main volume of the research projects will be carried out in the Arctic region. As the expedition infrastructure of this work, it is planned to organize specialized voyages of the Russian expedition vessels the “Akademik Fedorov” and the “Mikhail Somov”, set up the North Pole-35 drifting station, construct a new research laboratory at the coast of the Laptev Sea in the Tiksi settlement, expand the existing research base at the Spitsbergen archipelago in the Barentsburg settlement, undertake specialized observations over the operating network of the arctic polar stations, conduct new studies in different regions of the Arctic using aviation, marine and river ships, ground cross-country vehicles, set up the automatic observation stations at the coast, islands and drifting stations of the region.
The main direction of studies in the Arctic region during the IPY period will be the issues of influence of the possible climate changes in the Far North on the life activity of the indigenous peoples and the regional biocenoses and assessment of current and future environmental consequences of the intensification of economic activity in the Arctic. These studies will be conducted in the interests of improving the population life quality and sustainable development of the arctic regions.
In Antarctica, the Russian studies under the IPY Program will be carried out using the infrastructure of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, which includes five year-round operating stations (Mirny, Vostok, Progress, Novolazarevskaya and Bellingshausen), seasonal field bases (Molodezhnaya and Druzhnaya-4), research vessels the “Akademik Fedorov” and the “Akademik Aleksander Karpinsky”, inland sledge-caterpillar traverses, and radio-echo sounding of the underlying surface using the equipment installed on air- and space-borne media. During the IPY period, the network of the RAE seasonal field bases will be expanded by including the earlier temporarily abandoned facilities – Leningradskaya and Russkaya stations in the Pacific Ocean sector of the Antarctic and Soyuz Base in the Prince Charles Mountains. At Molodezhnaya, Leningradskaya and Russkaya Bases, modern automatic meteorological and magneto-variation stations and highly precise receivers of the satellite navigation GPS and GLONAS systems will be installed. This will allow a significant expansion of the existing network of meteorological and geomagnetic observations, which exist in the RAE structure. The prolonged series of observations of highly precise geographic coordinates by means of the receivers of satellite navigation systems will make it possible to determine the parameters of tectonic movements of the Earth’s crust of Antarctica and the changes in the state of the ionospheric layer of the planet. For installation of this equipment in the vicinity of Leningradskaya and Russkaya Bases it is planned during the season of 20007/08 to undertake a circumpolar voyage of the R/V “Akademik Fedorov” around the sixth continent. Such voyage will be made once in two years. During the season of 2008/09 and the next seasons of 2010/11, etc., the area of the operation of research vessels will be restricted by meridians of location of Novolazarevskaya (11° E) and Leningradskya (159° E) stations.
Among the most significant research projects planned by Russia in Antarctica, of special importance is the work for conducting the inland traverse along the Progress station – Vostok station route and for supporting the drilling experiments in order to penetrate the water layer of the subglacial Lake Vostok through the deep borehole 5G-1 situated at the station of the same name. At the traverse route, radio-echo sounding of the ice sheet thickness, sampling of snow for isotopic analyses and satellite navigation observations of the route location will be carried out. At the return route of the sledge-caterpillar traverse from Vostok station to Progress station, studies along the ice sheet flow line passing across Lake Vostok are planned.
The IPY national program is managed by a four-level structure with the ROC IPY at the top of it, which is headed by two co-chairmen – Head of Roshydromet A.I. Bedritsky and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly А.N.Chilingarov.
The current activity of the ROC IPY 2007/08 is performed through the Secretariat organized at Roshydromet in coordination with the JC IPY 2007/08.
The main provisions of the scientific plan and the organization measures for participation of the Russian Federation in the IPY 2007/08 are prepared with the assistance of the Russian Scientific-Coordination Committee (RSCC), consisting of the Management Group of 5-7 lead specialists from Roshydromet , RAS, Ministry for Education and Science and MNR (MG RSCC) and the Working Groups on the main scientific directions of studies of polar regions representing the Russian research institutions.
For the information-analytical support of the measures for preparation and holding the IPY, the Center for Scientific and Information-Analytical Support of activity of ROC IPY 2007/08 was established at the AARI of Roshydromet.
The functions of everyday activity for preparation and holding the IPY 2007/08 were imposed on the International Program Office (IO IPY 2007/08), hosted by the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge (England).
At the initiative of several countries (Russia, Germany, Norway, the USA and Sweden), approved by the JC IPY 2007/08, the Eurasian Arctic Division for IPY 2007/08 is being established in Russia at the base of the AARI of Roshydromet, its main objective being the information and consultative support for the preparation and implementation of the projects of IPY 2007/08 in the Eurasian Arctic.
The national program of Russia for holding the IPY will be financed in the framework of the effective federal and departmental programs. The issue of the possible additional financing will be decided by the government of the Russian Federation at the time of considering the draft federal budgets of the Russian Federation for 2007-2008 and 2009. At present the problem of attracting additional funds from the Russian oil- and gas-producing companies, operating in the Arctic region is being considered.
The realization of the events of the IPY 2007/08 will allow us to:
    • obtain comprehensive information on different environmental compartments of the Arctic and the Antarctic;
    • develop a system of provision of environmental information on polar regions, also with respect to the observation systems and prediction technologies;
    • obtain reliable comprehensive estimates of current and future changes of climate and the state of the environment and develop the recommendations for carrying out the economic, nature protection and other activities in polar regions.
The results of the program can be necessary and useful in different directions of the national activity being undertaken in polar regions.
