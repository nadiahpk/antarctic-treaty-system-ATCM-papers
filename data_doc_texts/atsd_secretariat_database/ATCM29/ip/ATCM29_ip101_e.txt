Selected Highlights of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition, 2005-2006

ATCM Information Paper submitted by Japan

Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions (JARE) are organized by Headquarters established in the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).  This Information Paper introduces two highlights from projects carried out by JARE near Syowa and Dome Fuji in the 2005/06 season.

1.  A New 3,029m Deep Ice Core at Dome Fuji, Antarctica

The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) succeeded in drilling a deep ice core down to 3,029m in depth at Dome Fuji station (77° 19’S, 39° 42’E, 3,810m a.s.l.) on January 23, 2006. It is the third deepest ice core extracted so far, after those from Vostok (3,623m) and EPICA Dome C (3,270m) in the Antarctic ice sheet. 

Dome Fuji Deep Ice Coring Project
Dome Fuji is an ideal place for paleo-environmental study from deep ice cores, as there is no horizontal ice flow and environmental signals deposited with snow have accumulated there. According to radar echo soundings, the ice thickness is presumed to be 3,028±15m. 
Although deep ice coring was performed to 2,503m at Dome Fuji in December 1996, the drill became stuck at 2,332m. From analyses of the cores, global climate and environmental changes over the past 320,000 years (including three glacial and interglacial cycles) were clarified. On the assumption that the snow deposition at 2,503m deep continues to the bottom of the ice sheet, one million-year-old ice can be expected to lie near the bedrock. For this reason, the second Deep Ice Coring Project at Dome Fuji was started with the aim of drilling down to the bedrock. 

Field operations in the 2005/06 season
Field operations in the 2005/06 season are summarized as follows. Seven members of the 47th JARE party for the Dome Fuji station, consisting of two overwintering and five summer personnel, left from Narita on October 30, 2005 and arrived at the Russian Novolazarevskaya station on November 3 by DROMLAN (Dronning Maud Land Air Network) flight IL-76 via Cape Town. From Novolazarevskaya they took the Basler Turbo (BT-67) and arrived at air relay point 2 (ARP2, 3000m a.s.l.), the mid-point between Syowa and Dome Fuji, on November 6. There, they boarded snow vehicles (SM100) of the 46th overwintering team, which awaited them, and finally arrived at Dome Fuji on November 18. A total of 14 personnel started deep ice core drilling as the third season for the second Deep Ice Coring Project at Dome Fuji from a depth of 1,850m, the final depth of the last season.
The deep ice core drilling succeeded in acquiring ice to a depth of 3,028.52m, the third deepest ever achieved in Antarctic ice sheet drilling, on January 23, 2006. Drilling was performed for 127 days, with 851 runs in total, an average core length of 3.42m/run, and an average core acquisition speed of 160m/week. The ice cores have almost no cracks and are of high quality. By analyzing the ice cores, we can reconstruct changes in the global environment over the past million years, and elucidate the riddle of glacial and interglacial cycles of 100,000 years from 600,000-800,000 years ago, the role of greenhouse gases, and changes in the global environment caused by cosmic radiation at the time of erasure of the earth’s magnetic field upon reversal of terrestrial magnetism. We can also discover facts about biological evolution and extreme environment microbes from microbiological research on the ice cores.  Furthermore, it will be possible to know the age of ice sheet formation and directly measure heat flux from the earth’s crust by drilling the bedrock beneath the ice sheet.
After finishing the drilling, the five 47th JARE summer members flew from Dome Fuji to Novolazarevskaya by BT-67 on January 28, and arrived at Narita via Cape Town on February 9. The other seven members left Dome Fuji with snow vehicles on January 29. The deep ice cores from Dome Fuji were transported to and safely accommodated in the deep freezer of the icebreaker Shirase. She returned to Japan on April 13, and the ice cores were transported to low temperature laboratories in Japan for analysis on April 14.

Medical evacuation
During deep ice coring at Dome Fuji, one of the 47th JARE personnel was found to require medical evacuation owing to a circulatory disorder. The BT-67 aircraft was called to Dome Fuji on January 8, and the patient, accompanied by a medical doctor, was transported from Dome Fuji via Troll station (Norway) and Cape Town, arriving safely in Japan on January 14. Personnel at Troll station warmly treated the patient and the medical doctor, while DROMLAN consortium kindly offered to use the chartered aircraft, which was operated by the Swedish Air Force. We sincerely thank the authorities concerned for their support in this medical evacuation. 

2.  Japan-Germany Collaborative Airborne Survey around  Syowa, 2005/06
Background
In order to study the amalgamation and dispersion of the Gondwana Supercontinent, as well as glaciological features of the East Antarctic ice sheet, it is necessary to collect wide-ranging field data on geomagnetism, gravity and topography. In the 2005/06 field season, an airborne geophysical survey around the Japanese Syowa station was proposed through collaboration between the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR).

Operation
A Dornier 228 (Polar-2) equipped with a magnetometer, gravimeter, radio-echo sounder and laser altimeter with GPS was deployed at S17 near Syowa.

A Basler Turbo (BT-67) chartered for DROMLAN was on standby in case of emergency in the first half of the operation (Fig 3). For the sea area flights, helicopters (Sikorsky S-61A) on board the icebreaker Shirase were on standby.  German participants other than air crew flew to and from the station using DROMLAN flights.
A new air base accommodating up to 20 personnel was established at S17 on the continental ice sheet (approx. 600m ASL) near Syowa. It consisted of one mess hut, one generator hut and three Weatherhaven tents with some snow vehicles and sledges (Fig. 4).
The program was successful. Due to good weather conditions in this 2005/06 season, flight time in a single month reached 111.5 hours. The total cover area extended to about 400km x 900km (Fig. 5). The air base was very well maintained in an atmosphere of international friendship.  The second collaborative airborne survey, planned for next season, will focus on the study of atmospheric chemistry in the vicinity of Syowa.
