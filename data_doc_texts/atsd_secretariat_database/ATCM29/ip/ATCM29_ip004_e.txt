2006


1) Reporting of measures adopted pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 13 of the Protocol

Article 13 of the Protocol
1.  Each Party shall take appropriate measures within its competence, including the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative actions and enforcement measures, to ensure compliance with this Protocol.
2.  Each Party shall exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no one engages in any activity contrary to this Protocol..

Legislative and regulatory provision

Law No 2003-347 of April 15, 2003 regarding the protection of the environment in Antarctica (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 90 dated April 16, 2003, p. 6727) implements the provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection, signed in Madrid on October 4, 1991, to the Antarctic Treaty, adopted in Washington on December 1, 1959, and its five annexes. This law introduces in the Environmental Code the provisions of a legislative nature necessary to enforce the Madrid Protocol. 

Decree No 2005-403 of April 28, 2005 (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 101 dated April 30, 2005, p. 7563) completes this legislative provision on several important points, granting the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department (TAAF) primary competence to authorize activities in Antarctica and make the relevant decisions on files of declarations. It also defines the content and modalities of the assessment prior to impact and stipulates the procedure applicable to prior declarations and requests for authorization. In this regard, the Senior Administrator of the TAAF receives all declarations on activities and grants due authorizations, including requests for permits submitted in compliance with the Annexes to the Protocol. 

In compliance with article R.712-3 of the Environmental Code, an inter-ministerial decree, currently being processed for signature, contains a list of activities which must be the object of a previous declaration, provided they only have a less than a minor or transitory impact on the environment.
.

Law No 2005-501 of May 19, 2005 (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 116 dated May 20, 2005, p. 8732) authorizes the adoption of Annex V to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, on area protection and management, whose enforcement is ensured, in part, by the aforementioned legal provisions. 

The Annex was published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic pursuant to Decree No 2005-1075 dated August 23, 2005 (Official Gazette of the French Republic of September 1, 2005). In article R.714-1 of the aforementioned decree of April 28, 2005 all modalities to designate the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas are stipulated  as well as the Antarctic Specially Managed Areas as defined in Annex V,  stipulating that it is incumbent upon the Ministry of Foreign Affaires to adopt the procedure to designate areas of that nature and registration of their management plans in compliance with said Annex at the request of the Ministry for the Environment, after consultation with the Committee for Polar Environment and, if necessary, with the Senior Committee for Sites, Views and Landscape.

Committee for the Polar Environment

The Committee for the Polar Environment, created by Decree No 93-740 of March 29,1993, which in turn was amended by Decree No 2002-496 of April 9, 2002 (Official Gazette of the French Republic dated April 12, 2002), is under the aegis of the Ministry for the Environment. It is responsible for checking the compatibility of relevant human activities by French authorities in polar and sub-Antarctic areas with the preservation of the environment. The Committee receives inquiries on the designation of Specially Protected Antarctic Areas and Specially Managed Areas in keeping with Annex V to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. 

Likewise, the Committee for the Polar Environment receives questions about the program of activities, major projects and impact studies of all human activities in the aforementioned areas. It deals with constant and regular monitoring of human activities in those areas and is responsible for emergency plans and inspection reports. The Committee may also receive inquiries about all matters related to the polar environment and review, on its own initiative, all matters within its sphere of competence. It may also carry out studies and research and formulate proposals and recommendations it considers necessary. 

The by-law dated January 26, 2005 on the creation of the Committee for the Polar Environment was published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic on January 29, 2005. The Committee is composed of a chairperson and ten important figures with a four-year mandate, renewable once, chosen on the basis of their scientific and technological competence on environmental issues. The Committee for the Polar Environment met on October 3, 2005 at the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. The items on the agenda were the adoption of its regulations and review of the first requests for authorizations for activities in Antarctica.



2) Number and nature of permits issued (Annex II to the Protocol, article 6.2) during the 2004-2005 term.

 Article 6
 Exchange of information
2. Each Party shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee before the end of November of each year of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1above and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 1st July to 30th June.

The by-law of August 4, 1998 establishes measures for the protection of birds present in the environs of Dumont d’Urville base. The destruction or removal of eggs or nests is at all times prohibited, as well as the destruction, mutilation, capture or stuffing of non domestic species and, alive or dead, their transport, hawking or peddling, utilization, offer them for sale, their sale or purchase. These protection measures were adopted in keeping with the views expressed by the Committee for the Polar Environment.

The ringed birds in 2003-2004 were 623 snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea), 449 cape petrels (Daption capense), 45 Southern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides), 54 Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) y 48 Antarctic skuas (Catharacta maccormicki). No penguins were ringed.

For the 2005-2006 season, four applications for permits for capture/removal of protected species nesting in Adelie Land were submitted to the French Antarctic and Southern Lands Department. They were linked to long term follow-up studies and specific research, involving ringing, bird control, sampling of blood, muscles and body organs as well as euthanasia. The experiments were authorized by a decision rendered by the National Council for the Protection of Nature (under the Ministry for the Environment). The species affected were 60 snow petrels, 10 Antarctic skuas, 15 Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), 607 Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) y 40 Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli). A request, regarding euthanasia of animals for the purposes of conducting experiments, affected 12 Adelie penguins. These permits were granted to IPEV (French Polar Institute Paul-Emile Victor) for the scientific programs they perform. 

Since October 2002, as was originally provided for in the Environmental Code, permits to capture and release species covered in Title I of Volume II of the rural code regarding the protection of nature are issued by the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department. 

3) Waste disposal and waste management pursuant to Annex III to the Protocol

France has reaffirmed the ban to export waste to the Antarctic Treaty Area, introducing in its domestic legislation the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (and its six annexes), adopted on March 22, 1989 and published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic under Decree No 92-883 dated August 27, 1992.

The amendments to the Annex to the 1978 Protocol regarding al International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, of 1973, which designates Antarctica as a special area under the MARPOL Convention, were published in keeping with Decree No 97-610 dated May 31, 1997.

4) Inventory of activities pursuant to Annex III to the Protocol, articles 8(3) y 9(1)
Article 8
Waste management planning
3. Each Party shall, as far as is practicable, also prepare an inventory of locations of past activities (such as traverses, field depots, field bases, crashed aircraft) before the information is lost, so that such locations can be taken into account in planning future scientific programmes (such as snow chemistry, pollutants in lichens, or ice core drilling)..

Article 9
Circulation and Review of Waste Management Plans
1. The waste management plans prepared in accordance with Article 8, reports on their implementation and the inventories referred to in Article 8 (3), shall be included in the annual exchanges of information in accordance with Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and related recommendations under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.

All waste produced in Adelie Land, except greywater y sewage, son removed. The management program established by the Paul Emile Victor Polar Institute consists on reducing the volume of waste to be treated, particularly solid waste to be combusted, and, regarding non-fuel solid waste, training of members of expeditions and the adoption of simple procedures for waste processing. The fuels used at Dumont d’Urville are transported and stored in barrels or in drums, depending on their nature and use. Since February 1992 waste is transported to Australia with a permit issued by the Federal Ministry for the Environment. The waste is collected at the source in accordance with strict standards.

In Dome C, in the Project itself of the French-Italian Concordia station, waste management is considered, particularly wastewater, with procedures that are not confined to the mere compliance with the Madrid Protocol provisions. In this regard, an agreement was reached between the two construction entities (IPEV of France and PNRA, National Antarctic Research Program, of Italy) and the European Space Agency to develop a greywater and sewage treatment system with recycling facilities used on board manned space vehicles.

5) Number and nature of permits covered in Annex V corresponding to 2005-2006 

In October 2005, the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department issued seven access permits to protected areas in Adelie Land which are part of ASPA No 120, Pointe-Geologie Archipelago. 

These permits were granted to IPEV on three scientific programs. Except for the permits for Jean Rostand, Claude Bernard, Lamarck and Le Mauguen islands and the Bon Docteur nunatak, these were more specifically addressed to the site where the Emperor Penguin colony is.

6) Non-governmental expeditions in 2005-2006 which were notified to the French Authorities
