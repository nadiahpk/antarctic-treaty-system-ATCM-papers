SCAR’s Involvement in the International Polar Year (2007-2009)


- Along with IASC, SCAR is a member ex-officio of the IPY Joint Committee (JC) established by ICSU and the WMO on November 2004, for planning, coordination, guidance and oversight of the IPY. 

- SCAR is well represented in the IPY-JC. The SCAR Executive Director (Colin Summerhayes) is member of the JC representing SCAR. One of the two co-chairs of the JC is a former SCAR National Delegate of Australia (Ian Allison). Another three members of the JC are also SCAR National Delegates: Vladimir Kotlyakov (Russia), Chris Rapley (UK) and Jerónimo López (Spain). A further three members of the JC are scientists very involved in SCAR: Robin Bell (USA), Edith Fanta (Brazil) and Eberhard Fahrbach (Germany).

- the Joint SCAR/COMNAP Committee on Antarctic Data Management (JCADM) is well represented within the IPY structure, in that the JCADM Chief Officer co-chairs the IPY Data and Information Sub-committee.

- SCAR and JCADM will work towards ensuring that during the IPY the goal of Article IIIc of the Antarctic Treaty that “Scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be exchanged and made freely available” is achieved to the maximum extent possible.

- Of the 208 proposals approved by the JC, 97 were relevant to SCAR. 38 of these were Antarctic; 59 were Bipolar. This document focuses on these 97 proposals.  

- The full texts of the 97 proposals can be found on the SCAR IPY web page http://www.scar.org/events/internationalpolaryear/, or alternatively on the ipy web page www.ipy.org.

- Of these 97 proposals, 75 were in the natural sciences (77%), 21 in education and outreach (22%), and 1 in data and information management (1%).

- The 97 proposals are listed in Annex 1. Analysing the distribution shows that:
    (i) 24 are SCAR-led; 
    (ii) 27 are specifically linked to some SCAR group or groups; 
    (iii) 19 have a question mark against them indicating the potential to be linked to some SCAR group or other, in which case that group should contact the principal investigators to seek SCAR involvement;
    (iv) 8 in the science categories (5 under atmosphere; 2 classed as logistics) do not appear related to SCAR’s activities;
    (v) 19 in the outreach and education category are not related to SCAR’s activities.

- Excluding the data and the education and outreach proposals, SCAR leads or is directly involved in 68% of the natural science proposals.

Progress Against SCAR’s Initial Recommendations, Approved at XXVIII SCAR (Bremerhaven, October 2004)

- SCAR has an ad hoc SCAR Advisory Committee on the IPY that exists:

(i) to advise the Executive Committee on the SCAR input to the IPY Science Plan;
(ii) to advise the Executive Committee on the SCAR role in IPY Implementation, and on the content of the IPY Implementation Plan;
(iv) to ensure that IPY is represented in the SCAR Scientific Research Programmes;
(iii) to work with COMNAP to realize IPY objectives for the southern hemisphere;
(v) to monitor the IPY process as it unfolds, and advise SCAR on how its contribution to the IPY should develop.

- Membership of the ad hoc committee comprises:

(i) Chairperson (Colin Summerhayes)
(ii) Standing Scientific Group Chairs for Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Geosciences [Members of programme planning groups should be consulted by SSG heads]
(iii) selected experts (Eberhard Fahrbach (Germany); In-Young Ahn (R. S. Korea); Chuck Kennicutt (USA); Pedro Skvarca (Argentina)
(iv) Ian Allison, the SCAR rep on the IPY Planning Group;
(v) COMNAP representative (Anders Karlqvist);
(vi) JCADM to advise on data management (Dean Peterson)

- Communication takes place by e-mail and meeting in the margins of other meetings (e.g. SCAR Open Science Conference; XXIX Delegates Meeting).

- Progress  against the recommendations in SCAR’s IPY Paper 41 has been as follows:

1. SCAR should participate at the highest level in providing advice for, and overseeing the execution of, the IPY. Progress: Achieved (see comment in second paragraph on page 1).

2. Develop a comprehensive data and information management strategy that facilitates easy access to data collected during the IPY. Progress: The JC has formed a Data and Information Group to develop a data and information policy; the Chief Officer for JCADM (Taco de Bruin) is a Co-Chair of the Group.

3. The IPY Plan should recognise explicitly the major SCAR activities that have been endorsed by the community. Progress: The 5 SCAR Scientific Research Projects are all leading IPY proposals. In addition several proposals are led by SCAR Action and Expert Groups.

5. Get complete coverage with radars for observing geospace as a contribution to SCAR’s ICESTAR programme. Progress: ongoing.

4. Make traverses across Dome A during the IPY to assess the viability of that area for an eventual large diameter astronomical telescope. Progress: ongoing.

5. Establish a Circum-Antarctic Census of Marine Life (CAML) programme during the IPY . Progress: CAML is an approved IPY proposal.

6. Develop an integrated IPY Southern Ocean observing system. Progress: this is the goal of the successful CASO proposal. 

7. Undertake a major bi-polar ice drilling programme. Progress: several drilling proposals have been approved.

8. Take a geological perspective on climate change, on time scales approaching the time resolution of ice cores but extending much further back into the past. Progress: Several proposals addressin g this issue have been approved.

9. Support the Cryosphere Theme of the IGOS Partners to improve coordination of cryospheric observations. Progress: Cryospheric observations are at the heart of several approved proposals.

10. Focus geological attention on the subglacial highlands of the Gamburtsev Mountains. Progress: A Gamburtsev Mountaisn proposal has been approved.

11. Encourage intensive initial exploration of subglacial Antarctic lake environments. Progress: Lake exploration is part of the approved programme.

12.  Develop a benchmark series of geological and geophysical maps. Progress: None as yet.

13. Create a network of autonomous geological and/or geophysical observatories across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, to investigate systems-scale polar geodynamics and interactions with the cryosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. Progress: A number of proposals have been approved for establishing or upgrading observatories. Efforts need to be made to integrate these into a network.

14. Other recommendations included
    (a) Promoting the development of a Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica, for public outreach. Progress: approved as an IPY proposal;
    (b) Quantify human-transported invasive species entering Antarctica: Progress: Aliens proposal approved.
    (c) Develop the marine biodiversity information network (MarBIN): Progress: proposal approved.
    (d) Make a snapshot of human health in Antarctica: progress: Proposal approved.
    (e) Encourage bird counts from ships: No progress.
    (f) Encourage use of Continuous Plankton recorder from ships: No progress.
    (g) Encourage ships to deploy disposable instruments (buoys, floats): No progress.
    (h) Encourage ship operators to keep echo sounders switched on, and to make the data available: Progress: Needs further discussion (should be in the Science Implementation Plan).
    (i) Develop syntheses of results. Progress: will be written in to the Science Implementation Plan.
    (j) Organise meeting on “Space Observations and the Antarctic Region” (in concert with the IGOS Partners and CEOS (Committee on Earth Observing Satellites). No progress.
    (k) Organise meeting on “comparing the performance of climate models (global and regional) in polar regions”. No progress.



Next Steps:

- The JC will be holding an Open Forum on the IPY on July 8th 2006, in association with the XXIX SCAR meeting in Hobart, Tasmania. SCAR will participate in the Open Forum, to make a presentation on SCAR’s role in the IPY.

- SCAR’s role in the IPY, and refinements to the individual SCAR programme plans for the IPY, will also be the subject of discussion (i) among SCAR scientists meeting in Hobart during XXIX SCAR, and (ii) by the SCAR Delegates, who meet there between 17-19 July, 2006.

- The JC has yet to develop a Science Implementation Plan. SCAR should have a significant influence on the development of the plan. Therefore:-

1. The ad hoc SCAR Advisory Committee on the IPY should meet during SCAR Science Week in Hobart to provide XXIX SCAR Delegates meeting with such advice as seems warranted. 

2. The Committee’s terms of reference should be modified as follows:

(i) to ensure that the SCAR input to the IPY Science Implementation Plan is comprehensive and effective;
(ii) to advise the Executive Committee and Delegates on the content of the IPY Implementation Plan;
(iv) to help the SCAR Scientific Research Programmes and other SCAR activities make as effective as possible a contribution to the IPY;
(iii) to work with COMNAP to see that IPY objectives are realised to the maximum possible extent;
(v) to monitor the IPY process as it unfolds, inform SCAR management bodies on progress, and recommend to SCAR management bodies how SCAR’s contribution to the IPY should develop.

- The ad hoc Committee will consult widely within the SCAR family to solicit advice on the way forward throughout the IPY process. 

- Proposed Membership:

(i) Chairperson (Colin Summerhayes)
(ii) Chief Officers of Standing Scientific Group Chairs for Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Geosciences 
(iii) selected experts (Eberhard Fahrbach; Chuck Kennicutt)
(iv) Ian Allison
(v) Jeronimo Lopez
(v) COMNAP representative;
(vi) JCADM representative (Taco de Bruin)
