Principles underpinning Australia’s 
approach to Antarctic quarantine management 

Introduction
Australia recognises that the movement of aircraft, vessels, personnel, support cargo and research equipment between Australia, Antarctica, the sub-Antarctic and the Southern Ocean creates a risk of transferring animals, plants, micro-organisms and materials of quarantine concern. The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is committed to conducting and administering activities in a way that will prevent or minimise such risks, consistent with the environmental principles of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
At the seventh meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) in 2004, Australia submitted Information Paper 71 Australia’s Antarctic Quarantine Practices outlining the administrative and practical quarantine measures adopted to address unintentional introductions via fresh produce, expeditioners’ footwear and clothing, station supplies, scientific equipment and personal effects.
This paper outlines the quarantine management principles established by AAD to underpin Australia’s efforts to prevent or minimise introductions to the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic.
Quarantine principles
    • Quarantine management for Australia’s Antarctic program should reflect excellence and leadership in the development and implementation of policy and procedures.
    • Public education and the training of program personnel should be integral components of protection measures.
    • The technical expertise of individuals and organisations with relevant quarantine experience or roles should be identified and utilised.
    • Protection measures for the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic should be employed regardless of whether an animal, plant or micro-organism has been determined able to establish or cause environmental harm.
    • High standards of quarantine management should be delivered while maintaining operational efficiency in the support of activities; quarantine protection measures should be commensurate with the magnitude and scale of operations. 
    • Quarantine protection measures should be focussed on preventative action and reflect a multiple-barrier approach. 
    • The choice of quarantine treatments should reflect a balance between the risk of quarantine incursions, and the risks of undesirable impacts associated with the treatment.
    • The Australian Antarctic Division’s (AAD’s) quarantine management procedures and performance should be monitored, evaluated and improved upon as a component of the AAD’s Environmental Management System.
    • The environmental impact assessment process associated with any intentional imports of biota to the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic region, such as for research purposes, should involve a wide consultation process.
    • Activities having a high potential to facilitate the introduction and spread of biota should be rejected if the risks cannot be adequately mitigated.
    • Introductions should be eradicated or controlled; eradication should be attempted as the preferred response.
    • Unauthorised deliberate introductions, and negligence resulting in significant accidental introductions, should be investigated and appropriate action taken.
    • 
    • Australian stakeholder confidence in the effectiveness of quarantine procedures should be established.
