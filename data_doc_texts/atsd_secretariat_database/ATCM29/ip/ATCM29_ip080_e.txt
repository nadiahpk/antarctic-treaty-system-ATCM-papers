Methodologies for Assessing Cumulative Impacts: A Progress Report

Information Paper submitted by New Zealand


Introduction

At CEP VII Argentina introduced Working Paper ATCM XXVII / WP28 on the application of environmental impact assessment procedures for tourism activities in Antarctica.  Argentina’s paper argued that existing procedures for environmental impact assessment are not adequate to predict cumulative environmental impacts arising from the activities of many operators at a single site, or of one operator conducting activities at multiple sites.
Recognising that the issue is not confined solely to tourism activities, CEP VII established an intersessional contact group to determine whether the CEP’s “Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica” needed to be amended so as to better account for the issue.
The intersessional contact group, led by Australia, reported back to CEP VIII (ATCM XXVIII / WP 30) and made several suggestions for amending the “Guidelines”.
The intersessional contact group also made 5 recommendations to the CEP.  One of these was to develop a methodology as an annex to the “Guidelines” so as to provide a systematic approach to assessing cumulative impacts.
At CEP VIII New Zealand offered to work on the development of such an annex (paras 108 – 112 of the Final Report of CEP VIII refer).
In the intersessional period, New Zealand has been able to make some progress on the issue.  This Information Paper provides a progress report on what has so far been achieved.  However, further work is required before a more complete methodology can be presented for the CEP’s consideration.  New Zealand will undertake to provide a more complete paper at CEP X.

Methodologies for assessing cumulative impacts

The issue of cumulative impact assessments has received (and continues to receive) significant attention away from Antarctica.  In order to begin to develop an approach or approaches that might prove useful in the Antarctic context a literature search has been undertaken.  
Whilst there are numerous publications on the subject of environmental impact assessment and cumulative impacts, the following are worthy of particular note, and have been useful in compiling this progress report:
    • Introduction to Environmental Impact Assessment
by John Glasson, Andrew Chadwick, Rick Therivel; Routledge (UK) 1999 - ISBN 1857289455- 496 pages
    • Environmental Impact Assessment: A Methodological Approach
edited by Richard K Morgan; Springer 1998 - ISBN 0412729903- 320 pages
    • Handbook of Environmental Impact Assessment Vol II
by Judith Petts; Blackwell Publishing 1999 – ISBN 0632047712


This initial literature search has demonstrated that there are numerous methods available for analyzing cumulative impacts.  And no single approach can be regarded as definitive.  Instead, the approach taken will depend upon several factors including the nature and scale of the proposed activity and the sensitivities of the receiving environment.
In broad terms, methodologies that are useful in analysing cumulative impacts can be grouped into three categories:
    • Methods that describe or model cause and effect relationships, through e.g. matrices and flow diagrams;
    • Methods that analyse trends in effects and / or environmental change over time;
    • Methods that identify areas of sensitivity, value or past losses. 

From among these broad groupings, a number of techniques would appear to have potential utility in the Antarctic context, including:
    • Surveys and / or questionnaires: as a means of gathering relevant information about a broad range of potential effects, from a range of players (past, present and future);
    • Checklists: to identify common or likely cumulative effects from a range of difference sources;
    • Matrices: to determine the cumulative effects by combining individual effects from different actions;
    • Networks and / or systems diagrams: to trace multiple, subsidiary effects of various actions that accumulate on specific components of the environment;
    • Modeling: to quantify cause and effect relationships;
    • Trends analysis: to assess the status of impacts over time;
    • Overlay mapping and / or GIS: to incorporate local environmental information with potential impacts. 

Each of these techniques has strengths and weaknesses.  As a result no single approach can be regarded as being definitive and a number of these techniques in combination is likely to prove more useful.  The strengths and weaknesses of each of the above methodologies will be expanded upon in the final presentation of this work.
Further, any methodology will only be as good as the data available to support it.  Gathering data for cumulative effects analysis is often the most challenging aspect.  In Antarctica limited data availability is a particular challenge, as is the ability to establish monitoring programmes or research to fill the gaps.  This would also support the need to have a range of options available so as to provide adequate flexibility in making the best use of limited data and information sources.

Next steps

On the basis of the work so far undertaken, New Zealand will expand further on the issue and report back to CEP X with a more complete proposal for an annex to the EIA Guidelines.
