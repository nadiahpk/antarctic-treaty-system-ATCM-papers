Marine Acoustic Systems used by National Antarctic Program Vessels





Information Paper on 
Marine Acoustic Systems used by National Antarctic Program Vessels
Submitted by COMNAP to CEP IX under Agenda item 8 (Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    1. Marine vessels use a number of marine acoustic systems such as sonars, current profilers, echo-sounders or seismic arrays.  These systems produce pulses of sound underwater and then record any returned reflections. The pulses are reflected by objects such as the sea bottom, reefs or moorings, by animals, or also by interfaces between bodies of different physical properties, such as between air and water, between water and rock, or between two different layers of water or rocks. Analysis of the returned reflections provides information about the nature, location and distribution of these reflectors. 
    2. Obvious, vital applications include: monitoring water depth to avoid running aground;  surveying Antarctic waters to produce accurate hydrographic charts for safer navigation; or monitoring the position of potentially dangerous submerged parts of icebergs. It has also a wide range of important, very valuable applications in various research areas, from oceanography to geology to geodesy to biology.  
    3. These systems rely on the generation of sound waves in the water, hence of “marine noise”.  And noise can, depending on its frequency or power, be harmful to marine life and in particular to marine mammals. This is an issue that has received increasing attention worldwide.   A number of specific concerns have been raised about the possible dangers to Antarctic marine life and the Antarctic Treaty's Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) decided that it should be a topic for substantive discussion at its 2006 meeting CEP IX. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) would in particular prepare a Working Paper on the issue.
    4. There are a very wide range of types and sizes of systems available, which generate noise in a wide range of frequencies and power, and it would not be possible to make any meaningful evaluation of risks without relating it to types of systems used. COMNAP therefore decided at its 2005 COMNAP XVII meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, to collect detailed up-to-date information on the marine acoustic systems used on National Antarctic Program vessels. Results would be provided to SCAR for input into its working paper and into discussions at the 2006 CEP IX.  Interim results of the survey were provided to SCAR in time for its workshop to review the risks associated with marine acoustics in the Southern Ocean held in Cadiz, Spain, in January 2006.  
    5. The COMNAP survey captured 22 National Program Vessels and is deemed representative of the fleet currently operated by National Programs. Results of this survey are presented in the form of a series of tables listing technical details of the marine acoustic systems installed on these vessels. 
    6. These results provide a reference and a set of practical, matter-of-fact information for input into any further analysis and evaluation of risks associated with marine acoustics in Antarctic waters. 

BACKGROUND
    7. Marine vessels use a number of marine acoustic systems such as sonars, current profilers, echo-sounders or seismic arrays.  These systems produce pulses of sound underwater and then record any returned reflections. The pulses are reflected by objects such as the sea bottom, reefs or moorings, by animals, or also by interfaces between bodies of different physical properties, such as between air and water, between water and rock, or between two different layers of water or rocks. Analysis of the returned reflections provides information about the nature, location and distribution of these reflectors. 
    8. Obvious, vital applications include: monitoring water depth to avoid running aground;  surveying Antarctic waters to produce accurate hydrographic charts for safer navigation; or monitoring the position of potentially dangerous submerged parts of icebergs. Some of these marine acoustic systems are hence essential contributors to safe navigation, that is to safety of life at sea and to protection of the  environment.  
    9. There are also a wide range of important, very valuable applications in various research areas, from oceanography to geology to geodesy to biology.  
    10. Marine acoustic systems rely on the generation of sound waves in the water, hence of “marine noise”.  And noise can, depending on its frequency or power, be harmful to marine life and in particular to marine mammals. 
    11. While marine noise is an important tool for safety of navigation and for science some high power acoustic emissions can affect marine life, in particular marine mammals, and there is international consensus on the fact that marine noise could present a threat to marine mammals and other marine species. 
    12. This is an issue that has received increasing attention worldwide and specific concerns have been raised about the use of marine acoustic systems in Antarctic waters.  
    13. The 1999 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting ATCM XXIII in Lima, Peru, held some discussions on the potential impacts of marine acoustic equipment on marine animals, and on to what extent mitigation strategies were available to reduce these effects. 
    14. At the 2000 meeting of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research SCAR XXVI, in Tokyo, Japan, it was recognised that various nations were seeking an assessment of the environmental impact of marine acoustic equipment used on board National Antarctic Program vessels and it was decided to convene an international workshop to expand knowledge on acoustic impacts.  
    15. Noise pollution in Antarctic waters continued to receive increasing attention in international fora, including at ATCM XXV in 2002 in Warsaw, Poland (where SCAR presented Working Paper 023 on Marine acoustic technology and the environment) and at ATCM XXVII in 2004 in Cape Town, South Africa (where SCAR presented Information Paper 078 ‘SCAR report on marine acoustic technology and the Antarctic environment’).
    16. The 2005 meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Committee for Environmental Protection CEP VIII in Stockholm, Sweden,  again raised the issue of marine noise and its impact on wildlife, in particular on marine mammals. It agreed that it warranted further consideration and that it should be a topic for substantive discussion in 2006 at CEP IX.  
    17. At the 2006 COMNAP meeting COMNAP XVII in Sofia, Bulgaria, it was noted that acoustic noise was a marine biology issue that, in addition to CEP IX, was already on the agenda of two meetings: of SCAR in July in and of the International Whaling Commission2006, Hobart, Tasmania September 2005, Oxford, UK. COMNAP could provide technical input through identification of the types of marine acoustic systems actually installed and used on board National Program vessels. 
    18. Interim results of the survey were provided to SCAR in time for its workshop to review the risks associated with marine acoustics in the Southern Ocean held in Cadiz, Spain, in January 2006.  The workshop  agreed that SCAR would present a Working Paper at CEP IX considering, amongst other things, the results of the COMNAP survey 

COMNAP SURVEY ON MARINE ACOUSTIC SYSTEMS USED ON NATIONAL ANTARCTIC PROGRAM VESSELS
    19. The survey targeted all National Antarctic Program vessels navigating in the Antarctic Treaty Area, whether on a logistics or a research mission. It captured 22 vessels, or about 56% of the current National Antarctic Program fleet of around 39 vessels, and the results are deemed representative of the marine acoustic systems installed on and used by this fleet, especially as instruments on board modern research and logistic vessels are fairly standard.
    20. Details were  received for  22 vessels: the Agulhas, Almirante Oscar Viel, American Tern, L'Astrolabe, Aurora Australis, Ernest Shackleton, Hesperides, Italica, James Clark Ross, Krasin, Lance, Las Palmas, Lautaro, Laurence M. Gould, Leucoton, Nathaniel B. Palmer, OGS Explorer, Paul Buck, Polarstern, Shirase, Tangaroa and Vasily Golovnin. It can be noted that one these vessels, the Paul Buck, is one of five identical sister ships used interchangeably (the Paul Buck, Gus W. Darnell, Lawrence H. Gianella, Richard G. Mathisen and Samuel L. Cobb). Only one of those vessels is used in any given year and the group of five sister ships  is counted as one vessel only under the name Paul Buck.
    21. Fourteen (64%) of those vessels are used both as research and logistics vessels:  the Agulhas, Almirante Oscar Viel, Aurora Australis, Ernest Shackleton, Hesperides, Italica, James Clark Ross, Lance, Laurence M. Gould, Nathaniel B. Palmer, OGS Explorer, Polarstern, Shirase and Tangaroa.
    22. Eight (36%) of these vessels are used for logistic support only: the American Tern, L'Astrolabe, Krasin, Las Palmas, Lautaro, Leucotón, Paul Buck and Vasily Golovnin .
    23. It is worth noting that all ships, even research vessels, also have some logistic support duties. It reflects the isolation of the region and the low number of vessels operated in the region.  
    24. The logistic-only vessels include mostly relatively large cargo ships  and tankers, typically equipped  with one or two single beam echo sounders only.
    25. The results of the survey are provided in six tables corresponding to six different types of acoustic systems. Each table lists all systems of the given type installed and used on the 22 vessels. The six types are as follows:
    • Two types used both in support of safety of navigation and for research:
        ◦ Single-Beam echo-sounders
        ◦ Multi-beam echo-sounders
    • Four types used for research:
        ◦ ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers)
        ◦ Air guns, compressors and arrays
        ◦ Biological echo-sounders
        ◦ Sub-bottom profilers
    26. It should be noted that while the list of equipment was accurate at the time of the survey and is representative of the equipment that is commonly used on such vessels, a number of acoustic systems , such as in particular  air guns, usually belong to different institutions than the ones operating the vessel and are only installed on board  as and when required for specific research programs. 

CONCLUSIONS
    27. There are a very wide range of types of marine acoustics systems available, which generate noise in a wide range of frequencies and power, and it would not be possible to make any meaningful evaluation of risks without relating it to actual types of systems used in the Antarctic. 
    28. COMNAP has collected detailed up-to-date information on the marine acoustic systems used on National Antarctic Program vessels. 

    29. The COMNAP survey captured 22 National Program Vessels and is deemed representative of the fleet currently operated by National Programs. Results of this survey are presented in the form of a series of tables listing technical details of the marine acoustic systems installed on these vessels. 
    30. Measuring the effect of acoustic equipment is complex and depends upon such system parameters as source level, beam width, distance and absorption loss. Consequently, whilst the list of equipment and characteristics in the tables provides an indication of existing capabilities, much more technical analysis would be required to assess the actual acoustic impact of the equipment when in use.
    31. The results of this survey provide a set of practical, matter-of-fact information for input into any further analysis and evaluation of risks associated with marine acoustics in Antarctic waters.
