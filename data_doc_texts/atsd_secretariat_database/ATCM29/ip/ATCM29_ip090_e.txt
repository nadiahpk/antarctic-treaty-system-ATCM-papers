Report of the International Association of 
Antarctica Tour Operators 2005-2006 
Under Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty


Introduction
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities to ATCM XXIX, Edinburgh, Scotland, June 12 - 23, 2006, in relation to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty.

IAATO is a member organization founded by seven companies in 1991 to advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic. 

During the 2005-2006 season IAATO had 75 Members, and as of April 27, 2006, the Association grew to 80 Members during the Annual General Meeting. An updated Directory of Members is on line at www.iaato.org.  Tourism numbers in all categories totaled at least 32,042 including seaborne, air over flights and land-based tourism. Despite the increase in tourists, numbers of vessels and aircraft operations, the season went very smoothly. IAATO Members continued to support established practices that have proved to be effective and offer a strong degree of protection to the areas visited. As a member organization, IAATO seeks to raise the operational standards of Members and the industry as a whole. To do so requires an infrastructure, a forum, time and an economic commitment by each company.

IAATO successfully manages nearly the entire tourism industry in Antarctica and prides itself in the cooperation amongst its business competitors, as well as Treaty Parties.

IAATO has continued to focus its activities in several key areas. The following is a brief synopsis of activities:

    1. Implemented IAATO-wide operational procedures that effectively manage Antarctic Tourism;

    2. Designed and implemented the IAATO Ship Scheduler program. This is a computerized program which enables all companies to input their day-to-day ship schedules, expedition leader names and departure dates into a single database. A master schedule is then issued. This program was very successful during the 2005-2006 season as a preplanning tool. Small adjustments will be made for the 2006-2007 season. Companies will input their schedules after July 1, 2006, for the upcoming season. Database access to the 2005-2006 season was granted to COMNAP and national programs that interact with IAATO regularly. This enables ease in scheduling, transport of scientists, logistics and contingency planning. The Ship Scheduler allowed for effective exchange of information, ship itineraries and allowed IAATO members to plan to reduce environmental impacts at each landing site. The tool works extremely well. Some non-members were included in the master schedule;

    3. Implemented the new Vessel Data Center. Each ship operator and IAATO member is now responsible for uploading all detailed vessel and company information. The primary reason for creating this on-line program is for effective management of the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan and to maintain a database on vessel specifications;

    4. The computerized IAATO Database for loading Post Visit Site Reports into a single electronic database worked extremely well, providing a complete record since the database began in 2003. All tourism statistics dating back to 1989 can be found on the IAATO website at www.iaato.org.  Data analysis has shown that ship staff occasionally input minor errors on forms, so each form is closely inspected before it is downloaded.  Efforts are being made to have the forms reject  incorrect data.  The occasional, relatively minor duplication that occurs is corrected in due course, including that from previous years.  The database has the capability to compile all company, visitor, vessel and activity information as a means of tracking IAATO member’s activities. IAATO posted over 60 different data reports on tourism statistics on www.iaato.org as a matter of interest to the general public. The 2005-2006 data is estimated to be available in July 2006;

    5. Improvements were made to the Standard Post Visit Site Report Form (approved at ATCM XXVIII).   Duplication of a small number of sites required amendments to be made to the forms prior to the start of the 2005-2006 season.   Analysis of the forms indicates that only IAATO members and associated companies use the forms, despite the adoption of ATCM XXVIII Resolution 6. The updated versions were sent to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in October 2006 as well as distributed amongst Parties who issue permits or authorization to tour operators that are outside IAATO. IAATO maintains all the latest versions of the Post Visit Site Reports available on open pages at www.iaato.org;

    6. A survey on site use was created and distributed to all Expedition Leaders, and then analyzed in order to develop a more formal assessment of site procedures, landing beaches and environmental impacts;

    7. Updated the “Seasonal Operational Procedures” found on the Members-Only page of the website to ensure greater protection of the Antarctic;

    8. IAATO continued to promote its Vessel and Aircraft Coordination by using an all inclusive ship schedule, vessel call data and emergency response list;

    9. Continued use was made of the IAATO Member Emergency Medical Evacuation Response (EMER) action plan.  Four IAATO medivacs were required during the 2005-2006 season, and successfully performed by IAATO member DAP;

    10. Adherence was made to the IAATO Site Specific Guidelines (ATCM XXVIII IP90) established in 2003 and revised and submitted in 2005 to ATCM XXVIII.  Thirty-two sites were identified and limits set accordingly.  IAATO spent a significant amount of time and resources on working with the CEP ICG on the review of the ATCM XXVIII Site Guidelines; 

    11. Continued to support all methods necessary to eliminate the potential spreading of Antarctic diseases and translocation of species;

    12. Participated in several Intersessional Contact Groups (ICG’s); 

    13. Closely coordinated with all Provisional Members in their start-up operations and offered support to companies who have employees new to the business;

    14. Furthered work on the proposed IAATO internal Accreditation Scheme as per ATCM XXVIII IP 96.

    15. Participated in international meetings and liaising with National Antarctic Programs, government agencies of the sub-Antarctic island groups, and scientific and environmental organizations as needed;

3 	Participation in Organized Meetings during 2005-2006
3.1 	IAATO held its 17th Annual General Meeting, April 24-27, 2006, in Washington, D.C.    A total of 94 participants attended which included 69 people representing 38 Member companies and 3 new Provisional Member applicants, 1 non-IAATO operator plus representatives from governments, universities, conservation and private research organizations. 

Several Members once again sponsored the attendance of their expedition team. Participating were 10 Captains and 14 Expedition Leaders and numerous field staff. It is essential that our field personnel are brought into the discussions as they add an element of ‘ground-truth’ into all discussions and final decisions. 

IAATO appreciates the participation by respective governments and non-governmental organizations. The following governments sent representatives: Antarctic Institute of Uruguay, Foreign Ministry of France, Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency-Germany), Australian Antarctic Division, United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Antarctic Survey, United States Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation, and Raytheon Polar Services, United States Environmental Protection Agency, United States Department of State and the Governor of Svalbards Office. 

During the last decade approximately 65% of the nationalities of the tourists visiting Antarctica came from the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia. IAATO was pleased that the corresponding governments were present. IAATO encourages government interactions with tour operators and considers it very important that governments share their concerns with operators. Other individuals/organizations/universities in attendance included the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust, South Georgia, Oceanites, Bath University and various representatives from Universities and individuals interested in Antarctic tourism.

We were pleased that Mr. Jan Huber from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) was able to join us again and we appreciate the opportunity to work in cooperation with the ATS.
	
IAATO Members appreciated the participation of the Executive Secretary of the Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operator’s Organization (AECO).  AECO used this opportunity to hold a separate meeting.

The complete agenda is available on request. Included in the 2006 agenda were Site Guidelines (station visits and guidelines, web-based ship scheduler, post visit site reports, active management strategies, review of 100 passengers ashore policy, station visits and guidelines, Marine Committee and Marine Operations new vessel database, work of the Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica, emergency contingency planning (EMER), ballast water, communications safety and navigation, communications software and new technology, boot washing stations, Zodiac operations and safety, IPY, Membership updates and issues, accreditation, field staff reviews and report, information management, land-based tourism, liability annex, updates from British Antarctic Survey, South Georgia, Palmer Station and the United States Antarctic Program, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and more.

IAATO will hold its 18th Annual General Meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, in June, 2007 (final dates to be decided). Interested parties that would like to attend or participate should contact IAATO at iaato@iaato.org.

        3.2 IAATO had two representatives at the COMNAP meeting in Bulgaria in July 2005. IAATO appreciates the opportunity to work cooperatively with COMNAP where mutual interests lie.

        3.3 IAATO held a 3-day meeting in New York City in September 2005 to discuss site guidelines and accreditation. Representatives from IAATO’s committees attended as well as the United Kingdom, United States and Australia. IAATO appreciated the time and effort by all involved and felt the input was mutually valuable.

        3.4 IAATO was very pleased to send one participant to the IHO/HCA Meeting in New Zealand in November 2005. IAATO supports and encourages the work of the HCA. Safety and navigation are extremely important concerns to vessel operators and the productive work by this group is invaluable for all ship operators.

        3.5 While in the Southern Hemisphere in November 2005, IAATO also was grateful to New Zealand for the invitation to attend the fuel handling workshop. In addition, IAATO was asked to be a keynote speaker at the Australian Ecotourism Conference in Hobart. 

        3.6 Dr. Kim Crosbie, IAATO Environmental Operations Manager, participated on the site inspection trip on board HMS Endurance. In addition she spent a significant time in Ushuaia interviewing Expedition Leaders and talking to Captains and officers about all aspects of tourism management. 

        3.7 Denise Landau attended the Fildes Peninsula Workshop in late January and early February  2006. IAATO members provided transport for nearly all the participants that were not working at one of the research stations in the Maxwell Bay Area. IAATO is grateful to Germany for organizing this workshop and thought it to be extremely productive and hope that future work on this subject will occur.

        3.8 Dr. Chris Curry attended the Non Native Species in the Antarctic Workshop organized by New Zealand on behalf of IAATO. Chris has been working with IAATO and or IAATO member companies for over 10 years developing the boot washing guidelines conducting a scientific studies on the translocation of organisms and providing IAATO with guidelines on preventative measures.

        3.9 Numerous other meetings took place between IAATO Members, IAATO Committees and their representative governments throughout the year. IAATO values a cooperative working relationship with respective governments on tourism issues and encourages such meetings.

4	Field Coordination
4.1	IAATO compiles seasonal updated information, including vessel call data, a comprehensive ship schedule, emergency contact information, expedition leader schedules, and yearly seasonal operational procedures. In addition there are over 50 files hosted on the IAATO website per season providing members with appropriate guidelines and operating procedures 

4.2	IAATO’s comprehensive directory of Vessel Call Data and the Master Ship Schedules are shared with COMNAP and other government offices to encourage improved communication and operational coordination. COMNAP’s MINIATOM is an extremely useful tool for tour operators trying to contact stations or government vessels. As IAATO vessels transport numerous scientists and support personnel to Antarctica each year, in addition to requesting tourist visits to stations, it is helpful when station contact information is up-to-date for communication, planning and emergency purposes. 

4.3	Expedition leaders and ship's officers circulate advance day-to-day itineraries and maintain regular contact throughout the season to coordinate site visits and exchange general information such as ice conditions, weather, landing recommendations, and concern about potential environmental impacts, etc. A key factor in managing Antarctic tourism and mitigating potential environmental impact is to ensure that no two ships land passengers at the same place at the same time. An example of the annual instructions to ships’ captains, radio officers and expedition leaders is included as Appendix A. 
	
4.4	Details on IAATO’s Emergency Medical Evacuation Response plan (EMER) have been presented at previous ATCMs. IAATO Member Aerovias DAP offered this service for Members during the 2005-2006 season. Aerovias DAP performed a total of four tourist medical evacuations for members from King George Island to Punta Arenas for IAATO members.

5	Environmental Impact Assessment 
5.1	All IAATO members have submitted either Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA’s) or Operational documents that substitute for EIA’s to their national authority. Not all governments require EIA’s. IAATO is aware of several non-IAATO vessels this year that have either not submitted environmental impact assessments, filed Advance Notification or Post Visit Site Reports. 

5.2	A comparison of the various EIA’s and the level of EIA’s that individual operators submit to their respective governments show a number of inconsistencies amongst documents. IAATO, however, has bridged gaps in documentation for ship-based operators in particular to assure there are mitigation measures and procedures in place to avoid environmental impacts.

5.3	IAATO remains deeply concerned about non-IAATO operator activities. The Association urges Contracting Parties to ensure that obligations of the Environmental Protocol are being met and that Environmental Impact Assessments are being submitted and that detailed mitigation measures are included. IAATO is concerned that once the paper work process is completed by non-members, there is no supervision of management or follow-up to ensure that non-members are following the requirements of activities.

5.4	IAATO requests that when non-IAATO operators submit EIA’s that reference IAATO’s operational procedures the respective governments should be encouraged to contact IAATO for verification. It is not possible for non-IAATO operators to have the breadth or understanding of the numerous operating strategies IAATO has developed over the years. 

6	Procedures to Prevent the Introduction of Alien Organisms
6.1	For the past seven seasons, IAATO’s Boot and Clothing Decontamination Recommended Guidelines and Translocation of Diseases Protocol have proven to be effective. These guidelines unofficially have been operative for the last twelve years by most Members. Past ATCM papers have included this important guideline. Both the above-mentioned guidelines have been tabled previously as attachments at SATCM XII, ATCM XXIV, ATCM XXV and XXVII (in IAATO’s Annual Reports). A separate paper on the subject was tabled in Stockholm as ATCM XXVIII IP 97.

7	Reporting of Tourism and Non-governmental Activities and Data Base
7.1	Antarctic tour operators use the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO modifies the reports each year as inconsistencies are discovered. All updated versions can be found on the open pages of the IAATO website.  Previous versions of the form have been discontinued, and should not be used.  

7.2	IAATO continues to support the use of this single form, which reduces the burden of paperwork and facilitates the study of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourist activities. IAATO would like to encourage Parties to send IAATO a copy of any forms received from non-IAATO operators in order for the data to be incorporated into IAATO’s “Overview of Tourism” and the IAATO tourism data base. This will provide for greater transparency of all tourist activities and will further the ability to address cumulative impact issues. IAATO’s data base will be able to access information from these forms and analyze, if necessary, statistics on site use and visitation. 

8	Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1 (Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic and Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic) and Other Guidelines
	Recommendation XVIII-1, “Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic”, is provided to all Members in order to inform them of key obligations and procedures to be followed. 
	
	IAATO urges “Parties” to consider formally adopting Recommendation XVIII-1. It is our understanding that these guidelines have not yet been formally adopted.

        8.1 IAATO is very concerned about tourists traveling on non-IAATO vessels visiting the Antarctic who may not be aware of the Environmental Protocol and its obligations. As tourism increases, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula region, every visitor and operator will need to be responsible for even greater care of the landing sites and the marine environment. 

        8.2 IAATO’s standard operating procedures for implementing Recommendation XVIII-1 include the following: 

    • Mandatory briefings on each tour ship prior to arrival in the Antarctic. This presentation consists of the IAATO slide or PowerPoint presentation. This presentation can be viewed on line at www.iaato.org under “Guidance for Visitors” on the home page. Most expedition leaders will however enhance the presentation with additional slides and commentary. 
    • Passengers, ships’ command, crew and expedition staff receive paper copies of Recommendation XVIII-1 “Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic.” Some companies distribute this document in pre-season materials in advance of departure, some on board the ship. In addition to receiving copies of the Recommendation, all passengers and ship’s personnel are required to attend the briefing. 
    • Guidelines are available on the open pages on the IAATO website in English, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish. 


8.3	In addition, IAATO Members continue to use IAATO and/or company adopted guidelines which include: marine wildlife watching, site specific information, assessment checklist for visiting ‘new’ sites, kayak, mountain climbing, camping, scuba, helicopter, Zodiac, Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV), boot and clothing decontamination and disease protocols.


9	Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning
9.1	At IAATO’s 17th Annual General Meeting (2006) the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan was reviewed and discussed for its efficiency. This updated plan is submitted as a separate paper to ATCM XXIX.

9.2	IAATO instituted a ships database noting vessel specifications.

9.3	Members have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEP) in place on their vessels that satisfy Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL. A “Special Antarctic Addendum” to the SOPEP was developed by IAATO and distributed to Members for implementation and comment in 1998 (ATCM XXII/IP104). While the Addendum has no legal status, it includes notice to contact Antarctic stations in the vicinity of any marine pollution incident, along with appropriate national authorities. 

9.4	The IAATO EMER plan has been in place for at least the past nine seasons in order to reduce the need to impact scientific stations in the Antarctic Peninsula with tourism-related medical problems. A standard medical information checklist is available for new Members in order to ensure adequate medical supplies are available on board vessels.

10	Scientific and Information Support 
	Members continue to provide logistic and scientific support to National Antarctic Programs and to the sub-Antarctic Islands, providing a cost-effective resource for the scientific community. During the 2005-2006 season, scientists, support personnel and gear from various National Antarctic and Sub Antarctic Programs were provided transport to and from stations, field sites and gateway ports. A partial list of scientific support is included as Appendix D. Further descriptions are noted below.

	Specific requests for logistic or other support should be made to Members or the IAATO Secretariat. For a complete Membership directory, please refer to the IAATO web site at www.iaato.org.


11	Conservation Research, Academic and Scientific Support
Members and their passengers continued the tradition of direct financial contributions to many organizations active in Antarctica. Appendix C provides a partial list of donations. 


12	Observers On Board Member Vessels 
IAATO requires Provisional and Probational Members to carry an observer before they are eligible to apply for Full Membership. During the 2005-2006 season, IAATO appointed 3 observers to sail on Provisional Member vessels. There were no Probational Members. IAATO considers using a qualified National Program observer from the country in which the company is registered. When not available, IAATO will appoint an appropriate person with broad experience in Antarctic and or related matters. IAATO updated the “Checklist for Observers” form (version October 2005) for use this season.   In addition, ATCM XIX Resolution 5 (1995), Antarctic Treaty Inspection Checklists, is also provided to the appointed observer. IAATO vessels have been carrying observers since 1991. 


13	Discoveries and Adventure
The icebreaker vessel Kapitan Khlebnikov (Quark Expeditions), and their small boats, reached what is believed to be the farthest south navigation of any ship to date, on February 1 and 2, 2006.  On February 1, the ship reached the point: 78°40.872’S and 164°43’ W and then on February 2, the ship’s small boats reached: 78° 41.030’S and 164°11.40’ W.


14	With Thanks -- Cooperation with National Programs
The following provided assistance and operational guidelines to IAATO during the 2005-2006 season, for which Members are grateful:

    • Chile: For the use of the runway at Marsh/Frei for medical emergencies in conjunction with Member Aerovias DAP and to Bellingshausen Station for accommodating last minute requests during medivacs. There were 4 IAATO medivacs this season.
    • United Kingdom: United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Antarctic Survey, Port Lockroy, and U.K. Antarctic Heritage Trust, Sub Antarctic Islands' personnel and others for making visits an extremely educational and enjoyable experience and for providing Members with comprehensive guidelines for visits to BAS stations.

Appendix B: IAATO Expedition Leader and Ship’s Officers Seasonal instructions- Post Visit Site Report Instructions 2005-2006 Season
(July 29, 2005 version)


TO:     All IAATO Office Representatives, Antarctic Captains, Expedition Leaders and Radio Officers 

The following information is included in order to further guide the exchange of information among vessels, and to assist with co-ordination of itineraries and to facilitate the end of season reporting. Note this plan is subject to change. If a change is required an update will be sent.
Exchange of Itineraries
    • IAATO members agree to exchange itineraries and coordinate schedules. This is a key factor in self-regulation, monitoring of activities and also in effective emergency response.
    • Consult the IAATO schedule to determine which vessels will be in your cruising area. Specific landing sites noted on the schedule are given landing priority. Expedition companies were expected to input their schedules into on line the master ship scheduling system. The final IAATO schedule that will be issued in October 2005 will determine landing priorities.  Any other changes or updates after this need to be done directly between the vessels.
    • Itineraries must be communicated between vessels directly and not rely on corporate offices once the season begins.
    • Be sure to also exchange environmental information and management recommendations for individual landing sites or other notices with your colleagues as the season progresses.
Itinerary Changes
    • If your final itinerary changes, circulate by GMDSS, Telex by broadcast mode or radio or fax. Confirm during Radio Chat time at 1930.  (Please note that few tour vessels have regular real-time exchange of e-mail.) Since all ships are supposed to be equipped with a GMDSS radio station, they should be able to scan a frequency in the 6310 KZ band (24 hrs). By using broadcast mode (one way) ships can send itineraries, ice information and other information as needed. These transmissions will be picked up by all vessels and should be able to print out the incoming message immediately. 
    • To avoid conflicts, notify vessels in the region of any changes in planned itinerary as soon as practicable. 
    • Notification should be by GMDSS radio telex first then INM-C, fax, telex, VHF or HF (see below).
    • Notify any vessel of intention to cancel a landing. Due to itinerary changes, weather, ice etc. another vessel would appreciate having an additional landing option.
Landing Priority
    • In general, priority is given to what is listed on the official IAATO schedule. Landing sites were pre-agreed prior to the season and resolved by all companies accordingly.
    • In the event of conflict, expedition leaders should co-ordinate between themselves to determine priority, which is best accomplished through negotiation via HF or VHF. 
    • Please resolve any conflicts equitably. It is assumed that vessels visiting a site with some regularity will give way to a vessel that is not but any number of factors may come into play. 
    • Two vessels are not to land at the same place at the same time and, to avoid any potential environmental impacts, efforts should be made to spread out visits over time.
    • If a company isn’t specific about where in a particular place they plan to land (for example if Deception Island was listed but another company listed Whalers Bay), the company listing Whalers Bay is given priority.
Station Visits
    • Expedition Leaders must provide 72-hours notice to station leaders of any planned station visit.
    • Follow individual procedures determined by national programs/station leaders.
    • Provide timely notice of cancellation, generally 48 hours in advance.
    • Please include any additional station contact information, standard procedures or incidents involving stations, ships or government personnel in your voyage report to the home office.

Station Guidelines for Palmer, Rothera, Signy and Port Lockroy, Base A
    • Visits to Palmer Station are not allowed on Sundays and preferably not on Saturdays. All Palmer visits have been prearranged. Any changes, please advise Palmer as soon as possible. There is an official Palmer Station schedule issued each season. Provide Palmer Station with 72 hours notice even though you have a prearranged visit. See Palmer Station Guidelines for further information. 
    • Visits to British Stations (Rothera, Signy, and Halley) have also been pre-arranged as per procedures by British Antarctic Survey.
    • Port Lockroy: Base A has a specific visitation policy and site-specific guidelines provided by British Antarctic Survey. Please read these guidelines carefully.

Channel 16
    • Channel 16 is used for hailing purposes only, NOT general communication.
    • After making contact, immediately switch to another channel to continue conversation.
    • Expedition Leaders should periodically review radio etiquette with staff. The airwaves during the height of the season in the Peninsula have been crowded, which is an issue with IAATO members and potentially with research stations. Take care to follow standard international procedures.
IAATO Radio Schedule 
    • IAATO members have agreed to implement a once daily radio schedule at 1930.
    • Suggested HF hailing frequencies are: 4146 (1), 6224 (2)-SSB, 8294 (3), to be finalized by radio officers during the season based on experience. Use 6224 whenever possible.
    • Expedition leaders and or an appointed staff member should make use of this schedule whenever VHF communication is impossible for exchange information. This will reduce communication costs.
    • Switch to another frequency for any extended conversation when talking on the above-mentioned HF (4146, 6224).
    • Avoid long conversations over the radio if possible.
    • Protocol for the 1930 chat time: All parties wanting to sort out schedules should make themselves known. Sort all itinerary business first and reschedule any other discussions for a later time. Anyone who simply wants to “chat” should find another time and frequency. ELs not available to talk at this time should appoint another individual to monitor in case a ship is trying to reach you.
    • It is extremely important to not chatter on HF. In years past many EL’s or staff simply did not listen to the chat channel because there were too many lengthy conversations. This channel must be open at 1930 for vessel scheduling and for communication of emergency situations. Again, if you need or want to chat longer, establish a different time and frequency.
    • Vessels equipped with HF-Tlx should scan 6310.0 Khz TX/RX 24 hours. 
GMDSS or Telex C or “other” Communication
    • Each vessel is encouraged although not required to report the noon position (Ushuaia local time for the Peninsula Region) to each other via GMDSS radio telex or INM-C. Each radio officer should record this information.  
    • GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress Safety System) is the only reliable means of communication and it should be used daily by all ships.
    • Since not all ships are equipped with GMDSS for all coverage, A1, A2, A3 and A4, ships without full coverage can only reliably communicate via INMARSAT-C. Therefore it is important for each ship to pre-establish by what means they will be communicating with each other. The INM-C and the pre-established GMDSS radio telex frequency will allow ships to share information daily. In an emergency, it is the only reliable means of communication. 
    • For additional information reference the agreed IAATO Emergency Contingency Planning Agreement, 14th General Meeting, 2003 and ATCM XXVI Information Paper 69 on Contingency Planning.
EMER (Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response)
    • Review the IAATO EMER Plan -- ask if there are any questions in order to have complete understanding.
    • The reporting scheme indicated above is an integral part of emergency response. Please insure that it is followed and report any difficulties to your home office.
    • Tourists cannot be disembarked at any station for medical reasons unless there is a medical evacuation response established. 
Post-Visit Reporting
The Process
    • Following Antarctic Treaty recommendations, complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the standard Post-Visit Site Report for every expedition. The 2005-2006 version of the form should be the ONLY form completed for Antarctica. At the end of each voyage return the form and a computer disc to the home office. It is preferable that the form is emailed to IAATO and US NSF after each trip; however some companies prefer to review the forms first. It is therefore the company’s responsibility to forward the form as soon as possible to IAATO and NSF and not wait until the end of the season.  Email to iaato@iaato.org and to nkennedy@nsf.gov.
    • Always submit a computer version and hard copy of each form. Information gleaned from this form is tabulated and circulated internationally by the National Science Foundation, USA and by IAATO in the form of statistics and input into the tourism database. IAATO recommends that the Ship, individual EL’s and each home office keep copies of each Post Visit Site Report. In.Fue.Tur in Ushuaia also requests a copy of this form in order for them to compile their tourism information.
    • EL’s, please note that this information is used for tourism statistics that are tabled worldwide. Please do not hastily fill this out. If you have questions, consult your home office. 
    • We cannot accept hand written forms. All forms must be typed and on the official EXCEL format. If the form is not compatible with the computers on board ship notify your company representative immediately.
    • Do not wait until the end of the season to send forms to IAATO and NSF and to your national authority. Due to the increased number of vessels during the season we need the reports on a timely basis throughout the season.

The Standard Post Visit Site Report Form Instructions
This form is required in accordance with Antarctic Treaty Recommendation XVIII-1 and Resolution XIX-3 to be filled out by any person(s), companies or organizations visiting the Antarctic continent or any island or territory within the Antarctic Treaty region for the purposes of recreation or tourism.  

The form consists of two parts; An Expedition record (part 1) and a Site Visit record (part 2) which must be completed by the Expedition leader or Captain and submitted to an appropriate national authority. 

The Expedition record (Part 1) must be completed for every expedition to the Antarctic region regardless of whether any landings or visits to sites were made.  

The Site Visit record (Part 2) should only be completed if visits or landings were made to sites in the Antarctic region. For cruise only vessels you can include waterways.
