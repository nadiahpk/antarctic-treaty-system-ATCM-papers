Argentine Antarctic Art


The Argentina Antarctic Art encourages and promotes the exploration of aesthetic proposals to develop specific projects in the Antarctic continent. 
The programme is part of the Antarctic Summer Campaign carried out between November and March each year. Works are intended to be showed through national and international temporary and itinerant exhibitions, as well as through communications, seminars and exchanges. 
Goals
    • To include Antarctica into national and international cultural projects in order to deepen the relationship between Argentina and Antarctica.
    • To establish contact with people having no access to Antarctica, through the integration of the art in historical and scientific expositions. 
    • To encourage the development of the Argentinean contemporary art and the theoretical reflection in the Antarctic continent.
    • To improve links between art and science, by encouraging the interaction of the different matters.
    • To develop the Antarctic imaginary, the national thought and the responsibility on the Antarctic patrimony and the environment.
    • To enhance links with different institutions to build cooperation relationship.
    • To promote the Argentinean contemporary art and to diffuse it abroad, by establishing the concept of belonging of Antarctica in the national culture.
International frame
Nations with Antarctic interests have developed programmes with cultural contents with the aim of diffusing the Antarctic activity in the various continents. This allows to obtain a best contact with people in general and to share relevant aspects of different cultures. 
Within this frame Argentina, based on its history and participation in the activity, since it has logistic, scientific, and artistic resources, has opened its cultural activities and worked together with some artists from member nations of the Antarctic Treaty. 

National frame
Our country has a project that identifies Antarctica with its culture. Artists from different areas have participated, allowing a connection with the community. 
The project facilitates the integration of different cultures with Antarctica, as well as the education in Antarctic matters of children, young men and adults. 

Strategy
It is based on the importance of artist impressions as part of an approach of Antarctica to the current citizen, in compliance with policies of Argentina concerning the inclusion of the whole society in the knowledge on Antarctic activities. With this system, academic knowledge at different levels of the formal education will be improved. 
Qualification of young artists and experienced artists is made through a selection with similar characteristics as those of scientific projects. This has allowed to select those who represent the best cultural and aesthetic values of Antarctica.
