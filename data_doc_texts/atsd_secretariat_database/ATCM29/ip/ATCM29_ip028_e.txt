Report by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) on “Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters”


Introduction
Once again the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) would like to take this opportunity to thank the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) for having invited our Organization to report at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), on the progress made in the Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters. This report covers the period between the XXVIIth and XXIX ATCMs.   
IHO is proud of its direct contribution to safety of life at sea, safety of navigation, the protection of the marine environment and the marine scientific research  in Antarctica. The coordination of all the Hydrographic Offices with responsibilities in the Antarctic provides a unique example of teamwork aiming at updated and reliable hydro-cartographic products. In this sense, the IHO Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica plays an important role and works closely with several other international organizations, to increase the value of its efforts.     
The encouragement of continuing efforts made to the IHO by the XXVIIIth ATCM in Stockholm last year was received as an expression of support to the activities conducted by the Organization, mainly by its Hydrographic Committee on Antarctic. 

The IHO Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica
The Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica (HCA) met in the International Antarctic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 2-4 November 2005, thanks to the kind invitation of New Zealand Government, through Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). At this meeting we were honoured by the presence of Mr. Johannes HUBER, Executive Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat who participated actively on the debates. The IHO would like to highlight this as a clear demonstration of the excellent existing relationship between the ATS and the IHO.  
At the above-mentioned meeting, amongst other technical topics, the following issues were discussed in detail: 

    a) The Committee membership status as it has been noted that several potential participating MS had not yet signed the HCA statutes. 
    b) The progress made so far as regard to the production of INT charts and ENC. 
    c) Procedure and methodology to update and visualize the content of IHO S-55 Publication “Worldwide Status of Hydrographic Surveying and Nautical Charting”, as regard to Antarctica. 
    d) The way to continue improving the existing excellent relations and cooperation with other international organizations. 
    e) The Report submitted by the HCA Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group.   

HCA Membership
As regard to HCA membership, the Committee agreed to contact each of the following IHO Member States who have not yet signed the HCA Statutes, ( i.e. Brazil, Ecuador, Japan, Rep. of Korea, Peru, Poland, Ukraine, USA and Uruguay), with a view to obtaining clarification of their intentions about participating in HCA activities. It was decided that, meanwhile, they will appear in a separate “pending confirmation of membership” list. Actually 15 IHO MS (Argentina, Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain and United Kingdom) have signed the HCA statutes which were agreed at the 3rd HCA Meeting (Monaco, September 2003) and therefore qualify as HCA Members. 

INT Chart Production
The INT Chart production, continues to show progress. Out of 91 INT charts contained in the cartographic scheme, 56 have already been published (Annex A). That means that there has been an approximate 25 % increase since last year. 
The production of ENC also has shown an increase, and today we have 8 Charts available as ENC.   

IHO Publication S-55
There is a clear understanding that IHO Publication S-55 “Worldwide Status of Hydrographic Surveying and Nautical Charting” needs to be kept updated, and the IHO through the HCA claims for action to its members. The way in which S-55 is presented in the IHO website might be improved by the way of a dedicated visualization software, allowing the user to get a clear picture of the situation for strategic planning, decision-making, international coordination of a work program, and other activities. With the support of some HCA Members, the IHB has been testing different alternatives to be used for this purpose that also could be used as a prototype for other Regional Hydrographic Commissions. It seems that a solution has been found and at the next HCA Meeting the IHB will be in a position to demonstrate a system for consideration.    

Relation with other International Organizations
The IHO has been honoured with the strong support of several international organizations such as IMO, IOC, IAATO, COMNAP, and the proper ATS. The participation of the Executive Secretary of the ATS, as mentioned earlier in this report, is an example. Another is the invitation received by IAATO to have the Chairman of the HCA WG on board an IAATO ship and get an in-situ perspective of the hydrographic needs in Antarctic.  The contribution of all has been outstanding. A practical suggestion to submit working papers to the ATCM through COMNAP was considered an excellent alternative to emphasize the joint work HCA does with all organizations involved in different ways with hydrography, nautical cartography and marine safety information, products and services.  One of the concerns expressed at the meeting was about the applicability of SOLAS V in Antarctica, in particular regarding the obligation/responsibility for the provision of hydrographic services. It was agreed to seek IMO’s views but it would also be interesting to learn ATCM position in this regard.   

  
Progress made by the Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group.
As the ATCM is aware, in 2004 the HCA established a Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group aiming to improve effectiveness by establishing priorities as regard to hydrographic surveys to be conducted, priorities that could be considered by MS in their participation associated with the International Polar Year or in their normal planning.     
The achievements made by the Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group can be summarized as follow: 
A.	Data Rendering Form – Guidelines for the gathering and submission of hydrographic data in Antarctic waters, essentially coming from IAATO and COMNAP ships, were developed. The form for submitting data was agreed and is included as Annex B. It was agreed that all forms, when completed, would be collated in a single point, and the UK Hydrographic Office was identified. (c/o Chairman of HCA Survey Programme WG). The IHO has given wide distribution to this Guidelines and Form through COMNAP and IAATO and also has posted the documents in the IHO website. 
B.	Additions to the INT Chart Scheme – Following a proposal by IAATO to include additional charts to the INT Chart Scheme for Region M, in the Antarctic Peninsula, WG officers studied the proposals and developed the details for 20 additions to the scheme (see Annex C). Those additions were accepted by the HCA and the IHB was tasked, in liaison with the WG Chairman, to prepare an update of the scheme. (Annex D)
C.	Maritime Shipping Routes (MSR) – The WG developed a list of main and branch corridors around the Antarctic Peninsula, based on a submission by the UKHO (Annex E). This was complemented by a submission from the Australian Antarctic Division, for MSRs between Australia and the Australian bases in Antarctica. A proposed long term survey plan was prepared by assigning Usage Category and Survey Status Category values to each corridor (Annex F). This plan was accepted by the HCA.
D.	High Priority Surveys - Also the HCA approved a  proposal identifying a short list of high priority surveys (Annex G), with the aim that focus should be on surveying those areas on the occasion of the IPY. The short list has been submitted for endorsement to the IPY Coordinating Committee, ATCM and COMNAP; and circulated to IHO Member States for information and possible inclusion in their national survey programmes.
Conclusions
1.-	Coordination and cooperation between the IHO and other international organizations interested in the Antarctica is a fact, and the progress made is evident. The participation of the ATS Executive Secretary at the last HCA meetings has proven to be beneficial to all those institutions attending HCA meetings, and this practice should be continued.  
2.-	The availability of INT Charts, from 45  last year to 56 nowadays, is a clear indication of the progress achieved so far by the IHO. New demands of INT charts put an extra pressure on the need to conduct hydrographic surveys.  
3.-	The establishment of the HCA Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group has been an excellent idea and the progress so far reached, a great contribution to guide the hydrographic effort in Antarctic. 

Recommendations
It is recommended that the XXIXth ATCM : 

1.-	Accepts the IHO Report. 

2.-	Acknowledges the increasing demand of INT charts and the progress so far made in
its production.    

3.-	Endorses and supports the procedure established for the Collection and Rendering of
Hydrographic Data approved by HCA.  

4.-	Takes note and endorses the short list of  High Priority Surveys identified by the
HCA.

5.-	Invites IHO to continue efforts and to increase the coverage of hydrographic 
information in Antarctic, especially in main passages and ports, and where there are 
vulnerable or protected marine areas.

Note 1

The largest scale chart, a plotting sheet at a similar scale, a UKHO collector, a tracing or chart cutting should be used to plot the ships position during data collection.

If a chart cutting is used the additions and alterations should be marked in red. If a tracing is preferred, the additions should be marked in red, with adequate chart detail in black to enable fitting down. If a chart is rendered with data inserted, a replacement copy will be supplied free of charge.

Computer discs and CD Roms are also an easy way to render data and photographs, but must have easily readable formats.


Note 2

    1. Visual fixes: To ensure the greatest accuracy, a fix defined by compass bearings or ranges, should consist if possible of more than two observations. These observations should be taken as nearly as possible simultaneously, carefully recorded at the time and listed in the report with any corrections that have been applied to them. 

    2. GPS positions:  The report should state which datum was set on the receiver outputting positions,(eg WGS84 Datum) and/or whether any shifts quoted on the chart have been applied.

    3. Mariners are requested to report observed differences between positions referred to chart graticule and those from GPS, referenced to WGS84 Datum.


Note 3 

The following information should be included about the echo sounder:

    1. Make, name and type of set.
    2. The number of revolutions per minute of the stylus (checked by stopwatch) (see NP100)
    3. The speed of sound in sea water in metres per second equivalent to the stylus speed.
    4. Whether soundings have been corrected from Echo-sounding correction tables.
    5. Setting of the scale zero. That is whether depths are recorded from the sea surface or from under the keel. 
    6. Where the displacement of the transducers from the position of the GPS receiver or other instrument used to fix is appreciable, the amount of this displacement and whether allowance has been made for it should be reported.
    7. For methods of checking the accuracy of a sounder see NP100 2.87 - 2.89.
    8. Where numerous sounding lines have been produced, it would be desirable to run “cross lines” at right angles to the main lines to provide an extra check on the validity of the data surveyed.  


Note 4

Echo Trace

If an echo trace is rendered it should be marked as follows:

    1. A line drawn across it each time a fix is taken, and at regular intervals.
    2. The times of each fix and alteration of course inserted, and times of interval marks at not more than 15 minute intervals.
    3. The position of each fix and other recorded events inserted where possible, unless a GPS printout or separate list of times and corresponding positions is enclosed with the report.
    4. The recorded depths of all peak soundings inserted.
    5. The limits of the phase or scale change in which the set is running marked, noting particularly when a change is made.
    6. Name of ship, date, zone time used and scale reading of the shoaling edge of the transmission line should be marked on the trace. (diagram 8.14 in NP100)


Note 5

Views

New photographs should be obtained whenever possible and where a new view would help the mariner. An imperfect photograph, correctly annotated, can often be used to produce a view of considerable help to the mariner.

The various types of views and examples are given the following names:

    1. Panoramic. A composite view made up from a series of overlapping photographs. This type of view is intended to show the offshore aspect including hinterland.
    2. Pilotage. A single or composite view from the approach course to a harbour or narrows showing any leading marks, transits or conspicuous fixing marks. It may be combined with a close-up of the mark if necessary for positive identification.
    3. Portrait. The single view of a specific object set in its salient background.
    4. Close-up. Single views of one object or feature with emphasis on clarity of the subject for its identification.

The UKHO can supply a prioritised list of requirements for views that are needed for NP9. The Editor of the Antarctic Pilot is available to give advice on views required. (Telephone +44 (0)1823 337900 Ext 3480)


Note 6 

Sailing Directions. Proposed amendments to the text of the Antarctic Pilot are always welcome. No particular format is required, but a Hydrographic note (H102) is a convenient method of forwarding data.


Note 7

Any other observations, comments or remarks that the mariner thinks would improve charting coverage or the Sailing Directions is always gratefully received in the Hydrographic Office. Examples of these include transit notes and tracings or chart cuttings delineating areas of kelp. Constructive comments on chart coverage or the lack of it are useful for the future planning of charts and surveying.
