Scientific activities at Indian station “Maitri” during 2005 -2006

Introduction
This paper highlights the significant research activities carried out during winter as well as current austral summer.
Scientific activities during Winter period
The Antarctic Programme during the current winter over period involves scientific projects for understanding the key global processes by undertaking thematic research in different fields of Polar Science. “Maitri” station is the only high latitude Indian magnetic observatory occupying a crucial position at the fringe of the auroral oval. Magnetic data collected with Riometer and Digital Fluxgate Magnetometer, in 1sec, 1min and 1 hour sampling rates is used to understand the relation between magnetic storms and sub-storms and also to probe the geophysical processes which are happening in the auroralionosphere. Riometer gives the clue about the entry of the high energy particles through the polar cusp region, and the particle precipitation in the auroral ionosphere.
The declining trend of the Magnetic total field value is being monitored continuously with Proton Precision Magnetometer. In the last five decades, there is a substantial decrease in the total field value measuring more than 10,000 nT. It’s worth mentioning that the rate of decrease shows a declining trend for e.g. the rate of decrease was found to be about 200 nT, per year in  1996, about 100 nT per year around 2000 and the  current rate of decrease is  about 60 nT per year. The trend is being monitored continuously.
As part of Global Electric Circuit  experiments, we have Long wire Antenna to measure the weak current (Maxwell Currents) in the atmosphere which come from the bottom of the ionosphere. The vertical electric field of the atmosphere  were measured  with a field mill, at various climatic and magnetic conditions. The project of raising lake bottom sediment cores for multi–disciplinary investigations including palaeo-climatic, palaeontological, sedimentological, geochemical and, palynological studies along with TL dating of these glaciolacustrine sediments has  been implemented. A total of  21 sediment cores from different lakes  have been retrieved. These precious and  undisturbed sediment cores have a  potential of generating wealth of  scientific data up to the Last Glacial  Maxima. 
 During the period from January 2005 to September, seismic instruments both, analog and digital and GPS instruments (Ashtech & Turborogue)  were operated uninterruptedly for collecting the data. Preliminary analysis has been done for the earthquakes recorded by the instruments at Maitri and communicated to the USGS data center.
The climatic regime of Antarctica influences global climatic patterns, thus calling for a systematic data acquisition of various weather parameters. Synoptic meteorological data for global telecommunication system as a contribution to the international efforts for weather forecasting is being collected uninterruptedly.  Regular stratospheric ozonesonde ascents are being undertaken to study the vertical distribution of ozone, ozone hole phenomenon and effect of depletion of ozone in global climatic changes. Measurement of atmospheric total ozone, ground reaching UVB, NO2 and SO2 is being done with the help of Brewer Spectrophotometer. 
A systematic and thorough study of the human sleep patterns, melatonin secretion and biorhythm changes was carried out at Maitri during the polar wintering months. 
 Scientific activities during austral summer (2005 - 2006) period 
During the current austral summer period the following scientific activities were accomplished;
    • Two 400 mts profiles north-south and east-west using 200 MHz and 100 MHz Bi-static antenna were taken around the ice core drilling site at 71 deg 20’ 38” S and 11deg 35’ 38” E. An ice core output of 65.04 meters was recovered from the main borehole.  
    • 32 algal samples in different lakes of Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica, have been collected along with Water temp., pH, Salinity, TDS, Lat, Long and altitude of the collection point
    •  Identification and re observation 28 GPS stations completed. Approximately 2 Sq. Km. Area has been completed. 
    • Magnetotelluric (MT) investigations were carried out at 2 MT sites to the south of Maitri. MT data have been collected at every site for 5-6 days in frequency range 1000 to 0.0001 Hz.  
    • Construction of the Pier inside the seismic vault has been completed. 
    •  Bathymetric survey of Priiyadarshini Lake using echosounder  and   
    • Collection of two sediment cores from Priiyadarshini Lake. 
    • Collected the data from Riometer, Field mill, Passive antenna.  Made the comparative plots of the above data.  H.D.Z. data collected from digital fluxgate magnetometer.  Total Field (F) data collected using Proton Precision Magnetometer.  
    • Carried out fieldwork in the Shirmacher Oasis between Maitri and the western extremity point of the Oasis for geomorphological studies.
    • Thematic geological mapping and sampling around Humboldt pluton and the Sweissel  pluton were accomplished. 55 rock samples for geochemical and petrochemical studies were collected  
Monitoring of the fluctuations in the glacial snout and margin of the continent glacier were continued.
