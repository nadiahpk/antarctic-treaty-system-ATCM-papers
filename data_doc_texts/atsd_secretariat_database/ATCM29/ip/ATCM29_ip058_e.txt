Report of the CEP Observer to the twenty-fourth meeting of the Scientific Committee to CCAMLR, 24 to 28 October 2005
The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) Chair, Dr Tony Press (Australia), was the CEP observer at the twenty-fourth meeting of the Scientific Committee to Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (SC-CCAMLR) held from 24 to 28 October 2005.
The Scientific Committee was attended by all CCAMLR Members, except Poland.  Contracting Parties to the CAMLR Convention were invited to attend and Mauritius, the Netherlands, Cook Islands, Greece and Peru were represented.  As part of CCAMLR’s ongoing relationship-building efforts, a number of non-Contracting Parties with interests in fishing in the Convention Area or trade in toothfish were invited to attend; the People’s Republic of China did so.  Observers from ACAP, ASOC, CEP, CCSBT, COLTO, FAO, SEAFO, UNEP, WCPFC, IUCN, IWC and SCAR also attended.
This report highlights issues that may be of particular interest to the CEP including, where applicable, the response of the CAMLR Commission to the recommendations of the Scientific Committee.  The full report of the Scientific Committee meeting will shortly be publicly available on the CCAMLR Secretariat website at www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/sr/drt.htm.
Intersessional meetings of SC-CCAMLR
The Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM) met from 4 to 15 July 2005 in Yokohama, Japan.  The Working Group on Fish Stock Assessment (WG-FSA) met in Hobart prior to the Scientific Committee meeting, from 10 to 21 October 2005; a sub-group on Stock Assessment Methods (WG-FSA-SAM), was also held in Yokohama, Japan from 27 June to 1 July 2005.  An ad-hoc Working Group on Incidental Mortality Associated with Fishing (WG-IMAF) was conducted as part of the WG-FSA meeting.  The first meeting of Sub Group – Approaches to Stock Assessment and Modeling (SG-ASAM) met in La Jolla, USA from 31 May to 2 June 2005.  A workshop on Marine Protected Areas (WS-MPA) was held in Silver Springs, MD, USA from 29 August to 1 September 2005.
Issues arising
Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM)
Management of protected areas
The Scientific Committee considered the draft management plan for an Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) at Edmonson Point and the draft management plan for an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) at Admiralty Bay, which had been referred to CCAMLR by the proponents because they included potentially significant marine components.
    • The Scientific Committee recommended that the Commission approve the management plans for the Edmonson Point ASPA and the Admiralty Bay ASMA.  The Commission accepted these recommendations.
Krill-centric ecosystem
The Scientific Committee noted the following key challenges for future work of CCAMLR:
    • Potential influences of long-term change in the physical environment that underpin biological processes;
    • How to detect the consequential changes in biological systems in monitoring programs; and,
    • How to incorporate these into management.
Future work of WG-EMM
Following a review of land-based predator surveys, the Scientific Committee agreed that a workshop should be held to consider predator abundance.  An invitation will be extended for SCAR representatives to attend.
Marine Protected Areas
A workshop on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was held from 29 August to 1 September 2005 at NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, Silver Springs, MD, USA.
The Scientific Committee and Commission agreed that MPAs could be used to furthering the objectives of CCAMLR, and endorsed the recommendations arising from the workshop, particularly noting the need to:
    • develop a strategic approach to MPA design and implementation throughout the Southern Ocean; and 
    • collaborate with relevant bodies, including the CEP and ATCM, to further develop the MPA concept in the Southern Ocean.
The Commission also endorsed the Scientific Committee’s future work plan for developing a system of MPAs (see ATCM XXIX WP 7 The Work of CCAMLR on Marine Protected Areas).
Fisheries (WG-FSA)
Finfish resources
Twelve finfish fisheries, including seven exploratory fisheries were conducted under conservation measures in force in 2004/05.  These included fisheries for Dissostichus eleginoides and Champsocephalus gunnari in Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2, and exploratory fisheries for Dissostichus spp. in Subareas 48.6, 88.1 and 88.2 and Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2 and 58.4.3a and 58.4.3b.  Other fisheries for D. eleginoides occurred in Subarea 48.4 and in the EEZs of South Africa (Subareas 58.6 and 58.7) and France (Subarea 58.6 and Division 58.5.1) by longline vessels.
Toothfish
A total of 14 074 tonnes of Dissostichus spp. was taken in the Convention Area by 14 Members during the 2004/05 season, compared with 15 877 tonnes in the previous season.  Data reported in CCAMLR’s catch documentation scheme indicated that 8511 tonnes of Dissostichus spp. were taken outside the Convention Area in 2004/05, compared with 15 806 tonnes in the previous season.
Icefish
The total reported catch limit of mackerel icefish (C. gunnari) for the 2004/05 season was 5438 tonnes, compared with 2735 tonnes taken the previous season. These fisheries were to be undertaken in Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2.
Krill resources
A total catch of 124 535 tonnes of krill in the 2004/05 season was reported at the time of the Scientific Committee meeting, by five Members and one acceding State (Vanuatu), all in CCAMLR Area 48.  In comparison, the total catch for 2003/04 was 118 166 tonnes.  Six Members announced in advance their intention to fish for krill in the 2005/06 season, with a total catch of 245 000 tonnes. 
New and exploratory fisheries
In 2004/05, fishing occurred in seven exploratory longline fisheries for Dissostichus spp.  The Scientific Committee noted that fishing effort and catches were generally small, except for the exploratory fishery in Subarea 88.1, where 3079 tonnes were taken against a catch limit of 3250 tonnes.  For 2005/06, 12 Members submitted paid notifications for exploratory longline fisheries for Dissostichus spp.  The Commission noted with concern the large number of notifications for fishing in Subareas 88.1 (nine notifications for up to 21 vessels), 88.2 (eight notifications for up to 17 vessels) and Subarea 48.6 and Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2 and 58.4.3b (4-6 Members and 6- 11 vessels).
Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Convention Area
The Scientific Committee (WG-FSA) estimated that IUU toothfish catches for the 2004/05 fishing season totalled 2086 tonnes, compared with 2622 tonnes for the 2003/04 fishing season.  The Scientific Committee also noted an apparent decline (based on Catch Documentation Scheme records) of catches of Dissostichus spp. outside the Convention Area in 2004/05, from 10 966 tonnes in 2003/04 to 8511 in 2004/05.
To assist with the ‘Estimation of IUU catches in the Convention Area’, the Scientific Committee supported a proposal by the Standing Committee on Information and Compliance (SCIC) for an intersessional meeting of the Joint Assessment Group (JAG), scheduled for July 2006 in Nairobi.
Incidental mortality associated with fishing (WG-IMAF)
Marine mammals
The Scientific Committee noted that in the Convention Area in 2004/05, one Antarctic fur seal was caught and released alive in the icefish trawl fishery in Division 58.5.2.  In the krill fishery, data were available for one vessel fishing in Area 48, where 95 seals were entrapped of which 21 were killed.  The Scientific Committee endorsed advice to develop warp strike data collection protocols during the intersessional period and that at future meetings the ad hoc WG-IMAF assessments of incidental mortality of seabirds and marine mammals in the icefish, toothfish and krill trawl fisheries be undertaken collectively.
Seabirds
The Scientific Committee provided advice to the Commission on levels and rates of seabird by-catch in regulated longline fisheries in most parts of the Convention Area in 2004/05.  The extrapolated total of 97 seabirds was a 65% increase from the extrapolated 58 mortalities for 2003/04.  The vast majority of this increase is attributed to one vessel in Subareas 58.6 and 58.7.  The Scientific Committee commended the initiative taken by France for research and management relating to incidental seabird mortality in its EEZ. 
The Scientific Committee noted with concern considerably lower levels of compliance by fishing vessels with conservation measures aimed at preventing incidental mortality of seabirds.  The Scientific Committee recommended that vessels should make every effort to achieve or exceed earlier levels of compliance.  The Commission requested Members to ensure that their vessels complied with these measures.
The Scientific Committee estimated that seabird by-catch as a result of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing was 4415 birds.  The Scientific Committee advised the Commission that this estimate is the lowest so far made but that even these levels are of substantial concern and are probably unsustainable for some populations.
The Scientific Committee also noted that:
    • in the trawl fishery, seabird mortality rates had nearly doubled in 2004 in the icefish trawl fishery in Subarea 48.3 (87 birds killed and 136 released alive);
    • in 2004/05 only two seabird mortalities were reported in Division 58.4.1 as a result of exploratory longline fisheries; and
    • in krill fishing operations for 2004/05 only two seabird mortalities were recorded.
The Commission noted that together with the impact of IUU fishing, the greatest threat to seabirds breeding in the Convention Area is mortality in longline fisheries in waters outside the Convention Area.  The Scientific Committee and Commission noted that efforts since 2003 intended to communicate these concerns to other regional fisheries management organizations were relatively unsuccessful, and the Commission therefore adopted a Resolution (22/XXIII) on international actions to reduce the incidental mortality of seabirds arising from fishing.
The Scientific Committee noted that the total mortality of seabirds associated with longline fishing efforts in the CCSBT fishery could exceed 13 500 (including 10 000 albatrosses).  A request to members of CCAMLR was endorsed to support a thorough review of by-catch-related initiatives and requirements at the proposed meeting of the secretariats of the tuna RFMOs and their members.
Marine Debris
The Scientific Committee considered a report prepared by the Secretariat on surveys to monitor marine debris and its impact on marine mammals and seabirds.  The Scientific Committee noted that:
    • marine debris at Bird Island (South Georgia), and Signy Island (South Orkney Islands) peaked in 1994 to 1996, however there was an increase in the amount of debris recorded in 2003/04 (86% at Signy Island and 97% at Bird Island);
    • 95% of debris found at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island was plastic;
    • marine mammal entanglement at Bird Island peaked in 1993 and has declined since; Nine entanglements were recorded at Bird Island in 2004/05 which is the lowest recorded number since 1991;
    • two marine mammal (Antarctic fur seal) entanglements were reported at Signy Island; and
    • six seabirds suffering hydrocarbon contamination at Bird Island were recorded.
Specially Protected Species
The CEP Observer conveyed the CEP’s request for the Scientific Committee to provide information on the proposal from SCAR to remove sub-Antarctic and Antarctic fur seals from the Appendix A of Annex II of the Protocol. The CEP Observer undertook to forward the revised SCAR proposal, when available, to the CCAMLR Secretariat to arrange for review of the proposal by Members and appropriate CCAMLR experts. The Scientific Committee was provided with the Guidelines for CEP Consideration of Proposals for New and Revised Designations of Antarctic Specially Protected Species under Annex II of the Protocol. 

A CEP Observer has been invited to participate in the next Scientific Committee meeting in October 2006 (SC-CCAMLR-XXV).
