Guidelines for the
Preparations of Notifications
Related to Consultative Party Status
In light of the interest of a number of acceding
parties in becoming Consultative Parties, the United States
believes that it would be useful for the 14th Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting to adopt guidelines for the
preparation of notifications on Consultative Party status.
Such guidelines, could not in any way be an interpretation
of Article IX, 2., but would assist the acceding party in
preparing its notification and providing relevant informa-
tion.  They would also aid the Consultative Parties in
carrying out their responsibilities under the agreed proce-
dures, i.e., in determining whether there is a commitment
to substantial scientific research activity in Antarctica.
To this end, the United States believes that an acceding
Party's provision of "information concerning its activities
in the Antarctic, in particular the content and objectives
of its scientific program", pursuant to the procedures
would be facilitated if guidelines were adopted calling for
its notification to include a complete description of:

(1) its past scientific programs and activities
in Antarctica including published results or
studies;

(2) its ongoing and planned scientific programs
and activities in Antarctica, including how
they relate to long-term scientific objecti-
ves;  and

(3) planning, management, and execution of its
scientific programs and activities in
Antarctica, including identification of the
governmental and non-governmental institu-
tions involved.

The United States envisions that the guidelines
proposed could be adopted as part of the report of  ATCM XIV.
