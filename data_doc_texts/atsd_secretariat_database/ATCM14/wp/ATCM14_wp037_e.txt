AGENDA ITEM 9

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION TO THE AGREED MEASURES FOR THE
CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA TO PROVIDE FOR
THE PREPARATION AND ADOPTION OF MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR
SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS; AND

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE FOR DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL
RESERVES TO PROTECT AREAS OF OUTSTANDING GEOLOGICAL, SCENIC,
RECREATIONAL, OR WILDERNESS INTEREST.

Submitted by the delegation of the United States
ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS

1. Management Plants for SPAs

The United States supports the third recommendation
in the report of the SCAR ad hoc group on additional pro-
tective measures calling for preparation and agreement on
management plans for existing and future Specially Protec-
ted Areas. The United States also supports routine review
of those plans by SCAR prior to submission to the ATCPs
for adoption.  In our view, the XIV ATCM should agree to
require preparation of such plans, while seeking further
guidance on what specific information should be included
in such plans. We believe that specific guidelines should
be considered at the XV ATCM along with draft management
plans and the reports on SPAs, SSSIs, and Historic monuments
called for in response to the first recommendation
of the SCAR ad hoc group. A draft recommendation is
attached to amend Article VIII of the Agreed Measures to
provide for management plans for SPAs.

2. Additional Protective Arrangements

a. The United States also supports provision for means
to deal with potential conflicts of use due to the increas-
ed intensity and variety of activities in Antarctica, in-
cluding tourism.  For this reason the U.S. supports the
development of techniques - including area management - 
to deal with multiple use situations and their cumulative
impacts and looks forward to consideration of more detail-
ed presentations on how to address such situations.  We
do not believe that the proposals described below are in
any way incompatible with development of Antarctic Protec-
ted Areas to deal with such situations, as applications
of such areas are clarified in the future.

b. The United States believes in addition that there
are areas of Antartica that merit special protection by
virtue of their outstanding scenic beauty, wilderness
- 2 -

value, potential for recreational activities, or geological 
interest.  In our view, Article VIII of the Agreed Measures 
permits designations for these non-biological purposes.

Other delegations take the view that Specially Protected 
Areas may not be used for non-biological purposes.  With this 
view in mind, and in order to obtain agreement on means to 
provide protection of areas for other than biological purposes, 
the United States proposes the attached Recommendation on a 
new single purpose category of protected area to be used 
solely to protect areas of outstanding scenic, wilderness, 
geological, or other value.

Moreover, in the United States view, designations of 
protected areas for the purpose of protecting an area for 
a single purpose (scenic beauty, wilderness value, potential 
for recreational activities, geological interest) is com-
pletely compatible with later agreement on establishment 
of Antarctic Protected Areas providing for management of 
more than one activity and protected status for more 
extensive areas of Antarctica.
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION TO THE AGREED MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA TO PROVIDE FOR THE PREPARATION AND ADOPTION OF MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS:
The Representatives,

Recalling that Antarctica is considered a Special Conser-
vation Area pursuant to the Agreed Measures for the Conser-
vation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;

Bearing in mind  and welcoming the Report of the SCAR ad hoc
Group on Additional Protective Measures submitted to ATCM XIV
in response to Recommendation XIII-5, and in particular its
proposal that a management plan for each existing and all
future Specially Protected Areas should be prepared and agreed;

Without prejudice to further consideration of  the other
proposals of the SCAR ad hoc group;

Recommend to their Governments that:

They amend as follows the Agreed Measures for the Conserva-
tion of Antarctic Fauna and Flora annexed to Recommendation III-8:
      Add a new paragraph 5 to Article VIII:

"Proposals to designate Specially Protected Areas shall
be accompanied by a management plan which accurately
describes the location and unique features of the area
in question; the types of scientific or other activities
that would or would not be compatible with the proposed
designation; any special precautions that should be taken
when carrying out particular activities in or near the
area; and the means whereby the status of the designated
area would be monitored."
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE FOR DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL
RESERVES TO PROTECT AREAS OF OUTSTANDING GEOLOGICAL, SCENIC,
RECREATIONAL, OR WILDERNESS INTEREST:



Submitted by the delegation
of the United States
The Representatives,

Recalling that Antarctica is considered a Special Conservation Area pursuant to the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;

Recalling in addition  that Recommendations I-9, III-8 and VII-3 provide for the designation and protection of historic sites and monuments, of unique ecological systems of outstanding scientific interest, and of Sites of Special Scientific Interest;

Bearing in mind  and welcoming the Report of the SCAR ad hoc Group on Additional Protective Measures submitted to XIV ATCM in response to Recommendation XIII-5;

Desiring in addition to provide for the protection of unique natural ecological systems of outstanding geological, recreational, scenic, or wilderness interest;

Without prejudice to further consideration of the recommendations of the SCAR ad hoc group;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Areas of outstanding geological, scenic, recreational, or wilderness interest be designated Special Reserves in order to protect and preserve these values:

2. Proposals to designate such areas be accompanied by a management plan which accurately describes:

    a. the location and unique features of the area in question;
b. the types of scientific or other activities that 
would or would not be compatible with the proposed 
designation,
c. any special precautions that should be taken when 
carrying out particular activities in or near the 
area, and
d. the means whereby the status of the designated 
area would be monitored.

3. They seek further guidance on the specific information 
to be included in management plans; and

4. They invite SCAR, through their national committees, 
to review the management plans before they are submitted 
to the Consultative Parties for adoption.
