ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

The Representatives,

Recalling Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommenda-
tions VI-3, X-3 and XII-1;

Noting the Final Report of the World Meteorological Organiza-
tion (WMO) Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic Me-
teorology, Fourth Session (EC/WGAM-IV) and action taken by
the WMO Tenth Congress relating to Antarctic Meteorology.

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Having regard to Recommendation 6. and 8 of EC/WGAM-IV
(reproduced at Annex C To the Final Report of ATCM XIV),
They accept Annex I to this Recommendation as a current
statement of the Basic Synoptic network and the network of
Climat and Climat Temp Reporting Stations in the Antarctic
and that, as a consequence, Annex I to Recommendation XII-1
be withdrawn;

2. Annexes 1, 2 and 3 to Recommendation X,3 and Annexes 2
and 3 to Recommendation XII-1 be withdrawn and replaced
by Annexes 2 and 3 to this Recommendation as a current
statement of the "existing links for the daily international
exchange of meteorological data within the Antarctic" and
the "Principal routes by which Antarctic meteorological data
enter the GTS" (Global Telecommunications System of the
WMO World Weather Watch);
3. Annexes I and II to Recommendation VI-3 be withdrawn and replaced by Annexes 4 and 5 to this Recommendation as current statements of Requirements for Observational Data and Requirements for Processed Information;

4- Having regard to paragraph 4.1 and Annex I to the Final Report of EC/WGAM-IV (reproduced at Annex D is the Final Report of ATCM XIV), they:

a) Respond expeditiously in respect of Paragraph 288, sub-paragraphs (a) and (e);

b) request EC/WGAM to identify areas of difficulty is respect of telecommunications links for meteorological purposes within the Antarctic region and between Antarctica and the GTS and to see if, through exercise of their good offices, such difficulties can be resolved;

c) be ready to consider the possibility of a meeting of experts, convened in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, in the light of the outcome of action in accordance with sub-paragraph (b) above;

d) respond positively to requests received in accordance with sub-paragraph (b) and (c) of paragraph 289, subject to over-riding scientific, administrative or budgeting considerations;

e) respond to sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 289 in the understanding that the objective of Antarctic Meteorological Centres, whether they be situated inside or outside the Antarctic region is to facilitate efficient and safe Antarctic operations, to assist in ensuring that countries outside the Antarctic Treaty Area obtain maximum benefit from Antarctic meteorological observations, that such activities are wholly consistent with the principles and purposes of the Antartic Treaty and that, therefore, the designation of such centres is fully covered by Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty.
