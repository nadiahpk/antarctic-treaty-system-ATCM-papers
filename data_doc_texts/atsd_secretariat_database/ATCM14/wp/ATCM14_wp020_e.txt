AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES RENDERED BY CHILE IN THE ANTARCTICA

a) - In 1976, during the CAR/SAM Regional Meeting held in 
Lima, Peru, the Chilcan Delegation expressed concern 
with the lack of adequate services in places such as 
the Antarctic, where air operations were swiftly 
increasing. With that in view, it offered to expand 
its Punta Arenas FIR to the South Pole, undertaking 
responsibility for Air Traffic Services between 53° 
and 90° West.

Later, in 1983, during the II ASIA/PAC Regional 
Meeting in Singapore, Chile undertook responsibility 
to expand the Easter Islands Oceanic FIR to the 
South Pole, between 90° and 120° West.

b) - Features of the Air Traffic Control System controlled 
by Chile.

The Air Traffic Services rendered by the Chilean FIRs 
is internationally available to all signatory coun-
tries of the OACI, pursuant  to the norms and 
recommendations enforced by this United Nations 
entity.

c) - The Communications System of the Lieutenant Marsh 
Base

Based on international and national frequencies (HF 
and VHF) as determined by the Caribbean Air Navigation 
Regional Plan - South America.

d) - Features of the Lieutenant Marsh Airfield - King 
George Island.

g) - The Punta Arenas Area Control Center has a current agree
ment with the Comodoro Rivadavia ACC in order to 
determine air traffic coordination procedures at the
points where airways from the Continent - whether
from Chile or from Argentina (Punta Arenas and Como-
doro Rivadavia) - converge.

There are no other agreements with any other
countries, but air traffic is normally coordinated
with New Zealand - which is in charge of a Flight
Zone separated from the Easter Islands by a NoFIR
zone - by means of standard procedures adopted by
the signatory countries of the OACI.

h) - SAR

Pursuant to the OACI norms, the Chilean Search and
Rescue and Alert Service is in charge of planes that
operate within the Punta Arenas and Easter FIRs
(to the Pole) whenever these have previously sub-
mitted their flight plans.

For this purpose, Chile maintains the following
Search and Rescue planes in the Antarctic: UH 1 H
short range helicopters; long range DHC 6, available
in the Arturo Merino Benítez Airport; long-range
C-130 capable of reaching the King George Islands in
6 hours.

i) - The General Management of the Chilean Civil Aero-
nautics has the required communications equipment
(HF frequencies) to contact McMurdock, Siple Station,
when activated with Easter Island and New Zealand.
