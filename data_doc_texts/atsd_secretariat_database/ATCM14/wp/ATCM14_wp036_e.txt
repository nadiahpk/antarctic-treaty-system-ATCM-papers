ITEM 9

MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

PAPER SUBMITTED BY THE CHILEAN DELEGATION
Under the item related to Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment, the XIIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting adopted Recommendation XIII-6 and in its Final Report suggested that continued attention should be given to the subject of the concentration of activities in some parts of the Antarctic (i.e. King George Island).

SCAR has recorded in its Reports its concern that the continued increase in number of stations in some parts of the Antarctic could result in unproductive duplication of scientific programmes. It has also suggested that operating agencies or national committees give adequate prior notice of intent to undertake a development or scientific activity that is likely to have a major environmental impact; and has expressed the hope that its response to Recommendation XII-3, on impact assessment procedures, may contribute to avoid problems that might arise from contiguous stations.

The constant increase in world interest in the Antarctic and the consequent effort of the Consultative Parties to expand the scope of their research has resulted in a growth of logistic support activities fluctuating from 1 to 5%. Whilst in the winter of 1985 there were 34 stations in operation with a total number of 900 persons (not including 8 stations situated north of 60? S) during the austral summer of 1985/86, some 45 stations operated with a total of 2.700 persons, 40 vessels and an important number of aircraft and land transport facilities.

The enclosed draft recommendation is intended to address some of these concerns, with a particular emphasis on the protection of the environment, the enhancement of the quality of scientific research and the development of new patterns of cooperation which may contribute to lay the ground for a more coordinated approach to the management of human activities and the coordination of scientific research in the Antarctic.

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty,
2.

Recalling Recommendations I-II, VI-4, VI-1, VIII-11, VIII-13,
IX-5, X-4, XII-3, XII-4, XIII-5, and XIII-6.

Aware that the levels of research activity and related logistic
support have increased and are expected to rise even more in the
Antarctic,

Desiring to ensure that those activities should not harm the
unique Antarctic environment, its dependent and associated
ecosystems disrupt scientific investigation or other legitimate
uses or be otherwise contrary to the principles and purposes of
the Antarctic Treaty,

Conscious of the need to avoid the effects of potential harmfull
interference and to actively consider, through consultation and
coordination, ways and means to reduce adverse environmental impacts
and interferences, as well as the scope of the area impacted and
the cumulative effect of the impact,

Desirous to improve the quality of Antarctic Science, its
accessibility and comparability, cost-effectiveness and efficiency
through wider collaboration in the planning and execution of
scientific activities in the Antarctic,

Noting that SCAR has recorded its concern that the continued
increase in number of stations in some parts of the Antarctic
could result in unproductive duplication of scientific programmes,
and that it has recommended that operating agencies or national
committees give adequate prior notice of intent to undertake a
development or scientific activity that is likely to have a major
environmental impact,

Noting as well that SCAR has agreed to explore through the
establishment of a new working group on Biological Investigations
of Terrestrial Antarctic System (BIOTAS) means to improve
coordination of new projects, avoid unnecessary duplication,
attempt a more unified approach where national programmes may
interrelate and complement each other, and establish research
sites associated with scientific stations to further concentrate 
scientific studies and allow biological and environmental changes 
induced by  human activity to be monitored.

Recommend to their Governments that, through their National 
Committees, they request SCAR to advise on:

- steps that possibly could be taken to improve coordination 
and cooperation in the location and use of stations and other 
scientific support facilities in the Antarctic, including 
guidelines by SCAR on areas in which research has not yet been 
conducted and which would be usefull to know  when considering 
the installation of new stations or other scientific facilities,

- the introduction of zoning schemes for delimiting specific sites 
and uses, allowing stations to expand in a manner consistent 
with the attainment of the objectives for which they were 
installed and thereby contributing to improve their cooperation 
and mutual assistance,

- a code of conduct devised to resolve questions concerning waste 
disposal, electromagnetic disturbance, the use of drinking water, 
aspects of land-use and related transport facilities, and to 
prevent multiple uses from developing into conflicts,

- the possibilities and opportunities for further coordination 
of scientific and/or logistic facilities within the  framework 
of the Antarctic Treaty System.
