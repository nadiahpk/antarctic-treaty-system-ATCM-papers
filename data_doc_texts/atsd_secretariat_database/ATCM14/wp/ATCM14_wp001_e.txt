WORKING PAPER

AIR SAFETY IN ANTARCTICA

Increasing air activity in Antarctica gave rise to discuss between air operators the problem of maintaining the safety of  air operations in the Antarctic.  As there is no general air  traffic control system in Antarctica, flying in this region in general  is visual flying.

The need for some kind of air traffic control in Antarctica had been identified at SCAR XVIII, Bremerhaven 1984.  The issue was raised again during SCAR XIX  in San Diego 1986.  SCAR requested the Secretary-General of ICAO to give information on ICAO rules, regulations and procedures.  Although flight information regions have been accepted, virtually all air space in Antarctica is still uncontrolled.  The SCAR Working Group on Logistics, which discusses the problem of air Safety in Antarctica regularly, has suggested that experts  in Antarctic air operations should discuss guidelines  for the conduct of air operations.  A special meeting of the SCAR Logistics Working Group which will only concentrate on the issue of air safety in Antarctica will be held this July in Boulder/Colorado.

In view of the increasing air traffic in Antarctica  the Federal Republic of Germany considers a satisfactory solution of the problem of air safety as an important issue and welcomes the efforts made by SCAR in this respect.  As a first step in establishing  an Antarctic-wide  air safety system, it may be appropriate and sufficient that Antarctic air operators agree on a common satellite  radio

frequency.  There seems to be a tendency to prefer a satellite bound 
system to traditional air safety systems.  Air safety in Antarctica 
should further be improved by an extension of landing assistance 
facilities.

The delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore 
proposes to inscribe on the Agenda of the XIVth ATCM and item entitled 
"Air Safety in Antarctica".
