(working paper submitted by the Australian Delegation)

Paper may be made publicly available
AUSTRALIAN INSPECTIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII OF THE

ANTARCTIC TREATY

1. Inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty
are now a regular feature of Australia's Antarctic Program.
Teams composed of officers from the Australian Antarctic
Division and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have
conducted inspections in the 1985/86 and 1986/87 summer seasons.

2. The reports on these inspections have been distributed
to Contracting Parties through diplomatic channels. The
Australian Delegation has a copy of each of the reports and
these are available for perusal by any interested Delegation.

3. The importance which Australia attaches to inspections is
underlined in the attached press release by the Australian
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Bill Hayden, MP,
on 3 January, 1986.

4. Australia believes it important that more use be made of
the Treaty's inspection provisions, in order to promote the
objectives and ensure compliance with the Treaty. Australia
has found that inspections have a useful rule to play in
facilitating cooperation and exchange of information and ideas
on Antarctic operations.

VISIT OF AUSTRALIAN INSPECTION TEAM TO ANTARCTICA

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill Hayden, MP, announced today that Australia has dispatched an inspection team to Antarctica in accordance with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty.

The Australian inspection team comprises officers of the Department of Science and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The inspection team is travelling on one of the vessels resupplying Australia's three Antarctic stations. Upon completion of the inspection, the team will prepare a report which will be distributed to all Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, as provided for in the Treaty.

Under the terms of the Antarctic Treaty, each Consultative Party to the Treaty has the right to designate observers who shall have complete freedom of access to all areas of Antarctica, including all stations and installations there.

Mr Hayden said that this inspection system is designed to promote the objectives and ensure the observance of the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty.  These include the reservation of Antarctica exclusively for peaceful purposes, with a prohibition upon military activities, nuclear explosions and disposal of nuclear waste there; freedom of scientific research in Antarctica and the exchange of plans for, and the results of, such research; and the conservation of living resources and the protection of the unique Antarctic environment.

"The exercise of rights of inspection under the Antarctic Treaty is an important means of demonstrating the value of the Treaty as an effective international instrument for the regulation of states' activity in Antarctica in the interest of all mankind.  It is planned that the exercise of its rights of inspection under the Antarctic Treaty should become a regular part of Australia's Antarctic activities."

Mr Hayden noted that inspection visits by Consultative Parties in Antarctica traditionally take place in an amicable and co-operative atmosphere characteristic of the operation of the Antarctic Treaty system.  Previous inspections have found no evidence of violations of either the letter or the spirit of the Treaty.  The inspection system is an important part of the contribution of the Antarctic Treaty to international understanding and co-operation.
