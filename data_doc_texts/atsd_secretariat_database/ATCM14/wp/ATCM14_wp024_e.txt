I.  FEATURES

- pocket size leaflet of up to 20 pages
- attractive, easy-to-read layout (may include diagrams,
  photos and colours)
- quality printing
- enough issues to reach a maximum of addresses at the
  several population levels.
- Languages: initially, at least in the four official
  languages of the Antarctic Treaty and, later, in the
  largest possible number of languages.
- From time to time, new editions (and, eventually, up-
  dating) to allow for "collection" (maybe in the loose-
  leaf form).

II. CONTENTS

- Two major titles: general and scientific

  achievements gained by compliance with an implementa

- The first issue will present a general view of the
  Antarctic Treaty's merits and of attained targets.
- The following issues could present specific themes,
  such as: pacification, de-nuclearization, scientific
  and other instances of cooperation, environmental
  conservation, etc.
- individual issues could be published on each branch of
  Antarctic sciences, such as: soil sciences (glaciology,
-2

oceanography,geology); air sciences (meteorology);
biological sciences (biology, human and animal phy-
siology).
