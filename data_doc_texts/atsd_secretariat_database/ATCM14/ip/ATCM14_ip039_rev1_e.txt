PROCEDURE REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF RECOMMENDATIONS

We address here the procedure in China regarding 
the approval of adopted recommendations.  The recommendations 
adopted at ATCMs should be firstly subject to careful study 
by relevant government agencies, such as Foreign Ministry, 
the National Committee for Antarctic Research and others.  
Foreign Ministry and the National Committee for Antarctic 
Research will together submit a report to the State Council 
proposing approval of the recommendations, accompanied by the 
recommendations to be approved.  The State Council will then, 
on the basis of the report, approve the recommendations and 
the Foreign Ministry will notify the Depos.tory Government 
of the Antarctic Treaty.
