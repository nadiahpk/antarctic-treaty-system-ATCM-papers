REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF FOURTH SPECIAL CONSULTATIVE
MEETING ON ANTARCTIC MINERALS
REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF FOURTH SPECIAL CONSULTATIVE
MEETING ON ANTARCTIC MINERALS

This report is presented in accordance with paragraph
2(a) of Recommendation XIII-2 adopted at Brussels.

2       The first session of the Fourth Special
Consultative Meeting on Antarctic Minerals was held
in Wellington, New Zealand from 14 to 25 June 1982,
in accordance with Recommendation XI-I adopted at
Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Since then a further nine
negotiating sessions, mostly informal, have been
held.

3       The most recent session was held at Montevideo
from 11 to 20 May 1987.  As at previous sessions
of the negotiations, the bulk of the work was carried
out in working groups.  Mr Rolf Andersen of Norway
continued to chair the working group charged with
examining the functioning of the minerals regime
should the stage of exploration and development
ever be reached, and the requirement that the fundamental
environmental principles on which the regime is to
based are given full effect at all stages of
any activity.

4       A second Working Group, chaired by Mr Ruediger
Wolfrum of the Federal Republic of Germany continued
its work on the legal aspects of the minerals regime.
At Montevideo it concentrated on the questions of
liability for damage, particularly to the Antarctic
environment, and the elaboration of procedures for
the settlement of disputes.

5       The Chairman held informal discussions on
the key institutional issues, including the composition
and functions of the various organs of the regime.

6       It was the view of all participants that very
substantial progress had been made at the Montevideo
meeting.  Accordingly, it was decided by the participants
that a final session of the Special Consultative
Meeting should be held in Wellington, New Zealand
in the first half of 1988 in order to adopt a Convention.
It was also decided that the Chairman should conduct
consultations to fix precise dates for the final
session and to establish a schedule for the necessary
preparatory work, including the establishment of
a drafting committee.
