OZONE MEASUREMENTS IN THE ANTARCTIC ATMOSPHERE

Information Paper submitted by
the Delegation of Argentina
NEW STATION FOR OZONE MEASUREMENT IN ANTARCTICA

(The following is a News Bulletin issued by the National
Meteorological Service)

The National Meteorological Service, an agency of
the Argentine Air Force, has opened a new station for the
measurement of ozone in the atmosphere.

One Dobson spectrophotometer, a special instrument
for this purpose, was set up at the Antarctic Meteorological
Center "Vicecomodoro Marambio" sited in the homonymous station
which the Air Force operates in the Antartida Argentina.

Ozone (O    ) is a gas present in very small quantities
in the atmosphere. Its maximum concentration occurs between 15
and 20 km. high (ozonosphere) and plays a very important role
in the preservation of the balance of atmospheric radiation,
mainly through the absortion of ultraviolet sun radiation.

As publicly known, recent evidence observed in
other Antarctic stations indicates that the total column ozone
over the Antarctic has experienced a considerable 40% decrease
between 1957 and 1984. This phenomenon, known as the Antarctic
"ozone hole", which has not yet found scientific explanation,
occurs only during Antarctic spring from August to November.

There are only 75 Dobson stations in operation in
the world, 25 of which are located in the Southern Hemisphere.
Two of the latter are sited in Argentina: one in the Buenos

Aires Central Meteorological Observatory (Villa Ort√∫zar), in operation.since 1966, and the other recently set up in Antarctica ("Vicecomodoro Marambio" station). A third similar instrument will be set up in the near future at the Meteorological Station "Lago Fagnano"(Tierra del Fuego). In this way the National Meteorological Service will complement its observation and research program, to contribute to the study of this phenomenon which both worries the scientific community and causes concern to all humankind.
