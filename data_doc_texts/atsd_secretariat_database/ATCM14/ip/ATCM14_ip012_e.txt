ITEM 6

OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM :
MATTERS ARISING UNDER ARTICLE IX OF THE TREATY

PROCEDURES LEADING TO THE APPROVAL BY AUSTRALIA OF
RECOMMENDATIONS OF ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

(submitted by the Australian Delegation)

Available for immediate Public Release
The process of approval of the Recommendations of an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting by Australia begins with the receipt of a certified copy of the Recommendations, usually as part of the Final Report of the Meeting. The text of the Recommendations is compared with the records of the delegation to that meeting. If this examination is satisfactory, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade then writes to other relevant Ministers to enable the implications (including legislative action) of implementation to be determined.

Once other Ministers are satisfied that Australia is in a position to implement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is advised of their agreement to the approval of the Recommendations. On receipt of the letters of agreement from all relevant Ministers, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade formally approves the Recommendations, except those requiring legislative action, and the Depository and other Treaty Parties are notified. By this process, the relevant Ministers accept responsibility for ensuring compliance with particular Recommendations through the appropriate areas of their Departments.

Recommendations requiring legislative action are treated as interim guidelines until the necessary legislation is in place, at which time they are substantively approved.

Australia has approved all Recommendations of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings. The Recommendations of ATCM XIII were approved in February 1987 and the Depository and all Treaty Parties were notified through diplomatic channels.
