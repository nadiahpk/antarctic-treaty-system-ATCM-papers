ANTARCTIC ICEBERG OBSERVATIONS

Sea ice and icebergs are hazardous to ships traversing
the Southern Ocean. Sea ice surrounds most of the Antarctic
Continent even in the best shipping season from January to
March. Icebreakers and ice strengthened ships are therefore
used on most routes to Antarctica.

Ships with lower strength  avoid the sea ice covered
waters, and generally  stay north of the  sea  ice  limit,
which now can be well monitored by satellites  and  other
remote sensing techniques.

Icebergs can be found far north of the sea ice. Grow-
lers, which are small bergs of solid ice, and which may not
be observed visually or by radar  in  heavy  seas, can  be
especially hazardous to ships. The distribution  of  large
and small icebergs is therefore particularly valuable  for
the  choice  of routes of ships that do not have  ice
protection. For example, commercial ships  could  shorten
their travel between southern ports by choosing southerly routes
along Great Circles, if they could rely  on  avoiding ice
hazards.

The SCAR Working Group on Glaciology initiated in 1981
a programme of Antarctic iceberg observations.  Ships travel-
ling to and from Antarctica use "blue forms" on which observed
icebergs are recorded every six hours.  The icebergs are
classified according to size, and large icebergs are described
individually.  At the end of their voyage the forms are sent
to Norsk Polarinstitu[?]tt (The Norwegian Polar Research
Institute) in Oslo, which put the data on file.  Ships  of
nearly all Antarctic Treaty nations take part in this work,
and the data set has grown very rapidly.  The position of only
- 2 -

about 5000 icebergs had been recorded prior to 1981.  Today
the file contains data on over 100,000 icebergs.  The data
has wide uses for scientific purposes, such as evaluation of
the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and investiga-
tion of source regions and currents based on the large
geographic variations in iceberg density.

However, the data also have operational value.  The
following figure shows the density of icebergs now observed
around Antarctica. Superimposing the position of the
Antarctic Convergence on this figure shows that there are
very few icebergs observed north of the Convergence, whereas
the density is high in most areas south of it.  From this we
can conclude that ships without ice strength can move with
reasonable safety as long as they stay north of the
Convergence.

Continued participation in the iceberg observation
programme will lead to further knowledge of the iceberg
distribution, and improved ability to inform on iceberg
hazards to ships in the southern ocean.

This figure shows the density of icebergs around Antarctica, based on all iceberg:
data on file at Norsk Polarinstitutt in September 1987.  The amount of hatching shows  how
many icebergs are likely to be seen within a 12 n mile radius, and are shown for grid boxes
measuring 2° in latitude and 5° in longitude.  The darkest hatching indicate that more than
20 icebergs are obsered on the average.  Areas where no icebergs have been seen by passing
ships are marked with "0".  Blank grid boxes indicate no observations.  Note that the
density of icebergs is not uniform around the continent; for example the ship observations
show that there are very few icebergs around 30° E.  Also the iceberg density do not decrease
uniformly with distance from the coast.  Ocean currents are the main causes for these variations.
The most northerly icebergs seen so far were between 42° S and 44° S; 3000 km north of the
continent.  These were a freak occurrence and represented the remnants of a huge iceberg of
2000 km² area. Apart from this, very few icebergs have been seen north of the Antarctic
Convergence.
