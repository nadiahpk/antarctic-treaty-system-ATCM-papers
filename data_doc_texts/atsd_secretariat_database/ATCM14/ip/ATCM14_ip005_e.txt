ITEM 6

OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM:
MATTERS ARISING UNDER ARTICLE IX OF

THE TREATY

UNITED KINGDOM PROCEDURES LEADING TO APPROVAL
OF ANTARCTIC TREATY RECOMMENDATIONS

(Submitted by the UNITED KINGDOM Delegation)
United Kingdom procedures leading to the acceptance of 
the Recommendations of Consultative Meetings follow the receipt 
from the host Government of the English language text of the 
Final Report of each ATCM.  All the Recommendations contained 
within that Report are then published as a White Paper and 
presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Foreign 
and Commonwealth Affairs.  Copies of the White Paper are 
circulated to other government departments for comment.

ATCM Recommendations are not approved until they have 
been presented to Parliament and have then been accepted 
by the relevant government departments.  Moreover, any 
Recommendation that seeks to prohibit certain acts and 
activities must first be given the force of law in the 
United Kingdom.  It has been United Kingdom practice to 
approve Recommendations of a hortatory nature after these 
have been presented to Parliament and have been found 
administratively acceptable.  Recommendations requiring 
legislative action have been accepted as interim guidelines 
until such action has been completed;  they have then been 
substantively approved.

The United Kingdom has formally approved all Recommendations 
of the past thirteen Consultative Meetings except IV-12, VI-8, 
VII-5, and XIII-10 to 13.  Recommendations VII-5 and XIII-10 to 13 
have been approved as interim guidelines pending completion of 
legislative action.  IV-12 was terminated by Recommendation VIII-2 
and Recommendation VI-8 was terminated by VIII-5.
