ABOUT THAT COMPANY'S PROPOSED ANTARCTIC TOURIST CRUISES

Information Paper submitted by
the Delegation of  Argentina
EXTRACT FROM A LETTER DATED 13th AUGUST 1987 FROM THE GENERAL 
DIRECTORATE FOR ANTARCTIC AFFAIRS , MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
AND WORSHIP, TO "CRUZADAS ARGENTINAS S.R.L."


"I refer to a series of press advertisements published 
in this Capital, with relation to a program of seven Antarctic 
cruises to take place between December 1987 and February 1988 on 
board the ship "Mediterranean Sky", which identifies your Company 
as the responsible operator.

In this connection, I wish to recall the fact that the 
Argentine Republic, as Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty, 
is bound by the provisions therein contained. In particular, I 
draw your attention to the provisions related to Antarctic tourism 
and incumbent on Argentina by virtue of Articles VII.5(a) and X 
VIII-9, X-8 and XII-3 (copies enclosed).

In the first place, the Argentine Government must 
provide advance information to other Treaty Parties on all 
Antarctic expedition organised in, proceeding from or calling at 
its territory (Article VII.5 (a) of the Antarctic Treaty and 
Recommendations IV-27 (1) and VI-7 (3)). In consequence, I would 
very much appreciate the prompt submittal of a detail of your 
planned activities, containing the relevant information listed in 
Annex C to Recommendation VIII-9, in order to enable this Ministry 
to make a timely information exchange.

By virtue of the above mentioned provisions, Argentina 
must exert appropriate efforts to ensure that all visitors do not 
engage in any activity in Antarctica contrary to the objectives 
and principles of the Antarctic Treaty and its Recommendations 
(Article X of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations IV-27.3, 
VI-7.1,  VII-4.4). In this respect, I attach a synthesis of the 
main provisions applicable to visitors to the Antarctic Treaty 
area, contained in the "Statement of Accepted Practices and the 
Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty", Annex A to 
Recommendation  VII-9 (adopted by Recommendation X-8.1). This 
Statement should be adequately brought to the attention of all 
participants in the cruises, tourists as well as crew.

In addition, it should be noted that visits to stations 
can only be made if priorly requested and upon the issuing of the 
corresponding permission, and observing in each case the special 
conditions or restrictions which might be stipulated by the 
respective Antactic Treaty Party (Recommendations IV-27.2, VI-7.2 
and VIII-9.2 (a)). Any request of authorisation to visit Argentine 
stations should be addressed to the National Antarctic Directorate. 
I would be grateful if you would let me have information, as soon 
as possible, on the foreign Antarctic stations which are envisaged 
to be visited during the course of these cruises, so that this
Ministry can notify such intention to the  Governments of the 
respective Antarctic Treaty Parties, in accordance with para-
graph 1 of Recommendation IV-27.

May I also stress the need of a careful organisation 
of Antarctic tourism, in the light of the special characterist-
ics of the area and the measures in force related to the protect-
ion of the environment and of the continuing scientific invest-
igations. This determines the importance of carrying experts, 
scientists and tour guides experienced in Antarctic conditions 
and with a complete understanding of the conservation measures 
applicable in the area (Recommendation X-8.II). Identical con-
siderations underlie the need of carrying adequate insurance 
cover (Recommendation X-8.III).

Lastly, your Company should address the National Ant-
arctic Directorate, agency responsible for national activities 
in the Argentine Antarctic Sector, with a view to making the 
necessary arrangements for the proposed cruises."
EXTRACT FROM THE LETTER DATED 18th AUGUST 1987 FROM "CRUZADAS ARGENTINAS S.R.L."


"Thank you for the information contained in your letter concerning the obligations incumbent upon the Argentine Republic as Party to the Antarctic Treaty, in particular those arising from the Recommendations of the subsequent Consultative Meetings, related to tourism, historic monuments, Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

Cruzadas Argentinas, private tourism company -register No 4489- is the operator responsible for these cruises. They have been organised with the advise and intervention of Antarctic experts, who will also participate in each of the trips for the purpose of adequately briefing the passengers on the measures applicable in the Antarctic Treaty area by virtue of the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and other provisions, and guiding them during landings.

In line with such careful planification, it is our intention to fully satisfy any requirements that your Directorate might formulate. In this connection, I wish to inform that our Company has already held a meeting with officers of the National Antarctic Directorate, on July 21st, in which opportunity our project was made known, and that it will continue in contact with that agency. We are also in permanent contact with the Tourism Secretariat, pioneer agency in Antarctic tourism, which is assisting us with its expertise. A copy of this letter will also be sent to said agencies.

I enclose the requested information. It was prepared following Recommendation VIII-9 (Annex C). However, I will shortly send you two booklets, currently in press, containing additional details, as well as the information on adequate insurance, currently under discussion between Cruzadas Argentinas and the ship owner".
