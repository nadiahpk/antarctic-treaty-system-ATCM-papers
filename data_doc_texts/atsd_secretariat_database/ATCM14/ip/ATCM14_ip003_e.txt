Recommendation

Rec. 2 (EC/WGAM-IV) - OBSERVATIONS FROM SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN 
THE ANTARCTIC

THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL WORKING GROUP ON ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY;

NOTING:

    (1) That supply ships operating in the Antarctic have adequate 
communication facilities and may carry meteorological staff,

    (2) That aircraft are extensively used for the supply of bases in 
the Antarctic,

CONSIDERING:

    (1) That supply ships do not at present always make and transmit 
meteorological observations,

    (2) That most supply ships are also suitable for the carrying out of 
upper-air programmes,

    (3) That aircraft reports are of particular importance in the area 
south of 60°S to supplement data from radiosonde/radiowind stations,

URGES Members to ensure that:

    (1) All supply vessels operating in the Antarctic make regular 
surface synoptic observations at main synoptic hours, and transmit these data 
to appropriate radio or coastal ground stations in accordance with the 
procedures presented in the Manual on the GTS, Volume I, Part I, 
Attachment I-1 and WMO Publication No. 9. TP:4, Volume D;

    (2) Supply vessels, whenever practicable, also make upper-air 
observations and transmit these reports on a real-time basis;

    (3) Aircraft operating south of 60°S make observations as a matter 
of routine and transmit them to the appropriate radio stations or satellites

        paragraph 8.11,

(2)     Manual on Codes, Volume II,

CONSIDERING:

(1)     That the international exchange of data at 925 hPa from
        Antarctic stations would be very useful for forecasting meteorological
        conditions in the atmospheric boundary layer;

(2)     That the Commission for Basic Systems has invited those regional
        associations which have not already done so to develop regional coding
        procedures for reporting low-level data;

(3)     That the MSL pressure may be as low as 930 hPa in any winter and
        that the 900m level will still be required;

RECOMMENDS:

(1)     That the Council adopts as regional coding procedure the form of
        Part B, Section 9 of code forms FM 35-V TEMP, FM 36-V TEMP SHIP and FM 37-VII
        TEMP DROP which is given in the annex to this recommendation, as from 1
        November 1987;

(2)     That the 900m level should continue to be reported in addition
        to the 925 hPa level;

CONSIDERING:

      (1)  That a globally standardized procedure for pressure reduction
           is not yet established,

      (2)  That particularly for stations at higher elevations (i.e. 500m
           or higher) application of different pressure reduction procedures in some
           cases result in sea level pressure values which are not comparable,

      (3)  That in such cases the additional reporting of station level
           pressure values is essential to correct for deformations in the analysis of
           the horizontal pressure field which are purely artificial and recurring,

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMME FOR THE ANTARCTIC            

IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES 1988-1997                      

Introduction                                               

277.  Although its formal Regional structure was not extended south of 
latitude 60°S, WMO recognizes that the basic synoptic network in the Antarctic 
is an important component of the Global Observing System (GOS).  The operation 
and maintenance of this network, the implementation of the surface and       
upper-air observing programmes and the timely transmission of the           
observational data by means of the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) are
essential components of the WWW system in order to meet Members' requirements
for meteorological data for both global analysis and prediction and for data 
and specialized products within the Antarctic itself.  The preparation and    
distribution of meteorological analyses and prognoses for the Antarctic and 
specialized forecasts for users, as well as warnings of dangerous weather     
conditions for the Antarctic are important components of the Global         
Data-Processing System (GDPS).                                        

Overall objectives of WMO in the Antarctic                

278.  The objectives are:                                          

(a) Implementation of surface- and upper-air observations, consistent with 
the programmes initiated by the parties to the Antarctic Treaty and agreed 
to by the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology;               

(b) Operation, by mutual agreement of parties to the Antarctic Treaty, of  
Antarctic Meteorological Centres, with functions similar to those of a WWW 
Specialized Meteorological Centre.  Such centre(s) which could be located  
either inside or outside the Antarctic would be supported by other centres 
which might also be located inside or outside the Antarctic.  The purpose 
of the Antarctic Meteorological Centre is to meet the requirements of Members 
for specialized analyses, forecasts, and products covering the Antarctic; 

(c) Organization and continuing improvement of the necessary             
telecommunication links, including satellite links, among the Antarctic    
stations, and between the Antarctic and the GTS;                   

(d) Definition by the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology of the    
requirements for meteorological services in the various areas of the      
Antarctic continent and surrounding Southern Ocean, both by the parties to 
the Antarctic Treaty and of other interested countries;            

(e) Organization of the exchange of agreed meteorological information   
between the Antarctic stations and the Antarctic Meteorological Centre(s), 
as well as of agreed information between the Antarctic and interested WMCs 
and other centres;                                                 

(f) Use in the Antarctic of modern techniques and systems for observations 
and data collection, processing and dissemination.

ANNEX I p. 2

Specific implementation objectives to be achieved by 1997 in the Antarctic

279.  The specific implementation objectives are listed for each WWW element 
in the following paragraphs.

GDPS

280.  One or more Antarctic Meteorological Centre(s) will be designated by 
agreement with parties to the Antarctic Treaty.  (Such Centre(s) may be inside 
or outside the Antarctic).  With support from WMCs and other centres, these 
Centre(s) will provide the following services to users:

     (a)     Preparation of meteorological analyses and prognoses for the whole of 
             the Antarctic or for defined sectors thereof, and making these 
             promptly available to other centres/stations inside or outside the 
             Antarctic;

     (b)     Preparation of specialized meteorological forecasts for users (marine 
             and aviation interests, traverse parties, etc.) and making these 
             promptly available to other centres/stations inside or outside the 
             Antarctic;

     (c)     Preparation and distribution of warnings of dangerous weather 
             conditions for the area for which the centre prepares analyses, 
             prognoses or specialized forecasts;

     Note:  The provision of these services may be subject to seasonal 
     variation between the southern summer and winter.

281.  Data and product sets will be prepared in non-real-time at WMC and 
other Centres, or at Antarctic Meteorological Centre(s) and appropriately 
formatted and quality controlled, for use in various application and research 
programmes (e.g. climate diagnosis, synoptic/climatological analyses, etc.).

GOS

282.  The space-based network will be implemented by the satellite operators 
in accordance with the WWW Plan.  Certain observing systems (e.g. ASDAR, ASAP 
and drifting buoys) will be implemented on a global basis, e.g. through groups 
of interested Members.  Data from these observing systems and data and imagery 
from the space-based systems will be available to Centres and stations inside 
and outside the Antarctic for use in their analysis, forecasting and storm 
warning services.

283.  Implementation of Basic Synoptic Networks in the Antarctic will be 
sought according to the programmes initiated by the parties to the Antarctic 
Treaty and reviewed by the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology.  These 
include a surface-based network with observations taken at the four main 
standard times of observation and where possible, at some or all of the four 
intermediate standard times of observation, and twice per day (00 and 12 GMT) 
at radiosonde stations. The Basic Synoptic Networks will also provide the

ANNEX I p. 3

Antarctic contribution to the global surface synoptic land station network 
reporting at least at the four main synoptic hours with ideally a horizontal 
spacing of 300 to 500 km and radiosonde stations reporting twice per day with 
a spacing of 500 to 1000 km.

284.     Members concerned will also:

         (a)     Arrange for additional surface synoptic and upper-air observations 
                 from suitable ships;

         (b)     Operate radars for special purposes.

         GTS

285.     Observational data and products will be exchanged in a regular and 
timely fashion within the Antarctic through special data exchange arrangements 
between centres and stations:  at least 80% of the Antarctic data will be 
available at centres and stations in the Antarctic within three hours. 
Processed products will reach stations within six hours.

286.     Global and regional observational data and products from outside the 
Antarctic will be exchanged in a regular and timely fashion, through special 
transmission arrangements.

287.     There will be regular and timely transmission of Antarctic data to 
other Regions and WMCs (as defined in paragraph 18, Part A).

IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES

Main activities for achieving WWW objectives in the Antarctic

288.     The following activities to improve the WWW in the Antaractic are 
expected to have been implemented when the Plan begins:

         (a)     The Secretary-General of WMO will have informed the parties to the 
                 Antarctic Treaty of the importance which WMO attaches to high quality 
and readily available meteorological observations in the Antarctic and 
will have requested them to communicate their plans with respect of 
the objectives of WWW as outlined in para. 278;

         (b)     The EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology will have been asked to

(d)     The parties to the Antarctic Treaty will have been requested to 
        organize a meeting of experts on telecommunications (including a 
        representative of the Secretary-General of WMO) to develop an improved 
        scheme of telecommunication links within the Antarctic region and 
        between Antarctica and other countries for the purposes of meeting the 
        requirements of interested countries for the collection, exchange and 
        dissemination of meteorological information;

(e)     The parties to the Antarctic Treaty will be asked if they have any 
        plans to establish a centre in support of Antarctic Meteorology;

289.    The following activities to improve the WWW in the Antarctic will be 
        implemented in the early years of this Second Long-term Plan:

(a)     The EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology will be requested to 
        formulate the requirements for meteorological services in the various 
        areas of the Antarctic continent and surrounding southern Oceans;

                                1988

(b)     Members concerned will be requested to begin the implementation of the 
        improved Basic Synoptic Network in the Antarctic as agreed upon by the 
        EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology;

                                1988

(c)     Members concerned will be requested to begin the implementation of the 
        improved telecommunication links, including satellite links, among the 
        Antarctic centres/stations and between the Antarctic and the remainder 
        of the GTS;

                                1988

(d)     The EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology will recommend to 
        parties to the Antarctic Treaty a list of proposed Antarctic 
        Meteorological Centres whose designation would be technically and 
        operationally sound;

                                1988

(e)     The parties to the Antarctic Treaty will be asked to agree to the 
        designation of the Antarctic Meteorological Centres;

                                1988

(f)     Members concerned will be requested to begin the implementation of the 
        designated Centres;

                                1989

(g)     The EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology will be requested to 
        determine the requirements for non-real-time data and relevant Members 
        will be requested to develop procedures for generating non-real-time 
        data and products.

GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE WORK OF THE SESSION

1.     ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1)

1.1   Opening of the session (Agenda item 1.1)

1.1.1  The Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology held its 
fourth session in Geneva from 1 to 5 September 1986.  The session was opened 
at 10 a.m. on Monday 1 September 1986 by Dr. N. A. Streten, chairman of the 
working group who extended a warm welcome to all the participants at the 
session.  He wished the working group success in the important tasks assigned 
to it and emphasized the importance of future informal contacts among its 
members.

1.1.2  On behalf of the Secretary-General, Mr. D. K. Smith, Deputy 
Secretary-General welcomed all participants to the WMO Secretariat in 
Geneva.  He paid tribute to Mr. G. J. Day (U.K.) for his excellent work in 
the past as the chairman of the working group and congratulated Dr. N. A. 
Streten (Australia) on his nomination as chairman of the working group.

1.1.3  Mr. Smith pointed out that a number of important matters needed to be 
considered by this session, among them, the review of the observing programme 
the collection and distribution of observational data and specialized products 
within the Antarctic, the exchange of information with centres outside the 
Antarctic, matters relating to codes and methods of observation in the 
Antarctic, and Antarctic aspects of the WCP.

1.1.4  Mr. Smith drew the attention of the working group to the 
meteorological data coverage in the Antarctic which had remained at about the 
same level for some time but had dropped slightly in recent years.  He 
expressed the hope that the future trend would be towards more data on a wider 
range of atmospheric, cryospheric and oceanic variables.  Finally, he wished 
the meeting every success and hoped the participants would have an enjoyable 
stay in Geneva.

1.1.5  There were 20 participants from twelve Members at the session 
including observers from Italy and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic 
Research (SCAR).  A list of participants is given at the beginning of this 
report.

1.2   Adoption of the agenda (Agenda item 1.2)

The working group approved the provisional agenda as proposed without 
any change.  The agenda is reproduced at the beginning of this report.

1.3   Working arrangements for the session (Agenda item 1.3)

The session agreed on its working hours and decided that the work 
should generally be carried out in plenary sessions.  However, small groups 
could be set up to deal with particular items if necessary.

2.      REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE WORKING GROUP (Agenda item 2)

2.1     The session noted with appreciation the report of Dr. N. A. Streten 
on the activities of the working group since its third session in 1982, with 
particular reference to the period 1984-1986 which represented his term of 
office.

2.2     In his introduction, Dr. Streten mentioned that the session should 
consider if there is a need for more frequent sessions of this working 
group.  The session agreed with his proposal to request the Executive Council 
to consider this matter and to make appropriate arrangements for this.

2.3     The session agreed that the various items discussed would be 
considered under the appropriate agenda items.  The session also agreed that 
the future work programme of the working group would be considered in 
co-operation with the WWW Plan and Implementation Programme for the Period 
1988-1997.

2.4     The session reviewed the terms of reference assigned to the working 
group.  Some amendments were proposed.  Recommendation 1 (EC/WGAM-IV) was 
adopted.

3.      REVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE THIRD SESSION OF THE WORKING GROUP 
AND RELEVANT DECISIONS OF CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL 
(Agenda item 3)

3.1     The session reviewed the action taken by EC-XXXIV in adopting five 
resolutions based on corresponding recommendations of the third session of the 
working group.  The session agreed that actions on Resolution 4 (EC-XXXIV) - 
Manual on the Global Observing System, Volume II - Regional Aspects, Antarctic 
and Resolution 8 (EC-XXXIV) - Manual on the Global Data-processing System, 
Volume II - Regional Aspects, Antarctic, had been completed and that these 
resolutions need no longer be kept in force.

3.2     Resolution 5 (EC-XXXIV) - Basic Synoptic Network in the Antarctic and 
Resolution 6 (EC-XXXIV) - Network of CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP Reporting Stations 
in the Antarctic, were reviewed under Agenda item 4.3.

3.3     The session reviewed Resolution 7 (EC-XXXIV) - Collection and 
Transmission of Meteorological Data in the Antarctic and Adjacent Areas, and 
agreed that this matter would be considered under Agenda item 4.4.

3.4     In reviewing Resolution 7 (EC-XXXV) - Executive Council Working Group 
on Antarctic Meteorology, the session agreed that this matter would be 
considered under Agenda item 2.

3.5     The session had a lengthy discussion on Resolution 22 (EC-XXI) - 
Observation from ships and aircraft operating in the Antarctic.  The session 
agreed that the basic principle of this resolution was still valid and 
confirmed the continuing need for observations from ships and aircraft in the 
Antarctic.  After making some amendments, Recommendation 2 (EC/WGAM-IV) - 
Observations from ships and aircraft operating in the Antarctic was adopted.

4.      WWW ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE ANTARCTIC, INCLUDING THE WWW PLAN AND
        WWW IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMME FOR THE PERIOD 1988-1997 (Agenda item 4)

4.1     Draft WWW Plan and WWW Implementation Programme for the period
        1988-1997 as part of the Second Long-term Plan (Agenda item 4.1)

        The working group considered the WWW Implementation Programme and
        introduced a number of changes following the proposals of EC-XXXVII.  The
        working group reformulated the objectives relating to the GDPS aspects.  In
        this connection the need for improvements of the analyses and forecasting for
        the Antarctic was recognized.  This effort used to be supported through
        co-operative efforts by Members through the operation of Antarctic
        Meteorological Centres, which may have functions similar to the Specialized
        Meteorological Centres, defined in the WWW Plan for the period 1988-1997.  It
        was particularly stressed that Antarctic Meteorological Centres could be
        located inside or outside the Antarctic and may be supported by other centres
        which could also be inside or outside the Antarctic.  In this connection it
        was stressed that the purpose of an Antarctic Centre is to meet requirements
        of Members for specialized analyses or forecasts and products covering the
        Antarctic.  The revised text of the WWW Implementation Programme for the
        period 1988-1997 is given in the annex to this paragraph.

4.2     Data-processing system including codes (Agenda item 4.2)

        Requirements for observational data and processed information and
        meteorological service activities in the Antarctic

4.2.1   The session noted that a survey on the requirement for observational
        data and processed information in the Antarctic was conducted by the
        Secretariat in June/July 1986.  The results of the survey were consolidated
        into two tables.  The session agreed that these tables should be considered
        in conjunction with the arrangements for the exchange and transmission of
        Antarctic data under Agenda item 4.4.  However, in view of the fact that not
        all Members concerned had responded to the survey, the session agreed that
        Members carrying out data-processing activities should be further requested to
        send the relevant information to the WMO Secretariat (see paragraph 4.4.18).

4.2.2   The session noted that one chapter concerning the data-processing and
        meteorological service activities in the Antarctic as approved Resolution 8
        (EC-XXXIV) was included in Volume II of the Manual on the GDPS, Regional
        Aspect, Volume II of the Manual on the Global Data-processing System, Regional
        Aspects, the Antarctic. The session considered that this chapter should be
        used as guidance material in relation to the data-processing and
        meteorological service activities in the Antarctic.

WWW/2493
Antarctic regional code matters

4.2.3  The session noted that the eighth session of the Commission for Basic 
Systems (Geneva, January/February 1983) considered the inclusion of low-level 
data (925 hPa or 900m when 925 hPa is below ground level) in codes FM 35-V 
TEMP and FM 36-V TEMP SHIP and recorded its decision in paragraph 8.11 which 
reads as follows:

"The Commission considered a proposal by the eighth session of 
Regional Association VI to report low-level data in Part A of TEMP and 
TEMP SHIP: either as a mandatory surface of 925 hPa or as a fixed 
height level e.g. 900m, when meteorological conditions are such that 
the 925 hPa is below ground-level.  The Commission noted that three 
regional associations, namely RAs I, II and VI had already adopted 
regional coding procedures for reporting 925 hPa in Part B of TEMP and 
TEMP SHIP.  The Commission therefore invited the other regional 
associations to consider the question of reporting low-level data 
under regional procedures before the appropriate global regulations 
could be considered."

4.2.4  In view of the fact that this level can be of considerable interest 
for specification of the boundary layer and that other regions had developed 
such procedures, Recommendation 3 (EC/WGAM-IV) - Regional coding procedures 
for reporting data for the 925 hPa level was adopted.

4.2.5  The session noted that the Commission for Basic Systems Extraordinary 
Session (1985) (Hamburg, October/November 1985) considered matters concerning 
the standardization of pressure reduction procedures and recommended that 
SYNOP reports may contain both pressure at station level and mean sea level 
pressure, at least for stations above a given altitude.  This had 
subsequently been agreed to by some regional associations.  The Commission 
also considered that 500m might be an appropriate altitude and urged regional 
associations to take the necessary action to adopt this altitude.

4.2.6  The session considered the above conclusions of the CBS Ext. (85), and 
Recommendation 4 (EC/WGAM-IV) - Regional coding procedures for reporting 
station pressure was adopted.

4.2.7  The session had a lengthy discussion on the expressed additional 
requirements for global and regional exchange of observational data such as 
snow-depth, precipitation, sunshine, evaporation (evapotranspiration) and 
net-radiation data.  It felt that difficulties exist in making observations 
of such items in the Antarctic, and these should be considered by CIMO as well 
as other matters of instruments and methods of observation peculiar to the 
Antarctic under Agenda item 5.

4.2.8  Recommendation 5 (EC/WGAM-IV) - Regional coding procedures to meet 
additional data requirement was adopted.

WMO/2493
4.3     OBSERVING SYSTEM (Agenda item 4.3)

General

4.3.1   The session noted that the Global Observing System (GOS), as outlined
in the World Weather Watch Plan for 1984-1987, comprised:

        (a)     The surface-based sub-system, the main elements of which
comprised the regional basic synoptic networks of surface and
upper-air stations on land and at sea, aircraft meteorological
observations and other elements including climatological
stations, agricultural meteorological stations and special
stations; and

        (b)     The space-based sub-system, consisting of the
near-polar-orbiting satellites, the geostationary meteorological
satellites and the associated ground segment for the reception
and processing of data.

4.3.2   The session recognized that while an increasing amount of quantitative
satellite data had become available and further increases could be expected,
the surface-based sub-system would continue to constitute the basic source of
data needed to meet global, regional and national requirements.  Members
should, therefore, be urged to maintain the present observing networks and to
spare no effort in expanding and optimizing the networks and facilities.
Efforts should also continue to be made to improve the regularity and quality
of observations to meet the standards set forth in the WMO Technical
Regulations, including the Manual on the Global Observing System.

Surface-based sub-system

4.3.3   In reviewing the surface-based sub-system the session was pleased to
note that the three new surface stations established by China, India and
Uruguay were already, or would soon become, fully operational.  It was hoped
that the observational data from these stations would soon be available for
global exchange.  It was agreed that the three stations should be included in
the basic synoptic network for the Antarctic.  The session noted with
appreciation that other Members, including Japan and U.S.S.R. planned to
establish new stations and expand the observing programmes at existing
stations.

4.3.4   The session noted that the level of implementation of the basic
synoptic network, which stood at 82% for surface stations (91% at the main
standard times) and 60% for upper-air stations, had changed little in the past
few years.  It was gratified to learn however that there had been a marked
increase in the number of ship reports from the Antarctic region transmitted
on the GTS.

4.3.5   In the light of further information provided by Members on the status
of implementation of stations in the basic synoptic network, and noting the
minor changes in the network which had been approved by the President of WMO
since its last session, the working group drew up a revised list of stations
comprising the basic network and adopted Recommendation 6 (EC/WGAM-IV).  In so
doing the working group stressed particularly the need for additional
upper-air stations in certain parts of the region.

4.3.6   Special importance was attached by the working group to the use of 
automatic weather stations in the Antarctic. Having been informed of the 
current and planned activities of a number of countries for the establishment 
of automatic land stations and the deployment of buoys and fixed platforms in 
the region, the session urged its Members to try to ensure that data from such 
stations, particularly land stations and even those established temporarily 
for research purposes, were made generally available.

4.3.7   In this connection, the session noted that in addition to the 
deployment of automatic stations, considerable work had been done to develop 
new components of the GOS some of which would be implemented in the near 
future and which would contribute significantly to an improved and enhanced 
observing system. These included the Automated Shipboard Aerological 
Programme (ASAP), the Aircraft to Satellite Data Relay (ASDAR) and 
improvements in satellite sensors. Recognizing that many Members participate 
in these activities in the context of their participation in other WMO 
programmes, the session adopted Recommendation 7 (EC/WGAM-IV) urging Members 
individually and collectively to participate in the deployment and use of new 
observing systems in the Antarctic.

4.3.8   As regards CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP reporting stations, the session 
reiterated the view expressed at its third session that every synoptic station 
in the Antarctic should if possible issue such reports. The group was pleased 
to note that the number of CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP reporting stations had in 
fact increased by three since its last session. The session adopted 
Recommendation 8 (EC/WGAM-IV) with a revised network of stations.

4.3.9   The session noted that while the space-based sub-system comprised 
near-polar-orbiting satellites and geostationary satellites only the former 
had the capability to meet the requirements over the polar regions. The 
polar-orbiting satellites (800-1000 km near polar orbit) comprised the NOAA 
series TIROS-N (U.S.A.) and the METEOR-2 system (U.S.S.R.).

4.3.10   It was further noted that the third generation of the U.S.A. 
near-polar-orbiting operational satellite system, continues to provide data 
for operational and research purposes. The sensing equipment of these 
satellites were the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and the Advanced 
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). As regards the METEOR-2 system the 
Group was informed that the satellites are equipped with camera systems and 
scanning radiometers to provide visual and infra-red images of cloud as well 
as snow and ice cover. The METEOR-2 satellite also provides cloud-top 
temperatures and height, temperatures and values of outgoing long-wave 
radiation and reflected solar radiation. These data are processed and 
distributed over the GTS in pictorial and other forms.

4.3.11   Data from satellites are made available to Members by means of 
satellite receiving equipment through the Direct Sounding Transmission (DST), 
Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) and High Resolution Picture Transmission 
(HRPT) services. In addition, the TIROS-type satellites have a Data 
Collection System (DCS) to receive data from fixed and moving platforms and to 
process and store the data for later transmission to a central processing 
(ARGOS) facility. The Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT) has the facility 
to collect data from fixed platforms and later transmit it to Meteorological 
Data Utilization Centre (MDUC), New Delhi.

4.4   TELECOMIUNICATION SYSTEM (Agenda item 4.4)

4.4.1   The session noted that the meeting on Antarctic Telecommunication 
Arrangements (Geneve; June 1983) reviewed the existing situation concerning 
international exchange of meteorological data and processed information inside 
and outside the Antarctic.  It also noted with satisfaction that the meeting 
developed two diagrams, namely:

      (a)   Existing links for the daily international exchange of meteorological 
            data within the Antarctic (June 1983);

      (b)   Principal routes by which Antarctic meteorological data enters the GTS.

4.4.2   The session further noted that the above-mentioned two diagrams have 
been included in the seventh section of Volume II of the Manual on the GTS 
entitled "Antarctic" with a note "The Antarctic is not a WMO Region and the 
information contained in this section is included in the Manual purely for 
convenience in accordance with the decision of the thirty-sixth session of the 
Executive Council."  The session noted with satisfaction that the inclusion of 
this section into the Manual, in particular the two diagrams mentioned above, 
was very important to determine the actual situation of the Antarctic 
telecommunication arrangements for exchange of Antarctic meteorological 
information.

4.4.3   During the session a telecommunication sub-group was established 
comprising:

            Mr. P. Limbert (U.K.)
            Mr. P. Le Roux (SCAR)
            Mr. S. Cornford (U.K.) acted as Rapporteur.

The terms of reference of this sub-group were as follows:

      (a)   To examine the recommendations of the Meeting on Antarctic 
            Telecommunications Arrangements (Geneva, June 1983) and to see how far 
            these have been implemented by individual Members concerned;

      (b)   To indicate where problems still lie;

      (c)   To consider Figures 1 and 2 of the Manual on the GTS, Volume II, 
            Section Seven and recommend any necessary modifications;

      (d)   To consider the requirements for the Antarctic meteorological data and 
            processed information and recommend any necessary modifications;

      (e)   To report findings under (a) to (d) above to the session.

The sub-group was given information by the representatives of:

            Argentina
            Australia
            India
            U.K.
            U.S.A.
            U.S.S.R.

4.4.4  The session noted with appreciation the work done by the sub-group.
The conclusions and recommendations adopted by this sub-group were examined by
the session. The session decided on necessary action as recorded in the
following paragraphs in order to improve the Antarctic Telecommunication
arrangements.

4.4.5  Implementation of recommendations of June 1983 Telecommunication
Meeting

In general, these recommendations have been adopted by individual
Members and are thought to be followed carefully. However, it was clear that
practices in the WMCs/RTHs vary; some use abbreviated headings and some use
block and station numbers as identifiers. This gives rise to at least two
problems:

(a)    One problem is that when observations reach WMC/RTH hubs via routes
which users do not expect, they may appear in bulletins with
abbreviated headings for centres remote from the Antarctic. Users
need to be aware of this possibility. A routing may be "unexpected"
because of a change in practice which has not been notified throughout
the GTS, down to local level, or has not been implemented throughout
the telecommunication system. Alternatively, it may be because ad-hoc
or planned reserve arrangements have been used because of a failure
somewhere in a primary system. With the increase in the number of
observations being put into the GTS via satellite links, especially
automatic weather-stations, buoys and ships, the number of Antarctic
observations entering the GTS via the GTS centres outside the
Antarctic is expected to increase;

(b)    The other problem is that the centres concerned may not look for
observations under, say, block 88 when they are expected under block
89.

4.4.6  The session noted that Section E of Volume I of the Manual on Codes
specifies that Antarctic stations which held numbers in 1957 before the
introduction of the use of the block number 89 retain their previously
allocated index numbers. The session recommended that an amendment to the
Manual on Codes should be made to ensure that all fixed stations south of 60°S
use block number 89.

4.4.7  The session recommended that the GTS centres receiving Antarctic
meteorological data from primary sources should compile them into Antarctic
bulletins and give them an agreed and promulgated abbreviated heading which
clearly identifies them as containing Antarctic data. The session recognized
that this may be more difficult at the more highly automated centres and so
should be done as early as possible in the process of putting the data into
the GTS. Users will need to scan the promulgated list of bulletin headings to
identify those they require and then inform their upstream telecommunication
centre.

4.4.8  The session recognized that the seasonal variability of requirements
and availability of data may give rise to scheduling problems for products and
bulletins of Antarctic data originated or handled at centres remote from the
Antarctic. The session recommended that such centres be alerted to the
possible problem.

4.4.9 The session noted that the catalogue of meteorological bulletins for 
the Antarctic is incomplete at present and in some places is inaccurate.  The 
session requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary action with the 
Members concerned to update and complete the Antarctic meteorological 
bulletins in the Catalogue of Meteorological Bulletins.  A summary of the 
information of the collection of observational data by individual centres is 
given in Annex II to this report.

4.4.10 The session noted that in accordance with Recommendation 2(e) of the 
June 1983 telecommunication meeting, Members should inject into the GTS only 
data from those stations for which they had a prime responsibility.  The 
session considered that, because of present deficiencies in the system, a 
certain amount of redundancy might be acceptable, so as to increase the 
probability of observations getting through in an accurate and timely way. 
Some redundancy should be provided for in areas where monitoring shows that 
there are most problems.  The session bore this in mind when formulating its 
proposals for the Tables of Requirement of raw and processed data and in the 
diagrams showing links within the Antarctic and the routes by which Antarctic 
data enter the GTS north of 60°S.

4.4.11 The session noted that Recommendation 2(h) called for real-time 
monitoring.  Whilst one representative hoped that this might improve following 
increased automation of his telecommunication centre, the representative of 
Australia reported that, despite automation, real-time monitoring at 
WMC Melbourne seemed unlikely to become possible in the foreseeable future. 
Monitoring on a real-time basis seems to be the most effective means available 
at present.  Both computer and man have a role in this.  The fact that quality 
control procedures sometimes result in observations not passing through some 
centres provides another argument for having a certain amount of redundancy 
when traffic levels on telecommunication hubs allow it.

4.4.12 The session considered that Members are now sufficiently aware of the 
use of telecommunication capabilities of meteorological satellites and 
satellite communication systems (e.g. INMARSAT, INTELSAT, etc) and that they 
are being implemented.  This is reflected in present and planned practice as 
shown in the diagrams of internal links and GTS entry.

4.4.13 The session noted that, so far, the use of satellite communications 
has not increased, and may, indeed, have decreased the availability of 
Antarctic data internally within the Antarctic.  There is no inherent reason 
for this.  Satellite links can work both ways.  The session recommended that 
at least three centres outside the Antarctic be designated as Antarctic 
Meteorological Centres and be given, as one of their tasks, the transmission 
via satellite of bulletins of Antarctic data to receiving stations inside the 
Antarctic.

4.4.14 The session felt that for dissemination of the Antarctic 
meteorological observational data bulletins within the Antarctic, radio 
teleprinter broadcasts should continue to be required.  The obvious centres to 
originate these are:

    Molodezhnaya
    Marambia and/or Frei
    Mc Murdo and/or Casey

Mc Murdo or Casey might be supported by WMC/RTH Melbourne and/or RMC/RTH 
Wellington.

4.4.15 The session noted that the following six centres would provide 
products for use within the Antarctic:

              Melbourne             Moscow
              Washington            Bracknell
              Buenos Aires          Pretoria.

4.4.16 The session was encouraged by reports that INMARSAT links had been 
established between Moscow and Molodeyhnaya and between New Delhi and Dakshin 
Gangtori. A further link by INMARSAT will be with Novolazarevskaya. INTELSAT 
link between Melbourne and Davis are planned for 1986/1987 and between 
Melbourne, Mawson and Casey for 1987/1988. Argentina has also established a 
link between Marambio and Buenos Aires using INMARSAT.

4.4.17 The session updated the above-mentioned diagrams, taking into account 
the recent development of the Antarctic telecommunication arrangements, in 
particular the use of satellite communications.  In so doing the session took 
into account that:

(a)      The numbers associated with the links between the Antarctic and the 
GTS north of 60°S refer to the number of stations in the source 
bulletin;

(b)      Two way links crossing 60°S may be either satellite or HF radio.  To 
ensure durability of Figure 2, no indication of the kind of link is 
given;

(c)      Alternative routeings for use as back up are not indicated.  They are 
a matter of bilateral arrangement.

The up-dated diagrams are given in Annex III to this report.  The session 
requested the Secretary-General, after the approval of the Executive Council, 
to amend the Manual on the GTS, Volume II, Section Seven.

4.4.18 The session further reviewed the requirements for observational data 
and processed information within and outside the Antarctic.  The session 
updated these requirements as far as possible.  The updated requirements are 
given in Annex IV to this report.  However, further updating might be 
necessary since representatives of some Members were unable to attend this 
session. Therefore, the session requested the Secretary-General to make an 
inquiry amongst the Members concerned to update their requirements in this 
respect (see paragraph 4.2.1).

4.4.19 The session discussed at great length the action necessary to further 
improve the existing status of the operation of the Antarctic 
telecommunication arrangements.  In this connection, the above-mentioned 
conclusions were brought to the attention of the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting (Canberra, September 1983).  This meeting noted the 
efforts of the WMO to improve the exchange of the Antarctic meteorological 
data and recommended the Governments concerned to invite WMO to keep under 
review the arrangements for routeing of meteorological data within the 
Antarctic and between the Antarctic and the rest of the GTS of the WWW.

4.5     Data management (Agenda item 4.5)

4.5.1   Under this agenda item, the session discussed mainly the results of 
the annual global monitoring carried out in October 1984 and 1985 with a view 
to improving the operation of the GTS as regards the exchange of the Antarctic 
meteorological data.  The monitoring results were composed of:

        (a)     Availability of the Antarctic meteorological reports (SYNOP and TEMP) 
                based on the results of the monitoring carried out in 1981, 1982, 
                1983, 1984 and 1985;

        (b)     The number of SYNOP reports received at various MTN centres from 
                individual stations in Antarctic - 1-15 October 1984;

        (c)     The same as above but for 1-15 October 1985;

        (d)     Timeliness of reception at one centre of SYNOP reports from individual 
                stations (1-15 October 1984 and 1985);

        (e)     The number of TEMP reports received at various MTN centres from 
                individual stations in Antarctic (1-15 October 1984 and 1985);

        (f)     Timeliness of reception at one MTN centre of TEMP reports from 
                individual stations in Antarctic (1-15 October 1985).

4.5.2   The session noted that:

        (a)     Observation reports from Chilean stations are available at Washington 
                but hardly anywhere else;

        (b)     The Amundsen-Scott station at the South Pole was available only once a 
                day at all centres;

        (c)     The U.K. bulletins originating from the DCP at Faraday were only 
                partly received at Washington and hardly at all anywhere else.  In 
                1985 this was subsequently found to have been caused by disconnection 
                of the DCP antenna.  However, this does not explain the deficiencies 
                in 1984, which may still continue.  If so they require investigation 
                and remedial action.

4.5.3   The session concluded that the monitoring results indicated some 
deficiencies in the operation of the telecommunication system for the exchange 
of the Antarctic meteorological data.  The session endorsed the conclusions of 
the Meeting of experts on Antarctic data Telecommunication Arrangements 
(June 1983) concerning possible lost or missing reports.  These reasons were 
as follows:

        (a)     Some centres indicated that a certain number of reports received were 
                not usable; these data might be recorded as "not received" by 
                downstream centres in some cases;

        (b)     Bulletins incorrectly formatted might not be relayed from one centre 
                to another;

        (c)     Some centres might not recognize some bulletins or reports due to 
                their excessive delay in reception;

WWW/2493
- 12 -

(d) Ommission of report-separation signal (=) might cause difficulty to 
    separate individual reports in sequence;

(e) Some bulletins contained diferent types of observational reports or 
    reports made at different observation times.

4.5.4 The session agreed that the GTS centres concerned should consider 
these problems with a view to improving the GTS operation.  The session 
requested the Secretary-General to draw the attention of the Members concerned 
on these points and take appropriate remedial action.  In this connection, the 
session felt that specific monitoring for the exchange of Antarctic 
meteorological data should be carried out in two weeks of December, in order 
to evaluate the overall efficiency of the operation in this respect.  The 
session requested the Secretary-General to make the necessary arrangemenets 
with the Members concerned to carry out this specific monitoring in the first 
and second weeks in December, every year.

4.5.5 The session noted that ships' weather reports and ocean buoy data from 
55°S to 65°S are very useful to make analyses and prognoses for the 
Antarctic.  However, not all data were available at the centres in the 
Antarctic.  The session urged the Members concerned to initiate the necessary 
measures to transmit those data to the centres in the Antarctic.

5.    INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS OF OBSERVATION PECULIAR TO THE ANTARCTIC 
      (Agenda item 5)

5.1   The working group reviewed the replies of members to the circular 
letter on specific problems and experience on instruments and methods of 
observation peculiar to the Antarctic.  It concluded that the collection of 
the replies from ten members of the working group is not only a list of 
problems but the material represents the collective wisdom of Members 
operating Antarctic stations over many years and in many cases provides 
solutions for some existing difficulties.  It is, therefore, a very valuable 
document which, in the present form, is helpful for all Members operating 
Antarctic stations.

5.2   The working group noted, with appreciation, the activities of CIMO in 
particular instrument comparisons (WMO Radiosonde Intercomparison and Solid 
Precipitation Measurement Comparison) which are also related to Antarctic 
meteorological measurement problems.

5.3   The working group suggested that the material resulting from the 
survey should be submitted to CIMO in an appropriate way for its 
consideration.  In particular CIMO should be requested:

(a) To provide guidelines for standardized instrument operations and 
    methods of observations in the Antarctic;

(b) To provide guidance on the operation of automatic weather stations;

(c) To arrange comparisons of instruments operated in the Antarctic;

(d) To organize an exchange of experience of instrument experts on 
    Antarctic problems further to that provided by the present survey;

(e) To define the limitations of instrument performances for Antarctic 
    purposes.

6.       ANTARCTIC ASPECTS OF THE WORLD CLIMATE RESEARCH PROGRAMME (WCRP)
         (Agenda item 6)

         Sea ice and climate research

6.1      The session took note of the Cryosphere Research Sub-programme of the
World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).  It also noted the establishment of
the WCRP Working Group on Sea Ice and Climate.  It endorsed the
recommendation of the latter group for conducting an intercomparison of GCM
simulations, with particular attention to surface parameters that force the
sea ice models.

6.2      The session agreed that buoy arrays in the seasonal sea ice zone
around the Antarctic have in the past provided valuable data for both weather
forecasting and climate research.  It further noted that the performance of
global numerical models would be improved by the addition of a limited number
of weather buoys located within the Antarctic sea ice zone.  Furthermore, the
Planning Group of the World Ocean Circulation experiment (WOCE) have
identified the Weddell and Ross Seas as important components of the Southern
Ocean circulation.  The Southern Ocean is presently a component of the TOGA
Programme.  Accordingly, the session adopted Recommendation  9 (EC/WGAM-IV)
- Deployment of data buoys in the Antarctic sea ice zone, for consideration by
the Executive Council during its next session.

Observed ozone decreases in Antarctica

6.3      The session took note of the data published recently which show that
total column ozone during southern spring has decreased by some 40% within the
last 20 years or so in the Antarctic.  The conclusion was the work of the
British Antarctic Survey and has since been confirmed by balloons[?]onde as well
as satellite observations.  The balloon data show that the decrease is mostly
confined to the lower stratospheric altitudes while the satellite data
indicate that the decrease extends over the geogrphical area of the
circumpolar vortex.  The decrease does not appear to persist as the year
progresses.

6.4      The session further noted the research efforts by the German
Democratic Republic, Japan, U.K., U.S.A., and the U.S.S.R. which are
continuing and the programmes being planned by Argentina, India, Italy and
Spain.  These efforts consist of Dobson spectrophotometer and balloons[?]onde
observations, with future plans for concurrent turbidity observations;  the
U.S.A. is planning an extensive campaign in the very near future which would
include co-ordinated observations of radiation and transport parameters,
realted chemical trace species and aerosol composition, in addition to those
mentioned earlier.  The session applauded the efforts of SCAR in promoting
ozone research in the Antarctic.

6.5      The session expressed the view that the discovery of the Antarctic
vernal ozone trend is of major scientific interest.  This was so because the
occasion provides a unique opportunity to answer the question:  "Is this
evidence that human activity is affecting the ozone layer?"  The group felt
that unless the underlying causes are clearly identified and the mechanisms
explained, society is likely to err one way or another in controlling or
failing to control the factors that may contribute to ozone loss.

WWR/2493
- '14 -

6.6     The specific scientific issues, in the view of the session, are:

        (a) The characterization of ozone trends south of 50°S, and
        (b) The understanding of their physical/chemical bases.

Determination of significant trends requires long term measurements (c.a.
10 to 20 years, but even 5 years quality data would be of great help).

6.7     The session felt that current observations, confined mostly to
daylight periods, should extend throughout the polar night.  This suggests a
programme of:

        (a) Moonlight observations with Dobsons and/or other instruments
during the polar night in addition to the regular observations
at other times of the year;

        (b) Weekly balloonsonde ascents throughout the year with emphasis on
polar night observations;

        (c) Examination of other available (satellite) data sets such as
that of HIRS II.  Satellite measurements in the infrared could
provide information on total column ozone during the polar night.

6.8     Based on the above analyses, the session concluded that:

        (a) Using the customary definition of Antarctica as encompassing the
area south of 60°S, three or four well-calibrated Dobson-type
instruments should suffice in Antarctica.  These could be
located at, for example, South Pole, Halley Bay and one or two
other stations south of 70°S.  In addition, to the north up to
50°S latitude, two or three more stations would be desirable,
for example, at McQuarie Island and similar locations.  These
stations would be adding to the existing ground-based data
sets; the session views such addition as critical because of
the limited design lifetimes of current or planned satellite
ozone-related instrumentation;

        (b) All of the stations in (a) above should have balloonsonde
flights with strict quality control.  Concurrent radiosonde
flights are essential;

        (c) It would be desirable to have at least one lidar for accurate
ozone profile data.  The session noted the plans of Italy to
set up a lidar at South Pole and the efforts of the British
Antarctic Survey to have a lidar, perhaps at Halley Bay.

        (d) Concurrent aerosol observations would be of much help.  Ideally
this should include sunphotometer-type turbidity observations as
well as particle size distributions with dustsonde-type
instrumentation.  The session noted that India plans to include
turbidity measurements in its efforts;

        (e) Ancillary observations of related chemical species and of
radiative and transport parameters are essential for a full
understanding of the phenomenon.  Examples of such observations
would be the reactive and reservoir species in the chlorine,
bromine, hydrogen and nitrogen families.  The U.S.A. plans were
noted in this regard.

7.      ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES (Agenda item 7)

7.1     The session noted the progress in Antarctic meteorology research since 
its third session.  A number of Members operating meteorological stations in 
Antarctica were carrying out extensive experimental research programmes.  
Theoretical studies of weather phenomena and general circulation in the 
Antarctic have been undertaken by several meteorological centres.

7.2     The session considered that research into weather analysis and 
prediction contributes to improving forecasting skill both in the Antarctic 
area and on the hemispheric and global scales.  It was stressed that better 
understanding of physical processes in the Antarctic where the data coverage 
is, of necessity, inadequate is especially important.  Synoptic experience may 
be invaluable for improving parameterization schemes to be used in numerical 
models.  In this respect, studies of unique type of boundary layer over the 
continent and of cloud evolution were emphasized.

7.3     The session recommended that it would be appropriate to identify an 
institution (or several institutions) which would volunteer to play a strong 
role in research activity for the expansion of knowledge of Antarctic 
meteorology and the development of new operational products.

7.4     The session further recommended that the WMO Secretariat undertake to 
collect progress reports on Antarctic meteorology research and to arrange, on 
the basis of the information obtained, for the preparation of the summary 
report and, possibly, of a proposal for a study project within the WMO 
Research and Development Programme (as appropriate in co-operation with the 
World Weather Watch Programme).

7.5     The session recognized that it should strengthen its relationship with 
bodies interested in Antarctic meteorology research development, particularly 
with regard to the existing SCAR specialist groups on Climate and Sea Ice.

8.      CO-OPERATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ANTARCTIC PROGRAMMES AND
        ORGANIZATIONS (Agenda item 8)

8.1     The session noted with interest of the activities relating to 
co-operation with other international Antarctic programmes and 
Organizations.     The session agreed that the maintenance of active contacts 
with other groups or bodies such as SCAR, JSC, WMO Technical Commissions, etc. 
with regard to aspects of Antarctic meteorology is one of the important tasks 
of the working group.

8.2     The session noted that the Nineteenth Meeting of SCAR decided to 
disband its Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology and therefore, the session 
agreed that the EC Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology should take more 
responsibility for activities in Antarctic meteorology both in its operational 
and research aspects.

8.3     The session noted and agreed that it is valuable to maintain close 
co-operation, and co-ordination of activities, between WMO and SCAR and for 
there to be mutual representation in the sessions of the two organizations as 
in the past.

8.4     The session agreed to maintain the present arrangement between WMO 
and the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.     However, it agreed that the 
chairman of the working group may provide information on meteorological 
activities in the Antarctic to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.

9.      FUTURE WORK PROGRAMME (Agenda item 9)

9.1     When considering its future work programme, the session again stressed 
the need for more frequent sessions of this working group, preferably two 
sessions during one financial period.     The reasons for this are:

        (a)     The group has responsibilities both to Executive Council and to 
                the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings;

        (b)     The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting holds regular sessions 
                every two years;

        (c)     SCAR also holds regular meetings every two years;

        (d)     The need for updating information and co-ordination of 
                activities more frequently on certain items, such as the 
                observing programmes and the telecommunication arrangements.

9.2     The session agreed that if necessary and if appropriate, the chairman 
of the working group may establish sub-working groups, to operate by 
correspondence, or to designate rapporteurs to carry out special tasks 
assigned to them.

9.3     The session discussed the recommendation made by the Eighteenth 
General Assembly of International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG; 1983) 
to refer to the working group the problem of non-standard and expedition-type 
meteorological and climatological data and agreed that this will be 
incorporated in its future work programme.  In this respect the chairman 
invited members who were able to obtain information regarding historical 
archives of standard or non-standard meteorological data in their own 
countries to make this available to him;  he would then seek to produce a 
suitable catalogue of this information.

10.     CLOSURE OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 10)

        The session was closed on Friday 5 September 1986.
