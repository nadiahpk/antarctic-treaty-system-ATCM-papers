OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM: MATTERS

 ARISING UNDER ARTICLE IX OF THE TREATY


The authority to approve recommendations of an Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting (ATCM) rests with the Secretary of State.  They
are reviewed within the U.S. Government by the Antarctic Policy
Group (APG), which is composed of the Departments of State and
Defense and the National Science Foundation, as well as such
other agencies or offices as may be interested in the particular
recommendation.

In most instances involving agreed recommendations, this APG usually
includes some fourteen agencies. The APG is chaired by the
Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment
and Scientific Affairs with a working group chaired by the Director
of the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs. The review focuses not
only on the substance and merits of the recommendation but also the
relationship of the recommendation to U.S. domestic law and
international agreements, the environmental aspects of the
recommendation and the need for any further evaluation and review
are considered.

If the APG determines that a recommendation  requires implementing
legislation or regulations, the matter is referred to congress or
to the appropriate department or agency for necessary action. The
principal example of U.S. implementing legislation  is the Antarctic
Conservation Act of 1978; the consequent regulations were issued
by the National Science Foundation in 1979, all in implementation of
the agreed measures for the  conservation of Antarctic Fauna and
Flora (Recommendation III-VIII).

In the usual instance, only the review of the APG is required before
a recommendation is approved. The process can be completed within a
matter of months. One aspect of the review is the discrimination
of the responsibilities of U.S. Agencies in implementing the
recommendation  concerned. The Secretary of State or his designated

representative then makes formal notification of U.S. approval 
and the U.S. in its role as depositary notifies the other 
parties of the recommendation's approval. The U.S. has approved 
all the recommendations of the thirteen ATCM's.

The U.S. delegation has prepared this information paper as part 
of an exchange of information in relation to this sub-item of 
this agenda of the fourteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting. Such an exchange, it is hoped, may be of assistance to 
the Consultative Parties in the future consideration of proposed 
agreed recommendation and how they relate to existing measures 
developed within the consultative mechanism as well as to other 
international agreements applicable to activities in Antarctica.
