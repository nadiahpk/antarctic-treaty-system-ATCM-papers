Using ASMAs and ASPAs when necessary to complement CCAMLR MPAs
Summary
The marine environment is facing a myriad of unnecessary, potentially damaging and often cumulative human activities. The Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources C-CAMLR is working towards the establishment of a representative system of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean by 2012. 
Human activities other than use of marine living resources can harm the marine environment and could make all or several of the objectives of a CCAMLR MPA unattainable. CCAMLR MPAs and their objectives should thus be of interest to the Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP) and the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in order to allow for a systematic and comprehensive management and protection regime in the Southern Ocean. Some CCAMLR MPAs, despite the regulative measures already taken by the ATCM and the CEP, may require additional management and protection efforts. Such action would also promote implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and its Annex V with respect of Area Protection and Management. 
It is therefore warranted and important that the ATCM, taking into account the recommendations from C-CAMLR, provides a space for evaluating whether there is a possible need or not to establish an ASMAs or ASPAs, partly or fully, in the area of a CCAMLR MPA. 
1. Marine spatial protection and management – an integral part of the Antarctic Treaty System since the 1960s
The Antarctic Treaty System has different means of spatially managing and protecting the marine environment. Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMAs) under Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection may be used as tools for spatial management and essential recognition of outstanding values in the Southern Ocean. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (C-CAMLR) to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) may establish binding measures regarding the conservation and management of marine living resources including measures permitting the harvesting of particular species.1 C-CAMLR may also designate, in a manner consistent with its management objectives, closed areas for the purposes of scientific study or conservation.2
In accordance with a series of steps as endorsed by its Scientific Committee (SC), C-CAMLR is currently working towards the establishment of a representative system of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean by 2012.3 In 2009 C-CAMLR adopted a Conservation Measure (CM) concerning the ‘Protection of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf’ that designates a marine protected area in which fishing activities are prohibited (subject to exceptions concerning scientific research)4. Following the SC’s advice C-CAMLR also adopted a “General framework for the establishment of CCAMLR Marine Protected Areas”.5 
The general MPA Conservation Measure6 allows C-CAMLR members to provide recommendations on how the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) might use their marine spatial management tools, namely ASMAs and ASAPs, to compliment CCAMLR MPA designations and objectives. 
2. Using the marine spatial protection and management “toolbox”
2.1. Complementing CCAMLR MPAs
MPAs under CCAMLR can be designated for a range of purposes. Conservation Measures declaring and managing MPAs apply to “vessels under the jurisdiction of Parties to the Convention, which are either fishing vessels or vessels conducting scientific research activities on Antarctic marine living resources in accordance with CCAMLR conservation measures”.7
CCAMLR MPA areas of specific interest and concern for the ATCM are those areas designated for:
    • the protection of representative examples of marine ecosystems, biodiversity and habitats at an appropriate scale to maintain their viability and integrity in the long term;
    • the establishment of scientific reference areas for monitoring natural variability and long-term change or for monitoring the effects of harvesting and other human activities on Antarctic marine living resources and on the ecosystems of which they form part; 
    • the protection of areas to maintain resilience or the ability to adapt to the effects of climate change.
Human activities other than use of  marine living resources can harm the marine environment and could make all or several of the objectives of a CCAMLR MPA unattainable. Some areas in the Southern Ocean, may require additional management and protection efforts despite the regulative measures already taken by the ATCM. 
ASPAs and ASMAs in the marine environment can support CCAMLR MPAs by minimising the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes; protecting important species colonies, breeding or nursing areas against all unnecessary and potentially damaging human activities; avoiding degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of a certain area; and reducing the risk of vessel accidents and impacts from logistic activities.
IUCN encourages the ATCM to take the necessary steps to identify the need to designate ASMAs or ASPAs  in CCAMLR MPAs and, where appropriate, to take action. ASMAs aim to avoid possible conflicts of activities, improve cooperation between Parties or minimise environmental impacts. APSAs aim to, amongst other things, provide for areas kept inviolate from human interference so that future comparisons may be possible with localities that have been affected by human activities and representative examples of major marine ecosystems and/or to minimize the cumulative environmental impacts of human activities
The implementation of marine spatial protection and management measures through the ATCM are currently primarily small-scale, coastal based.8 Marine spatial protection and management measures will help contribute to effective, representative and coherent spatial protection of marine biodiversity within the Antarctic Treaty Area. 
2.2 Expanding the ASMA/ASPA network
The development of marine ASMAs and ASPAs is however not dependent of the creation of a CCAMLR MPA. While acknowledging SC-CAMLR9, together with the CAMLR-Commission10, as the lead body on issues relating to spatial protection and management of Antarctic marine biodiversity, decisions and deliberations of the ATCM have confirmed that this “does not preclude in any way the development by the CEP of ASPAs and ASMAs which have in whole or in part a marine component”.11
IUCN therefore encourages the ATCM to take further action to put into operation its specific objectives of the Protocol on Environmental Protection concerning marine spatial protection and management through the designation of ASMAs and ASPA.
3. Collaboration not duplication 
The implementation of complementary and harmonized spatial protection and management of marine biodiversity across the Antarctic Treaty System12 will require increased collaboration between the ATCM and CCAMLR relating to the identification, management and monitoring of marine areas in a manner consistent with the management objectives that are common to both bodies. 
The need – and opportunity – for increased cooperation between the ATCM and CCAMLR arises from common objectives for the management and protection of the marine environment and the complementary competence concerning the identification, management and monitoring of marine areas. As identified by the 2011CCAMLR MPA Workshop in Brest and by several parties to the ATCM, the objectives relating to identification and implementation of MPAs under CCAMLR are comparable to those of ASPAs and ASMAs (see tables below). 13 
One field for increased cooperation between ATCM and CCAMLR is for example the identification, management and monitoring of representative areas.14
3.1 Representative areas 
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the CAMLR Convention also provide for the specific protection and management of representative areas. The CCAMLR MPA Workshop has also acknowledged the need for such measures. 
In 2009, the joint CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop noted that a representative system of marine protected areas would serve the purpose of conserving representative components of Antarctic marine biodiversity.15
Representative areas for ecosystem resilience and adaptation
The joint CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop also noted that a representative system of marine protected areas could also be designed in such a way to ‘provide areas to increase the resilience of the Antarctic marine ecosystem to climate change or other impacts’. 16
Maintaining representative examples of marine ecosystems of sufficient scale, with minimal or no human impact, affords space and time for organisms to adapt to incremental changes in ocean conditions (e.g., salinity, temperature) and sudden shocks including severe storms or undersea earthquakes. Most species have evolved some capacity to survive these periodic stressors. However, research of phenomena such as coral bleaching suggests that species that are less-stressed by human activities have a greater capacity to recover from extreme events.17
Studies in other non-Antarctic ecosystems suggest that reduction of non-climatic stressors enhances the resilience of biodiversity to climate change and ocean acidification.18 Accordingly, ASMAs and ASPAs could provide beneficial conditions for the natural adaptation of species and ecosystems by insulating representative examples from stressors associated with human activity. Parties to the ATCM have previously noted that ASPAs and a protected areas system should become an increasingly important tool for mitigating the impacts of climate change, by ensuring that other pressures are minimized.19
Increased collaboration in the identification, management and monitoring of areas that are of interest to both the ATCM and CCAMLR could be facilitated by the following actions:
    1) continuous and increased engagement with SC-CAMLR, for example by providing relevant data and expertise to the appropriate fora and processes such as the CCAMLR MPA workshop (August 2011), or by providing additional information to the protected areas database; 
    1) formal recognition – possibly by an ATCM measure – of the need to enhance collaboration between the ATCM and CCAMLR, incorporating the establishment of procedures concerning the identification, management and monitoring of areas that are of interest to both ATCM and CCAMLR objectives; 
    2) recognition of the need for – and establishment of – further, in-depth joint discussions with CCAMLR concerning the identification, management and monitoring of areas in accordance with ATCM and CCAMLR objectives (such action could include the use of CCAMLR bioregionalization process to support ASPA and ASMA proposals); 
    3) drawing on the above discussions, the ATCM should discuss and accept ASPA and AMSA proposals in accordance with the ATCM’s rules of procedure.
4. Conclusions 
The marine environment faces a number of potentially damaging and often cumulative human activities. IUCN encourages the ATCM to actively complement, where appropriate and relevant, CCAMLR MPA designations through ASPAs or ASMAs, so the specific objectives of any given CCAMLR MPA are not threatened or undermined by activities outside of the jurisdiction of C-CAMLR. 
C-CAMLR seeks to identify which actions by other elements of the Antarctic Treaty System, such as the ATCM, should be pursued to support the specific objectives of an MPA once established. Parties to the AT, should, based on the recommendations by C-CAMLR, take the appropriate responses through its own mechanisms and establish, if pertinent for the objectives of the CCAMLR MPA, ASMAs and ASPAs for human activities under AT jurisdiction. 
IUCN encourages the ATCM to further build on the evolving efforts to establish coordination between ATCM and CCAMLR concerning spatial protection and management of Antarctic marine biodiversity
