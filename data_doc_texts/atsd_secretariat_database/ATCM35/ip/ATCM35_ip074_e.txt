Results of Russian activity for penetrating subglacial Lake Vostok in the season 2011–12
On 5 February 2011 (end of seasonal operations at Vostok station in the season of 2010/11) the depth of the ice borehole 5G comprised 3720.47 m. It was known from data of earlier seismic and radar measurements of the ice strata in the borehole area that this value was 3750±20 m. So before the beginning of the season of 2011/12, 30±20 m of ice remained to the ice-water boundary. Given that the ice drilling rate in the last week of the 2010/11 season was 1.8 m/day, it was supposed that the remaining 10–50 m of ice could be overcome through January 2012 with simultaneous penetration to surface waters of Lake Vostok. All these operations were undertaken in accordance with permit No. 67 of 23 November 2010, issued by Roshydromet to the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute upon the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Commission on Consideration of Applications for Activity of Russian Citizens and Legal Entities in the Antarctic and Issuance of Permits.
The main idea of environmentally-friendly penetration to Lake Vostok through the deep borehole 5G, filled with a mixture of kerosene and Freon, is a fact that the ice sheet strata is in the floating state and the pressure at the “ice-water” boundary corresponds to the ice column weight (overburden pressure). At ice drilling the overburden pressure is compensated by hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid in the borehole. By decreasing the amount of the drilling fluid one can provide the overburden pressure undercompensation, i.e., create such conditions when the lake water pressure at the given point exceeds the pressure of the drilling fluid column.
Under such conditions at the moment of the borehole bottom contact with the lake surface the drilling fluid should be displaced by lake water moving upward the hole over a height, corresponding to the overburden pressure undercompensation. Penetration of the used drilling fluid to the lake is excluded as it is hydrophobic and much lighter than water. 
On 28 November 2011, aircraft DC-3 BT67 Bassler Turbo made the first in the new season landing at Vostok station delivering there seven specialists of the glacial-drilling team of the seasonal 57th RAE under leadership of Professor Nikolay Vasiliev, Head of the Chair of Borehole Drilling of the St. Petersburg State Mining University.
On 30 November after a short acclimatization period to highland conditions, the team began work for reactivation of the drilling complex and the ice borehole. During December they had to make repair of some technical units and assemblies of the drilling winch, check and revive the working capacity of electronic equipment and upgrade the drill with new components brought from Petersburg. Beside it was necessary to check the change of the borehole diameter by vertical, drill out the places of its narrowing that occur due to horizontal deformation of the glacial strata as a result of its non-uniform motion speeds by vertical, sample drilling fluid from different horizons of the entire borehole, measure density of this fluid and if necessary introduce corrections making the density close to the value of 0.91 g/cm3 and measure the vertical profile of temperature and pressure distribution in the drilling fluid layer. Only after completing all these operations it was possible to continue drilling of new ice. Ice drilling in the borehole began on 2 January 2012.
On 13 January the borehole depth reached a mark of 3738.5 m. Then some technical problems appeared in the carrying cable resulting in interruption of drilling. During this period new geophysical observations of temperature and pressure at the borehole bottom were made and a borehole segment was drilled out to a diameter of 136 mm in the layer of 3720–3738.5 m. The direct drilling operations began only on 20 January. Until 31 January the average daily drilling rate was 1.5–2 m/day, and on the last day of January the borehole depth was at a mark of 3760 m. From this moment the busiest days in the drilling program began. New data on ice temperature at the borehole bottom showed that the place where the calculated ice melting could begin at the given pressure should be at a mark of 3766±16 m. The drilling season was to be finished not later than 5 February 2012, when the last in this season aircraft with project participants was to fly from Vostok station. These circumstances made the project participants feel some uncertainty in its successful completion at the beginning of February 2012. Another important problem was the issue of advisability of transfer to drilling the lower ice horizons by a thermal drill adding to the lower borehole part a special organosilicon fluid. The point is that such change in the drilling technology using a thermal drill envisages drilling in a continuous cycle and a complete absence of the drill descent and ascent operations. Transfer to a new type of drilling and introduction of a new component of the drilling fluid based on silicon compounds required interrupting the drilling process as a minimum for 2–3 days. This meant that practical drilling by the thermal method in the summer season 2011/12 became principally impossible due to a strict time limit. That is why the drilling team made a decision to continue drilling by means of electrical-mechanical drill up to the last moment – communication from Progress station about the aircraft departure to Vostok.
On 4 February, when the borehole bottom was at a depth of 3766 m, serious problems appeared with tearing the drilled 1.5 m ice core from the main ice body. It was decided to break this ice core into two approximately equal parts 70–80 cm each. Whereas the upper ice core segment by its external look was not different in any way from similar ice samples above it, the lateral sides of the lower core portion were “glazed’ in such a way as if the core was put into warm water. After the next descent of the drill it turned out that there is no further ice drilling. Only after pumping out 3–4 liters of fluid from the near-bottom part of the borehole ice drilling was resumed. The fluid recovered to the surface was frozen water about which the electrical conductivity sensor mounted on the drill also signaled. Water freezing occurred in the upper horizons of the borehole where the temperature of lateral sides was about −55°С. So, at a depth of 3766 m the drill in borehole 5G hit the water lens. As suggested by N.I. Vasiliev, this water lens was formed as a a result of hydrostatic stresses in the near-bottom part of the borehole at the attempts to separate the ice core from the glacial body when the drill was performing a piston function raising upward the entire main strata of drilling fluid. Simultaneously strong relaxations occurred in the near-bottom zone, resulting in the formation of micro-cracks in the bottom part of the glacier. Water from the subglacial lake being under pressure 3 atm higher than that of the drilling fluid column, rushed through the micro-cracks to the bottom part of the borehole and was as a result raised to the surface. So the Russian investigators collected the first samples of lake water even before the final penetration to the lake. Similar to all days in January, the drilling operations in the borehole continued in the 24 h regime and at 20-25 Moscow time at a depth mark of 3769.3 m (along the ice core length) the long-awaited event took place. The fact of contact of the drill bore bit with the lake water body was registered by sensors of conductivity, pressure and the moment of rest at rotation of the drilling bore bit in the ice cutting process. The results of these measurements were registered to a video-camera. At this moment the main goal of drilling operators was an immediate recovery of the drill to the surface. The point is that the bore bit diameter is 135 mm and the ice borehole has the same diameter. However between the drill core tube surface and lateral sides of the borehole there is a micron clearance, which will be immediately filled with water under pressure. The ice sides of the borehole are within a below zero temperature range, therefore the seeped super thin water layer will practically freeze at once and then it will be impossible to raise the drill to the surface, as it will freeze to the lateral sides of the borehole. The operation of changing the operating regime of the drilling complex winch was performed already in 4 seconds after the contact of the drill with the surface lake water layer took place. At a height of about 30–40 m from the lower ice surface it was possible to tear the drill from lake water that has risen by this value along the borehole. The drilling fluid level has also risen. About 1.5 m3 poured out across the upper edge to special trays after which it was transferred to empty barrels. In winter of 2012 two specialists-drillers of the 57th RAE at Vostok station will perform monitoring of the state of the borehole.
On 29 February 2012 when the borehole parameters were measured, the drill equipped with a caliper stopped at descent at a mark of 3176.7 m with the drilling fluid level at a mark of 43.5 m. One can suggest that the level of water from the subglacial Lake Vostok has risen by 592.7 m from the lower glacial surface. What is the reason for this phenomenon? In our opinion it is in occurrence of a hydraulic fracture at the borehole lateral side to which a large amount of the drilling fluid went. Such process is quite common in drilling of gas and oil wells. As a rule, it is connected with disturbance of the drilling fluid density distribution by vertical and the local peculiarities of mountain rock structure, in which drilling is made. Due to this process the upper level of the drilling fluid remains unchanged even at injection of additional fluid volume.
Analyzing implementation of the project on penetration to subglacial Lake Vostok the following main results should be noted:
    • the accuracy of radar and seismic measurements of the ice sheet thickness at the place of location of subglacial Lake Vostok corresponds to the calculated parameters (±20 m);
    • the water pressure in the lake surface layer is compensated by pressure of the glacier body, which is afloat;
    • the artificially created effect of undercompensation of the drilling fluid column pressure in the borehole provided ecological cleanliness of lake surface water the contact of which with the drilling fluid was only directly in the ice borehole;
    • the actual content of dissolved gases in the surface water layer did not present any real threat for the emmission of these gases to the borehole surface;
    • the peculiarities of drilling operations in the season of 2011–12 and a very limited time frame for the possibility of performing seasonal work at Vostok station have not permitted us at the final stage of drilling operations to transfer to drilling by a thermal drill with application of intermediate organosilicon drilling fluid;
    • presence of a hydraulic fracture in the lower part of the borehole (deeper than a mark of 3100 m), caused by disturbance of the vertical distribution of the drilling fluid density in the borehole resulted in the non-planned rise of lake surface water along the borehole by almost 600 m.
In general, implementation of the deep drilling project at Vostok station that was finished with penetration to surface water layers of Lake Vostok, corresponded practically completely to the parameters set forth in the CEE for the ecologically clean water sampling from surface layers of subglacial Lake Vostok, and theoretical suggestions of Russian specialists about the physics of the processes at the drill contact with the lake water layer were confirmed in practice.
