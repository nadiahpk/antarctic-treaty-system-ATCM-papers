Analyses of the Antarctic protected areas system using spatial information
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
Australia has acquired a comprehensive dataset of spatial information representing the boundaries of all Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs). This dataset is now freely available, via the Secretariat, for use in accordance with basic terms and conditions. This paper presents examples of how the dataset can assist in assessing and further developing the Antarctic protected areas system, and support other CEP activities.
Background
At CEP XIII (2010) Australia introduced ATCM XXXIII/WP54 Enhancing the Antarctic Protected Areas Database to help assess and further develop the protected areas system. The paper described possible enhancements to the Antarctic Protected Areas Database, and recalled the Committee’s previous agreement to:
    • consider what information about protected areas could usefully be contained in the protected areas database; and
    • promote the use of global positioning systems (GPS) to accurately define protected area boundaries, manage such information in the protected area database, and use such information in conjunction with Resolution 3 (2008) to assess representativeness.
Australia undertook to work with the Secretariat and interested parties to further develop options and to bring an updated proposal to CEP XIV.
At CEP XIV (2011) the Committee supported the revised proposal presented by Australia in ATCM XXXIV/WP32 Enhancing the Antarctic Protected Areas Database to help assess and further develop the protected areas system, and agreed:
    • that the Antarctic Protected Areas Database should be expanded to include fields representing: (1) primary reason for designation; and (2) main Environmental Domain represented;
    • to encourage proponents to make ASPA and ASMA boundaries available in a digital format suitable for use in a GIS where possible, and to provide this information to the Secretariat for central management and access via the Antarctic Protected Areas Database;
    • to request the Secretariat to modify the Antarctic Protected Areas Database as necessary to accommodate these changes; and
    • to recommend that the ATCM modify the coversheet for Working Papers presenting ASPAs and ASMAs appended to Resolution 1 (2008) to allow the Secretariat to capture the relevant information for inclusion in the database.
During the meeting Australia advised that it was in consultation with a private company that had prepared a comprehensive dataset of spatial information representing the boundaries of all existing ASPAs and ASMAs. Australia noted that it planned to acquire the dataset, and would work with the Secretariat during the intersessional period with a view to making the data widely available.
Dataset of spatial information for ASPAs and ASMAs
In 2011 Australia purchased from Environmental Research and Assessment1 a comprehensive dataset of spatial information for all ASPAs and ASMAs. The dataset includes information that represents both a point location and a polygon (boundary) for each Area, together with information about the data source and credits for data creation. Australia has made the dataset available to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat at no cost, with the intention of allowing the data to be freely accessible under basic terms and conditions of use (including appropriate attribution of credit).
Consistent with the Committee’s agreement at CEP XIV, the Secretariat has modified the Antarctic Protected Areas Database to include additional fields and to allow access to the spatial data (see Secretariat Paper 2 Secretariat Report 2011/12). In a practical sense, the spatial data for each Area can now be used in conjunction with the information contained in the Antarctic Protected Areas Database (i.e. Proponent, Location, Approximate Area; Summary; Designation; Last Review; Next Review; Annex V formation adoption; Modification / Review summary; Primary reason for designation; Main environmental domain represented; Legal Status; and a link to the current Management Plan).
Examples of spatial analysis with ASPA / ASMA dataset
In ATCM XXXIV/WP32, Australia presented several examples of potential applications for mapping and spatial analysis of protected areas, using only information for the 11 ASPAs and 2 ASMAs for which Australia is a/the proponent.
Attachment A to this Information Paper contains:
    • Summary information for each Antarctic Specially Protected Area and Antarctic Specially Managed Area (e.g. area, primary reason for designation, main environmental domain represented, other environmental domains represented, main Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Region2 represented and distance to nearest year-round station) – see Table 1.
    • Examples of statistics that can be generated using spatial information now available for the full suite of 71 ASPAs and 7 ASMAs – see Table 2.
Conclusion
As noted in previous Australian Working Papers, the use of modern tools to analyse spatial information for ASPAs and ASMAs can assist to assess and further develop the Antarctic protected areas system and support other CEP activities (e.g. reporting on the state of Antarctic environments, and facilitating the production of maps for CEP reports). The range of applications will continue to grow as further spatial information about Antarctica becomes available.
