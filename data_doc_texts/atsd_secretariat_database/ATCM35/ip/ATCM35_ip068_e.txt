Progress of Ukraine on Designation of Broad-scale Management System in the Vernadsky Station Area
Informational Paper submitted by Ukraine
On the previous Meetings Ukraine stressed that in the Vernadsky station area, including surrounding islands, the scientific activity and subsidiary logistic support are widened and the continuing growth of tourist visits is also registered for the last years. This stimulated Ukraine to raise up at the CEP XII (Baltimore, 2009) the issue on designation of a broad-scale and comprehensive management system with regards not only to separate islands (as, for instance, in case of site-specific guidelines for visitors) but to the whole area contiguous to Vernadsky station with the total square of about 1800 km2 (ATCM ХХХII IP-062).
As the mentioned area comprises vast marine component, Ukrainian delegation to the CCAMLR during 2005-2011 has submitted for consideration of the Scientific Committee a number of papers suggesting to designate a Marine Protected Area around Vernadsky station for the purpose of protection of environmental values as well as areas with special scientific interest (2005-CCAMLR-XXIV/BG/19, 2006-WG-EMM-06/33, 2007-CCAMLR-XXVI/BG/11, 2011-SC-CCAMLR-XXX/BG/11).
During the 2011/2012 summer season more than 40 research submergings to the depth up to 50 meters were conducted for the purpose of phyto- and zoobenthos sampling, estimation of species diversity, qualitative and quantitative composition of benthos cenoses, biomass of separate species and also for photo and video filming. The research was based on the NaGISA Protocol (Natural Geography in Shore Areas).Two test polygons were created at the seacoast of Galindez Island (Vernadsky station). It was suggested exterminating Skua Creek as the first stage of further designation of possible Marine Protected Area.
Ukraine invites all interested Parties to take part in further discussion on strategic views of environmental protection and possible management for this area.
