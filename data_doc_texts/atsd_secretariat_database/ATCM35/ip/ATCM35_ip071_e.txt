On preparation for ratification of Annex VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
Ratification of the adopted at XXVII ATCM in Cape Town Measure 4 (2004) “Insurance and Contingency Planning for Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area” and at XXVIII ATCM in Stockholm of Measure 1 (2005) “Liability Arising From Environmental Emergencies” made it necessary to change the legislature in force in the Russian Federation. This was connected with the absence in the Russian legislature of the legally set standards regulating activity of our citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic.
At XXXI ATCM in Kiev in 2008, Russia presented XXXI ATCM IP43 On development of Draft Law “On regulation of activities of the Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic”, which outlined in much detail the structure and content of the draft law developed in 2007 “On regulation of activities of the Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic”. However in May 2008 there were serious changes in the structure of the Government of the Russian Federation. The Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Roshydromet) that had prepared this draft law jointly with the other bodies of the federal executive power was transferred under administration of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology (Minpriroda). Authorities of the other power bodies of Russia were also changed.  These structural changes resulted in the need for significant corrections of the draft law. This work was done a group of lawyers of Minpriroda of Russia jointly with the representatives of Roshydromet. As a result, the new draft law has 13 articles instead of 22 articles in the initial variant.
The structure of the new draft law “On regulation of activities of the Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic” is as follows:
    • Article 1 “Basic definitions”;
    • Article 2 “Legal regulation of activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 3 “Principles of implementing activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 4 “State regulation of activity in the Antarctic»;
    • Article 5 “Organization of activity in the Antarctic in the interests of the Russian Federation”;
    • Article 6 “Permission for implementing activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 7 “Provision of safety of activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 8 “Financial provision of activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 9 “Investigation of accidents in implementing activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 10 “Search and rescue operations and elimination of implications of accidents”;
    • Article 11 “Liability for violation of the law regulating relations occurring in implementing activity in the Antarctic”;
    • Article 12 “Civil liability (property) for inflicting the Antarctic environmental damage”;
    • Article 13 “Entry into force of this Federal Law”.
Simultaneously, changes were also introduced into the legislature of Russia in force for a possibility of its application to the activity of citizens and organizations in the Antarctic.
These changes concerned:
    • the Federal Law “On acts of civil status”;
    • the Civil Code of the Russian Federation;
    • the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation;
    • the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offence.

In December 2011, the Government of the Russian Federation has submitted the draft law “On regulation of activity of Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic” to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation (Lower house of the Russian Parliament). According to the existing procedure, the draft laws in the State Duma are considered in three stages:
    • consideration of conceptual provisions of the draft law;
    • consideration of some articles of the draft law with introduction of corrections and amendments;
    • general editing of the draft law.
On 27 April 2012, the State Duma by a majority of votes has adopted the Draft Law in the second reading. At present it is very likely that consideration of the draft law by the State Duma will be completed in the near future and it will be transferred for subsequent consideration to the Council of the Federation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation (Upper House of the Russian Parliament) even before the beginning of work of XXXV ATCM.
Adoption of the draft law will create legal grounds for undertaking ratification procedures of the ATCM measures, which could not be approved before introduction of corresponding changes into the legislature of our country in force.
In the course of preparation of the Russian draft law a serous problem appeared of further enforcement of Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
In terms of the Russian legislature for calculation of the amount of financial provision covering the cost of response actions in implementing the specific types of activities it is necessary to develop an approximate list, scope and methodology of calculation of such actions.
In case the norms of domestic legislatures of the countries-participants to the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol differ in this part, then in reimbursement of the cost of response measures, discords may arise in determining its amount.
We believe that these issues should be addressed in the framework of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and by adoption of a special Measure for unification of approaches to the calculations.
