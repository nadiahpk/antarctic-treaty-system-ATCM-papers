COMNAP Survey of National Antarctic Programs on Oil Spill Contingency Planning








COMNAP Survey of National Antarctic Programs on Oil Spill Contingency Planning

Background
COMNAP has actively discussed fuel handling in Antarctica in order to provide guidelines to COMNAP National Antarctic Programs on best practice to avoid an incident, and best practice in the event of an oil spill. In 1996, COMNAP conducted a survey of COMNAP Member National Antarctic Programs, the information provided in response to that survey (presented as COMNAP IP62 ATCMXXII, 1998) led to a review of the then current guidelines and resulted,  in 2008, in the COMNAP Fuel Manual (v.1 April 2008), as presented in IP91 to ATCM XXXI (Kyiv, 2008). The COMNAP Fuel Manual replaced and superseded the set of four fuel-related COMNAP guidelines, originally published in 1992 and 1993. 
This paper presents the results of a new COMNAP survey undertaken during the 2011/2012 intercessional period, which is, in effect, an update of a survey carried out in 1996. The 1996 survey showed, inter alia, that 40% of all Antarctic stations had no oil spill contingency plans in place. Since that time there have been several Resolutions (Res 1 (1997) ATCMXXI, Res 6 (1998) ATCMXXXII, and Res 3 (2005) ATCMXXVIII) and the Environmental Protocol itself (Article 15 and Annex VI, Article – not yet in force) that refer to and require various contingency planning actions related to fuel management or response action.
This recent survey asked similar questions as in the 1996 survey in order to identify changes over the past 15 years. The CEP includes “Emergency Response and contingency planning” in its 5-year plan as a priority 3 issue, which will be discussed in the near future. COMNAP presents this survey and results in order to provide some background and practical information on the status of contingency planning amongst National Antarctic Programs.
In addition in the 2011/2012 survey, COMNAP also requested from National Antarctic Programs a list of equipment they hold in Antarctica that could be used in response to an oil spill. This list of equipment is not provided as part of this Information Paper, but will be used to build up a COMNAP database to assist National Antarctic Programs should they have to respond regionally or collectively to an oil spill.

Summary of survey results
Twenty-two of the twenty-eight COMNAP Member National Antarctic Programs replied to the 2011/2012 survey. Of the six National Antarctic Programs that did not offer responses, information for four of them was found for survey question 1.1 in the EIES. This effectively resulted in answers for twenty-six of the twenty-eight COMNAP members for that question. IAATO was also invited to reply to the questions related to vessels and to training, and their replies are included where indicated.   








Question 1. Do your stations/bases have an oil spill contingency plan in place:
a) Of the 28 National Antarctic Programs:
    • Twenty replied that they did have contingency plans in place (72%). 
    • One replied that the question was not applicable (since they had no bases); and 
    • One replied that their station did not a contingency plan in place but that it was currently in preparation. 
Of the National Antarctic Programs which did not respond:
    • Information for two of them was found in the EIES which indicated that they had contingency plans in place.
Therefore, this is confirmation that 22 of 27 (89%) National Antarctic Programs have contingency plans in place at their stations/bases (1 of 28 was not applicable) and 4 are unknown/no response/or no information in EIES. 

b) The survey also asked when the contingency plans were written/produced: 
    • Most of the plans are from the 1990’s with only 20% of the plans being updated after 2008.



Question 2. Do the contingency plans follow the COMNAP Guidelines:
    • Of the 20 National Antarctic Programs which replied that contingency plans were in place, 16 (80%) replied that they followed the COMNAP Guidelines.



Question 3. Are your contingency plans publicly available:
    • 30% of National Antarctic Programs reported that their oil spill contingency were available through the EIES.
    • 27% of National Antarctic Programs said their contingency plans were publically available, mostly via the internet.



Question 4. Have the contingency plans been regularly tested?  Do you conduct theoretical training and/or practical exercises at stations/bases? If yes, how often.
    • Fifteen of the National Antarctic Programs replied that they do conduct theoretical and/or practical training on oil spill response at least once a year, sometimes twice a year (75%).  Some carried out practical exercises on a monthly basis, another up to 20 times per year. 




Question 5. Do you have any emergency response or contingency plans for issues other than fuel spills:
    • Seventeen of the National Antarctic Programs replied that they have other contingency plans (85%) -  (e.g. environmental, flight information, search and rescue, chemical spill, medical emergency, hazardous climate conditions, fire or explosion, field safety, missing persons).
    • IAATO replied that they have a wide Emergency Contingency Plan and EMER plan.


Question 6. Do the vessels your National Antarctic Program currently operates have a ship-board oil spill pollution emergency plan (SOPEP):
    • All National Antarctic Programs that responded indicated that all vessels have a SOPEP plan.
    • IAATO replied that all vessels have their own standardized SOPEP plan, as is required under MARPOL. They also replied that vessels and land operators have regular drills.


Question 7. Have you established a plan to respond to emergencies in conjunction with other national Antarctic operators:

    • Five of the National Antarctic Programs responded that they have established plans to respond to emergencies in conjunction with other National Antarctic Programs. 
    • Five other National Antarctic Programs responded: 
    • while they did not have a plan in conjunction with other National Antarctic Programs, they did have an agreement in place with their maritime safety authority for emergency response in the Antarctic region; 
    • that such a plan would be likely in the future due to proximity of a planned new station;
    • there was no other National Antarctic Program station operating in the “neighbourhood”;
    • that while no plan was in place they did work closely with another National Antarctic Program on this;
    • that while no plan was in place, they had undertaken joint oil spill and emergency response exercises with several other programs.
