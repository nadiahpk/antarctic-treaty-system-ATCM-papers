An Update on Biological Prospecting in Antarctica and
Recent Policy Developments at the International Level

1.	Introduction

The present information paper provides an update on biological prospecting in Antarctica, as well as recent relevant policy developments at the international level. Biological prospecting continues to be a topic of interest and concern to the Parties of the Antarctic Treaty System, and was most recently discussed at ATCM 33.  The present document aims to facilitate further discussions relating to this agenda item by providing an update on biological prospecting activities in Antarctica since the last ATCM. The document also presents an update on recent policy developments at the international level of relevance to biological prospecting.

2.	An update on biological prospecting

A comprehensive review of the information contained in the Antarctic Biological Prospecting Database was submitted to ATCM 32 in the form of Working Paper 1 (the Antarctic Biological Prospecting Database). This document provides an update on recent developments related to biological prospecting in Antarctica that have transpired since that review document was written. The information in this document has been collected and collated by University of Barcelona and UNU-IAS researchers  and through collaborative research.

The database continues to be hosted on-line at http://www.bioprospector.org/bioprospector/antarctica/search.jsp. It contains records related to actual and potential commercial applications obtained from a variety of existing sources, including publicly available information on the Internet, records of appropriate patent offices, market trends, demand for biological compounds and genetic resources, and trends in research and development. At the time of ATCM 32, the database contained a total of 187 records related to actual or potential commercial applications based on Antarctic genetic resources. An additional nine records were added prior to ATCM 33. This paper presents 22 new patents or applications, which have been added to the database, bringing the total to 218.  The records have been sourced from publicly available patent databases, and refer to patents granted and patent applications filed from late 2010 to mid-2012. 

Twelve of the twenty-two patent applications granted between 2010 and 2012 relate to krill, demonstrating a continuing interest in this organism as a source of commercial development. The new krill-related records refer to the use of krill extracts and oils in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, including the treatment and prevention of several disease states and disorders (skin cancer, diabetes, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, central nervous system diseases and injuries, etc.). They also relate to methods for extracting krill oil and preparing krill meal. These patent applications were filed by companies in Canada, Chile, Norway, US, Japan, China and Korea. Part of the documentation is available only in Chinese and Korean, limiting its utility.

Three patent applications were filed by Chinese companies and universities. The first of these is a patent application relating to an Antarctic cold-adapted microbial extracellular polysaccharide capable of improving the body’s immunity. This polysaccharide is prepared by culturing, fermenting, separating and purifying Antarctic cold-adapted bacteria (Pseudoaltermonas sp.). The invention belongs to the technical field of pharmaceuticals, health-care and nutraceuticals. Another patent application filed by a Chinese university is an invention derived from the fungus oidiodendron truncatum, which is separated from the soil of the Antarctic Great Wall Station, relating to the preparation method of a compound used as a cell proliferation inhibitor. The last Chinese application relates to the use of an Antarctic sea ice bacterium (Colwellia) in the preparation of a method for tuna preservation through freezing. 

A new record from Korea relates to anti-inflammatory properties found in the Antarctic lichen Ramalina terebata. The described use is for treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases or immune diseases, which are useful in the alleviation and improvement of symptoms. The Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute filed the patent, and unfortunately the documentation is available only in Korean. 

A new American record also relates to pharmaceuticals, and specifically the isolation of extremophilic organisms from the Lakes of Schirmacher Oasis located in the East Antarctic Dronning Maud Land.  The isolates exhibit anticancer and antimicrobial properties, and can be used as new therapies for the treatment and prevention of cancer and microbiologically-mediated diseases. The patent was filed by the US company UAB Research Foundation. 

An Indian patent application pertains to cosmetic, nutritional or pharmaceutical compositions comprising extracts isolated from the Deschampsia antarctica plant. These extracts exhibit promise in preventing, mitigating, or treating various disorders pertaining to the skin. Deschampsia antarctica is the only native Gramineae found in the Antarctic and is mostly found in Antarctic Peninsula and its offshore islands.

The last record, from Malaysia, relates to the fields of enzyme technology and microbiology, and particularly, to a process of producing a novel enzyme at low temperature. The enzyme is isolated from a novel purified Antarctic microorganism (Leucosporodium antarcticum). The application was filed by the University Putra of Malaysia. 

While the information above relates to new patent applications, two previous applications already listed in the database have now been granted. The patent granted on a 2006 application by Neptune Technologies & Bioresources (Canada) relates to a method that can prevent or treat several diseases. This new krill-related record has to do with the administration of a multi-therapeutic extract derived from krill.

A patent has also been granted to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (India), and relates to a novel method of cloning and expressing a gene from an Antarctic Psychotropic Bacterium Pseudomonas Syringae. This bacterium is used to produce low temperature labile proteins of pharmaceutical significance, given that it has the ability to grow at 0ºC and transcribe at this temperature both in vitro and in vivo.

3.	Recent policy developments at the international level

Recent policy developments relevant to genetic resources, bioprospecting and access and benefit-sharing have taken place in a number of international fora. Of particular note, are the developments within the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) which are described below.

A.	The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)

The tenth meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties (COP-10), which took place in Nagoya, Japan, from 18 to 29 October 2010, adopted the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Nagoya Protocol is an international agreement which aims at sharing the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding, thereby contributing to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components. The Nagoya Protocol will enter into force 90 days after the fiftieth instrument of ratification. The COP established an Open-ended Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya Protocol on ABS (ICNP) as an interim governing body for the Nagoya Protocol until the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol.

The Nagoya Protocol applies to genetic resources that are covered by the CBD, and to the benefits arising from their utilization. The Nagoya Protocol also covers traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources that are covered by the CBD and the benefits arising from its utilization. The Nagoya Protocol sets out core obligations for its contracting parties to take measures in relation to access to genetic resources, benefit-sharing and compliance. The Protocol will create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources by establishing more predictable conditions for access to genetic resources, and by helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting party providing the genetic resources.

The Protocol, as adopted, does not apply to the Antarctic Treaty area. It also only applies within national jurisdictions of countries, and provides for bilateral transfer of genetic resources between provider countries and users. However, Article 10 of the Protocol provides a possible pathway for developing a global multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism. The article states that 

“Parties shall consider the need for and modalities of a global multilateral benefit sharing mechanism to address the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from the utilization of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources that occur in transboundary situations or for which it is not possible to grant or obtain prior informed consent. The benefits shared by users of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources through this mechanism shall be used to support the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components globally.” 

Article 10 thus provides for an enabling clause that could be used towards future negotiation of a benefit-sharing mechanism and its applicability in the Antarctic Treaty area and marine areas beyond national jurisdiction has already been subject to some debate.

B.	The Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (The Working Group)

The Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (The Working Group) was established by General Assembly resolution 59/2 in November 2004, to: 

•	survey the past and present activities of the UN and other international organizations on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction; 
•	examine the scientific, technical, economic, legal, environmental, socioeconomic and other aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of such biodiversity; 
•	identify key issues and questions where more detailed background studies would facilitate consideration by States of the conservation and sustainable use of such biodiversity; and 
•	indicate, where appropriate, possible options and approaches to promote international cooperation and coordination for the conservation and sustainable use of such biodiversity. 

The 4th meeting of the Working Group took place in from 31 May - 3 June 2011. The meeting was mandated to continue discussions of the legal regime on marine genetic resources, as well as marine protected areas and environmental impact assessment processes in areas beyond national jurisdiction; and develop recommendations for submission to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.

The 4th meeting made substantial progress in moving beyond the previously deadlocked positions on marine genetic resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction by agreeing on a way forward towards a more concrete outcome for its work in the long term. The Working Group adopted by consensus a set of recommendations to initiate a process on the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction, by identifying gaps and ways forward, including through the implementation of existing instruments and the possible development of a multilateral agreement under UNCLOS. The recommendations also include a “package” of issues to be addressed as a whole in this process, namely: marine genetic resources, including questions on benefits-sharing; measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas and environmental impact assessments; capacity building and the transfer of marine technology. 

Specifically, the Working Group recommended to the General Assembly that:

•	a process be initiated by the General Assembly, with a view to ensuring that the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ effectively addresses issues by identifying gaps and ways forward, including through the implementation of existing instruments and the possible development of a multilateral agreement under UNCLOS;
•	such a process address the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ, in particular, together and as a whole, MGRs, including questions on benefit-sharing, measures such as area-based management tools, including MPAs, EIAs, capacity building and the transfer of marine technology;
•	such a process take place in the Working Group and in the format of intersessional workshops, aimed at improving understanding of the issues and clarifying key questions as an input to the work of the Working Group; 
•	the mandate of the Working Group be reviewed and, as appropriate, amended with a view to undertaking the tasks entrusted by the recommendations; and
•	the Working Group be reconvened in 2012 to make progress on all issues under examination within the Working Group and to provide recommendations to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.

These recommendations were adopted by the 66th session of the General Assembly in in December 2011 (resolution 66/231). 

The fifth meeting of the Working Group will take place in New York from 7 to 11 May, 2012, and will continue considering the items in resolution 66/231, including modalities for intersessional work. 

C.	The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA)

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), which entered into force in 2004, is a comprehensive treaty whose objectives are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from their use, in harmony with the CBD, for sustainable agriculture and food security. The centrepiece of the Treaty is a ‘multilateral system for access and benefit-sharing’ which for certain categories of PGRFA guarantees facilitated access in return for benefit-sharing.

The fourth session of the Governing Body (GB 4) of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (the Treaty or ITPGR) took place from 14-18 March 2011, in Bali, Indonesia. The meeting was tasked with: reviewing implementation of the Treaty’s Multilateral System (MLS) on access and benefit-sharing (ABS); adopting procedures and operational mechanisms to promote compliance and address issues of non-compliance; reviewing implementation of the Treaty’s Funding Strategy; and resolving the outstanding financial rules of the Governing Body. Delegates also discussed: operation of the Third Party Beneficiary; farmers’ rights; implementation of Article 6 (Sustainable Use of Plant Genetic Resources); cooperation with relevant organizations; and the work programme and budget for 2012-2013.

On the MLS, a resolution containing the following topics was adopted:

•	PGRFA held by parties and forming part of the MLS; 
•	PGRFA included by natural and legal persons within the jurisdictions of parties; 
•	PGRFA held by international institutions under Article 15; 
•	documenting the PGRFA within the MLS; 
•	legal and other appropriate measures to provide access through the MLS; 
•	implementation of the MLS; 
•	the work of the ad hoc technical advisory committee on the MLS and the SMTA; 
•	support to parties and users of the MLS; 
•	reviews and assessments under the MLS and the implementation and operation of the standard material transfer agreement (SMTA); 
•	review of the SMTA used by the International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) for non-Annex I PGRFA; and 
•	follow-up by the Secretariat. 

In addition to forming an Ad Hoc Technical Advisory Committee to review the implementation of the MLS, the resolution requests all parties: to report on their PGRFA that are in the MLS; to provide more information to the Secretary on the inclusion of PGRFA in the MLS by natural and legal persons within their jurisdiction; and to take measures to encourage such inclusions. It further urges parties to take necessary legal and other appropriate measures to provide access to PGRFA through the MLS within a clear timeframe. 

The GB also recognizes the importance of the IARCs of the CGRFA, and their valuable contributions to the development of the MLS; and invites other relevant international institutions to enter into agreements with the GB to include their PGRFA collections in the MLS. The GB also requests the Secretary to continue gathering information on PGRFA in the MLS to be used for plant breeding, research and training. 

Regarding the implementation of the standard material transfer agreement (SMTA), the GB: stresses the need to document exchanges under the MLS through SMTA operations; urges parties and international institutions and natural and legal persons to provide such information; and invites parties and stakeholders to explore innovative benefit-sharing measures. 

D.	United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)

The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) is being organized in pursuance of General Assembly Resolution 64/236, and will take place in Brazil on 20-22 June 2012 to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), in Rio de Janeiro, and the 10th anniversary of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. The zero-draft of the outcome document, among other things: 

•	reaffirms the Rio principles and past action plans;
•	assesses progress to date and remaining gaps in the implementation of the major summits on sustainable development;
•	emphasises the importance of engaging major groups, underscoring that a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is broad public participation in decision-making;
•	commits to improving governance and capacity at all levels, to reinvigorate the global partnership for sustainable development;
•	sets out a framework for action in the context of transformation to a green economy; 
•	calls for review of some elements of the institutional framework for sustainable development, including to transform the CDS into a Sustainable Development Council to serve as the authoritative, high-level body for consideration of matters relating to the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and for UNEP to be transformed into  a Specialised Agency of the United Nations.

The zero-draft text also includes a ‘framework for action and follow-up’ based around priority, key, thematic, cross-sectoral issues and areas. These areas include a specific focus on oceans and seas, as well as on biodiversity. 

On oceans and seas, the zero draft text:

•	recognises that oceans are critical to sustaining Earth’s life support systems and stresses the importance of the conservation, sustainable management and equitable sharing of marine and ocean resources; 
•	endorses the Regular Process for the Global Marine Assessment as a credible, robust process, and supports the completion of its first global integrated assessment of the state of the marine environment by 2014; and calls for consideration of assessment findings in the formulation of national, regional and global oceans policy;
•	notes the establishment by the UN General Assembly of an Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to study issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction;
•	agrees to initiate, as soon as possible, the negotiation of an implementing agreement to UNCLOS that would address the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction;
•	calls on countries to advance implementation of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities;
•	proposes to implement an international observing network for ocean acidification and to work collectively to prevent further ocean acidification;
•	notes that despite agreement to restore global fish stocks to sustainable levels by 2015, many stocks continue to be depleted unsustainably and calls upon States to re-commit to maintaining or restoring depleted fish stocks to sustainable levels and to further commit to implementing science-based management plans to rebuild stocks by 2015;
•	urges countries to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by adopting and implementing effective tools, in accordance with international law; and, 
•	notes the agreement on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing approved by FAO in 2009 and urges States that have not yet acceded to the agreement to do so.

On biodiversity the zero draft text welcomes the Nagoya Protocol adopted at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity. It supports mainstreaming of biodiversity and ecosystem services in policies and decision-making processes at international, regional and national levels, and encourages investments in natural capital through appropriate incentives and policies, which support a sustainable and equitable use of biological diversity and ecosystems.
