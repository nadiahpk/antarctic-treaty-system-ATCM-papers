Examples to illustrate the proposed application of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Abstract
Australia provides two examples to illustrate how issues might be presented in a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Plan) for the ATCM, following the format proposed in WP 30 The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting by Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The examples are ‘Antarctic science strategic directions – identifying shared priorities’, and ‘Climate change implications for management and governance – addressing ATME recommendations’. While Australia regards these as appropriate issues for inclusion in a Plan, they are presented here only for the purpose of illustrating how issues can be translated into actions in the Plan. 
Background
Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States have proposed in WP 30 The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting that the Parties agree to develop a Plan for the ATCM. 
Past discussions have referred to the need for a Plan to include issues that have been clearly articulated and well justified. It has also been noted that, for a Plan to be successful, it will be necessary to identify concrete proposals and actions to be taken in specific meetings to advance each issue.
To illustrate how this might be accomplished, Australia presents here two examples of issues, including a brief justification for their inclusion in the Plan, and proposed actions. 
Australia notes that the timing of actions for issues in the Plan cannot be finalised without considering other issues. The allocation of actions to specific meetings and intersessional periods will be dependent on the priority that is ultimately assigned by the Parties to each issue. We anticipate that as the Parties develop the Plan, the Parties will need to consider all proposed issues, their relative priority, and their scheduling, so as to ensure a manageable workload across the period of the Plan. As such, the timing of the actions suggested by Australia are indicative only.

Attachment A: Two examples in work plan format

Issue: Antarctic science strategic directions – identifying shared priorities
Justification: Promoting international cooperation in the conduct of globally significant science in Antarctica is a fundamental aim of the Antarctic Treaty. The ATCM is the appropriate forum for the highest level inter-governmental discussion of shared Antarctic priorities. Accordingly, the ATCM should play a greater role in identifying shared scientific objectives, and advancing international cooperation to achieve these objectives. This would assist individual Parties in directing their national scientific efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and help assist in coordinating projects that require international cooperation to be achieved. 
Priority: 
Action: Compare science strategic priorities, identify shared priorities, and consider cooperation on key priorities

CEP to develop advice on its science requirements.
Parties and observers including SCAR to bring forward information about their strategic science priorities.
Consider science requirements of CEP.
Identify any documented  Antarctic science priorities of other bodies (eg WMO, HCA, IPCC). 
Compare Parties’ strategic science priorities.
Collate information about Antarctic science requests and priorities from other bodies.

Identify shared scientific priorities. 
Initial identification of priorities which would benefit from significant international cooperation.
As appropriate, develop specific proposals for cooperation on key scientific priorities.
Discuss leadership and coordination functions for specific proposals.  




Issue: Climate change implications for management and governance - addressing ATME recommendations
Justification: At ATCM XXXIII in Punta del Este in 2010 the ATCM considered the report of the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Implications of Climate Change for Antarctic Management and Governance (ATME), held in Svolvaer, Norway, in April 2010. The ATME made 30 recommendations. Subsequent ATCMs (ATCM XXXIII and ATCM XXXIV) have considered some of the recommendations of the ATME. In receiving the report of the ATME, ATCM XXXIII acknowledged that discussing all recommendations in detail would need to continue over a number of ATCMs. In response to a proposal by the UK and Norway, ATCM XXXIV tasked the Secretariat to record and report on action taken by the CEP and ATCM to address the recommendations of the ATME. 
The work plan is an appropriate mechanism to assist the ATCM to consider the outstanding ATME recommendations in a systematic way. Australia notes that 5 broad groups of recommendations can be readily identified: global outreach; energy management; risk assessment; improved understanding and prediction of climate change; and environmental protection. Scheduling ATCM discussions to consider one or more of these groups at a particular meeting would assist Parties and Observers to focus their efforts on the particular aspect(s) under consideration, and would be an efficient means of progressing consideration of the recommendations.
Priority: 
Action: Consider in detail the recommendations of the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Implications of Climate Change for Antarctic Management and Governance, including through allocation of recommendations to relevant ATCM and CEP agenda items.
