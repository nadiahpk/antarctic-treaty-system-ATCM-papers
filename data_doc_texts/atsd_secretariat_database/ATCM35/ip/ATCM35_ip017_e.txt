Search and Rescue Incidents in the 2011/12 Season: FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2 










Search and Rescue Incidents in the 2011/12 Season:
FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2 
1.0 	Introduction

This paper reports on two search and rescue incidents which occurred in the Ross Sea during the 2011/12 season, involving the Russian-flagged FV SPARTA and the Korean-flagged FV JEONG WOO 2 (aka JUNG WOO 2).  Both incidents required resource-intensive responses from the national programmes of New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and the United States of America; New Zealand government agencies; and non-governmental actors.   This Information Paper is intended to be read in conjunction with New Zealand’s Working Paper: ATCM Response to CCAMLR Fishing Vessel Incidents, which proposes ways in which the ATCM could support the effort of Parties with search and rescue coordination responsibility in the Antarctic Treaty area.   
2.0 	FV SPARTA Search and Rescue Incident
2.1 	Overview

Between 15 December 2011 and 9 January 2012, New Zealand’s Rescue Co-ordination Centre (RCCNZ) co-ordinated a search and rescue (SAR) operation in the Ross Sea for the Russian-flagged fishing vessel FV SPARTA, which was operating in the area of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Living Resources (CCAMLR).   The three week SAR response involved the national programmes of New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America, with assistance from a number of fishing vessels licensed to CCAMLR Members which were operating in the area (hereafter referred to as CCAMLR vessels).
2.2 	Timeline of Events

A detailed timeline of significant events is attached in Appendix 1.
2.3 	15 December 2011 UTC - the first 24 hours

    • At 14.11hrs UTC the long-line fishing vessel FV Sparta issued an Inmarsat Distress Alert to JRCC Stavanger, Norway that was relayed to RCCNZ.  The vessel was on the eastern edge of the Ross Sea, 130 nautical miles north of Cape Colbeck, 540 nautical miles east of Cape Bird, Ross Island, and 1900 nautical miles southeast of New Zealand.  The vessel master reported that it had suffered a hole in its hull, that it was in heavy ice, and that it was taking on water.  There were 32 people on board, of various nationalities.
    • RCCNZ received updated information through other fishing vessels operating in the vicinity and relayed via the Russian ship agent (based in the United States of America).    
    • A number of CCAMLR fishing vessels were identified within a 600 nautical mile radius of FV SPARTA but heavy ice conditions prevented these vessels from making any significant progress towards it.  
    • At 22:00hrs, a fly-over was undertaken by a United States Antarctic Programme’s LC130 aircraft at the request of RCCNZ.  This provided RCCNZ with the first on-scene appraisal of the situation.  Given the distance and heavy sea-ice separating FV SPARTA from assistance, it was assessed that the vessel itself provided the best means of rescue, by making its own repairs.  This required the delivery of pumps to lower the water level and supplies to enable repairs to the breach in the hull.  

2.4 	16 December 2011 

    • First Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) C130 air drop of equipment to FV SPARTA completed.
2.5 	17 December 2011 

    • In response to a government-to-government request from Russia to Korea, the Korean research vessel RV Araon was tasked to steam the 1900 nautical miles from its berth in Lyttelton, New Zealand, to assist FV SPARTA with its repairs and escort the vessel from the sea ice.  The superior icebreaking capability of the RV Araon made it the only vessel in the vicinity able to reach FV SPARTA.
2.6 	21 December 2011

    • Second airdrop of equipment to FV SPARTA completed.  A second air drop was required as specific details for supplies required to repair the hull were lacking at the time of the first air drop and it was discovered that the length of the original hose supplied with the pump could not reach the lower level of water.
2.7 	25 December 2011

    • RV ARAON rendez-vous with FV SPARTA.  Salvage assistance commenced.  
2.8 	27 December 2011

    • FV SPARTA led out of the ice field by RV ARAON. 
2.9 	29 December 2011

    • FV SPARTA released from escort by RV ARAON and continued passage to New Zealand.
2.10 	8 January 2012

    • FV SPARTA arrived in New Zealand.
2.11	SAR Resources

The total duration of the SAR response, from the initial alert on 15 December 2011 UTC to the safe arrival of the FV SPARTA for repairs at the port of Nelson, New Zealand on 8 January 2012, was 584 hours (24 days and 8 hours).  As noted above, significant resources were called upon to assist in the SAR response:

RV Araon (Korea): 274 hours (approximately 11.5 days)
FV Seljevaer (Norway): 135 hours (approximately 5.5 days)
FV San Aspiring (New Zealand): 35 hours
Royal New Zealand Air Force: approximately 40 flying hours 
United States Antarctic Programme: approximately 5 flying hours

New Zealand wishes to express sincere appreciation to all of the parties that contributed to the SAR response.
3.0 	FV JEONG WOO 2 Search and Rescue Incident
3.1 	Introduction
From 10 to 24 January 2012, RCCNZ coordinated a SAR operation in the Ross Sea for the Korean-flagged fishing vessel JEONG WOO 2, which was operating in the area under a CCAMLR fishing licence.  The SAR response involved significant resources provided by the national programmes of New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and the United States of America; other New Zealand government agencies; and a number of CCAMLR vessels operating in the area. 
3.2	Timeline of events

A detailed timeline of significant events is attached in Appendix 2.
3.2	10 January 2012 UTC – the first 12 hours

    • At 13.51hrs UTC the New Zealand-flagged fishing vessel Antarctic Chieftain notified RCCNZ of a radiotelephone distress relay from Korean-flagged FV Hong Jin 707 made on behalf of the Korean flagged fishing vessel Jeong Woo 2.   It was initially thought that the Hong Jin 707was the vessel in distress, but it was subsequently confirmed to be FV Jeong Woo 2.  (Note: Unfortunately, at no stage was an Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon or Inmarsat C Distress Alert received from the FV Jeong Woo 2. If such action been taken it would have identified the casualty vessel and eliminated the initial confusion over which vessel was on fire.) 
    • At the time of the distress relay, the JEONG WOO 2 was reported to be 300 nautical miles northeast of Cape Bird, Ross Island, and 1600 nautical miles south of New Zealand.  The vessel was reported to be on fire.  Forty people were reported on board, of which 25 had abandoned to a life raft and 15 had remained on board.  Of the 15, three persons were reported missing/presumed dead in the accommodation area of the vessel where the fire had started, three other persons had serious burns, and another three persons had moderate burns. 
    • 14:00 – 15:00hrs:  A number of fishing vessels were operating in the vicinity but heavy ice conditions prevented most of these vessels from responding.  Two sister ships of the Jeong Woo 2 were the closest to the scene and rendered assistance.  They were Jeong Woo 3 and Hong Jin 707.
    • The US research vessel, Nathaniel B Palmer, which had hospital facilities and two medics on board, responded to the SAR emergency and was tasked to uplift seven crew who required medical attention and deliver them to the US base at McMurdo Station (a 30 hour voyage). 
    • 15:24hrs:   Korean Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre confirmed the identity of the casualty vessel as the JEONG WOO 2 and subsequently confirmed to RCCNZ that the fire on JEONG WOO 2 was out of control.  
    • 16:23hrs: Korean research vessel RV ARAON responded to the SAR emergency and made its way to the scene. 
    • 19:15hrs: All of the survivors were successfully transferred from the JEONG WOO 2 onto sister vessel JEONG WOO 3. JEONG WOO 2 was reported to still be on fire.
3.4	11 January 2012

    • 05:47hrs - 15:00hrs NATHANIEL B PALMER arrived on the scene, evacuated the seven burn victims from jeong woo 3, and transported them to the McMurdo Sound ice edge.  
3.5	12 January 2012

    • 19:45hrs: Helicopter evacuation by the United States Antarctic Program to McMurdo Station completed.  Medical attention provided to seven burn victims.
    • 23:35hrs: A United States Air Force LC130 aircraft departed McMurdo for Christchurch with the seven burn victims for further medical attention.  It arrived in Christchurch on 13 January 2012 at 07:20hrs UTC.
3.6	19 January 2012 

    • Korean research vessel RV ARAON rendez-vous with JEONG WOO 3.  The remaining 30 crew of the JEONG WOO 2 were transferred to the RV ARAON.  When the JEONG WOO 2 was last sighted it was still afloat and smoke was still evident.
3.7	24 January 2012

    • RV Araon arrived in New Zealand.  Remaining crew disembarked.  
3.8	SAR Resources 

The total duration of the SAR response was 356 hours (15 days):

    • 67 hours from initial alert to arrival of the burn victims in Christchurch hospital, and
    • 289 hours (12 days) to disembark the remaining survivors in Lyttelton.

As noted above, significant resources were called upon to assist in the SAR response: 

RV Araon: 342 hours (14 days 6 hours)
FV Hong Jin 707: approximately 226 hours (9.5 days)
FV Jeong Woo 3: approximately 226 hours (9.5 days)
RV Nathaniel B Palmer: 53.5 hours 
FV Argos Georgia: 29 hours
United States Antarctic Programme helicopter and LC-130 evacuation:  over 8 flying hours

New Zealand wishes to express sincere appreciation to all parties involved in the SAR response.
