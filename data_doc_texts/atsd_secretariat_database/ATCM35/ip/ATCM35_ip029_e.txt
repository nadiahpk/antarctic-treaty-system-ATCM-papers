Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (updated 2012)








       Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (updated 2012)
An information paper submitted by the United Kingdom

    1. In 2010 and 2011 Information Papers were submitted to the CEP detailing the colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (ATCM XXXIII IP42; ATCM XXXIV IP50)
    2. In the last year, there have been: 
    • developments in the colonisation status of some of the non-native species described previously and 
    • non-native species reported at new locations.  
    3. Information relating to these developments has been added to the information presented last year and is shown in Table 1 (in bold).  Information has also been added concerning earlier records of non-native species that were not included previously (not in bold) 
    4. To the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made to eradicate any of the known non-native species in the past year.
