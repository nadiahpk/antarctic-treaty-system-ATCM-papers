Areas of tourist interest in the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region. 2011/2012 austral summer season
Summary
This paper presents a report on the distribution of tourist visits to the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region according to the voyages made by vessels during the 2011/2012 summer season, operating through the port of Ushuaia.
Introduction
Although Antarctica has consolidated as a tourist destination, it is appropriate to emphasize that most programs mainly market the Antarctic Peninsula. In this respect and taking into account that over 90% of the Antarctic shipborne tourist flow operates through the port of Ushuaia, this analysis focuses exclusively on that region.
The Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) are considered as one single region, identifying in turn different areas of tourist interest. To this end, work has been undertaken on the basis of information provided by tour operators in their cruise ship manifests to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority), during the 2010/2011 season. In some cases, the information from these documents was completed with the itineraries published by tour operators.
During the analyzed season a total of 183 voyages were made to the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region through the port of Ushuaia, run by 25 vessels. Of this total, 149 manifests have informed of the voyage plan1, that is to say, 81% of the itineraries planned by tour operators are available when vessels set sail. 
Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region and its areas of tourist interest
The Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) are defined as a region from the point of view of tourist visits, acknowledging in turn different areas on the basis of criteria such as geographical proximity and concentration of points of interest. The resulting areas are presented below (See Table 1). 
    1) Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands). 
    2) Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands.
    3) Islas Shetland del Sur (South Shetland Islands).
    4) Northeast of Antarctic Peninsula.
       (Space between Gourdin Islands and Cerro Nevado Island (Snow Hill Island), including Antarctic Strait (Antarctic Sound) and Weddell Sea towards the East).
    5) Northwest of Antarctic Peninsula.
(West coast of the Peninsula, along with de la Flota Sea (Bransfield Strait), between Gourdin Island and Mikkelsen Harbour).
    6) Central-West Antarctic Peninsula.
(Between Mikkelsen Harbour and Almirante Brown Station, practically including Palmer Archipelago, with De Gerlache Strait (Gerlache Strait)). 
    7) Southwest of Antarctic Peninsula. 
(Comprising the areas adjacent to Lemaire Channel and to Penola Strait, between Flandes Bay (Flandres Bay) and Beascochea Bay, area of Bellingshausen Sea).
    8) Antarctic Polar Circle
(Spaces close to the parallel defining the Circle are considered, approximately from 66º 00’ S to 68º 11’ S, that is to say, between Prospección Point (Prospect Point) and Stonington Island, respectively).

Distribution of visits to different tourist sites according to voyage plans
Taking into account the voyage plan for each vessel at the time of departing, it is found that the most visited areas in the region are the Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and the Central-West Peninsula area, concentrating, in both cases, 95% of voyages; followed by the Southwest of the Peninsula area with 74% and the Northeast of the Peninsula area with 44%. The least frequented areas are Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands, the Northwest of the Peninsula, Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), and Antarctic Polar Circle (See Figure 1).
In addition, within each area it is possible to identify the sites most frequently visited. In this regard, a figure is shown for each area highlighting the sites according to the number of voyages made to that place (See Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). It is worth mentioning that a total of 84 sites were identified for visits during this season.

Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) area
For Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), it is found that Orcadas Station at Laurie Island has been the most visited site, followed by Ripio Cove (Shingle Cove) and lastly, Signy Station. Nevertheless, 12 voyages were made to this area without detailing the site to visit (See Figure 2). The inclusion of this area on the itineraries is related to voyages that, in general, visit other destinations located further North on the Atlantic Ocean and then go around Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and Northeast of Antarctic Peninsula areas, also visiting the Central-West area (See Table 2). This area has 1 site with Site Guidelines for Visitors: Ripio Cove (Shingle Cove).

The most prominent visit site on this area is Wild Cape (Wild Point), mentioned on 17 voyage plans, whereas Vigilante Cape (Lookout Cape) was only mentioned for 2 voyages. Nevertheless, 5 voyage plans referred to Elefante Island (Elephant Island) without mentioning specific visit sites (See Figure 3). As it can be seen from Table 3, most voyages to this area were related to Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Central-West and Northeast Peninsula. This area does not have any Site Guidelines for Visitors.

Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) area
Together with the Central West area, it is the most frequently visited area with several visit sites totaling 21, as clearly shown by Figure 4; Balleneros Cove (Whalers Bay) at Decepción Island (Deception Island) was mentioned on 87 voyage plans, reaching the highest number for this area. Media Luna Island (Half Moon Island) and Aitcho Islets are next in the visiting order. For 25 de Mayo Island (King George Island) and Decepción Island (Deception Island), although the visit sites mentioned are diverse, the islands were also considered without specifying particular visit sites; this is also the case with Livingston Island and Shetland del Sur (South Shetland) Archipelago, and they are therefore also considered in the Figure. This area is closely linked to all others, revealing that one of its visit sites is included almost on every voyage (See Table 4). Out of all the sites which were identified, 9 have Site Guidelines for Visitors: Turret Point, Pingüino Island (Penguin Island), Aitcho Islets, Yankee Harbour, Media Luna Island (Half Moon Island), Hannah Point, Telefon Bay, Balleneros Cove (Whalers Bay) and Rancho Point (Bailey Head), being coincident with the most visited ones.

Northeast area presents 12 points of interest, being Bardas Coloradas Mount (Brown Bluff) the most frequently visited with 61 voyages, followed by Paulet Island with 38. Del Diablo Island (Devil Island) and Kinnes Cape are other significant points; likewise, Weddell Sea was mentioned without specifying a particular visit site (See Figure 5). The areas showing a strong correspondence with this one are Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and Central-West Peninsula (See Table 5). There are 4 sites with Site Guidelines for Visitors: Bardas Coloradas Mount (Brown Bluff), Paulet Island, Del Diablo Island (Devil Island) and Cerro Nevado Island (Snow Hill Island), being coincident with the most visited ones.

Northwest of Antarctic Peninsula area
The Northwest of the Peninsula is the least frequently visited area, presenting only three visit sites, Astrolabe Island, Christiania Island and Mikkelsen Harbour, the first and second receiving visits from 4 voyages and the third one from 15 (See Figure 6). Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that visits to Mikkelsen Harbour are generally associated with Cierva Cove and Hydrurga Rocks which, for the purposes of this report, are part of Central-West Peninsula area. Due to the low frequency registered by this area, it is only associated more significantly with voyages to the Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Central-West and Southwest of Antarctic Peninsula areas (See Table 6). This area does not have any Site Guidelines for Visitors.

Central-West Antarctic Peninsula area
Together with the Shetland Islands (South Shetland Islands), it is the most visited area and it has the most frequently visited sites, 115 voyages for Neko Harbour. Also, it contains the highest number of sites mentioned on voyage plans for tourist visits, totaling 26 sites. The second most visited site in this area is Cuverville Island, with 95 voyages, followed by Goudier Island/Lockroy Port, Jougla Point, with 94 voyages. Other site with a significant number of visits is Almirante Brown Station, Skontorp Cove (See Figure 7). Likewise, this area is strongly associated with the other visit areas (See Table 7). Out of all the sites which were identified, just 6 have Site Guidelines for Visitors: Cuverville Island, Dedo Island (Danco Island), Neko Harbour, Goudier Island/Lockroy Port, Jougla Point and Damoy Point, being coincident with the most visited ones.

Over the last years vessels sail further South, including spaces near the Antarctic Polar Circle. In this respect, for the analyzed season, 9 tourist visit sites were identified as mentioned on voyage plans. Of this total amount, 11 belong to the Garganta Channel (The Gullet) with the highest frequency, followed by Detaille and Stonington Islands (See Figure 9). Its association with other visit areas is more significant in the case of most frequently visited areas, that is, with Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Central-West and Southwest Antarctic Peninsula (See Table 9). This area has 3 sites with Site Guidelines for Visitors: Detaille Island, Herradura Island (Horseshoe Island) and Stonington Island, being coincident with the most visited ones.

Final considerations
From the analysis of voyage plans presented by tour operators for 2011/2012 season, 8 tourist visit areas were identified at the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region. Of these areas, the most frequented are, Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and Central-West, followed by the Southwest Peninsula area. Central-West area contains the visit sites with most voyages (Neko Harbour, Cuverville Island and Goudier Island/Port Lockroy, Jougla Point), Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) being next with the fourth most visited site (Balleneros Cove (Whalers Bay)). Likewise, Southwest area contains two important visit sites, Petermann Island and Pléneau Island, in the vicinity of Lemaire Channel. These 3 areas are, in turn, closely associated among them in connection with voyages combining these spaces. 
On the other hand, the Northeast of the Peninsula area also includes a significant percentage of voyages, associated preferably with areas located to the North of the Peninsula, such as Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands. The Northwest of the Peninsula, Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands and Antarctic Circle areas were the least visited by tourist voyages. 
Finally, except for two areas (Elefante -Elephant- Island and adjacent islands and the Northwest Antarctic Peninsula), the other areas have Site Guidelines for Visitors for the most frequented places.
