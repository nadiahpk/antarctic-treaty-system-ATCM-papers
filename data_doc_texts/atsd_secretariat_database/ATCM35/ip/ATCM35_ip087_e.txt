Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia. Comparison of the last four Austral summer seasons








Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia. Comparison of the last four Austral summer seasons
Summary
According to the data in IP 119 (2009)1, IP 129 (2010)2, IP 20 (2011)3 and IP 88 (2012)4, comparisons on tourist flows that visited Antarctica through Ushuaia, from summer season 2008/2009 to the last, 2011/2012, are presented. In this respect, information about number of passengers, vessels, registers and tour operators is given.
With regard to the number of passengers who visited Antarctica
Out of the four seasons being compared, the numbers of passengers to Antarctica hardly show variations among the first three periods, being quite significant the decrease of passengers for the last season. The 2009/2010 season presents a minor decrease with respect to the previous one (about 6%), but in the following season there is an increase of 0,38%. On the contrary, the last season shows that the number of passengers dropped 32% if compared to the first period taken into account in this paper, 2008/2009 (See Figure 1).

However, the most significant difference appears in the ratio between the number of visitors aboard vessels that carried more than 500 passengers, and those that carried up to 500. On one hand, when comparing seasons 2008/2009 to 2010/2011, the former category (vessels that carried more than 500 passengers) has increased the total number of passengers, to notably decrease in the last period. In this regard, there has been a reduction of 75% of visitors when comparing the two last seasons 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 (See Figure 2). Basically, this reduction is due to vessels that stopped operating since they were affected by the amendments to Annex 1, MARPOL (IMO) which entered into force in August 2011, that ban heavy fuel in Antarctica.
On the other hand, the latter category (those vessels that carried up to 500 passengers) shows more moderate fluctuations, with a gradual decrease between the following seasons: 2008/2009 - 2009/2010 (- 15%) and 2009/2010 - 2010/2011 (- 14%), meanwhile, the last season presents an increase of 8% with respect to the previous one (See Figure 2).

With regard to the number of vessels that traveled to Antarctica
Besides, it can also be noted that the number of vessels which operated in Antarctica has decreased throughout these four seasons in a 30%5, passing from 36 in 2008/2009 to 25 in 2011/2012. Vessels which carried up to 500 passengers showed a similar behaviour. Nevertheless, the ones that carried more than 500 passengers increased during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons, to finally decrease in the last period. (See Table 1 and Figure 3).

With regard to the registers of vessels
Most of the vessels that operated during these four seasons were registered in countries which are not Antarctic Treaty Parties (See Figure 4).
In this regard, out of the total of vessels that operated Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia during the 2008/2009 season, the participation of registers that belong to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties was of a 39%. For the following season the percentage increased to 43% and then it went down to 38%; finally it reached a 44% in the last season (2011/2012). Vessels registered in the Russian Federation had a meaningful participation in the first two seasons of analysis; meanwhile vessels registered in the Netherlands have increased gradually. Besides, a vessel registered in Norway has maintained its participation and registers in France increased in one vessel for the last season (See Table 2).
With regard to registers of vessels that do not belong to an Antarctic Treaty Party, Bahamas shows more representation even though it has fallen according to the decrease of the total amount of vessels by the end of these four seasons. Likewise, a total of 13 registers belonging to Non-Treaty Parties have been identified for the whole period of analysis (2008/2009 to 2011/2012) (See Table 2).

With regard to tour operators 
Tour operators have shown a decrease of 26% with regard to their participation in Antarctic tourism operations6 through Ushuaia between the first and last season under analysis (See Figure 5). In turn, companies located in countries which are Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties had a decrease of 40% (from 27 to 19 companies), meanwhile, those located in a country which is not a Consultative Party (Canada) also presented a minor decrease (from 4 to 3).
