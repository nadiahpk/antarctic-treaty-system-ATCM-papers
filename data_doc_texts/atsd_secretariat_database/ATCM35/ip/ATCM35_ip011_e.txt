Topic Summary: The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Abstract
Australia provides a summary, based on meeting reports, of previous discussions by the Parties on the development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Plan) for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM). This paper is intended to assist the ATCM in its discussion under agenda item 7 and the proposal in WP 30 The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. 
Background	
At ATCM XXXI in Kyiv (2008) the United States presented Working Paper 48 The Antarctic Treaty at Fifty Years: Planning for Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXXII (Baltimore, 2009). An attachment to the paper titled ATCM XXXII: Possible Themes for a Long-Term Agenda outlined themes identified for consideration in the context of a long-term agenda for the ATCM. The Meeting agreed with the proposal by the United States to hold a discussion at ATCM XXXII about developing such a long-term agenda.
At ATCM XXXII in Baltimore (2009), under the special agenda item relating to the 50th Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, the Parties discussed a strategic planning approach to the work of the ATCM.  The discussion included consideration of ways that the ATCM operates, as well as issues that might be considered by the ATCM in a more strategic way. The meeting considered the attachment to ATCM XXXIII/WP48, and also Working Paper 46 by the Russian Federation On the strategic role of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 in the process of international relations in the South Polar region of the earth. 
The meeting report reflects the support expressed for a strategic planning approach to allow ATCMs to more effectively address priority issues, in a five to ten year time frame, and that this could take the form of a multi-year work plan (ATCM XXXII final report, para. 322). The meeting also agreed that “the development and use of a multi-year strategic work plan, as done by the CEP, would help the Treaty Parties anticipate and structure both ATCMs and intersessional work to better address issues of priority and timely importance.” 
The meeting discussed issues that might be considered in the context of a strategic work plan, and also ways that the operation of ATCMs might be improved. The meeting noted that the list of issues discussed was not exhaustive, and that other issues might be considered in developing a work plan. ‘Development of a Multi-year strategic work plan’ was added to the draft agenda for ATCM XXXIII (2010). Paragraphs 321 to 329 of the ATCM XXXII final report apply.
At ATCM XXXIII in Punta del Este, the Parties focussed on a proposal to shorten the length of the ATCM. There was no detailed discussion of the topics that might be included on a strategic work plan. The agenda item ‘Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan’ was retained in adopting the draft agenda for ATCM XXXIV.
At ATCM XXXIV in Buenos Aires (2011) many Parties provided views on both issues that might be included on a strategic work plan, and institutional arrangements for the ATCM. Paragraphs 427 to 442 of the final report detail these discussions. 
The outcomes of discussions on a Plan across these meetings are summarised below in two tables – one dealing with issues that might be included in a Plan, and another listing matters relating to the institutional and organisational aspects of the ATCM. Comments made by Parties relating specifically to the characteristics and use of a strategic plan are not included.  Instead, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States have sought to take these comments into account in the proposal presented in WP 30 The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  
Issues identified for consideration in a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan
ATCM XXXII Baltimore:
    • climate change
    • science
    • ecosystems
    • marine protected areas
    • promotion of the use of renewable energy
    • biological prospecting
    • cooperation and coordination with other international bodies and agreements
    • implementation of and compliance with the obligations of the Treaty and measures adopted thereunder
    • liability (implementation of Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection and addressing issues beyond response action)
    • shipping and aviation
    • tourism 
    • noting, reviewing or addressing as appropriate international developments, including treaties and or other international instruments, which may be of relevance to the Antarctic Treaty system
    • providing input from the ATCMs to other forums addressing important issues of relevance to the Antarctic region
    • expanding outreach programmes to make the general public and other international bodies aware of the unique features of Antarctica and the Antarctic Treaty system
    • coordination by ATCPs of their activities in those other forums in pursuing common objectives
ATCM XXXIV Buenos Aires:
    • climate change
    • renewable energy
    • bioprospecting
    • continuing importance of Protocol
    • scientific cooperation
    • development of a joint monitoring and compliance mechanism
    • marine protected areas
    • interface between CCAMLR and ATCM on marine protected areas
    • role of scientific research
    • challenges associated with increase of human activities in Antarctica
    • a vision defined by the principles of the Treaty and the Protocol 
    • working more closely with other international organisations and national governments
    • better use of Electronic Information Exchange System
    • collective work and outreach
Comments on the institutional practices of the ATCM 
ATCM XXXII Baltimore:
    • developing more issue-specific, targeted agendas for ATCMs
    • revising the frequency and / or duration of ATCMs
    • making better use of meetings of experts, workshops (such as the Joint CEP / SC-CCAMLR Workshop), and intersessional work to prepare for ATCMs
    • use of joint meetings or workshops with other international bodies, both within and outside the Antarctic Treaty system
ATCM XXXIV Buenos Aires:
    • discussions should be supported by proposals that have a clarity of purpose and are considered
    • involve experts and professionals in dealing with specific issues
    • policy development should be based on data and science, for example by drawing on the advice of the CEP under each relevant agenda item, rather than just taking whole CEP report in one session.
    • intersessional work should be better utilised, and broad participation is important.
    • intersessional and expert meetings should take place electronically
    • frequent re-evaluation of agenda to respond to new and emerging issues.
    • identifying a theme or priority issues for each ATCM, or for a particular day, for detailed consideration
    • consensus is required to agree on issues for discussion or on themes for meetings
    • an agreed document containing outcomes could be developed for action by ATCM and better links with international community
    • translate main results of ongoing scientific research into action and communicate these results and outcomes to the public
    • enhance the efficiency of meetings
    • Working Papers should frame and stimulate debate rather than be informative, and should propose decisions or resolutions
    • ATCM could benefit from greater use of competencies of SCAR and COMNAP
    • avoiding duplication of work carried out in other fora
Observations
Discussions on a Plan have been supportive of the concept, and a range of issues have been raised that might be considered in such a Plan. The use and basic framework of such a Plan has been canvassed in these discussions. 
In Australia’s view, the summary above demonstrates that there have been two main aspects to the discussions to date: priority issues that the ATCM should address, and which could be included in a Plan; and options for improving the mechanisms, institutional arrangements, and practices of the ATCM. Australia suggests that the former category should be the primary focus of initial discussions about the Plan at ATCM XXXV.  These priority issues will then assist in shaping the agenda and institutional arrangements of the ATCM.  Actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ATCM would be welcomed and consideration of such matters may be identified in the Plan as a priority for attention.
Many of the issues identified for inclusion in a Plan have, to date, been relatively general and high-level in nature. In developing a Plan to guide the work of the ATCM it remains necessary to consider in greater detail the specific matters to be considered, their relative priorities, and the actions to be taken.
