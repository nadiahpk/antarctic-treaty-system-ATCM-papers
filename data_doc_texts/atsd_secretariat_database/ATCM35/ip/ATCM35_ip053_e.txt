Follow-up to Vessel Incidents in Antarctic Waters






Antarctic Treaty System Follow-up 
to Vessel Incidents in Antarctic Waters
Information Paper submitted by ASOC1
Abstract
This information paper undertakes a preliminary assessment of reporting following a vessel incident. It considers the comprehensiveness of reporting on the incident and any subsequent investigation into the cause of the incident. It also addresses reporting of the extent and impact of pollution arising from an incident, and the implementation of lessons learned or recommendations arising from an incident via the initial response, environmental monitoring or subsequent investigation. It identifies a number of shortcomings in the current system and recommends that the ATCM and CCAMLR address these as a matter of urgency. 

Introduction
In the past decade a significant number of vessel incidents have focused attention on operations in Antarctic waters. One outcome was the introduction of a ban on the use and carriage of heavy fuel oils by vessels operating south of 60 degrees South. Another is the ongoing development of a mandatory Polar Code. ASOC has previously raised (see ATCM32_IP034 and DE 53/18/3) the importance of ensuring that lessons are learned from each incident and used to inform the development of the Polar Code. It is also important to ensure that the recommendations arising from investigations are followed through and fully implemented. 

Investigations should be thorough in terms of the incident and the factors leading to the incident, and should also address the full consequence of the incident, including pollution occurring as a result of the incident (either known or the potential for pollution). Where appropriate, monitoring should be undertaken to assess the impact on the environment.

Recent incidents in Europe, for example the grounding of the oil tanker Sea Empress in West Wales in 1996, the structural failure of the oil tanker Erika off the west coast of France in 1999, the sinking of the passenger ferry MS Estonia in the Baltic in 1994, and the structural failure of the container vessel MSC Napoli in the English Channel in 2007, have resulted in a number of inquiries and reports, leading to significant changes in operations and regulations at the national and regional levels. Following the grounding and oil spill from the Sea Empress the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) prepared a report into the grounding and subsequent salvage, and an environmental evaluation committee prepared a report on the environmental impacts of the oil spill (MAIB, 1997; SEEEC, 1998). Subsequently a review of the power of State intervention and the command and control of salvage was also conducted by Lord Donaldson (Donaldson, J.F., 1999) leading to 26 recommendations relating to intervention, compensation, liability, command and control. Following the capsizing of the MS Estonia with the loss of 852 lives in the Baltic in 1994, a number of reports into the disaster were published, including the report of a Joint Accident Investigation Commission (JAIB, 1997) and independent investigation by German experts (Holtappels & Hummel, 1999), followed by the European Commission publishing a new set of proposed measures aimed at improving passenger ship safety in 2001. In response to the structural failure of the container vessel MSC Napoli, the MAIB published a report on the structural failure (MAIB, 2008), while various government departments, agencies and research bodies were involved in post-incident monitoring of the impact (Cefas, 2007). While following a series of large oil spills in European waters, but largely in response to the Erika oil spill, the European Commission produced three packages of measures aimed at improving shipping safety and reducing environmental damage2. 

While recognizing that to date incidents in Antarctic waters have not been on the same scale and that based on current shipping patterns a large-scale spill of cargo oil or containers is not a possibility, ASOC suggests that Antarctic parties can learn from these incidents, and should review the adequacy of:
 
    • response to incidents, 
    • pollution monitoring arising as a result of an incident and pollution impacts, 
    • investigations of incidents, and 
    • implementation of recommendations from incidents. 

Recent incidents involving vessels in Antarctic waters
Table 1 (Annex 1) provides a list of incidents that have occurred in the past 6 years in Antarctic waters involving a range of vessels including cruise ships, fishing vessels and yachts. It identifies the nature of the incident and, where it is known, if pollution occurred as a result of the incident. Several of these have resulted in loss of life, while others could easily have done so. 

Reporting on incidents – response, monitoring, investigation and implementation
Although the responsibility for incident response, monitoring of pollution, investigation into an incident and the delivery of recommendations arising from the investigation lies primarily with the Flag States, Antarctic Treaty Parties (ATPs) also have responsibilities placed on them by the Environmental Protocol to report to the ATCM following an incident, including on emergency response action and on the outcome of monitoring to assess the extent and impact of pollution. Based on the Protocol’s environmental principles (Article 3) and requirements for cooperation (Article 6), compliance and notification (Article 13), emergency response action (Article 15) and annual reporting (Article 17), ASOC submits that ATPs should be reporting to the ATCM on all aspects of a vessel incident – the initial incident and consequences, extent and impact of associated pollution (when pollution results), monitoring programmes established to determine the impact of pollution, investigations into the incident and subsequent efforts to implement recommendations arising from investigations.3 The ATCM should consider the reports and determine if any further action is necessary. 

ASOC has analyzed the follow-up to a number of recent incidents, focusing in particular on reporting on the incident, environmental response and monitoring of impact, subsequent investigation, and implementation of recommendations arising from the investigation (See Annex 1, Table 2). 

Of the submissions analysed a number reported on the response to the incidents. For example XXX ATCM IP 40 submitted by New Zealand in response to the fire on board the Japanese Whaling Vessel Nisshin Maru, XXXI ATCM IP121 on the Fram incident and XXXIV ATCM IP59 on the grounding of the Polar Star both submitted by Norway. Very few, however, reported on an investigation into the cause of the incident and provided information on recommendations resulting from an investigation. A notable exception was a paper submitted by Belgium, which was neither the flag state nor the permitting / licensing state, on the report by the Liberian flag on the sinking of MS Explorer (XXXII ATCM IP120). This report is the official investigation into the sinking of the Explorer from the Liberian Commissioner of Maritime Affairs and includes eleven recommendations covering:

    • competency training, 
    • carriage of immersion suits for all passengers and crew, 
    • partially enclosed lifeboats, 
    • documentation and training of expedition staff as vessel crew, 
    • revision of procedures with respect to gauging records, 
    • minimum requirements for deck and shell plating thickness for all ice class vessels, and survey procedures,
    • abandon ship procedures, 
    • crowd control procedures, 
    • drilling and training in lifeboat engines, 
    • procedures for emergency briefings, and 
    • development of crisis management plans.

There has not been a report updating the ATCM on progress in implementing these recommendations. 

Another notable report was submitted by Norway, the flag state, following the M/S Nordkapp incident (XXX ATCM WP37 rev. 1). The report covers both the incident and the spill of diesel, the only report to address the response to and impact of pollution arising from the incident. It highlights a number of issues that “will require further evaluation and consideration in the months and years to come”, including the need to:

    • consider what types of equipment are appropriate for handling different types of fuel spills in Antarctica,
    • consider whether there is a need to strengthen legal requirements relating to the use of response equipment and competency in using it,
    • continue to address the HFO issue,
    • consider and discuss advantages to developing a common incident response strategy framework within the ATS,
    • consider and discuss advantages in developing a common incident response strategy framework within the ATS, and 
    • consider and discuss advantages of developing a common incident information exchange strategy framework within the ATS.

Again there has not been a report updating the ATCM on progress in implementing these recommendations. 

ATCM XXXI IP52 reporting into the main engine failure of FV Argos Georgia in the Ross Sea on 24 December 2007 by the United Kingdom and XXX CCAMLR BG 34 following-up on information regarding the capsize and loss of the Insung No.1 by Korea both address incidents relating to fishing vessels and both make a number of lessons and / or recommendations including:

    • the need for contingency planning in respect of mechanical spares, provisions, 
    • risk assessment in relation to pairing / buddying of vessels or operating a vessel on its own, 
    • the need to be fully prepared for harsh weather and all shutters on the sides of vessels to be closed when not operating,  
    • the need for safety-related materials to be available in languages that all crew members can understand, 
    • proper emergency training to be provided to all crew, and 
    • the need for rescuing people in the water to take priority over those on boats.

In reviewing the United States’ Report on Inspections undertaken in 2006, it was noted that the Captain of the M/S Explorer had informed the Inspection Team that a seam in the forepeak of the vessel had been opened following a big growler strike during the previous season’s passage through the Lemaire Channel. The strike caused damage and a leak resulted from a ballast tank. The ship was subsequently repaired in Ushuaia (US Department of State, 2006). 
Concluding remarks
From a preliminary assessment, it is apparent that for a considerable number of the incidents that have occurred in the past six years, there has not been a report submitted to either the ATCM or CCAMLR on the incident. Of the papers that have been submitted, very few reported on the cause of the incident and the findings of any investigation carried out. In only one case was there any attempt to report on pollution that occurred during the course of the incident, although pollution is likely to have resulted from at least 6 or 7 of the incidents. In addition, it appears that there has been no monitoring of impact of pollution in the vast majority of cases where it occurred. Finally, when an incident has been reported to the ATCM and / or CCAMLR, there has been no reported follow up on the implementation of the recommendations arising. This preliminary assessment indicates that there are a number of gaps in the reporting effort. 

As a result, at ATCM XXXV ASOC calls on Antarctic Treaty Parties to adopt a Resolution addressing the need to:

    • remind ATPs and flag states of the importance of reporting on incidents, environmental monitoring and investigation, so that the full impacts can be assessed and so that lessons can be learnt and applied, 
    • reiterate the importance of thorough investigation of incidents, so that lessons can be identified, 
    • review environmental response to vessel incidents, and 
    • require follow-up reports to review progress on delivery and implementation of recommendations to be submitted to ATCM, and when appropriate to CCAMLR.
