Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2011-12

Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and IAATO

Summary

This Information Paper provides an update on data contained in ATCMXXXIV/WP20, presented by the United Kingdom, in conjunction with IAATO, with the aim of continuing to share information with other Treaty Parties about the number of yachts operating in the Antarctic during the past (2011-12) season.  The data is derived from sightings made by the British team at Port Lockroy, Antarctic Peninsula, and supplemented by additional sightings recorded by IAATO members in the Treaty area. 


Background

ATCM XXXIV noted the continuing interest in, and concern about, the conduct of some yachts in Antarctica (ATCMXXXIV Final Report, paras 278-297).   Many Parties welcomed the information provided by the UK, in conjunction with IAATO, about sighted yacht activities during 2010/11 (ATCM XXXV/WP20) and so this Information Paper provides the same information for the past season.  

Following comments made at ATCM XXXIV, however, we have also included as much information as we can about the registration details of the yachts sighted, as well as information about the authorising Party, where this has been determined. We would welcome any supplementary material which adds to or verifies this information.

As last year, the information from Port Lockroy is collected as part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and vessels).  The information from IAATO members is from other incidental sightings by their members. 

Compared to last year, the overall number of yachts sighted was down, from 50 in 2010/11 (of which 17 were IAATO members, and 33 were not), to 37 in 2011/12 (of which 14 were IAATO members and 23 were not). Eight vessels were either unauthorised or their authorisation status is unknown.


Recommendation

Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom and IAATO continue to believe that it is important that the ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting activities in Antarctica, taking particular note to identify any yachts that may have been in the region without authorisation from a Treaty Party.  

For that reason, we would continue to invite the ATCM to encourage Parties to continue to share information, including for example via the EIES Pre-Season Information facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with Resolution 5(2005), particularly for any non-IAATO yachts they have authorised (cf. ATCM XXXIV Final Report para 287), in order to increase the level of coordination between Parties about yacht activity in Antarctica.
