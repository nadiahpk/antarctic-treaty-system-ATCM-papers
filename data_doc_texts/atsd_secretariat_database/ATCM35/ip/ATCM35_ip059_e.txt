Review of the Implementation of the Madrid Protocol: Inspections by Parties (Article 14)
Information Paper submitted by UNEP and ASOC1
Summary
This Information Paper reviews the practice of inspections undertaken by Parties carried out under Article 14 of the Madrid Protocol. 
    1. Introduction 
Over the last two decades, the deliberations of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings have increasingly focused on the protection of the Antarctic environment. 
Through the Protocol of Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol), the Parties committed themselves to the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and designated Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science.  The Protocol entered into force on 14 January 1998 following the deposit of instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession by all the states which were Consultative Parties on 4 October 1991 when the Protocol was signed.  The Committee for Environmental Protection was established the same year in accordance with Article 11 of the Protocol.
The success of the Antarctic Treaty in protecting the Antarctic environment hinges, inter alia, on the compliance of by Parties, both individually and collectively, with its environmental obligations, in particular the implementation of the Madrid Protocol.
In order to assist Parties in furthering the protection of the Antarctic environment, in 2011 UNEP and ASOC initiated a review of the implementation of the Madrid Protocol.  As a first step of this review process,  UNEP and ASOC presented an Information Paper (XXXIV ATCM/IP 113) on the annual reporting duty set out in Article 17 of the Madrid Protocol in 2011. 
This year, UNEP and ASOC are pleased to present an analysis of the inspections by Parties in accordance with Article 14 of the Madrid Protocol.  Usually, inspections are conducted to verify compliance with both the Protocol and with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty.  This document, therefore, reviews the inspection practice undertaken under both instruments.
    2. Overview of the inspection practice
The inspection practice is a core component of the Antarctic Treaty and its Madrid Protocol. The practice is established under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty in order to “promote the objective and ensure the observance of the provisions of the […] Treaty” and under Article 14 of the Madrid Protocol in order to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, and to ensure compliance with [the] Protocol”.  
In order to guide observers conducting inspections in Antarctica in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 the Madrid Protocol, inspection checklists were adopted by Resolution 5 (1995).  A revised check list “A” pertaining to Antarctic Stations and Subsidiary Installations was adopted by Resolution 3 (2010).  There are currently checklists for Antarctic stations and subsidiary installations (Checklist A); vessels within the Antarctic Treaty Area (Checklist B); abandoned Antarctic stations and associated installations (Checklist C); waste disposal sites (Checklist D).  In addition, there is a checklist to assist in the inspection of ASPAs and ASMAs.  The development of a checklist for tourism has recently been discussed. 
In XXVI ATCM/ IP 118 rev.1, ASOC and UNEP reviewed the inspections carried out under the Treaty and the Protocol between 1959 and 2001.  The review noted that:
     There was an increase in official inspections and inspected facilities and sites during the 1959-2001 period;
     The majority of the inspected facilities or sites were located in the Antarctic Peninsula (48.3 %), followed by East Antarctica (12.1 %), Queen Maud Land (9.1 %) and the Ross Sea (7.9 %);
     Sixteen of the 27 Consultative Parties had conducted one or more inspections between 1959 and 2001;
     Of the 73 stations that were on the COMNAP’s list at the time, and that were located within the Antarctic Treaty Area, 51 (70%) had been inspected and thus 22 (30%) had never been inspected; 
     Ten vessels were inspected in the 1959-2001 period, of which six were inspected after October 1991, and three after January 1998;  
     The inspection of commercial tourism activities had been limited to the inspection of tourist vessels;
     All Parties other than  Sweden had had at least one of their sites or facilities inspected;  
     The Parties that had most sites or facilities inspected were Argentina, Russia, United Kingdom, USA and Chile.  
    3. Methods and data sources

A) List of inspections 

The analysis of inspections carried out since the entry into force of the Madrid Protocol is based on the inspections report available on the Secretariat website (Home > Antarctic Treaty > Peaceful use and Inspections > List of Inspections). 
Since the entry into force of the Protocol, 14 inspection reports have been submitted to the ATCM. 


B) List of facilities and sites 

The list of facilities, Historic Sites and Monuments (HSM), Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMA) used for the purpose of this paper derived from lists posted on the website of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) and the Secretariat (accessed April 2012).

COMNAP has posted on its web site a list of Antarctic Facilities at the following URL: https://www.comnap.aq/Members/Shared%20Documents/Antarctic_Facilities_List_1April2012.xls. It should be noted that different Parties use different criteria to list their facilities – for some Parties the listing is comprehensive while for others it includes only active stations but not abandoned stations or other facilities.

The lists of HSMs, ASPAs and ASMAs are posted on the Secretariat website (Home > Environment Protocol > Protected Areas > APA Database).

In addition, there are a number of other sites, some of which have been inspected on an ad hoc basis.  These include temporary sites such as field camps; sites used for tourism purposes; and a limited number of NGO sites.  There is no comprehensive list of these sites.  More than 250 sites were used for tourism purposes between 1989–90 and 2007–08.2  At present, thirty two sites regularly used for tourism landings are subject to site specific guidelines that are listed on the Secretariat website at the following URL: http://www.ats.aq/e/ats_other_siteguidelines.htm

Resupply and tourism vessels, including both motor vessels and some yachts, have also been inspected.  However, there is no complete list of the vessels operating in Antarctica currently available.
    4. Summary findings

    5. Analysis
As noted in ASOC and UNEP (2003), the inspection system is essential to the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty and its Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection.  Inspections provide critical information on the level of compliance with the Treaty and the Protocol’s provisions and help identify issues that need further attention from the Parties. They are also learning experiences for both the inspected Parties and for the Parties conducting the inspection. 

Based on the 2003 review, ASOC and UNEP recommended that future inspections could usefully focus on:
     Stations that have never been inspected or not been inspected since the adoption of the Protocol;
     Stations of Parties that have never or seldom had inspections to their facilities;
     Inland stations;
     Decommissioned, abandoned or infrequently used sites or facilities;
     Stations that have been inspected and have shown repeatedly that some aspects of their operations are falling short of the Protocol’s requirements;
     Other sites or facilities that are not stations (such as field huts, fuel depots, drilling sites);
     Ships, including vessels engaged in tourism and other non-governmental activities; and,
     Sites where tourism operations frequently take place.

The present review shows that since the entry into force of the Protocol progress has been made in terms of the number of inspections, the number of stations inspected, including stations that had not previously been inspected, and the number of inland facilities that were inspected.  It must, however, be noted that while the number of inspections has increased, so has the number of sites facilities.
There were a relatively limited number of inspections to facilities that are not active research stations, and to other kinds of sites.  Tourism activities in all its dimensions – ships, sites, and onsite activities – have received few inspections, with the exception of six ships, a tourism monitoring camp, and one land based facility.  This is surprising considering the expansion of tourism since 1998.
The listing of facilities and sites in the Antarctic is comprehensive for research stations and, by and large, for sites used by tourism, but less comprehensive for other types of sites.   In addition, there is no comprehensive listing of the vessels operating in the Antarctic Treaty Area that could be subject of inspection under the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol.
    6. Closing remarks
UNEP and ASOC commend the practice of inspections as an essential component to ensure the implementation of the Treaty and the Protocol, as they provide objective information on the level of implementation based on observations on the ground.  
The present analysis covers only some aspects related to the practice of inspections.  It does not provide a review of the inspections’ findings.  Based on the analysis it would appear that the coverage of active stations has been adequate.  Some ASMAs, ASPAs and HSMs have been inspected, but many have not.  Finally, the coverage has been less adequate for facilities and sites other than permanent research stations, such as vessels, and tourism sites and activities in particular.
