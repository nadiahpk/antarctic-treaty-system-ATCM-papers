Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the Thirty-Fifth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
(Submitted by the CCAMLR Secretariat  in the four official languages)

1.	The Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources was held in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, from 24 October to 4 November 2011. It was chaired by Mr T. Løbach (Norway). The Report of the Meeting is available at: http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cr/drt.htm.

2.	The Chair reported that the Commission had 25 Members and that nine other States are party to the Convention.
3.	During the 2010/11 season, CCAMLR Members participated in 14 fisheries in the Convention Area. Vessels fishing in fisheries managed under conservation measures in force in 2010/11 had reported, by 24 September 2011, a total catch of 179 131 tonnes of krill, 11 254 tonnes of toothfish, and 11 tonnes of icefish. A number of other species were taken as by-catch.1
Finance and administration
4.	The Commission adopted a budget for the Commission and recommendations relating to:
•	a strategic plan for the Secretariat
•	revised financial regulations.
Scientific committee 
5.	Notifications for krill fishing in 2011/12 were received from seven Members and 15 vessels with a notified total predicted catch of 401 000 tonnes.
6.	The Commission noted that fishing for krill had taken place inside ASMA 1 in Admiralty Bay in 2010 and that this may be inconsistent with the management objectives of the ASMA.
7.	In addition to the 11 254 tonnes of toothfish reported from within the Convention Area, catches reported under the Catch Document Scheme (CDS) indicated that 9 190 tonnes of Dissostichus spp. were taken outside the Convention Area in 2010/11 (to 26 September 2011) compared with 12 441 tonnes in 2009/10.
8.	In 2010/11, one Member fished for icefish in Subarea 48.3 with a reported catch of 10 tonnes and one Member fished in Division 58.5.2 and reported a total catch of 1 tonne.
9.	The Commission welcomed the Scientific Committee’s deliberation on climate change and noted the recommendations of the EU/Netherlands-sponsored workshop on ‘Antarctic Krill and Climate Change’.
Chair and Vice-Chair
10.	Dr C. Jones (USA) was elected as Scientific Committee Chair and Dr X. Zhao (China) was elected Vice-Chair.
Bottom fishing
11.	The Commission endorsed the advice of the Scientific Committee including the prohibition of bottom fishing in Subarea 88.1 (SSRU G) to provide protection of registered VMEs from direct effects of interactions with fishing gear.
Assessment of incidental mortality
12.	The Commission noted that the total extrapolated mortalities of seabirds within Subarea 58.6 and Division 58.5.1 was estimated to be 220 and that incidental mortalities elsewhere in the Convention Area were similar to the near-zero levels of recent years.
Marine protected areas
13.	The Commission noted the outcomes of the Workshop on Marine Protected Areas and expressed its gratitude to France for hosting the workshop.
14.	The Commission welcomed the development of planning domains for representative systems of MPAs to replace the priority areas defined in 2008 as the basis for planning MPAs in the Convention Area.
Ross Sea region
15.	The Commission thanked New Zealand and the USA for two scenarios for an MPA in the Ross Sea planning domain, noting the advice of the Scientific Committee that the scenarios are based on the best scientific evidence available and that no further scientific analysis and debate is needed in that Committee.
16.	New Zealand and the USA confirmed their intention of bringing forward proposals for the formal establishment of an MPA in 2012.
East Antarctica
17.	The Commission thanked Australia and France which jointly presented a proposal for a representative system of MPAs (RSMPA) for the whole East Antarctic planning domain.
18.	Australia and France expressed their intention to prepare a conservation measure for consideration in 2012.
Protection of habitats newly exposed by the collapse of ice shelves
19.	The Commission noted the proposal from the UK concerning the protection of marine habitats that may be newly exposed as a consequence of ice-shelf collapse.
Proposal for a general conservation measure on MPAs
20.	The Commission adopted a general conservation measure for the adoption of MPAs.
Implementation and compliance
System of Inspection
21.	No cases of non-compliance with conservation measures were reported as a result of any at-sea inspections undertaken under the System of Inspection.
Environmental and mitigation measures
22.	The Commission noted that reports of non-compliance with all the requirements of CMs 26-01 and 25-02 in 2010/11 had been investigated and no violations had been found.
Compliance evaluation procedure
23.	The Commission noted that a compliance evaluation procedure will be developed for possible adoption at CCAMLR-XXXI.
Catch Documentation Scheme
24.	The Commission revoked Singapore’s status as a Non-Contracting Party cooperating with CCAMLR. The Commission requested that the Chair write to Singapore in relation to this matter.
25.	The Commission requested the Chair to write to the ATS Secretariat to outline CCAMLR’s efforts in engaging with Malaysia to combat IUU. The letter will request that the matter be formally raised with Malaysia at the next opportunity.
Iuu fishing in the convention area
26.	Five vessels were reported to have engaged in IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area and three IUU-listed vessels were sighted outside the Convention Area during 2010/11. Six of the identified vessels were reported to be using gillnets.
27.	The Commission noted that there is no evidence to suggest that IUU fishing has declined and that it continued at a relatively low level, although it was possible it was increasing and that the spatial distribution of IUU fishing may be changing.
28.	The Commission included the Iranian-flagged vessel, the Koosha 4, on the NCP-IUU Vessel List in 2011.
29.	The Commission removed the vessels West Ocean and North Ocean from the CP-IUU Vessel List.
Scheme of international scientific observation
30.	In accordance with the CCAMLR Scheme of International Scientific Observation, scientific observers were deployed on all vessels in all finfish fisheries in the Convention Area in 2010/11.
Conservation measures
31.	Conservation measures and resolutions adopted at CCAMLR-XXX have been published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2011/12.
Krill fisheries
32.	The Commission agreed that krill fishing vessels must ensure that an observer has access to sufficient samples to enable a target coverage rate of at least 20% of hauls or haul units during the period that the observer is on board the vessel per fishing season.
33.	The Commission agreed to retain the interim distribution of the trigger level in the fishery for E. superba in Subareas 48.1 to 48.4 (CM 51-07) for a further three seasons, until the Scientific Committee and WG-EMM complete the development of a feedback management procedure for this fishery.
New conservation measures
Gear regulations and bottom fishing
34.	The Commission agreed that all bottom fishing activities shall be prohibited within the defined area of the registered VMEs, with the exception of scientific research activities agreed by the Commission for monitoring or other purposes on advice from the Scientific Committee.
Fishing seasons, closed areas and prohibition of fishing
35.	Directed fishing for Dissostichus spp. in Subarea 48.5 was prohibited in 2011/12.
By-catch limits
36.	The Commission carried forward the existing by-catch limits in Division 58.5.2 in 2011/12.
37.	The Commission carried forward the by-catch limits for exploratory fisheries in 2011/12, taking account of the revised catch limits for Dissostichus spp. in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, and revised boundaries of SSRUs in Subarea 88.2.
Toothfish
38.	The Commission revised the catch limits, by-catch limits, vessel numbers, move-on rules, research plans, including tagging rates, gear restrictions and fishery prohibitions for the fishery for D. eleginoides in each Subarea.
Icefish
39.	The Commission revised the limits on the fishery for C. gunnari in Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2 for 2011/12 to 0 tonnes, with a 30-tonne research and by-catch limit.
