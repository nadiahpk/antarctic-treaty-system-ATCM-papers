Deception Island Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management Group Report
Information Paper 
Submitted by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, the UK and the USA
1. Introduction
Deception Island was formally adopted as Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 4 by Measure 3 (2005). Working Paper XXVIII ATCM/WP 20 and Information Papers XII SATCM/IP8, XXIV ATCM/IP63, XXV ATCM/IP28 and XXVI ATCM/IP48 summarise the extensive consultation amongst those Parties with major interests in Deception Island, and the process that lead to its adoption as an ASMA.
Following the formal adoption of ASMA No. 4, XXIX ATCM/IP19, and subsequent IPs, reported on the establishment of a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the plan and on the success of the Deception Island Management Group (DIMG) to effectively resolve the previously reported conflicts between science and tourism. 
XXX ATCM IP108, ATCM XXXI IP126, ATCM XXXII IP112, ATCM XXXIII IP 16 and ATCM XXXIV IP 131 has provided annual updates on activities undertaken on Deception Island during the 2006/2007 to 2010/2011 austral summers, and informed the Meeting of the intersessional work of the DIMG.  
The present Information Paper summarizes the activities undertaken within the Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), and the work of the Management Group to fulfil the objectives and principles of ASMA No. 4 Management Plan during the intersessional period (2011-2012).  
2.  Overview of Activities on Deception Island 2011/12
2.1 Science and Logistics 
    • Argentina: Volcanological studies around the island were carried out from mid-December to the end of February. The work was based out from Decepción Station, and was led by Dr. Alberto Caselli. 
    • Chile: Four projects were carried out in January 21st and 22nd 2012, using the Chilean icebreaker “Oscar Viel” as platform. One project included diving activity in Port Foster to collect macro algal samples. Two of the four projects visited the ASPA 140 to collect soil, sediment and snow samples. The Chilean projects were:
    • Addressing biogeographic and phylogeographic scenarios regarding origin and persistence of macro-algal floral diversity in Sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions using taxonomic, ecophysiological and molecular approaches.
    • High latitude meiofaunal macro-ecology and diversity assessed using both morphological and molecular techniques.
    • Isolation of Antarctic microorganisms able to synthesize highly fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles (Quantum Dots) for biotechnological applications.
    • Antimicrobial peptides of Antarctic bacteria. Synthesis and optimization for control of pathogenic bacteria in foods.
On February 15h, the president of Chile visited Deception Island with the president of Uruguay, arriving on board the Chilean vessel AP “Aquiles” and departing by helicopter to King George Island. 
    • Spain: Spanish researchers worked in Gabriel de Castilla Base from November 23th, 2011 to March 2nd, 2012.  During the campaign a telecommunication system (CIS) which has greatly improved the communication capabilities of the base was established. The diesel generator was replaced with two 150 kVA generators. The 1,000 litres oil tank was replaced with two 500 litres double layer tanks. Eleven scientific projects were based at Gabriel de Castilla Base, ten Spanish projects and 1 Portuguese. The Spanish projects were:
    • Ecologic activity of Antarctic benthic marine natural products: chemical ecology in situ, pharmacological potential and alterations caused by human activity.
    • Thermal state of permafrost and active layer evolution in the TSP and CALM-S network stations on Livingston and Deception islands (Antarctica) (PERMAPLANET). 
    • Geodetic and geothermal research, time serial analysis and volcanic innovation in Antarctica (South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula)
    •  Monitoring the seismic-volcanic activity at Deception Island and seismic permanent stations maintenance in South Shetland Islands.
    • Seabed thermal sounding. Port Foster (Antarctica)
    • Diffuse emission of gases and volatiles survey on the environmental surface of Deception Island volcano, Antarctica.
    • Monitoring of impacts derivate from touristic and scientific expeditions in visitors sites and enclaves in Deception Island.
    • Climate change effect on biodiversity and molecular mechanisms of adaptation to environment in psychrophilic microorganisms ( POLARBIOSENSOR2)
    • Bio-molecules detection in planetary exploration
    • Environment gradients in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. Vegetal diversity and productivity from Tierra del Fuego to Transantarctic Mountains.
    • United Kingdom: Conducted survey of Deception Island coastal waters by HMS Protector (January 2012). 
    • United States: Researchers from the US NGO Oceanites arrived on the Yacht Pelagic on November 28th 2011. Additional members of the Oceanites team transferred from the tour ship Ioffe (One Ocean Expeditions) to the Pelagic on December 2nd 2011. Oceanites conducted penguin surveys at Baily Head, Macaroni Point, Vapour Colony and installed a passive acoustic recorder at Baily Head.  The yacht was anchored in the Stancombe Bay anchorage for the duration of the visit.  The colonies were accessed by hiking from Whalers Bay or Stancombe Bay.  The entire Oceanites team departed Deception Island on December 15th 2011. Also on December 15th, the United States' Antarctic Program research vessel LM Gould visited Baily Head. This was a familiarization visit for the US representative to the Deception Island Management Group.  
2.2 Tourist Activities
During the 2011/12 season Deception Island received a total of 218 landings from IAATO member vessels between the period of 4 November 2011 and 22 March 2012 (140 days). This total number of visits consists of 130 landings at Whalers Bay, 47 landings at Telefon Bay, 14 landings at Pendulum Cove, 19 landings at Baily Head, 2 landings to Fumarole Bay, 3 at Stancombe Cove and 3 visits to Gabriel de Casitilla Station.  During this period there were 61 days where more than one visit took place. These occurred either as multiple visits from one vessel or separate visits from separate vessels. These figures do not include landings from non-IAATO yachts.
The Deception Island Management Group has been provided information about the following non-IAATO yacht visits to Deception Island, noting however that this by no means is a complete list of such visits:
    • Antarktikos (authorized by Argentina), tentatively from Jan 17 - 19 2012
    • Landfall (authorized by USA), tentatively Jan 7 - 10 2012
    • Anne Mari (authroized by Norway), tentatively Jan 22-23 2012

Two incidents involving IAATO operators were reported by IAATO to the Deception Island Management Group. The first was the grounding of the MV Sea Spirit in the soft ash bottom at Whalers Bay on 9 December, 2011. The vessel freed itself at the next high water and no damage was done to the hull of the vessel and no damage to the environment was reported. The second instance of involved members of a Gospel group scattering barley seeds at Telefon Bay.  To the best of their ability the field staff collected the seeds, all other seeds were confiscated from the group and they were threatened with not being allowed ashore if they did not respect the guidelines.
3. Work of the Deception Island Management Group (2011-2012)
Chairmanship
The Deception Island Management Group under the Terms of Reference of the Management Group, has decided that Chairmanship of the group shall rotate every two years among the six member Parties. 
After United Kingdom, Argentina and Spain having completed their two years, Norway took over the chairmanship mid 2011 (in conjunction with the ATCM XXXIV in Buenos Aires), and will continue holding this position until mid 2013.  
Work plan
The primary objective of the DIMG in the 2011-12 period has been to complete the comprehensive review of the Deception Island management package from 2005. The objective has been reached, and a revised management package has been put forward to CEP XV in WP 42. In this context the DIMG has also developed draft site visitor guidelines for Pendulum Cove, put forward to CEP XV in WP 45.  
Several challenging issues have surfaced during the revision of the management plan, and will require further discussions before incorporating changes to the management plan:
    • Shipping restrictions. The group has discussed issues relating to shipping restrictions, recognizing that restricting shipping could present some legal issues. 
    • Baily Head. Concern has been expressed by some members with respect to Baily Head and the Chinstrap penguin rookery there (largest in Deception Island and one of the largest in Antarctica). A substantial decrease in the population has been observed at this site, which may require some changes to, or strengthening of, the protection and management of this zone. 
    • Place naming. The issue has been raised with respect to the role of the management group with respect to place names. There are agreed upon procedures for place naming in Antarctica and it is the individual Parties right to set new place names in accordance with such procedures. Yet, it may be relevant to consider how to “safeguard” the joint interests that may be present in an area where one has agreed to cooperate with respect to management (noting, however, that this cooperation relates to coordination of activities within the framework of the Environmental Protocol, and does not extend outside the remit of the Protocol). 
Having concentrated their effort on the review process, the DIMG has not actively discussed or worked on other issues relating to the management plan in the 2011-12 period. The work plan for the Norwegian chairmanship period includes the following issues that may receive more focus in the coming period:
    • Exchange of information and archiving of information
    • Monitoring issues
    • Web review/update
