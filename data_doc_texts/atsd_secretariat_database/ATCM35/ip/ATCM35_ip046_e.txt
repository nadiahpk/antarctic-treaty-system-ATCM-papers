Pilot study on monitoring climate-induced changes in penguin colonies in the Antarctic using satellite images

Information Paper submitted by Germany

Summary
Picking up the calling of the ATCM XXXIV to the Treaty Parties to intensify their efforts in using remote sensing techniques for improved monitoring of environment and climate changes in the Antarctic, Germany carried out a feasibility study on penguin monitoring using such techniques. While a corresponding Working Paper (WP 18) with the proposal to open an Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) on penguin monitoring via remote sensing on the CEP Discussion Forum on the Secretariat website has been submitted to CEP XV, Germany presents the final report of the above mentioned pilot study. 

The final report of the “Pilot study on monitoring climate-induced changes in penguin colonies in the Antarctic using satellite images” is available at http://www.uba.de/uba-info-medien-e/4283.html.
