Management Plan for Romanian Biological Prospecting Activities in Antarctica

Introduction
In Resolution 9 (2009), ATCM recommended that “their Governments to reaffirm that Antarctic Treaty System is the appropriate framework for managing the collection of biological material in the Antarctic Treaty area and for considering its use”. Antarctic coastal ice-free areas - such as the Larsemann Hills - are rare, making up less than 0.5% of the continent. The relatively favorable habitat and climate, proximity to the ocean, and availability of fresh water, mean that such “oases” are “hotspots” of Antarctic biodiversity. The archaic structure of the aquatic ecosystems in Larsemann Hills can hide species with new properties, not described until now, with potential applications for new biotechnologies. 
Extremophile microorganisms isolated from excessive climatic ecosystems for new biotechnologies (EXMIB) PROJECT
In November 2011, the National Institute for Chemical Pharmaceutical Research and Development (INCDCF) from Romania launched the EXMIB Project in partnership with three national research institutes. The two major objectives of INCDCF are: (a) enriching the national industrial microorganism collection (registered at World Federation Culture Collection under no. 232) with new extremophile microorganisms selected from frozen and hot deserts and (b) isolation and selection of the extremolites with virucidal, antimicrobial and anticancer activities for potential pharmaceutical applications. 
As a part of the EXMIB Project, the “Stefan S. Nicolau” Institute of Virology of the Romanian Academy will conduct the biological prospecting activities in Antarctica in order to discover the new microorganisms adapted to live in cold extreme environments (known as psychrophiles). The activities in the field will be developed based on the experience acquired by the principal investigator of  Institute of Virology during the first Romanian National Antarctic Research Expedition (1st RONARE) at Station Law-Racovita (Australia-Romania) from Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica during summer 2005-2006. [This station was rename Law-Racovita-Negoita in honour of the Romanian Dr. Ing. Teodor Gheorghe Negoita (1946-2011)]. 
Management Plan for Romanian Biological Prospecting in Antarctica 
Romanian Antarctic Scientific Activities in Larsemann Hills in compliance with the Protocol on Environment Protection to Antarctic Treaty 
- To organize the 3rd Romanian National Antarctic Research Expedition in Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, in summer 2012-2013 / 2013-2014.
- To develop the Protocol for the biological prospecting in Larsemann Hills including the exploration and identify ecological niches, the criteria for selection of biological points of interest within a niche, collecting techniques of soil, rocks, sea and lake waters, lake sediment, meltwater, ice from cap, bergs, sea, cave, terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, as well as the techniques of the preliminary processing of the sea water samples on icebreaker in biochemistry laboratory and the conditions for preservation of samples on Antarctic continent, Australian customs and during the transport on the ocean, in the air planes and in national laboratories. 
- To arrange a small laboratory of biology in the workstation.
- To make available the up-to-date information on the location of depositories of samples and collections resulting from Romanian scientific research in Antarctica in according with Recommendation ATCM XIII-1, paragraph 5 (a). 
Scientific Cooperation and Facilities within Antarctic Treaty System 
- To continue and develop the cooperation of the scientists from Romania with the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration in order to go with the 29th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition for doing scientific work on Antarctic Ocean and within ASMA no 6 (Larsemann Hills). 
- To ensure free exchanges of information between researchers regarding the biological prospecting in ASMA no 6 managed by Australia, China, India, Russia and Romania and to develop a joint paper to the future ATCM.
