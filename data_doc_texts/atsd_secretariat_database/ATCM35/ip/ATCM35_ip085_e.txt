Report of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition
    1. Introduction
ASOC is pleased to be in Australia for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. This report briefly describes ASOC’s work over the past year, and outlines some key issues for this ATCM. 
ASOC’s Secretariat is in Washington DC, USA and its website is http://www.asoc.org). ASOC has 20 full member groups in 8 countries and supporting groups in those and several other countries. ASOC campaigns are carried out by teams of experts in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, UK and USA.
    2. ASOC Intersessional Activities Since XXXIV ATCM

    3. Information Papers for XXXV ATCM
ASOC has introduced 11 Information Papers, which contain recommendations for the ATCM and CEP that will help achieve more effective environmental protection and conservation of Antarctica:
Annex V Inviolate and Reference Areas: Current Management Practices (IP 49). Setting aside inviolate areas to preserve reference areas for future research is a tool specifically called for in Annex V of the Protocol but it is under-used, with inviolate areas covering only a very small proportion of the Treaty area. The designation of inviolate areas of significant size will provide reference sites that remain pristine and available for different fields of scientific interest in the future and contribute to protection of Antarctica’s wilderness values. 
Antarctic Ocean Legacy: A Marine Reserve for the Ross Sea (IP 50) summarises this Antarctic Ocean Alliance (AOA) report). The report, appended to this IP, describes AOA’s proposal and the rationale for designation.  
Data Sources for Mapping the Human Footprint in Antarctica (IP 52). The first step in constructing a model of the human footprint in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is to compile data from the different information repositories in a common format. This would help to fulfill the CEP’s obligation to advise the ATCM on the state of the Antarctic environment and facilitate Treaty Parties and CCAMLR Members taking coherent steps through time to limit the human footprint.

Antarctic Treaty System Follow-up to Vessel Incidents in Antarctic Waters (IP 53) undertakes a preliminary assessment of reporting following vessel incidents. It identifies shortcomings in the current system and recommends that the ATCM and CCAMLR address these as a matter of urgency. Annex 1 provides a list of incidents in Antarctic waters in the past 6 years involving cruise ships, fishing vessels and yachts.

Implications of Antarctic krill fishing in ASMA No.1 - Admiralty Bay (IP 54) reviews the cooperation framework between the ATCM and CCAMLR in the light of krill fishing that took place that is not envisioned in the Management Plan. The paper offers a series of recommendations to the CEP, ATCM and CCAMLR to prevent future such events. 

Key Issues on a Strategic Approach to Review Tourism Policies (IP 55) concludes that increased supervision of tourism, through inspections or other means, is necessary to match the scale of this activity. Some aspects of tourism, particularly expansion, diversification and new site occupation, should be addressed in a proactive manner through legally binding regulation. Identifying tourism impacts requires additional monitoring efforts.  Failing to address these issues in a timely manner will jeopardize the values the Protocol seeks to protect.  

Progress on the Development of a Mandatory Polar Code (IP 56) provides an update on development of the Polar Code by the International Maritime Organization. It highlights areas where further work is required, identifies the next steps towards completion of the Code, and raises concerns about the possible minimal impact of the Code on Antarctic vessels if there is insufficient leadership by Antarctic Treaty states at the IMO. It recommends that Antarctic Treaty Parties ensure that the Code includes an Environmental Protection Chapter, is applied to both new and existing vessels, and requires polar class standards for all vessels likely to encounter ice.

Repair or Remediation of Environmental Damage (IP 57) reviews several key issues associated with the repair and remediation of environmental damage. The paper concludes that there is a general understanding of what constitutes environmental damage in Antarctica, that repairing or remediation of environmental damage should be carried out to the extent possible, and that at minimum assessment and monitoring of damage and suitable reporting should be done.  

Earth Hour Antarctica 2013 (IP 58). WWF’s Earth Hour is the world’s largest environmental initiative in which people, businesses and governments around the world turn out lights for one hour to take a stand against climate change and show that everyone can act to change the world they live in. ASOC, Australia and the UK propose a coordinated continent–wide switch off of all non-essential lights at Antarctic research stations for Earth Hour on March 30, 2013, within operational and safety constraints.

Review of the Implementation of the Madrid Protocol: Inspections by Parties (Article 14) (IP 59).  This joint paper with UNEP reviews the practice of inspections undertaken by Parties carried out under Article 14 of the Madrid Protocol. Fourteen inspections have been conducted since 1998, of 83 different facilities or sites. Of the 101 facilities on the COMNAP list, 56 (55%) have been inspected and 45 (45%) have never been inspected. Seven vessels, of which six were tourist vessels, were inspected during the same period.

Antarctic Ocean Legacy: A Vision for Circumpolar Protection (IP 90). In October 2011 the AOA  proposed the creation of a network of marine protected areas and no-take marine reserves in 19 specific areas in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. The report, attached to this IP, elaborates that vision. The report covers areas that collectively capture a wide, representative range of habitats and ecosystems, including seafloor and pelagic ecoregions, different environmental types, rare and unusual biological features, and areas critical for ecosystem and species protection.

    4. Other Important Issues for XXXV ATCM
    • Climate change: It is imperative for the ATCM to inform the rest of the world about the effects of what is happening in Antarctica and its implications for the global climate system, and to do more to reduce the impacts of its activities in the Antarctic. 
    • Annex VI on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies: Bringing this important Annex into force as rapidly as possible should be a high priority. ASOC urges all Parties to redouble their efforts over the next year to solve the remaining implementation problems, so that Annex VI can be ratified and enter into force as quickly as possible. 
    • Biological prospecting: ASOC supports a framework that includes more transparent sharing of data and information by Parties, based on full compliance with Resolution 9 (2009). ASOC urges the Parties to resume substantive discussion of bio-prospecting based on the information flowing from Treaty and Protocol information sharing requiring requirements as well as the data and information provided by the UN University, the Belgian database, and SCAR’s reports.

    • Strategic planning: ASOC supports the development of a multiyear strategic plan for the ATCM, which will help Parties in managing human activities sustainably over the longer term. 

    • Search and Rescue: Improving search and rescue coordination and capacity, including the development of a real-time information exchange communications system, should be an important priority for the Parties. 

    • Sub-glacial lakes: ASOC continues to be concerned about the fate of pristine Lake Vostok, and urges Parties to discuss the activities carried out in the past year in the attempt to penetrate the lake, and the next steps, with a view to minimizing risks to the lake’s ecosystem as well as providing lessons for exploring other sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica. 
    5. Concluding Remarks
Antarctica is facing many pressures from global climate change and a wide range of human activities. ASOC looks forward to the ATCPs having the vision and taking concrete actions in Hobart that will help protect Antarctica’s ecosystems and intrinsic values over the longer term.
