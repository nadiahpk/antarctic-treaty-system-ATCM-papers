Repair or Remediation of Environmental Damage
Information Paper submitted by ASOC1 
Abstract
In 2010 the XXXIII ATCM requested the CEP “to consider environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage in the circumstances of Antarctica, in order to assist the ATCM in adopting an informed decision in 2015 related to the resumption of the negotiations [on the liability regime]” (Decision 4, 2010, under (3)).  Following this request, In 2011 Australia submitted XXXIV ATCM/WP28 identifying several suggested points for inclusion in the CEP’s response to the ATCM (Australia, 2011).  This Information Paper reviews some of the key issues associated with the repair or remediation of environmental damage and comments on the various points suggested by Australia in WP28.  ASOC agrees that the eight key points raised by Australia are relevant when formulating its response to Decision 4 (2010).  Overall, there is a general understanding of what constitutes environmental damage in Antarctica; repairing and remediation of environmental damage should be carried out to the extent possible, while taking into consideration the adverse environmental effects that repair and remediation could have; and at a minimum, the assessment and monitoring of damage, suitable recording and reporting should be carried out.  
Introduction
In 2010 the XXXIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) requested the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) “to consider environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage in the circumstances of Antarctica, in order to assist the ATCM in adopting an informed decision in 2015 related to the resumption of the negotiations [on the liability regime]” (Decision 4, 2010, under (3)).  Following this request, in 2011 Australia submitted ATCM XXXIV/WP28 Environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage identifying several suggested points for inclusion in the Committee’s response to the ATCM.  
In this Information Paper ASOC discusses some of the key issues associated with the repair or remediation of environmental damage, including the concept of environmental damage in the Antarctic Treaty System, and comments on the various points suggested in WP28.  For the purposes of this information paper the concept of environmental damage applies to past activities (Annex III), ongoing activities (much of the Protocol as well as Annexes II, III and IV), proposed activities (Annex I) and incidents and accidents (Annex VI).
The concept of environmental damage
A family of terms are used in the Antarctic context to refer to anthropogenic transformations to the natural environment in Antarctica. These include, with reference to the environment, “impact”, “harm”, and “damage”.  In this discussion we will focus on the term “damage”.  XXXIV ATCM/WP48 noted that the term “environmental damage” is not defined in the Protocol or annexes, and recalled the advice of SCAR in ATCM XXIV/WP14 that the terms “harm” or “damage” are not scientific concepts but rather cultural and legal concepts. However, WP48 provided a list of points that are applicable under any reasonable definition of damage.  Furthermore, there are some academic and practical definitions to these terms (e.g. Stonehouse 2001, ATCPs 2005) and a general understanding of environmental damage (or impacts) associated with Antarctic activities (e.g. Tin et al. 2009 and refs.)   
Although the Protocol does not define “environmental damage”, it contains several references to this term as it applies to the natural and historic environments (as distinct from damage to infrastructure), which provide some guidance even though it does not cover the entire spectrum of potential environmental damage.  Thus the Protocol:  
    • Requires Parties to cooperate in providing to other Parties upon request information relevant to any potential environmental risk and assistance to minimize the effects of accidents which may damage the Antarctic environment or dependent and associated ecosystems (Art. 6 (1)(c));
    • Requires Parties to elaborate rules and procedures relating to liability for damage arising from activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty area (Art. 16);
    • Provides a definition of "take" or "taking" that includes “to remove or damage such quantities of native plants that their local distribution or abundance would be significantly affected (Annex II, Art. 1 (g)); 
    • Prohibits damage to listed Historic Sites and Monuments (Annex V, Art. 8(4)); and
    • Requires Parties to obtain and exchange information regarding “any significant change or damage to any Antarctic Specially Managed Area, Antarctic Specially Protected Area or Historic Site or Monument (Annex V, Article 10 (1)(b).
COMNAP (2003) presented several examples of “worst case” and “less than worst case” scenarios that could cause environmental harm resulting from national Antarctic program activities.  Worst case scenarios include:
    • Introduction of pollutants into a unique ecosystem; 
    • Ship foundering where no primary action is possible; 
    • Crash of a large aircraft where no primary action is possible;
    • Human introduction of non-indigenous species;
    • Rupture of an uncontained fuel storage tank where no primary action is possible; and
    • Human introduction of disease resulting in the destruction of fauna or flora.

COMNAP (2003) concluded that the worst case land-based emergency would be the unplanned pollution of a hitherto pristine environment, while the worst case marine emergency would be the foundering of a ship in an environmentally sensitive coastal area.   

In the same document, COMNAP identified a range of “less than worst case” scenarios involving aircraft, ships, active or abandoned facilities, field camps, and vehicles.
    • At abandoned sites or facilities, running of melt water through abandoned tips (landfills), and leaking from abandoned fuel tanks;
    • Aircraft crash involving spillage of fuel <20,000 litres;
    • At research stations, rupture of ship to shore fuel hoses during the refuelling of stations; spills resulting from overfilling of tanks; failure in pipe connections; punctured storage drums;
    • In remote locations, spills resulting from careless fuel transfers and leaking drums;
    • Crash of small aircraft or helicopters with spill <1,000 litres;
    • Leakage of unattended drums or storage containers;
    • Failed lines resulting in leaks or dumping from the sewage system onto ice or ice free land;
    • Improper handling of waste resulting in material being dispersed by the wind;
    • Vehicles falling through sea ice while working on or transiting across it;
    • Ship going aground or impacting ice; 
    • Rupture of a storage tank and minor breaching of containment;
    • Chemical and other hazardous material spills, including drilling fluids; and
    • Vehicle overturns or otherwise spills fuel or other hazardous material.
These types of events, while causing less damage than “worst case” scenarios, are arguably more likely to occur and should be taken in particular consideration in the repair and restoration of environmental damage.  
Furthermore, recent inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol report instances of environmental damage at some research stations.  The term “environmental damage” is used in some inspection reports but not in others, however most inspections report on environmental issues associated with, inter alia, abandoned sites, waste management practises, and fuel storage and handling.2
Environmental damage may also result from tourism activities, and cumulative impacts are a cause of particular concern.  Repeated visits by ship-based tourists, coupled with other human activities, could have cumulative effects on the landscape, flora, fauna, historic sites, and science programs and support activities in the areas visited, and on nearby marine areas (Hofman and Jatko, 2000).  Tourism is potentially one of the vectors for the introduction of non-native species (Chown et al, 2012).  The list of potential and actual impacts related to tourism is more comprehensive (CEP in prep. and refs.).
This discussion sets the background for which the CEP response to the ATCM has to be considered. Overall, there is a general understanding of what constitutes environmental damage resulting from accidents, incidents, standard operations of national Antarctic programs and tour operators, and cumulative effects from all past, present and foreseeable future activities at particular sites, including in particular sites where there is a concentration of activities.  
Based on the various examples above, common forms of environmental damage in the Antarctic include the presence of movable or unmovable anthropogenic materials on the polar environment, including contamination with spilled chemicals (fuel, oil, and others); physical modifications to the landscape or the marine/coastal environment; impacts of various kinds on flora and fauna; and the introduction of alien species.  Furthermore, different kinds of environmental damage may interact with each other, resulting in further damage.  

Note that interactions between people and the environment may occur at different activity, spatial and temporal scales and so can the resulting environmental damage.  Consequently, repair and remediation can be relevant and necessary at any of these scales too.  In the following section we focus on environmental damage of the types illustrated in the examples above.
Points for consideration in the CEP’s response to the ATCM
1.	Avoiding environmental damage is highly preferable in all cases
Yes.  This applies to future environmental damage, as well as to carry on effects of past environmental damage, some of which pre-dates the Protocol.  
2.	Timely recording and reporting of environmental damage is important
Yes.  ASOC supports appropriate recording and reporting in all instances, particularly when remediation is not advisable as it could cause further environmental damage (in the sense of Annex III, Art. 1 (5)(b)) or for other valid reasons.  Recording should include the use of monitoring methods appropriate to the type and scale of environmental damage.3 
Reporting should include not only relevant national agencies but also the CEP and COMNAP in instances of fairly substantive, if localized, environmental damage, such as that resulting from the examples on the list of “less than worst case scenarios”.  Additional reporting through the CEP could be done through annual reporting requirement under Art. 17 of the Protocol.
3.	The environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage will need to be assessed on a case-by-case and site-specific basis
Yes. The important factor is that actions are taken to ensure that the environmental damage is actually assessed (as distinct from environmental damage being simply ignored).  Such assessment will necessarily mean that each individual case will be considered separately.
4.	Standard environmental risk management processes can be applied, with due consideration to the circumstances of Antarctica
Yes, and it would be useful for the CEP and ATCM to spell out which “standard” risk management processes are envisioned. This will help all Parties improve their practices. 
5.	Objectives for repair or remediation should reflect the objectives and provisions of the Environmental Protocol, and be appropriate to Antarctic conditions
ASOC fully agrees with the first part regarding fulfilling the Protocol’s obligations.  
The second component – appropriateness to Antarctic conditions – is somewhat ambiguous.  It is not clear if it refers to the peculiarities of the Antarctic environment and climate; to logistic and practical aspects; or both.
6.	Consideration should be given to whether repair or remediation of environmental damage by any practical option will result in greater adverse environmental impact
This is a requirement of the Protocol.  However, it should not be used lightly to dismiss a priori the need for repair and remediation of environmental damage.
7.	Assessment of options for repair and remediation will also need to consider operational feasibility
Operational feasibility needs to be considered, but not used as an argument to delay or avoid taking action.  In particular, recording and reporting of damage is a basic form of action that should be applied in all instances.  
Although each case will be different, it would seem that only some of the “worst case” scenarios would result in inability to take primary action.  Some level of action is possible in most other instances.  In some instances this might include the temporary (or permanent) cancellation of activities at a particular site.
8.	Generally applicable standards, guidelines and techniques relevant to the Antarctic context will assist
Yes.  There is already guidance from CEP and COMNAP with respect to, inter alia, environmental impact assessment and monitoring, non-native species, operations such as waste management, fuel storage and handling, ballast water, and aircraft operations near concentrations of birds, which should be used by Antarctic operators.  Nonetheless, more attention should be given to practical issues of clean-up of contaminated frozen ground; spillage at sea or on coastal waters; dealing with release of invasive alien species, including on-site removal if appropriate; and assessing, monitoring and managing of cumulative effects (including from tourism).
Closing remarks
ASOC agrees that the eight key points raised by Australia are relevant when formulating its response to Decision 4 (2010) and cover the most important aspects of repair and remediation of environmental damage.  

Overall, there is a general understanding of what constitutes environmental damage in Antarctica.  The notion of environmental damage applies to past activities (Annex III), ongoing activities (much of the Protocol as well as Annexes II, III and IV of the Protocol), proposed activities (Annex I) and incidents and accidents (Annex VI).  Repairing and remediation of environmental damage is a requirement of the Protocol and should be carried out to the maximum extent possible, while taking into consideration the adverse environmental effects that repair and remediation could have.  At a minimum, the assessment and monitoring of damage, suitable recording and reporting should be carried out.  However, instances of no assessment and/or no action in the face of environmental damage seem still common and require action by Parties.  These issues should be considered by the CEP in its advice to the ATCM.
