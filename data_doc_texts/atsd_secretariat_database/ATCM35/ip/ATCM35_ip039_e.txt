IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2011-12 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2012-13 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide an overview of Antarctic tourism from IAATO operators for the recently completed 2011-12 season and estimates for the 2012-13 season.

The total number of passengers and clients carried by IAATO operators during the 2011-12 decreased to 26,519. This is a decline of 21.6 percent from the previous 2010-11 Antarctic tourism season (33,824). Details of the 2011-12 season can be found in Appendix 1 of this paper.

While worldwide economic factors were responsible for the declines across all forms of Antarctic tourism in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11, the sharp decrease during the 2011-12 season was due to changes in International Maritime Organization (IMO) MARPOL Annex I, which came into effect August 1, 2011. These changes banned the use and carriage of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in the Antarctic Treaty area and had a significant impact on the number of overall tourists to Antarctica as it reduced the number of voyages by IAATO cruise-only operators, who use vessels carrying more than 500 passengers.

Estimates for the 2012-13 season can be found in Appendix 3 of this paper. These estimates are based on information provided to IAATO by its operators as of May 16, 2012, and indicate a total of 34,950 tourists.  This brings the total number of tourists to Antarctica back in the vicinity of the 2010-2011 season total.

1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
IAATO Membership continues to incorporate the majority of recognized private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS Passenger Ship operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty area belong to IAATO at the present time. All these operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.

While there was an overall decrease in total passenger numbers, this trend was not uniform across all segments. A summary of IAATO operator activities for the 2011-12 season follows:

    • 21,131 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area, a 10.8 percent increase over the previous season’s total of 19,065 vessel-landed passengers. Of this total:
        ◦ 19,269 passengers aboard 173 voyages on traditional seaborne vessels landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area, a slight increase over the previous season’s 18,021 passengers and 172 voyages;
        ◦ 773 passengers took part in 11 voyages to the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica, an increase from the previous season’s 331 passengers and five voyages. This increase was due, in part, to interest in the centenary of Douglas Mawson’s Antarctic expedition;
        ◦ 229 passengers sailed on 30 trips aboard yachts (sailing or motor) that carry 12 or fewer passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area, an increase over the previous season’s 182 passengers and 24 trips;
        ◦ 860 passengers participated in 15 air-cruise trips in the Antarctic Peninsula area, flying to/from King George Island (either one-way or round-trip) from/to South America to embark a vessel and cruise for approximately one week, making landings. This represents an increase over the 531 passengers and 12 air-cruise trips during the 2010-11 season. The three IAATO operators participating in this air-cruise segment included one operator with a decade of air-cruise experience and two other operators – both experienced in traditional seaborne cruising – testing the air-cruise concept for the first time.

    • 4,872 passengers travelled on five voyages aboard 500-plus-passenger vessels operating “cruise-only” voyages, making no landings in the Antarctic Treaty Area. This is a marked decrease from the 14,373 passengers and 10 cruise-only voyages during the previous 2010-11 season, and as mentioned above, is due to ban on the use and carriage of HFO coming into force.

    • 516 clients participated in multi-day land expeditions in the continental interior, an increase over the 386 clients in this segment during the 2010-11 season. This increase was largely due to expeditions and activities held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the attainment of the South Pole in 1911-12. 

    • No passengers participated in IAATO operator over-flights to the Antarctic continent.

1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourism activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, running events, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. 
Appendices 1 and 3 to this annual report provide further details of the scope of IAATO-member activities, including vessel/aircraft, departures, passenger numbers and activities.

The vast majority of tourism voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from November to March), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Treaty Area. 

1.3	Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more than 100 different nationalities were represented in tourists who visited the Antarctic during the 20101-112 season. The majority (83.3 percent) came from 10 different countries (see Table 2).

1.4	Commercial Tour Vessels Operating in 2011-12
A full list of IAATO operator commercial tour vessels that completed cruises to the Antarctic, including information on their registry, permitting authority and passenger capacity is given in Appendix 1. In total, there were 23 vessels carrying 13-200 passengers; one vessel carrying 201-500 passengers; plus four cruise-only vessels each carrying more than 500 passengers.

1.5	Yacht (Sailing and Motor) Activities
Thirteen yachts carrying 12 or fewer tourists visited the Antarctic Treaty Area by IAATO member yacht operators during the 2011-12 season. This information is also detailed in Appendix 1. Another IAATO yacht was used only for research support this past season and so is not included in this overview. 

IAATO Yacht operators’ account for only 37.8 percent of the total known number of yachts visiting Antarctica during 2011-12. As in previous years, IAATO is concerned about yachts that are not authorized and whose crews may not be familiar with the Environmental Protocol and its obligations or the peculiarities of the Antarctic environment. Yacht sightings in the Antarctic Peninsula are further described in ATCM XXXV IP42 Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2011-12.  

1.6	IAATO Member-Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels & Yachts
Details of the activities offered are listed in Appendix 1 and Appendix 3. All activities are approved or authorized through the Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documentation submitted in advance of the season. All activities are intended to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for more than a decade. 
Additional information on Antarctic Peninsula activities is presented in ATCM XXXV IP37 Report on IAATO Operator use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2011-12 Season.



1.7	Commercial Land Tourism 
Three IAATO operators conducted land tourism activities during the 2011-12 season. Adventure Network International / Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below) conducted activities for the 26th consecutive season, and The Antarctic Company (referred to as TAC below) operated in Antarctica for the seventh consecutive season and third as an IAATO operator.
The third company is White Desert (referred to as WDL below), which operated in Antarctica for the sixth consecutive season and second as an IAATO operator. Flights and logistics for White Desert are coordinated through TAC.
ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and White Desert operated out of Cape Town, South Africa.
The three companies employed experienced guides, over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in Antarctica.

1.8	Air / Land Activities conducted by IAATO Members in the Antarctic Peninsula1
For the 2011-12 season, IAATO associate member Destination Management Chile (DMC), operating through Aerovías DAP (a non-IAATO member), conducted three separate day-trips from Punta Arenas, Chile to King George Island. A total of 102 passengers were escorted to Frei and Bellingshausen Bases and took part in Zodiac rides to Ardley Island in groups of 20 visitors at a time. Eighteen other planned trips were cancelled due to weather conditions, not meeting the minimum numbers, or other external factors.

1.9	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members
For the 2011-12 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO members.

2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2012-13 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2012-13 season. According to estimates provided to IAATO by its operators (as of May 16, 2012), 22,544 seaborne and yacht (sailing and motor) passengers are expected to land in Antarctica from commercially organized vessels, 2,064 from combination air-cruise programs, and 476 on air/land expeditions during the 2011-12 season. Another 9,866 are anticipated on cruise-only programs. No over-flights by IAATO operators are expected during the 2012-13 season.
Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B, Naiad, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of underwater ROVs.

Following four years of declining passenger numbers to Antarctica due to the effects of the worldwide economic slowdown and, more recently, the ban on HFO in Antarctic waters, tourism is expected to increase during the 2012-13 season, with an estimated 34,950 Antarctic passengers and clients overall carried by IAATO operators. The increase is expected from the following categories of Antarctic tourism:
    • An 11.2 percent increase in passengers aboard the traditional seaborne category (with landings) due primarily to three voyages from a new category 2 vessel (201-500 passengers) operator and three voyages from another category 2 vessel operator who has not been active for the past two seasons.
    • An increase from 860 passengers in the air / cruise category to 2,064, representing 5.9 percent of the overall Antarctic tourism market carried by IAATO operators. This increase is due, in part, to the IAATO operator with ten-years of experience of air/cruise operations doubling their operations from one to two six-week sets of operation in Antarctic waters (leaving the Treaty Area for bunkering, and re-supply between these two periods of operation). 
    • An increase from five to seven voyages by vessels in the cruise-only category (500-plus passengers), with a corresponding increase in passengers from 4,872 to 9,866. 

Demand to visit Antarctica is expected to continue, and IAATO members will work together so that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that tourism activities have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

3.0 Tourism Trends
A trends chart showing the change in IAATO operator landed passengers, dating from the 1992-1993 season and including estimates for the 2012-13 season, can be found in Appendix 2 of this paper.
