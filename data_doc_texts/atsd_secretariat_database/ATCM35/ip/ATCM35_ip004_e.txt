Management Implications of a Changing Antarctica
COMNAP Workshop
Background
 “The Management Implications of a Changing Antarctica” Workshop was held on the margins of the COMNAP XXIII AGM, in Stockholm, Sweden.  The topic is one that National Antarctic Programs Managers think about every day, since they must monitor and respond to change in order to successfully support their Antarctic science.  It is also a topic which has been recently discussed in a number of other fora, including, at the ATCM/CEP, particularly, as a result of the SCAR Antarctica and Climate Change and the Environment (ACCE) Report, but also as a result of the ATME on climate change (Svolvær, 2010).
 
Individually, some of the National Antarctic Programs have already begun to formally consider the implications to their programs of change.  CCAMLR has also considered the implications of change on the marine ecosystem and IAATO established a working group on the topic in 2009.

The workshop was convened by Jose Retamales (then COMNAP Chair) and by Michelle Rogan-Finnemore (COMNAP Executive Secretary) on 31 July 2011 and was attended by 28 people. A summary of key discussions is presented below.

Workshop considerations
The National Antarctic Programs have a long and well recognized understanding of the Antarctic region. There is a growing recognition that Antarctic “business as usual” is tending to become an unrealistic expectation. This puts pressure on the need to better co-ordinate Antarctic research activities, avoid redundant/overlapping research and maximize capabilities and strengths.  The workshop presented an opportunity for experienced Antarctic personnel to discuss: What changes they are witnessing in relation to the Antarctic Region? How external influences are changing how we provide and manage support to Antarctic science and what all these changes mean for the management of human activity in the Antarctic? How will the changes we are seeing affect “international co-operation in scientific investigation” that we support and that is the fundamental pillar of the ATS and the role of COMNAP? Can we use our knowledge to assist each other and to provide good advice, based on our first-hand knowledge of Antarctica, to the ATCM/CEP?


Summary of key discussions 
Workshop participants broke-out into four groups.  Each group explored one of four scenarios and then reported back in plenary on their discussions.

Group 1: Current Changes National Antarctic Programs are witnessing in Antarctica
    • Two important issues identified: (1) physical changes in the Antarctic that are definitely  due to climate change, and (2) unpredictable climate trends on which more information was required.  
    • They noted that difference parts of Antarctica are acting differently.  Sea ice was one such example, where for 2010-2011 there was little to no sea ice in the Ross Sea Region; but, significant/thick sea ice in other areas.  The unpredictability of sea ice was the real problem, not the fact that is changing, but that you cannot predict nor prepare for a particular sea ice condition from season to season. Some were also seeing changes in snow accumulation and ice runway melt.
    • There may well be biological changes occurring.  But to determine this requires additional data. It would be beneficial if this question was given greater research priority.
    • The ability to predict or predetermine the general weather conditions for the season ahead would be useful and would greatly assist in planning but requires more advanced science than what is currently available. 
    • Distinguishing between climate-related change and local human impacts is difficult and is not always clear. Such determinations require more information and involvement of other bodies.

Group 2: Looking 10 years into the future – what changes can we expect in the time period to 2021?
    • It would not be “business as usual” meaning that because of climate and other changes, operating in Antarctica is more difficult than previously, possibly requiring changes to station locations, other operational infrastructures and work procedures.  
    • This will require a “pioneering attitude”, meaning more flexibility in the planning and execution of Antarctic activities, in combination with being more precautious.
    • There is recognition that National Antarctic Programs deliver their research programs in an ATCM/CEP framework, which has rules and regulations. While we get a significant amount of information from the ATCM, we need to translate that information into practical tools, common understandings and pinpoint important matters. The group indicated the important role of COMNAP in this 'translation' process. 
    • There will be a need to facilitate access for researchers to different areas of interest in the Antarctic for science/or monitoring.
    • There is a feeling that tourism will likely increase in this time period.  Such increase might mean that a “common code of conduct” to assist National Antarctic Programs might be helpful.

Group 3: Looking 50 years into the future – what changes can we expect in the time period to 2060 and beyond?
    • The group considered what changes we might expect in this time period, what the risks and benefits of such changes might be and what responses to those changes might be warranted by National Antarctic Programs. The changes were broadly categorized as: 
        ◦ Environmental changes – Examples include biodiversity changes, alien species introductions, and physical changes due to climate changes.
        ◦ Technology advances – Such as increase in air transportation, advances in communication, automation and remote sensing.
        ◦ Political changes – These include changes within the ATS itself (such as Protocol review) and changes in global regional groups, such as the European Union but also with stronger regional groupings likely in Asia and perhaps South America.  Such changes in politics could lead to changes in the values (peaceful use of Antarctica, use for science and environmental protection) that we currently have and therefore might lead to a change in the role of National Antarctic Programs and Managers.
        ◦ Resources – Energy resources may present to us new forms of technology that can be used in Antarctica (hydrogen for example) or the Antarctic opened up for hydrocarbon exploration; there will likely be an increased global food demand, which will lead to increased pressure for fish and krill extraction. This may warrant the introduction of the concept of “environmental services”, with National Antarctic Programs given responsibility for the stewardship of these.
        ◦ Science – New research areas will likely open up (sub-glacial environments, astronomy, astrophysics and space-related research).
        ◦ Economic changes are also likely to occur, impacting program budgets.
    • There are risks and benefits related to the changes noted above.  They include:
        ◦ Environment – Improved monitoring and better collaboration (which may lead to a reduction in numbers of people who do research physically in Antarctica), early warning systems and strong quarantine measures.
        ◦  Technology – Improvements in automation, remote sensing, data management, removal of waste and sustainable energy and extension of the “Antarctic season” – with year round transport.
        ◦ Politics – Priorities will change and there may well be increasing pressure to review the Protocol. Shipping activity is likely to change significantly due to the IMO MPC. Regulations will increase on National Antarctic Programs.
        ◦ Resources – The concept of ecosystem services may create a new role for COMNAP, one of “protector of Antarctic natural resources”. There will likely also be an increased need for SAR with a rise in human activity related to increased fishing and future possible resource extraction.
        ◦ Science – The opening of new research areas will be a benefit.
        ◦ Economics - Changes are likely to require even more co-operation and sharing of facilities and greater regional responses.
    • There will be a need for improved Antarctic early warning systems.
    • To assist with understanding National Antarctic Program budget issues, COMNAP could provide a facility to share information on annual budgets.

Group 4: What “Other/external” changes are National Antarctic Programs currently facing?
    • Enhancing collaboration was necessary because of a decrease in funding but there is also a need for collaboration mechanisms. There already exist formal collaborative projects which are generally for “big science projects” but smaller projects could also be enhanced by informal arrangements.
    • Links between science and operations could be improved by advance information exchange.
    • There is a need for COMNAP to be more proactive at the ATCM/CEP by preparing substantial (and joint) Working Papers. Good Working Papers make the ATCM aware that National Antarctic Programs are an important part of the system.
    • There exists a range of Antarctic values including scientific and environmental values and the relative importance of these values need to be watched closely.  Perhaps there is a need within COMNAP to maintain expertise on environmental issues in our own house.
    • There is a bipolar balance within some National Antarctic Programs and not within others.  The Arctic is particularly important in European countries and it is now taking precedence.
    • The IMO MPC discussions are important, as is tourism and the issue of bioprospecting.
    • The perception that there are not enough early career scientists to be involved in polar issues is not correct.  What is an issue is keeping them supported until they find a permanent position/retaining them.
