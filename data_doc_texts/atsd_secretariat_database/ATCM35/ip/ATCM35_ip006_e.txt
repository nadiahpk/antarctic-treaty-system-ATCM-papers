Topic Summary: CEP Discussions on Clean-Up
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
In support of Working Paper 21 An Antarctic Clean-Up Manual, Australia presents a summary of CEP meeting documents that have addressed the clean-up of waste disposal sites on land, abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities and sites contaminated by fuel spills. Australia also presents several observations that, in its view, are worth recalling during the Committee’s ongoing discussions regarding the repair and remediation of environmental damage.
Background
In 1975 the Antarctic Treaty Parties adopted Recommendation VIII-11, which contained the first agreed guidance for the appropriate management and disposal of waste generated by expeditions and stations, with a view to minimising impacts on the Antarctic environment. As awareness of the potential environmental impacts of the disposal of waste in the Antarctic region increased, in parallel with improvements in logistics and technology, the Parties identified a need for improved on-site treatment of wastes and for the removal of some wastes from the Antarctic Treaty area.
Through Recommendation XV-3 (1989) the Parties adopted more stringent waste disposal and management practices, based on recommendations from a SCAR Panel of Experts on Waste Disposal in the Antarctic, with the aim of minimising impact on the Antarctic environment and minimising interference with scientific research or other legitimate uses of the Antarctic. These practices not only addressed requirements for the management of wastes associated with present and future activities, but also called for programs to clean-up existing waste disposal site and abandoned work sites, and for an inventory of locations of past activities.
Many elements of Recommendation XV-3 are closely reflected in the current provisions for waste disposal and management, contained in Annex III to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Among other requirements Annex III provides, in Article 1.5, that: 
‘Past and present waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities shall be cleaned up by the generator of such wastes and the user of such sites. This obligation shall not be interpreted as requiring:
    a) the removal of any structure designated as a historic site or monument; or
    b) the removal of any structure or waste material in circumstances where the removal by any practical option would result in greater adverse environmental impact than leaving the structure or waste material in its existing location.’
With the intention of providing a useful reference for the Committee’s discussions regarding the repair and remediation of environmental damage, this paper provides:
    • a brief overview of the CEP’s consideration of the clean-up of waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities (below).
    • a table summarising CEP meeting documents on this topic, with links to the full papers available from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat website (see Appendix A); and
    • Australia’s observations of some noteworthy points arising from those papers and discussions.
Overview of the CEP’s consideration of clean-up issues
Between CEP I (1998) and CEP XI (2008) papers addressing clean-up issues were considered under agenda items on waste disposal and/or waste management (see Appendix A). There was no specific agenda item on waste-related matters from CEP XII (2009) to CEP XIV (2011), and papers addressing clean-up were submitted under the agenda item on general matters.
From CEP XI to CEP XIV the issue of clean-up of sites of past activity was identified in the Committee’s strategic work plan as one of the group of lowest priority issues for the Committee’s attention. In response to Decision 4 (2010), which requested the CEP to provide advice to the ATCM on practical issues associated with the repair and remediation of environmental damage, CEP XIV incorporated clean-up into the broader topic of repair and remediation of environmental damage, which it ranked as one its highest priorities for attention.
Observations
In Australia’s view, the following points raised in CEP meeting papers and discussions are worth recalling in the CEP’s continuing work to consider the clean-up of waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities, and the repair and remediation of environmental damage more broadly:
    1) The Committee has repeatedly welcomed reports on work to clean-up old abandoned stations and waste disposal sites as required by Annex III of the Protocol, and since the first CEP meeting 13 Members have submitted Information Papers reporting on clean-up activities and related issues. The Committee has not considered a Working Paper on the subject.
    2) Many of the key points raised in CEP papers are reflected in the main findings of discussions of clean-up at the 2006 COMNAP Workshop on Waste Management in Antarctica, including:
    • The logistical challenges of clean-up and the human and technical resource requirements mean there is considerable benefit in collaboration between national Antarctic programs, and sometimes with private sector operators and non-governmental organisations. 
    • Long-term planning of clean-up operations is important, including reliable site characterisations, design and implementation of clean-up activities, and monitoring during and after clean-up operations. 
    3) The majority of papers reporting on clean-up activities discuss the types and quantity of debris and waste removed from the site, but relatively few outline steps taken to assess and clean-up any associated contaminated ground (although such steps may have been taken).
    4) The 2010 Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Climate Change and Implications for Antarctic Management and Governance noted that the potential environmental implications of sites of past activities emphasised the need to ensure that past waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites are cleaned up in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol.
    5) In 1999 and 2000 the Committee engaged in discussion about establishing an inventory of locations of past activities, as required under Article 8 of Annex III but did not make a recommendation on a preferred way forward. Such information is to be included in the Permanent Information exchanged in accordance with Resolution 6 (2001). The Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) may assist to facilitate a central inventory of locations of past activities.

Fuel spill management in Antarctica: recent advances in first response and remediation 
Australia 

Reported on work by Australia to improve three critical aspects of fuel spill management: protocols for prevention; first response; and remediation. Noted that Australia is researching permeable reactive barriers as a solution to prevent subsurface transport of fuel from spill sites, including a pilot trial at Casey station, as part of a suite of low-cost on-site remediation tools. Noted that rates of natural breakdown are very slow under Antarctic conditions, removal of contaminated material (‘dig and haul’) is costly and has associated environmental impacts and risks. Research into in-situ bioremediation (breakdown of fuel by indigenous soil micro-organisms) has indicated that faster rates of degradation are possible through the careful management of parameters such as nutrients, water, heat and oxygen. Noted that there are currently no definitive petroleum clean-up guidelines for Antarctic conditions, but bioremediation techniques should be able to achieve levels of 150-500 mg fuel/kg (similar to values used by several Arctic countries) in 5-10 years.

COMNAP's 2006 Workshop on Waste Management in Antarctica
COMNAP
Reported that COMNAP’s 2006 Workshop on Waste Management in Antarctica involved a day dedicated to the sharing of practical information on the clean-up of old waste in Antarctica. Main findings included: the importance of partnership among National Programs, and involvement of the private sector when undertaking clean-up operations; the need of long-term planning when addressing clean-up operations, given the fact that such activities usually involve high costs and human & technical resources. In that respect, participants stressed that clean-up operations should be based on reliable site characterisations and that monitoring is a necessary complement to such operations; the importance of written strategies to help understand clean-up operations as part of a process, which may include planning, designing, implementing, monitoring; and the importance of being flexible when undertaking clean-up programs, as they are usually highly dependent on the harsh conditions present in Antarctica. Participants noted the importance of being ready for alternative solutions; the value of communicating results from clean-up operations, particularly to the general public, as a powerful tool to obtain resources for further progress on such operations; the recovery of historical objects as a positive side effect stemming from clean-up activities.

Thala Valley Waste Removal
Australia
Further to ATCM XXIV/IP36, ATCM XXVII/IP54 and ATCM XXIX/IP77 reported that during the 2010/11 season the remaining waste from the old Thala Valley waste disposal site near Casey station was removed. The Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition made its resupply vessel available to Australia for charter to transport 168 purpose built containers of waste to Western Australia for disposal at an authorised secure landfill site. The clean-up project had moved to the final site validation stage, with ongoing monitoring of the long-term ecological recovery of the site and adjacent marine ecosystem. Australia envisaged that the methodology developed through the project would be applicable to the remediation of other similar sites in Antarctica.
