Review of COMNAP Working Papers and Information Papers presented to the ATCM 1988 - 2011

Abstract
To facilitate an understanding of the guidelines, manuals, handbooks and other materials that COMNAP has provided in the past, here we present this review of papers we have submitted to ATCM/CEP meetings since 1988, the year that COMNAP was established as an organization. It is hoped this list can act as a reminder of work achieved to date and may also provide insight into gaps in knowledge on a particular topic of interest to the ATCM or CEP that COMNAP could consider in the future.

Background
COMNAP was established as an independent organization in 1988. As an organization of member National Antarctic Programs, our purpose may be found in the COMNAP Constitution, which is to “develop and promote best practice in managing the support of scientific research in Antarctica". COMNAP does this by fulfilling the following objectives:  
    • Serving as a forum to develop practices that improve effectiveness of activities in an environmentally responsible manner; 
    • Facilitating and promoting international partnerships; 
    • Providing opportunities and systems for information exchange; and 
    • Providing the Antarctic Treaty System with objective and practical, technical and non-political advice drawn from the National Antarctic Programs' pool of expertise.

In support of the COMNAP goal to provide the Antarctic Treaty System with advice from National Antarctic Programs’ pool of expertise, COMNAP has, from 1988 – 2011, submitted 91 papers to the ATCM (23 Working Papers and 68 Information Papers) on various topics, has held 11 Symposiums on Antarctic logistics and operations, and has held an additional 11 workshops on various topical issues which have resulted in 16 published works as recommendations, checklists or some form of guidance to National Antarctic Programs.
