Information Paper submitted by Australia 
Summary
In support of Working Paper 26 Environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage, this paper presents examples to illustrate the points that Australia suggests could be considered by the Committee when addressing Decision 4 (2010).
Background
In Working Paper 26 Environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage, Australia presents suggested points for the Committee’s consideration when responding to Decision 4 (2010)1. This Information Paper presents examples to illustrate those points; the examples are intended as indicative rather than exhaustive.
Examples to illustrate suggested points for consideration by the CEP when addressing Decision 4 (2010)
    1. Avoiding environmental damage is highly preferable in all cases
Decision 4 (2010) contemplates the situation where environmental damage has already occurred. As mentioned above, ATCM XXIV/WP14 and ATCM XXVI/WP29 identify a range of scenarios which might result in environmental damage. The question to the CEP relates not to assessing the likelihood of environmental damage occurring, but to the environmental issues to be considered when deciding whether or not to attempt repair or remediation actions. Nevertheless, the continuing development and implementation of preventative measures is vitally important. 
Examples:
    • In ATCM XXIV/WP 14 COMNAP stated that ‘With preventive measures and contingency response plans in place that have been tailored to activities that have the possibility of generating incidents, both the possibility of an incident and the possibility of inflicting immediate or gradual/cumulative environmental harm is significantly reduced’. Accordingly, the Best Practice for Fuel System Design outlined in the COMNAP Fuel Manual includes a range of guidance to assist with preventing fuel spills.
    • The Non-Native Species Manual adopted under Resolution 6 (2011) similarly places an emphasis on preventive measures, noting that ‘Prevention is the most effective means of minimising the risks associated with the introduction of non-native species and their impacts.’ 
    2. Timely recording and reporting of environmental damage is important
The amount of time that has passed since the environmental damage occurred may have a significant bearing on the options available for, and the effectiveness of, repair or remediation action. A better environmental outcome is likely to be achieved with prompt action, for example the rapid containment or eradication of a non-native species, or the swift removal of toxic waste inadvertently released into the environment. Accordingly, ensuring that environmental damage is recorded and reported as quickly as possible will maximise the chances of effective repair or remediation.
Examples:
    • The Non-Native Species Manual notes that ‘To be effective, responses to introductions should be undertaken as a priority, to prevent an increase in the species’ distribution range and to make eradication simpler, cost effective and more likely to succeed.’
    • Background Paper 12 Clean-up of a fuel spill near Lake Dingle, Vestfold Hills reports on the clean-up of a fuel spill near Lake Dingle in the Vestfold Hills. The incident was immediately reported, and a field crew was on site within hours. The rapid response, including the containment and subsequent removal of contaminated soil prevented most spilt fuel from entering the lake and minimised the overall environmental damage.
    3. The environmental issues related to the practicality of repair or remediation of environmental damage will need to be assessed on a case-by-case and site-specific basis
Similar to the process of predicting and mitigating the environmental impacts of a proposed activity, the environmental issues associated with environmental damage will depend on the characteristics of the damage and the location in which it has occurred, including:
    • Nature: what types of change are imposed on the environment due to the damage (e.g. chemical, biological, physical)
    • Spatial extent: what area / volume has been damaged, and is this likely to increase if the environmental damage is not addressed?
    • Intensity: what is the amount / level /degree of environmental damage?
    • Duration: what is the period of time over which the environment damage is likely to occur?
    • Reversibility: what is the possibility of a return to the initial environmental conditions through natural processes and without human intervention once the damage has occurred and how long is this likely to take?
Examples:
Lake Dingle site assessment (see Background Paper 12 Clean-up of a fuel spill near Lake Dingle, Vestfold Hills) 
    • Nature – Three drums of Special Antarctic Blend (SAB) diesel were dropped from a helicopter in the catchment of Lake Dingle after being released for safety reasons.
    • Spatial extent – Approximately 600 litres of diesel were spilt creating a visible sheen on the soil surface and initially covered an area 50 x 35 meters, approximately 250 m from the northern edge of Lake Dingle. The area was mostly sandy soil and included a melt stream flowing towards the lake.
    • Intensity – Once SAB is more than about 2 cm below the soil surface it no longer evaporates but continues to dilute and spread causing a change from a high concentration of oil in a relatively small amount of soil to a lower concentration contaminating much more soil.
    • Duration – The spill occurred approximately three weeks before the winter freeze. The next spring melt would result in a pulse of fuel migrating towards the lake. If left unattended, each subsequent year the volume of contaminated soil would increase and some of the fuel would reach the lake creating a visible sheen, possibly impacting on the lake ecology, scientific values, and wildlife that may be exposed through ingestion or surface coating.
    • Reversibility – The damage was considered reversible but it was assessed that, unless a quick response was undertaken, the volume of soil to be removed and remediated would increase over time. Under these circumstances it was decided that containing and removing the most highly contaminated soil would result in the best environmental outcome, and would also be the most cost-effective strategy for limiting environmental damage. 
Thala Valley site assessment (see Background Paper 14 Assessment, monitoring and remediation of old Antarctic waste disposal sites: the Thala Valley example at Casey station)
    • Nature – A waste disposal site that was operated between 1965 and 1986 at the old Casey station contained a range of materials including ash, gravel, vehicle parts, batteries, metal, glass, plastic, paper, cardboard, wood, rope, clothing, construction materials, asbestos, cement, rubber, and drums of waste chemicals and oils.
    • Spatial extent – The waste site covered an area of approximately 3000m2, with contaminants leaching into the adjacent Brown bay.
    • Intensity – The site contained at least 2000 m3 of waste, was subject to tidal inundation, strong winds and each summer a melt stream formed causing active erosion of an estimated 4-8 m3 of contaminated material annually into Brown Bay. Investigations of the adjacent marine environment demonstrated accumulation of contaminants and impacts on seabed biota.
    • Duration – Considered to be indefinite, unless the contamination was addressed.
    • Reversibility – Some aspects of the environmental damage were considered to be reversible, through removal of the source of the contamination on land. The source of the contamination has been removed, in a controlled manner, and it is expected that over time natural sedimentation processes will cover and lock-up the contamination on the seabed and the biological communities will recover. 
    4. Standard environmental risk management processes can be applied, with due consideration to the circumstances of Antarctica
A standard environmental risk assessment and risk management process2 can be effectively applied to any situation. It involves: establishing the context; identifying risks; analyzing risks; evaluating risks; treating risks; and monitoring and review. Effective application in the circumstances of Antarctica, requires drawing on the best available knowledge of causal relationships between stressors and their effects on the Antarctic environment (e.g. how do different types and levels of pollution affect Antarctic species; are particular introduced species likely to become established/invasive in particular environments?). Uncertainty should not be a reason to delay action, although improving understanding of these causal relationships over time will assist with identifying appropriate repair and remediation actions.
Example:
Risk involves elements of both likelihood and consequence. The Antarctic Treaty Parties regularly apply an environmental risk approach to a range of situations, including through existing guidelines, such as:
    • Guidelines for Implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol, Resolution 1 (2000): Section 2.4 ‘Environmental Risk Assessment’ describes how environmental risk assessment can be used to assess whether a particular area merits protection of its special characteristics, noting that areas subject to unacceptable or unmanageable risks may need to be considered.
    • Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica, Resolution 4 (2005): Section 3.3 ‘Analysis of Impacts’ provides guidance on the identification and evaluation of adverse environmental impacts associated with proposed activities, including assessing the significance of such impacts.
    • Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Antarctica, Resolution 2 (2005): Section 2.2.1 ‘Deciding what to monitor’ discusses application of the impact assessment processes in the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica to inform the selection of monitoring indicators;
    • Guidelines for CEP Consideration of Proposals for New and Revised Designations of Antarctic Specially Protected Species under Annex II of the Protocol, Annex 8 to the CEP VIII Final Report: the procedure for listing and delisting species requires consideration of the risk of extinction of species.
    5. Objectives for repair or remediation should reflect the objectives and provisions of the Environmental Protocol, and be appropriate to Antarctic conditions
Article 3 of the Protocol establishes environmental principles that can inform objectives for actions to repair or remediate environmental damage. Depending on the circumstances, this may range along a spectrum from doing nothing (see below) to comprehensive action to ensure near complete return to the initial environmental conditions. In many cases, identifying an appropriate intermediate target level or threshold may be sufficient (e.g. not attempting to reduce pollutant levels to zero, but instead setting a target level that will ensure there are no significant adverse affects on Antarctic flora or fauna – such target levels can be identified through standard exposure-response studies widely applied in other regions).
Example:
    • As indicated in ATCM XXX/IP30, Australian research in environmental risk assessment and remediation is seeking to develop clean-up ‘trigger values’ or environmental quality standards specific to the Antarctic environment. Such standards will inform Australia’s remediation activities by assisting to prioritise contaminated sites, and will allow sites to be ‘signed-off’ as posing minimal risk to the environment and ecosystems, based on objective criteria and underpinned by scientific evidence. An updated summary of key research in the Antarctic on risk assessment tools is provided in Background Paper 13 Development of environmental quality standards for the management of contaminated sites in Antarctica.
    6. Consideration should be given to whether repair or remediation of environmental damage by any practical option will result in greater adverse environmental impact
This principle is expressed in Article 1.5(a) and Article 2.1 of Annex III, in relation to the clean up of waste disposals sites on land and abandoned works sites, and to the removal of fuel drums and other solid non-combustible wastes. It requires a comparative assessment of the likely environmental impacts if no action is taken, and the likely environmental impacts of repair and remediation options. 
Example:
The operational plans and monitoring system implemented for the clean-up of the Thala Valley waste disposal site near Casey station were designed to ensure that the activity did not result in a greater adverse environmental impact than leaving the waste material in its existing location. Prior environmental investigations had already shown that the site was having impacts on the biota in the adjacent marine environment. It was decided that removing the source material on land could be done without causing further adverse impacts but contamination already in the adjacent marine environment was best left undisturbed because the risk of causing greater adverse impacts was too great. Monitoring was done during the clean-up to provide real-time information that could be used to modify operations if additional impacts were detected. Monitoring after the clean-up was done to confirm that overall the operation did not cause additional adverse impacts (see Background Paper 14 Assessment, monitoring and remediation of old Antarctic waste disposal sites: the Thala Valley example at Casey station).
    7. Assessment of options for repair and remediation will also need to consider operational feasibility
Some relevant considerations do not relate strictly to environmental issues, although they may have a significant bearing on the ability to undertake repair or remediation action and, consequently, on the environmental outcome. As noted previously by COMNAP, these may include: 
    • Safety: can human safety be ensured when undertaking repair or remediation actions?
    • Accessibility: can the damaged area be accessed to undertake repair or remediation actions?
    • Cost: what is the monetary cost of undertaking alternative repair or remediation actions?
Example:
    • Lake Dingle is in a remote location and the assessment of clean-up options took into consideration the accessibility of the site, the impact on other planned field programs, and relative monetary costs of clean-up actions (see Background Paper 12 Clean-up of a fuel spill near Lake Dingle, Vestfold Hills). The safety of personnel during the operation was the highest priority. The contaminated soil was relocated to Davis station where it is undergoing assisted bioremediation. Management of the contaminated soil is much easier close to the station than at the spill site. The decision to bioremediate in Antarctica avoids the removal from Antarctica of soil, which is a relatively rare commodity, and eliminates the costs of shipping, treatment and disposal at a location outside Antarctica.
    8. Generally applicable standards, guidelines and techniques relevant to the Antarctic context will assist
Although responses to environmental damage will be determined on a case-by-case basis, as mentioned above, the Parties’ ability to respond effectively and in a manner consistent with the objectives and provisions of the Protocol will be enhanced by the development over time of generally applicable standards, guidelines and techniques. 
Examples:
    • The CEP Non-Native Species Manual presents general principles on responding to the introduction of a non-native species, and identifies several items of work to further develop response measures that are appropriate to Antarctic circumstances (e.g. establishing a network of experts to provide advice on responses to newly detected species; considering the preparation of a rapid response guideline, and developing guidance for responses to disease events).
    • Working Paper 21 An Antarctic Clean-Up Manual proposes the development of resources for use by Parties, as guidance where appropriate, to assist in addressing the clean-up obligations under Annex III to the Protocol.
    • Background Paper 11 Clean-up Techniques for Antarctica outlines the options for clean-up that are available and have been used successfully in Antarctica.
    • Background Paper 13 Development of environmental quality standards for the management of contaminated sites in Antarctica proposes the development of Antarctic-specific environmental quality standards, based on the sensitivity of Antarctic species and communities to specific contaminants (such as from ecotoxicological studies), to be used as environmental trigger values for prioritising clean-up and as environmental quality targets for determining when clean-up is sufficient to protect local ecosystems.
