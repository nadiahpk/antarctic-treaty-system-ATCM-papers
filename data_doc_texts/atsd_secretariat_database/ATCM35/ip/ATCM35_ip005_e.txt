Report Submitted to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXXV by the Depositary Government for the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in Accordance with Recommendation XIII-2, Paragraph 2(D)
Submitted by the United Kingdom

This report covers events regarding the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) for the reporting year 1 March 2010 to 28 February 2011.  
The summary at Annex A lists all capturing and killing of Antarctic seals by Contracting Parties to CCAS during the reporting period.  A report of events in the 2011 – 2012 year will be submitted to ATCM XXXVI, once the June 2012 deadline for exchange of information has passed. 
The United Kingdom would like to remind Contracting Parties to CCAS that the reporting period for the Exchange of Information is from 1 March to the end of February each year. The reporting period was changed to the above dates during the September 1988 Meeting to Review the Operation of the Convention. This is documented in Paragraph 19(a) of the Report of that Meeting. 
The Exchange of Information, referred to in Paragraph 6(a) in the Annex to the Convention, should be submitted to other Contracting Parties and to SCAR by 30 June each year, including nil returns. The UK would like to thank all Contracting Parties to CCAS for providing this information in time to enable the UK to submit a complete report to ATCM XXXV.  The UK would, however, continue to encourage all Contracting Parties to CCAS to submit returns by the 30 June deadline to ensure that all relevant information has been provided.
Since ATCM XXXIII, there have been no accessions to CCAS. However, the UK understands that Pakistan wishes to accede to the Convention. In line with the provisions of Article 12, the UK will seek the consent of the Contracting Parties to invite Pakistan to accede. A list of countries which were original signatories to the Convention, and countries which have subsequently acceded is attached to this report (Annex B).
