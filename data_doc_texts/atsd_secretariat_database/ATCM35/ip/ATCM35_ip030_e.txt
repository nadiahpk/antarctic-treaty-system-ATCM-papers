The Final Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) for the Proposed Exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth, Antarctica 
An Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Background
The United Kingdom is planning a programme of scientific exploration at Subglacial Lake Ellsworth, Antarctica.  
A draft CEE for the proposed exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth was presented to the CEP at ATCM XXXIV in Buenos Aires, 2011, (see Working Paper ATCM XXXIV / WP 016 and Information Paper ATCM XXXIV / IP 102) and had been subject to intersessional review (see Working Paper ATCM XXXIV / WP 014).
The CEP concluded that the draft CEE generally conformed to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Environmental Protocol, that the information contained within it supports the conclusions that the proposed activity will have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, and that the proposed activity is justified on the basis of the global scientific importance and value to be gained by the exploration of Lake Ellsworth.  

Final CEE
The final CEE for the proposed exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth has been prepared and is available for download from http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ellsworthcee and is attached to this Information Paper. 
When preparing the final CEE,  the UK considered,  and where appropriate addressed,  the useful comments received on the Draft CEE from Australia,  Norway,  United States, France,  Russia,  Germany,  Netherlands,  ASOC,  New Zealand and the CEP.  Appendix 4 of the Final CEE sets out how these comments were handled.
The final CEE also provides some updated information such as the confirmed logistical arrangements and further clarity on the assessment of potential impacts associated with the Programme's contractor.  The CEE also includes an update on minor changes to the equipment design, manufacture and trials, and the final selection of the microbial control method for each item of equipment.  These are minor changes which typically relate to the inclusion of additional detail (compared to that included in the draft CEE) and do not affect the level of environmental mitigation afforded by the equipment or microbial control techniques to be deployed.
