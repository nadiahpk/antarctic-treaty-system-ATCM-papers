Contemporary opportunities for weather and related Polar Observations, Research and Services - leading to improved mitigation of risk
(An Information Paper for Agenda Item 5 (Operation of the Antarctic Treaty System: General Matters) of ATCM XXXV: 
submitted by
the World Meteorological Organization 
Executive Council (Panel of Experts on) Polar Observations, Research, and Services1)

Summary
The Executive Council (Panel of Experts on) Polar Observations, Research and Services (EC‑PORS) is the body within WMO which has responsibility for WMO Polar Activities. 
The purpose of this Information Paper is to draw to the attention of Members of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) present-day opportunities in the area of meteorological (and related) observations, research and services, resulting from the work of EC‑PORS, and related agencies/institutions. 

Opportunities for collaboration in Polar Meteorological Observations, Research and Services have never been so good
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Congress XVI recognized the importance of the relationship between WMO and the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and strongly encouraged the WMO’s Executive Council to work with the ATCM on issues of mutual responsibility2.
It is also recognised within WMO ‘polar circles’ that there is a wide range of groups, agencies and commissions that contribute to the welfare of people operating in polar areas, or who seek to assess the impact of polar regions on global weather and climate. There is therefore, a strong focus within the WMO polar community on engagement, not only within the WMO system, but also with the broader global services, operations, and research communities.
The purpose of this Information Paper is to draw to the attention of Members of ATCM contemporary opportunities in mitigating risks to people and property in the Antarctic through improved environmental intelligence comprising high southern‑latitude meteorological (and related phenomena) observations (data); research; and services (including products such as weather forecasts).
What is EC-PORS?
The International Polar Year 2007–2008 (IPY) produced many outcomes, one of which was a decision by WMO Congress XV to subsume the pre‑existing WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology into a group which focussed relevant outcomes in the polar regions of both hemispheres — this new group is the Executive Council (Panel of Experts on) Polar Observations, Research and Services (EC‑PORS).
EC‑PORS is the body within the WMO which has responsibility for WMO Polar Activities3 and is the entry point for all who seek to collaborate with WMO on polar matters. The aim is to bring observations, research and services together to provide WMO, and its partners, the maximum value for their investments in polar regions spanning the Antarctic; the Arctic; and the “Third Pole” (the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, and other appropriate high (ice and snow covered) mountain regions4). 
Panel Members
EC‑PORS is composed of experts nominated by WMO member countries, including parties to the Antarctic Treaty, that have active meteorological, hydrological and cryospheric programmes in polar regions. Experts from the following 18 countries currently participate in EC‑PORS: Argentina; Australia; Canada; Chile; China; Finland; France; Germany; Iceland; India; Italy; New Zealand; Norway; Republic of Korea; Russian Federation; South Africa; Sweden; United Kingdom (UK); and the United States (USA). The European Space Agency also has membership status via The Netherlands. Other countries may join EC‑PORS as appropriate.
EC‑PORS, the Antarctic, and the ATCM
Within EC‑PORS, an Antarctic Task Team (ATT) advises the wider group on technical matters (coordination and standardization) for the area south of 60°S. For general scientific matters, and related observational and services issues, the outer boundary of the ATT purview may extend northward over the oceans to include sub‑Antarctic islands and seas, always mindful though, of the interests of WMO Member states within the relevant WMO Regional Associations.
WMO Congress XVI Resolution 11.9/45 sets out guidelines for WMO Polar activities, and requests EC‑PORS to, among other matters:
    • “Promote the coordination of weather, climate, water and related environmental activities in Polar Regions”; and to,
    •  “Ensure close collaboration with other international organizations concerned such as the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM)……….....” (and others such as those mentioned  in the ‘objectives’ below).
Objectives identified for EC‑PORS in its Terms of Reference (ToR)6 include, among others:
    • To ensure that operational and research observing networks in polar regions (including Antarctic Observing Network (AntON7)) are integrated within the framework of the WMO Integrated Global Observing System8 (WIGOS) and WMO Information System9 (WIS) and are enhanced to include cryosphere-related variables;
    • To engage in a concerted effort to involve WMO Members, technical commissions and regional associations, as well as relevant research and international organizations and bodies, in improving predictive capability in polar regions on timescales from hours to centuries;
    • To guide the development of the Global Cryosphere Watch and the Global Integrated Polar Prediction System;
    • To facilitate the acquisition, exchange and archiving of observational data from polar regions in compliance with WIGOS requirements related to instruments, data exchange (WIS) and the Quality Management Framework (QMF), and to underpin the provision of services required for safe operations in the polar regions;
    • To provide regular input on issues related to polar meteorology, hydrology, oceanography and the cryosphere to support the activities of relevant groups or bodies, such as the Scientific Committees for the World Climate Research Programme10 (WCRP), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), the Global Atmosphere Watch programme (GAW) and The Observing system Research and Predictability Experiment of the World Weather Research Programme11 (WWRP/THORPEX); ………., the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR); Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP); the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), and WMO technical commissions, regional associations and programmes, including the World Climate Programme (WCP). 
Outcomes sought by EC‑PORS
The work of EC‑PORS is Services-driven
Using the WMO Congress XVI ToR framework, ‘Services’ are the key driver of EC‑PORS: in other words, EC‑PORS aims to ensure that weather; climate; and sea ice risks to people and assets located in polar regions are being satisfactorily mitigated by access to relevant data, information and services. Moreover, it is almost axiomatic that research and development underpins progress in service delivery in the 21st Century! Accordingly EC‑PORS is currently concentrating its efforts on, among other matters:
    • contributing to the development of a Global Integrated Polar Prediction System (GIPPS) that delivers service‑focused products for polar regions to mitigate risks to people working in these areas;
    • creating a Global Cryospheric Watch (CGW) under which observations of the cryosphere (including the “Third Pole”) are made globally in a systematic manner in order to better monitor and characterise the effects of a changing environment on the Earth's frozen water;
    • developing the potential for a Polar Regional Climate Centres in the development of the implementation strategy, substructures and governance model of the Global Framework for Climate Services12 (GFCS);
    • engaging partners who might contribute to, or benefit from the above initiatives. 
To these ends, one work in progress is that, over the first half of 2012‑13, international stakeholders will be given the opportunity to define their interests in joint planning of activities regarding an International Polar Initiative, a medium to long term (~decadal) focus on polar issues, replacing the International Polar Decade (IPD) concept13). Another activity of EC‑PORS is closely consulting by way of surveys, in seeking stakeholder requirements for service improvements: for example, members of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO)14 have been asked for their requirements for services and products relating to sea ice and other environmental factors.
A little more on GIPPS
In the title Global Integrated Polar Prediction System, “Global” reflects that this involves not only an international effort, but that the polar‑regions themselves affect systems (weather, climate, hydrological, biological, chemical, etc.) globally. “Integrated” reflects the interconnections between these systems. Moreover, GIPPS itself will be based on the principles of research, observations and services that are integrated and aligned.
EC‑PORS notes that the best way forward with GIPPS is for the development of one plan shared by WMO’s WWRP and WCRP, ideally led by one International Planning Office (IPO).
Three distinct time scales are envisioned for GIPPS: 
    • short (hours to months) – the focus of the WWRP-THORPEX polar initiatives15;
    • medium (years to decades) – the focus of WCRP; and, 
    • long term (in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sense) of ice sheet mass balance and sea level for the next few centuries.
Partnerships and Engagement 
As mentioned, there is a strong focus within EC‑PORS in maintaining engagement, not only within the WMO system, but with the broader global services, operations, and research communities. A summary of some of the potential partners in this work is as follows:
    • ATCM; COMNAP; SCAR; and IAATO;
    • WMO Programmes such as WWRP and WCRP;
    • WMO technical commissions, such as the Joint WMO/Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) Expert Team on Sea Ice (JCOMM‑ETSI);
    • The International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG)16;
    • International operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) centres such as the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) along with the NWP centres of WMO Members states;
    • The Antarctic Meteorological Observation Modeling Forecasting Workshop (AMOMFW) community17;
    • International research centres such as the Byrd Polar Research Center18 
ATCM and the global effort into improving weather and related services for the Antarctic
WMO, through EC‑PORS, greatly appreciates the invitation from ATCM to be involved in providing guidance on ATCM recommendations relating to operational matters around meteorological and related environmental concerns, and separately, around questions of on Antarctic Tourism. Through participating in the ACTM Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) process, EC‑PORS notes, for example, that there are eight recommendations to analyse under this category, and in its opinion, all of these would benefit from consolidation, following in-depth review.
WMO/EC‑PORS would, therefore, welcome being part of a team, including, for example, COMNAP, SCAR, and other relevant WMO identities such as JCOMM‑ETSI, to consider current arrangements for cooperation in the collection and exchange of meteorological data and services, and to present, via the ICG process, a summary of contemporary requirements to the ATCM XXXVI for consideration.
