Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 109 Moe Island, South Orkney Islands
A working paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has undertaken a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No.109 Moe Island, South Orkney Islands.  In submitting this revised Plan, the United Kingdom recommends that the CEP ask the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans to undertake an intersessional review and to report back to CEP XVI.
Background
The primary reason for the designation of Moe Island, South Orkney Islands (Latitude 60°44' S, Longitude 45°41' W), as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area is to protect environmental values, and primarily the terrestrial flora and fauna within the Area.  

The Area was originally designated in Recommendation IV-13 (1966, SPA No. 13) after a proposal by the United Kingdom on the grounds that the Area provided a representative sample of the maritime Antarctic ecosystem, that intensive experimental research on the neighbouring Signy Island might alter its ecosystem and that Moe Island should be specially protected as a control area for future comparison.

Following a visit to the ASPA in February 2011, the values specified in the earlier designation were reaffirmed.  These values are set out as follows:
    • The Area contains exceptional environmental values associated with the biological composition and diversity of a near-pristine example of the maritime Antarctic terrestrial and littoral marine ecosystems. 
    • Moe Island contains the greatest continuous expanses of Chorisodontium-Polytrichum moss turf found in the Antarctic.
The revised plan is attached for the consideration of the CEP (Annex 1).  The proposed revision includes the following major changes to the provisions of the existing Management Plan:
    • The text has been redrafted into the format recommended in the ‘Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ [Resolution 2 (2011)]
    • Introduction.  An introduction has been added that describes the primary reasons for the Area’s designation as an ASPA and the contribution of the Area to the Antarctic protected areas system.  The Area’s position within the framework of the ‘Environmental Domains Analysis for the Antarctic Continent’ has been described [Resolution 3 (2008)].
    • Section 6(ii) Access to the Area.  This section has been added and includes information on possible access routes to the Area and restrictions on helicopter overflights, in accordance with the ‘Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds’ contained in Resolution 2 (2004).
    • 6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features. Text describing the boundary of the Area has been altered to enhance clarity.
Recommendation
Given that the Management Plan for ASPA No.109 Moe Island, South Orkney Islands has been amended, the United Kingdom recommends that the CEP ask the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans to undertake a more detailed intersessional review of the revised Plan and report back to CEP XVI.
