Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting Communiqué
Summary
Australia proposes that the Consultative Parties decide to issue at the conclusion of each meeting a short, factual report, or ‘communiqué’, comprising a summary of matters discussed and decisions taken. This would improve awareness among the general public and other international bodies of the unique features of Antarctica and the Antarctic Treaty system, and of the important work undertaken during the annual meetings of Parties to the Antarctic Treaty and the Environmental Protocol.
Background
The Consultative Parties have highlighted the importance of effective outreach in ensuring broad recognition of the special qualities and global significance of the Antarctic region, and of the governance and management framework for activities within the Antarctic Treaty area. For example:
    • in the 2009 Washington Ministerial Declaration on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty the Consultative Parties undertook ‘to promote education and outreach programmes to enhance global understanding and commitment to protecting the Antarctic environment’;
    • in discussion at ATCM XXXII (2009) of a strategic planning approach to the work of the ATCM, it was suggested that the ATCM should expand outreach programmes to make the general public and other international bodies aware of the unique features of Antarctica and the Antarctic Treaty system; and
    • the 2011 Declaration on Antarctic Cooperation on the Occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Entry into Force of the Antarctic Treaty reaffirmed the Consultative Parties’ intention to enhance ‘understanding in the wider community – including academia, decision makers and the general public – of the significance of international cooperation under the Antarctic Treaty system, its operation and the global importance of scientific research in Antarctica’.
Outreach presently occurs through a variety of channels, including through the website of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, the public release of meeting documents when each meeting has concluded, the availability of ATCM Final Reports, and through materials generated by the Parties and Observers that attend the ATCM. However, the Final Report of the ATCM is, for understandable technical reasons, generally not available until several months after the meeting. Similarly, the report style and format is well tailored to the needs of the Parties, but may not lend itself to general ease of use for an outside audience. As a result, there is no timely and readily accessible account of the discussions and decisions of the ATCM.
Proposal
As the ATCM is the highest-level international forum responsible for the protection and management of the Antarctic region, it would be beneficial to adopt an enhanced mechanism for communicating meeting outcomes. The release of a short (~2 page) report – or communiqué – at the conclusion of each ATCM would be a simple but useful means of outreach to all audiences interested in the Antarctic region. An ATCM communiqué could summarise in plain language the main matters discussed and decisions taken. A draft communiqué could be developed during the course of the meeting, possibly by the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) in consultation as appropriate with the Host Country Secretariat, drawing on extracts from the reports of the Working Groups and Committee for Environmental Protection, for endorsement by the final Plenary. It could then be made public via the ATS website, and appended to the Final Report.
Recommendation
Australia recommends that the Consultative Parties decide to adopt and publicly release at the conclusion of each ATCM, a communiqué representing a concise summary of matters discussed and decisions taken by the Meeting, as outlined above. A draft Decision is provided at Attachment A.

Draft Decision XX

Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting Communiqué

The Representatives,

Recalling the 2009 Washington Ministerial Declaration on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty which recorded the Consultative Parties’ commitment to promote education and outreach programmes to enhance global understanding and commitment to protecting the Antarctic environment’;
Recalling also the 2011 Declaration on Antarctic Cooperation on the Occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Entry into Force of the Antarctic Treaty, which reaffirmed the Consultative Parties’ intention to enhance understanding in the wider community – including academia, decision makers and the general public – of the significance of international cooperation under the Antarctic Treaty system, its operation and the global importance of scientific research in Antarctica;
Recalling the longstanding practice of making the documents submitted to each Consultative Meeting publicly available after the close of the meeting, provided no Delegation has indicated its intention to the contrary when submitting a document, as most recently reflected in Resolution 5 (1998); 
Conscious of the value of increasing public knowledge of the achievements and operation of the Antarctic Treaty system;
Welcoming the work by the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat to maintain and update its website, which represents a valuable source of information about the Antarctic region and the Antarctic Treaty system;
Desiring to ensure the public availability of a timely and readily accessible account of the matters considered by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting;

Decide:
    1) to adopt at the conclusion of each Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting an ATCM Communiqué,  comprising a concise, plain language report on the key matters discussed and decided by the Meeting; and
    2) to task the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with making the ATCM Communiqué publicly available via its website as soon as possible following each Meeting.
