Exchange of real time information of the maritime traffic in Antarctica
Summary
This document seeks to generate a reflection on the growing challenges generated by the increased numbers of vessels operating in Antarctic waters and to propose a real time exchanging information system of the maritime traffic in Antarctica.
Background
Each year more fishing vessels, passenger vessels, state ships and, mostly, tourism yachts operate in Antarctica. Many of these ships are part of organizations such as IAATO, or have some kind of control by the flag they host, making it possible to know their position, but not in real time. 
Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres (MRCCs) with responsibility in Antarctica (Argentina, Australia, Chile, South Africa, and New Zealand) have assumed that the ships voluntarily provide their position and intention of navigation reports, with the aim of facilitating assistance in the event of an incident.
The amount of vessels and passengers traveling to and from Antarctica in different seasons of the year, especially during summer, is extremely high. Therefore, thousands of people are part of the “floating population” of this Continent, which is a continuous concern for the Maritime Search and Rescue Services, especially for Chile, since is one of the closest country.
In attention to the above, we consider that is an urgent need to have a real time communications system, 24/7, to establish an effective exchange of information between the 5 MRCC with responsibilities of Search and Rescue (SAR) in Antarctica.
The Chilean system
The Directorate of Maritime Safety, Security and Operations, as part of the MRCC Chile, has a “C4 Room,” which intention is to monitor, analyze, and supervise the activity that takes place in the maritime space of national responsibility, with the aim of contributing in alerting, preventing, protecting and giving an adequate response to environmental protection and safety situations that affect human life at sea.
Among the objectives of the “C4 Room,” there is sharing of maritime information with external, national and international, organisms, according to the subscribed agreements.
To fulfill its tasks, the MRCC Chile has personnel on duty 24/7 and uses the following communication equipment: 

        ◦ Phone number		: 	56 - 32 - 2208639
        ◦ Phone number		: 	56 - 32 - 2208638
        ◦ Phone number		: 	56 - 32 - 2208637
        ◦ Fax number	   	:	56 - 32 - 2208662
        ◦ E-mail   	  	:	mrccchile@directemar.cl
        ◦ IRIDIUM number	:	8816 5141 4461
        ◦ INMARSAT number	:	8707 7239 3444	

There are also “web pages” that allow organizations to communicate in real time to share information. One of them is APAN (All Partners Access Network). This website allows the information exchange and the effective cooperation by creating a communication network through pre-established channels. It is a forum to share lessons learned and to develop best practices, including responses to emergencies, humanitarian aids, support to natural disasters, aspects related to the safety of navigation, long distance exercises, conferences, “table top” events, etc. 
Among the benefits of the system, there is the possibility to reduce the response times for specific situations, ensuring the confidentiality of the information received. 
Actions/benefits are the following:
    • Profiles: It allows users to see the information by themselves and allows connecting users based on interests and experience.
    • Search / tags: Find the information using the search or tag function of the APAN.
    • Blogs: It creates web registers editable by the group owners and managers that eases the communication between the group and its members.
    • Forum: Discuss the topics or ask questions and give answers in online discussion areas.
    • Wikis: Collaborate with different authors to create and edit the content of the web pages.
    • Gallery: View and download documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF), images and videos.
    • Live Chat: Group and Peer to Peer chat capabilities that allow real time group or one-to-one collaboration.
    • Low broadband / Mobile Accessibility: View and publish contents like blogs, forum and files from limited broadband places or from a mobile device.
    • SIG Capabilities and visualization of  Geotag GEO content, RSS sources, and KML / KMZ overlaps, using the APAN Map Widget.
    • Calendar: Calendar of events and community or group visualization.
    • Integrated E-mail: External APAN mail.org mail account.
    • Documents Library / personalized lists: Integrated documents libraries and personalized lists that allow a more structured information exchange.
    • Software Integration: Flexibility platform to join with the existing capabilities.
    • Google Analytics: Monitoring the community and group participation and activity through the social analysis and the Web.
Recommendations
In view of the analyzed information, the following is suggested:
    a) It is necessary to work on a communications system, maybe depending from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat or implemented by MRCC with Antarctic SAR responsibilities, that allows real time information exchange. This would help to recognize, in real time, capabilities, features, and amount of people on board each vessel, differentiating from crew and passengers of the boats that navigate to and from Antarctic.
    b)  The communications system must encourage the ships to make all the efforts to inform and keep the real time information updated. To ensure confidence in the system, it is essential to guaranty the confidentiality of the information exchanged.
    c) All the previous will allow the Maritime Search and Rescue Services to keep a real and reliable surface picture (ship, cargo, people) in order to improve the decision-making processes to deploy promptly reactions to emergency situations.
