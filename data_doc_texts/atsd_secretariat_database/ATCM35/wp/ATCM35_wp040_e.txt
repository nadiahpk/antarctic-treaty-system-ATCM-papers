Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay, Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea
    1. Italy and the United States have identified a part of northern Terra Nova Bay that meets criteria for designation as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area under Annex V to the Protocol, which seeks to include within the protected area system “…areas with important or unusual assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native birds or mammals…” and “…areas of particular interest to on-going or planned scientific research”.
    2. Following a review of the scientific literature, consultation with a range of scientists who have carried out research in the area for many years, and after discussions amongst national programs operating in the local region, a possible boundary has been identified for consideration at Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay (see Map 1, Appendix A). The proposed Area is 281.7 km2, of which the marine component is ~275.5 km2 (98 %) and the terrestrial component is 6.2 km2 (2 %)
    3. The proposed Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay ASPA is situated in the northern part of Terra Nova Bay between Campbell Glacier Tongue and Cape Washington, where fast ice regularly persists (Map 1). One of the largest emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies in Antarctica is located at Cape Washington (Barber-Meyer et al. 2008). A rich Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) ‘nursery’ has been identified in the area surrounding the Campbell Glacier Tongue (Guglielmo et al. 1998; Vacchi et al. 2004; Granata et al. 2009; Vacchi et al. 2012a&b), and the eastern part of the embayment across to Cape Washington has accordingly been named Silverfish Bay. More recent observations have shown large numbers of Pleuragramma eggs under sea-ice between Cape Washington and Oscar Point, indicating that the spatial distribution and abundance of fish eggs is subject to annual fluctuations, and also includes sea ice close to Cape Washington (Vacchi pers. comm. 2012).
    4. Large groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and other cetaceans such as Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) are regularly observed foraging in this area (Lauriano et al. 2010), as well as Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx) seals (Kooyman et al. 1990; Burns & Kooyman 2001). The embayment is an important haul-out and breeding area for Weddell seals, several hundred of which typically congregate along sea ice leads and openings that dynamically form in the embayment throughout the season (Kooyman et al.1990; La Rue pers. comm. 2012). A south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) colony is located on the ice-free slopes of Cape Washington, overlooking the emperor colony, and snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) have been recorded as breeding in niches in the Cape Washington cliffs (Greenfield & Smellie 1992). The region is of considerable scientific interest, with a long time-series of data for the Cape Washington emperor colony in particular, and has also been of interest to tourist and media expeditions.
    5. An important point in this proposal is that the site has exceptional value for observations of the interactions and predator / prey relationships between many different members of the marine ecosystem within a relatively compact area that is accessible to scientists supported by nearby research stations. The boundaries were defined to ensure that all components of the local ecosystem were included within the ASPA.
    6. The proposed boundary covers the marine area between Campbell Glacier Tongue and Cape Washington, and also includes the southern part of the Cape Washington peninsula to encompass all cliffs and rock outcrops that host snow petrel and south polar skua colonies. The boundary includes the breeding area of the emperor colony, which shifts throughout the season over an area up to six kilometres principally to the west and north of Cape Washington. The proposed boundary includes Silverfish Bay, where elevated concentrations of silverfish eggs and larvae have been observed. 
    7. Consideration was given to designing a boundary that included more of the foraging range of emperor penguins, although because this extends many hundreds of kilometers across the Ross Sea, this was not considered practical for the type of protected area being considered in this case. Moreover, protection for the wider Ross Sea region is currently under consideration within CCAMLR. The proposal for a more limited Cape Washington ASPA is viewed as complementary to these initiatives although more focused on specific values at this site and more local, practical management issues.
    8. The proposed eastern boundary is the 165° 25' E line of longitude extending 1.8 km south from Cape Washington. This line was determined in part on a pragmatic basis, since it extends from the prominent visual feature of Cape Washington itself, while is also easy for ship and aircraft pilots to identify on charts.  The southern boundary is proposed as the line of latitude at 74° 40' S, which is also easy to identify on charts. The southern extent of the Campbell Glacier Tongue was considered as a boundary reference, however this was rejected because the glacier tongue undergoes frequent fluctuations and some Treaty Parties have found it difficult to agree to protected area boundaries that are dynamic on relatively short time-scales. These pragmatic boundaries based on lines of latitude and longitude, and on the coastline, are considered sufficient to encompass the primary values under consideration for the protected area.
    9. It is recognized that the emperor colony has traditionally attracted interest for tourism, with an average of ~200 tourists visiting Cape Washington per annum over the last decade. The boundaries proposed would reduce the area available for tourism, although should not exclude the opportunity for a high-quality tourist experience at the site. Tour ships could approach the ice edge outside the proposed boundary and see much in regard to bird and mammal activity, with close-ups of an emperor colony potentially available elsewhere.
    10. The protected area designation aims to ensure that the outstanding values of the site are maintained in the context of a combination of scientific, logistic and tourism activities in the region. The boundaries focus on a relatively compact area that hosts an important and unusually large and outstanding emperor penguin colony, a particularly rich silverfish spawning area, and on a site with a range of associated species and where observations have been made of a high level of predator / prey interactions.
    11. The proposed boundaries are designed to avoid potential constraints on ship movements providing support to nearby research stations (Mario Zucchelli (Italy), Gondwana (Germany), and Jang Bogo (under construction by the Republic of Korea)), but offering sufficient protection of the important values of the area.
    12. Although fishing is not being carried out within the marine area proposed for designation as an ASPA, the proponents consider that the proposal could be of interest to CCAMLR in view of the size of the marine component, the importance of the first documented nursery area for the Antarctic silverfish P. antarcticum, and the relevance of the proposal in the context of broader discussions taking place within the CCAMLR forum about mechanisms for protection of the Ross Sea marine environment more generally. The proponents would therefore propose forwarding the proposed draft plan for consideration by CCAMLR.
    13. Italy and the United States have prepared the draft ASPA Management Plan and maps annexed to this paper for consideration by the CEP.
