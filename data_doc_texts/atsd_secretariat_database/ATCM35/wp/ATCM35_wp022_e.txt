Environmental Aspects and Impacts of Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in Antarctica
Summary

Tourism management in Antarctica has been on the agenda of the ATCM for some time.  To date no assessment of potential or actual environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism has been undertaken despite ongoing expressions of concern over the issue.  New Zealand has led a comprehensive study on the environmental aspects and impacts of tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica.  A summary of the findings of the study is presented in this Working Paper.  The study is presented under Information Paper 33.

CEP XV is invited to consider the study and: endorse it and forward it to ATCM XXXV; or request New Zealand to forward the study to ATCM XXXV as a single author study, or put in place arrangements to further develop the study ahead of CEP XVI.


Background
At CEP XII Australia, France and New Zealand outlined a proposal for the CEP to undertake a study on the environmental aspects and impacts of Antarctic tourism and non-governmental activities.  The rationale for undertaking this work was:
    • The ATCM’s interest in the results of this and other relevant work to support its consideration of tourism management (ATCM XXXI Final Report (203));
    • Recognition that the issue of cumulative impacts of tourism has been raised several times in both the CEP and the ATCM (ATCM XXXI Final Report (206));

The objectives of the study are to:
    • Provide a status report on Antarctic tourism and non-governmental activities as a baseline from which to view future change;
    • Provide an independent assessment of actual and potential environmental impacts of tourism;
    • Identify and where possible assess the effectiveness of existing management controls;
    • Identify relevant research and monitoring activities and the outcomes and findings of such projects;
    • Identify new analytical methods or approaches to analyzing existing data and information; and
    • Where appropriate, make recommendations for the future management of the environmental aspects of Antarctic tourism activities.

CEP XII endorsed the proposal and accepted New Zealand’s offer to lead the work.
A progress report was provided to CEP XIII indicating the challenges that had been encountered in gathering and utilising relevant data and information.  Business disruptions in New Zealand due to the earthquakes further delayed submission of the report from CEP XIV to CEP XV.

The Tourism Study is in Information Paper 33.
Introduction

The issue of tourism management in Antarctica has been consistently on the ATCM’s agenda since 1966.  It has had its own ATCM Working Group since 2004 and has been the subject of two Meetings of Experts.

The Antarctic Treaty Parties have frequently expressed concern over the environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism.  See for example, Recommendation XVI-13 (1991), Recommendation XVIII-1 (1994), para 57 of the Final Report of ATXM XVIII (1994), para 93 of the Final Report of ATCM XXI (1997), para 195 of the Final Report of ATCM XXVII (2004), as well as references in the 50th Anniversary (Baltimore) Declaration.

Alongside these concerns the Parties have considered (though not implemented) a range of possible management responses including, inter alia, improved and centralised data management (paras 165 – 167 of the Final Report of ATCM XXVII) and monitoring programmes (paras 92 – 95 of ATCM XXI).

However, the long-standing discussions within Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings have not been supported by readily available data and information on the actual or potential impacts of Antarctic tourism.

Study findings

The intent of conducting the tourism study has been to fill this void and to provide for the Parties an independent assessment of the actual or potential environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism.  As a consequence it is anticipated that the Parties will be able to take an informed view as to the expediency and necessity of any future management interventions.

The study provides:

    • an overview of tourism trends over time;
    • an overview of the current status and characteristics of Antarctic tourism;
    • a consideration of the potential environmental impacts that could arise from Antarctic tourism;
    • a review of the sites that are visited by tourists and the state of knowledge of those sites;
    • a review of the published literature on the impacts of Antarctic tourism;
    • a summary of regulatory measures adopted by the Treaty Parties on tourism;
    • an assessment of regulatory controls in place against the identified environmental aspects of Antarctic tourism;
    • recommendations for further work.

Notable observations from the study are:

    • Independent, reliable and complete data on all forms of Antarctic tourism are hard to obtain.  While the industry, through IAATO, manages and reports on data for the majority of tourism activities, there are substantial gaps in the data and the ATCM has no ownership of them.  The lack of comprehensive data and information readily available to the ATCM makes any assessment of the environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism challenging.  This situation is likely to continue unless reliable means of collecting and reporting on tourism data are established.

    • To date no methodology has been agreed by the Treaty Parties to distinguish between tourist sites in terms of their relative environmental sensitivities.  A more thorough and quantifiable assessment of relative site sensitivities would provide a firmer basis for site-specific management.

    • Information on tourist site sensitivities is not held centrally; the state of knowledge is highly variable between sites and is not readily available to managers and the CEP / ATCM. 

    • The published literature contains very few studies of environmental impacts specific to Antarctic tourism.  In some instances unequivocal environmental impacts have occurred; for example the formation of tracks through moss beds on Aitcho Island, and tracking at other locations. For the most part however, the literature suggests that tourism impacts are either absent (i.e. tourism is having no affect on local physical or biological systems), or any impacts are subtle and cumulative and undetectable at the current (low) levels of monitoring.  

    • There is currently no ATCM-agreed systematic means to monitor impacts from tourism activity at tourist sites.  Feedback on impacts and the adequacy of current management controls is currently provided by the industry itself and a US-based NGO, Oceanites.

    • The effectiveness of implementation of current tourism management controls, including EIA provisions of the Protocol, have not been thoroughly assessed to date.  

    • There may be merit in considering a range of future scenarios for Antarctic tourism and the associated environmental implications and potential management responses.  This should include consideration of additional pressures being faced in the region; not least the effects of a changing Antarctic climate which is having, and is likely to continue to have a far more significant impact on natural systems.

    • There are a number of management options available to the ATCM including hard (ASPA and ASMA designations) as well as soft measures such as site-specific and generic guidance material.  The utility of these tools and other management options (e.g. seasonal and site-specific management) requires further consideration.  Evidence for the application of one or a combination of such approaches will need to take account of limited data, monitoring and research. 

Study recommendations (to be further reviewed by CEP XV)
Recommendation 1:
To ensure that the ATCM has readily available to it a complete picture of tourism activities and to facilitate regular assessments of the environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism by the ATCM, the ATCM should develop a centrally managed database of tourism activities, which might be achieved through a redesign and concerted use of the EIES.  

Consideration will need to be given as to the data required, though much of the information currently collected through the post-visit reporting process would be of relevance, supplemented with accurate reporting of all authorised tourist activities including yacht visits and land-based expeditions.
Recommendation 2:
To improve site-specific management a centrally managed ATCM database of tourist sites, including information on their environmental sensitivities, should be established, alongside the visitation database referred to in Recommendation 1.
Recommendation 3:  
An appropriate method of assessing site sensitivity should be developed and a relative sensitivity analysis undertaken for at least the most heavily visited sites in Antarctica, including, for example, consideration of the vulnerability of tourist sites to non-native species establishment, for the purpose of more rigorously assessing appropriate management needs.  Site sensitivity considerations should also be included in the Environmental Impact Assessment process for tourism activities.
Recommendation 4: 
Consideration should be given to the means by which site specific guidelines are reviewed and updated, including the appropriate frequency of review and the information required to support a review.  

Recommendation 5:
Consideration should be given to the regular review of trends in tourist activity at selected tourist sites, particularly those with high levels of visitation or those considered to be particularly sensitive to impact.


Recommendation 6:
Consideration should be given to establishing an ATCM-approved on-site monitoring programme for the purposes of i) assessing the effectiveness of site-specific guidelines and ii) monitoring for impacts.
Recommendation 7:
Consideration should be given to developing a series of ‘best estimate’ trigger levels to assist in guiding monitoring efforts. This could include identifying certain parameters (e.g. the number of landed tourists per season at a site) that would, if reached, trigger a need for a review of the effectiveness of current management at the site. Such an approach would be underpinned by the site sensitivity analysis referred to in Recommendation 3 above.

Recommendation 8:
Consideration should be given to identifying a range of potential management options that might be applied to managing tourism activities, including vessels and vessel operations while transporting tourists, as well as to the data and information needed to support the application of such measures.


Recommendation to the CEP
In light of comments received on an earlier draft of this Working Paper and on the tourism study itself, New Zealand recommends that CEP XV critically reviews the study and its observations and recommendations, and identifies a preferred course of action including from the following options:
    a) CEP XV endorses the study and forwards it to ATCM XXXV to support the ATCM’s consideration of tourism management;
    b) CEP XV requests New Zealand to table the study as a single author study for further consideration by ATCM XXXV;
    c) CEP XV decides to further develop the study ahead of CEP XVI and puts in place arrangements to take forward the work.
