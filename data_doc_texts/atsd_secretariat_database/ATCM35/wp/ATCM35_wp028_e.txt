Jurisdiction in Antarctica
(Updated version only in English)

During the 34th ATCM, France presented a follow-up on judicial procedures initiated in connection with the damages caused to the Wordie House hut by French nationals (WP11). At that time, France had noted difficulties for French courts to rely on evidence and testimonies collected in Antarctica by persons not legally entitled to do so by the French authorities. France had proposed to provide the 35th ATCM a working paper on the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica, on the basis of article IX.1.e of the Treaty1. This document aims to present difficulties regarding jurisdiction, already encountered or potential, and to propose to the ATCM to initiate, if it considers it appropriate, a discussion on these difficulties.

    1) Offenses likely to be committed in Antarctica

Two kinds of offenses are likely to be committed in Antarctica.

    • Violations of the "Antarctic international law" which includes the Antarctic Treaty, the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection with its annexes, and the Recommendations, Measures, Decisions and Resolutions adopted by the ATCM, were already observed. In most cases, these are offenses under the rules of access to Antarctica2, to the environmental protection rules3 and to the rules of supervision of human activities4.
This legal body is normally enforced by the domestic laws of each State Party towards its nationals and towards the activities under its jurisdiction. However, the enforcement of this legal body may vary from one State to another, depending on the international instruments it has ratified (Antarctic Treaty, Madrid Protocol), on whether it endorsed or not the regulatory measures of the ATCM, and on the way in which it enforced the latter in its domestic law.

    • Violations of domestic laws5 refer to acts defined as illegal in the domestic laws of the States Parties, that would be committed in the region, especially in criminal cases (murder, assault, illegal trafficking, theft, damages...) in labour laws cases, etc. These domestic laws actually cover any situation likely to happen in the Antarctic Treaty area other than those covered by Antarctic international law.

    2) The jurisdiction to hear cases

Several kinds of jurisdiction may be invoked by States Parties in the Antarctic Treaty area:
    • The flag-State’s or registration State’s jurisdiction may be claimed if the offenses occurred aboard a ship or an aircraft.
    • Territorial jurisdiction could be invoked by a State if offenses were committed on a territory it claims. However, article IV of the Antarctic Treaty prohibits Parties to take any measure that would imply an exercise of their sovereignty on a territorial basis. Thus, the exercise of jurisdiction on a territorial basis would enter in conflict with this article IV.
    • The jurisdiction of the State that operates a station could be claimed, because that State is responsible for specifying the conditions under which it grants access to the facilities and for delivering access permits6. These permits are granted on a discretionary basis, based mostly on the maximum capacity of the bases and the kind of activities visitors wish to undertake. A State may therefore assert jurisdiction for offenses that occurred in a base it operates or during operations conducted outside the base by personnel of the base. Since authorisation is not specifically granted on the basis of Antarctic international law, the State could assert its jurisdiction for infractions to both Antarctic international law and to its own domestic law.
    • The jurisdiction of the State that granted an activity authorization in the Treaty area could be invoked towards any person who would have been granted such an authorization. This jurisdiction, however, would be limited to infractions to Antarctic international law, insofar as such authorisations are based on the Madrid Protocol which imposes a preliminary environmental impact assessment to any activity conducted in the Treaty area. 
    • Personal jurisdiction of the State could be invoked for any offense committed by one of its nationals in Antarctica, under both the Antarctic international law and its own domestic law.

These kinds of jurisdiction could be invoked concurrently by several States for the same offenses that could involve people of various nationalities. This makes it necessary to establish a method for defining the State competent to hear the cases. This method could be based on:
    • The status of the people involved in the offenses. Article VIII of the Treaty stipulates that the inspectors referred to in article VII, scientific personnel and "members of the staffs accompanying any such persons shall be subject only to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party of which they are nationals" for the actions performed to carry out their functions. Therefore this rule to attribute jurisdiction does not apply to the categories of persons not mentioned in article VIII (particularly tourists);
    • The nationality of the persons involved in the offenses. According to what is provided for by their domestic laws, States could assert their jurisdiction if the victim is one of their nationals7, and in some occasions if the offender is one of their nationals - especially for offenses that do not affect persons (i.e. environmental damage).
    • This latter criterion leaves a risk of a conflict of jurisdictions of several States for the same offenses, that could be solved by possible judicial cooperation agreements between these States or, if such agreements do not exist, by political agreements.

In general, it seems essential that the Treaty Parties include in their domestic laws provisions enabling them to exert their personal jurisdiction with respect to their nationals in Antarctica and/or the members of the expeditions they authorise and/or the personnel authorized to access their bases, and provisions recognizing the proceedings initiated with respect to their nationals by other Parties.

    3) The persons responsible for the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica and their prerogatives

It seems important to appoint in Antarctica people legally entitled to collect evidence and testimonies and to adopt provisional measures against suspects.

Each Antarctic base should have at least one personnel legally authorised by the State that operates it to take police measures to have the law enforced.

For non-governmental onshore activities outside the bases States remain, in principle, competent with respect to their nationals and/or members of an expedition they authorised. But the absence of on-site personnel legally authorised by the State to take law enforcement actions to have the law enforced represents a risk that infractions would not be prevented and/or reported and that no official document could be drawn up before the return of these persons to their States. The question therefore arises whether it would be possible to put these persons under the jurisdiction of the captain of the ship or aircraft that transported them for a brief onshore stay, and to give sufficient powers to an expedition leader during extended stays.

The appointment of a person with law enforcement authority in the bases and within expeditions would imply the recognition of their acts and procedures by all the State Parties whose nationals would be present in the base or part of the expedition. This depends in particular on their domestic laws, on the quality of their judicial cooperation and on the status of the person authorised on-site to exercise the law enforcement prerogatives (magistrate, civil servant, private individual...).

The time necessary to transfer the alleged offenders to the competent State to prosecute them  risks resulting in an alteration of evidence and variations in testimonies, and raises the question of the conditions under which the alleged perpetrators of an offense could be subjected to measures restricting their freedom during the period of time necessary to bring them before the competent judicial authority.

The possibility to take measures restricting freedom with respect to the alleged perpetrator of an offense for the purposes of investigation and/or safety of the persons present in the base or participating in the expedition appears also to be in need of thorough study.

In general, it seems essential that the Parties include in their domestic laws provisions enabling their courts to recognize evidence and testimonies provided by other State Parties to the Treaty.

Proposals

The foregoing developments show the complexity of the issue and the need to find a structured answer. The fast increase in traffic to the Antarctic Treaty area and the increase in offences that can derive from it prompted France to consider it necessary to have a debate at the ATCM on the "questions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica" mentioned in Article IX.1.e of the Antarctic Treaty.

France therefore wishes to submit the foregoing considerations at the ATCM and proposes, if the Consultative Parties deem it necessary, to lead an IWG by correspondence (electronic exchanges) on the basis of a mandate that would be specified by the ATCM by adopting the attached Resolution to this WP.
Draft Resolution XX (2012)

The Representatives,

Recalling the Antarctic Treaty adopted on 1st December 1959 and its Protocol on Environmental Protection adopted on 4th October 1991;

Convinced of the necessity to ensure compliance with the principles of legality and rule of law in Antarctica;

Determined to enforce, in Antarctica, the provisions of the Antarctica Treaty, the Protocol on Environmental Protection, and the Recommendations, Measures, Decisions and Resolutions adopted by the ATCM ;

Determined to ensure that the legal system applicable to Antarctica guarantees that any offense committed in the region shall not escape the jurisdiction of a judge and shall not go unpunished ;

Recognising that the specificity of Antarctic Treaty System and the physical constraints of this continent call for specific modalities to exercise jurisdiction;


Recommend that:
    1. An Intercessional Contact Group (ICG) be established with the assistance of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty ;
    2. This ICG be in charge of :
        a) Leading a discussion on the exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty area and in particular on :
            ▪ The identification of applicable laws in the Antarctic Treaty area ;
            ▪ The identification of offenses likely to be committed there ;
            ▪ The definition of the basis or bases for the competence of the State Parties for the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica ;
            ▪ The definition of the competent State to hear the cases of infraction and the criteria for establishing this competence - especially when the infraction involves nationals of several States Parties ;
            ▪ The manner in which the domestic laws of State Parties take into account the specificity of Antarctica for questions related to the exercise of jurisdiction ;
            ▪ The practical solutions to resolve conflicts of laws, competences and jurisdictions in the Antarctica Treaty area.
        b) Preparing a report on the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica and make recommendations for the attention of the XXXVIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
