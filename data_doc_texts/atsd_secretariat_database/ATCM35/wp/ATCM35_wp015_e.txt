Site Guidelines for D’Hainaut Island, Mikkelsen Harbour, Trinity Island

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina and United States, in conjunction with IAATO

Summary
Site guidelines have been prepared for D'Hainaut Island Mikkelsen Harbour, Trinity Island.  The proponents recommend that the CEP submit the site guidelines for adoption by the ATCM.

Background
    1. At CEP XIV IAATO submitted Information Paper 105 ‘Report on IAATO operator use of Antarctic Peninsula landing sites and ATCM visitor site guidelines, 2009-10 & 2010-11 season’.  IAATO reported that most of the landings were covered by site guidelines or under National Programme management through their proximity to stations. IAATO suggested that two additional sites should adopt site guidelines for visitors in the near future, one of which is D’Hainaut Island, Mikkelsen Harbour, Trinity Island.
    2. Mikkelsen Harbour (Latitude 63° 54’S, Longitude 60° 47’W) is a small bay, lined with ice cliffs, indenting the south side of Trinity Island between Skottsberg and Borge Point. D’Hainaut Island, in the harbour is the location of most visits.
    3. The island is recognised for its historical importance and contains the remains of a whalers’ water boat and large pile of whale bones. The site also has important environmental values: a number of bird species breed in the area, and several seal and penguin species use the beach as a resting place. A small Argentine refuge is located on the island.  
    4. The United Kingdom, Argentina, United States and IAATO have produced Site Guidelines for D’Hainaut Island, Mikkelsen Harbour (Annex 1).

Recommendation
The United Kingdom, Argentina, United States and IAATO recommend that the CEP submit the site guidelines for adoption by the ATCM.
