Revised Visited Site Guidelines: 
Aitcho Islands
Working Paper submitted by Ecuador and Spain
Background
Resolution 5 (2005) Resolution on Site Guidelines for Visitors (Stockholm) included in the ATCM XXVIII Final Report recommended “the application of Site guideline approved by the ATCM.” These guidelines were adopted based on the report submitted on WP 031 by the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States to ATCM XXVIII. One of the included sites was Aitcho Islands, ranking among the top fifteen visited sites in the Antarctic Peninsula. This resolution also recommended that “administrative procedures be introduced to ensure that the Site Guidelines can be readily modified in order to reflect the fast-changing environmental conditions.”  
This revision procedure was established through Resolution 1 (2010), which was subsequently derogated by Resolution 4 (2011), currently in force. This second Resolution recommends that “any proposed amendment to existing Site Guidelines be discussed by the Committee for Environmental Protection, which should advise the ATCM accordingly.”
ATCM XXIX WP 002 Policy Issues Arising from On-Site Review of Guidelines for Visitor Sites in the Antarctic Peninsula (Edinburgh) recommends, among other things, that “, in the event of any significant change in the current level and type of visits to any of the sites, Site Guidelines should be reviewed.” This document also proposes that “the CEP considers options for systematic and regular monitoring of the sites.”
The need to periodically review these documents is likewise derived from ATCM XXXIV WP 045 Report of the open-ended Intersessional Contact Group on revision of environmental elements of Recommendation XVIII-1 (Buenos Aires). This document also proposes that “the CEP […] decides that in general, site guidelines should be periodically reviewed at least every five years.”
Also at ATCM XXXIV, Ecuador submitted IP 0126, Manejo turístico para la isla Barrientos (Buenos Aires) where it states that “during recent years, the Consultative States involved in Antarctic activities have undertaken tourism monitoring and analysis efforts on the various visited sites in Antarctica” and that “Since 2007, Ecuador has made several observations concerning tourism dynamics on Barrientos Island (Aitcho Islands)". In addition, Ecuador expressed its interest in “undertaking tourism monitoring activities on Barrientos Island during the Antarctic summer season”.
Since the 2008-9 campaign, a Spanish research team has become involved in the evaluation of disturbance caused by visitor presence on Aitcho Islands, establishing close cooperation with Ecuador on the 2011-12 campaign. 

2011-12 Campaign follow-up activities 
During the last summer season, monitoring activities begun in previous years were continued, taking place between 12th January and 19th February 2012. They included:
    •  Visitor dynamics monitoring: visited sites and activities, visitor group size and organisation.
    •  Biophysical indicator monitoring on used tracks: Track width and size, alternative tracks and loss of vegetation cover.
The most relevant observations made by the field campaign include the following: 
    • During the relevant time period, a total of thirteen vessels moored opposite the south beach, and four on the north-eastern side of the island. It should be noted that this primary landing area is not considered as such in the current Visited Sites Guidelines, and that the area identified in this document as secondary landing area has not been used during the 2011-2012 season.
    • Visited sites selected by tour operators were: The rookery located at the eastern end of the island, the track designated to cross closed Area B (described in the visiting guidelines), the unofficial track running across the centre of the island, and the free movement area at the western end of Aitcho Island. 
    • About 41% of tourism expeditions used the unofficial track running across Closed Area B (see Figure 2), while 24% used the track designated in the visiting guidelines.34% stayed in the rookery beach area.
    • Visitor group size varied in each case, as well as the presence of and supervision by the guides. Visit groups were organised to move from one end of the island to the other. However, groups were not always organised for these journeys and, in most cases, they did not comply with the supervision requirement of one guide per group of 10 visitors, as specified in the current Site Guidelines. 
    • 65% of tourism expeditions monitored visited the western area of Aitcho Island. The largest concentrations of visitors occurred in the area near the melt water lagoon, where a group of 99 people was documented to be present in the wallow area for elephant seals (Mirounga leonina).

Impacts assessed on tracks
On 16th January 2012, a first biophysical measurement was performed on the track designated to cross Closed Area B and the unofficial track going across the centre of the island. The study was repeated on 16th February 2012, at the end of the season. The following results were obtained:
    • As for the track designated to cross Closed Area B (Figure 1), by the start of the season, no vegetation cover areas affected by visitor trampling or the presence of alternative paths or tracks were observed. Moss areas around the stream and those close to the rocky area of the coastal trail were in good condition. 
    • When the study was repeated at the end of the touristic season, considerable damage and vegetation cover detachment were observed in many parts of the trail, especially in moss meadows areas close to the coast and to the stream (Figure 2). Alternative sections to the official track were observed, totalling 59 meters in length, extending mainly over moss. At several points, these tracks were over 6 metres wide, and were covered in footprints. Despite its lesser use, damage to the substratum and vegetation cover on these tracks was severe due to the higher water levels in soils, which make them more vulnerable to trampling. 
    • As for the unofficial track going across the centre of the island, the same indicators were used at the beginning of the touristic season, in order to collect reference information. The analysis performed by the end of the fieldwork did not reveal significant damage to the substratum or loss of vegetation coverage, even though this track was used by a larger amount of visitors. The lesser amount of water and the substratum type make this sector less vulnerable to trampling than the track designated in the visiting guidelines. 
    • Even when a small increase in track width was observed at certain very specific points, these changes were not as evident as those observed in the official track.  There was no evidence of alternative tracks formation.

Proposed changes 
In view of the above, the Parties propose the following changes to the current Visited Sites Guidelines for Aitcho Island: 
    • Revision of texts included in Annex 1.
    • Replacement of the current primary anchoring area (north beach at the eastern end of the island) for the south beach at the eastern end of the island.
    • Replacement of the current secondary anchoring area (north beach at the western end of the island) for the north beach at the eastern end of the island.
    • Replacement of the designated route crossing Closed Area B, in order to favour the recovery of the vegetation cover close to the track, and as a precautionary measure. A proposal is put forward for the recovery of the old route crossing the centre of the island and connecting the south beach at the eastern end of Aitcho Island to the free movement area located at the western end.
    • Inclusion of the above changes on the maps of Visited Sites Guidelines for Aitcho Island.
Lastly, the proponents of this document hereby inform the Treaty of their availability to continue with monitoring activities during subsequent Antarctic summers, in order to evaluate the results of the proposed management measures and, if the Parties so decide, extend the monitoring actions to other visited sites. To such end, proponents call upon Member Countries to take part in this effort.

The photo shows how visitors fail to walk along the stream, and the surrounding moss community is usually significantly affected by their trampling.

This photo also evidences the way in which the trampling area affects a vast areas the moss carpet. 









This image shows how visitors tend to avoid moister areas, causing the track to widen significantly.
