Invitation to the WMO









Invitation to the WMO
Submitted by Norway and United Kingdom


Climate change and the implications for governance and management in Antarctica is both a relevant and important topic for the Antarctic Treaty system, as inter alia discussed in detail at the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on climate change and the implications for governance and management in Antarctica (ATME 2010). The ATCM has on this basis agreed to maintain climate change as a permanent agenda item to its meetings, thereby signalizing the importance of keeping an eye on the development of knowledge related to climate change and implications.  
Information provided by SCAR and other expert bodies have underscored the need for further research and modelling efforts with the aim to improve our  understanding of the Antarctic climate changes, to better inform our considerations and decisions related to management in a changing environmental setting. 
One step that has been taken in order to coordinate efforts to improve development and understanding of climate change in the polar regions is WMO’s establishment of an Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar Observations, Research and Services in 2008 (with first meeting in 2009).  The aim of the panel is to bring observations, research and services together, allowing WMO to maximize the value of its and its partners’ investments in Polar Regions. The specific charge of the Panel is attached as Appendix 1 to this paper. 
At the ATME 2010 the following recommendation was made (Recommendation 9) relevant on the basis of the above: Noting that the WMO Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar Observations, Research and Services, promotes and coordinates relevant programs carried out in the polar regions, the ATME recommends that the Panel and others be urged to increase the refinement of Antarctic climate models, and the WMO be invited to provide regular reports to the ATCM to update Parties on progress with outcomes of the Committee’s activities. 
At ATCM XXXIII, discussing the recommendations from ATME 2010, time did not allow for in-depth consideration of all recommendations, and it was agreed to return to these recommendations at a later meeting. No further action has been taken with respect to Recommendation 9 (cited above) after this. 
WMO has been invited as an expert observer to all ATCMs since ATCM XIV (1987), but has not been present at or provided reports to the ATCM since ATCM XXV (2002). Attempts should be considered to remedy this situation in view of the expertise that WMO could bring to the table with regard to updated knowledge on climate change and climate change work in the Antarctic context.

Proposal
Norway and UK emphasizes the importance of the ATCM being kept up-to-date on developments in coordinated meteorological and climate programs and efforts in Antarctica as basis for Parties understanding and knowledge basis in questions relating to management of Antarctica in a changing climate context.  
Norway and UK therefore propose that ATCM XXXV invites WMO specifically to the next ATCM(s) to update Parties on progress with outcomes of its Council Panel of Experts on Polar Observations, Research and Services activities relevant for the development of Parties’ understanding of climate change (and implications) in Antarctica, as basis for Parties’ further efforts to ensure an appropriate knowledge-based management framework.


Appendix 1 (http://www.wmo.int/pages/governance/ec/tor_en.html#antarctic) 

Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar Observations, Research and Services 
Terms of reference (Resolution 5 (EC-LXIII))
The Panel will be composed of members nominated by the Permanent Representatives of Members, including Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, that have active meteorological, hydrological, oceanographic or cryospheric programmes, in particular in the Polar Regions;
 Observers from other groups may be invited to attend meetings of the Panel;
 The Panel will make recommendations to the Executive Council within its terms of reference, including the recommended Antarctic Observing Network (AntON) and standard practices applied for them, especially recommendations for updates of the Manual on the GOS (WMO-No. 544), Volume II, Chapter 7 “The Antarctic” and the Manual on the GTS (WMO No. 386), Volume II, Chapter 7 “The Antarctic”, and relevant parts of the Manual on the GDPFS (WMO-No. 485);
 The Panel will undertake the following:
For both Polar Regions:
(a) Development and promotion of an integrated approach to understand the global impact of changes in Polar Regions so that required services may be provided to users and that governments may be advised on aspects of adaptation and mitigation;
(b) Ensure that operational and research observing networks in Polar Regions (including the Antarctic Observing network (AntON)) are integrated within the framework of WIGOS and WIS and be enhanced to include cryosphere related variables;
(c) Make a concerted effort to engage WMO Members, technical commissions and regional associations, as well as relevant research and international organizations and bodies, to improve predictive capability in Polar Regions on timescales from hours to centuries; 
(d) To provide a high-level WMO partnership in the activities aimed to secure the IPY observing system legacy in close communication with operational agencies in Member countries and international organizations that have a great interest in Polar Regions, such as the Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON);
(e) To guide the development of the Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) in collaboration with technical commissions, regional associations and relevant international programmes, organizations and bodies;
(f) To guide the development of the Global Integrated Polar Prediction System (GIPPS) in collaboration with technical commissions, regional associations and relevant international programmes, organizations and bodies;
(g) To coordinate WMO participation in the International Polar Decade (IPD) initiative;
(h) To facilitate acquisition, exchange and archiving of observational data from Polar Regions in compliance with WIGOS requirements related to instruments, data exchange (WIS) and the Quality Management Framework (QMF) and to underpin the provision of services required for safe operations in the Polar Regions;
(i) To provide a forum for discussion of relevant scientific issues and to make recommendations on meteorological, hydrological, oceanographic and cryospheric research and operations related to the Polar Regions;
(j) To provide regular input on issues related to polar meteorology, hydrology, oceanography and the cryosphere to the activities of relevant groups or bodies, such as the Scientific Committees for WCRP, GCOS, GAW and WWRP/THORPEX; the International Arctic Science Committee; the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research; the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes; the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO; the Global Framework for Climate Services, WMO Technical Commissions, Regional Associations and Programmes, including the World Climate Programme (WCP);
(k) To ensure close collaboration with other international organizations concerned such as the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), the Arctic Council, the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR), the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS) and other relevant associations of IUGG, the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP), the Forum of Arctic Research Operators (FARO), and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC);

For the Antarctic:
The Panel should cooperate, as appropriate, with other relevant international and regional entities:
(a) To promote the execution of the resolutions of Congress and the Executive Council in the area from 60ºS to 90ºS;
(b) To coordinate programmes of surface and upper-air meteorological observations in the Antarctic, working with relevant international scientific organizations, and liaise with Regional Associations I, III and V in relation to sub-Antarctic observations;


(c) To coordinate design of the Antarctic Observing Network (AntON), comprising surface and upper-air stations, including the GCOS Surface Network (GSN), GCOS Upper-Air Network (GUAN), Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) and other relevant observing components;
(d) To coordinate standardization of observing, coding, data exchange and data management practices applied for the Antarctic;

For the Arctic: 
While appropriate functions are covered by respective regional associations, the Panel may liaise with them in defining appropriate components of Arctic observing systems and services;
