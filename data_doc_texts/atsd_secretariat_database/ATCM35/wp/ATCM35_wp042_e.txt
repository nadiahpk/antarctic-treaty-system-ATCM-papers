Review of the Management Plan for 
ASMA No 4: Deception Island
Submitted by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and United States

Abstract
The Deception Island Management Group (DIMG)1 has conducted its first five-yearly review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 4, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. DIMG recommends the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plans for these Areas. 
Introduction
Deception Island (latitude 62°57’S, longitude 60°38’W), South Shetland Islands, is a unique Antarctic island with important natural, scientific, historic, educational and aesthetic values. The need to conserve and protect these unique and outstanding values, whilst at the same time managing the variety of competing demands placed upon them, lead to the designation of Deception Island as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area under Measure 3 (2005)  (ASMA No. 4: Deception Island, South Shetland Islands). 
In accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, DIMG has conducted its first five-yearly review of the Management Plan for ASMA 4: Deception Island, South Shetland Islands.
The following sections briefly describe the proposed amendments arising from the review of the Management Plan. The revised draft management plan, with changes highlighted2, is attached for consideration.
Substantial issues:
Section 2
            ▪ An additional element has been added to the list of objectives, namely the need to safeguard in particular those areas which thus far have not been significantly modified by human activity. 

Section 3
            ▪ An additional element has been added to the list of management activities, namely the need to ensure that those responsible for activities in the South Shetland Island area should be aware of the desirability of avoiding use of Deception Island as an emergency harbour if the situation at hand deems this possible and appropriate. This element has been added due to the ecological sensitivities and safety issues of the island. 
Section 5
            ▪ Updated census figures on chinstrap penguins have been added. These show a marked and significant decline in the population of this species in the Area. 

Section 6
            ▪ DIMG submits to CEP XV/ATCM XXXV suggested Visitor Site Guidelines for Pendulum Cove.  The list of protected areas and managed zones within the Area has been revised to reflect the addition of Visitor Site Guidelines for this landing site (noting that modifications will be necessary if the Pendulum Cove Guidelines are not adopted). 
Section 8
            ▪ DIMG submits to CEP XV/ATCM XXXV suggested Visitor Site Guidelines for Pendulum Cove.  The list of supporting documents has been revised to reflect the addition of Visitor Site Guidelines for this landing site (noting that modifications will be necessary if the Pendulum Cove Guidelines are not adopted). 
Section 9
            ▪ A statement discouraging overwintering activities (unless for scientific purposes) has been added. This due to the peculiarities regarding safety (also for the rescue operations) with respect to any potential volcanic activity on the island. 
            ▪ A statement specifying required action with respect to objects likely to stem from a Historic Site and Monument found in other areas of the island has been added.  
            ▪ A statement underlining the ban on introduction of non-native species has been included, containing also reference to the new Appendix 11 (see below). 
Section 10
            ▪ A point requesting/encourage Parties to notify the DIMG about any governmental and non-governmental activities authorized by their competent authorities has been added. 
Appendix 5
            ▪ The appendix has been adjusted to reflect major developments that have taken place since the adoption of the management plan in 2005 and which impact the content of the appendix. This relates in particular to the adoption of Visitor Site Guidelines and General Visitor Guidelines.
Appendix 6
    • The appendix containing the Volcanic Alert Scheme and Escape Strategy has been substantially changed in form and content. 

Appendix 11
            ▪ Appendix 11 (Practical biosecurity measures) is a new addition to the Management Plan. It has been added due to the fact that Deception Island is exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of introduced non-native species.  The high level of human occupation and visitation means the likelihood of unintentional introduction of non-native species is high.  The mild climate, relative to other areas of Antarctica, and the presence of geothermally heated sites may make establishment of introduced marine and terrestrial species more likely than at other Antarctic locations.  Deception Island has already been subject to non-native introductions: six species of non-native invertebrates have been recorded on the island and one introduced plant has also been found and subsequently eradicated.  Guidance provided is inter alia based on guidance advice provided in the CEP Non-native species manual, where two central resources are the COMNAP/SCAR Checklists for supply chain managers of National Antarctic Programmes for the reduction in risk of transfer of non-native species and the SCAR environmental code of conduct for terrestrial scientific field research in Antarctica.
Editorial issues
            ▪ Minor editorial amendments have been made throughout.
            ▪ Adjustments to descriptions where new knowledge has become available have been made throughout.
            ▪ The reference to wilderness values in introduction to Section 1 has been removed, since wilderness has not been identified and specified as specific value to be protected in the Area.
            ▪ Heading (iv) in Section 1 (formerly Education and Tourism activities, now Educational values) has been edited to attempt consistency in use of terms between ASMA management plans. 
            ▪ An addition at the end of Section 8 clarifies that the appendices containing management plans and site visitor guidelines will be updated with the latest versions of these documents as they have been adopted by the ATCM.  
            ▪ A reference to the CEP Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of birds in Antarctica has been added to Section 9 (ii).
            ▪ Minor amendments/adjustments in Appendix 3 (Whalers Bay Conservation Strategy) 
            ▪ Minor amendments/adjustments in Appendix 4 (Facilities Zone Code of Conduct) 

Recommendation
Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and United States recommend that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for:
            ▪ ASMA 4 Deception Island, South Shetland Island (Attachment A).
