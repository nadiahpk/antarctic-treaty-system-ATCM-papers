Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

Working Paper submitted by Australia, France and Spain

Summary

This paper reports on representations conducted by Consultative Parties in accordance with Resolution 1 (2011) to encourage those States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but are not yet Party to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol), to become Party to the Protocol.  In 2012, Australia, France and Spain, together with other Consultative Parties, conducted representations  to encourage these States to become Party to the Protocol. All States approached expressed strong support for the objectives and principles of the Protocol.  A number of states approached were actively seeking or positively disposed to becoming Parties to the Madrid Protocol. A number of the States advised they were unable to commit to becoming Parties to the Protocol at this time. Australia, France and Spain propose that the ATCM should remain seized of this matter and continue to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Madrid Protocol to become Party to the Protocol.  A draft Resolution is presented at Attachment A.  

Background

ATCM XXXIV marked the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty, the 50th anniversary of the first Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Canberra and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Against this backdrop, Parties adopted the Declaration on Antarctic Cooperation on the Occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Entry into Force of the Antarctic Treaty (the Declaration) which, among other things, affirmed that the Madrid Protocol and its Annexes are “playing a significant role in protecting the Antarctic environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems” and Parties’ intention to 

“Appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, to become Party to the Protocol”.

At ATCM XXXIV, Parties discussed WP 40 Strengthening Support for the Madrid Protocol, submitted by Australia, France and Spain, which proposed that the ATCM appeal to States that are Parties to the Antarctic Treaty but not yet Parties to the Madrid Protocol to commit to accession to the Protocol. At the meeting Australia, France and Spain offered to make diplomatic representations to these States to encourage their accession. Australia, France and Spain proposed developing an aide-memoire to be provided to States with a copy of the Declaration as part of these representations. The content of this aide-memoire would be coordinated with Consultative Parties in advance of representations being made and all Consultative Parties would be invited to participate in the representations. A final version of the aide-memoire would be available sufficiently in advance of planned representations to allow for preparation by Consultative Parties participating in the representations.

Resolution 1 (2011) recommended that Governments:

“1. appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, to become Party to the Protocol;
2. accept the offer by France, Australia and Spain to coordinate with other Consultative Parties on representations to these States;
3. invite France, Australia and Spain to report on the outcome of these representations at the XXXVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.”

Preparation and conduct of the representations in the intersessional period 

Australia, France and Spain developed a draft aide-memoire which was circulated by the Secretariat to all Consultative Parties (Circular 51/2011) on 8 February 2012. The Circular invited comments on the draft text and sought an indication from Consultative Parties of whether they intended to participate in representations to be made in capitals. The aide-memoire was approved by all Consultative Parties. Once finalised, the aide-memoire was distributed by Australia, France and Spain to missions in relevant capitals to coordinate the conduct of representations (including with other participating Consultative Parties). 

Resolution 1 (2011) and the aide-memoire gave a mandate to Australia, France and Spain, together with other Consultative Parties, to carry out representations to encourage relevant Non-Consultative Parties  to become Parties to the Madrid Protocol on behalf of the ATCM as a whole.

Australia, France and Spain, together with other Consultative Parties, conducted representations between late February and early April in the capitals of States which are Party to the Antarctic Treaty but not yet Party to the Protocol, including in Kuala Lumpur (we welcome Malaysia’s accession to the Antarctic Treaty with effect from 31 October 2011) (Annex 1).1 The United Kingdom conducted representations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Outcomes of the representations

Overall, the States approached expressed strong support for the objectives and principles of the Protocol. Among the 15 Non-Consultative Parties, seven had already signed the Madrid Protocol2 but were yet to ratify it (Annex 2). Eight other States had not signed or ratified the Protocol. 
A number of States approached were actively seeking or positively disposed to becoming Parties to the Madrid Protocol.  Two States had already commenced the process of accession.  Some States undertook to become Parties to the Protocol as soon as possible.  Other States expressed an interest in the Antarctic environment and committed to consider becoming Parties to the Madrid Protocol in the longer term.
A number of States advised that they were unable to become Parties to the Madrid Protocol at this time.  However, aware of the environmental matters at stake, these States underlined the complexity of implementing the Madrid Protocol due to the number of topics it deals with and challenges in transcribing the Protocol and its annexes into domestic legislation. Possible budgetary implications were also a concern for some States.

Proposal

Australia, France and Spain were encouraged by the strong support expressed by States for the objectives and principles of the Protocol and the intention of some States to become Parties to the Madrid Protocol. Given that not all non-Consultative Parties were able to commit to become Parties to the Madrid Protocol at this time, Australia, France and Spain propose the ATCM should remain seized of the matter and continue to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Madrid Protocol to become Party to the Protocol. 
In addition, Australia, France and Spain propose to coordinate follow-up representations in the forthcoming intersessional period, open to all Consultative Parties, to renew the message to the 15 Non-Consultative Parties and provide them with information on the content and the enforcement of the Protocol and its annexes. Australia, France and Spain propose to report on behalf of all Consultative Parties to   ATCM XXXVI in Brussels. 
These proposals are consistent with the commitment made by all Parties in the 2011 Declaration. 


Recommendations

Australia, France and Spain recommend that the Parties:
    • adopt the Resolution attached at Attachment A.


Attachment A

Draft Resolution XX (2012)

Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

The Representatives, 

Recalling Resolution 1 (2011), which recorded the Parties’ agreement that the achievement of the objectives and principles of the Protocol will be better ensured if the Protocol is supported by a larger number of States;

Recalling further that Resolution 1 (2011) called on all Parties to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Protocol to become Party to the Protocol, to accept the offer by Australia, France and Spain to coordinate with other Consultative Parties on representations to these States and invited Australia, France and Spain to report on the outcome of these representations at ATCM XXXV;

Welcoming the commitment by several Parties that are not yet Party to the Protocol to accede to the Protocol;

Recommend that:

    1) The ATCM remain seized of the need to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, to become Party to the Protocol;
    2) Further representations are required in follow-up to activities conducted in the 2011-12 ATCM intersessional period to make progress towards increasing the number of Parties to the Madrid Protocol; 
    3) Australia, France and Spain, with other Consultative Parties as appropriate, report to ATCM XXXVI on the outcomes of follow-up representations in the 2012-13 ATCM intersessional period; 
    4) Consultative Parties be invited to update future ATCMs, as appropriate, on this matter; and
    5) The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat post the text of the Resolution 1 (2011) on its website in a way that makes clear that it is no longer current.
