The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting

Working Paper submitted by Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States 

Summary

At previous Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, Parties have highlighted the need for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) to adopt a strategic approach to the conduct of its work.  The development and implementation of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Plan) would assist with meeting this objective.  Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States propose that the ATCM decide to develop a Plan, adopt principles and a format to guide the preparation of a Plan and agree to a process for completing a Plan.  A draft Decision is presented at Attachment A.  

Background

The concept of a Plan was first considered at ATCM XXXII in Baltimore (2009) under the special agenda item ‘50th anniversary: looking to the future of Antarctica’.  The meeting agreed that:

‘development and use of a strategic multiple-year work plan, as done by the CEP, would help the Treaty Parties anticipate and structure both ATCMs and intersessional work to better address issues of priority and timely importance. Such a “strategic” plan would be used as a tool to help the Treaty Parties anticipate matters requiring priority attention, and to decide when, where, and how those matters could best be addressed. It would be used only to assist the ATCMs in formulating targeted agendas for subsequent meetings and determining preparatory work needed to deal effectively with the targeted issues. It would be reviewed at each ATCM and be updated as necessary.’

This agreement resulted in the addition of an item ‘Development of a Multi-year Strategic Work Plan’ to the agenda for ATCM XXXIII (2010).  ATCM XXXIII focused on a proposal for shortening the length of the ATCM.  The agenda item was considered again at ATCM XXXIV (2011), during which Parties expressed broad support for developing a Plan, and provided examples of issues they regarded as priorities.  Separately, Australia is presenting IP 11 Summary of Issues: Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, as an accompaniment to this paper, which summarises previous discussions on this subject.

Proposal

Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States propose that the Parties decide to develop a five-year rolling Plan and agree to a process for completing the Plan.

Principles to Guide Completion of the Plan and Proposed Format of the Plan

We propose that Parties decide to develop a Plan (using the format set out at Appendix A to the attached draft Decision which draws closely on the CEP’s Work Plan) and agree to principles to guide completion of the Plan (Appendix B to the attached draft Decision contains proposed principles).  The Plan, as agreed at each ATCM, would be attached to the Final Report of the ATCM and be made available on the website of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.

Australia is also presenting IP 12 Examples to illustrate the proposed application of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan for the consideration of Parties, which provides two examples to illustrate how issues might be reflected in a Plan.  

Intersessional Work to Populate the Plan

We look forward to further discussion at ATCM XXXV of the issues that should be presented in the Plan and anticipate that these discussions will help to more clearly identify issues for inclusion in the Plan. To build on that discussion and complete the Plan, we suggest an intersessional process to determine the relative priorities of these issues, actions required, and the timing of those actions.  We propose that an open-ended Intersessional Contact Group be established to coordinate this process and to make arrangements for a two day Intersessional Workshop, which Belgium has offered to host, to be held in early 2013.  The purpose of the Workshop would be to draft a Plan for consideration at ATCM XXXVI.  Suggested terms of reference for the Workshop are presented in the accompanying draft Decision.  Australia and Belgium, as Chairs of ATCM XXXV and XXXVI, respectively, would be pleased to co-convene the open-ended Intersessional Contact Group.

Recommendations

Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States recommend that the Parties:
    • adopt the Decision attached at Attachment A.


Attachment A

Draft Decision XX (2012)

The Development of a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan
for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting

The Representatives, 


Reaffirming the values, objectives and principles contained in the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection;

Recognising the benefits of the ATCM adopting a strategic approach to the conduct of its work;

Considering that a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Plan) will contribute positively to the ATCM focusing on matters of priority and scheduling its work accordingly; 

Noting that a Plan will assist Antarctic Treaty Parties to formulate targeted agendas for subsequent ATCMs and to undertake preparatory work needed to effectively discuss and consider targeted issues.

Decide:

    1) To develop a Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Plan), using the format set out at Appendix A of this Decision.
    1) To adopt the principles set out at Appendix B of this Decision to guide the completion of the Plan.
    2) To establish an open-ended Intersessional Contact Group, co-convened by Australia and Belgium, as the Chairs of ATCM XXXV and XXXVI respectively, to coordinate the further development of the Plan and to make arrangements for an Intersessional Workshop.
    3) To hold a two day Intersessional Workshop prior to ATCM XXXVI, with the following terms of reference: 
        a. develop a draft Plan for consideration at ATCM XXXVI;
        b. report to ATCM XXXVI on the outcomes of the Workshop.

Appendix B – Principles

Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan - Principles


    1. The Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (Plan) will reflect the objectives and principles of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection.
    2. Consistent with the operation of the ATCM, adoption of the Plan, inclusion of items on the Plan, and decisions regarding the Plan will be made by consensus.
    3. The purpose of the Plan will be to ensure that the ATCM focuses on matters of priority and schedules its work accordingly.
    4. The Plan will cover a rolling period of five years and should be reviewed and updated as necessary at each ATCM to reflect work still to be completed, new issues, and changing priorities.
    5. The Plan will be dynamic and incorporate emerging issues as they arise.
    6. The Plan will identify issues that require the collective attention of the Parties, and that require discussion and/or decisions by the ATCM.
    7. For each issue, actions and/or specific tasks and timings will be identified, where appropriate.
    8. A priority for each issue will be allocated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing the highest priority.
    9. The Plan is intended to assist in shaping the agenda and working arrangements for the meeting (for example, number and type of working groups, schedule, etc.).
    10. The Plan is not intended to discourage Parties from introducing proposals on other issues for consideration by the ATCM.
