Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 110 Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands
A working paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has undertaken a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No.110 Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands.  In submitting this revised Plan, the United Kingdom recommends that the CEP ask the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans to undertake an intersessional review and to report back to CEP XVI.
Background
The primary reason for the designation of Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands (Latitude 60o39’10’’ S, Longitude 045o36’25’’ W; 0.1 km2), as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 110 is to protect environmental values, and primarily the terrestrial flora within the Area.  

The Area was originally designated as a Specially Protected Area through Recommendation IV-14 (1966, SPA No. 14) after a proposal by the United Kingdom. It was designated on the grounds that the island "supports one of the most extensive and dense areas of grass (Deschampsia antarctica) known in the Treaty Area and that it provides an outstanding example of a rare natural ecological system". These values were amplified and extended by Recommendation XVI-6 (1991) when a management plan for the site was adopted.

Following a visit to the ASPA in February 2011, the values specified in the earlier designation were reviewed.  These values are set out as follows:
    • The Area contains luxuriant swards of Antarctic hair grass Deschampsia antarctica and the  only other Antarctic flowering plant, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), is also abundant. It is also one of few sites where the grass Deschampsia is known to grow directly on Polytrichum-Chorisodontium moss banks.
    • The cryptogamic vegetation is typical of the region; however, several species of moss found on the island (Polytrichastrum alpinum (=Polytrichum alpinum) and Muelleriella crassifolia) are unusually fertile for their southerly location.  It is also possibly the only known location in Antarctica where Polytrichastrum alpinum develops sporophytes in profusion annually.  Furthermore, Polytrichum strictum (=Polytrichum alpestre) occasionally produces male inflorescences in local abundance, which is a rare occurrence in this species in Antarctica and the rare moss Plagiothecium ovalifolium occurs in moist shaded rock crevices near the shore.
    • The shallow loam-like soil associated with the grass swards was contains a rich invertebrate fauna.  The population density of the arthropod community associated with Deschampsia on Lynch Island appears unusually high, with some measurements suggesting it is one of the highest in the world. The site also shows unusual diversity for an Antarctic site.  A rare enchytraeid worm was also found in moist moss in rock crevices on the northern side of the island.  One arthropod species (Globoppia loxolineata) is near the northernmost limit of its known distribution, and specimens collected from Lynch Island exhibited unusual morphological characteristics compared to specimens collected elsewhere in the South Orkney – Antarctic Peninsula region.
    • Chromobacterium bacteria, yeasts and fungi are found in higher densities than on Signy Island, thought to be a result of the lower acidity of the soils associated with Deschampsia and the more favourable microclimate at Lynch Island.
    • The shallow gravelly loam-like soil beneath the dense swards of Deschampsia may represent one of the most advanced soil types in the Antarctic.

The revised plan is attached for the consideration of the CEP (Annex 1).  The proposed revision includes the following changes to the provisions of the existing Management Plan:
    • The text has been redrafted into the format recommended in the ‘Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ [Resolution 2 (2011)]
    • Introduction.  An introduction has been added that describes the primary reasons for the Area’s designation as an ASPA and the contribution of the Area to the Antarctic protected areas system.  The Area’s position within the framework of the ‘Environmental Domains Analysis for the Antarctic Continent’ has been described [Resolution 3 (2008)].
    • Description of values to be protected. The Area was considered to be of ‘potential value as a reference site against which to measure changes in comparable ecosystems which are experiencing substantial changes as a result of Antarctic fur seal activities’.  Low numbers of fur seals are now reported from throughout the Area.  Consequently, this text has been deleted.
    • Aims and objective.  The objective to ‘protect the plant communities, especially those associated with the Deschampsia/Colobanthus, against direct disturbance by Antarctic fur seals’ has been deleted as practical methods of preventing fur seal access to the Area are not currently available.  
    • Management activities.  The suggestion that future construction of fences or walls may be appropriate to prevent seals accessing the Area has been deleted, as experience on neighbouring Signy Island shows this approach to be unsuccessful.
    • Section 6(ii) Access to the Area.  This section has been added and includes information on possible access routes to the Area and restrictions on helicopter overflights, in accordance with the ‘Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds’ contained in Resolution 2 (2004).
    • 6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features. Text describing the boundary of the Area has been altered to enhance clarity.
    • The map of the vegetation cover within the ASPA has been redrawn to reflect a recent expansion in Deschampsia distribution (Map 3).
Recommendation
Given that the Management Plan for ASPA No.110 Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands has been amended, the United Kingdom recommends that the CEP ask the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans to undertake a more detailed intersessional review of the revised Plan and report back to CEP XVI.
