Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Taylor Glacier and Blood Falls, Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys Victoria Land
    1. Introduction
Blood Falls (77° 43' 19.7"S, 162° 16' 17.3"E) is a saline, iron-rich discharge of subglacial origin at the terminus of the Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. The feature consists of surface brine, which forms a red-orange liquid at the snout of the Taylor Glacier and a subglacial marine salt deposit and brine reservoir, estimated to be located between 1 and 6 km up-glacier from the terminus (Keys 1980; Hubbard et al. 2004). Scientists in the Taylor Valley have identified Blood Falls as meriting special protection as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) because of its unique biological and physical characteristics and high scientific and educational values.
Increasing activity on the Taylor Glacier and recent ice-core drilling projects have highlighted the need to protect the Blood Falls environment as these activities have the potential to influence the unique microbial community and chemistry of the feature. Over several years the United States has undertaken extensive consultation with the scientific community working in the Blood Falls area, and more widely, in order to develop appropriate management approaches and protected area boundaries for the feature. Consideration of the responses of the scientific community, SCAR and members of the CEP has led to the development of the attached proposed Management Plan and maps for the area. It is intended that designation of the Area will allow for scientific access to ice deep within Taylor Glacier, provided measures are in place to ensure this does not compromise the Blood Falls reservoir and hydrological system.
The approach proposed is unique in protected area management and represents the first in Antarctica, and possibly in the world, explicitly to include and represent the subglacial environment. If adopted, it will be the first sub-surface Antarctic protected area and the first to be explicitly designed in three dimensions. These points are important because of the increasing scientific interest in subglacial environments, and their importance to mechanisms that affect glacial stability, as well as their potential to further our understanding of the limits and evolution of life. It is anticipated that other subglacial environments may be identified in the future that meet the criteria for special protection under Annex V of the Madrid Protocol. It is important that approaches to protection are suitable and designed to meet the needs of subglacial protection without unnecessarily creating constraints on surface activities. 
Based on the Environmental Domains Analysis for Antarctica (Resolution 3 (2008)) the proposed Area lies within Environment S – McMurdo – South Victoria Land geologic. At one level, the proposed Area fits within this classification. However, it is worth noting that subglacial environments have not hitherto received consideration in approaches to systematic environmental-geographical frameworks for Antarctic protected areas. All criteria used in the classification specified in Resolution 3 (2008) (based on Morgan et al. 2007) are inherently surface-based. The current proposal breaks new ground by incorporating the subglacial environment into explicit recognition and representation within the Antarctic protected area system, and highlights a significant gap in the current protected areas system.  To be truly representative, the ASPA system should in the future include examples from several sub-glacial environments.
2. Values in need of special protection
The special values that have been identified at Blood Falls are as follows:
    • The physical configuration of Blood Falls is thought to be unique. The highly saline, iron-rich discharge at the glacier terminus is fed by a subglacial reservoir of ancient marine brine, which is thought to have become enclosed approximately 3 to 5 Ma B.P. (Mikucki et al. 2004).
    • The Blood Falls discharge contains a unique microbial community, of apparent marine origin. The bacteria may be capable of metabolising iron and sulphur compounds, allowing them to survive in the subglacial environment for millions of years (Mikuki et al. 2009). On account of its high iron and salt content, the Blood Falls ecosystem provides a potential analogue for exobiological studies associated with ice features on Mars.
    • The Blood Falls subglacial reservoir is comparatively accessible for study and the episodic discharge events provide a unique opportunity to sample the properties of the subglacial reservoir and its ecosystem without direct contact. It is very important for the integrity of scientific results that the discharge area is not unnecessarily disturbed. 
    • Blood Falls discharges into Lake Bonney, Taylor Valley, exerting influence over the geochemistry and microbiology parts of the lake (Mikucki et al. 2004; Lyons et al. 2005).
    • The behavior of the Taylor Glacier is thought to be unique among the Dry Valley glaciers, as the subglacial reservoir supplying Blood Falls may lubricate the glacier base (Robinson 1984).
    • The Area possesses outstanding aesthetic values and significant educational value, as the site has been the subject of a range of scientific and media articles in recent years.
3. Boundary proposal
Proposed boundaries for the Blood Falls protected area were developed through consultation with the scientific community working in the Blood Falls area, SCAR and members of the CEP.  Responses suggested that there is minimal interaction between the surface and bed of the Taylor Glacier and that the primary potential mechanism for contamination of the Blood Falls system is the input of contaminants into the reservoir. As a result, there was support from the scientific community for a protected area boundary comprised of (i) an extensive sub-surface component (i.e. subglacial and englacial), with the aim of protecting the brine reservoir, and (ii) a modest sub-aerial component (i.e. ice and land surface), with the aim of protecting the primary surface outlet and discharge, which are as follows:
    1) The proposed sub-surface component follows a precautionary approach that recognizes uncertainties in the connectivity of the Blood Falls reservoir with the subglacial hydrological system. Several approaches were considered for defining the vertical extent of the sub-surface boundary, with the conclusion that depth below the glacier surface is the most practical.
    2) The proposed sub-aerial component of the boundary includes the supraglacial drainage catchment of the main Blood Falls outlet, the surrounding moat area and a section of Santa Fe Stream. The boundary was selected on the basis that it protects the area immediately surrounding the primary Blood Falls outflow, whilst minimizing restrictions on access to surrounding sites.
The sub-surface ASPA would not impose additional restrictions on movement or activities that take place entirely on or over the glacier surface. The science community considered such restrictions unnecessary.  This approach allows continued access to the Taylor Glacier surface where activities would remain subject to pre-existing protocols established for Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys. 
Drilling on the Taylor Glacier would not be prohibited, but would be subject to peer and environmental review including the EIA process as outlined in Annex I of the Environmental Protocol, and projects would need to demonstrate that the necessary precautions were taken to avoid contamination of the reservoir.
4. Consultation in 2011-12 
A number of key recommendations were made in the consultation process, which may be summarised as follows:
    • The level of EIA should not be prescribed in the plan, although it was considered important that scientifically robust environmental impact assessment was undertaken prior to activities undertaken within the Area;
    • The suggestion made by SCAR to consider setting aside a part of the Area as a “reference area”, for example as a Restricted Zone, was not taken up in the proposal because it was considered very difficult at present to identify which part of the area would be suitable owing to uncertainties in the subglacial hydrological interconnections;
    • It was decided not to incorporate detail from the Code of Conduct for the Exploration and Research of Subglacial Aquatic Environments initiated by SCAR (2011), or other detailed procedures, into the plan. Instead, these documents are recommended for consultation, since we expect the Code in particular may evolve with experience gained. Moreover, we wished to avoid being too prescriptive in the plan in view of the complex and specialist nature of some of the techniques that would be employed, which we considered would best be assessed on a case-by-case basis using robust EIA procedures. Requiring these procedures to pay specific attention to the values of the Area offers the strongest and most practical approach to protection in this context.
The United States wishes to acknowledge with thanks all of the many excellent contributions received during the consultation process established when preparing this plan. Numerous organisations including SCAR and the CEP, and over 60 scientists worldwide have been involved in the consultation process, and a paper on the proposal has been presented and discussed at the General Assembly of the European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna, April 2012 (Carr et al. 2012) in the special session on subglacial environments attended by recognised world experts in the field. Their comments and feedback were also considered in this proposal.
