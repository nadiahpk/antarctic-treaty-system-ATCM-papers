Repair or Remediation of Environmental Damage: 
COMNAP report on its experience
Background
The COMNAP Antarctic Environment Officers Network (AEON) (now called the Environmental Expert Group) conducted in 2006 the Waste Management in Antarctica Workshop. It was held in Kingston, Tasmania, Australia on 10-11 July 2006 in conjunction with the 2006 COMNAP Annual General Meeting. The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) kindly sponsored and hosted the 2-day workshop. The proceedings of the workshop were published by COMNAP in March 2007 and are available at: www.comnap.aq/Publications/Comnap%20Publications/COMNAP_waste_management_2006.pdf.  

The purpose of the workshop was the sharing of practical information on waste management in Antarctica, with a specific focus on: 1) waste management practices; and 2) clean up of old waste. Thus the second focus of the workshop is relevant today for the discussions relating to repair and remediation at sites of past activity in Antarctica. This Information Paper therefore reviews the learning outcomes from the workshop, reminds the ATCM/CEP of examples of National Antarctic Program’s clean-up programs that have previously been reported on and have taken place and then presents a list of IP and WPs presented by various Parties over the course of the past 20 years.

Learning outcomes
Six presentations were made on day 2 of the workshop and in addition one paper was distributed.  Also, on day 1 of the workshop the SANAP presented a report on the decommissioning of E-Base that was also relevant to the Day 2 discussions and therefore relevant to this Information Paper.  A full record of all of these presentations can be found on the COMNAP website.  By reviewing each presentation, especially as regards lessons learned and learning outcomes, it was possible to produce a list of key principles which may lead to understanding of best practice in repair or remediation of sites of past activity or which may form a starting point for discussions of best practice.

A). Key fundamental decision-making required before commencement of the project (Note: assumes there has been fundamental consideration to the Environmental Protocol, in particular to Article 1(5) of Annex III). 
    • In the case of removal of a decommissioned station , there may be components that are not worn out and may still be of use - either by the same National Antarctic Program or by another National Antarctic Program or by another Antarctic user. In such a case, it may be that arrangements can be made to transfer the useful components to the user who has an interest in them. The challenge is to coordinate dismantling with an option for subsequent use, find interested parties and to minimise logistics efforts involved in any transfer of components by co-ordinating international National Antarctic Program transport capabilities, if possible, within the scheduled activities of National Antarctic Programs. The discussion would be how to avoid disposal if reuse is possible.

    • Decide whether a private/commercial contractor was required for any planned removal process. Partnerships with private/commercial clean-up companies can prove mutually beneficial; however, such partnerships must provide an ability to facilitate the work and must be a ‘good-fit’ with decision-making between the National Antarctic Program and contractors.

    • Pre-planning and extensive site characterisation is important and may include detailed site assessments, shipping and container design requirements, time-frames and operational requirements. There should also be a consideration of what impact the removal/remediation work might have on science or provision of support to science.



B). Key points to consider during the project:
    • Good management structures are required.  This includes clear management structures and procedures and clear and regular communications with stakeholders. (As often, the various stakeholders may have different project goals, backgrounds and agendas).  Clean-up operations may take several seasons to complete –therefore good documentation and continuity planning is required.

    • On ice-free ground, minimise soil disturbance.

    • Mitigate contaminant dispersal – excavate while frozen (before melt); create a diversion channel around the site, with options for the installation of impermeable barrier/booms if needed.

    • Minimise air emissions, for example by utilising covers when possible.

    • Minimise disturbance to any drainage patterns, noting that in some cases, there may be transitory impact to drainage.

    • Minimise vehicle usage and stick to allocated access routes to/from removal/remediation site.

    • Use specialised waste containers – sealed and covered.

    • Store the waste containers in an allocated site. Number the waste containers and log or keep track of those numbers and contents of each.

    • Chemical monitoring may be necessary, especially when remediations of waste dumps/garbage dumps are involved. There may be the need for a dedicated on-site chemical validation/assessment team to provide strategic responses to operations in real-time. Such on-site information is important for feedback and operational efficiency.

    • Comprehensive, documented sampling is recommended.

    • Since no specific clean-up guidelines for the Antarctic regions (contamination levels) exist, it is recommended that chemical levels go as low as practicably achievable towards Antarctic background levels. 

    • Adopt a conservative strategy to cater for waste heterogeneity and the “unknowns”, that is, apply a precautionary approach.

    • Establish a “chain of custody” under an auditable procedure, so that any waste returned from Antarctica to final site of deposition is track-able.

    • Prioritise clean-up; give priority to areas close to water, drainage areas, wildlife habitats, and non-biodegradable wastes.

C). Key points to consider after completion of Antarctic phase of remediation/removal:
    • Monitoring is recommended to detect any adverse impacts caused by the clean-up itself and to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Monitoring indicators and parameters can include: visible characteristics - measured by disturbance plots and monitoring of debris; aerial photography – used, for example, to determine wildlife extent (penguin colonies and the like); monitoring for pollutant levels - measured by sampling ground water for TPH.


D) Problems that may be encountered: 
    • Diversion of resources from supporting science activity to clean-up activity. 

    • Impact removal/remediation activities have on National Antarctic Program budgets. 

    • As with most activities in the Antarctic, removal/remediation projects have weather-dependencies. 

    • Lack of clear communications between environmental managers and operators in the field and the change-over in personnel from year to year.

Examples of remediation activities by various National Antarctic Programs
Even at the time of the workshop in 2006, there were already many examples of removal and remediation of sites by COMNAP National Antarctic Programs.  Those reported on during the workshop are as listed below and a copy of the published presentation from each can be found at www.comnap.aq/Publications/Comnap%20Publications/COMNAP_waste_management_2006.pdf.

Attachment 1 of this Information Paper provides a partial list of Working Papers and Information Papers submitted to ATCMs/CEP meetings from 1999-2011, which report on some aspect of repair and remediation activities by National Antarctic Programs. General categories can be identified from this list, those being: 
    • Old waste disposal clean-up
    • Disused/decommissioned base/station dismantling
    • Single building removal
    • Refuge dismantling 
    • Borehole remediation
    • General litter clean-up
