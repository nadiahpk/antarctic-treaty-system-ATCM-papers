ATCM Response to CCAMLR Fishing Vessel Incidents









ATCM Response to CCAMLR Fishing Vessel Incidents
1.0 	Introduction

This Working Paper has been drafted in conjunction with New Zealand’s Information Paper 17: Search and Rescue Incidents in the 2011/12 Season: FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2, which reports on two search and rescue responses which occurred in the Ross Sea during the 2011/12 season, involving the Russian-flagged FV SPARTA and the Korean-flagged FV JEONG WOO 2.  These responses drew on resources from the national programmes of New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and the United States of America; government agencies within New Zealand; and non-governmental actors.  This Working Paper proposes ways in which the ATCM could support the efforts of Parties with search and rescue coordination responsibility in the Antarctic Treaty area.   
2.0 	FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2 Search and Rescue Incidents

As detailed in New Zealand’s Information Paper: Search and Rescue Incidents in the 2011/12 Season: FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2, New Zealand coordinated two major search and rescue (SAR) responses in the 2011/12 Antarctic summer season.  These incidents involved fishing vessels, which were licensed by CCAMLR Members (Russia and the Republic of Korea) to operate in the CCAMLR Convention Area (hereafter referred to as CCAMLR vessels).  The combined total duration of the two SAR responses was 940 hours (40 days).  The responses drew on resources provided by the national programmes of New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and the United States of America; other New Zealand government agencies; and a number of CCAMLR vessels.  New Zealand also recalls the sinking in the Ross Sea of the CCAMLR vessel FV INSUNG No.1 in December 2010, and the unfortunate loss of more than twenty lives.  This incident also required resource-intensive SAR coordination by the government of New Zealand.  
3.0 	Issues for the ATCM
3.1 	Vessel Safety

These incidents highlight strong concerns about the safety of fishing vessels which operate in Antarctic waters and their suitability for ice conditions.  If not adequately addressed, unsafe and unsuitable vessels will continue to pose significant risks to human life and to the Antarctic environment; and place undue burdens on Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres (MRCCs) and national programmes operating in the area.  

While the issue of vessel safety is the primary responsibility of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), there is presently a noticeable gap in the IMO’s ability to regulate fishing vessels.  As Parties will be aware, the negotiation and adoption of an Agreement on the Torremolinos Protocol on the Implementation of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993 Relating to the 1977 Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels (hereafter referred to as the Agreement on the Torremolinos Protocol) will be considered at a diplomatic conference in South Africa in October 2012.

Parties will also be aware that work is underway by the IMO to develop a mandatory Code for ships operating in polar regions (Polar Code).  In line with an agreed two-stage approach, the IMO has been developing the Polar Code for SOLAS vessels (passenger and cargo vessels), and this will be followed by work to develop provisions for non-SOLAS vessels (fishing vessels and pleasure craft). At the IMO’s regular meeting of the Ship Design and Equipment sub-committee in February 2012, IMO Members agreed that work on provisions for non-SOLAS vessels may commence in 2013, subject to approval of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting in May 2012.

The proposed Agreement on the Torremolinos Protocol and the IMO Polar Code promise to deliver important contributions to the Antarctic, by enhancing the safety requirements of all vessels operating in the region.  New Zealand requests all ATCM Parties to support these work streams, and to consider appropriate measures to enhance the safety standards of all vessels which they license to operate in the Antarctic. 
3.2 	CCAMLR Reporting Requirements

New Zealand notes that both the FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2 incidents involved fishing vessels operating in the area managed by CCAMLR.  New Zealand encourages Russia and the Republic of Korea, as the flag States of the vessels concerned, to expeditiously undertake their investigations of these incidents as required under paragraph 10 of CCAMLR Conservation Measure 10-02 (2011), in order that these reports will be sent to the IMO and will also be available for consideration at the annual CCAMLR Commission meeting in October 2012.
3.3 	ATCM/CEP Responsibility for Vessel Incidents

New Zealand notes that the environmental impacts from incidents involving vessels ill-suited to Antarctic conditions are a core interest of the ATCM.  Resolution 1 (2004) supported “progress achieved by CCAMLR/XXII urging its Members, which are harvesting in high Antarctic latitudes, to license only those fishing vessels with at least an ice classification standard of ICE-1C”.  New Zealand recommends that Parties consider revisiting and strengthening Resolution 1 (2004) in light of recent attempts by the IMO to cover fishing vessel safety through the Agreement on the Torremolinos Protocol and the Polar Code, and an apparent lack of progress by CCAMLR in implementing its own Resolution 20/XXII (2003).

New Zealand notes that with regard to environmental incidents within the Antarctic Treaty area, the Committee for Environmental Protection has specific responsibility to: 

    • consider procedures for situations requiring urgent action, including response action in environmental emergencies (Protocol Article 12, 1 (f); Annex IV Article 12); 
    • draw the attention of all other Parties to any activity which in its opinion affects the implementation of the objectives and principles of this Protocol (Protocol Article 13, 4); and 
    • consider reports from Parties on response to environmental emergencies (Protocol Article 17; Annex IV Article 7). 

In accordance with its responsibilities above, New Zealand proposes that the ATCM make an explicit statement of interest in incidents involving stricken CCAMLR vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area.  

In addition, further work appears to be required to establish the procedures for immediate notification of, and co-operative response to, environmental emergencies identified in Article 15, 2 (b) of the Environmental Protocol, and specifically in relation to the clean-up and recovery or salvage of stricken vessels.
3.4 	Provision of information to Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres  

The FV SPARTA and FV JEONG WOO 2 incidents highlight the importance of Parties which operate vessels in the challenging conditions of the Antarctic environment ensuring that their vessels:

    • Provide their contact details, and other relevant information relating to their operations in the Antarctic, to the MRCC responsible for SAR coordination of the area in which the vessel is operating, in advance of entering the Antarctic area.
    • Understand the Master Plan of Shore-Based Facilities for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), and in the event of an emergency situation, make best use of their GMDSS equipment.  The concept of the GMDSS is that SAR authorities ashore, as well as shipping in the immediate vicinity of the ship or persons in distress, will be rapidly alerted so that they can assist in a coordinated SAR operation with the minimum of delay.
    • Understand which Search and Rescue Region they are operating within (as depicted in Admiralty List of Radio Signals Volume 5), and in the event of an emergency situation communicate with the responsible MRCC so that assistance can be rendered as quickly as possible.  Given the extreme conditions in the Antarctic region, where survival in the water is measured in minutes, it is imperative that ATCM Parties request their operators to communicate with the responsible MRCC, not only the vessel’s national MRCC, in the event of an emergency situation.
    • Implement the provisions of the Global Search and Rescue Plan established by the IMO and Resolution 34/XXX adopted by CCAMLR in 2011, and consider the advice provided in MSC.1/Circ.1184 Enhanced Contingency Planning Guidance for Passenger Ships Operating in Areas Remote from SAR Facilities.
4.0 	Draft ATCM Resolution

Given the continued occurrence of SAR incidents, which pose significant risks to human life and the Antarctic environment, and place significant burdens on MRCCs and national programmes operating in the area, New Zealand proposes that the ATCM: reaffirm its interest in SAR incidents involving CCAMLR vessels, support IMO and CCAMLR measures aimed to prevent vessel incidents, and ensure the most effective and rapid response possible once incidents occur.  A draft resolution is attached for ATCM Parties consideration and adoption.
