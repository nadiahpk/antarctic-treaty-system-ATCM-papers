Initiation of the review of the Management Plan for Antarctic
Specially Protected Area No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island,

Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Chile and
Spain
Summary
The United Kingdom, Chile and Spain have initiated a review of the
Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA)
No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands.
It is anticipated that the revised Management Plan will be
submitted to CEP XXIV in 2022.
Background
ASPA No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland
Islands, (latitude 62°34'35" S, longitude 61°13'07" W) was originally
designated as Specially Protected Area (SPA) No. 10 through
Recommendation IV-10 in 1966. Designation as an SPA was
terminated through Recommendation VIII-2 and re-designation as a
Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) was made through
Recommendation VIII-4 (1975, SSSI No. 6). Following a proposal by
Chile and the United Kingdom, the SSSI was subsequently extended
through Recommendation XVI-5 (1991) to include boundaries
similar to those of the original SPA through Recommendation XV-6
(1989, SSSI No. 31). The current version of the Management Plan
was agreed through Measure 4 (2016). Spain became a co-
managing Party, along with the United Kingdom and Chile, in 2016
(CEP XIX Final Report para. 120). The primary reason for the
designation of Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland
Islands, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) is to
protect the terrestrial and lacustrine habitats within the Area.
New developments
The United Kingdom, Chile and Spain have initiated a review of the
Management Plan for ASPA No. 126 Byers Peninsula, Livingston
Island, South Shetland Islands, in accordance with Annex V of the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and
the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for
Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2
(2011). It is anticipated that the revised Management Plan will be
submitted to CEP XXIV in 2022.
