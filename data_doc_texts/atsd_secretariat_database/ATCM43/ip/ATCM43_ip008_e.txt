Report of Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly
2-3 December 2019: London
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
Report following an Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly, marking
the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Antarctic Treaty, which
noted the ‘potentially catastrophic effects’ of climate change in
Antarctica.
Detail
Parliamentarians from 13 Antarctic Treaty Parties gathered in
London to consider what national legislatures could do to support
the Antarctic Treaty System and to promote peace, science and
environmental protection, particularly at a time of increasing effects
from climate change on Antarctica.
A consensus statement was signed by all 19 parliamentary delegates
at the Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly. Additionally, several
Parties were represented by representatives of their embassies in
London as observers to the Assembly.
In particular, the parliamentarians “note with concern the recent
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on the
Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which highlights the
profound effects of climate change on Antarctica’s ecosystems and
the potentially catastrophic effects of Antarctic ice loss on global
sea level”.
The delegates agreed to work towards establishing the Antarctic
Parliamentarians Assembly on a biennial basis, alternating between
the Southern and Northern hemispheres.
A copy of the Assembly statement is attached as an Appendix to this
paper.
Background
