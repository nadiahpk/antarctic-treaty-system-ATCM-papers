Antarctic Bioprospecting: SCAR Survey of Member Countries
Information Paper submitted by SCAR
Summary
This Information Paper provides further detail in support of WP 16
Antarctic Bioprospecting: SCAR Survey of Member Countries.
The paper includes a summary of the responses from the SCAR
survey. The findings of a literature search undertaken during early
2020 are included in the Annex.
SCAR member survey responses
The following provides further detail on the responses received
against each of the questions in the survey (which are marked in
blue).
During the last 10 years (or as appropriate for the data available to
you) of activities of your National Antarctic Programme (logistics,
or direct funding support, or both), has any research been carried
out, or is any research being carried out that is considered to be
bioprospecting or natural products research? 
NB: The activity may be a small component of a larger project. In
which case, the answer would still be yes.
15 of 22 (68%) respondent countries responded ‘yes’, to confirm
that their national Antarctic programme had carried out or
supported research that could be considered ‘bioprospecting’
against the definition provided.
Of these 15 countries 12 are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty and three are Non-Consultative Parties.
Seven of 22 (32%) respondent countries responded ‘no’.
If the answer to Question 1 is Yes, please provide the project title or
titles. If these are not available to you, please provide a contact
name and e-mail address for a source (or sources) who would be
able to supply the project titles?
The 15 countries that confirmed that their national Antarctic
programme had carried out or is carrying out research that could be
considered ‘bioprospecting’, provided lists of several projects or
programmes that they felt met the definition provided.
These were either very specific and targeted projects (e.g. single
genus or species research projects) or broad multi-species / multi-
ecosystems surveys and programmes.
A total of 78 projects or programmes were listed in the responses
provided. These could be divided into the following broad
categories as being the primary focus of the research:
Marine organisms 10
Terrestrial organisms 28
Freshwater organisms 5
Sea ice organisms 3
Land ice organisms 2
Mixed ecosystems studies 12
Unidentifiable from the information provided 18
78
Although not always identified in the responses, the majority of
these appeared to be government funded projects or programmes.
One respondent country specifically identified one project as being
privately funded.
During the last 10 years (or as appropriate for the data available to
you) of activities of your National Antarctic Programme (logistics,
or direct funding support, or both), has any research been carried
out, or is any research being carried out that could contribute to, or
later be used for bioprospecting or natural products research?  e.g.
gene sequencing, collections of genetic material, biochemical
analyses or extractions, isolation of microorganisms or taxonomic
research.
16 of 22 (73%) respondent countries responded ‘yes’, to confirm
that their national Antarctic programme had carried out or
supported research that could later be used for bioprospecting or
natural products research.
Of these 16 countries 10 are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty and six are Non-Consultative Parties.
Three respondents qualified their positive response by noting that
whilst some of their government funded projects could result in
commercialisation at a later stage, this was not the goal or
motivation for the research at the time funding was awarded.
Six of 22 (27%) respondent countries responded ‘no’.
If the answer to Question 3 is Yes, please provide the project title or
titles. If these are not available to you, please provide a contact
name and e-mail address for a source (or sources) who would be
able to supply the project titles.
In addition to the projects and programmes recorded in response to
Question 2, respondents referred to ‘numerous’ biological research
projects carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area that had the
potential to contribute to bioprospecting or natural products
research.
These projects covered marine, sea ice, terrestrial, freshwater and
glaciological (including ice shelf) environments. The projects listed
covered an array of scientific investigations including biological
material collections, genetic and genomic analyses, biochemical
analyses, physiological studies and ecological studies.
Studies covered an array of organisms including viruses, bacteria,
yeasts, micro- and macro-algae, protists and terrestrial
invertebrates. Molecular ecology and genetic studies on higher
organisms (sea birds, fish, pinnipeds and cetaceans) were also
recorded.
Many biological studies were focussed on adaptations of Antarctic
organisms and their potential responses to changing environmental
conditions.
During the last 10 years (or as appropriate given the data available
to you), has your National Antarctic Programme had, or does it
have any associations with other research or commercial entities
that are directly associated with bioprospecting or natural products
research or commercialisation?
Four of 22 respondent countries responded ‘yes’ to confirm that
their national Antarctic programme had cooperated or was actively
cooperating with research or commercial entities that are directly
associated with bioprospecting or natural products research or
commercialisation.
Of these four countries all are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty.
18 of 22 respondent countries responded ‘no’.
During the last 10 years (or as appropriate given the data available
to you), has your National Antarctic Programme or researchers or
other organisations associated with your National Antarctic
Programme applied for any patents that could be classified, under
any definition, as the outcome of bioprospecting or natural products
research activities?
Four of 22 respondent countries responded ‘yes’ to confirm that at
least one patent application had been applied for as a result of
research undertaken or supported by their national Antarctic
programme.
Of these four countries all are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty.
18 of 22 respondent countries responded ‘no’.
If the answer to Question 6 is Yes, please provide: the title of the
patent(s); the date of application; the country or countries in which
the patent was applied for, and whether or not the patent has been
granted. If this information is not available to you, please provide a
contact name and e-mail address for a source (or sources) who
would be able to supply the information.

Annex
Literature search
The peer reviewed academic literature is replete with papers of
relevance to research on psychrophilic (cold-adapted)
extremophiles as well as on their actual or potential commercial
use.
Searches on Google Scholar Undertaken in December 2019 for the
period since 2010 (the period covered by this survey) produced the
following results, though it is emphasised that not all of the
searchable items relate to the commercial application of
biologically-derived products:

Extremophiles are organisms that have evolved and developed a
wide variety of strategies to live and reproduce under harsh
conditions, such as exceptionally high or low values of temperature,
pressure, oxygen, carbon dioxide, acidity, nutrient content, water
content, salt content, etc. Extremophiles are found in a variety of
natural ‘extreme’ environments (at least to humans) such as hyper-
arid deserts, oceanic deeps, salt lakes, volcanoes and the polar
regions (Jorquera et al, 2019).
Research into how life prevails in such environments has generated
important discoveries and new levels of understanding about
biological adaptation and the evolution of life on Earth. Such
research has also provided a boon for biotechnology and related
commercial industries (Cavicchioli et al, 2011).
Recent advances in ‘omics technologies’ (i.e. techniques that are
used to evaluate the genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics of
organisms) has resulted in a rapid expansion in the investigation of
extremophile properties and their bioactive compounds, revealing
their relevance and application in multiple disciplines including
bioprospecting and biotechnology, medicine, bioenergy and
biofuels, bioinformatics, biomaterials, biosafety and biosecurity,
aquatic biotechnology, agriculture, environmental science, nano-
biotechnology, industrial process and more (Jorquera et al 2019).
In the academic literature the life and applications of extremophiles
(including, but not limited to psychrophiles – cold-adapted
organisms) has been the focus of special issues in the journals
‘Environmental Microbiology’ (Volume 13, Issue 8, 2011) and
‘Environmental Microbiology Reports’(Volume 16, Issue 6, 2014)
and a thematic issue in ‘Microbial Biotechnology’ (Volume 4, Issue
4, 2011).
The Journal ‘Extremophiles’ has published 158 articles on the
biochemistry, biotechnology or ecology of Antarctic microorganisms
since 2010, though (again) not all of these relate to the commercial
application of products.
A sampling of the literature reveals a wide range of genetic,
biochemical and biotechnological studies on Antarctic freshwater,
terrestrial, snow and ice, and marine organisms. These include, for
example:
archaea (Campanaro et al, 2010);
viruses (Luhtanen et al, 2018);
yeasts (Ferreira et al, 2019; Watanabe et al, 2014; Zisis et al, 2015;
Vlaev et al, 2013);
soil bacteria (Jiang et al, 2017; Bhave et al, 2013);
snow bacteria (Baricz et al, 2018);
freshwater bacteria (Das et al, 2019);
marine bacteria (Park and Kim, 2018; Eronen-Rasimus et al, 2017;
Kube et al, 2013);
fungi (Duran et al, 2019; Martorell et al, 2019; Godinho et al, 2015;
Melo et al, 2014);
lichen (Bhattarai et al, 2013; Paudel et al, 2011);
terrestrial invertebrates (Carapelli et al, 2014);
marine algae (Schulze et al, 2019; Gwak et al, 2010), and
higher plants (Koc et al, 2018).
Polar organisms have been referred to as being “enormous sources
of bioactivity compounds” (Liu et al, 2013). Compounds derived
from cold-adapted organisms have a wide range of commercial
applications. Their biomolecules, mainly proteins and enzymes
characterized by a high catalytic activity and pronounced heat-
lability, have already found useful applications in various domains
such as molecular biology, medical research, food or feed
technologies, as well as detergents and cosmetics (Margesin and
Feller, 2010).
A literature search revealed many examples since 2010 of studies
dedicated to the potential and realised commercial application of
products derived from Antarctic organisms, of which the following
are examples.
Medical applications
Over 200 patents have been filed related to the biotechnological
potential of Antarctic micro-organisms (Yarzábal, 2016) with
antimicrobial compounds being a particular focus (Lo Giudice and
Fani, 2016; Tedesco et al, 2016; Dimitrova et al, 2013).
Pigments obtained from bacteria isolated from freshwater lakes in
the Schirmacher Oasis have been shown to display useful
antibacterial properties (Mojib et al, 2010).
A compound extracted from the Antarctic cyanobacterium Nostoc
has demonstrated potent antibacterial activity including against
Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli and is
regarded as an enormous resource of therapeutic biomolecules for
future drug development (Liu et al, 2013).
Substances derived from Antarctic lichens have been shown to have
a number of medical applications (Kumar et al, 2014). Ramalin, a
secondary metabolite from the Antarctic lichen Ramalina terebrata
has been shown to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion
of colorectal cancer cells (Suh et al, 2017), as well as showing
potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Paudel et
al, 2011).
Food technology
The yeast Candida antarctica produces two lipases, A and B (lipases
being enzymes that break down fats). Lipase B is involved in a very
large number of organosynthesis applications related to food/feed
processing, pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics. In a 2005 survey of
patents related to Antarctica (Lohan and Johnston, 2005), it was
shown that lipases from C. antarctica dominate the number of
process- or product-based patents (Feller, 2013).
Cold-active enzymes such as antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and ice-
nucleating proteins (INPs), from Arctic and Antarctic bacteria have
been used in food processing to improve milk fermentation, to store
frozen yogurt, and to improve ice-cream production (Cid et al.,
2016; Feller, 2013).
Xylanase (a key ingredient of industrial bread dough conditioners)
from an Antarctic bacterium has been demonstrated to be very
effective in improving dough properties and final bread quality and
is a psychrophilic enzyme produced commercially in significant
volume (Feller, 2013).
Agriculture
Recent research has demonstrated that plant growth-promoting
rhizobacteria and endosymbiotic fungi isolated from an Antarctic
plant can effectively reduce the physiological impact of saline stress
in a salt-susceptible crops. Plants inoculated with microorganisms
collected from Antarctica increased the fitness related traits in
several crops (Acuña-Rodriguez et al, 2019).
Nutriceuticals
Antarctic marine bacterial isolates show significant potential as
cost-effective alternative sources of long-chain polyunsaturated
fatty acids that belong to the omega-3 group - essential fatty acids
in the human diet normally provided by fish and fish-derived
products (Bianchi et al, 2014).
Domestic products
Psychrophilic subtilisins (protein-digesting enzymes) isolated from
an Antarctic Bacillus species have been used to develop cold-active
subtilisins in washing detergents used in low temperature washes
(Feller, 2013).
Remediation of pollutants
Antarctic bacteria have been shown to have heavy metal resistance
and hydrocarbon degradation capabilities which are useful for
bioremediation in cold environments (Orellana et al, 2018).
Antarctic bacteria capable of degrading crude oil at low
temperatures, even below the freezing point, have also been
reported (Bowman and Deming, 2014).
The Antarctic yeast Pseudozyma antarctica produces enzymes with
useful application in the degradation of biodegradable plastics
(Watanabe et al, 2014).
******
There are many more examples in the literature that could be cited,
with Antarctic psychrophilic organisms demonstrating huge
potential with regard to an array of commercial applications.
Authors have commented that the field of application of these
organisms will be enlarged and open up many more new
opportunities in biotechnology because of their unique
characteristics and easy availability (Banerjee et al, 2016; Liu et al,
2013).
