Assessment of communication masking in Antarctic marine
mammals by airgun sound

Introduction
Underwater noise is, besides hazardous substances and nutrients,
one of the sources of marine pollution which is not yet sufficiently
investigated. It is also one of the key pollutants created by human
activities in the Southern Ocean. According to Erbe et al. 2019, "one
of the key pollutants created by human activities in the Antarctic is
noise, which is primarily caused by ship traffic (from tourism,
fisheries, and research), but also by geophysical research (e.g.,
seismic surveys) and by research station support activities
(including construction)." Broadband impulsive sounds of high
intensities are considered especially detrimental for the marine
environment. Marine airguns used for scientific seismic surveys
produce this kind of sound pulses that generates most of its energy
in the low frequency range.
Concern about potential impacts of anthropogenic sound in the
Southern Ocean was first raised at the ATCM in 2000 and has been
discussed most recently at ATCM XLII (SCAR WP 68 & BP 03,
published as a SCAR Bulletin in 2021). The need for alternative
sound sources (e.g. ATCM XXXIV IP 29 Potential of Technical
Measures to Reduce the Acoustical Effects of Airguns) and also for
seismic mitigation guidelines (e.g. ATCM XXX IP 80 Taking Action
on Marine Noise in the Southern Ocean) has been voiced. These
concerns are mirrored in two of the 80 most pressing questions
identified by SCARs Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Horizon
Scan undertaken in 2014 (Kennicutt et al. 2015): “How will
organism and ecosystems respond to a changing soundscape?” and
“What will be the impacts of large-scale, direct human modification
of the Antarctic environment?”.
Marine mammals highly depend on their sense of hearing. The
ability to acoustically perceive their environment is vital.
Anthropogenic underwater noise may interfere with communication
signals and prey, predator or natural sounds that are of importance
to the animal and therefore, ‘mask’ their ability to perceive these
biologically important sounds. Airguns mostly produce low
frequency sounds that correspond to the frequency range e.g.
Antarctic baleen whales predominantly use for communication.
Airguns have been considered for potentially deleterious effects in
close distances up to a few kilometres. Masking, however, was only
partly considered and only a few studies have considered masking
effects of airguns as a potentially adverse effect on marine
mammals in long distances.
Signals change their temporal structure (level, frequency content
and duration) as they radiate from the sound source. Airgun sounds
can travel vast distances in water. During this sound propagation
process, sound waves are reflected multiple times on the water
surface and diffracted in sound channels. Due to these processes the
frequency content of the received sound level in large distances
changes and the received signal is stretched and may cover the
whole time between airgun shots. Hence, the impulsive sound
source airgun can develop continuous properties and lead to a
general increase in background noise and furthermore to masking
effects over large distances.
The German Environment Agency (UBA) issued a 2-phased project
to evaluate the potential masking effects of scientific airgun use in
Antarctica to provide a sound scientific basis for permitting
geophysical surveys. Work has been carried out as an international
cooperation with institutes from Australia, Denmark, Germany,
Netherlands and USA.
Project Overview
The frequency range of seismic airgun signals overlaps with many
marine mammal vocalizations, especially the songs and calls of
baleen whales. Airguns may therefore mask the perception of
acoustic environmental cues as well as marine mammal
communication signals even at large distances from the airgun
location. This project assesses the communication masking potential
of airgun noise in the Southern Ocean using a modelling approach.
The first step includes propagation modelling of the airgun signals
over vast areas up to 2,000 km. To assess the impact of the received
airgun signals on the animal vocalisation, a masking model was
developed as the second evaluation step.
The first phase of the project ran from 2012 to 2013 (results in
Siebert et al. 2014, Wittekind et al. 2016). It started with
vocalisations from 3 species (blue whale, fin whale and Weddell
seal) and used a leaky integrator to model for the auditory
processes. The ‘leaky integrator’ accumulates the received energy
within the frequency band of the focal vocalization in a temporally
lossy manner. The accumulated energy levels of vocalization and
noise are analysed and compared to evaluate whether a signal can
be detected. The second phase (2015 to 2019) developed the
project and particularly the masking model further (results in
Gavrilov 2018, Wölfing et al. 2021, download at https://
www.umweltbundesamt.de/publikationen/assessment-of-
communication-masking-in-antarctic. The propagation model was
refined (from spherical spreading to a numerical model) and tested
with two datasets of airgun signals recorded in the Southern Ocean.
The range of tested vocalisations was expanded to include the
multiharmonic killer whale call. The auditory model was
significantly modified and changed (a. o.) from a band-pass leaky
integrator to a more specific spectrogram correlator. The
‘spectrogram correlator’ represents a phase-insensitive receiver. It
matches a representation of the incoming sound sample with a
spectral representation (a characteristic frequency and intensity
pattern) of the search signal and evaluates their similarity over
time. This principle functionally corresponds to the comparison of
the stimulation pattern of the cochlear output over time with a
search pattern of the signal. Finally, the detection model was
fundamentally changed. While the first phase directly compared
accumulated energy levels, the second phase used a fundamentally
different approach. Successful detection was assessed using
standardized classification theory (receiver operating characteristic
curve).
Results Overview
The output of the models shows that seismic surveys which are
conducted in lower latitudes outside the Antarctic Treaty area
(Australia) may even have masking potential in distant areas in
higher latitudes within the Antarctic Treaty area. As expected,
masking generally decreases (and communication ranges generally
increase) with growing distance from the airgun source. However,
as the transmitted total (airgun) energy does not decline
monotonously over distance to the source, the models indicate local
deviations from the general trend.
Results for numerous scenarios (5 different vocalisations, 2 ocean
depth, 3 receiver depth, 2 vocalisation depth, 6 ambient noise level
and 2 receiver models) were modelled for the project. The models
show that transmission loss depends on ocean depth and is
distinctly higher in the deep ocean scenarios. Consequently, the
effect ranges of airguns in deep ocean scenarios are generally higher
than in the shallow ocean. Different receiver depths produce
striking differences between the respective sound propagations due
to the influence of surface effects. This causes larger irregularities in
propagation close to the source at shallow receiver depths. The
effect ranges of airguns for 200 m receiver depth are distinctly
higher than for 10 m or 50 m receiver depth for e.g. communication
distances of blue whales and fin whales. The level of the propagated
sound originating from a depth of 5 m, is more attenuated than the
sound originating from a vocalization depth of 50 m for the low-
frequency transmission loss at long ranges. Thus, an increase in
communication ranges is expected for blue and fin whales if these
species vocalize at greater depths (50 m versus 5 m sender depth).
As expected, the effect range of airguns are generally larger in low
ambient ocean noise scenarios than in higher ocean noise scenarios.
Equally, predicted animal communication ranges rapidly decreases
as ambient noise level increases.
The model results indicate that seismic airgun sounds can lead to a
significant loss (close to 100 %) in communication range for blue
and fin whales up to 2,000 km from the source. However, the
intensity of the ambient noise is a relevant parameter. While the
model shows that airgun noise reduces communication ranges
severely (> 75 % loss) in low (80 dB) ambient noise scenarios, this
impact is drastically reduced in
higher ambient noise scenarios (90-112 dB). Nevertheless, for
medium distances from 50 – 200 km to the airgun, a significant
number of scenarios still predict severe (>75%) loss of
communication ranges compared to natural communication range

blue whale Z-call (vocalisation depth 50 m) for different water
depth, receiver depth and distance between airgun and listener.
Additionally, 4 different ambient noise conditions are incorporated
in the scenarios: quiet ambient noise conditions (80 dB), moderate
ambient noise (94 dB), medium ambient noise (102 dB) and high
ambient noise (112 dB). In phase I of the project only “quiet”
ambient noise conditions (80 dB) where included in the model.

For better visualization the output of the models for all scenarios (5
vocalisations, 2 ocean depth, 3 receiver depth, 2 vocalisation depth,
6 ambient noise level and 2 receiver models) have been visualized
with an interactive multimedia tool which provides a summary
overview, explanations and individual illustrations (https://
tschaffeld.shinyapps.io/UBA_mask). The tool provides overviews
like in figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Overview illustrations showing masking of Antarctic blue
whale z-calls by airgun noise. Graphs show the percentage loss in
communication distance relative to equivalent scenarios with no
airgun present and apply to medium ambient noise levels of 102 dB
(calling and listening animal at 50 m depth). The effect ranges of
airguns in the shallow ocean scenarios are generally lower than in
the deep ocean scenario.
Marine mammals have evolved to use sound as their primary
sensory modality. While there have been several other studies
modelling the propagation of airgun signals over large distances
(e.g. Kyhn et al. 2019) similar to this study, the masking model is
unique and allows for a more detailed evaluation of masking
impact. Any interference of acoustic communication can have
severe effects on both sender and receiver leading to impacts on
fitness, for example if masking impedes signal detection (e.g.
Branstetter et al. 2016). Behavioural responses can be highly
variable and may not be fully predictable with simple acoustic
exposure metrics e.g. like the received sound exposure level. While
disturbance responses have been studied in the field, this is much
more challenging with masking. Disturbance responses are often
associated with sudden changes in behaviour which can be
observed in the field. Masking however, may result in an observable
anti-masking strategy (cf. Blackwell et al. 2015, Thode et al. 2020)
as well as in a nonresponse due to a masked signal. Studying
masking based on behavioural observations requires knowledge on
how the animal behaves in the presence and absence of biological
cues. To validate the modelling results, further experimental studies
on masking effects are needed. Nevertheless, the current results are
already a valuable resource for the evaluation of acoustic masking
effects as they provide us with a better understanding of the
relationship between various parameters and their influence on
communication ranges of marine mammals in Antarctica.
