Framework for assessing ‘New, Novel or Particularly Concerning
Activities’
Framework for assessing ‘New, Novel or Particularly Concerning
Activities’
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
Following discussion at ATCM XLII on the development of a
framework for pre-assessment relating to new, novel or particularly
concerning activities, this paper provides an update on work the
United Kingdom has taken forward during the extended
intersessional period on how Parties might approach conducting
such an assessment and the key issues that might be taken into
consideration. The United Kingdom will take forward wider
informal discussions in the forthcoming intersessional period with a
view to submitting a Working Paper to ATCM XLIV in Berlin in
2022.
Background
ATCM XLII/WP 19 presented the Chairs’ report of an informal
workshop hosted by the UK and Netherlands in Rotterdam to
discuss tourism management in Antarctica. The workshop
considered recent trends in (pre-pandemic) Antarctic tourism and
focussed on three key areas related to tourism management: future
tourism growth; the diversification of tourism activities; and
enhancing compliance with existing Treaty regulations, guidance
and permit conditions.
The Rotterdam workshop discussed the question of whether there
are certain types of activity that simply should not be permitted in
Antarctica, either on the basis of considerable safety and
environmental concerns, or based on value considerations related to
the objectives and principles of the Antarctic Treaty and Protocol on
Environmental Protection. The discussion highlighted the challenge
for National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in considering proposed
activities that have not been conducted before, or conducted only
by a few operators, with applications often made with little time in
which to properly assess, or consult on, the likely risks and
environmental impacts. Additionally, different NCAs would
authorise certain activities in different ways. It was also recognised
that the cumulative impacts of certain activities could not properly
be assessed in the context of a single authorisation or application.
Concept of the need for a collective position
The workshop agreed that it would be helpful to establish a
mechanism for pre-assessment of the risks and impacts of new,
novel or particularly concerning activities, to provide guidance to
NCAs when they receive applications. Heli-skiing was identified as
the type of activity that would perhaps provide for a useful case
study in due course.
CEP XXII (Prague 2019) supported the workshop’s
recommendations and discussed the development of a framework
for conducting such pre-assessments. It agreed to:
include this as a priority activity in the CEP Five-Year Work Plan;
encourage CEP members and observers to work in the intersessional
period on such a framework, focussing on the environmental
aspects;
note particularly the importance of the framework for facilitating a
harmonised consideration of activities by national competent
authorities;
note that such a framework could appropriately also address issues
within the scope of ATCM discussions, and indicate its willingness
to participate in joint work.
ATCM XXII “strongly supported the recommendation to develop a
framework that would increase collaboration and the consistency of
the evaluation of new activities by competent authorities”. The
ATCM recognised that this framework would “improve
understanding of safety and environmental protection issues
associated with novel activities and thus assist competent
authorities in identifying appropriate mitigation efforts”. Finally,
the ATCM “noted that the CEP would undertake intersessional work
on the framework and encouraged further informal intersessional
consultations”.
Intersessional Work
During the extended intersessional period, the United Kingdom has
worked on developing an outline for a framework and identifying
relevant issues that would need to be taken into consideration in
the development of such a framework. Having only been able to
consult a small number of Parties during this intersessional period,
the United Kingdom plans to take forward wider informal
discussions during the forthcoming intersessional period 2021-22,
with a view to submitting a Working Paper to ATCM XLIV in Berlin
in 2022.
Considerations for a pre-assessment framework
Interaction between Pre-Assessment and Authorisation/EIA Process
Activities in Antarctica are subject to the Environment Impact
Assessment (EIA) provisions contained within Article 8 and Annex I
to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
The pre-assessment would be additional to that process, considering
a type of activity rather than a specific proposal, although it might
feed into the EIA process by providing guidance to NCAs or
recommending additional activity-specific guidance, as a way of
supporting the harmonisation of EIA processes between NCAs,
particularly where an NCA may have little prior experience
considering a particular type of activity.
It would allow for a broader strategic look at a proposed activity as
a whole, beyond any one specific proposal and including how
widely the activity is conducted in Antarctica, in order to be able to
consider whether an activity, or type of activity, raises particular
environmental, safety, or other concerns that might require or
benefit from a collective view among Parties. The assessment would
also facilitate consideration of issues such as cumulative impacts
and what additional management measures might be beneficial in
managing the growth and diversification of such types of activities
in Antarctica.
In the case of activities already conducted in Antarctica, the
assessment process could be informed by Parties’ experience of
considering that type of activity, or similar activities. Where
activities have not yet been conducted in Antarctica, the outcomes
of the assessment process could inform Parties’ approaches to
considering such proposals in future.
Process
While a framework could take several forms, the most pragmatic
approach might be for a Party, or group of interested Parties, to
conduct an assessment on a specific type of activity during the
intersessional period and prepare a WP for discussion at the ATCM/
CEP. This may result from discussions at the previous year’s ATCM/
CEP, or from their own initiative.
The WP could provide background and a statement of issues and/or
recommendations relevant to that activity, for debate involving all
Parties at the ATCM/CEP. After considering a pre-assessment, the
ATCM/CEP might determine that some form of regulation specific
to that type of activity should be developed or adopted; that
activity-specific guidance might usefully be developed or adopted;
or that no additional action is required with regard to that type of
activity.
Outputs
The proposed outputs contained in the WP could provide guidance
to support NCAs in their decision-making under their respective
national authorisation processes. This would also support the
harmonisation of authorisation processes among NCAs, and help
‘ensure consistent application of best practices and minimise
impacts to the Antarctic environment’, as for example, the CEP has
committed to in its Five-Year Work Plan in respect of short
overnight stays.
The WP assessment might therefore include:
an assessment of whether the proposed activity, or type of activity,
is consistent with the objectives and principles of the Antarctic
Treaty and the Environmental Protocol;
an assessment of the potential environmental impacts that could
occur as a result of the proposed activity, or type of activity;
a risk assessment that factors in safety concerns and informs the
likelihood of an environmental impact;
recommended mitigation measures that, if followed, would result in
the activity having less than a minor or transitory impact;
recommendations on limiting the activity if it is determined that
suitable mitigation measures are not available or possible.
These recommendations might include:
specific questions to be asked of those proposing to undertake an
activity;
certain minimum conditions that might be attached to the
authorisation of an activity, e.g., a higher number of guides per
visitor for a particular activity, or the presence of medical staff, or
the availability of safety equipment to a minimum standard;
geographical conditions, either in terms of where certain activities
should take place, or more relative in terms of wildlife, e.g., not
within a certain distance of breeding colonies;
additional activity-specific guidelines, following the precedent of
the Yachting Guidelines in Resolution 10 (2012);
new or amendments to existing Measures and/or Resolutions; e.g.,
incorporating activity-related guidance into existing General
Guidelines or Site Guidelines, or a recommendation to Parties that a
particular activity is not appropriate in Antarctica, or only
appropriate in certain circumstances.
The recommendations of the assessment would be submitted to the
ATCM/CEP for discussion under the relevant agenda items, where
the ATCM/CEP would then determine what actions might be
appropriate.
Criteria
The assessment might be based on the Environmental Principles
established under Article 3 of the Environmental Protocol as being
‘fundamental considerations in the planning and conduct of all
activities in the Antarctic Treaty area’:
The protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and
associated ecosystems and the intrinsic value of Antarctica,
including its wilderness and aesthetic values and its value as an
area for the conduct of scientific research…
These principles are further elaborated in the General Principles of
Antarctic Tourism, Resolution 7 (2009), in particular principles 2, 3
and 6:
Tourism should not be allowed to contribute to the long-term
degradation of the Antarctic environment and its dependent and
associated ecosystems, or the intrinsic natural wilderness and
historical values of Antarctica. In the absence of adequate
information about potential impacts, decisions on tourism should be
based on a pragmatic and precautionary approach, that also
incorporates an evaluation of risks;
Scientific research should be accorded priority in relation to all
tourism activities in Antarctica;
All tourism organisations should be encouraged to provide a focus
on the enrichment and education of visitors about the Antarctic
environment and its protection.
In considering the potential environmental impacts, the pre-
assessment would draw on existing EIA practice, including as set
out in Annex I to the Environmental Protocol.
The assessment should also consider the safety implications and
risks involved in conducting the proposed activity; such
considerations should include risks to those who would participate
in the proposed activity, as well as to those engaged in
governmental and in other tourist and non-governmental activities
in Antarctica.
Cumulative Impacts
In considering Cumulative Impacts, the pre-assessment might
explore the likely impacts of an activity, or type of activity, if it
were to be carried out more widely in future, whether repeatedly
over time and/or in multiple locations, to identify where the
activity may reach a tipping point beyond which it infringes either
values, safety, or environmental-based concerns, and what those
thresholds might be. Further consideration may be needed on
understanding how Antarctic values might be impacted by
particular activities.
Conclusion
A pre-assessment of new, novel or particularly concerning activities
might therefore consider:
The nature of the activity, how widely it is currently conducted in
Antarctica (if so), and potential future growth of such activity;
Whether the proposed activity would be consistent with the
objectives and principles of the Antarctic Treaty, its Protocol on
Environmental Protection, and the General Principles of Antarctic
Tourism;
Whether, and to what extent, the proposed activity, taking into
account possible cumulative impacts, contributes to the long-term
degradation of the intrinsic value of Antarctica, including its
wilderness and aesthetic values and its value as an area for the
conduct of scientific research;
An evaluation of risks involved in conducting the proposed activity,
whether to participants, to governmental activities, or to other
tourist and non-governmental operators in Antarctica;
Whether, and to what extent, the proposed activity interacts with,
and if so accords priority to, governmental or non-governmental
scientific research;
Whether existing regulations provide a ‘consistent framework for
the management of tourism’ in respect of the proposed activity, or
whether additional regulation is needed, including restrictions or
conditions;
Examples of existing practice on environmental and safety
management issues from NCAs currently authorising the proposed
activity, and what ‘best practice’ would be, in order to facilitate the
harmonisation of authorisation processes;
Whether, and to what extent, the proposed activity provides a focus
on the enrichment and education of visitors about the Antarctic
environment and its protection.
The United Kingdom looks forward to engaging in informal
discussions with Parties during the forthcoming intersessional
period 2021-22 on the development of a pre-assessment framework
for new, novel or particularly concerning activities, including
through the Competent Authorities forum. We would also welcome
any comments on the progress to date, as set out in this paper,
