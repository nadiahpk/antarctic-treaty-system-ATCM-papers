Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in
2019-20 and 2020-21
Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in
2019-20 and 2020-21
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina,
Chile and the International Association of Antarctica Tour
Operators (IAATO)
Summary
Since 2010, the United Kingdom and IAATO have provided reports
to the ATCM about the number of yachts sighted in the Antarctic
during each previous season, while Argentina has provided reports
detailing yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia. From 2016
Chile, Argentina, the United Kingdom and IAATO have presented a
joint paper (ATCM XXXIX/WP34, ATCM XL/WP19, ATCM XLI/
IP55, and ATCM XLII/IP107).
This paper consolidates information from the United Kingdom,
Argentina, Chile and IAATO relating to yachts sighted in Antarctica,
or indicating an intention to travel to Antarctica, during the
2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons.
Background
The ATCM has previously welcomed information about yachts
sighted in or planning to travel to Antarctica. This has enabled
Parties to consider the overall volume of yachts known to be
visiting the continent, and to confirm whether appropriate
authorisations for such activities had been obtained.
As in previous years, this paper includes information collected as
part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and
vessels) at the UK-operated base Port Lockroy; information from
Argentina on yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia, as well
as yachts visiting Argentine-operated Brown station; information
provided by Chile based on details recorded from yachts indicating
an intention to travel from Puerto Williams/Punta Arenas to
Antarctica; and incidental sightings recorded by IAATO members
and other vessels in Antarctica. It would be helpful if Parties could
provide any supplementary material, which adds to or verifies this
information.
A total of 43 yachts were sighted in, or reported an intention to sail
to, Antarctica during the 2019-20 season. This represented a
decrease from the 50 reported in 2018-19. 16 of these were IAATO
members (table 1); 16 were non-IAATO members but had Party
authorisation to travel to Antarctica (table 2); and 11 vessels appear
to the cosponsors to be unauthorised vessels (table 3).
The 2020-21 season was significantly affected by the global
COVID-19 pandemic, with travel restrictions and quarantine
requirements reducing the number of yachts travelling to
Antarctica. A total of 8 yachts were sighted in, or reported an
intention to sail to, Antarctica during the 2020-21 season. This
represented a decrease from the 43 reported in 2019-20. 3 of these
were IAATO members (table 4); and 5 were non-IAATO members
but had Party authorisation to travel to Antarctica (table 5).
Parties are reminded that the EIES contains a summarised reporting
tool, which can generate a complete list of all vessels included in
pre-season information as having obtained authorisation to operate
in Antarctica (https://www.ats.aq/devAS/InformationExchange/
SummarizedReports?lang=e). This facility makes it much easier to
determine whether a yacht is authorised, and consequently, this
may be a useful tool for use in-season to expedite the verification of
the authorisation status of any sighted yachts. Parties are therefore
requested to ensure that the EIES is updated regularly to include all
authorised tourism vessels.
Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom,
Argentina, Chile and IAATO believe that it is important that the
ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting activities in
Antarctica and encourages Parties to share information about yachts
they have authorised through the EIES Pre-Season Information
facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with Resolution 5
(2005). We would also point to the
continued activity of yachts that have been operating in the region
without authorisation from a Treaty Party. We urge the ATCM to
consider further the matter of unauthorised yachts.
