A Five-Year Overview and 2020–21 Season Report on IAATO
Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM
Visitor Site Guidelines
Information Paper submitted by IAATO
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM
information on IAATO Operator Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines use. This information paper presents data collected by
IAATO from IAATO Operator Post Visit Report Forms for the
Antarctic Peninsula during the 2020–21 season. No non-IAATO
visits are included in this analysis.
In addition to our annual data sets, building on discussions with
different Treaty Parties around growth, we have included some
historical data which may aid in future discussions around site
usage.
It is important to note, due to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, IAATO
Operator expeditions during the 2020–21 season were limited to
two individual expeditions on the Antarctic Peninsula, comprised of
three yachts, and statistics for the 2020–21 season represent an
irregularity. For this reason, most data sets in this paper review
seasons 2015–20 for a more accurate statistical overview.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found
in ATCM XLIII_IPxx IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: A
Historical Review of Growth, the 2020–21 Season, and Preliminary
Estimates for 2021–22, and on the IAATO website https://
iaato.org/information-resources/data-statistics/.
Historic Overview of Antarctic Peninsula traditional seaborne
tourism
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional
commercial seaborne (SOLAS Vessels) tourism in the Antarctic
Peninsula, which accounts for over 95% of all landed activity.
A SOLAS vessel (as defined in Maritime Rule Part 21) is any ship to
which the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea
1974 applies; namely: a passenger ship engaged on an international
voyage, or a non-passenger ship of 500 tons gross tonnage or more
engaged on an international voyage. In this paper’s number
analysis, yacht (vessels carrying 12 passengers or less) numbers are
only included where specifically mentioned.
Figure 1: Factor Change in Traditional Landing Ship-borne Tourism
in the Antarctic Peninsula 1989–2021 provides a comparison of the
factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of
passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used).
Figure 1: Factor Change in Traditional Landing Ship-borne Tourism
in the Antarctic Peninsula 1989–2021.
During the last representative season (2019–2020) all traditional
commercial seaborne tourism with landings around the Peninsula
was conducted by IAATO Operators. Whilst it is difficult to say
when activities will return to pre-pandemic levels, planning and
preparation for the resumption of activity and management for
future growth continues as it has over the last 30 years. Table 1
shows the industry growth over the period 2015–2020, and
potential number of passengers and voyages for 2021–22.

Since the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters
(Polar Code) was adopted, there has been substantial investment by
operators in existing and new build vessels. The 2019–20 season
saw the first SOLAS vessels built after the Polar Code came into
force in January 2017. The forecast increase is reflective of vessels
which were planned and ordered between 2016–18 following the
adoption of the Polar Code.
Some new vessels scheduled for the 2020–21 season were delayed
due to the pandemic. The potential increase for the 2021–22 season
reflects the combination of vessels launched over the last two years.
The continued growth in activity is driven by increased interest and
awareness of Antarctica resulting in a desire by many of the public
to experience the region first hand.
The 2020–21 season of Antarctic tourist activites was effectively
cancelled as a result of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. How and when
the industry will recover is yet to be seen, but the pandemic will
continue to affect IAATO Operator activities for the 2021–22 season
and possibly beyond. Ultimately, actual operation of vessels will not
only depend on Antarctic Gateway protocols but worldwide travel
restrictions and/or protocols.
Should the season go ahead, the IAATO fleet would see a net
increase by ten SOLAS vessels during the 2021–22 season
(Appendix I) bringing the total number of vessels to 47. Appendix I
details, by vessel name and type, which vessels are joining and
leaving the IAATO fleet in the next two seasons should activities
proceed.
Prior to the pandemic, vessels were being operated with a higher
percentage of capacity occupied, with all vessels benefiting from the
world’s economic strength and operating at near-full passenger
capacity.
As new vessels are introduced into the IAATO fleet, the average
vessel passenger capacity has increased, with many of the Category
1 vessels being added now carrying up to 200 passengers.
Analysis of site use and activities (found in ATCM XLIII_IPxx IAATO
Overview of Antarctic Tourism: A Historical Review of Growth, the
2020–21 Season, and Preliminary Estimates for 2021–22) has found
Operators are responding to IAATO’s multi layered strategy to
encourage operators to spread activities across a range of platforms
– ship cruising, Zodiac cruising, kayaking, etc. in order to reduce
activities at landing sites. IAATO has encouraged this practice since
2012 and strengthened the effort during our 2019 Annual Meeting
by incorporating into our Bylaws a new Code of Conduct for
Vessels.
Specific Landing Site Use
The top five visited sites (Neko Harbour, Cuverville Island,
Halfmoon Island - Chinstrap Colony, Whalers Bay and Goudier
Island) have remained the same from 2015–2020. These sites
account for approximately 25% of all landings made during the
five-year period. The top twenty most-visited sites accounted for
approximately 65% of all landings each season.
Appendix II lists the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made
from 2015–2020
Figure 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all
sites within the Antarctic Peninsula over a five year period (2015–
2020). Landings occurred over a period of approximately 160 days
from October to March.
Figure 2: Total number of landings made per day at all sites within
the Antarctic Peninsula over a five-year period (2015–2020).
There is variation in levels of activity. These peaks and troughs are
remarkably similar from season to season, and demonstrate the
fluctuations in levels of visitation, resulting from schedules for
expeditions considering the holiday season breaks.
Additional tourism statistics are available on the IAATO website:
https://iaato.org/information-resources/data-statistics/
Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines
Appendix III provides a five year analysis of the total number of
known landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines. An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the
ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines was conducted through an analysis of
the ATCM Post Visit Report Forms for traditional commercial ship-
borne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula.
Conclusion
The information extracted from these ATCM Post Visit Report forms
for traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic
Peninsula shows that while overall tourism levels continued to rise
prior to the pandemic, the increase is not uniform across all visitor
sites as demonstrated in Appendix II. A few sites continuing to
prove very popular with a greater increase in activity, while some
other sites actually saw a decrease in activity. The pattern of
concentrated increase is believed to be partially explained by the
popularity of these sites for their reliable access, ease of visitor
management and aesthetic value and historic interest. Additionally,
factors such as ice patterns and weather strongly contribute to site
selection and visitation patterns by either allowing or restricting
access.
All of the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by
ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Program
Management guidelines.
It is important to note the 2021–22 season was greatly affected by
the pandemic, and do not reflect recent tourism trends, as
mentioned in Appendix IV.
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP
and ATCM on its Operators’ activities. In addition, IAATO Operators
remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of
ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
