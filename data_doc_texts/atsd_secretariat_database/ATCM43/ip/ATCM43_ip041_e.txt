A review of the activities conducted by Italy in support of the
established CCAMLR Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area
(RSRMPA)
Information Paper submitted by Italy
Abstract
The approved Resolution 5 Establishment of the Ross Sea Region
Marine Protected Area (ATCM XL - 2017) recommended that Parties
identify opportunities to conduct and support relevant research and
monitoring activities that support the objectives and the
forthcoming Research and Monitoring Plan of the RSRMPA, in
particular through international collaborations. In this paper, an
overview on the science developed by Italy in support of the
RSRMPA is presented, in addition to the work done in the past on
ASPAs including a marine component (ASPA 161, ASPA 165, ASPA
173, Inexpressible Island ASPA proposal).
Italy’s aim is to promote knowledge of Italian activities and of the
ongoing international collaborations thus helping harmonization of
research initiatives in the Ross Sea Area. The available research
infrastructures are also presented.
1. Introduction
Since 1985, vessel-based as well as land-based marine researches
have been developed in the Western Ross Sea under the umbrella of
the Italian National Antarctic Program (PNRA), especially in Terra
Nova Bay where the Italian ‘Mario Zucchelli Station’ (MZS, formerly
‘Terra Nova Bay Station’) is located. A general overview of the
activities was presented in the frame of the first CCAMLR MPA
Workshop (2011, Brest, France) (CCAMLR WS-MPA-11/14). In
2017, after the agreement by CCAMLR of the Ross Sea Region MPA
(RSRMPA), an update on the PNRA supported scientific activities
relevant for evaluating the performance of the RSRMPA was
provided (CCAMLR WS-RMP-17/10) during the CCAMLR Ross Sea
region MPA Research and Monitoring Plan Workshop (2017, Rome,
Italy).
During the last five years, the PNRA has put in efforts over research
and monitoring in the RSRMPA. In addition to the activities
conducted in the frame of the Italian Marine Observatory in the
Ross Sea (MORSea, http://morsea.uniparthenope.it) available since
1994, and to the hydrographic activities conducted for over 30
years in collaboration with the Italian Hydrographic Institute (IP 48
- ATCM XLII), new research projects in the region have been
supported. Recently, the available research infrastructures were
updated and a platform for marine research, the research vessel
Laura Bassi, is now available.
2. Scientific Projects
In 2016, Italy was leading research in the Ross Sea in the frame of
27 PNRA supported projects addressing a wide range of topics
associated to the RSR-MPA, including among others the physical,
biological and ecological changes in habitats and communities
related to climate change, sea-ice variations, and changes of the
ocean circulation; biodiversity mapping; distribution of spawning
and nursery areas for the Antarctic silverfish, distributions and
movements of Antarctic toothfish, and monitoring of the Adélie
penguin.
Two years later a new call for proposal was launched by the PNRA,
that allocated a specific financial support to scientific activities
focusing on the priorities identified in the CCAMLR CM 91-05
Annex C, researches pursuant to the specific objectives of the
RSRMPA, and monitoring to evaluate the extent to which these
objectives are being achieved. Fifteen new research projects were
selected, four vessel-based projects implemented on the RV Laura
Bassi, and 11 coastal land-based activities at Terra Nova Bay,
relying on the logistic support from the Italian Mario Zucchelli
Station.
Evaluation of new proposals for researches in the Ross Sea is
currently in progress, and novel scientific activities are foreseen to
start by the end of this year.
A summary of the completed and new projects is given in Table 1.
Graphic representation by specific objective number of the RSRMPA
(CM 91-05, paragraph 3) is shown in Figure 1.

3. Scientific Results
A census of the recent (2016-today) Italian scientific production
related to the Oceanography, Biology and Ecology of the Ross Sea
reported 103 publications (Source: Scopus; export date: 7 May
2021; Search criteria: “Ross Sea” in “Title, Abstract, Key words” +
“Italy” in “Affiliation Country” + “>2015” in “date range”).
Records were manually checked, and publications purely related to
paleo-records or other research fields not-relevant for the present IP
(51 publications in total) were manually excluded from the list.
Among the 103 selected publications, 95 (92.2%) were primary
Research articles, 3 (2.9%) were Reviews, 3 (2.9%) were
Conference papers, and 2 (1.9%) were Editorials. This indicates that
the recent Italian scientific production was strongly devoted to the
generation of new data for the Ross Sea Region. With reference to
research topics relevant for the research and management of the
Ross Sea Region MPA, 27 publications (26.2%) were primarily
related to “Climate change and oceanography”, 27 (26.2%) to
“Ecosystem structure and functioning, including food webs”, 19
(18.4%) to “Biodiversity”, 13 (12.6%) to “Pollution”, 8 (7.8%) to
“Pelagic prey species” (Krill and the Antarctic silverfish), 7 (6.8%)
to “Top predators”, and 5 (4.8%) to the “Antarctic toothfish”
(please consider that in few cases a given publication was assigned
to more than one
topic). Published researches were related to the sea ice, pelagic and
benthic compartments, as well as to the physical and ecological
interconnections among compartments.
Notably, Authors affiliated to Institutions belonging to foreign
Countries/Territories were included in 41 publications (39.8%),
indicating that the research activity in the Ross Sea Region was a
strong catalyzer of scientific international collaborations in recent
years. Specifically, 98 Institutions belonging to 22 foreign
Countries/Territories were represented. Among the most
represented: New Zealand (in 16 publications), United Sates (15),
United Kingdom (11), Australia (6), Germany (5), Canada (4),
South Korea (4), China (3), France (3), Norway (3), and Spain (3).
With reference to the different research topics, “Climate change and
oceanography” and “Ecosystem structure and functioning, including
food webs”, resulted in highest number of publications
characterized by international collaborations (12 and 9
publications, respectively), followed by “Biodiversity” (8), “Pelagic
prey species” (5), “Antarctic toothfish” (4), “Top predators” (3) and
“Pollution” (3).
4. Available infrastructures
Research conducted on the topics indicated in Table 1 can rely on
the support of both Mario Zucchelli Station and the Research Vessel
Laura Bassi, purchased in 2019 by the Italian OGS Institute being
equipped with scientific instrumentation (see https://
www.eurofleets.eu/vessel/rv-laura-bassi/). A web site developed by
ENEA allows visualizing the tracks of the RV Italica and RV Laura
Bassi as well as the sampling points of the different research
projects conducted since 2015: https://myway.enea.it/Myway_all/
Welcome.action?request_locale=en (from 2015 to 2020) and
https://myway.enea.it/MAH_36/Welcome.action?
request_locale=en (2020-2021).
At MZS modernization works are under way and the revamping of
laboratories ended in the last Antarctic summer campaign. New
laboratories are now available in addition to a new aquarium.
In a 80m2 area, the new aquarium is equipped has 24 m3 of total
water capacity and will allow rearing of collected marine
organisms.
The following tanks are available:
- n. 7 water tanks (200x90xH80 cm)
- n.18 water tanks (100x40xH50 cm)
- n. 8 water tanks (50x50xH50 cm)
- n.1 circular tank (300 cm diameter, H 110 cm)
The facility offers the possibility to regulate water temperature and
dissolved gases separately and for specific groups of tanks.
5. Conclusive remarks
Since the establishment of the RSR MPA, the Italian scientific
activities have been improved: 42 Italy led research projects are
ongoing, and novel projects are soon to be launched. Such an effort
has led to significant advancements in a range of topics of interest
for the RSRMPA, and strongly catalysed scientific international
collaborations, as testified by over a hundred publications in
international peer reviewed scientific journals. The provided
overview is intended as a contribution to foster international
collaborations and to harmonize researches in the Ross Sea, in
agreement with the Resolution 5 /ATCM XL – 2017).
