New Legislation for Turkish Polar Scientific Expeditions
Information Paper submitted by Turkey
Summary
This paper gives a brief report on Turkey’s new legislation for
Turkish Polar Scientific Expeditions titled “Procedures and
Principles on Turkish Polar Science Expeditions and Activities”.
Introduction
The polar regions are home to a scientific research environment
that will shed light on the past and future of the world. In order to
benefit from this efficient research environment, countries organize
scientific expeditions to the polar regions at regular intervals. The
fact that logistical and technical support was extremely limited
during the science expeditions resulted in the emergence of certain
rules and flows to be applied at the expedition.
On 15 September 2020, “Procedures and Principles on Turkish
Polar Science Expeditions and Activities” was issued and entered
into force as a part of the Scientific and Technological Research
Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) legislation.
The purpose of these Procedures and Principles is to determine the
procedures and principles of any activities, studies, transactions and
operations about the on-site conduct of Turkish Polar Scientific
Expeditions, in the Antarctic Treaty Zone and the Arctic, under the
coordination of TUBITAK Marmara Research Center (MAM) Polar
Research Institute (PRI). In line with these procedures, principles
and planned targets, the scope of the new legislation covers the
authorities, duties and responsibilities of the persons participating
in expeditions to ensure a safe operation.
