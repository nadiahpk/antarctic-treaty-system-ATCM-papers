Global Wild Plant Seed Vault
Information Paper submitted by Italy
1. Summary
The purpose of this paper is to present the Seeds for Future (SFF)
project within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting (ATCM) for establishing a Global Wild Plant Seed Vault in
the Antarctic Plateau ice depth.
According to the State of the World's Plants 2020, the total number
of known wild vascular plant species is about 350,000 but scientists
say that 43.7% of all plant species (more than 150,000) are likely
threatened with extinction. Several seed banks have been
established in the World, preserving the germplasm of hundreds of
thousand species. The rationale of preserving seeds of endangered
plants in Antarctica lies in the possibility to recover extinct species
in the event of the loss of germplasm stored elsewhere.
2. Background
Banking the world’s seeds will give an insurance policy against the
extinction of plants in the wild and protects our botanical heritage
for future generations.
Establishing a Global Wild Plant Seed Vault in Antarctica, the most
reliable natural freezer, is an effort to secure the safe storage of
seeds of the most threatened plant species in the world,
contributing to the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation and
tackling the challenges of food security, sustainable energy, loss of
biodiversity and climate change.
The SFF project idea was launched in Italy and France in 2019. Its
international dimension has grown with the declaration of support
of the IUCN Species Survival Commission which “…consider the
proposal to be of utmost importance for the conservation of plant
diversity and the future of our planet”, and of national and
international seed bank networks.
The international scientific community is now working to make it a
global initiative in the coming years.
During the development of the project, a governance plan, agreed
by the ATCM parties, is needed to contribute to the long-term
storage of seeds of threatened wild plants in Antarctica, particularly
to ensure this complies with the Antarctic Treaty and the Madrid
Protocol.
3. Goals of the SFF project
The SFF project aims to:
Collect seed lots of wild threatened plants from all over the world
before their extinction.
Store these seed lots on a long-term basis (possibly hundreds of
years) for future generations of scientists and humanity in general.
The scientific feasibility of the proposal is guaranteed by the
collaboration with international experts in seed cryobiology and
cryopreservation, like Prof. Hugh W. Pritchard (Head of the
Comparative Seed Biology Group, Millennium Seed Bank, Royal
Botanic Gardens, Kew).
The goal of the SFF project is to ensure the safest cold storage of the
seeds of wild threatened plants from all over the world collected for
this project. Safe storage should be guaranteed for the longest
possible periods, possibly up to several centuries.
4. Design of the seeds repository
To ensure optimal storage conditions for the seed lots, not only
must the temperature be kept below zero, but temperature
variations must also be avoided. For this reason, the SFF project
will involve the storage of the seeds at approximately 10 metres
depth. At this depth, the snow temperature corresponds to the mean
annual temperature for any given site, preventing seasonal
temperature variations (e.g. -56°C at Concordia Station).
For storing SFF, here we propose the ice caves (or balloon caves)
under experimental tests in Concordia Station (see Figure 1). This
concept has a low environmental impact during both construction
and decommissioning. The ice caves are obtained in approximately
seven working days by putting thin layers of snow (using a
snowblower) over an inflatable balloon that is deflated and
removed once the roof is solid, leaving the ice cave. Initially, the
access to these caves could be via a slope that will be buried once
the cave closed, and then via trap doors prepared in the upper part
during construction.
The ice cave needed is about 5 m in diameter and will host one or
two 20ft ISO intermodal containers with a volume of about 33 m3
each, equipped with shelves for long-term storage. Seeds
repositories should have a storage capacity of up to 80,000 seed
lots. Seeds safe storage at such a low temperature will be
guaranteed using sealed, unbreakable air-tight cryogenic PTFE
containers of various dimensions preserved in sealed steel boxes.
As the life span of an ice cave cannot be considered indefinite, this
system would require that every 7-10 years the ice caves are rebuilt
and the containers on sledges taken off the old ones and placed
inside the new ones.
Such facilities are supposed to keep seeds safe for hundreds of years
without human oversight with no need to access the stored seed
lots, except in case of need for withdrawal.

5. Final remarks
What precedes is an introductory presentation of the Seeds for
Future project. Italy reserves to present the next ATCM in 2022
with a working paper containing all relevant details of this
initiative in order to obtain the necessary guidance from ATCM and
CEP.
