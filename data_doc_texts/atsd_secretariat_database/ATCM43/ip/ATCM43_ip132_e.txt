Brazilian Hydrographic Surveying of Antarctic Waters
Brazilian Hydrographic Surveying of Antarctic Waters
Summary
This Information Paper summarizes the recent work done by the
Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN) of the Brazilian
Navy, the competent national authority with regard to nautical
chart production. DHN represents Brazil at the International
Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and is responsible for collecting,
processing and distributing information related to safety of
navigation. The Directorate also offers hydrographic and
oceanographic services in the Antarctic Peninsula region.
Introduction
Brazil has been present in Antarctica with a governmental scientific
programme since 1982, and DHN operates the ships assigned to the
Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR). PROANTAR is fully
supported by Brazilian Navy vessels and Brazilian Air Force aircraft.
The first expeditions were conducted with the support of the
Oceanographic Support Ship “Barão de Teffé”, which was replaced
in 1994 by the Oceanographic Support Ship “Ary Rongel”. Since
2014 also Polar Ship “Almirante Maximiano” supports the Brazilian
Antarctic Program.
In 1983, the first Brazilian hydrographic survey was carried out in
Antarctica, which resulted in the publication of the first edition of
nautical chart 25121 of Admiralty Bay, on King George Island, one
year later.
In 2013, DHN developed the Antarctic Hydrographic Data
Collection Plan in order to systematize the acquisition of
bathymetric and tidal data under responsibility of Brazil for the
production and updating of cartographic documents in the Antarctic
region, with emphasis on the maritime areas where Brazilian
scientific activities are conducted.
Since 2016, the Brazilian Cartographic Plan for Antarctica is part of
the Brazilian Nautical Cartographic Plan, and its hydrographic and
cartographic production activities are reviewed every four years.
DHN has produced 6 nautical paper charts, 4 international nautical
charts (INT charts), and 5 electronic nautical charts (ENC) covering
Antarctic waters. The online catalogue of national charts is
available at the following link: https://www.marinha.mil.br/chm/
dados-do-segnav/cartas-raster
Efforts to address the nautical charting challenges in Antarctica
require considerable investment, and strong international
cooperation and coordination. The hydrographic offices of
Argentina, Chile, Peru and the United Kingdom have cooperated
closely with the Brazilian Navy in surveys and hydrographic
activities in the Antarctic Peninsula region.
Activities
Historically, the DHN hydrographic data collection have been
conducted in the region close to the Comandante Ferraz Antarctic
Station (EACF), in Admiralty Bay, on the Keller Peninsula and in
the vicinity of Elephant Island. Most of the Brazilian scientific
activities are carried out in these places.
According to IHO reports, there are limitations of hydrographic
knowledge in Antarctica and it is known that those unsurveyed
waters pose serious risks for maritime incidents. To contribute to
the current efforts of hydrographic mapping of Antarctic waters,
DHN has been carried out hydrographic surveys on maritime
shipping routes as established by the IHO Hydrographic
Commission on Antarctica (HCA), which will contribute to the
publication of two more INT charts on 1:200.000 scale in
cooperation with the Chilean Hydrographic Service.
Geographical limits of interest and Brazilian chart size for
Antarctica, according to IHO agreements, are included in The
Brazilian Cartographic Plan for Antarctica (see Table 1).

During OPERANTAR XXXVI (2018), the Oceanographic Support
Ship "Ary Rongel" DHN has conducted hydrographic surveys in the
Maxwell Bay (picture on the left below) and the Admiralty Bay
(picture on the right). These hydrographic surveys were used to
update 25122 and 25121 (INT 9125) charts, respectively.

In 2019 (OPERANTAR XXXVII), the Polar Ship "Almirante
Maximiano" completed the hydrographic data acquisition in King
George Bay (KGI) for the update of the nautical chart 25120 (INT
9126).

The Polar Ship “Almirante Maximiano” conducted hydrographic
surveys during OPERANTAR XXXVIII in the vicinity of Maxwell
Bay, southeast of Nelson Island, as illustrated in the figures below,
being part of the work that will enable the updating of nautical
chart 25122.

In the same period (2020) the Polar Ship “Almirante Maximiano”
carried out two shoal investigations in the Admiralty Bay, as shown

In December 2020, a Spotter-V2 buoy was anchored in the vicinity
of the Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station (EACF), at coordinates
62° 12' 34.258" S and 58° 16' 48.180" W. Launched by the Polar
Ship “Almirante Maximiano”, the Antarctic buoy is part of an
experiment made by the Navy Hydrography Center in partnership
with Petrobras, the Brazilian energy company, within the scope of
the REMO observational Project, to perform remote monitoring of
the waves, wind and surface temperature of the sea. The
meteoceanographic data collected is available in real time, thus
providing vital information to support the Brazilian Navy
operations in that region. The information is free and available to
other national Antarctic programs and the scientific community
through the Marine Meteorological Service: www.marinha.mil.br/
chm/dados-do-goos-brasil/pnboia-mapa
Brazil also offers a contribution to IHO on the production and
updating of Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) in the Antarctic
region. These Brazilian ENCs can be obtained through the IC-ENC
(www.ic-enc.org), which is one of the Regional ENCs Coordination
Centers (RENC), or through the company EMGEPRON (https://
cartasnauticasbrasil.com.br/geoportal/web/niceindex.html), which
acts as a value added reseller (VAR) for RENC PRIMAR.

Final Observations
During the 39 years of collaboration with the Brazilian Antarctic
Program, the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the
Brazilian Navy has sought to contribute to the collection of
bathymetric and cartographic data of Antarctic waters, as
established by the International Hydrographic Organization,
improving navigation security, scientific and logistical support,
safeguarding life at sea and protection of the marine environment of
that region.
