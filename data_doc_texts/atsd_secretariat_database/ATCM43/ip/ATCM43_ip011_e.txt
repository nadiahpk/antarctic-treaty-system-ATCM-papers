Annual Report for 2020/21 of the Council of Managers of National
Antarctic Programs (COMNAP)
Annual Report for 2020/21 of COMNAP
15 March 2020 – 30 June 2021
Background Information
Our Membership
Formally established on 15 September 1988, COMNAP brings
together the national officials responsible for planning, conducting
and managing support to Antarctic research on behalf of their
respective governments. COMNAP is an international association
whose Members are the 30 National Antarctic Programs from the
countries of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile,
China, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, India,
Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland,
Republic of Belarus, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, South
Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States and
Uruguay. The National Antarctic Programs of Canada (from August
2016), Colombia (from April 2021), Malaysia (from August 2017),
Portugal (from August 2015), Switzerland (from April 2018),
Turkey (from April 2018) and Venezuela (from August 2015) are
COMNAP Observers.
Our Purpose
COMNAP's purpose is to develop and promote best practice in
managing the support of scientific research in the Antarctic. As an
organisation, COMNAP acts to add value to National Antarctic
Programs’ efforts by serving as a forum to develop practices that
improve effectiveness of activities in an environmentally
responsible manner, by facilitating international partnerships, and
through information exchange.
COMNAP strives to provide the Antarctic Treaty System with
objective, practical, technical and non-political advice drawn from
the National Antarctic Programs' expertise and their first-hand
Antarctic knowledge, contributing 38 Working Papers, 121
Information Papers to date.
Our Leadership
COMNAP is a Member-driven organisation with an elected
Executive Committee (EXCOM) led by Dr Kelly K. Falkner (US
Antarctic Program) as Chair, with Vice Chairs Manuel Burgos
(Uruguayan Antarctic Institute), John Guldahl (Norwegian Polar
Institute), Agnieszka Kruszewska (Institute of Biochemistry and
Biophysics Polish Academy of Sciences), Uwe Nixdorf (Alfred
Wegener Institute (AWI) Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine
Research, Germany) and Gen Hashida (National Institute of Polar
Research, Japan). Michelle Rogan-Finnemore is the Executive
Secretary. The University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New
Zealand, hosts the COMNAP Secretariat under a renewed MOU
through September 2027.
COMNAP Operations 2020/2021: Proactively addressing challenges
COVID-19 Preparedness
Recognising the severity of the emerging global situation, the
COMNAP EXCOM met online under urgency on 9 March 2020. The
meeting had only one agenda item and objective, to: “Focus on
devising a strategy that collectively strengthens national efforts to
avoid introducing the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease to
Antarctica; Outline major points of consideration for our collective
strategy and action items toward an implementation plan; Ensure
we are engaging as EXCOM with the COMNAP Membership in
regards to information exchange on COVID-19 and also with others
in the Antarctic community (in particular with IAATO), on
prevention practices, ability to respond on Antarctic stations, and
media/communications plans.”
On 9 March 2020, three days before the WHO declared the
COVID-19 pandemic, the EXCOM established the COVID-19 ad hoc
Sub-committee led by Dr Tim Heitland (AWI) with Dr Pradip
Malhotra (NCPOR, India) and Dr Fabio Catalano (ENEA, Italy) and
in collaboration with Dr Anne Hicks (BASMU, UK, & the Joint
Expert Group on Human Biology and Medicine (JEGHBM) Leader).
With the Executive Secretary, the
Sub-committee developed the “COMNAP SARS‐CoV‐2 / COVID‐19
Recommendations (non‐mandatory) in the context of Antarctic
Operations” Working Paper (released 16 March 2020). The key
message was “Act Early, Act Strongly as containment and
prevention must be the priority to prevent introduction of SARS-
CoV-19 in Antarctica.”
The Sub-committee remains convened and the guidelines, now
known as the “COMNAP COVID-19 Outbreak Prevention &
Management Guidelines” (version 14 January 2021) continue to be
reviewed and evolved based on current research, WHO guidance
and the situation globally. Regular and open communications
continue with our Members, Observers and other stakeholders.
Planning for medical emergency and response is a risk addressed in
National Antarctic Program planning in normal circumstances. The
2020/2021 Antarctic season, however, was unprecedented. The
inability to respond to a highly infectious novel virus with
significant mortality and morbidity in the extreme and austere
environment of Antarctica with limited sophistication of medical
care and public health responses was identified early. Therefore,
National Antarctic Programs were proactive in their recognition of
the importance of a rapid development and implementation of
COVID-19 protocols.
COMNAP programs prioritise safety of human life in all planning,
operations, and activities. All National Antarctic Programs acted to
mitigate the risk presented by the global pandemic. Several
programs cancelled their 2020/21 Antarctic seasons. The majority
significantly reduced their planned activity while continuing to
maintain critical Antarctic infrastructures, exchange personnel, and
provide operations, logistics and science support that enabled
globally significant Antarctic research to continue. All implemented
protocols to keep their team members safe with many altering their
usual transportation method or route for transiting personnel to/
from Antarctica and up-scaled their medical pre-deployment criteria
(see also IP082).
COMNAP Operations 2020/2021: Highlights and Achievements
Annual General Meeting (AGM) XXXII (2020)
The AGM was scheduled for 3–6 August 2020 in Hobart, Australia,
hosted by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). Due to the
COVID-19 global pandemic, the in-person meetings were cancelled
and the AGM moved to an online platform across the same dates.
This marked the first time in our 32-year history that the AGM was
not held in-person. The online platform proved very successful, 151
people from all 30 Member programs participated.
Plenary business and regional break-out sessions were the main
components. Members, Observers and other operators exchanged
pre‐season 2020/21 information and discussed risk management,
particularly in the context of operations in the global COVID‐19
pandemic. Regional sessions were: Peninsula, Ross Sea, East
Antarctica, Larsemann Hills Management Group, Dronning Maud
Land, and the inaugural High Plateau. Phase II of the COMNAP
project “Efficiency taskforce: Peninsula” was placed on hold due to
the scaled-back nature of the Antarctic summer season.
Symposium
The 19th COMNAP Symposium “Antarctic Station Modernisation:
Future-proofing infrastructure to support research and to reduce
environmental impact” was held via the COMNAP YouTube
Channel from 7 August 2020. Proceedings are published (see
BP010).
Antarctic Aviation Project This project continues (https://
www.comnap.aq/projects/Antarctic-aviation) under a revised
timeframe. The Antarctic Aviation Workshop is cancelled as an in-
person meeting (15–16 July 2021, Toyama, Japan). The intention is
to now focus on key issues related to the ATCM review of
Resolution 1 (2013) (see WP8), minimum survival equipment on
aircraft, and the technology review in advance of an in-person
workshop (see IP059) to be held in late April/early May 2022
(likely combined with the COMNAP SAR Workshop V).
COMNAP Award 2020/21
Awarded by the COMNAP Chair for outstanding contribution to the
goals and principles of COMNAP, the co-recipients are Valery Lukin,
former MNAP of AARI/RAE, and Heinz Miller, former MNAP AWI.
10th COMNAP Antarctic Research Fellowship
COMNAP Antarctic Research Fellow 2020, is Cinthya Elizabeth
Bello Chirinos, (National Agrarian University La Molina, Peru, & the
Division of Antarctic Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Peru) “Surface velocity and facies classification of Znosko glacier,
King George Island, Antarctica, using SAR satellite data time
series”. The fellowship will be used to undertake collaborative
research with the Institute of Oceanography Federal University of
Rio Grande, Brazil. This year, a second Antarctic Research
Fellowship was made possible under an arrangement between
IAATO and COMNAP. The Fellow is Miguel González
Pleiter (University of Alcala, Spain) “Understanding the
consequences of microplastics introduction in the Antarctic
environment: the Plastisphere Resistome”. With support provided
by the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute, Miguel will work as a team
member on the University of the Republic Uruguay’s AntarPLAST
program.
