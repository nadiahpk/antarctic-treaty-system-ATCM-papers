IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: A Historical Review of
Growth, the 2020-21 Season, and Preliminary Estimates for
2021-22
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide the statistical data compiled from Post
Visit Reports for the 2020-21 season.
Due to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, IAATO Operator expeditions
during the 2020-21 season were limited to two individual
expeditions, comprised of three yachts. Three IAATO Operators also
provided dedicated air or vessel support to National Antarctic
Programs.
We also include the preliminary estimates for 2021-22 as of 12
May, 2021. These estimates represent the current best-case
operating scenario for the 2021-22 season. However, operations
will not only depend on Antarctic Gateway protocols but also on
worldwide travel restrictions. We will provide further updates on
the 2021-22 season activities to Competent Authorities in October
2021.
In addition to providing our annual overview of IAATO activities to
the ATCM we also take this opportunity, in IAATO’s 30th year, to
build on discussions with different Treaty Parties around growth
and diversification of activities, by including a historical perspective
which may aid ongoing discussions. Because 2020-2021 was an
irregular season for IAATO, data have been omitted from overall
discussions in this paper.
The figures presented throughout this paper are based on
information provided to IAATO by its Operators. Visitor numbers
reflect only those travelling with IAATO Operator companies and
do not include Observers, Government Officials, or those
individuals taking part in research projects that are being supported
by IAATO Operators.
IAATO’s Membership continues to encompass the majority of
private-sector tour operators. Operator activities are permitted or
authorized through Environmental Impact Assessments, Advance
Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management Permits, and
submitted in advance of the season. Nearly all activities, which
follow IAATO policies and guidelines, have been conducted on
expeditions for more than two decades, and in many cases since the
beginning of Antarctic tourism circa the 1960’s. IAATO Operators
continue to work together to coordinate activities in advance, so
that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally
responsible manner, and that activities are planned to have no more
than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
1.0 Historical Overview
1.1 IAATO Member Activities and Managing for Growth
Prior to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, the growth of the Antarctic
tourism industry was a topic of great interest within the Antarctic
and worldwide communities. In three decades, IAATO has seen two
other periods of growth - once during the mid-1990s and then again
in the period 2003-2008. During each of these periods of growth,
and in the intervening ‘lull’ in activities, IAATO has brought in a
series of tourism management measures, many of which were
subsequently adopted by the ATCM. With advancements in
technology, reporting and communications, and building on lessons
learned in the past, IAATO has been able to forecast and monitor
the current period of growth, making measured decisions and
advancements to properly position the organisation as changes
happen.
While the pandemic effectively cancelled the industry’s activities for
the 2020-2021 season, it is anticipated that when the global
pandemic is eventually brought under control, activity levels will
eventually bounce
back to pre-pandemic levels. Anticipating this eventual return to
normal levels of activity, IAATO continues to strengthen, test, and
refine the suite of ‘tools’ to ensure the continued successful
management of activities.
One of the most recent strengthening of requirements has been a
review of field staff experience. In its early years, IAATO
established the requirement that 75% of field staff would have
previous Antarctic experience. Over the years, the breadth of
activities offered have expanded as has the range of operations,
requiring a broader range of specialized skills for field staff. With
more advanced tools in place, such as the IAATO Online Assessment
and the development worldwide of professional standards in
guiding and other activities, this benchmark has been reviewed to
recognise and reflect this development. As of the 2021-22 season, in
accordance with IAATO Bylaws, Operators are required to hire a
sufficient number of expedition staff, at least 80% of whom have
previous professional guiding experience relevant to their specific
role (e.g. kayak guide, small boat drivers) and 50% of whom have
previous Antarctic experience, as agreed by IAATO definition.
Organizers also are required to ensure that all field staff in their
employ take and pass the relevant IAATO online assessment
module.
Figures 1.1 – 1.3 give an overview of some of the key growth
management tools introduced by IAATO during three periods of
growth between 1993-2021.

1.2 IAATO Member Nationalities
Reflecting on the latest period of growth, the Post Visit Reports
submitted to IAATO indicate the top 10 nationalities who visited
Antarctica has remained relatively consistent over the last ten
seasons, although proportionately, China has seen the greatest
increase in travelers to Antarctica. An overview of the last 10
years can be found in Figure 2: Top 10 Passenger nationalities
travelling with IAATO operators between 2010-2020.

2.0 IAATO Seaborne Operations Overview
This section focuses on IAATO Seaborne Operations.
2.1 IAATO Seaborne Activities
For the last 30 years shipborne tourism on the Peninsula has been
the dominant vector of travel. The vast majority of tourism voyages
(98%) operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-
month austral summer season (from November to March), and
depart from Ushuaia, Argentina or, to a lesser extent, from other
ports north of the Antarctic Treaty Area.
Currently, to the best of our knowledge, all commercial SOLAS
passenger ship Operators conducting tourism activities in the
Antarctic Treaty Area are members of IAATO. Table 1. 10-Year
Statistics of Recorded Seaborne Tourism (including Yachts and
Cruise Only) offers a summary of the last decade of both IAATO
SOLAS and non-SOLAS vessel tourism.

IAATO vessel Operators maintain a minimum of 20:1 field staff to
passenger ratio when ashore. Staff and guides assist in the
preparation of policies and guidelines and ensure that they are
implemented both in the field, and through educational
programmes on board.
2.3 Scope of IAATO Seaborne Activities
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small
inflatable boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B., Naiad,
hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent activity such
as, but not limited to, kayaking, climbing, and short overnight
stays. Most of these activities have taken place for a minimum of 20
years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism
in the 1960’s.
Through the years descriptions and the type of activities have been
expanded in the IAATO Post Visit Reports to facilitate greater
accuracy for reporting and planning. For instance, RPAS Flights,
although banned recreationally in coastal waters by IAATO, has
been expanded to differentiate between commercial, scientific, and
operational/navigation flights. Likewise, what was once described
as swimming, has now been expanded to swimming – distance and
polar plunge.
Representing the current expansion of descriptions during this last
period of growth, Figure 3: Commercial Operated Activities
Conducted from Expedition Vessels and Yachts for 2019-20
illustrates activities offered by IAATO vessels including cruise-only
and yachts, for 2019-2020. Small boat cruising and landing remain
the most popular activities (58%) for vessels offering landings,
while scenic ship cruising for both landing and cruise-only vessels
also remains a key activity. A range of other activities (e.g.
kayaking and short overnight stays) contribute to a smaller portion
(9%) of off-ship activities. Looking ahead it is anticipated that ship
cruising, small boat cruising and small boat landings will continue
to be the dominant activity and other activities will remain small
scale in comparison.
For more information on IAATO Operator activities see ATCM XLII

Expedition Vessels and Yachts for 2019-20
3.0 IAATO Deep Field and Air Tourism Overview
Five IAATO Operators conduct deep field tourism activities and one
air Operator, which also supports air-cruise operations, offers single
day or multi-day Antarctic experiences in the South Shetland
Islands. Table 2. IAATO Deep Field and Air Operators Main Camps
and Main Area of Operation provides an overview of Deep Field and
Air Operators primary areas of operation/base camp. Deep Field
Operators also utilise satellite field camps and runways for their
different activities and flights. Figure 4: Deep Field and Air
Operator Clients 2010-2021 gives an overview of the deep field and
air client numbers for the last decade. Table 3: Programs and
Participant Numbers (clients) for 2015-20 offers additional
information of those operations.

Deep Field and Air Operators usually maintain a higher client to
staff ratio than is typical for seaborne tourism, often one guide to
every three clients. The exception is with solo expeditions, for
example during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are
supported remotely and closely monitored through communication
protocols. All Deep Field and Air Operators prepare contingency
plans for the health, safety, medical care and evacuation or their
staff and clients, in line with ATCM Resolution 6(2017).
3.1 Deep Field Operator Programs and Activities
Activities including the operation of standard programs, the
organization and operation of private expeditions, and logistical
support of other expeditions for the last five seasons, are outlined in
Table 3: Programs and Participant Numbers (clients) for 2015-20.
Total numbers participating include clients from all five IAATO
Deep Field Operators. Note that some clients participated in
multiple programs. Most activities detailed below have been offered
consistently since the 1990’s and have not changed in this latest
period of growth. Additionally, activities for air Operator Aerovias
DAP are listed for seasons 2018 – 2020, reporting on their activities
since becoming an IAATO Member.

4.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2020-21
Season
The 2020-21 season of Antarctic tourism was effectively cancelled
as a result of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. How and when the
industry will recover is yet to be seen, but the pandemic will
continue to affect IAATO Operator activities for the 2021-22 season
and possibly beyond. The preliminary estimates in Appendix 2
represent the current best-case operating scenario for the 2021-22
season should the majority of travel restrictions be removed.
Operations will depend on both Antarctic Gateway protocols and
worldwide travel restrictions and/or protocols. We will provide
further updates on the 2021-22 season activities to Competent
Authorities in October 2021.
5.0 Tourism Statistics
The following data is publicly available on the IAATO website
