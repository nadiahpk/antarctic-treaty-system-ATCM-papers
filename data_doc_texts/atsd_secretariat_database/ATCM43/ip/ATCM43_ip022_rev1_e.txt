Information Paper submitted by SCAR
Summary
Loss of suitable breeding habitat is the most important challenge
that emperor penguins face. Whilst global endeavours seek to fight
human-induced climate change arising from increasing greenhouse
gas emissions, it would be precautionary to reduce or eliminate
other stressors that could otherwise add to the burden that emperor
penguins face. Consequently, it is important to develop
management options that are informed by the best available
scientific evidence. Listing emperor penguins as a Specially
Protected Species would enhance management options.
Background
The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the largest extant
penguin species. Measured from the tip of the beak to the end of
their tail, adults measure 110 to 120 cm and body mass varies
seasonally, ranging from about 23 to 45 kg. Males tend to be
slightly larger than females. As with many seabirds, emperor
penguins are long-lived; their age of first breeding is usually 5 or 6
years although some birds attempt to breed at age 3 years
(Jenouvrier et al., 2005). Emperor penguins have a circumpolar
distribution and the vast majority of colonies are located on the
land-fast sea ice (Fretwell & Trathan, 2020).
Emperor penguins are the only vertebrates that breed in Antarctica
during the winter. Breeding commences in March/April when the
adults return to their coastal breeding grounds, and all colonies so
far studied have a similar annual schedule (see review by Trathan et
al., 2020). Courtship takes about 6 weeks (Ancel et al., 2013), and
laying starts in May and continues into June. Females produce only
one egg in a season. The eggs are incubated on the feet of the males
while the females leave the colonies to forage, and after about 65
days, the eggs hatch. Females start to return in mid-July and take
over the care of the egg or the freshly hatched chick. Males go to
sea to forage and build up body reserves after a fast that lasts nearly
4 months. Chicks are unable to adequately regulate their own body
temperature, and so are dependent upon their parents for warmth
for about 50 days. Once the chicks are able to withstand the
prevailing environmental conditions, their development and growth
requires both parents to hunt and supply food. Chicks fledge in
December/January, and the adults that have bred go to sea to build
up resources prior to the annual moult that lasts for about one
month. Thus, emperor penguins require stable fast ice for at least 9
months to rear their chicks successfully (Jouventin, 1971).
The diet of emperor penguins is diverse, and its composition varies
between years, and with colony, season, and foraging location. For
example, at the Drescher Inlet (72°52’S, 19°25’W), the summer diet
of emperor penguins was dominated by squid species Allurotheuthis
antarcticus, Moroteuthopsis longimana and Psychroteuthis glacialis
(~93%) followed by fish, krill, amphipods and isopods (Piatowski &
Pütz, 1994). Some years later at the same colony, the penguins’
summer diet was largely Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (~75%);
the remaining diet was fish (~17%), as well as some amphipods
and small numbers of various squid species (Pütz, 1995). In
contrast, emperor penguins at Amanda Bay (69°17’S, 76°46’E)
mainly consumed Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum
(~78%), some squid species and amphipods, but hardly any
euphausiids (Gales et al., 1990). Most prey species of emperor
penguins are pelagic, but demersal and benthopelagic species are
also consumed (Kirkwood & Robertson, 1997; Wienecke &
Robertson, 1997). Emperor penguins also forage at the under-
surface of the sea ice (e.g. for the bald rockcod Pagothenia
borchgrevinki (Ponganis et al., 2000)).
Emperor penguins are formidable divers, foraging mostly at depths
of 50 to 250 m (Wienecke & Robertson, 1997; Zimmer et al., 2010).
Occasionally, emperor penguins dive deeper and can reach depths
in excess of 500 m. For example, in Wienecke et al. (2007), of
nearly 130,000 dives only 264 (or 0.2%) were deeper than 400 m,
and only one of 93 birds dived to > 500 m (Wienecke et al., 2007).
Generally, dives last 3 to 6 min, thus remaining within their aerobic
dive limit (Kooyman & Kooyman, 1995). However, extremely long
dive durations can occur when emperor penguins are diving under
fast ice or get trapped under pack ice; dives exceeding 20 and even
30 min are exceedingly rare (Goetz et al., 2018; Wienecke et al.,
2007).
Emperor penguins are very well adapted for life in the ice in terms
of their behaviour, morphology and physiology (Kooyman et al.,
1971; McCafferty et al., 2013). Their highly social, non-territorial
character enables them to huddle and share body warmth, an
effective strategy to reduce energy expenditure. When resting or
incubating, the plantar surfaces of the feet are lifted off the ice and
the toes are tucked into the belly feathers. Body fat reserves (up to
30% of the body mass), and a reduction in the basal metabolic rate
also limit energy expenditure. Furthermore, their extremities are
very small in relation to their round bodies and give a low surface
to volume ratio. The feathers are greatly reduced in size, overlap
extensively, and are very dense (Williams et al., 2015). The
plumage can reach nearly ambient temperatures at the outside but
accounts for about 85% of the resistance to heat transfer from the
body. Counter-current heat exchange warms the venous blood and
cools the arterial blood in the nasal passages, the flippers and legs.
All these adaptations keep the core temperature around 38°C
(McCafferty et al., 2013).
The most recent global survey of emperor penguins by VHR satellite
imagery, revealed that the population comprised ~238,000
breeding pairs, or ~595,00 birds (Fretwell et al., 2012), calculated
across 46 colonies. Notably, of those 46 colonies seven were
discovered or confirmed by VHR. Since 2009, more apparent
breeding locations have been discovered, also by satellite, bringing
the total to 61 colonies with probably ~250,000 breeding pairs
(Fretwell & Trathan, 2020). Interestingly, emperor penguin colonies
are evenly distributed around the Antarctic continent along the fast
ice (mean separation distance ~220 km ± 17 km), which suggests
interspecific competition for resources (Santora et al., 2020).
Although many colonies are predictable in locations (Robertson et
al., 2014), VHR image analysis has also indicated that entire
colonies can appear or disappear from year to year, suggesting
movement among colony locations (see below; LaRue et al., 2015,
Jenouvrier et al., 2017), and colonies may relocate on nearby
glaciers or ice shelves in years of poor sea ice conditions (Fretwell
et al., 2014) or particular wind conditions (Zitterbart et al., 2014).
Prior to the emperor penguin “satellite era” of research (e.g., since
about 2009), only ~30 colonies of emperor penguins were known
to exist (Wienecke, 2010), as research on the status and distribution
of the species was largely conducted in relative proximity to
research stations, and on colonies accessible by foot or by air.
Remote access by VHR has allowed unprecedented views of the
coastline and enhanced data collection about the status,
distribution, and insights into behaviour that now allows for
population monitoring.
Work to improve population estimates is important for refining
population trend analyses at the global and regional scales. A key
requirement is to improve satellite ground validation (see draft
Action Plan). Colonies are known to spread and contract, depending
upon prevailing weather conditions (Richter et al., 2018). Thus,
work to better characterise population estimates should include
campaigns to enhance satellite image acquisition for selected
colonies where ground counts are feasible. Movement between
colonies appears to occur (LaRue et al., 2015; Cristofari et al.,
2016), whilst individual colony population counts within a region
are known to rise and fall in differing ways (Kooyman & Ponganis
2017). Improved understanding of linkages is therefore key (see
draft Action Plan, Annex A).
In addition to large-scale population estimates using VHR satellite
imagery, it is important to support long-term longitudinal
monitoring to understand the mechanisms by which climate
variability affects population dynamics. At present, individual life
histories of emperor penguins are only monitored on an annual
basis at Taylor Glacier (since 1988) and Pointe Géologie, the
longest continuously observed of all emperor colonies, and
monitored since its discovery in 1952. Only a few other long-term
time series of colony size exist at other sites, but are critically
needed (see draft Action Plan, Annex A) for comparative studies to
better understand and project the regional and global population
responses to future climate change.
Key findings
For the purposes of considering the emperor penguin as an
Antarctic Specially Protected Species, SCAR identifies climate
change to be the single most important threat, coupled with
projected changing climatic
conditions over the coming century (Ainley et al., 2010; Jenouvrier
et al., 2009; 2012; 2014; 2017; 2020; Trathan et al., 2011; 2020;
Fretwell & Trathan 2019; 2020). Measurement (and modelling) of
fast ice remains challenging at the circumpolar scale (e.g. Massom
et al., 2009; Fraser et al 2021) and trends in coastal fast ice may be
independent of what might be happening with sea ice extent; for
example, altered winds may lead to more extensive large-scale sea
ice, but possibly reduced fast ice (Ainley et al., 2010). However, sea
ice extent is a convenient correlation, or proxy for other, more-
difficult-to-quantify factors that have a bearing on emperor
penguins, and in the long-term, sea ice at the large-scale probably
determines the ultimate condition of fast ice as a breeding platform.
Changes to or loss of fast ice, or early ice break-out can cause
massive breeding failure and even adult mortality in emperor
penguins (Barbraud & Weimerskirch, 2001; Jenouvrier et al., 2009).
Also, unusually extensive fast ice cover in the vicinity of a colony
during the rearing period can also lead to reduced breeding success,
as breeding adults are forced to cover long distances on fast ice to
reach foraging grounds. Increased energetic expenditures of adults
decreases chick feeding frequencies and growth, and ultimately
increases chick mortality at the colony (Massom et al., 2009;
Barbraud et al., 2015) with important consequences for emperor
penguin population recovery (Jenouvrier et al., 2009). The
importance and medium-term impact of occasional massive
perturbations are only now becoming apparent (Kooyman &
Ponganis, 2017; Fretwell & Trathan, 2019).
In addition to buffering and protecting fast ice, seasonal sea ice
(pack ice) is important in other ways for emperor penguins, as they
spend much of their time foraging within the pack ice or in
polynyas, both during the breeding season (Kirkwood & Robertson,
1997; Wienecke & Robertson, 1997; Labrousse et al., 2019), and
post breeding (Rodary et al., 2000; Kooyman et al., 2004; Goetz et
al., 2018). The diet of emperor penguins comprises species that are
tied to sea ice habitats (see review by Trathan et al., 2020), at least
during important parts of their life cycle. Emperor penguins are
subject to locally- and regionally-contrasted sea ice trends due to
climate change and variability (Parkinson & Cavalieri, 2012;
Meredith et al., 2019). Since the start of regular satellite monitoring
in 1979, Antarctic sea ice cover has shown regional variation as
well as considerable inter-annual variability (Parkinson, 2019).
Given the complexity of the main drivers of Antarctic sea ice,
greater understanding about the threats associated with sea ice
changes are important, given the reliance of emperor penguins on
their specialized breeding habitat and ultimately the species’
persistence. Increases in Antarctic sea ice extent were observed
during almost three decades until 2016 when the circumpolar
Antarctic sea ice extent dramatically decreased (Fig 1a in Meehl et
al., 2019). The reduced sea ice extent was maintained through 2017
when it reached its record minimum. Different atmospheric and
oceanic factors were responsible for these changes highlighting the
complexity of the processes driving emperor penguin habitat. The
cooling of the near-surface subpolar waters over 25 years (−0.07 
± 0.04 °C per decade; Auger et al., 2021) is likely associated in part
with the melting of the ice sheets. This cooling of subpolar waters is
also accompanied by a freshening of the surface waters over the
same period, which is one of the drivers for the increase in sea-ice
cover until 2016 (e.g. Morrow and Kestenare, 2017). The unusual
decrease of sea ice cover in 2016 has been explained by multiple
factors such as record sea surface temperature, precipitation, and
convective heating anomalies in the eastern tropical Indian and far-
western Pacific oceans. Both the warmer ocean temperatures and
the direct effects of surface wind forcing on the sea ice produced
the rapid and sustained decrease of the Antarctic sea ice extent
(Meehl et al., 2019).
Assessment of changes in sea ice as a major threat to emperor
penguins is supported by modelled colony population forecasts,
which are now available over the entire species range (Jenouvrier
et al., 2014; 2020). Consequently, legal recognition of future
climate change impacts on the species are now urgent (Trathan et
al., 2020), given continued increases in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Ganesan et al., 2019; Nisbet
et al., 2019). Schwalm et al. (2020a; 2020b) highlight that these are
equivalent to CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project)
scenario RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) or to
a projected mean global temperature increase of 3.7°C (range 2.6°
to 4.8°) by the late-21st century.
Multiple anthropogenic forcing factors (ozone and GHG) and the
complicated processes involving the ocean, atmosphere, and
adjacent ice sheets, are leading to large uncertainties in projections
of Antarctic sea ice (Meredith et al., 2019). Regional trends of
Antarctic sea ice during the historical period are not captured by
models, especially the decrease in the Bellingshausen Sea and the
expansion in the Ross Sea (Hobbs et al., 2016). Moreover, model
responses are widely divergent in the Weddell Sea (Hobbs et al.,
2016; Ivanova et al., 2016), a region with complex ocean-sea ice
interactions that several models were unable to replicate (de
Lavergne et al., 2014). Although there is large uncertainty in the
magnitude of future sea ice decline, a loss of Antarctic sea ice in the
future is almost certain given increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations and rising global temperatures. Importantly, the
range of Antarctic sea ice conditions relevant for the emperor
penguin
simulated by the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and used
in the most recent penguin population forecasts, overlaps very well
with the range of observations over the historical period. The only
exceptions are in a few regions and seasons of the penguin life cycle
for which the sensitivity of the population growth rate to sea ice
conditions is small (see Figures 1 and 2 in Jenouvrier et al., 2020).
Emperor penguins are vulnerable to different kinds of sea ice
perturbation. The most obvious is the early loss (break-out) of the
fast ice in spring on which a colony is located. Other perturbations
include late formation of sea ice in the autumn, that can delay the
onset of breeding or prevent breeding attempts altogether, or
trigger the relocation of colonies onto icebergs or ice shelves.
Relocations often result in a longer commute to the fast ice edge
(often several more kilometres each way) and may have
consequences for breeding productivity. It is not yet possible to
estimate the frequency of this sort of event, but for some colonies in
marginal locations (such as at Ledda Bay), ice failure is a regular
event, and based on observations from the satellite record, has
happened in multiple years. Approximately 9 out of ~61 colonies
are known to ‘blink’ (disappearing some years, reappearing in
others) within the 13 years of the satellite record (LaRue et al.,
unpublished). In addition, when ice shelves calve, very large,
tabular icebergs may also disrupt breeding success due to the
increased distance to feeding areas resulting from blocked
pathways, as seen in the Ross Sea in 2001 leading to mortality of
both chicks and adults and low breeding performance for several
consecutive years (2001- 2004, Kooyman et al., 2007).
The consequences of ‘blinking’, and of massive perturbation events
for emperor penguin colonies are only now being evaluated, but
highlight the challenges associated with modelling future
population states. Levels of uncertainty remain high, but could be
reduced through precautionary action, coupled with an improved
understanding of life history parameters (see draft Action Plan). To
estimate the frequency of such extreme events, the number of
colonies with true absences can be estimated using satellite
imagery. It is important to note that such estimates of extreme
perturbation may be conservative; massive breeding failures have
already occurred (e.g. in 2013 at Pointe Géologie, Barbraud et al.,
2015; Cape Crozier in 2018, Schmidt and Ballard, 2020), but some
have only been detected from satellite imagery. Consequently, a
true absence of a colony likely reflects a major perturbation. Based
on the number of true absences over the last 10 years for all
colonies, researchers estimated a frequency of 3.6% (LaRue et al.,
unpublished).
Whilst aspects of the natural history of emperor penguins remain
data deficient, particularly at sea, further work to explore life
history characteristics and geographic distribution will be
important. Focused work on their spatial overlap with human
activities (see draft Action Plan) may reveal additional threats as
more knowledge is accumulated. However, based on existing data,
emperor penguin populations are thought to experience little direct
interaction with human activities, apart from those associated with
research, tourism and their sea ice obligate life history. Activities
associated with tourism and scientific research are regulated
through national permitting authorities, as is the collection of eggs
or adults for zoos which is generally rare (Trathan et al., 2020).
Other important threats at local scales are also regulated and
require international oversight through comprehensive
environmental evaluations under the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS)
to ensure that wildlife breeding sites remain unaffected by
developments of future infrastructure, such as new aircraft runways.
Threats at sea, such as fisheries by-catch (e.g. Crawford et al., 2017)
and fisheries resource competition, are currently virtually non-
existent as the regional commercial fishery for Antarctic krill
(Euphausia superba) is highly localised and operates far from
emperor breeding sites. Currently, there is no commercial harvest of
Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica; e.g. Trathan et al.,
2020). However, increasing global demands for marine resources
are likely to lead to the expansion of commercial fisheries in the
Southern Ocean (e.g. Liu & Brooks, 2018). Changes in extent and
duration of sea ice are likely to enable fisheries to move farther
south than in the past, and hence, operate closer to emperor
penguin colonies.
Threats to non-breeding animals are poorly understood at the
moment, but as juveniles and non-breeding birds often range far
from the continent (Kooyman et al., 1996; Barber-Meyer et al.,
2008; Wienecke et al., 2010; Thiebot et al., 2013; Goetz et al.,
2018; Labrousse et al., 2019), birds could be subjected to yet
undocumented threats. As emperor penguins are not dietary
specialists, possible threats to be explored in greater detail include
their susceptibility to plastics and other pollutants, pathogens that
may jump species in a warming ocean, interactions with fisheries
particularly if preferred fishing locations also change with climate
change, and changes in prey distribution/availability associated
with changes in ocean properties and structures.
In recognition of these threats, the emperor penguin has been listed
by the IUCN as Near Threatened under Red List criterion A3, sub-
criterion c [ IUCN (2019) Red List criteria are used to evaluate
whether a species belongs in a threatened category (Critically
Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable). For emperor penguins,
criterion A3 is used (A3: population size reduction measured over 3
generations, either projected, inferred or suspected to be met, up to
a maximum of 100 years into the future. Sub-criterion c is then
relevant (c: population reduction based upon a decline in the area
of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or habitat quality). The cut
point between Vulnerable and Near Threatened is 30% population
reduction over 3 generations.]; however, the species is projected to
undergo a rapid population decrease as Antarctic sea ice begins to
change (thinning, reducing in extent, etc.) within the next few
decades. Under current levels of CO2 emission (business-as-usual
GHG emissions), 80% of colonies are projected to be quasi-extinct
by 2100, whilst the total abundance of emperor penguins is
projected to decline by at least 81% relative to its current size
(Jenouvrier et al., 2020), although major changes in sea ice
prevalence are projected to begin only in mid-century (e.g.
Bronselaer et al., 2018). Including extreme perturbations in models
increases the rate of population decline, such that up to 100% of
colonies are projected to be quasi-extinct by 2100, and the total
abundance of emperor penguins is projected to decline by at least
99% relative to its current size (Jenouvrier et al., 2021). The extent
to which climate change is controlled by international efforts will
determine whether a smaller proportion of the existing population
is lost (Jenouvrier et al., 2020). Despite uncertainties over future
climate change, in the best-case (so far unlikely) lowest emissions
scenario, the population is likely to decrease by 31% (37% when
including extreme events) by the end of this century as a result of
existing and ongoing change.
Within the next three generations (generation length ~16 years;
Jenouvrier et al., 2014), the population is estimated to decline by
~27 to 89% under current emission scenarios by 2070, depending
upon the demographic and climate scenario. For RCP8.5: between
58% (no extreme events) to 89% (extreme events related to sea ice
that affects reproduction and survival) decrease in population are
projected by 2070 (Jenouvrier et al., 2021). Thus, under Red List
criteria, emperor penguins are now close to being classified as
Vulnerable but given that uncertainties remain about future GHG
emission scenarios, and because the assessment also depends upon a
degree of model verification against population trend, the species
remains listed as Near Threatened. Nevertheless, the rapid rate of
population decrease, particularly from mid-century onwards, means
the species will quickly become Vulnerable, or even Endangered, if
important threats (loss of sea ice habitat, alteration in food
availability, major changes to the currents in the Southern Ocean,
extreme storm events) continue unabated. Model projections by
Jenouvrier et al. (2020; 2021) integrated important uncertainties
(in a way that is rarely achieved in ecology); their results are
probabilistic. In choosing a period for climate-scenario or
population-response projections, it is important not to confuse the
uncertainty in rate or magnitude of change with uncertainty in
directionality (McClure et al., 2013). Although the precision of
estimates of global temperature increase is low, an increase in mean
global temperature increase is virtually certain. Similarly, although
there is large uncertainty in the magnitude of future sea ice decline,
a loss of Antarctic sea ice in the future is almost certain given
increasing GHG concentrations and rising global temperatures.
Therefore, when the direction of change is clear, projections of
species status under climate change should not be discounted solely
because the magnitude of projected change at a particular time is
highly variable.
Figure 1. The total number of breeding pairs of emperor penguins
between 2009 and 2100 projected for various climate scenarios
(panels) for various demographic scenarios of extreme events
(coloured lines). These global population sizes are calculated using
sea ice concentration anomaly projections from the Community
Climate System Model using RCP8.5, an optimistic scenario that
meets the emissions pledges and targets pathway that includes
governments’ Nationally Determined Contributions, Paris
Agreement's 2°C goal. The thick lines are the median combining
population trajectories from demographic scenarios and the
coloured areas are the 90% envelopes from stochastic simulations of
all population trajectories under a given climate scenario. The four
demographic extreme events scenarios are (1) Extreme events with
the historical observed frequency that will produce a massive
breeding failure at a colony a given year; (2) Extreme events with
the historical observed frequency that will reduce adult survival by
10% and produce a massive breeding failure at a colony a given
year; (3) Extreme events that will increase in frequency in the
future proportionally to the loss of sea ice and produce a massive
breeding failure at a colony a given year; (4) Extreme events that
will increase in frequency in the future proportionally to the loss of
sea ice and will reduce adult survival by 10% and produce a
massive breeding failure at a colony in a given year.

1.5°C. Dots show the location of colonies (see Figure S1; Table S1 of
Jenouvrier et al. 2020). Dot colours show the conservation status.
Following Jenouvrier et al. (2014, 2020), ‘vulnerable’ (green) is a
likely population decline by more than 30%; ‘endangered’ (yellow)
is a likely population decline by more than 50%; ‘quasi-extinct’
(red) is a likely population decline by more than 90%. Blue colour
refers to populations that are not likely to decline by more than
30%. A likely outcome is defined by IPCC as a probability >66%.

Conclusions
Based on the evidence from the scientific literature, SCAR
recommends that precautionary action is warranted because sea ice
projections, which depend upon the climate scenario of projected
socioeconomic global changes up to 2100, suggest that even if we
stopped emitting all GHG today, global warming and climate
change will continue to affect sea ice for decades to come. Taking a
longer perspective is therefore important for considering climate
change threats. According to Ridley & Hewitt (2014), it takes sea
ice longer to recover if CO2 levels decline, and the reversibility of
sea ice loss is less and slower in Antarctica than in the Arctic.
Specifically, they showed that sea ice minimum extent lags peak
CO2 by ~20 years followed by a 30 year pause in sea ice decline,
while atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are returned to
preindustrial levels. In addition, the loss of the Antarctic sea ice
area is irreversible with a substantial loss of sea ice, which would
not recover after a further 150 years at preindustrial CO2.
Since emperor penguins are a long-lived species with a generation
time of ~16 years, it is especially important to use long assessment
periods, as this and other life history traits buffer climate
variability. Even as sea ice conditions deteriorate and reduce
breeding success, adult penguins are likely to continue to survive,
unless adults suffer mortality in extreme events. However, at some
point the lack of recruitment will potentially lead to a rapid
decrease of the population. For species with delayed reproductive
maturity, population growth will reflect conditions further in the
past than short-lived species that mature rapidly, and present
population growth can mask current deteriorating conditions for
reproduction or recruitment (McClure et al., 2013). Protection of all
genetically distinct meta-populations might be important for future
resilience to environmental change; certainly, protection of the
climate change refugial meta-populations is likely to be vital
(Younger et al., 2015; 2017; Cristofari et al., 2016).

Annex A: Development of a draft Species Action Plan for the
Emperor Penguin
Unambiguously, the largest threat to emperor penguins is the loss of
Antarctic sea ice as result of global climate change. Mitigation of
this threat will require coordinated and unified global action that is
beyond the remit of this draft Action Plan. Nonetheless, there are
several actions that can be taken to offset and reduce the effects of
climate change. This draft Plan aims to manage all direct and
indirect potentially harmful human interactions with free-living
emperor penguins to reduce threats at every stage of their life cycle,
and thereby ensure their continued existence in the wild until such
time that risks posed by climate change are mitigated.
Specific Objectives
Establish within SCAR’s EG-BAMM an Emperor Penguin Working
Group focused on the delivery of this draft Action Plan through
liaison with all interested and affected parties, facilitating the
provision of regular synthetic updates on the status of emperor
penguins.
Engage across the international science community to develop best
practice guidelines for specific scientific procedures relevant to
emperor penguins (e.g., Code of Conduct on using Antarctic
Animals for Scientific Research, adopted by CEP in 2019). It is
critical that all research is conducted ethically and we aim to seek
collaborative opportunities to science facilities close to emperor
penguin colonies, to increase awareness about the risks and threats
to the species and to promote such ethical guidelines. Engage with
Treaty Parties and their national Competent Authorities and with
the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs to provide
advice and recommendations and where appropriate facilitate
distribution of new guidelines, including translations thereof to the
predominant language used at a given facility.
The Working Group will also convey the outcomes of relevant
scientific assessments, with advice and recommendations to
facilitate development of management actions to the ATCPs on a
regular basis, or as any substantial changes might suggest, via
Working Papers submitted either via the CEP or directly by SCAR in
keeping with Article 10.2 of the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
As part of the five-yearly update of this draft Action Plan, provide
information, advice and recommendations on the effectiveness of
the management actions for emperor penguins and provide
suggestions or recommendations for changes to management
actions if these are required. Doing so should involve best practice
decision-science and engage all stakeholders for maximum efficacy,
and should be preceded in the year prior to the update by an online
forum or meeting to assess the effectiveness of actions.
Continue and expand demographic studies to improve
documentation of the functional relationships between demographic
parameters across different life history stages and environmental
fluctuations.
Build on analyses by Ainley et al. (2010), Jenouvrier et al. (2014;
2017; 2019, 2021) and Abadi et al. (2017) to develop new analyses
of how emperor penguins are projected to respond to climate
change using CMIP5 data, and when sufficiently mature, CMIP6
data. Consider the full circumpolar extent of emperor penguins with
a special focus on inter-annual variation in breeding propensity (i.e.
frequency of occurrence of breeding at colony sites) across different
parts of the species range. Highlight the need for regional climate
models that provide robust ecological projection capability at scales
relevant to the ecology of emperor penguins. Develop modelling
capacity to provide projections beyond the next 100 years.
Undertake population assessment studies to monitor emperor
penguins at the colony scale, the regional scale and the circumpolar
scale. Liaise with and coordinate with interested parties to initiate
ground counts and aerial counts to ground-truth and improve
satellite remote-sensing population estimates. Evaluate population
assessments based on satellite remote-sensing, with particular
emphasis on short-term colony movement (see e.g. Richter et al.,
2018), repeated observation within the same breeding season, and
improved image analysis techniques.
Collate all available tracking data to undertake a gap analysis.
Then, if deemed necessary, undertake new telemetry studies to
better document the preferred habitats of emperor penguins at
different times of the year and across different life history stages.
Better understanding of the energetic, physiological constraints and
behavioural capacity of emperor penguins to adapt to new breeding
conditions and altered food web interactions, including altered prey
availability and changed predation risks.
Identify and collate information on other potential threats to
emperor penguins, especially those associated with human
activities, such as fishing, plastic pollution, other pollutants, habitat
degradation of the oceans, pathogens, etc. Quantify all such threats,
both spatially and temporally, to determine where and how
management actions can mitigate the impacts of these threats and
improve the survival of emperor penguin breeding populations.
Continue liaison with the Antarctic community, including Treaty
Parties, their national competent authorities and International
Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) as required, to
provide expert advice on responsible visitor management at
emperor penguin colonies. Promote exchange of information across
the Antarctic community to raise awareness about responsible
visitation, conservation and reducing and offsetting global
emissions. Identify collaborative opportunities to communicate this
information and Antarctic Treaty System efforts to the wider public.
Assess feasibility for research and monitoring using ‘ships of
opportunity ’and other operators.
Liaise with relevant Associations of Zoos and Aquaria about living
collections and breeding programmes, including the identification
of wild-caught specimens of emperor penguins. Link with such
bodies to increase public awareness and need for conservation.
Assess and revise this draft Action Plan every five years.
