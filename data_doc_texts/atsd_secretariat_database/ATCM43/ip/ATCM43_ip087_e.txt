Polish-Russian Collaboration in East Antarctica
Polish-Russian Collaboration in East Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by Poland and Russia
Summary
In a framework of the agreement on research cooperation, Polish
experts are going to join theÂ 67th Russian Antarctic Expedition
(RAE) in the upcoming summer Antarctic season 2021/2022 for
collaborative research in the Bunger Hills of East Antarctica.
A group of Polish scientists and technicians will inspect the
condition of the infrastructure at the Dobrowolski Polish Antarctic
Station (Bunger Hills, East Antarctica), after 40 years of non-use.
The Station was handed over to Poland by the USSR in 1958, and
the last Polish expedition took place in 1978/79.
Polish and Russian researchers will carry out geological and
geomorphological field work in the Bunger Hills area. The
expedition will also investigate the possibility of installation of
autonomic and automatic seismological and/or geomagnetic
instruments to monitor geophysical fields for scientific purposes
(see ATCM40_bp005-e). After the eventual installation and
operation of instruments, data obtained will be made available to
the international research community. An initial environmental
evaluation will also be prepared.
