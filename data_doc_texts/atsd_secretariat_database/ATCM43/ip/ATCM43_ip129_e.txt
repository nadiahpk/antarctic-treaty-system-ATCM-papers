New Ferraz Station book and stamp
On 15 January 2020, the opening ceremony of the new Brazilian
station was held with the presence of the Vice-President of Brazil
and the Science and Technology Minister, among other guests.
The new station was built on the site of the previous facility, which
was established in 1984 and mostly destroyed at a fire in 2012
caused by a fuel leak. Scientific research continued in temporary
facilities on Keller Peninsula, as well as on board the Brazilian Navy
vessels NApOc Ary Rongel and NPo Almirante Maximiano.

The opening of the new station was a milestone, celebrated with the
publication of the book "Comandante Ferraz Station - Brazil's House
in Antarctica", a collection of interesting stories about the station’s
history,
crew and the supportive community that surrounds them. All
proceeds from the book’s sales will be given to the station’s new
Offshore Rescue Craft (ORC).
Ferraz´s book, translated into English and Chinese, shows the story
of the construction through photographs. The book is available in
PDF format on the PROANTAR website at: https://
