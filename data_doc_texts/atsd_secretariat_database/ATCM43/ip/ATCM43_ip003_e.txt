Consultative Meeting
Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the Forty Third
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
CCAMLR-38 (October 2019)
1. The 38th Annual Meeting of CCAMLR (CCAMLR-38) was held in
Hobart, Australia, from 21 October to 1 November 2019 and was
chaired by Mr Fernando Curcio Ruigómez (Spain).
2. The Report of the Meeting is in the public domain (https://
www.ccamlr.org/en/ccamlr-38).
3. Australia, as the Depositary State, reported that the Netherlands
became a Member of the Commission on 8 October 2019. The
Commission welcomed the Netherlands to its first meeting as a
Member.
Implementation and compliance
4. The Commission endorsed a new non-Contracting Party (NCP)
Engagement Strategy and Action Plan for 2020–2022 and agreed to
extend the compliance evaluation process to Acceding States as a
trial for 2020.
5. The Commission noted that the number of illegal, unreported and
unregulated (IUU) vessel sightings in the Convention Area had
shown a steady decline over time with the last reported sighting in
2016. No additional vessels were added to the CCAMLR IUU lists.
Administration and Finance
6. The Commission agreed to changes in the formula used to
calculate the fees that accompany notifications to fish for krill,
toothfish and other species in the Convention Area, including
notifications to undertake research fishing.
Management of marine resources
7. The Commission noted that up to 13 September 2019 the total
catch of krill reported for the 2018/19 fishing season was 381 922
tonnes. Five Members and 11 vessels fished.
8. The Commission noted that a multi-Member synoptic krill survey
undertaken in the austral summer of 2018/19 assessed the biomass
of krill in Area 48 to be 62.6 million tonnes. (Note for ATCM: This
is similar to the biomass estimated by the last synoptic survey
undertaken in 2000.)
9. The Commission noted the progress of the Scientific Committee
to develop a new management strategy for krill, and emphasised
the importance of providing advice on the new strategy by 2021.
The strategy will be based on the following key priority elements:
(i) a stock assessment to estimate precautionary harvest rates
(ii) regular updates of biomass estimates, initially at the subarea
scale, but potentially at multiple scales
(iii) a risk assessment framework to inform the spatial allocation of
catch.
10. In 2018/19, 13 Members fished for Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) and/or Antarctic toothfish (D. mawsoni).
Members also conducted research fishing for toothfish in closed
areas. The reported
total catch in the Convention Area of D. eleginoides to 13
September 2019 was 8 340 tonnes and that of D. mawsoni was
4 097 tonnes.
11. The Commission agreed catch limits for toothfish and icefish.
However, it was unable to reach consensus on research proposals in
Division 58.4.1, which therefore remains closed.
12. The Commission noted that the 103 seabirds estimated killed in
the 2018/19 season was the third-lowest mortality figure on record.
Spatial management
13. The Commission agreed to give its prior approval to the draft
management plans for new Antarctic Specially Protected Areas
(ASPA) at the Rosenthal Islands and at Inexpressible Island. ATCM
should note this approval which has also been transmitted to the
CEP.
14. The Commission noted that in May 2019, the UK notified all
Members that the area of the Pine Island Glacier had reduced by
15.1% since 2017, thus meeting the criteria for designation of a
Special Area for Scientific Study. The Pine Island Glacier area
became a Stage 1 designation on 1 June 2019. Under Conservation
Measure (CM) 24-04, paragraph 24, the attention of ATCM is drawn
to the details of the Stage 1 designation, and ATCM is encouraged
to consider whether to take any appropriate steps to complement
and facilitate scientific study within the area.
15. The South Orkney Islands southern shelf marine protected area
(MPA) was adopted by CCAMLR in 2009 (CM 91-03). In line with
the requirement of CM 91-03, the EU and its member States
presented the second 5-yearly review of the MPA. There was no
consensus in the Commission to endorse the review. CM 91-03 will
remain in its current form until the next review due in 2024.
16. The Commission also discussed the Ross Sea region MPA
research and monitoring plan, and proposals for an East Antarctica
MPA, a Weddell Sea MPA and an Antarctic Peninsula Region MPA.
There was no consensus on these items.
Climate change
17. The Commission noted the importance of climate change
considerations in its procedures and discussed a range of
suggestions for an increased inclusion of its implications in its
management approaches.
Implementation of Convention objectives
18. The Commission welcomed the Prague Declaration made by the
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties on 8 July 2019.
19. The Commission agreed to establish a General Capacity Building
Fund (GCBF) to support specific projects, activities or travel
support, or to address special needs of Members if the Commission
so decides, aimed at enhancing Members’ capacity to better achieve
the objective of the CAMLR Convention. Applications to the fund
are open to all Members, and to Acceding States or NCPs
cooperating with the CDS where an application has the support of a
Member.
CCAMLR-39 (October 2020)
1. The 39th Annual Meeting of CCAMLR (CCAMLR-39) was held
online from 27 to 30 October 2020 and was chaired by Mr
Fernando Curcio Ruigómez (Spain).
2. The Report of the Meeting is in the public domain
(www.ccamlr.org/node/107598).
3. The Standing Committee on Implementation and Compliance
(SCIC) and the Standing Committee on Administration and Finance
(SCAF) had informal virtual meetings and did not adopt a report,
however, the Chair (SCIC) and Acting Chair (SCAF) presented
summaries of the e-group discussions to the Commission for
consideration.
4. Australia, as the Depositary State, reported that on 7 May 2020,
the People’s Republic of China (PRC) made a declaration that in
accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the PRC, the Government of the PRC
decides that the Convention will apply to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the PRC from 1 July 2020.
5. The Commission remembered Professor Denzil Miller who died
on 30 November 2019, and who played a central role in CCAMLR
and Antarctic affairs for over forty years.
Implementation and compliance
6. The Commission added the vessel Nika to the Contracting Party
IUU list. Panama subsequently informed the Commission that the
Nika had been removed from the Panamanian shipping vessel
register.
7. The Commission considered the recommendation from New
Zealand to include the Russian-flagged vessel Palmer on the
Contracting Party IUU list, but could not reach consensus on
including it on the List in 2020.
8. Due to the fact that SCIC had only informal virtual meetings in
2020, the Commission concluded that it was not possible to adopt
the 2020 Compliance Report.
Administration and Finance
9. The Commission approved the recommendations of the General
Capacity Building Fund Panel and agreed to fund two capacity
building projects, from Ukraine and Uruguay. The Commission
noted that the terms of reference for the General Science Capacity
Fund (GSCF) will be finalised for presentation in 2021.
10. The Commission reappointed Dr Agnew as Executive Secretary
for 2022–2026.
Management of marine resources
11. The Commission noted that up to 1 October 2020 the total
catch of krill reported for the 2019/20 fishing season was 446 783
tonnes, and that this was the largest catch ever reported in Area 48.
The total catch of Dissostichus eleginoides was 11 924 tonnes and
of Dissostichus mawsoni was 4 399 tonnes.
12. The Commission welcomed the significant amount of focussed
work that has been undertaken by the Scientific Committee and its
working groups in 2020 on developing the revised krill
management strategy.
13. Norway presented the preliminary results of a trial of measures
to mitigate seabird interactions with net monitoring cables on krill
fishing vessels. A dedicated correspondence group has been
organised in the 2020/21 intersessional period to address issues
regarding seabird strikes on net monitoring cables and warps.
14. The Commission renewed all the conservation measures that
were due to lapse in 2020. The revised schedule is available at:
www.ccamlr.org/node/112002.
Other business
15. Due to the constraints of the online meeting, several items that
would normally be considered in the main agenda of the
Commission were discussed instead under other business.
16. The Commission agreed to establish an e-group aimed at
facilitating discussions on reinforcing the objective of the
Convention, to pave the way for the Commission’s 40th meeting.
17. The Commission noted that the designation of the newly
exposed marine area adjacent to Pine Island Glacier as a Stage 1
Special Area for Scientific Study (see paragraph 14 in the report of
CCAMLR-38 above) will expire on 31 May 2021. The Commission
could not reach agreement on a proposal to extend this deadline by
one further year or to designate the area as a Stage 2 Special Area
for Scientific Study.
18. The Commission noted revised proposals to establish MPAs in
Domain 1 (Antarctic Peninsula), the East Antarctic and in the
Weddell Sea region.
19. The Commission also noted the development of new terms of
reference for the climate change egroup in order to further the
development of mechanisms to ensure the latest climate change
research is integrated into the work of the Scientific Committee and
considered in the development of management advice for the
Commission.
Next meeting
20. Sweden (Dr J. Granit) will Chair the Commission for the 2021
and 2022 meetings. Argentina (Mr M. Gowland) will continue to
serve as Vice-Chair. Ms M. Engelke-Ros (USA) was elected to the
Chair of SCIC and Ms S. Langerock (Belgium) to the Chair of SCAF
for the years 2021–2022.
21. The 40th Meeting of the Commission will be held in Hobart,
Australia, from 18 to 29 October 2021, unless the Commission
decides otherwise. The Commission asked that planning for the
meetings begin early, and include planning for formal meetings of
SCIC and SCAF.
