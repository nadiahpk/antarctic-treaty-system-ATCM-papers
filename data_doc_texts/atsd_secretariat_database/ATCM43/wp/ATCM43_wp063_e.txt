COVID-19 and Antarctica
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand, Argentina, Australia,
Chile, Norway, the United Kingdom, and SCAR
Summary
The 2021 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting will be held
virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, one of the most
devastating pandemics in history. New Zealand, Argentina,
Australia, Chile, Norway, the United Kingdom and SCAR consider
that a Resolution to mark this extraordinary circumstance would be
appropriate. A draft Resolution is attached for Parties’
consideration. It aims to record the implications of the pandemic for
our work, and commit to continuing the important cooperation,
fundamental to the Antarctic Treaty System, to manage risks to
people in Antarctica and to Antarctic wildlife.
Recommendation
New Zealand Argentina, Australia, Chile, Norway, the United
Kingdom and SCAR recommend that the ATCM considers the
attached draft Resolution, amends it as appropriate and through its
adoption, commits to ongoing cooperation to minimise COVID-19’s
disruption to the Antarctic Treaty System’s work.
Draft Resolution
COVID-19 and Antarctica
The Representatives,
Acknowledging that the 2021 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
will be held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, one of the
most devastating pandemics in history;
Acknowledging also that the 2020 Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
Further acknowledging the COVID-19 pandemic’s significant
implications for the facilitation of scientific research and
international scientific cooperation in Antarctica since March 2020;
Celebrating the strong international cooperation and information
sharing in the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty System that has
managed risks to people in Antarctica and to Antarctic wildlife
resulting from COVID-19 and that will support the management of
any future similar risks;
Acknowledging and appreciating the important roles played by
COMNAP, SCAR and IAATO to that end;
Desiring to continue momentum on our priority work in the
furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty and to
continue to take a strongly precautionary approach to manage
COVID-19 related risks;
Recommend that their governments:
Undertake to make progress on key issues of importance to the
management of Antarctica and minimise the disruption to the work
of the ATCM and CEP brought about by the global COVID-19
pandemic;
Undertake to that end to continue using innovative means to
cooperate amongst Parties, Observers, and Invited Expert
organisations, including through intersessional processes;
Commit to ongoing cooperation to ensure that COVID-19 risks to
people in Antarctica and to Antarctic wildlife are minimised;
Encourage the continued cooperation, information sharing and
development of best practice between National Antarctic
Programmes, COMNAP, SCAR and IAATO to prevent the future
transfer of COVID-19 to Antarctica and to support scientific
research programmes to continue safely;
Further encourage National Antarctic Programmes, COMNAP, SCAR
and IAATO to continue to developing protocols and guidelines,
drawing on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 experience in
preparation for any future similar eventualities.
