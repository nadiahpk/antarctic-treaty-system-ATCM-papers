Review of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected
Areas (ASPAs) No. 113 Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbor, Palmer
Archipelago, No. 119 Davis Valley and Forlidas Pond, Dufek Massif,
and No. 139 Biscoe Point, Palmer Archipelago.
Review of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected
Areas (ASPAs) No. 113 Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbor, Palmer
Archipelago, No. 119 Davis Valley and Forlidas Pond, Dufek Massif,
and No. 139 Biscoe Point, Palmer Archipelago
The Management Plans for ASPAs No. 113 Litchfield Island and No.
139 Biscoe Point were last reviewed in 2014, and review of these
sites under Annex V thus fell due in 2019. The Management Plan
for ASPA No. 119 Davis Valley and Forlidas Pond was last reviewed
in 2015 and review of this site under Annex V fell due in 2020.
Accordingly, the United States reviewed permits issued for visits to
these Areas since the previous reviews undertaken and has also
reviewed the Management Plans.
No visits to ASPA No. 119 Davis Valley and Forlidas Pond have
been made since the last management plan update, and no changes
to the description of the Area or policies in the management plans
were required. Minor updates to the plan were made to maintain
consistency with other management plans recently adopted and the
latest agreements by Antarctic Treaty Parties.
Visits continue to be made to ASPAs No. 113 Litchfield Island and
No. 139 Biscoe Point as part of on-going research programs being
conducted out of Palmer Station (US). Minor updates to the
management plans were made taking into account recent
information on the status of the features within the Areas, and to
maintain consistency with other management plans recently
adopted and the latest agreements by Antarctic Treaty Parties. For
example, the policy on waste disposal at ASPA No.113 Litchfield
Island was amended to require all wastes, including all human
wastes, to be removed from the Area, maintaining consistency with
other ASPAs in the region (Section 7(ix)).
Latin names for South polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) and
Brown skua (Stercorarius lonnbergi) recently changed to Catharacta
maccormicki and Catharacta antarctica respectively (see BirdLife
International Data Zone: http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/search
Accessed Jan 2021). The management plans have been amended as
appropriate.
At ASPA No.139 Biscoe Point the policy on restricted materials
(Section 7(vi)) was clarified to prohibit raw poultry, reducing the
risk of inadvertent import of viruses or other avian diseases.
The exceptional values of these Areas remain valid, and the
management plans continue to protect these values at the sites.
The standard checklist for consideration and review of ASPAs has
been completed for each site, and these are presented in the
following pages.
As such, the United States recommends that special protection of
ASPAs No. 113 Litchfield Island, No. 119 Davis Valley and Forlidas
Pond, and No. 139 Biscoe Point continues, and that the
Management Plans for these sites continue to remain in force with
the minor updates and changes included in the plans as attached.
The United States requests consideration by the Committee for
Environmental Protection to recommend to the Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting that adoption of the management plans for
these sites be continued for an indefinite period and that the five-
year period until the next review is due is reset.
