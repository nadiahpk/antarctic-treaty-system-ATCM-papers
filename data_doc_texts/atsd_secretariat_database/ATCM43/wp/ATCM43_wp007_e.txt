Revised Visitor Site Guidelines for Site No. 28 Seabee Hook, Cape
Hallett, Northern Victoria Land, Ross Sea
The Visitor Site Guidelines (VSG) for Seabee Hook were first
adopted in 2010 after a proposal by the United States of America,
when substantial revisions were made to the management plan for
the adjacent Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 106
Cape Hallett.
The VSG for Seabee Hook have not been revised since first
adoption, although minor formatting edits were made by the
Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in 2018.
In 2021 the management plan review for ASPA No.106 Cape Hallett
identified the need for minor alterations to the northern boundary
of the protected area because of new data showing changes to the
extent of the large Adélie penguin colony on Seabee Hook.
The VSG for Seabee Hook areas have a common boundary with the
ASPA, and it was therefore necessary to update the guidelines so
they are mutually consistent.
Several minor editorial improvements and clarifications have been
made in the course of the review. For example, the number of
breeding pairs of Adélie penguins on Seabee Hook was updated in
accordance with the latest count of ~47,000 made by the Republic
of Korea in 2017. The order of latitude / longitude coordinates was
revised to follow accepted international convention, which gives
latitude first. The site map for the VSG was updated and improved.
Recommendation
Revised Visitor Site Guidelines for Site No. 28 Seabee Hook are
attached for consideration by the Committee for Environmental
Protection for recommendation for adoption by the Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting.
