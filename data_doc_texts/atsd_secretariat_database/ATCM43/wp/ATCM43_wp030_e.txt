Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected
Area (ASPA) No. 167 Hawker Island, Princess Elizabeth Land
Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected
Area (ASPA) No. 167 Hawker Island, Princess Elizabeth Land
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
In accordance with Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia has
undertaken a five-yearly review of the management plan for
Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 167 Hawker Island. The
review was conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to
the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially
Protected Areas (the Guide) appended to Resolution 2 (2011). The
following sections briefly describe the Area, and describe the
proposed minor amendments to the management plan. Australia
recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised
management plan.
Background
Hawker Island (the Area) (68°38’S, 77°51’E) is located 7 km south-
west from Davis station off the Vestfold Hills on the Ingrid
Christensen Coast, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica. The
island was designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA)
No. 167 under Measure 1 (2006), following a proposal by Australia,
primarily to protect the southernmost breeding colony of southern
giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus). The Area is one of only four
known breeding locations for southern giant petrels in East
Antarctica, all of which are ASPAs: ASPA 102, Rookery Islands,
Holme Bay, Mac.Robertson Land (67º36’S, 62º53’E) – near Mawson
Station; ASPA 160, Frazier Islands, Wilkes Land (66°13’S, 110°11’E)
– near Casey station; and ASPA 120, Pointe Géologie, Terre Adélie
(66º40’S, 140º01’E) – near Dumont d’Urville. Hawker Island also
supports breeding colonies of Adélie penguins (Pygocelis adeliae),
south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki), and Cape petrels
(Daption capense). Occasionally Southern elephant seal (Nirounga
leonine) haul out on the southern beaches and Weddell seals
(Leptonychotes weddellii) pup on the sea ice nearby.
Review of management plan
The review of the management plan involved a literature review,
and consultation with personnel permitted to enter the Area during
the past five years and ornithologists who are familiar with the
Area. The revisions to the management plan seek to afford
enhanced protection of the values that the Area was designated to
protect.
Summary of amendments to the management plan for ASPA 167
A revised management plan for ASPA 167 is presented at
Attachment A. No major changes are proposed, and there are no
changes to the Area boundary. Proposed minor amendments are
summarised as follows:
The Introduction has been modified to more accurately describe
areas used by seals within and near the Area.
Section 2 has been revised for consistency with other management
plans, to reflect that management of the Area aims to allow visits
for management purposes in support of the aims of the management
plan and to protect the values of the Area as a reference area for
future comparative studies with other breeding populations of
southern giant petrels.
Section 6(i) has been revised to:
Note that the Area is located in Antarctic Conservation
Biogeographic Region 7 East Antarctica, and is not identified as an
Antarctic Important Bird Area.
Include updated counts for southern giant petrel chicks (2020).
Update the number of offshore islands where Adelie penguins
breed.
Update the number of Adelie penguin pairs that breed in the
Vestfold Hills (2009/10).
Remove a sentence that did not have any management implications.
Include the number of Cape petrel pairs (2017/18).
Note that South polar skuas may breed near the penguin colony.
Mention additional southern elephant seal haul out locations in the
Vestfold Hills.
Section 6(ii) has been revised to include additional information on
preferred landing sites for boats accessing the Area.
Section 7(ii) has been revised to include conditions regarding the
use of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), stating that
overflights of bird colonies are prohibited except where essential for
compelling scientific or management purposes, noting that such
overflights shall be undertaken in accordance with the
Environmental guidelines for operation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft
Systems (RPAS) in Antarctica.
Section (iv) has been revised to state that structure installation,
modification and removal, should, if possible, be carried out during
the non-breeding period for SGP.
Section 7(vii) has been revised to state that, where feasible,
preference should be given to activities and methodologies that
minimise disturbance to breeding birds.
Section 8 has been revised to update with relevant, recent
publications, and minor corrections.
Map B has been revised to include location of small Cape petrel
colony.
Editorial amendments have been made throughout.

Land.
