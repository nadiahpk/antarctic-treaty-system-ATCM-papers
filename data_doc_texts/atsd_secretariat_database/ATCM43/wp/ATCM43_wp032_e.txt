As the ATCM was sadly cancelled in 2020, in light of the global
Covid-19 pandemic, ATCMXLIII in 2021 is the first meeting of the
Parties since the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere
in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The SROCC, which has been
approved and accepted by the IPCC plenary, assimilates the
evidence that climate change is having a profound impact on
Antarctica, and that these impacts have consequential global effects.
Some of the SROCC key findings in relation to Antarctica include
the acceleration of ice flow and retreat in the Amundsen Sea
Embayment of West Antarctica and in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica,
which has the potential to lead to global mean sea-level rise of
several metres within a few centuries. The report also highlights
future changes to ocean circulation because of the significant
amounts of human-produced heat and dissolved carbon in the
Southern Ocean. It also projects changes in the distribution of krill,
which will have consequential implications for the wider Antarctic
ecosystem, including shifts in abundance and distribution of
Antarctic mammals, birds and fish.
Whilst the mitigation of global climate change from ongoing global
warming is for another body, the ATCM is seized of the implications
of climate change on the protection and management of Antarctica,
and has a role to play in researching and communicating Antarctic
climate change science to the international audience.
Given the stark findings of the SROCC report on the future likely
implications for Antarctica, including as a result of warming trends
already in the global system, the UK, Belgium, Australia, Finland,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain,
Sweden and the United States recommend that the ATCM adopt an
updated Resolution on climate change. A draft is attached.
Draft Resolution
Antarctica in a Changing Climate
The Representatives,
Conscious of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing
Climate (SROCC), which has been approved and accepted by the
IPCC plenary, and its Summary for Policy Makers,
Concerned at the implications to Antarctica from a warming global
climate, identified in the SROCC, including increasing melting of
the West Antarctic ice sheet, and changes to Antarctic and Southern
Ocean ecosystems,
Further concerned about the global implications of Antarctic
change, notably sea-level rise and ocean circulation,
Recalling Resolution 6 (2015) and remaining committed to
communicating Antarctic climate change research internationally,
Welcoming the regular updates by the Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR) of its Antarctic Climate Change and the
Environment report and looking forward to receiving further advice
in due course emanating from SCAR’s three new climate change
focused Scientific Research Programmes: INSTANT, AntClimnow
and Ant-ICON,
Recalling also Resolution 4 (2015) and welcoming the ongoing
implementation of the Committee for Environmental Protection’s
(CEP) Climate Change Response Work Programme, and the annual
updates provided by the CEP to the ATCM,
Recognising the importance of the implementation of the Paris
Agreement to avoid the worst-case scenario implications for
Antarctica projected by the IPCC,
Determined to seek ways to address the effects of climate and
environmental change on the Antarctic environment and dependent
and associated ecosystems,
Recommend that their Governments:
Ensure their delegations to the next UNFCCC Conference of the
Parties, planned for Glasgow in November 2021, are aware of the
implications for Antarctica, unless action is taken to avoid
dangerous climate change. In particular, the projections of its
contribution to global sea-level rise, and the implications for
upholding the commitment in the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to the comprehensive protection
of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated
ecosystems;
Incorporate climate change considerations into the management of
all human activities in Antarctica to seek to avoid or mitigate any
additional stresses to the Antarctic terrestrial and marine
environment, including its biodiversity and ecosystems, in order to
increase resilience to climate change effects;
Support their national Antarctic programmes and SCAR in their
ongoing efforts to undertake research about climate change and its
impacts, and to communicate the implications for Antarctica, both
within the Antarctic Treaty System and internationally.
