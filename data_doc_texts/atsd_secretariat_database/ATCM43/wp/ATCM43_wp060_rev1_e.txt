Reformatting of the list of Historic Sites and Monuments in line
with Decision 1 (2019)
Reformatting of the list of Historic Sites and Monuments in line
with Decision 1 (2019)
Submitted by: Argentina, Norway and United Kingdom
Background
ATCM XLII (2019) agreed to the incorporation of new fields of
information to the list of Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs), as
set out in Decision 1 (2019), in order to ensure consistency, be
more informative and align with recent developments in HSM
policies and discussions amongst Parties. Further background
information and analysis providing the background for this
discussion is found in ATCM XLII WP 65 submitted by Argentina.
Decision 1 (2019) specifies that the following new fields of
information shall be included in the list, in addition to the existing
fields of “No.”, “Description”, “Location” and “Designation/
Amendment”:
a. Name; b. Type; c. Conservation status; d. Description of the
historical context; e. Applicable criteria in accordance with
Resolution 3 (2009); f. Management tools; g. Photographs; h.
Physical features of the environment and cultural and local context;
Decision 1 (2019) furthermore encouraged Parties to provide
information for these new fields and requested the Secretariat to
create an online forum on the Committee for Environmental
Protection (CEP) discussion forum where Parties undertaking
management could share information relevant to an HSM. This was
then to be used as basis to facilitate the drafting of a Working Paper
for ATCM XLIII presenting a list of the HSMs incorporating the new
fields of information.
Process of reformatting the list
Since 2019, the CEP Chair (Norway) and Vice-Chairs (Argentina
and the United Kingdom), with substantial assistance from the
Secretariat, have worked through the CEP forum and through direct
contact with Members to reformat the HSM list according to
Decision 1 (2019). Original proponents of each HSM have, in
collaboration with interested Parties as appropriate, provided input
on the HSMs. The full list has thereafter been reviewed and
adjusted to ensure as much consistency and comparability between
listings as possible and appropriate. All information has been open
to all Members at all times, enabling Members to comment and
suggest adjustments on any of the HSMs on the list.
The information fields
Some details about and observations made during the process of
populating the new information fields (denoted in underlined bold
below) are worth highlighting:
Location: To ensure compatibility and appropriate functionality
within the developed database, and the ability to automatically
generate location maps based on the information, this information
field only contains one latitude and one longitude coordinate. In the
instances where additional information exists, this information is
found in the field entitled “Physical features of the environment and
cultural and local context”
Type: Throughout the process, we thoroughly reviewed the
information provided in this information field to ensure
consistency, both for users and for database purposes. We have
adjusted the list of available categories slightly and have used the
following set of categories:
Building: hut
Building: station
Building: other building remains
Site
Other remains: expedition cairn
Other remains: tent
Other remains: lighthouse
Other remains: shipwreck
Other remains: other
Commemorative item: plaque
Commemorative item: bust
Commemorative item: cross
Commemorative item: other
Conservation status and Management tools: The type of information
provided by Parties in these two information fields varies
substantially across the (currently) 89 HSMs. This is both a
reflection of different national approaches to management of
historic sites and the uniqueness of the individual HSMs. We have
suggested avoiding time-specific information in these fields (for
example the implementation of a specific conservation project next
season), as this will require constant updating of the list/database,
which for practical purposes should be avoided.
Applicable criteria: Criteria listed are in accordance with those
adopted through Resolution 3 (2009), i.e.:
a particular event of importance in the history of science or
exploration of Antarctica occurred at the place;
a particular association with a person who played an important role
in the history of science or exploration in Antarctica;
a particular association with a notable feat of endurance or
achievement;
representative of, or forms part of, some wide-ranging activity that
has been important in the development and knowledge of
Antarctica;
particular technical, historical, cultural or architectural value in its
materials, design or method of construction;
the potential, through study, to reveal information or has the
potential to educate people about significant human activities in
Antarctica;
symbolic or commemorative value for people of many nations.
Future updating of the list
The new format of the HSM list makes the list more of a living
document than it has been up to now. In particular, the fields
relating to conservation status and management tools contain
information that may require relatively frequent updating due to
the nature of the information contained there.
Listings of HSMs is a formal mechanism established through the
Environmental Protocol, and any changes to the list have
historically required a separate Measure. To avoid the need to adopt
a new Measure for minor changes (including for example updates to
management tools)in the fields that provide information about the
status and management of the site we suggest that:
The information contained in the fields entitled “No.”,
“Description”, “Location”, “Name”, “Type”, “Description of the
historical context”, “Applicable criteria in accordance with
Resolution 3 (2009)” and “Physical features of the environment and
cultural and local context” continues to be a formal part of the HSM
list and any changes to these fields require adoption through a
Measure.
Information contained in the fields “Conservation status”,
“Management tools” “Designation/Amendment” and “Photographs”
is considered required supplementary information to the HSM-list
for which any changes should be agreed by the CEP and noted in its
report to the ATCM.
Availability of list
When the HSM list has been adopted in its new format the
Secretariat will move all information into an online database
available from the ATS website. The Secretariat will ensure that the
list is kept up do date and that all approved future changes or
additions to the list are incorporated appropriately. The database
will be available to the public at large, and as such have a greater
outreach potential than a static list in a .pdf format. Figure 1 shows
a screen shot of how information from the database will be
portrayed on the website.
Guide to the presentation of Working Papers containing proposals
for Historic Sites and Monuments
The Guide to the presentation of Working Papers containing
proposals for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, Antarctic
Specially Managed Areas or Historic Sites and Monuments, adopted
through Resolution 3 (2018) provides a template (Template B) for
coversheets to follow working papers proposing new historic sites
and monuments. Following Decision 1 (2019), Template B needs to
be updated to reflect the agreed additional information required for
listings. Appendix D includes the Guide containing a draft revised
version of Template B. Appendix E contains a draft Resolution for
the adoption of the updated Guide to the presentation of Working
Papers containing proposals for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas,
Antarctic Specially Managed Areas or Historic Sites and
Monuments.
Proposal
The Committee agrees to forward the reformatted HSM list
contained in Appendix A to the ATCM for adoption through a
Measure. A draft Measure to that effect is attached as Appendix B.
The Committee agrees to recommend to the ATCM that:
The information contained in the fields entitled “No.”,
“Description”, “Location”, “Name”, “Type”, “Description of the
historical context”, “Applicable criteria in accordance with
Resolution 3 (2009)” and “Physical features of the environment and
cultural and local context” continue to be a formal part of the HSM
list and any changes to these fields require adoption through a
Measure.
Information contained in the fields “Conservation status”,
“Management tools”, “Designation/Amendment” and “Photographs”
can be considered required supplementary information to the HSM
list, for which any changes should be agreed by the CEP and noted
in its report to the ATCM.
A draft Decision to this effect is attached as Appendix C.
The Committee suggests that the Secretariat is requested to
populate the database with the information provided for the new
format and make the information available through the ATS
website, in accordance with Decision 1 (2019) as soon as possible.
The Committee endorses the revised Guide to the presentation of
Working Papers containing proposals for Antarctic Specially
Protected Areas, Antarctic Specially Managed Areas or Historic Sites
and Monuments (Appendix D), to reflect the information required
for listings of new HSMs in accordance with Decision 1 (2019) and
agrees to forward to the ATCM for adoption a draft Resolution
(Appendix E) on updating the Guide.
