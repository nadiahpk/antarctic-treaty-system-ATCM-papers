Ocean Acidification in the Southern Ocean
Ocean Acidification in the Southern Ocean
Ocean acidification is the other carbon dioxide problem and has
been referred to as “the evil twin” of global warming. Turley et al.
2005, Henderson 2006, Doney et al. 2009, and Morford 2015.
Introduction
The world’s oceans are inexorably evolving toward a state of
acidification dissimilar to what has been witnessed throughout
human history, this anthropogenic phenomenon is termed Ocean
Acidification (OA).1 The coupled physical/chemical changes have
far-reaching consequences for marine habitats, organisms,
ecosystems and ecosystem services. Predicted intensification of OA
in the coming decades will likely disrupt physiological processes
and reduce calcification, development, and fecundity in a range of
organisms (Gattuso et al. 2015, Sosdian et al. 2019). As with global
temperatures, the rate of OA is as concerning as the degree of
change (Turley et al. 2006, Table 1). Acidification is accelerating
faster than previously estimated driven by the increasing rate of
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (Zeebe and Zachos 2013, Negrete-
García et al. 2019). Atmospheric gas trapped in Antarctic ice cores
show that current concentrations of CO2 are unprecedented in the
last 800,000 years (Lüthi et al 2008). Since the last ice age, the rate
of temperature and CO2-increase has been two orders of magnitude
lower than during the current era of anthropogenic change. The
rate of change in ocean acidification today is seldom observed in
the geological record and the resilience of ecosystems to gradual
change in the past cannot be assumed to be the same as today.

The mechanisms and processes that couple atmospheric CO2
concentrations with ocean chemistry are well understood. About a
third of the CO2 humans have emitted since the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution
has been taken up by the oceans (Doney et al. 2009, Le Quéré et al.,
2016, Sosdian et al. 2019). It takes hundreds of years for the oceans
come to equilibrium with the atmosphere. Therefore, acidification
will continue to increase even if atmospheric CO2 concentrations
were stabilized at today’s levels. The Southern Ocean is the
dominant ocean for carbon storage – accounting for ~40% of global
oceanic CO2 uptake (Frölicher et al. 2015). The influx of
anthropogenic CO2 has resulted in a change in ocean surface water
acidity expressed as a lowering of pH and carbonate saturation state
(Bates et al. 2014, Sosdian et al. 2019). The pH scale is logarithmic
(1 pH unit is a tenfold change in acidity) and over the last 250
years ocean acidity has increased twenty-nine percent (Hall-Spencer
et al. 2008, Table 1). This rate of change is 10 times faster than that
experienced by the oceans in millions of years (Turley et al. 2006,
Hönisch et al. 2012, Negrete-García et al., 2019, Hall-Spencer and
Harvey 2019).2
Oceanic uptake of CO2 is not constant and varies by region. In the
1990s, ocean CO2 uptake decreased, before increasing again in the
2000s. Recent research shows that the Southern Ocean was central
to these changes (DeVries et al. 2017). In the 1990s, strengthening
winds circulating around Antarctica affected ocean currents and
brought carbon-rich water to the surface decreasing ocean CO2
uptake from the atmosphere. The rate at which CO2 is transferred
from the air into seawater depends on the difference in the
concentration of CO2 in the air, and that in the water. As human
activities add more CO2 to the atmosphere, this concentration
difference increases, and the ocean absorbs more CO2. Due to the
long timescales of oceanic mixing, the distribution of CO2 in the
oceans is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. As CO2 dissolves
in the ocean, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in
seawater increases, pH declines and concentrations of other
components of the marine carbonate system adjust. Concentrations
of carbonate ions, the building blocks of aragonite and calcite
(types of carbonate), may fall below saturation levels, threatening
carbonate-habitats and the health and physiology of carbonate-
exploiting species. The amount of CO2 that can dissolve in seawater
is greater at colder temperatures and higher pressures. As such, the
lowest pH and carbonate ion concentrations are in the polar oceans
and the deep sea For the Southern Ocean, the Saturation Horizon is
estimated at ~750-1000 m for aragonite and ~3100–3400 m for
calcite (Bostock et al. 2013). There is considerable regional
variation in these depths, reflecting differences in water masses and
their circulation.. These factors tend to amplify the effects of
acidification in the Southern Ocean compared to other oceans. The
depth within the water column below which seawater is corrosive
to carbonate (the “Saturation Horizon”) is becoming shallower
impinging on larger areas of the sea floor4. As such, habitats
exposed to seawater that is corrosive to aragonite are increasing.
Predictions under the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway
8.5 suggest that by 2100 oceanic pH (est. pH = 7.8, Table 1) will
be at the lowest level ever reached over the last 14 million years
(Sosdian et al. 2019).
The effects of OA on living systems are not well understood.
Extrapolation of laboratory and mesocosm responses to real-world
scenarios is uncertain and field observations are limited, especially
for Antarctic environments. However, extreme and rapid OA in the
geologic past resulted in mass extinctions (Clarkson et al. 2015,
Sosdian et al. 2019).
Ocean Acidification has been on the ATCM/CEP agenda for more
than a decade. OA was first highlighted to ATCM XXXII (2008) in
IP062 Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment: A progress
report. OA was highlighted at ATCM XXXII (2009) and XXXVIII
(2015) in SCAR science lectures (ATCM XXXII IP071 The SCAR
Lecture – Marine Life and Change in the Southern Ocean and ATCM
XXXVIII BP001 SCAR Lecture: Southern Ocean Acidification). The
2010 Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME) noted that “ocean
acidification must come high on the list of climate change related
issues most likely to have maximum impact”. In subsequent years,
further IPs were submitted by SCAR (see Annex A) and ASOC
(ATCM XXXIV IP088 Ocean Acidification and the Southern Ocean).
From 2018 onwards the CEP’s five-year workplan has highlighted
the ‘assessment on impact of ocean acidification to marine biota
and ecosystems as a Science knowledge and information need’, and
it is also highlighted in the CEP’s current Climate Change Response
Work Programme. The SCAR Action Group on Ocean Acidification
ran from 2012-2018. As a cross-cutting issue, a range of SCAR
groups have made contributions to understanding the impacts of
OA on marine ecosystems (e.g., AnT-ERA, ICED, ASPeCt).
Southern Ocean Environments
In the open Southern Ocean, far from land, pH and carbonate
saturation state are stable. In contrast, acidity in coastal areas is
variable due to varying inputs of nutrients, freshwater and
sediments from the surrounding land, and from melting ice. A
changing climate is altering these inputs. In addition, the upwelling
of cold CO2-laden upper circumpolar deep water has increased in
recent decades (Smith et al. 2017). Regardless, Antarctic coastal
waters have a narrower pH range than temperate and tropical
regions, with the highest levels occurring during periods of
enhanced summer primary production (Hofmann et al. 2011,
Matson et al. 2011; Conrad and Lovenduski 2015; Kapsenberg et al.
2015; Schram et al. 2015).
Biological responses to OA are expressed at the molecular,
organismal, population, community and ecosystem levels. Different
species have characteristics or traits (e.g., reproduction, dispersal,
growth, feeding, habitat) which may be affected by OA.
Vulnerabilities to acidification, and other environmental factors
(e.g., warming and freshening), vary with life-stage. Larval forms
are often more sensitive to environmental change. Understanding
these complex interactions is crucial for forecasting biotic responses
to increasing acidification but much remains unknown.
Marine organisms with shells or skeletons of calcium carbonate
become vulnerable as sea water carbonate ion concentrations
decrease to levels that dissolve these structures. However, non-
calcifiers can also be affected by acidification. Effects may be direct
(e.g., reduced pH disrupts organismal functions; Pörtner 2008), or
indirect (e.g., altered food webs, behavioural changes). While
studies in the Antarctic are limited, increased OA elsewhere,
particularly at natural CO2 vents that acidify surrounding waters,
has caused shifts in algal community composition and alteration of
coastal habitats. Increased availability of bicarbonate and pCO2 can
stimulate primary production (Hall-Spencer and Harvey 2019).
Carbon fixation is increased, enhancing standing stocks of large
seaweeds and seagrasses. Many macrofauna are susceptible to the
effects of OA. For example, there was a ~30% decline in animal
biodiversity as pH decreased from 8.1 to 7.8. Corals are the most
recognized habitat-forming marine animals, but a diverse range of
other groups build calcareous seabed habitats such as sponges,
serpulids, vermetids, oysters, mussels and bryozoans. Studies along
pH gradients at northern, natural CO2-seep sites documented that
increased acidity reduced ecosystem diversity, species richness and
spatial heterogeneity (Hall-Spencer and Harvey 2019). The
complexity and multi-directional nature of biotic responses makes it
difficult to generalize.
As in other regions of the world, studies of the ecophysiological
responses of Antarctic organisms to OA have shown a wide range of
effects. Changes in carbonate chemistry may negatively affect the
ability of Antarctic molluscs to form and maintain shells (e.g.,
Manno et al. 2017, Bylenga et al. 2017, Gardner et al. 2018). Many
shelled Antarctic benthic invertebrates are less calcified than their
temperate or tropical counterparts (Watson et al. 2012) which may
increase vulnerability to acidification. In closely related groups,
other physiological processes can be, but are not always, negatively
impacted. For example, in three co-occurring benthic invertebrate
species, gonadal development was reduced in a mollusc (scallop)
but only in one of two echinoderms (sea urchin but not sea star;
Dell’Acqua et al. 2019). In the keystone pelagic crustacean, adult
Antarctic krill, short-term exposure resulted in several forms of
likely physiological stress (Saba et al. 2012) but no detrimental
impacts were observed in a year-long study (Ericson et al. 2018,
2019) indicating that the krill are able to physiologically adapt. In
contrast, ecologically important benthic crustaceans (amphipods)
can have high mortality (Schram et al. 2016a,b, Park et al. 2020).
Microscopic and macroscopic algae can, although do not always,
benefit physiologically from increased pCO2 (e.g., Iñiguez et al.
2017, Cummings et al. 2019, Trimborn et al. 2019) but it can also
decrease silica (cell wall) production in ecologically important
planktonic microalgae (diatoms), potentially altering not only their
vulnerability to herbivores but also carbon transport to the deep sea
(Petrou et al. 2019). Overall, ocean acidification reduces the
complexity, extent and species richness of biogenic reefs. The
potential for organismal adaptation in the longer term has been
noted. For example, brachiopods produced a thicker shell,
presumably as protection against dissolution in response to
acidification (Cross et al. 2019). Further, Sterechnius urchins
appeared to acclimate in longer-term studies (Morley et al. 2016,
Suckling et al. 2015).
Studies of the effects of OA on higher trophic levels are limited.
Direct – albeit minor – effects have been documented for some
notothenioid fishes Metabolic responses to CO2 increases were
negligible to minor but there were differences in the magnitude of
responses between different species and life stages (Enzor et al.
2017; Davis et al. 2017; Flynn et al. 2015).. Direct effects of OA on
other higher order taxa in the Southern Ocean are unknown
(Constable et al. 2014). Marine mammals and birds respond to
changes in the production, distribution and dynamics of prey
species (Morley et al. 2019), including moving to alternative
locations for food. This has energetic cost implications for species
that are undertaking longer or more complex foraging trips,
especially for those that are bound to breeding colonies (Constable
et al. 2014). Understanding how prey species respond to OA is key
to understanding predators’ responses. Krill reproduction is
predicted to decline under increasing acidification and krill-feeding
predators may be negatively impacted (Kawaguchi et al. 2013).
Antarctic krill are the target of the largest fishery in the Southern
Ocean. Recent local concentration of this fishery is likely causing
reduced performance for penguins when local harvest rate is high in
years of low krill biomass combined with poorer environmental
conditions (Watters et al. 2020). The negative effect of acidification
on krill reproduction projected into the future (Kawaguchi et al.
2013) could magnify this negative effect on krill predators. Studies
along pH gradients at northern, natural CO2-seep sites documented
that increased acidification degraded carbonate habitats
compromising coastal protection and habitat provisioning for
fisheries.
OA and warming have synergistic effects that exacerbate the risk of
population declines in sensitive species. Combined with rising
temperatures, sea-level rise and more frequent and higher
magnitude/amplitude extreme events; OA threatens the goods and
services provided by ecosystems. For example, although increased
temperature had no effect alone on amphipod survival, it
synergistically increased mortality in lower pH treatments (Schram
et al. 2016a). Additionally, decreased pH alone had little impact on
a variety of physiological or behavioural metrics in a fish but it
inhibited the fish’s ability to physiologically compensate for
increases in temperature (Davis et al. 2018).
Concluding Remarks
The Southern Ocean will continue to acidify for decades, and
possibly centuries, as the ocean equilibrates with atmospheric CO2
concentrations. OA attributable to anthropogenic CO2 already
emitted is yet to be fully expressed in ocean chemistry. The reason
the planet takes several decades to respond to increased CO2 is the
thermal inertia of the oceans regulates responses to increased
atmospheric CO2 taking decades to be completely expressed.
Changes in Antarctic oceanic and coastal environments caused by
OA will be amplified foretelling change in more northerly oceans.
The vulnerabilities of sensitive species may be heightened by
synergistic interactions with other climate-change effects (e.g.,
atmospheric and oceanic warming, sea-level rise, increased
storminess and changes in sea ice distribution and dynamics).
Biological and ecosystem responses to acidification in tropical, sub-
tropical and temperate coastal systems must be cautiously applied
when forecasting responses and effects in Antarctic marine biota
and environments (Hall-Spencer and Harvey 2019). Studies of
potential impacts on ecosystems are limited but altered food web
interactions and shifts in community composition can be expected,
along with changes in carbonate habitats, as carbonate stability
deteriorates. More information is needed on the ability of species to
adapt to long-term changes (e.g. across generations, Byrne et al.
2019) given the rate of ocean acidification (and warming).
Feedbacks with changes in sea-ice cover and warming temperatures
(freshening, especially in coastal areas) are poorly understood but
may be important in forecasting future responses. Mass extinctions
in the geologic past were associated with levels of OA that some
have projected by the year 2100, if CO2 emissions remain unabated
(Clarkson et al. 2015, Sosdian et al. 2019). As concerning, the
current rate of CO2 release is unprecedented in the geological
record (Hönish et al. 2012). If the trend of increasing emissions
continues, the magnitude and rate of future acidification will
increase, causing biological and ecological responses to intensify
and accelerate at a rate never observed in Earth’s history.
Consideration of OA trajectories and biotic impacts will be essential
for predicting futures and planning conservation efforts in the
Antarctic region.
