Assessment and management of pre-1958 historic remains at Camp
Lake, Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica
Assessment and management of pre-1958 historic remains at Camp
Lake, Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
Australia has assessed the heritage value of pre-1958 historic
remains in the vicinity of Camp Lake, Vestfold Hills, East
Antarctica, in accordance with the Guidelines for the assessment
and management of Heritage in Antarctica (Resolution 2 (2018)).
Nomination for HSM listing is not proposed, and the local value of
the site for interpreting early landings in the Vestfold Hills will be
protected through management arrangements put in place within
the Australian Antarctic Program. Accordingly, Australia
recommends that the Committee agrees that interim protection of
the remains under the Guidelines for handling pre-1958 historic
remains whose existence or present location is not known
(Resolution 5 (2001)) is no longer required.
Background
At CEP XXII (2019) Australia presented ATCM XLII/WP31
Notification of the discovery of pre-1958 historic remains at Camp
Lake, Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. In accordance with the
Guidelines for handling pre-1958 historic remains whose existence
or present location is not known (Resolution 5 (2001)), the paper
reported on the discovery of pre-1958 historic remains associated
with early Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions
activities in the vicinity of Camp Lake, Vestfold Hills, East
Antarctica. It also noted that, consistent with the Guidelines for the
assessment and management of Heritage in Antarctica (Resolution 2
(2018)), Australia was undertaking an assessment of the heritage
value of the historic remains, which would inform management
options. The Committee noted the information, acknowledged that
the remains would be subject to interim protection in accordance
with Resolution 5 (2001), and advised the ATCM accordingly CEP
XXII Final Report, paras. 120 & 122..
Assessment of heritage value of the historic remains at Camp Lake
Australia engaged a heritage professional with Antarctic expertise
to assess the heritage significance of the Camp Lake site and
associated objects consistent with the Guidelines for the assessment
and management of Heritage in Antarctica. As noted in ATCM XLII/
WP32, the historic remains stem from the Australian National
Antarctic Research Expedition’s early exploration of the Vestfold
Hills in 1955 and include: a rock cairn; two rock outlines of cleared
tent sites; remnants of wooden crates; wire; a bar of soap;
amphibious vehicle tracks; and a possible flag pole foundation.
The assessment noted that the objects do not appear to be at risk if
left untouched and, of themselves, do not appear to present an
environmental hazard or risk to each other. It concluded that the
site and objects are of negligible heritage significance in terms of
the criteria presented in the Guidelines for the assessment and
management of Heritage in Antarctica, but have local value for
interpreting early landings in the Vestfold Hills, which is best
protected by recording them and leaving them undisturbed.
Accordingly, Australia has decided to:
not nominate the site for listing as a Historic Site or Monument
(HSM); and
put in place arrangements within the Australian Antarctic Program
to protect the site and remains, including:
recording and monitoring the site and registering the artefacts on
Australia’s Antarctic heritage register;
developing management arrangements for visits to the site by
Australian Antarctic Program personnel;
providing information about the site to station leaders and on new
maps of the area, and making information available to
expeditioners and to the public; and
ensuring that the potential impacts of proposed activities on the
heritage values of the site are assessed through formal
environmental impact assessment processes consistent with the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
Recommendations
Australia recommends that the Committee:
notes that Australia has assessed the heritage value of the pre-1958
historic remains at Camp Lake, Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica in
accordance with the Guidelines for the assessment and management
of Heritage in Antarctica (Resolution 2 (2018));
notes that nomination of the site for HSM listing is not proposed,
and the local value of the site for interpreting early landings in the
Vestfold Hills will be protected through management arrangements
put in place within the Australian Antarctic Program; and
agrees that interim protection of the remains in accordance with the
Guidelines for handling pre-1958 historic remains whose existence
or present location is not known (Resolution 5 (2001)) is no longer
required.
