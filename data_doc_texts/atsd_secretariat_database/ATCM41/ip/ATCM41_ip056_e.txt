Liability Annex: Financial Security








Annex VI to the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protocol: Financial Security 
Information Paper submitted by the International Group of P&I Clubs

Background

    1. The International Group of P&I Clubs (IG) welcomed the opportunity to attend the ATCM XL in Beijing in 2017 to discuss Annex VI to the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protection and the financial security provisions contained therein and the scope of third party liability cover provided by the member P&I Associations of the IG.

    2. As background information, the 13 principal underwriting associations comprising the IG provide third party liability insurance cover for approximately 90% of the world’s ocean-going tonnage. The insurance cover provided by the Clubs is extensive and includes cover for liabilities of a shipowner arising from ship sourced pollution damage. The Rules on Club cover, that define the scope and terms of cover, are publicly accessible via the websites of each of the 13 Clubs (www.igpandi.org/group-clubs). Although the policy terms that are embodied in each of the Clubs’ Rules are individual to each Club, they differ little between the Clubs.  Many of the vessels operating in Antarctic waters maintain P&I cover with a member P&I Club of the IG.

    3. The IG appreciated the opportunity to discuss a number of issues at the ATCM XL related to Annex VI as set out in document IP 87 submitted to the meeting.

    4. The intention of this IP is to inform the meeting that the IG is continuing to analyze the issues raised in IP 87 and would welcome a further opportunity to discuss at the next ATCM in 2019 in order to assist implementation and application of Annex VI.
