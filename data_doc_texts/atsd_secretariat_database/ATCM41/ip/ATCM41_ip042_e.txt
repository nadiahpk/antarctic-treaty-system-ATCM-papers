Update on the proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) in the Western Sør Rondane Mountains

Information Paper Submitted by Belgium

Summary
Belgium has presented during CEP XX WP 42 “Prior assessment of a proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) in the Sør Rondane Mountains”. The Committee welcomed Belgium’s intention to further consider the development of a draft management plan for the area, and noted that several Members had expressed an interest to contribute to the work (see CEP XX report, §161 to 166). This Information Paper intends to provide an updated information to the Committee on the works carried out during the inter-sessional period. It intends also to deepen the discussion within the CEP before the progressive development of a draft management plan for the area.
Introduction
Belgium has built the Princess Elisabeth station on the Utsteinen Ridge in the Western Sør Rondane Mountains (Dronning Maud Land), and it was inaugurated in 2009. It is situated ca 180 km inland and at an altitude of ca 1360 m. The area of the Sør Rondane Mountains (SRM) is mountainous and the climate is harsh, with air temperatures always below 0°C. However, in particular ice-free locations, microclimatic and topographic features may be favourable for the growth of communities of mosses, lichens, microorganisms and invertebrates that form biofilms or Biological Soil Crusts (BSC). The growing sites are generally exposed to the North so that the solar energy can heat the rocks to reach positive temperatures. They are also relatively protected from the katabatic winds (orientation of the rocks, presence of crevasses or reliefs…), and some liquid water is produced by melting snow patches above the sites. The visible growth patches are more frequent on the big granite boulders than on the gneiss substrates that are often made of unstable pebbles. Besides these visible biological formations, molecular methods have shown that there are microorganisms in the soils, between the gravel grains, in cryptoendolithic habitats, in cryoconites, etc. 
In view of the biological and scientific values of the region that are explained below, several ice-free areas which are representative of the region and host a range of biological communities were selected as potential candidates. 
A general map of the region was created by the National Geographic Institute and included in annex (Fig. 1) to show the locations of the different sites in relation to the Princess Elisabeth Station.
The initially proposed ASPA included 5 sites: (1) Tanngarden Ridge, (2) Petrelanutten Nunatak,                   (3) range of Pingvinane Nunataks, (4) Perlebandet range, and (5) a part of the Teltet Nunatak.                    Except for the latter (gneiss rocks), the main rock type is granite. During the field season 2017-18, it became clear that the Yuboku Valley (near Svindlandfjellet), that is holding the only lakes known in the region, would be valuable to be included. That valley is well protected from the wind and appears warmer than the surrounding region. Abundant black and red cyanobacterial communities were visible in and near the lakes (Fig. 2A). 
    1. Outstanding values of the proposed area in light of the provisions of the Annex V
        1.1.  Biodiversity
The proposed sites hold a biodiversity representative of harsh mountainous ecosystems, at the limits of the physico-chemical conditions that enable life to occur. Its description is given below (point 8) and includes mosses, lichens, microalgae, cyanobacteria, microorganisms, fungi, invertebrates, seabirds (Fig. 2.A-F). The selected sites are representative of the natural biological terrestrial communities typical for inland Antarctic mountainous regions. One area also includes lakes that are very rare in this region. This type of ice-free high-altitude ecosystem is not yet well protected within the framework of Annex V. This was highlighted by Hughes et al. (2013, 2015) who stated that the new and sensitive molecular technologies were showing diverse microbial communities and endemic species in Antarctica. Future research using more and more sophisticated approaches will only be useful if there still exist pristine areas with representative terrestrial communities made of autochthonous taxa and protected from human impacts. The human impact on the region is still limited but a potential increase in traffic in the area in the future could underpin the need to protect pristine areas in this region.
        1.2.  Unique representativeness of mountainous ecosystems in ACBR6
There is another nunatak in the ACBR6 that includes a mountainous biotope, Svarthamaren (ASPA No.142) is quite small (7.5 km2) and holds the largest known seabird colony in the Antarctica. The Svarthamaren nunatak is thus impacted by the presence of the nesting birds and therefore, cannot serve as a reference site for natural, pristine biological terrestrial communities. In contrast, the proposed ASPA includes a limited population of birds (mostly on the Utsteinen Nunatak, see point 8). The second ASPA existing in ACBR6 is ASPA No.163 (Dakshin Gangotri Glacier) and includes a retreating glacier in the Schirmacher Oasis in a coastal zone. Thus, this area has very different  characteristics from the proposed ASPA in Western Sør Rondane Mountains and does not protect the same values.
        1.3.  Potential refuges for living organisms during the glaciation cycles in Antarctica
On the basis of isotope records obtained in quartz rich samples of Dronning Maud Land, Altmeyer et al. (2010) concluded that regional highest mountain peaks had risen above the ice surface at least 1-4 Ma ago and that actual levels of glaciation were reached ca 100 000 years ago. Thus, the inferred ice sheet elevations during the last glacial maximum appear sufficiently low to leave exposed rock formations that could act as potential refugia for the biodiversity. This explanation is presented by Czechowski et al. (2012) to explain the population distributions of tardigrades in Tanngarden and Brattnipane nunataks (Western SRM). As written by Stevens & d’Haese : « There is a greater need given the current and predicted environmental changes in Antarctica to have a greater understanding of the present biodiversity. By targeting sampling to potential refugia, we expect to contribute significantly to the understanding of how the current terrestrial biota relates to that of the past, and in turn how they may respond to future environmental change »
        1.4.  Scientific experimental value
Another value to be protected is the conduct of scientific experiments to characterize the impacts of climate modifications by the use of Open Top Chambers (Fig. 3). Open-Top Chambers to mimic future climate warming and its effect on the microbial communities were installed in 2010 on Utsteinen Ridge, Teltet Nunatak, Pingvinane Nunatak and Tanngarden Ridge. Additional ones (and their control sites) were placed on the Utsteinen Ridge, Teltet Nunatak and Perlebandet  in 2018.                       It is therefore important to protect these sites from human disturbances and trampling that would affect the results.
    2. Added-value of designating the area as an ASPA in light of existing management arrangements
There are currently no specific arrangements concerning the protection and management of environmental values in the vicinity of the Princess Elisabeth Station except through the provisions of the permit requested under Belgian law. The Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) of the season 2017-18 states that certain “no go” zones (plots 16 & 23, as defined by Ertz et al. 2014) on the Utsteinen Ridge were marked during BELARE 2006-2007 (see Final CEE 2006-2007 and Fig. 4). The role of these areas is considered to allow the microbiologists time to study lichen populations to ascertain if there was any endemic species of moss or lichen that were isolated in a micro-niche. Thus, this perceived role is too narrow in view of the environmental and scientific values to be protected, and the efficiency of the protection afforded by these ‘no go’ zones is unknown.
    3. Implications of an increase of activities in the area
An increased human impact can be expected in light of the activities of the PES, the blue ice runway at Perseus and the general trend of tourism in the Dronning Maud Land. It seems sound to create a protected area in the SRM to ensure the continuity of scientific research and the protection of the autochthonous biological communities. Due to outstanding and breath-taking landscape (Fig. 5), availability of mountain tops and nunataks that could be climbed, and the attractive wilderness of the region, it can be expected that it will attract tourists and sportsmen in search of thrills and adventures. For tourists looking for easier excursions, their visits would be concentrated in the few ice-free areas that are sheltered from the katabatic winds, and thus, the very same areas where the biological communities can grow. As these communities are slow-growing and fragile, disturbances and trampling may result in their destruction.
    4. Historical activities which could inform the identification of possible inviolate areas that may warrant further specific protection
The Sør Rondane Mountains were discovered in 1937 by a Norwegian expedition led by Lars Christensen. The stations installed in the region were the Base Roi Baudouin (1958–1967), situated at the coast in Breid Bay (Eastern Dronning Maud Land) on the ice shelf and Asuka Station (1986-1992) located at the foot of the SRM (Ertz et al. 2014). The SRM have mainly be studied during the last 60 years by geologists and glaciologists. Unfortunately, the only information concerning the places that were already visited are to be found in the field reports of the scientists. Other exploratory trips were and are probably performed informally. The location of inviolate areas has not yet been assessed but their potential inclusion in the proposed ASPA is planned at a next stage.
    5. Exclusion of ice-covered areas between the ice-free areas
The proposed ASPA consist only of disjoint ice-free sites, the ice-covered areas between the ice-free areas will be excluded from the protected zones. 
    6. Inclusion of the Utsteinen Ridge within the proposed area  
On the basis of the results of the field campaign of 2007 (see point 8), Dr Damien Ertz has divided the Utsteinen Ridge into 23 permanent plots (Fig. 4) to monitor future changes in lichen population and diversity, of which plots 17 to 21 are the most diverse and would deserve protection (Ertz et al. 2014). The Utsteinen Ridge is 700 m long, and the PES station is situated in plots 3-6 at the opposite extremity to the most diverse plots. In addition, 4 OTC and their control plots have been installed on the Utsteinen Ridge in 2010 and 2018. In 2017, the Belgian Polar Secretariat as responsible for the logistic activities of the PES station expressed some concerns about having an ASPA that would include a part of the Utsteinen Ridge as it would be close to the station, and could cause logistic problems. Therefore, the creation of an ASPA in the second part of the ridge is currently on hold. A potential solution could be the drafting of Site Guidelines that would ensure that all people entering this area would be informed of its biological values and of the scientific experiments in progress. 
    7. Possible risks associated with interactions between the station activities and the area
The 6 sites of the proposed ASPA sites are located at least 15-20 km from the station and are not connected to it. It is necessary to use skidoos or other vehicles to reach them. As discussed above, the second part of the Utsteinen Ridge (plots 17-23, Fig. 4) includes valuable biological communities that could be vulnerable as there is a physical connectivity to the station and it is very easy to walk on the ridge and enter this area. As mentioned above, the use of Site Guidelines could be further investigated to ensure that potential visitors to the station are aware of the values to protect whereas the station activities could be ensured.
    8. Presence of a petrel colony and of endemic microbes, invertebrates and lichens
        8.1. Petrel colony
As explained in the CEE (2006-2007), the evaluation of the number of petrel nests by                                 Dr Damien Ertz was very difficult due to the steep slopes. Most nests are hidden in deep cavities between big boulders of granite. He carried out therefore a transect from the base to the top of the eastern side of the Nunatak through the main part of the colony to count the nests, after which an extrapolation was made to evaluate the total number of nesting couples. In total, the snow petrel colony on the Nunatak is estimated as a minimum of 150 breeding pairs. In the field season 2017-18, Dr Henri Robert of the Royal Institute of Natural Sciences of Belgium has explored the region to carry out an estimation of identity and abundance of the seabirds, his results are not yet available but they will be taken into account in the draft management plan.
        8.2.  Lichens
Dr Ertz studied the lichen diversity on the Utsteinen Ridge and Nunatak, the Teltet Nunatak and the Ketelersbreen Dry Valley during the field mission of 2007, before the construction of the station. As stated in Ertz et al. (2014), the abundance of each species within each of the 23 plots on the Utsteinen Ridge was evaluated. Exhaustive lists of lichens were also completed for other parts of the Utsteinen Nunatak, Teltet Nunatak and a Dry Valley. Additionally, historic collections from the same area were revised. A total of twenty-three lichen species and two lichenicolous fungi was detected in the recent samples whereas the historic material yielded three additional species. These results raise the total number of known taxa for the SRM from 10 to 28, despite the small area investigated. Trapelia antarctica is described as new to science. Buellia bastini is synonymized with Buellia nelsonii and Lecidea autenboeri is synonymized with Carbonea vorticosa. The lichen flora of Utsteinen is made of a high percentage (48%) of Antarctic endemics. Lichens were abundantly present on the Utsteinen Ridge and the average richness was 10 species per plot, with a maximum of 18 species. Ertz et al. (2014) divided the Utsteinen Ridge into 23 permanent plots to monitor future changes in lichen populations and diversity and indicated that the plots 17 to 21 are the most diverse and would deserve protection.
        8.3.  Invertebrates
A study based on the use of 3 molecular taxonomic markers (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI), 18S rDNA (18S), and the wingless (Wg) gene) was carried out by Czechowski et al. (2012) on 126 individual tardigrades from four geographically isolated soil samples from two remote nunataks (Tanngarden and Brattnipane) in the SRM. Using these gene regions, they demonstrated that there are two taxonomically distinct tardigrades, or MOTUs. One MOTU belongs to the Macrobiotoidea, perhaps belonging to the genus Macrobiotus commonly found in Antarctica, whereas the second MOTU belongs to the Hypsibioidea and appears similar to the Antarctic endemic Acutuncus  antarcticus. The deep divergences in Wg and COI analyses between the SRM MOTUs and the other macrobiotid taxa from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic localities implies that species-level separation. The COI sequence divergence of ~23% indicated that the Tanngarden individuals have been isolated for a considerable period. In conclusion, the comparison of sequences from worldwide and Antarctic tardigrades indicated long-term survival and isolation over glacially dominated periods in ice-free habitats in the SRM. In addition, Tsujimoto et al. (2014) showed the presence of the tardigrade Hebesuncus ryani in a moss sample (Coscinodon lawianus) of the SRM. Czechowski et al. (2012) observed a dominance of  bdelloid rotifers in Tanngarden samples but those were not further studied.
        8.4.  Collembola
Stevens & D’Haese (2014) have determined that the molecular marker divergence (mtDNA COI and 16S)  in Cryptopygus sverdrupi collected in 6 different nunataks/ranges indicate that they have persisted throughout the Miocene and Pliocene in these glacial refugia. This first phylogeographic study on Cryptopygus sverdrupi from Dronning Maud Land showed a cryptic diversity and little mixing of haplotypes between nearby nunataks (up to 15 km distance), except for Pingvinane and Utsteinen that have similar populations. The unique haplotype present in Brattnipane, about 50 kms from the other sites, represents a distinct lineage and shows that geographic isolation is present. 
        8.5.  Microorganisms
The biogeographic studies of microorganisms are based on the sequencing of taxonomic molecular markers. The sequences are then compared with those included in public databases, like Genbank. Therefore, the determination of biogeographic patterns reflects the present state of knowledge of the diversity. The level of taxonomic resolution of the molecular markers is also important to detect the cryptic diversity that may be hidden behind the morphological simplicity of most microorganisms. The difficulty of macroscopic observations and the need to use complex molecular methods for their identification is hampering the appreciation of the importance and vulnerability of microbial communities (Hughes et al 2013; 2015). Puschkareva et al (in press) studied the cyanobacterial diversity in the control plots of the OTC and showed differences in cyanobacterial community composition which most probably were correlated to the substrate type (granite or gneiss) and physicochemical soil properties. Moreover, geographic separation might be an important factor in community structure, since each studied area was isolated and acted as an island with a distinct cyanobacterial community. However, Utsteinen and Pingvinane shared more OTUs between each other than with Tanngarden. This highlights the great spatial variation of microbial communities in this environment. Other studies of the molecular cyanobacterial diversity in the SRM showed a certain diversity of taxa of which 19 % appeared to be restricted to Antarctica (Fernandez-Carazo et al.2012, Obbels et al. 2016). A large-scale study by Obbels et al. (2016) produced a comprehensive inventory of the eukaryotic and bacterial community structure in a variety of habitats in the Northern part of the SRM. The habitats studied were microbial crusts, soil and gravel, endolithic communities, cryoconite holes, water lenses where the ice meets bedrock, benthic samples from a lake, water samples from melted supraglacial lake ice and epiphytic communities on mosses and lichens. Ciliates, amoeba, microalgae and mosses, fungi, flagellates and metazoa were present. Rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes and arthropods (Collembolla) were the main invertebrates. A striking feature in all the groups studied, except for the cyanobacteria, is the presence of a relatively large number of sequences with a similarity of less than 97% with known sequences stored in public databases. This genetic distinction maybe due to the fact that the taxa are novel and potentially endemic. However, it might be also linked to the incompleteness of the databases. Tytgat et al. (2016) studied the effects of bedrock type, the presence of vegetation, the concentration of inorganic and organic carbon, the electric conductivity, the moisture content, and the pH on the bacterial community structure and diversity in soils of the western part of the SRM. The 52 samples covered a broad range of environmental gradients from 9 nunatak regions situated on either gneiss or granite derived bedrock. Bedrock type, possibly in combination with (micro)climatic conditions, appeared to affect the presence of vegetation as evidenced by the higher abundance of lichens, mosses and algae on granite substrates compared with those on gneiss. Mosses, lichens and algae, often forming Biological Soil Crusts (BSC), are more abundant on granite substrates than gneiss. Moreover, bedrock type, likely in combination with its potential effect on the presence of macrobiota, exerts an influence on the bacterial communities in soils from the SRM. The communities in the (northern) nunataks differed substantially from those situated on similar bedrock samples in the main mountain range to the south. This suggests limited dispersal capacities, most likely in combination with microclimatic differences, as also noted in other areas from the Antarctic (see Chong, Pearce and Convey 2015 for a review). In conclusion, Acidobacteria (Chloracidobacteria) and Actinobacteria (Actinomycetales) dominated mineral soil samples situated on gneiss derived bedrock, while Proteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae), Cyanobacteria, Armatimonadetes and candidate division FBP-dominated soil samples with a high total organic carbon content that were mainly situated on granite derived bedrock. It follows that the structure of soil microbial communities in the SRM is mainly controlled by (i) the availability of moisture and TOC, which is related to the presence of mosses or lichens, and (ii) bedrock type, and related to this weathering rates and substrate stability. Other detailed studies of the bacterial diversity of samples were carried out by isolation and characterization of the bacteria and revealed a large diversity of phyla (Peeters et al. 2011,Tahon.et al 2016a,b; 2017b ; Tahon & Willems 2017) . Notably, the first cultivated representative of the bacterial candidate phylum FBP, Abditibacterium utsteinense sp. nov. was isolated from a soil sample of the Utsteinen Ridge (Tahon et al. 2017a).
