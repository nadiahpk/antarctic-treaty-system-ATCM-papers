Brazilian XXXVI Antarctic Operation









Brazilian XXXVI Antarctic Operation


Brazil's XXXVI Antarctic Operation (OPERANTAR XXXVI) was conducted from October 2017 to April 2018. The Brazilian Polar Ship "Almirante Maximiano" and the Brazilian Oceanographic Support Ship "Ary Rongel" were deployed from the port of Rio de Janeiro to Antarctica, with stops at Rio Grande (Brazil), Punta Arenas (Chile), Ushuaia (Argentina) and Montevideo (Uruguay). The operation supported field activities for 24 scientific research projects involving 260 researchers, specialized in areas such as oceanography, glaciology, geology and climate change. Activities were conducted on board the Brazilian vessels, in the Antarctic Emergency Modules at the Brazilian base and on various camping locations. Research activities were also carried out in other Antarctic stations in cooperation with the Antarctic Programs of other Contracting Parties, while the Brazilian Antarctic Program also provided field support to other countries' activities.

Deployment to Antarctica was preceded in July and August 2017 by a pre-Antarctic safety training course, which also assesses participants' adaptability and physical condition. Training is open to participants from all ATS countries.
