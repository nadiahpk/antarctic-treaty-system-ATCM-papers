Preliminary Survey for the International Exploration Programme of Subglacial Lakes in Southern Vitoria Land, Antarctica
Information paper submitted by the Republic of Korea
Introduction
Almost 380 subglacial lakes are known to exist in Antarctica (Wright and Siegert 2012). Due to their unique history, Antarctic subglacial lakes have been attracting a great deal of attention from Antarctic scientists. The lakes may contain unique forms of microbial life adapted to these special habitats, and their sediment holds records of the paleoenvironment. The Russian Federation has explored the largest subglacial lake Vostok up until the 2014/15 season (ATCM XXXVIII IP67). The United States has drilled the Whillans Ice Stream using the hot water drilling technique (Priscu et al 2013). The United Kingdom proposed the exploration of the subglacial Lake Ellsworth and tried to gain access to the lake using the hot water drilling during the 2012/13 season (ATCM XXXV IP30). 
The Republic of Korea inaugurated the Jang Bogo Station at Terra Nova Bay in 2014 to support national and international multidisciplinary scientific research programs operating in Victoria Land. As a major part of the Korean Antarctic Research Program conducted at the Jang Bogo Station, an international exploration programme of subglacial lakes in Southern Victoria Land has been planned since 2015. Our exploration programme of subglacial lakes will offer an opportunity to gain valuable samples and measurements that will be useful to address outstanding scientific issues in Antarctica.
The proposed lakes are located upstream of the David Glacier in Southern Victoria Land, East Antarctica, and have been selected by satellite studies performed between 2014 and 2016.
Programme description
This programme aims to characterize microbial communities’ adaptation strategies and evolution in dark and cold subglacial aquatic environments, in order to understand hydrological conditions and biogeochemical cycles, and to reconstruct evolution and paleoenvironmental history of subglacial lakes. The programme will involve accessing subglacial lakes using a hot water drill which will be developed through the cooperation of the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. Sampling probes, measurement equipment and sediment corer will be deployed to the borehole. This programme is composed of three steps: the first step will focus on preparing the CEE, including the hot water drill equipment and probe developing and testing. The second step will include the field camp installation and hot water drilling of subglacial lakes. Sampling probes and other scientific equipment will be deployed. Data analysis will commence in the third step. Hot water drilling and in situ measurements are planned during the 2021/2022 season.

Activities in the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons
The activity began in the 2016/17 season. An Airborne Ice Penetrating Radar (IPR) survey was conducted by a helicopter for 120 hours by 10 km grids to find suitable subglacial lakes to explore around upper stream of David Glacier (250 km x 200 km area around 75°36' 22.89"S, 156°3' 17.42"E). An Automatic weather station (KAWS5) was installed at the survey area. We maintained ten GPSs locations and obtained data on the bed elevation and ice thickness around the area. We found two potential candidates (about 3 km x 2 km) during the season.

During the 2017/18 austral summer, traverse to the candidates and preliminary survey were conducted from 24 October to 4 December 2017 (Figure 1). The traverse fleet was composed of two Pisten Bullys, one Challenger tractor, one caravan, a 20ft container sled and one fuel tank (12,000l). A temporary camp for six personnel was installed and removed repeatedly on the ca. 300 km traverse route (Korean Route). In order to obtain data for the identification of initial environmental status of the area, we collected snow and 10 m depth of firn core samplings every 100 km interval on the route to the proposed sites (Figure 2). Due to time constraints and severe weather condition, we were unable to carry out the planned ground base IPR survey.
In order to minimize the environmental impact, the mitigation measures were fulfilled throughout the period complying with the Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) document for the scientific and logistic field activities that had been endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in September 2017.

Next step
During the 2018/19 season, geophysical investigations of the proposed lakes will be completed. This will include a radio echo sounding survey, a seismic survey of the lake floor, and the collection and analysis of sediments. Baseline data for the preparation of the CEE will be obtained until the 2019/20 season at the latest. The preliminary analysis of microbiota and geochemistry of the overlaying ice will be conducted as well.
