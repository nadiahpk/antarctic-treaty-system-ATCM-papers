Progress in the revision process of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 133, Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands
Submitted by Argentina and Chile

Summary
Argentina and Chile started the process of revising the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 133, Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, under the terms of Article 6.3 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Based on the results of the preliminary evaluation, it was determined that the Plan will require major changes, including changes in boundaries. Therefore, Argentina and Chile have decided to conduct an exhaustive action that will include on-site tasks and office analysis work.

Revision process 
As part of the process of revising the Management Plan for ASPA No. 133, Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, initiated in 2017, Argentina and Chile conducted the first preliminary review of the contents of the Management Plan, adopted under Measure 7 (2012), which included:

    • the general review of the contents of the current Management Plan and their comparison with applicable Antarctic Treaty regulations; 
    • contact with the main researchers who worked in the ASPA in recent years; 
    • search for updated bibliographic material;
    •  review of relevant post-visit reports; and
    • collection of information on visits by other Parties, through the information contained in the Antarctic Treaty Information Exchange System. 

This process led to the need to revise important parts of the Plan, particularly the following aspects:

    1. Update of geographic coordinates and boundaries: This ASPA has had the same boundaries since its original designation as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 14 in 1985, which, according to current standards and the Plan objectives, do not currently seem appropriate. In addition, according to its description, it includes a surrounding marine area. However, it was never submitted in previous revisions to CCAMLR. 

    2. Update of the natural characteristics: The information contained requires an update, and the current Plan does not contain bibliographic citations or sufficient reference material.

    3. Access to the area: Based on the values of the area, the guidelines for air access to the ASPA may need to be revised.

    4. Installation, modification or removal of structures: Current information seems to be insufficient with regard to the guidelines for the maintenance of the existing structures in the ASPA (beacons and shelter).

    5. Waste disposal: The current management of the shelter’s wastewater should be reviewed.

    6. Maps: The maps should be updated on the basis of the information to be collected, including boundaries, present values, structures, etc. 

    7. Lastly, it is necessary to incorporate information related to Environmental Domains, Biogeographical Regions and important bird areas, as well as updated references to Manuals and Guidelines that have been amended in the past five years. 


Steps to be taken
Argentina and Chile have already started the process of reviewing the Management Plan for ASPA No. 133 and plan to continue to do so together. The following tentative actions are planned for the following work stages, which may be modified as the revision progresses and which will also depend on logistical possibilities:

    • Continuation of exchanges with scientific personnel from Argentina and Chile working on projects in the ASPA. Eventually, contact with scientists from other National Programs who have worked in the ASPA over the last 5 years. 

    • Field work in the ASPA, for the measurement of environmental values to date and for the collection of further information required to re-evaluate boundaries. 

    • If it is concluded that it is necessary to maintain the marine area, work with personnel involved in CCAMLR. If the marine environment is excluded, this task will be eliminated.

    • Rework of the Management Plan and the Maps.

    • Submission as a joint WP between Argentina and Chile to the Committee for Environmental Protection once the revision is complete.
