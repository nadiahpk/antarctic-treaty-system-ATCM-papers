Gateways to Antarctica: facilitation of access to Antarctica for purposes of scientific and technical activities in the framework of the Antarctic Treaty
Information paper presented by Argentina
Summary
At ATCM XXXIX (Santiago, 2016) the Russian Federation presented el WP 39_rev1 “On “openness” of the gateway to the Antarctic” in which it alerted about problems which had been registered in obtaining transit visas by scientific or technical personnel on route to Antarctica through the ports of some of the “Gateway Cities”. In that same document, the Russian Federation called upon southern hemisphere countries with Antarctic gateways to assist in solving these types of situations. 

Some Antarctic Gateway states responded favorably to the request and declared they were willing to solve transit matters for National Antarctic Programmes, be it on a case by case basis or through appropriate specific legislation. 

At ATCM XL (Beijing, 2017), in response to the Russian Federation’s request, South Africa presented IP33 “Gateway Access: Transit Visa Developments in South Africa”, through which it informed that its Ministry of National Affairs had issued special legislation for “investigators, specialists and expedition teams traveling to and from Antarctica through Cape Town”, pointing out their firm commitment to facilitating access to Antarctica for scientific purposes. 

Additionally, at ATCM XL, the Argentine Republic announced that it was working on a new immigration instrument aimed at preventing and solving these types of situations. 
Developments
Echoing both the above-mentioned documents and the informal consultations received from third country institutions, different agencies of the Argentine government worked from the end of 2016 and throughout 2017 on a specific piece of legislation that would contemplate the situation of foreign scientific/technical personnel in transit to or from Antarctica, so as to assist in solving immigration problems that could arise. 

Consequently, the National Directorate for Immigrations (Dirección Nacional de Migraciones) in August 2017 issued a Disposition1 which creates a new type of transitory visa category2 which applies to foreigners in transit to/from Antarctica through Argentine ports or airports, for the purpose of undertaking scientific or technical activities linked to or sponsored by a National Antarctic Programme or official institutions of equivalent nature. 

In September of 2017, the Argentine consular network has been instructed as to the specific nature of the new immigration category, in the strict understanding that it is not applicable to individuals traveling to Antarctica as tourists.





Current Procedure
As a result of the procedure established by the new regulations, holders of passports that require a visa to enter Argentina may request this special visa3 at corresponding Argentine Embassies or Consulates, duly accrediting, by means of documentation issued by the appropriate National authority or institution, the scientific or technical activity to be undertaken in Antarctica. 

Holders of passports which do not require a visa to enter Argentina, upon entering the country, should declare before immigration authorities at the point of entry that they are not entering the country as tourists, but as scientific/technical personnel on route to Antarctica. The immigration authority may request additional supporting documentation for the activity to be undertaken in Antarctica, whereby it is advisable to have documentation issued by the corresponding National authority or institution which refers to such scientific or technical activity to take place in Antarctica. 

Therefore, in both cases, the transitory visa category will allow for a stay in Argentina of up to one year with multiple entry/exits.  

The Argentine Republic trusts that this initiative will help resolve the needs of scientists and technicians in transit to Antarctica through Argentina ports and airports.
