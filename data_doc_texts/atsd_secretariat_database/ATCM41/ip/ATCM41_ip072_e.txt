Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2017-2018 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM information on IAATO Operator Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines use. This information paper presents data collected by IAATO from IAATO Operator Post Visit Report Forms for the 2017-2018 season. No non-IAATO visits are included in this analysis.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found in ATCM XLI IP71 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2017/18 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2018/19 and on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).
Antarctic Peninsula traditional ship-borne tourism 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, which accounts for over 95% of all landed activity.  
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). As all traditional commercial ship-borne tourism with landings to the Peninsula during the 2017-18 season was conducted by IAATO Operators, it is believed that this information is representative of actual activity levels. 

Figure 1: Factor Change in Traditional Landing Ship-borne Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula 1989-2018.  
Comparing the 2017-18 season with the previous peak season of 2007-2008, the following trends are visible:
    • Since 2011-2012 there has been a recovery in the number of passengers taking part in traditional ship borne tourism to the Peninsula following the global recession in 2008. This growth has been variable, however the total number of passengers from ships making landings in the Antarctic Peninsula in 2017-18 (41,517) has surpassed the previous 2016-17 total (of 33,580). In part this is due to vessels being operated with higher passenger capacity, with all vessels benefiting from the current world economic strength and operating at near-full passenger capacity for the whole season. Additionally, visitor operations continue to expand into the ‘shoulder’ seasons, resulting in an increased number of voyages (see below). 
    • Following the previous decline in IAATO ships operating in the area, from 33 in 2007-08 to 20 in the 2011-12 season, there has been a steady increase, with 30 SOLAS passenger vessels making landings in the Peninsula in the 2017-18 season. Three new SOLAS vessels joined the IAATO fleet during the 2017-18 season - Island Sky, Ocean Atlantic, and Silver Cloud.  Island Sky operated as an IAATO Category 1 (13-200 passenger), whereas Ocean Atlantic and Silver Cloud can operate either as Category 1 or  Category 2 (201-500 passenger) vessels.  All three operated at near to maximum clients for each voyage.  
    • There has been an 13% increase in the number of voyages (from 236 in 2015-16, 253 in the 2016-17 season, and most recently 293 during the 2017-18 season).  The previous peak in 2007/08 totalled 247 voyages. This is likely reflective of the popularity of air/cruise tourism which negates the need for four to five days per voyage outside Antarctic Treaty waters to facilitate passenger turnarounds in Antarctica and accounts for the increase in the number of passengers, and the increase in the number of vessels. 
    • There was a 9% increase in the number of landings made from last season (2,427 to 2,679).  This is consistent with the increase in voyages.
    • There was a 16% increase in the number of landing sites used since last season (125 to 166). This is likely due to favourable ice conditions encountered south of the Lemaire Channel and south of the Antarctic Circle for the entirity of the 2017/18 season. 
Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Table 1 lists the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made, for the 2017-18 season. 
The top five sites (Goudier Island, Cuverville Island, Neko Harbour, Halfmoon Island and Whalers Bay) accounted for 25% of all passengers landed and 27% of landings made during the season. The top twenty most visited sites accounted for circa 68% of the landings, with the top 25 landing sites accounting for circa 75% of the landings. 
These percentages of activity at a small number of sites indicate the trend of landings concentrating at a few popular sites remains consistent. See also ATCM XXXIX IP 104 Patterns of Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula Region: A 20-year analysis.
All of the most-visited sites are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or National Program management through their proximity to stations. 
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula in the 2017-18 season. Landings occurred in the Antarctic Treaty Area from 28 October 2017 – 28 March 2018 (a total of 151 days); 13% less than the peak of 174 days in the 2007/08 season. (The extended season in 2007/08 was largely due to the operation of the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov making early season visits to emperor penguin colonies). As in previous seasons, there is variation in levels of activity; for example, in the peak season the highest number of landings made on any one day (02 January) was 46, while the lowest number in the same period was 16 landings (16 January). 
The core duration for visitation by ships was a 90 day period between early December to early March. Despite the increase in activites, on the basis of the full season dates only two sites (Goudier Island and Cuverville Island), received an average of more than one visit per day throughout the season.  An additional three sites (Neko Harbour, Whaler’s Bay and Half Moon Island) received an average of more than one visit per day during the core season.  All operations therefore remained well within individual site guideline visitation capacities.
Additional tourism statistics will be made available on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).


Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines 
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and an analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms.  Appendix 3 illustrates the total number of known landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met. 

Co-ordination between IAATO field staff remains very effective. Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates that the daily limits set in the site guidelines were honoured during the 2017-18 season. 
Conclusion
The information extracted from the ATCM Post Visit Reports shows that overall tourism levels have increased from the peak season of 2007-08, as highlighted in ATCM XL IP71 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2017/18 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2018/19 are likely to exceed these numbers during the 2018/19 season. The increase is not uniform however, with a few sites receiving the majority of the increase, and others seeing a decrease in activity. The pattern of concentrated increase is believed to be explained by the popularity of these sites for their reliable access and ease of visitor management.  The entry into the market of larger capacity vessels and the gradual increase in air/cruise tourism has also contributed. 
All of the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Program Management guidelines. 
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP and ATCM on its Operators’ activities. In addition, IAATO Operators remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
