Organisation of the meeting
Status of the Convention
4.	Australia, as Depository, reported that the status of the Convention had not changed during the last intersessional period. The Netherlands advised that it will start the process to request full membership of the Commission. 
Implementation and compliance
5. 	The Standing Committee on Implementation and Compliance (SCIC) included consideration of:
    • Renewal of an Arrangement to release CCAMLR VMS data to Marine Rescue Coordination Centres (MRCCs) in the event of a maritime emergency (SCIC Report, paragraph 77-78)
    • The Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp. (CDS) (paragraph 3.12-3.17), 
    • understanding illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing trends and activities (paragraph 3.51-3.60), and
    • the Commission’s System of Inspection (paragraph 3.2-3.11)

6. 	In adopting a CCAMLR Compliance Report for the 5th year the Commission considered a range of issues regarding the CCAMLR Compliance Evaluation Procedure (CCEP), including: the assigning of compliance statuses, particularly the interpretation of the compliance status categories; the procedures for determining further action required by a Member; the reaching of consensus, particularly regarding issues that involved individual Members; and the method by which to improve the Procedure. The Commission revised its conservation measure supporting the CCEP (paragraphs 3.22-3.50).
Administration and Finance
8. 	The Commission endorsed the advice and recommendations of the Standing Committee on Administration and Finance (SCAF), including supporting further work to examine revenue generating opportunities and further reduce costs to secure sustainable funding (paragraphs 4.1-4.11). 
9. 	The Commission approved the budget for 2018 and the forecast budget for 2019.
Report of the Scientific Committee
A more detailed report that focuses on the five issues of common interest to the CEP and SC-CAMLR, as identified in 2009 at the joint CEP–SC‑CAMLR Workshop in Baltimore, USA, will be presented to CEP-XXI by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee Chair, Dr Mark Belchier (United Kingdom)). Additional matters on which the Scientific Committee provided advice to the Commission at its last meeting included:
Krill resources
10.	The Commission considered the deliberations of the Scientific Committee on krill resources and noted that up to 19 September 2017 the total catch of krill reported was 237 342 tonnes of which 149 334 tonnes from Subarea 48.1. The Commission noted that Subarea 48.1 was closed on 10 July 2017 (paragraphs 5.3-5.8).
11.	Five Members notified for a total of 13 vessels for the 2017/18 season. 
Fish resources
12.	In 2016/17, 14 Members fished for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and/or D. mawsoni. Members also conducted research fishing for toothfish in closed areas. The reported total catch of D. eleginoides to 19 September 2017 was 8 389 tonnes and that of D. mawsoni was 4 341 tonnes. (paragraphs 5.9-5.48).
13.	In 2016/17, two Members, the UK and Australia, fished for mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). 
14.  	On the basis of advice from the Scientific Committee, the Commission adopted catch limits for CCAMLR fisheries, including fish and invertebrate by-cach, for 2017/18. The Commission also endorsed the advice of the Scientific Committee on catch limits in exploratory fisheries and for  fisheries related research (paragraphs 5.30 and 5.88-5.89).
15. 	The Commission further considered the discussion by the Scientific Committee on management of catch limits where many vessels were competing for a relatively small catch limit.  The Commission recognised that capacity management and systems of allocation are issues requiring further consideration by CCAMLR over time, and that there was a need to develop robust management advice to prevent over-catch from occurring (paragraph 5.39).
Incidental mortality of seabirds and marine mammals
15. 	 The Commission considered the discussion of the Scientific Committee in respect of the incidental mortality of seabirds and marine mammals, noting the extrapolated incidental mortality of 116 seabirds in all CCAMLR longline fisheries in 2017 was the second-lowest on record.
16.	The Commission endorsed the recommendation to include seabird mortalities not associated with fishing gear as a prospective topic of mutual interest with the CEP and ACAP (paragraphs 5.49-5.51).
Marine protected areas
17. 	The Commission noted the Scientific Committee’s discussions on MPA planning in the Antarctic Peninsula region MPA (Domain 1), Weddell Sea MPA (Domains 3 and 4) and progress on research and monitoring in respect of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf MPA (paragraphs 5.57-5.62) and the Ross Sea region MPA (paragraphs 5.53-5.69).
18. 	It was noted that, although the Commission had been unable to adopt the Research and Monitoring Plan for the Ross Sea region MPA the Scientific Committee had endorsed the RMP (SC‑CAMLR-XXXVI, paragraph 5.45). The Commission noted that the RS RMP was a living document and requested it be posted on the Commission’s website (paragraph 5.74).
19. 	The Scientific Committee noted the loss of a 5 800 km2 section of floating ice from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Subarea 48.5 on 12 July 2017. The Commission endorsed the Scientific Committee recommendation that the initial Stage 1 Special Area for Scientific Study, as provided for in conservation measure 24-04, should be extended to a Stage 2 Special Area. This was designated for a period of 10 years. The Commission recognised the scientific importance of this area, and welcomed plans for research to be undertaken in the coming seasons by the British Antarctic Survey (February/March 2018), the Alfred Wegener Institute (2018/19) and others (paragraphs 5.84-5.85). 
20. 	Australia, France and the EU submitted a formal proposal for a new conservation measure to establish an MPA in East Antarctica.  The Commission supported continued work on the proposal during the intersessional period (paragraphs 8.29-8.51).  
Capacity building 
21.	The Commission welcomed the advice from the Scientific Committee that two early career scientists, one from Italy and one from Brazil, were selected to receive a CCAMLR scientific scholarship in 2018 and 2019 (paragraphs 5.91-5.92).
Impacts of climate change
22.		The Commission considered approaches for enhancing consideration of the impact of climate change on the work of  CCAMLR noting the proposed Climate Change Response Work Program (CCRWP) included many activities that were already part of the five-year plan for the Scientific Committee (paragraph 7.1-7.2.
23. 	The Commission was unable to adopt the proposed CCRWP at CCAMLR-XXXVI but the Intersession Correspondence Group on Climate Change will continue to work under its existing terms of reference, as tasked by the Commission in 2015.
Conservation measures
24. 	The Commission’s consideration of revised and new conservation measures and resolutions, and related matters, is recorded in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2017/18 published in late 2017 (https://www.ccamlr.org/en/conservation-and-management/conservation-measures). 
Implementation of Convention objectives
Performance review
25.	The Commission, its subsidiary bodies and the Scientific Committee considered the Report of the Second Performance Review (PR2) Panel (https://www.ccamlr.org/en/document/publications/second-performance-review-ccamlr-%E2%80%93-final-report-panel). Key recommendations that received support at CCAMLR-XXXVI included continued efforts to examine revenue generation options and reduce costs, strengthen capacity building efforts, and to establish a Commission Bureau and a Scientific Committee Bureau.  The Scientific Committee, SCIC and SCAF were requested to annually review the status of consideration of recommendations relevant to each body and the Secretariat was tasked with recording the responses of the Commission and the Scientific Committee to the PR2 Report recommendation CCAMLR-XXXVI (paragraphs 2.6-2.12 and 9.2-9.34).  The report is available in the public domain from the Commission’s website (https://www.ccamlr.org/en/meetings/26).
Cooperation with the Antarctic Treaty System and international organisations
26. 	The Executive Secretary provided the Commission with a summary of relevant issues arising from ATCM XL.
27.  	The Commission was advised that a report from the SCAR Observer was presented to SC-CAMLR-XXXVI providing an update on SCAR’s extensive range of activities relevant to the work of the Scientific Committee and Commission, highlighting the effective engagement between SCAR and CCAMLR.
28. 	The Commission noted existing formal arrangements with the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP), the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) and the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO).  It encouraged on-going work to develop similar collaborative arrangements with the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Arrangement (SIOFA).
