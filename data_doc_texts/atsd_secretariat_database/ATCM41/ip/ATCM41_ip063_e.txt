Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in Ushuaia during the 2017/2018 Austral summer season 
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2017/2018 Austral summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. Also, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships. 
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic ship-borne tourism, concentrating more than 90% of the worldwide ship-borne Antarctic tourist activity.   

The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has contributed to facilitate Antarctic cruise ships operations through the port of Ushuaia. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend the frequency of their Antarctic operations during the tourist season.  

Regarding Antarctic ship-borne tourism that operates from the port of Ushuaia, we can make a clear distinction between different types of vessels, according to their activities in the Antarctic Peninsula area. On the one hand, vessels that make landings at various sites; and, on the other hand, vessels of a much larger size which only sail Antarctic waters without enabling landings. Moreover, a further distinction can be made when looking into the services the vessels require from the port of Ushuaia: those vessels that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American and Antarctic itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia’s port as their summer base of operations. Generally, in the latter case, operations carried out in Ushuaia involve passenger changeover, using the city’s airport, port and maritime services, as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist services. Finally, it should be noted that at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic tourist season, most vessels arrive to and/or depart from the port of Ushuaia, and engage in positioning voyages from or towards other destinations.

In order to present the status of tourist flows of visitors and vessels that, through Ushuaia’s port, visited Antarctica in the 2017/2018 season, data was collected from the ship’s dispatches1 provided to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Coast Guard), national competent authority to that effect. In some cases, this information was compared to the itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained from alternate consultations. The information from these sources is used to build a database for each Antarctic tourist season.

This document updates the data provided in similar papers presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings since 2009, providing information that may contribute to discussions related to the Antarctic tourism issue.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that operated through Ushuaia during the 2017/2018 Austral summer season 
The 2017/2018 tourist season started on October 10th when the MV Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions) set sail for Antarctica, and finished on March 31st with the same vessel arrival to the port of Ushuaia. There were a total of 256 voyages run by 32 vessels, including smaller ones like the SV Bark Europa and MY Cloudbreak, which were included in this report given the fact that they moored at Ushuaia’s commercial pier. December was the busiest month regarding the number of Antarctic voyages (28.13%), followed by January (See Figure 1).

During the 2017/2018 season, 43,000 visitors went to Antarctica, using Ushuaia as a connection port from and/or to the Antarctic territory. Three passenger categories can be identified: a) those that departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is, passengers who went through Ushuaia once, either on arrival or departure to Antarctica- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports (See Table 1). In the first case (a), only the departure of the vessels was considered in order to count the passengers. In the second case (b), both the passengers who arrived at, and the ones who departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account, because several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, either combining with other means of transport such as flight-cruise, or visited Antarctica as part of the start and/or end of season voyage, operating locally (in Ushuaia) during the rest of the season. Finally, the last case (c) refers to vessels in transit, with passengers that were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the case when calling at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors traveled in tourist vessels of different sizes. In this regard, a distinction was made, according to the provisions of Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, between vessels that transported 500 passengers or less, and those that transported more than 500 passengers. Therefore, three (3) vessels carried more than 500 passengers completing five (5) trips in total and transporting 7,018 passengers, representing 16.32% of the passengers that visited Antarctica.

The average number of crewmembers and passengers,2 as well as the number of voyages per vessel is presented in Table 2. Figure 2 shows passenger averages per vessel.

Among the vessels in transit in Ushuaia, those that sailed through Antarctic waters without disembarking in Antarctica are noteworthy. As previously stated, these cruise ships completed itineraries around the southern parts of South America, or were involved in more extensive voyages and, on certain itineraries, they included navigating in waters close to the Antarctic Peninsula. Most of these vessels run “pendular” trips along Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3 provides an overview of the vessels that transported more than 500 passengers per trip, highlighting if the visit to Antarctica was before or after the port call in Ushuaia.

Furthermore, 22 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account for 68.75 % of the total number of vessels that were analyzed. Each of these vessels made between 7 and 14 voyages to Antarctica, as indicated in Figure 3. 

It is worth noting that the MV Ocean Nova, MV Polar Pioneer, MV Ocean Adventurer, MV Akademik Sergey Vavilov, MV Hebridean Sky, Island Sky and Akademik Ioffe, operated differently than the rest of the vessels, as they did so directly from King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo), South Shetland Islands (Islas Shetland del Sur), embarking passengers that flew in and out from Punta Arenas (Chile) in the months of December, January and February.

Regarding visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers were noted. Indeed, more than 84 nationalities were identified, with most of the passengers being from the United States, followed by China, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Japan and Argentina, among others. Percentages of the main nationalities are represented in Figure 4, where a total of 20 nationalities account for the 95% of all visitors.

According to Measure 15 (2009), adopted at the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one guide every 20 passengers, expedition staff members included on the crew and/or on the passenger lists, have been identified. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, expedition staff members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the landing activities. The only trips considered here have been the ones made by vessels that carry 500 passengers or less. In most voyages, expedition staff is included in the passenger manifest, followed by the crew manifest (See Table 4). It is worth mentioning that the expedition staff position is stated only when they are so listed on the crew manifest.

Concluding remarks
From the gathered data, it has been possible to elaborate statistic information allowing the identification of the vessels that operated in Antarctica using the port of Ushuaia, during the 2017/2018 season, the number of trips made, the amount of passengers and their nationalities, the average of crew members per vessel, the expedition staff and the countries where the ships are registered.
There are moderate variations observed when compared to the previous season. The number of passengers that have visited Antarctica through Ushuaia shows an increase of 6.57%, going from 40,349 during the 2016/2017 season, to 43,000 during the 2017/2018 season, distributed in 256 voyages made by 32 vessels. The number of voyages made by large vessels that only navigate Antarctic waters has decreased to five (5) trips made by three (3) vessels, transporting 7,018 passengers; showing 17.62% less passengers than the previous season. 
The data herein presented is a source of information that aims to contribute, as alternative and supplementary data to currently available sources, in the assessment of tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with special emphasis on those tourist vessels that call at the port of Ushuaia.
