Future Antarctic Science Challenges
Progress Report on Informal Intersessional Discussions on future Antarctic science challenges
Information paper submitted by Australia
Background
Since 2013 the ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (MYSWP) has included a priority:
‘to share and discuss strategic science priorities in order to identify and pursue opportunities for collaboration as well as capacity building in science, particularly in relation to climate change’.
To advance this priority, the United Kingdom proposed a dedicated agenda item for ATCM XL on ‘Future Antarctic Science Challenges’. The Meeting considered WP 1 Future Antarctic Science Challenges – A UK Perspective (United Kingdom), WP 30 International cooperation to advance shared Antarctic science objectives (Australia) and a number of other relevant papers. Several Parties reported that their National Antarctic Programs had developed, or were in the process of developing, strategic scientific plans for their research work in Antarctica. There was broad agreement that information sharing on Antarctic science priorities, and collaboration on science programs, should continue in the future. Several Parties recognised the value of work done by SCAR and COMNAP, and highlighted the importance of finding the best ways to bring science into the ATCM Forum, rather than duplicating processes. The Meeting welcomed Australia’s offer to lead an informal intersessional group to discuss the topic of Future Antarctic Science Challenges, and the ATCM updated the MYSWP accordingly (Decision 7 (2017)).  
Conduct of the informal discussions
Australia initiated the informal discussion on 6 October 2017, through an email inviting participation by all Parties, Observers and Experts. Participants included:  Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Romania, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and ASOC.
During the 2017/18 intersessional period there were three rounds of informal discussions.
In round one, participants supported the proposed work plan and objectives for the intersessional discussion. The agreed broad objectives were to advance the priority identified in the MYSWP by:
    • discussing Parties strategic science plans/priorities
    • Identifying any areas of mutual scientific interests  
    • considering any opportunities for collaboration and
    • reporting to ATCM XLI.
The purpose of round two was to collect information regarding Parties’ national Antarctic science plans/priorities, to provide a basis for identifying matters of mutual interest, and opportunities for collaboration. Participants were invited to complete a standard form that sought input on national Antarctic science plans and priorities, and information on collaboration between Parties to address shared objectives at the strategic level. Responses were received from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Romania, Ukraine and ASOC. For the information of participants, Australia circulated compilations of: ATCM Resolutions on scientific research and cooperation; and recent ATCM papers outlining Parties’ strategic science priorities. Australia also drew participants’ attention to the SCAR Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Horizon Scan and the discussions held at CEP XX developing a list of the Committee’s science needs.
In the third round, Australia circulated a compilation of responses received in round two, plus a preliminary analysis of apparent common fields of scientific interest. In addition, participants were invited to contribute to a compilation of existing major international science projects / programs.
Status of discussions
The informal discussions have already promoted a useful exchange of information on Antarctic science objectives, key research questions, geographic areas of focus, and existing international collaboration. A preliminary analysis of the responses shows that there are a number of broadly shared high-level Antarctic scientific priorities (Attachment A). It is expected that more detailed analyses will be possible in the next intersessional period, hopefully also to incorporate information from additional participants, with a view to advancing the priority identified in the Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan ‘to share and discuss strategic science priorities in order to identify and pursue opportunities for collaboration as well as capacity building in science, particularly in relation to climate change’. 
It has also been noted during the informal discussions that there are other processes relevant to the Parties’ discussions under this priority, including the CEP’s work to identify and promote the science needed to better understand and address the environmental challenges facing Antarctica, and the SCAR Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Horizon Scan and related COMNAP Antarctic Roadmap Challenge project.
Australia has prepared a working document containing the information compiled during the first period of informal discussions, and we would be pleased to share that document with any interested Parties.
Next steps
Noting that the modified agenda for ATCM XLI will not allow for substantive discussion on science matters, Australia intends to continue the informal discussion through the next intersessional period and to provide a report for consideration at ATCM XLII.
To maximise the benefits of the exchange of information, and to ensure that the outcomes of the intersessional discussion are as robust and valuable as possible, Australia warmly invites all Parties, Observers and Experts to engage in these important discussions during the next year.


Attachment A: High Level Assessment of Antarctic Scientific Interests
These informal discussions have already promoted a useful exchange of information on Antarctic science objectives, key research questions, geographic areas of focus, and existing international collaboration. This preliminary analysis of responses identifies a number of broadly shared high-level Antarctic scientific priorities, including:
    • Antarctica’s role in global climate systems 
    • Climate change 
    • Antarctic ecosystems – biodiversity, vulnerability, change, conservation, evolution, adaptation
    • Cryospheric research – ice sheet flow, evolution, sea level rise, role of cryosphere in global systems
    • Geospace/Upper atmospheric sciences- space and atmospheric physics, astronomy, space weather
    • Physical and chemical oceanography – circulation, ocean-atmosphere interactions, ocean acidification and sea ice
    • Geology and geological history
    • Environmental protection and impact of human activities– vulnerability, sensitivity to change, spatial protection, methods to minimise and remediate impacts, science to inform decision making.
