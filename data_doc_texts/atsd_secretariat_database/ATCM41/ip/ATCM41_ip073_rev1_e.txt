Statement by the Secretariat for the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP)

Distinguished delegates to ATCM XLI,
The Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) is a Multilateral Agreement that seeks to achieve a favourable conservation status for albatrosses and petrels, primarily by coordinating and undertaking international action to mitigate known threats to their populations. ACAP wants to take this opportunity to confirm the commitment to collaborate with the Antarctic Treaty - and related agreements - in the implementation of actions to improve the conservation status of species of interest and their habitats.
The Sixth Session of ACAP’s Meeting of the Parties was just held between 7 and 11 may in Skukuza, South Africa. This was the opportunity for ACAP Parties to review the progress achieved during the past triennium. Some of the advice generated and updated included the development and update of conservation guidelines on biosecurity, eradication of introduced species, surveys and sample collections, as well as advice on best practice to mitigate the incidental mortality of seabirds in fisheries. 
In pursuing the objective of the Agreement, ACAP Parties and the ACAP Secretariat seek to work in an integrated and synergistic manner with other international and national organisations with an interest in the conservation of albatrosses and petrels or the habitats and natural resources on which they depend. The Antarctic Treaty area is of particular significance to ACAP as nearly all of the species currently listed under ACAP either breed or forage in this area.  The importance of the Antarctic Treaty is actually recognised in the text of ACAP, and ACAP hopes that close, two way relationship with the Antarctic Treaty and related agreements will continue.
We wish ATCM and all Delegates a very successful meeting.
