2. Antarctic logistics
The logistic scheme of the activities of the Belarusian Antarctic Expedition (hereinafter - BAE) is based on close cooperation with the Russian Federation, as well as the prospective development of international cooperation with international logistics organizations and other Antarctic Treaty countries. As a rule, expedition personnel and the general cargo of the BAE are delivered to Antarctica (from Antarctica) on board the vessels of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (hereinafter - RAE) "Akademik Fyodorov" and " Akademik Tryoshnikov". The main supply of the BAE with fuel and food is produced in Bremerhaven and Cape Town, the ports of call of expedition vessels of the RAE. In addition, since 2015, the BAE, in cooperation with the Antarctic Logistics Centre International (ALCI) in Cape Town, has been developing transport logistics in the Antarctic by organizing the air transportation of part of personnel and cargoes of the BAE both to and inside Antarctica.
Since 2007, the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus has annually formed research expeditions to the Antarctic. During the period from November 2017 to April 2018, the X Belarusian Antarctic Expedition was organized:
- on December 4, 2017, the avant-garde group of the BAE, consisting of 4 people, having performed air flights along the route Minsk-Cape Town- Novolazarevskaya runway - Princess Elizabeth runway - Seva runway - Molodyozhnaya runway, arrived at the BAE basing site at Mount Vechernaya on Enderby Land in East Antarctica;
- on December 14, 2017, on board the Russian vessel “Akademik Fyodorov”, the general cargo and the second group of the BAE personnel, consisting of 3 people, arrived at the BAE basing site in East Antarctica;
- on March 25, 2018, the BAE personnel were evacuated from the basing site in East Antarctica aboard the Russian vessel “Akademik Tryoshnikov” along the route: RAE station Novolazarevskaya-RAE station Bellingshausen-port Montevideo.
- on May 7, 2018, the BAE staff arrived in Minsk by an air flight from Montevideo.
- on June 6, 2018 on board the Russian vessel "Academician Treshnikov" expedition cargo and scientific instruments of the BAE will be delivered to the port of St. Petersburg.
