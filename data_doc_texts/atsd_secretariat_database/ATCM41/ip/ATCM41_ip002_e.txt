Future Antarctic Science Challenges – Ukrainian Perspective









Future Antarctic Science Challenges – 
Ukrainian Perspective

Background

    1. The United Kingdom proposed a new sub-item for the XL ATCM under the item 15 of the provisional agenda: Issues of science, scientific cooperation and assistance, the future of the problematic aspects of scientific activities in the Antarctic. The goal of the UK was to call on the Parties to discuss important problems of future research activities in the Antarctic, in particular, those giving practical conclusions for the ATCM. This appeal found the support among the parties: the ATCM XL presented the working notes by the UK "Future Antarctic Science Challenges – the UK Perspective", and by Australia "International cooperation to advance shared Antarctic science objectives", and also a number of Parties presented their national research programs. In order to maintain momentum in addressing priority areas for future research and international cooperation in these area, Australia invited Parties to consider initiating the intersessional work on the preparation of the report to facilitate further discussions during the XLI of the ATCM.
    2. The following tasks were proposed for the intersessional work:
    • information exchange on the objectives of the research activities of the Parties in the Antarctic based on the discussions at the XL ATCM;
    • identification of shared topics for the research activities of the Parties in the Antarctic;
    • where applicable, the identification of shared objectives for the research activities in the Antarctic, for which international cooperation can be beneficial.
    3. As a result of the XL ATCM, Australia acted as the pivot for the further intersessional work and encouraged other Parties to coordinate their work.
    4. Previously, the international community, recognizing the global importance of Antarctic research, undertook an unprecedented attempt to collectively identify the scientific issues of the highest priority that can be addressed solely through the study of the Antarctic Treaty area. In addition, the community determined what research is necessary to conduct in order to meet the objectives of the Antarctic science at the dawn of the 21st century. The first step was the first SCAR study, Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Horizon Scan, which had identified 80 top-priority research issues (see SCAR IP020, ATCM XXXVIII (2015)). The ARC project provided information on the required technologies, access, infrastructure, logistics, costs and levels of international cooperation (see COMNAP IP051, ATCM XXXIX (2016). The results of these two projects clearly define both research priorities for the Antarctic region and the requirements for their implementation. Based on the results of the SCAR project of Scanning the Scientific Horizon of the Antarctic, six scientific priorities were identified, among which 80 issues were distributed, namely:
    • determination of the detailed geograpy of the Antarctic atmosphere and the Southern Ocean;
    • understanding of how, where and why the ice cover loses its mass;
    • investigation on the Antarctic history;
    • wildlife studies and conservation in the Antarctic;
    • space research;
    • awareness and mitigation of the human impacts.
The listed priorities are closely connected, and thus some of the issues cover more than one priority. Due to the shared consideration of the priorities, there are wide opportunities for obtaining the data of global significance.

5. 	This working note is a response of Ukraine to the call for an intersessional discussion, and represents the vision of future research activity and its problems in the Antarctic by Ukraine.


Research priorities within the framework of the Antarctic Program of Ukraine

    6. In Antarctic studies, Ukraine follows the State Program of Research in the Antarctic for 2011-2020. The program includes the following areas:
    • geological and geophysical research;
    • hydrometeorological research;
    • oceanographic research;
    • space studies;
    • biological research;
    • human health and physiology studies;
    • development and introduction of new technologies.

    7. At present, the project envisaged by the Program for 2011-2020 are in progress. Also, the preliminary analysis of the Program results has been started by Ukraine, and a broad discussion of the priorities for the next State program of research in the Antarctic for the years 2021-2030 has been initiated.

    8. Developing the State Program for 2021-2030, Ukraine takes into account and draws the attention of the Parties to the need of matching the areas of fundamental and, essentially, applied research in the Antarctic to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to the biodiversity goals set in a Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

    9. In this regard, Ukraine notes with satisfaction that the share of applied environmental research  in the practice of many Parties has significantly increased in recent years, in particular, for the establishment of marine Specially Managed Areas and marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean. Ukraine welcomes this trend and expresses interest in cooperation with other Parties in this direction.

    10. The main research priorities of Ukraine in the Antarctic currently are and will remain in the decade 2021-2030 as follows:

    • understanding of the current environmental changes, especially the climate change and further ecosystem changes caused by the climate change; modeling of the Antarctic systems and projecting their role in the global climate and biosphere. Within the research framework in this area, Ukraine especially draws attention to:
    • the need for paleoreconstruction of the Antarctic climate and the ecosystems in previous eras, and comparison of the current data with these paleoreconstruction (especially considering recent studies in the Arctic, showing significant differences in the response of polar ecosystems to the temperature rise nowadays and in the foreseeable past);
    • the need for comparative studies of the processes in the Arctic and the Antarctic for understanding the global mechanism of atmosphere and climate changes;
    • the need for in-depth study of physical and chemical processes in the high layers of the atmosphere, in particular, processes affecting the ozone layer over the Antarctic;
    • the need for an in-depth study of the mechanisms of energy transfer in the ocean-atmosphere system, in particular, the mechanisms for the formation of cold oceanic water masses in the Antarctic that play an important role in the global oceanic thermohaline circulation, the further paths of these water masses and their heat and mass exchange with other water masses and atmosphere, the changes in thermohaline circulation due to the global and regional climate changes, and vice versa, the possible impact of changes in the Antarctic part of thermohaline cycle on global climatic processes;
    • the need for building predictive models for the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean ecosystems to anticipate their response under various scenarios of climate change.

    • understanding of what constitutes the "good environmental status" for the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean ecosystems, and understanding in what ways the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean ecosystems can be managed to sustain this status. Within the research framework in this area, Ukraine especially draws attention to:
    • the need to formulate and agree between the Parties on the clear criteria (descriptors) for the "good environmental status" for the ecosystems of the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic, at the same level of accuracy as it is currently being done for the  ecosystems in the European continent;
    • the need to identify and agree between the Parties on the specific indicators suitable for environmental monitoring on the basis of specified criteria (descriptors);
    • the need to develop and harmonize between the Parties a system of scientifically sound environmental indexes for the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic that allow to quantitatively estimate the deviation of the existing environmental status from the "good environmental status" defined by the Parties;
    • the need to establish the system of continuous environmental monitoring in the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic, supported by the Parties on a regular basis;
    • for completing the aforementioned task, the need of aggregation of the Parties’ experiences in establishing and sustaining national environmental monitoring systems, and selection of the best practices suitable for the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean conditions, followed by the harmonization of the practices for the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean monitoring by the Parties ;
    • the need to improve existing and develop new international open databases, including oceanographic databases and databases on the state of the environment;
    • the need for harmonization among the Parties of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean habitat classification for the purpose of accurate assessment of their geographical distribution and further maintaining the full diversity of polar marine and terrestrial habitats;
    • the need for development and implementation in the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic of the most modern and effective (including economic efficiency) monitoring methods, such as operational oceanography techniques (ferry-boxes, smart buoys and other systems that automate measurements and online-translation of observational data);
    • the need of addressing to the previously neglected problems, in particular, the occurrence of the organic pollutants of rising concern, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, etc., in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean, their environmental fate, transfer with water masses, persistence, and ways of degradation under the polar conditions;
    • the need for special attention to the problem of marine litter in polar waters, in particular, to the formation and accumulation of microplastics and its impact on living organisms of the Antarctic;
    • the need for a special study of the transfer of persistent organic and inorganic contaminants through the trophic webs of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean, their bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the tissues of living organisms, and the resulting effects on the biota and the ecosystem as a whole.

    • understanding Antarctic biodiversity and how the vital natural resources are sustained, how basic ecosystem functions and ecosystem goods are provided, developing ways to conserve marine biotic resources and maintain sustainable fishery. Within the research framework in this area, Ukraine especially draws attention to:
    • the need of building models of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean ecosystems that can quantitatively predict the response of the main food web elements, as well as the selected populations important for the ecosystem functioning and sustainable fishery, to the commercial exploitation of biotic resources of the Southern Ocean   under different scenarios, with sufficient accuracy for the purpose of policy-making;
    • the need of quantifying the ecosystem goods provided to the humankind by the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean ecosystems, and taking into account the costs of these ecosystem goods in assessing any possible human impacts in the Antarctic;
    • the need for the regular updates and timely provision of the data and the guidelines on the key species and ecosystems to ensure sustainable fishery management in the Southern Ocean;
    • the need of the development of quantitative models of the key species’ response to environmental changes, primarily climate change, and changes in the commercial exploitation of  bioresources;
    • the need for the development and the implementation of modern methods for assessing and monitoring the biological diversity in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean, in particular, the maximum implementation of automated methods for such monitoring (for example, flow cytometry for bacteria and phytoplankton), and DNA-based methods of analysis, primarily, analytical methods using DNA from the environment  (eDNA), and methods of metagenomic analysis.
    • in order to achieve the above-mentioned objective, the need for the development of the most complete databases of indicative DNA sequences (barcodes) of living organisms of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean;
    • the need of deepening our knowledge on the composition of the biological diversity of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean, especially filling the gaps in the data on microscopic eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea;
    • the need for completing the data on biological diversity with the information on the genetic diversity, including the research results on population genetics of commercial, mass and endangered species, as well as on the richness and diversity of the functional genes of microorganisms in polar ecosystems;
    • the need of significant broadening our knowledge on the roles of living organisms in the polar ecosystems functioning, particularly, of identifying regulatory links in these ecosystems, improving the existing knowledge about the roles of microeukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea in the matter and energy cycles in the ecosystems of the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean, and the regulatory role of viruses in these ecosystems;
    • the need of special attention to the study of extremophilic organisms and the unique adaptive mechanisms that allow their survival under the extreme Antarctic conditions;
    • a prominent outlook for the biotechnology development stemming from the studies of the unique genetic and biochemical diversity of polar (primarily extremophilic) organisms.

International scientific cooperation in the Antarctic

11. 	The Antarctic Treaty provides an effective basis for international scientific cooperation on this continent, since multinational scientific cooperation is vital for dealing with the biggest questions on the changes in the Antarctic and their consequences. Ukraine wholeheartedly welcomes cooperation at the international level and is looking forward to a significant expansion of such cooperation between Ukraine and other Parties in the near future. The current State Research Program in the Antarctic for 2011-2020 in Ukraine suggests that most of the research in the above-mentioned areas will be carried out in close cooperation of Ukrainian researchers with their counterparts from the Antarctic Treaty countries and from other countries, within the framework of international projects and consortia.

12. 	SCAR provides an effective discussion platform for the initiation, development and coordination of international research in the Antarctic. Where appropriate, or requested, SCAR presents advice on scientific matters to the Committee for Environmental Protection and the Antarctic Treaty System. The scientific priorities are determined at the meetings of SCAR delegates, which are held every two years. Ukraine welcomes the initiative of Australia to organize an intensive intersessional discussion by the Parties, apart from discussion at the meetings, for the joint development of research priorities and the formation of international research consortia.

Recommendations

13. 	Involved in the substantive discussion on the Future Antarctic Science Challenges, Ukraine first of all shares the desire previously declared by the UK to achieve two main goals:

    • First, encourages all Parties to provide information on their research priorities in the Antarctic over the next few years to enable identifying the aspects of interaction and new opportunities for joint work and cooperation in the field of logistics;
    • Secondly, to decide when and how the Meeting will receive and implement scientific recommendations, and discuss the feasibility of prioritizing the issues for the next few years, possibly based on the long-term strategic work plan.

14. 	Ukraine provides this document with the vision of research priorities for 2018-2030, declares readiness and willingness to participate in international research consortia in these areas, and encourages other Parties to cooperate.

15. 	Ukraine also expresses readiness and willingness to take part in the further discussion on the priority areas of research provided by other Parties, and will consider the proposals of other Parties on the formation of research consortia and cooperation for further research.
