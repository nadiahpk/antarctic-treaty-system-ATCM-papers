Summary
This paper details Ukraine’s approval of three measures adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM). Ukraine has now approved Measure 4 (2004), Measure 1 (2005) and Measure 15 (2009). The approval instrument was signed on 15 May 2014, and the depository government was notified through diplomatic channels. For the information of Parties, and in accordance with the Decision 5 (2015) to share information about legislation to support progress towards Annex VI of the Protocol becoming effective, Ukraine provides details for accessing copies of the legislation. 
Background 
Ukraine has approved three measures agreed by the ATCM, namely:

1. Measure 4 (2004) Insurance and contingency planning for tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area, adopted at the 27th ATCM in Cape Town on 4 June 2004;

2. Measure 1 (2005) Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Liability arising from environmental emergencies, adopted at the 28th ATCM in Stockholm on 17 June 2005; and,

3. Measure 15 (2009) Landing of persons from passenger vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area, adopted at the 32nd ATCM in Baltimore on 17 April 2009.  

Ukraine’s legislation to implement these measures, the Decision of the Government of Ukraine No. 441 On Implementation of the Measures approved by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, entered into force on 21 June 2017. Ukraine therefore has now formally approved the three Measures, in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 9 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The depositary government has been notified through diplomatic channels of this approval. In addition, this information has been already collated through the Permanent / National Relevant Legislation section of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES). Ukraine’s legislation can be found on the Ukrainian governmental legislation register (in Ukrainian language).1  

Ukraine’s legislative amendments implementing each of Measure 1 (2005), Measure 4 (2004), and Measure 15 (2009) will commence separately as each measure comes into force, that is, once all 28 Consultative Parties have approved them.

Ukraine would be pleased to provide further information to any interested Parties.
