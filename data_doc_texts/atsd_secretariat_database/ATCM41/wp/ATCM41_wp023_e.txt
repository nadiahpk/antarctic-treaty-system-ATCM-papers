Report of the intersessional open-ended contact group established to consider the draft CEE for the “Rothera Wharf Reconstruction and Coastal Stabilisation”
Working Paper submitted by Norway 

Summary
An intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) was established in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs to consider UK’s draft comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE) for “Rothera Wharf Reconstruction and Coastal Stabilisation”. On the basis of comments provided by participants, the ICG advises the CEP that the draft CEE is thorough, systematic, clear, well structured, and well presented, and largely and broadly conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection. The draft CEE identifies and discusses the majority of the impacts likely to be associated with the activity in an exemplary manner, but ICG participants have noted aspects relating to the identified impacts and mitigations measures and have suggested some potential additional impacts and/or mitigation measures. The ICG further advises that the conclusion that impacts of some activities within the project will have a greater than minor or transitory impact is adequately supported by the information contained within the draft CEE. The ICG suggests that if the United Kingdom decides to proceed with the proposed activity, there are some aspects for which the inclusion of additional information could strengthen the final CEE. 

    1. Background
On 12 January 2018 the United Kingdom notified the CEP Chair of the availability of the draft CEE for “Rothera Wharf Reconstruction and Coastal Stabilisation”. The draft CEE has been prepared by British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The full document can be downloaded from the website of BAS1 or on the CEP Workspace on the website of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty2. The contact point for the draft CEE is Clare Fothergill (clathe@bas.ac.uk). 

In accordance with the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs (Appendix 4 to the CEP X Final Report) the CEP Chair issued:
    • CEP Circular 4/CEP XXI (12 January 2018), which:
    • advised contact points of the availability of the draft CEE;
    • advised of the need to establish an open-ended intersessional contact group (ICG) to review the draft CEE;
    • proposed that I (Birgit Njåstad, Norway) convene the ICG;
    • proposed terms of reference for the ICG; and
    • invited CEP Members to comment on the proposed convener and/or terms of reference.
    • CEP Circular 7/CEP XXI (29 January 2018), which noted that no comments had been received on the proposed convener or terms of reference.
Terms of reference
The ICG addressed the following four standard terms of reference, drawn from the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs as adopted by CEP XX3:
    • the extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol; 
    • whether the CEE: i) has identified all the environmental impacts of the proposed activity; and ii) suggests appropriate methods of mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts 
    • whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document; and 
    • the clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
Method of operation
All ICG correspondence has been available to CEP Members and Observers via the CEP Discussion Forum. The English language version of the full draft CEE was posted to the Discussion Forum, together with English, French, Spanish and Russian versions of the Non-Technical Summary and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2016).
ICG participants were reminded by the CEP Chair and ICG convener of the CEP’s agreement that the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs do not detract from the right of any Party to the Protocol to raise an issue on a draft CEE at meetings of the CEP or at an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM).
The ICG commenced with an initial comment period from 1 February to 5 March 2018. The convener circulated a draft ICG report for comment on 15 March. In this Working Paper the final comments submitted by members have been addressed to the convenor’s best ability. 
    2. Summary of comments received from ICG participants
Comments were submitted to the ICG by six CEP Members (Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States) and one Observer (ASOC).  
The following sections summarizes overarching comments and observations, as well as matters of principles, raised by one or more ICG members during the review period. 
The detailed comments submitted by ICG members are highly relevant and useful and should be considered of interest to the proponent in their effort of finalizing the CEE. No effort has been made to compile these comments into a single document on the following basis:
    • Substantive (non-technical) issues that members have raised have been included in the summary of the Working Paper;
    • Compiling similar, but not the same comments, may lead to loss of nuances in comments
    • Proponents are more likely to find use in the individual comments rather than the compiled comments in their further work
The complete set of comments from ICG participants are available in full from the CEP Discussion Forum. 

    1. ToR 1: The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol
ICG participants considered that the draft CEE largely and broadly conforms to the formal requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol. Participants noted the comprehensiveness of the document and were encouraged by and highlighted the thoroughness gone in to the preparation of the draft CEE which in turn had secured this level of conformity. 
Participants commented favourably on several aspects of the draft CEE as well as the proposed activity, including:
    • The inclusion in the CEE assessment of support activities and related activities, which provides the reader and reviewer with a complete picture of the project scope;
    • The separate discussion and assessment of the proposed development of the new wharf on the one side and the coastal stabilization work on the other, providing the reader and reviewer with a clear understanding of scope and impacts of the two distinctly from each other; 
    • The description and assessment of environmental impacts of options that remain under consideration, giving the proponent a documented flexibility with regard to those decisions that still need to be taken with regard to project design; 
    • The large number of studies, surveys and analysis carried out and presented to ensure basis for appropriate assessment; 
    • The manner in which the proponent anticipates future works by drilling and quarrying more rock than needed within the framework of the proposed project, in order to avoid future extraction works that would entail additional negative impacts in the future; and
    • The plan to use a certification framework to guide environmental management of the construction activities, which the proponent is encouraged to describe more fully in the final CEE and share experience on the use of the framework with Parties in due course. 
Participants did identify some aspects for which additional information or clarification could usefully be provided in a final CEE to enhance its robustness, if the proponent decides to proceed with the proposed activity. In the following a summary of these comments are provided against the requirements of Annex I, Art. 3.2. For comments relating to Annex I, Art. 3.2 (c-e and g-h), see discussion under ToR 2.
Description of the proposed activity (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (a)): The ICG participants agreed that the various elements of the proposed project are comprehensively detailed and well presented.  ICG participants noted that the proponent could consider inter alia:
    • Including details on precautions to avoid non-native species risks associated with imported sand (proposed development 1 – Rothera Wharf);
    • Include a consideration of how the new wharf design will cope with potential/likely increase of impact damage by icebergs (proposed development 1 – Rothera Wharf);
    • Include some more detail on studies or tests describing the risk of importation of non-native species through rock fill, central to the fundamental decision to blast etc. locally rather than import;
    • Including a description of any effect the proposed support activities may have on water consumption and production, as well as sewage and grey water issues related to this activity, noting also that it seems  unfortunate that the treatment plant maintenance is scheduled to coincide with the construction period and questioning whether there could be room for reconsidering the timing of this maintenance work (support activities); and
    • Include some more information on how proposed activity might affect snow/ice in the area.

Possible alternatives to the activity (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (a)): Few comments were made by participants with regard to this aspect, but it was noted that alternatives are well described and sufficient information has been provided to demonstrate why the preferred option has been selected. It was, nevertheless noted that it could increase the transparency of the assessment process if the advantages, disadvantages and risks associated with each of the various alternatives and design options for the wharf (described in section 3.4) could be summarized in a table format. 
Description of the initial environment (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (b)): ICG participants note that this section is generally well structured and written, and have not made any specific substantial comments or recommendations on this aspect..
Consideration of cumulative impacts (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (f)): Although noting that cumulative impacts have to a large degree been identified and discussed comprehensively and satisfactory, ICG participants nevertheless noted that further consideration could be given to i) cumulative impacts in light of broader potential large scale developments in or around Rothera Station and ii) potential increase in activity at Rothera by other players due to the anticipated high level standard of wharf structure.  
Consideration of the effects of the proposed activity on the conduct of scientific research and on other existing uses and values (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (i)): ICG participants noted that this aspect was substantially covered in the Draft CEE, but it was noted that the potential impact, if any, of any limitations on scientific research that may be imposed with regard to station access during the wharf rebuild could be more clearly addressed. Furthermore, it is suggested that consideration could be given to consolidating current descriptions relating to impacts on science in a summary section for ease of read.  
Identification of gap of knowledge (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (j)):  Few comments were made by participants with regard to this aspect, and generally speaking it is considered that this topic has been satisfactory covered by the proponent. 
A non-technical summary of the information provided (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (k)): The ICG participants highly commend the non-technical summary provided by the proponent in this document. It is very well presented, and easy to read and understand even for non-experts, as should be the purpose of such a summary. 

    2. ToR 2: Whether the CEE i) has identified all the environmental impacts of the proposed activity and ii) suggests appropriate methods of mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts

Impacts: The ICG participants concludes unanimously that the proponent in the draft CEE has in a structured and transparent manner identified and discussed the majority of the impacts likely to be associated with the activity. Furthermore, where impacts are accepted and deemed unavoidable, this has been clearly stated. The methodology used for the assessment is consistent with the advice in the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2016) and in line to current state-of-the-art and knowledge. Participants nevertheless raised some issues which would benefit from additional attention when preparing the final version of the CEE:
Methodology and structure
    • The methods and data used to forecast impacts are not detailed, and the document could be strengthened by including a description in this regard;  and
    • Make it clearer how and where potential impacts of support activities have been identified and assessed.
Impacts
    • The complexities and difficulties of assessing the impacts of underwater noise on marine fauna are well known, and the ICG highly appreciates the comprehensive effort of the proponent in assessing these important aspects of the planned project. The CEE addresses these potential impacts and plans for mitigating and limiting exemplary. Even so, it is noted that the proponent could, in order to strengthen the assessment even further, give further consideration to:
        ◦ Using a uniform mitigation zone for all marine species for blasting events on one hand and for rock breaking on the other;  
        ◦ Including and assessment of impacts of hearing on birds under water;
        ◦ Including an assessment of potential impacts on a number of whale species that are considered unlikely to frequent the area based, but for which current knowledge potentially is not sufficiently strong to rule out (periodic) presence;  and 
        ◦ Considering imposing time constrained implementation of potential high impact activities, avoiding these during the most vulnerable periods for affected species. 
    • The ICG participants have highlighted a few issues relating to impact of dust in addition to those already identified by the proponent, and suggest that further consideration could be given to:
        ◦ Considering risk of dust deposition in ASPA 129 and the impacts this might have on scientific work and monitoring in this protected area; and
        ◦ Considering potential impacts of dust on ice and snow cover in the area, and the ripple effects of this.
    • The ICG participants acknowledge the need for acquiring an additional sewage treatment plant to support increased personnel during project period, but suggest that in addition to already identified impacts due to this the proponent may want to identify increased fuel consumption and associated emissions as an impact of this. 
    • ICG participants notes the presence of a breeding colony of emperor in ASPA 107 (Emperor Island, Dion Island) in the region, and considering the swimming abilities and range of these birds wonder if it may not be appropriate of the proponent to consider including an assessment of potential impacts of the planned activities on this breeding colony. 

Mitigation: The ICG participants are in full agreement that the draft CEE considers, describes and prescribes mitigation measures that appear to be sufficient and suitable within the framework of the project. They furthermore note that these mitigation measures are thoroughly described, and the proponent is commended for having developed mitigation process and procedures as part of the CEE process, rather than indicating future work in this respect. The ICG participants note that clarification of some mitigation measures could be helpful, inter alia with regard to: 
    • Noting that fuel and fuel handling is one aspect with a number of potential impacts associated with it, consider:
        ◦ How the proponents will ensure personnel’s familiarity with spill kit contents and raining of personnel in use of the spill kits
        ◦ Clarify whether there is a dedicated refuelling space that would minimize risk of spill into water
    • Clarification as to whether biosecurity measures outlined in Appendix E also will be applied to equipment to be used in the marine environment; and
    • Consideration of whether there could be mitigation measures available for the loss of ice-free ground or to compensate for destroyed benthic habitat.


    3. Tor 3: Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document
ICG participants felt that the conclusion that “some activities within the project will have a greater than minor or transitory impact”, is clearly supported by the information contained within the draft CEE, and that this level of EIA therefore seems to have been appropriate for this project. 
The operational need for the project to be carried out is well articulated, and ICG participants also agreed that the level of impact can be considered acceptable considering the significant scientific and operational advantage gained by the project.  

    4. Tor 4: The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE
Participants were in full agreement that the draft CEE is thorough, systematic, clear and well structured, and commend the proponents for the effort put into the excellent presentation of the material. Small issues that were raised that could contribute to strengthening the final document include:
        ◦ Although the maps, diagrams and figures are very well presented and useful for visualisation purposes, some figures/charts/graphs are nevertheless somewhat unclear and some additional maps  (as specified in the individual inputs) could add value in certain instances;
        ◦ Consideration could be given to describe the impacts before the mitigation and monitoring discussion to ease the flow of thought and to pre-empt questions that arise with regard to appropriateness of suggested mitigation measures; 
        ◦ Consideration could be given to move the operational procedures provided in Section 6 into appendices for clarity and consistency; and 
        ◦ Consideration could be given to ensure further consistency in defining proposed activities, noting that in some sections of the CEE “quarrying, drilling and blasting” and “sourcing local rock” are treated as additional activities to the two main activities, ie. construction of wharf and coastal stabilization.
Note that further valuable detailed comments relating to format and structure are found in the individual input from ICG participants available on the CEP Discussion forum. The proponent is encouraged to use these as support in the process of finalizing the CEE. 

    3. Conclusions
Having reviewed the draft CEE prepared by the United Kingdom for the “Rothera Wharf Reconstruction and Coastal Stabilisation”, in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs, the ICG advises the CEP that:
    1) The draft CEE largely and broadly conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
    2) If the United Kingdom decides to proceed with the proposed activity, there are some aspects for which additional information or clarification could be provided in the final CEE to enhance its comprehensiveness, as outlined in this ICG report. In particular, and noting the considerable detail already provided on the impacts and mitigation associated with all aspects of the activity, the Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestions that some further consideration could be provided regarding:
    • a few additional aspects regarding impacts and mitigation relating to underwater noise; 
    • a few additional aspects regarding impacts and mitigation relating to dust; and 
    • cumulative impact relating to potential future activity and increased future traffic in the area. 
The United Kingdom is furthermore encouraged to consider the detailed comments provided by ICG participants as well as the summary of the main issues as put forward in the ICG report.  
    3) The information provided in the draft CEE support the conclusion that the impacts of some activities within the project will have a greater than minor or transitory impact”, and that this level of EIA has been appropriate for this project. 
    4) The draft CEE is thorough, systematic, clear, well structured, and well presented, although some minor adjustments could be considered to strengthen the document even further.
