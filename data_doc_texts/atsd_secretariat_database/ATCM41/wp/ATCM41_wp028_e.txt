Report of the Open-ended Intersessional Contact Group Established to Consider the Draft CEE for the
“Proposed Construction and Operation of a New Chinese Research Station, Victoria Land, Antarctica”

Working Paper submitted by the United States
Summary
An open-ended intersessional contact group (ICG) was established in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs (CEP X with subsequent amendments) to consider China’s draft comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE) for Proposed Construction and Operation of a New Chinese Research Station, Victoria Land, Antarctica. The ICG advised the CEP that the draft CEE is generally clear and well structured, but noted a few inconsistencies between sections of the CEE. Most participants felt that the draft CEE fully or generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection; however, some participants expressed the view that additional information would be required on a number of aspects of the activity for a final CEE to fully conform to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I. The ICG participants noted that while the impacts and mitigation measures related directly to station construction are well described, the impacts of other related activities would require further consideration and discussion. Participants agreed that the information contained in the draft CEE supports the proponent’s conclusion that the construction and operation of the new Chinese station is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment. The ICG suggested that should China decide to proceed with the proposed activity, there are some aspects for which the inclusion of additional information and clarification could strengthen the CEE.
1. Background

On 13 January 2017, China notified the CEP Chair of the availability of the draft CEE for Proposed Construction and Operation of a New Chinese Research Station, Victoria Land, Antarctica. The draft CEE was organized by the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA) and compiled by the Polar Research Institute of China and Tongji University.  The full document can be downloaded from the CAA website at  http://www.chinare.gov.cn/en/CEE2018/ The draft CEE can also be downloaded from the CEP Workspace on the website of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, as described in CEP Circular 5/CEP XXI. The contact point for the draft CEE is LONG Wei (chinare@caa.gov.cn).

The Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs adopted at CEP X, with later amendments, outline the process for the CEP’s consideration of draft CEEs. In accordance with those procedures, the CEP Chair issued:

    • CEP Circular 5/CEP XXI (13 January 2018), which:
        ◦ advised contact points of the availability of the draft CEE;
        ◦ advised of the need to establish an open-ended intersessional contact group (ICG) to review the draft CEE;
        ◦ proposed that Polly Penhale of the United States convene the ICG;
        ◦ proposed terms of reference for the ICG; and
        ◦ invited CEP Members to comment on the proposed convener and/or terms of reference.
    • CEP Circular 7/CEP XXI (30 January 2018), which noted that no comments had been received on the proposed convener or terms of reference.
Terms of Reference
The ICG addressed the following four standard terms of reference, drawn from the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of Draft CEEs, as adopted by CEP XX: 
    • the extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol; 
    • whether the CEE: (i) has identified all the environmental impacts of the proposed activity; and (ii) suggests appropriate methods of mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts: 
    • whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document; and 
    • the clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2016), provide guidance (relevant to authors and reviewers) on the presentation of CEEs. 

Method of Operation

All ICG correspondence has been available to CEP Members and Observers via the CEP Discussion Forum. The English language version of the full draft CEE was posted to the Discussion Forum, together with English, French, Spanish and Russian versions of the Non-Technical Summary and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2016).
ICG participants were reminded by the CEP Chair and ICG convener of the CEP’s agreement that the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs do not detract from the right of any Party to the Protocol to raise an issue on a draft CEE at meetings of the CEP or at an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM).
The ICG commenced with an initial comment period from 1 February to 15 March 2018. The convener circulated a draft ICG report for comment on 15 March. In this Working Paper, the final comments submitted by CEP Members and Observers have been addressed to the best ability of the convener. 

2. Summary of comments received from ICG participants
Comments were submitted to the ICG by eight CEP Members (Australia, France, Germany, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States) and one Observer (ASOC). 
The following sections summarize overall comments and observations raised by one or more ICG members during the review period. 
The detailed comments submitted by ICG members using the tabular comment sheet provide important information and should be considered of interest to the proponent in their effort to finalize the CEE. No effort has been made to compile these comments into a single document on the following basis:
    • Substantive (non-technical) issues that members have raised have been included in the summary of the Working Paper;
    • Compiling similar, but not the same comments, may lead to loss of nuance in comments; and
    • Proponents are more likely to find use in the individual comments rather than the compiled comments in their further work.
The complete set of comments from ICG participants are available in the CEP Discussion Forum. 
    1. ToR 1: The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol
ICG participants were not in full agreement on the extent to which the draft CEE conforms to the formal requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol. While most participants felt that the draft CEE fully or generally conformed to requirements, some participants expressed views that the draft either did not fully conform or only partially conformed to requirements. 
Participants, a number of whom commended China for updating its 2014 draft CEE, commented favourably on several aspects of the draft CEE, including:
    • a summary of the changes made following the previous draft CEE, including moving the site further away from the nearby penguin colony;
    • further information on planned scientific activities and on progress of plans for international cooperation with other Parties conducting activities in the region;
    • station design and construction plans, including prefabricated elements aimed to reduce the impacts of construction; 
    • further information on the buildings and operations in the proposed station proper;
    • plans for the use of renewable energy sources and efficiencies through building design, solar and photovoltaic systems, microgrid, energy management system, and phase change thermal storage; and
    • plans for a comprehensive treatment of sewage and grey water and plans for waste management.
In their reviews, participants identified a number of aspects for which additional information or clarification would be useful to include in a final CEE, if the proponent plans to proceed with the proposed activity. In the following, a summary of these comments is provided against the requirements of Annex I, Art. 3.2. For comments relating to Annex I, Art. 3.2 (c-e and g-h), see discussion under ToR 2.
Description of the proposed activity (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (a)): Questions and comments posed by participants were similar in nature and further information was requested on the following topics.
    • Fixed wing and helicopter operations, including a description and assessment of the ice field airport, support infrastructure, helicopter and aircraft fuel-use and fuel-related activities;
    • Logistics involving ships other than the R/V Xuelong, such as the cargo ship, landing ship, tugboat and rubber boats mentioned in the CEE;
    • Details on the construction materials selected for the project;
    • The collection (location and volume) and use of building sand/gravel/rock obtained from the surroundings (including impacts and mitigation measures in later sections of the CEE);
    • Emergency shelter location and evacuation plans, as well as the location of emergency generators, in case of emergency;
    • Projected water usage to include “other than personal use” such as for medical facilities, the greenhouse, science laboratories, mechanical workshops, etc.;
    • The construction plan for the wharf (including materials, installation methods, as well as alternatives and impacts and mitigation measures in later sections of the CEE);
    • Location, design, footprint and operation of wind and solar power installations;
    • Fuel operations, including further details on fuel transfers, fuel containers, fuel spill response and clean-up plans for both terrestrial and marine environments and a tabular presentation of estimated fuel usage; 
    • Technical information on the planned operation and management of wastes, including estimated composition and quantities;
    • Further technical details of the magnetic pyrolysis method for waste treatment, as it was unclear whether this method has proven viable in similar environmental conditions, and what alternatives are available; 
    • Water source during the construction period prior to the construction of the RO units
    • Information on what was contemplated in terms of the mentioned stations extensions, in terms of type and projected timetable; and
    • Further details on the management of organic and human wastewater, particularly in relation to dealing with “wet wastes” and to release of wastewater.

There were a few questions related to the assumption that some materials were pre-staged and some activities conducted prior to the projected first building season (2018-2019) and whether an IEE had been carried out for these activities. 
Possible alternatives to the activity (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (a)): Not all participants commented in detail on the treatment of alternatives. Recommendations for more detail included topics of what scientific information would be missed were the no-action alternative selected (given the number of stations with active research programs in the vicinity), how the alternative sites were selected and evaluated, how alternatives of the size of the station were analyzed, and whether alternatives to planned waste treatment (the magnetic pyrolysis furnace) and construction methods for the dock were considered.
Description of the initial environment (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (b)): ICG participants noted that the CEE would benefit from further details on:
    • Baseline conditions including a thorough treatment of the current distribution and abundance of terrestrial, freshwater and marine plant and animal species, including breeding grounds, gathering areas, and foraging areas of birds and marine mammals; 
    • The population status of all species of birds and marine mammals in the area, including breeding status;
    • Descriptions of the habitats of terrestrial (soil) invertebrates and microbes; and 
    • Descriptions of the nearshore marine pelagic and benthic communities which would be impacted by the construction of the dock.
Detailed participant comments and questions on the above broad categories are found in the individual contributions to the ICG. In addition, specific recommended improvements to the maps and figures in Chapter 4 were provided by participants.
Consideration of cumulative impacts (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (f)): Several participants recommended that the proponents address cumulative impacts resulting from the terrestrial as well as maritime activities of the German, Italian and Korean stations which are in closest proximity to the proposed Chinese station.
Identification of unavoidable impacts of the proposed activity (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (h)): This topic was considered underdeveloped in the CEE.
Consideration of the effects of the proposed activity on the conduct of scientific research and on other existing uses and values (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (i)): Participants expressed an interest for more information and concrete examples of international collaboration in science and research, including logistics arrangements, involving other Parties operating stations and research programs in the region. Clarification of what science would be conducted on-station and off-station as well as how the new research program would avoid duplication of effort was welcomed. There was some concern noted that the new station and its activities would negatively impact fauna and flora in the area. 
Identification of gaps of knowledge (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (j)): Several participants noted that the gaps described in the technical summary and those listed in Chapter 7 of the CEE were not consistent. Some participants expressed concern that at this stage of planning, the CEE noted uncertainty related to details of the actual design of the new station and they hoped that any changes to be made would be insignificant. 
A non-technical summary of the information provided (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (k)): Other than the inconsistency issue noted in the above paragraphs, some participants felt that more details on certain topics would be useful for those focusing only on this broad summary of the CEE. Such topics included the capacity of each renewable energy facility, the distribution and abundance of mosses and lichens, as well as non-penguin fauna and flora, and a topographic map. 
    2. ToR 2: Whether the CEE i) has identified all the environmental impacts of the proposed activity and ii) suggests appropriate methods of mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts
(i) Impacts: The ICG participants noted the main impacts related directly to station construction are well described; however, the impacts of other related activities require further consideration and discussion. These include:
    • Impacts of the full range of associated activities; including temporary structures to support construction, field installations, off-station science installation or activities, the windfarm, the helipad, the ice runway and associated facilities;
    • Impacts of the construction of the dock on the marine environment;
    • Impacts of the collection and movement of gravel, sand and/or soil required for construction projects, including the dock;
    • Impacts of noise on marine mammals (related to the dock construction) and on birds; and marine mammals for which distribution and abundance has not been described;
    • Impacts related to the potential introduction of non-native species (other than disease organisms), including the operation of the greenhouse and other activities which could bring non-native species to the area; and
    • Cumulative impacts arising from the construction of a new station in a region where a number of other stations and their logistical and scientific activities are located.
Participants recommended that further details be provided on methodologies used in the monitoring plan, including establishment of baselines, parameters to be measured, and monitoring techniques and analyses, both during the construction period and during operations in order to ensure that the impacts of the proposed activity can be verified and that any unforeseen impacts can be identified. In particular, specific questions arose as monitoring of sound in the ocean during dock construction, of dust generated during construction, of monitoring wildlife response, and monitoring of non-native species.
(ii) Mitigation:  The ICG participants noted that the CEE substantially addresses mitigation measures and recognized that the station design is environmentally efficient. However, participants noted that further information on the following topics should be provided, including:
    • Mitigation of impacts on fauna (other than penguins) and flora (including terrestrial vegetation and invertebrates) and on nearshore marine organisms;
    • Mitigation measures related to the potential introduction of non-native species;
    • Mitigation measures associated with the quarrying of rock and gravel for construction, which would impact the terrain and produce dust;
    • Mitigation measures associated with the windfarm, including construction and potential bird strikes ;
    • Mitigation measures associated with the placement and activities of the airfield; and
    • Mitigation measures associated with fuel activities.

It was mentioned that a fuller understanding of mitigation measures could be gained if various plans were included in the CEE, perhaps in an appendix, covering procedures for waste management, oil spill contingencies, environmental management, etc.

Of particular interest to a number of participants was the proposed ASPA. Information would be welcome on the following: the process by which a proposal would be developed, projected timing of a proposal, relationship to the Important Birds Areas (IBA) assessment of both penguin and skua populations, collaboration with other Parties in the regions, and plans to manage station personnel to avoid impact prior to the development of a management plan.

One participant suggested the establishment of a second ASPA in the immediate vicinity of the station to serve as a control site to facilitate environmental monitoring of impacts of the station and its activities.
    3. Tor 3: Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document
There were a range of comments on Section 8 “Conclusion”. ICG participants felt that the conclusion that the “construction and operation of the new station will have more than minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment” was supported by the content of the draft CEE. Some members expressed the view that the CEE did not demonstrate that the building of the station was completely essential to achieving the goals of regional research, while others felt that the scientific benefits would likely outweigh the environmental impacts.
    4. Tor 4: The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE
Participants generally agreed that the CEE is comprehensive, well-written, and logically organized. There were several regarding inconsistencies within the document which made understanding a bit difficult. A number of participants recommended the following for increasing increase clarity and information content:
    • Improvements in graphs and figures, especially in legends; 
    • Presentation of some of the technical material in the form of graphs; and
    • Inclusion of maps which include proposed locations for facilities other than the main station infrastructure, such as the airfield, field research sites, windfarm, etc.

3.  Conclusions 

The ICG established to consider the Draft CEE for the Proposed Construction and Operation of a New Chinese Research Station, Victoria Land, Antarctica advises the CEP, in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs, that:
    • The draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  
    • If China decides to proceed with the proposed activity, the final CEE could be strengthened through the inclusion of additional information and clarification on a number of aspects. In particular, the Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestions that further details could be provided regarding: 
        ◦ Description, impacts, and mitigation of the full range of activities associated with the building of the station proper, including: aircraft operations; the ice runway and associated facilities; construction of the proposed wharf; wind and solar power installations; scientific field installations and activities; sourcing and processing of local rock; marine noise; waste management; and fuel transport, handling, and storage; 
        ◦ Mitigation measures related to non-native species, fuel management and energy production, and potential disturbance and impact to both terrestrial and nearshore marine fauna and flora and nearby HSMs; and
        ◦ The potential for cumulative impacts of operational and scientific research activities in proximity to other national programs. 
    • China is encouraged to consider the detailed comments provided by ICG participants as well as the summary of the main issues summarized in the ICG report.
    • The information contained in the draft CEE supports the proponent’s conclusion that the construction and operation of Chinese station is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment. 
    • The draft CEE is generally clear, well structured, and well-presented although suggestions were made to further strengthen the document.
