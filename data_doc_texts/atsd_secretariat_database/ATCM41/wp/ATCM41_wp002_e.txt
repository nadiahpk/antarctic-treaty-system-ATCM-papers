Review of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) No. 137 Northwest White Island, McMurdo Sound, and No. 138 Linnaeus Terrace, Asgard Range, Victoria Land
Working Paper submitted by the United States
Background
The Management Plans for ASPA No. 137 Northwest White Island and ASPA No. 138 Linnaeus Terrace were last reviewed in 2013, and review of these sites under Annex V thus falls due in 2018. 

Review
Accordingly, the United States reviewed permits issued for visits to these Areas since the previous revision of the management plan and has also reviewed the Management Plans. Few visits to these sites have been made since the last Management Plan update, and no changes to the description of the Area or policies in the Management Plans were required. The exceptional values of these Areas remain valid, and the Management Plans continue to protect these values at the sites. As such, the United States recommends that special protection of ASPA No. 137 Northwest White Island and ASPA No. 138 Linnaeus Terrace continue, and that the Management Plans for these sites continue to remain in force without any changes.

Recommendation

The United States requests consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection to recommend to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting that adoption of the Management Plans for these sites be continued for an indefinite period and that the five-year period until the next review is due is reset.
