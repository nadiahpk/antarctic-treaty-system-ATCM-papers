Summary of findings and reflections on trends from the Inspections undertaken by Norway under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Environmental Protocol
Working paper submitted by Norway



    1. Introduction
 
Norway carried out its fifth inspection in Antarctica during the 2017-2018 season. The inspections were carried out in the period 9-17th February 2018. The 2018 Norwegian inspection covered 6 stations and installations in Dronning Maud Land and 1 station in Coats Land:

    • Princess Elisabeth Antarctic Research Station (Belgium)
    • Halley VI (United Kingdom)
    • Neumayer III (Germany)
    • Perseus Blue Ice Runway (ALCI Nord)
    • Novo Airbase and Airfield (ALCI and Russia)
    • SANAE IV (South Africa)
    • SANAP Summer Station (South Africa)


The Norwegian inspection team consisted of the following seven Norwegian nationals designated by the Norwegian Government in accordance with the notification procedures of Article VII(1) of the Antarctic Treaty:

    • Ambassador Anniken Ramberg Krutnes, Special Adviser for Polar Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    • Ms. Mette Strengehagen, Senior Adviser, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    • Mr. Øystein Mortensen, Director General, Ministry of Justice
    • Ms. Aud Ingvild Slettemoen, Director, Ministry of Climate and Environment
    • Dr. Nalân Koç, Research Director, Norwegian Polar Institute
    • Mr. John Guldahl, Director, Norwegian Polar Institute
    • Ms. Birgit Njåstad, Senior Environmental Policy Advisor, Norwegian Polar Institute

Logistical support for the inspections were arranged within the framework of the Norwegian national Antarctic program, by the Norwegian Polar Institute. The inspection team travelled by air from Cape Town to Troll Airfield, within the DROMLAN flight framework. A Basler DC-3T (operated by Ken Borek Air of Canada) was used to reach the 7 stations and installations where inspections were carried out.

The inspection team maintained focus on an overarching, rather than on a detailed, level during the inspection. The inspection team nevertheless used Inspection Checklist A as guidance in preparing for the inspection and for general approach during inspection.

All inspections were undertaken in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Environmental Protocol. The full inspection report is attached to this Working Paper.



    2. Summary of findings

Below is a summary of the main findings from the inspections. Details on findings from the individual stations and installations can be found in the attached inspection report. We have indicated those items that are of relevance for further reflection and discussion by the ATCM and/or the CEP respectively in brackets. 

    1. The inspection was carried out from 9-17 February 2018. Seven installations were inspected. Four of the installations were scientific research stations (Halley VI, Neumayer III, SANAE IV, and Princess Elisabeth Antarctica), one was a field station/logistical support base/e-base (SANAP summer station), whilst two installation provides support functions to inter alia national Antarctic programs (Novo Airbase & Airfield and Perseus Runway). 
    2. The inspection team was given complete freedom of access to all areas of the stations and installations visited. No weapons, military activity nor nuclear material or disposals were observed during the inspection at any of the installations. [ATCM]
    3. As far as the inspection team could discern, permits and authorisation were in place for and at all installations. [ATCM/CEP]
    4. As a general observation, the inspection team concluded that safety and emergency procedures and facilities at most installations seemed to be of satisfactory standard, although at two of the installations, improvements could be made (a lack of emergency shelter at one, and a shelter in bad condition at the other). [ATCM]
    5. Generally speaking, education, training, and operational procedures and formal documentation were in place for all station programs. This indicated familiarity with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, Environmental Protocol and related agreements by station personnel at inspected stations. [ATCM/CEP]
    6. There was a variety of organisational structures associated with the research stations, varying from the traditional clear governmental structure (Halley VI, Neumayer III and SANAE IV) to more mixed governmental/private structures (PEA). Mixed interests and ownerships also characterised the two support facilities inspected, ie. Novo Airbase and Airfield and Perseus Runway. [ATCM]
    7. All the inspected research stations have substantial research activities. They all have a mix of long-term observations series and short-term projects. The stations with a clear link to a national research program seem to have a larger focus on the long-term series than the station with no formal national program. All the stations provide vital data for a global understanding. The degree to which these observation programs are internationally coordinated and fed into global observing systems varies. [ATCM]
    8. Three of the research stations (Halley, Neumayer and PEA) are fairly new stations, and standard setting in their own ways, with regard to efficient and environmentally friendly operations. This is clearly coloured by the framework provided by inter alia the Environmental Protocol, which now has been in force for 20 years. SANAE IV, the only pre-Protocol station inspected, has invested substantially over the last few years to move toward that same kind of post-Protocol standard. As such, the inspection team notes that the framework, provisions and principles of the Environmental Protocol and the Treaty system seems to have had an overall positive impact on the conduct of national Antarctic operations. [CEP/ATCM]
    9. The inspection team noted that there is an ongoing shift towards more complex technological systems that to a much larger degree than before can be operated remotely. There is also an increased automatization of observation and monitoring instruments, which could potentially reduce required on-site activity over time. [ATCM/CEP]
    10. The inspection team observed a general and universal intent and desire by the inspected research stations to implement efficient and green technologies in their operations. There is, however, a marked difference between stations on how progressive they are with regard to energy production. All but one is still highly reliant on conventional energy sources. [CEP/ATCM]
    11. The inspection team noted that in some cases there was a lack of information on relevant contact points. This makes information sharing difficult and is also a serious concern in relation to emergency situations and SAR. [ATCM]
    12. The inspection team noted that there is increased activity in the inspected region. This is shown, by amongst other things, the establishment of new runways, and an increasing number of flights. [ATCM]


    3.  Reflections on trends

The inspection team reflected on the general developments and trends observed in Antarctica during the inspection. These reflections fall under four main headings. In this document, we present a  summary of the conclusions and recommendations from the report. The full discussion supporting these conclusions and recommendations can be found in Chapter 10 of the inspection report. We have indicated those items that are of relevance for further reflection and discussion by the ATCM and/or the CEP in brackets. 

        3.1 Scientific Activities
    • The 2018 Norwegian inspection team notes the importance of continuing the currently ongoing discussions in the ATCM on science priorities and directions in order to support the development of robust and globally important science contributions by Parties through their national programs. [ATCM]
    • The 2018 Norwegian inspection team notes that there could be merit in getting an overview and assessment of Antarctic observation efforts in order to enhance their use and robustness, as well as identifying gaps in observation needs. [ATCM]
    • The 2018 Norwegian inspection team notes that there is a potential for more exchange of information on technological solutions for research and observation efforts in Antarctica. [ATCM]

        3.2 Station technology and management

    • The 2018 Norwegian inspection team encourages continued implementation of innovative and green technologies at stations, and in that respect notes the need for a continued focus on exchanging information and best practices between national programs, operators and personnel at Antarctic stations. [CEP/ATCM]

        3.3 Operational responsibilities
    • The inspection team notes a continued shift toward more complex ownership structures and more independent operations in Dronning Maud Land and suggests that the ATCM might want to consider how such a development may impact core functions/established mechanisms and foras for cooperation. Furthermore, the inspection team suggests that all parties consider possible implications of these trends in their effort to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are carried out in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty and the Environmental Protocol. [ATCM]
    • Treaty Parties should be encouraged to consider the possibility of establishing routines/mechanisms to ensure the availability of relevant information about ownership and management structures for all operations in Antarctica, incl. also contact points, permit information etc. to all Treaty Parties and national programs. [ATCM]

        3.4 Implications of new and changing activity patterns
    • The inspection team notes that there is a need to look further into safety issues related to flight operations and the increasing air traffic in Dronning Maud Land, in particular in areas where multiple flight operations take place. [ATCM]
    • It is essential that further efforts are taken and mechanisms put in place to ensure an appropriate level of transparency and cooperation between all operations and operators in the Dronning Maud Land area to ensure that human and environmental risks are minimized. [ATCM]
    • The implications of SAR burdens on national program personnel due to increased activity and associated risks in various regions of Antarctica might be an issue that the Antarctic Treaty system, as well as national programs, should focus attention on. The inspection team underscores the importance of Parties ensuring that non-governmental operators under their jurisdiction has sufficient and appropriate search and rescue capabilities at hand to cover all aspects of their activities, and that they do not rely on national operator resources for this purpose, as eg. specified in Measure 4 (2004). [ATCM]
    • The 2018 Norwegian inspection team suggest that Parties continue to consider the use and understanding of the terms non-permanent, semi-permanent and permanent in light of the EIA provisions and requirements of the Environmental Protocol. [ATCM/CEP]  


    4. Conclusion

Norway submits to the attention of the ATCM and the CEP its report from the 2018 Norwegian Inspection and invites the ATCM and the CEP to consider its findings as summarized in this paper and detailed in the full report. We would ask that the ATCM show particular attention to those items we have indicated that the ATCM may have an interest in, and that the CEP consider those that we have indicated that the Committee may have a particular interest in.
