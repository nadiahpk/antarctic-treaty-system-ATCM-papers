An enhanced definition of Bioprospection in Antarctica

Working Paper submitted by Brazil

1. Introduction
The exploration of natural resources present in Antarctica is a complex subject. The overwhelming richness of Antarctic natural resources includes many different life forms, such as vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and different microorganisms. However, bioprospection and the potential biotechnological use of Antarctica organisms have been raised as an issue of concern by some countries such as France, New Zealand, Australia, Belgium, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Sweden in various ATCM meetings. According to Working Paper 36 proposed by Netherlands, Belgium, and France, presented at the XXX ATCM, biological prospecting was first discussed at ATCM XXV based on a working paper submitted by the United Kingdom.1
After that, other Working Papers were proposed on the issue of Antarctic Bioprospecting, such as:
    • ATCM XXXII WP18 Regulation of Biological Prospecting under the Antarctic Treaty System, proposed by Australia and New Zealand. It notes the comprehensiveness of existing Antarctic Treaty system arrangements for governing the conduct of scientific research and harvesting of marine living resources in the Antarctic region; ensures that all biological prospecting activity proposed by their nationals and national Antarctic programs is managed as an authorised activity under existing Antarctic Treaty system arrangements; acknowledges that existing Antarctic Treaty system arrangements are adequate to address the environmental aspects of biological prospecting in the Antarctic region; and continue to co-operate in strengthening the regulatory frameworks within the Antarctic Treaty System, as deemed necessary by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties.
    • ATCM XXXVI WP48 Biological prospecting in Antarctica – the need for improved information, proposed by Belgium, Netherlands, and Sweden. It was recommended that Governments report on biological prospecting activities under their jurisdiction in their Annual Exchange of Information, and requests that the Secretariat facilitate this in the Electronic Information Exchange System; and encourages Governments to promote the exchange of views at the national level to inform the ongoing discussions related to access to genetic resources in other international fora, particularly in the context of Article 10 of the Nagoya Protocol and in the United Nations Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to study issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction, on bioprospecting activities in Antarctica.
2. Brazilian Bioprospecting Activities in Antarctica
Brazil is known as one of the world's megadiverse nations. As a consequence, Universities and Research Centers have been studying Brazilian biodiversity as a potential source of biotechnological products for multiple uses, such as pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Over the last 10 years special attention has been devoted by the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) to studies about the biotechnological potential of Antarctic organisms, in line with efforts carried out by several other nations under the Treaty. Some examples include:
    • Antibiotics produced by Antarctic fungi with activities against tropical neglected diseases such as leishmaniosis, Chagas diseases, Dengue, Zika, and Yellow Fever virus, as well as antimicrobial compounds able to inhibit bacteria and fungi of clinical importance;
    • Fungi thought to be able to produce herbicides and antifungal, natural products for potential use in agriculture;
    • Antifreeze enzymes produced by bacteria, fungi, and fish;
    • Photoprotectives and antioxidant compounds produced by macroalgae;
    • Characterization of mosses and lichens with antibiotic activities;
    • Study of bacteria able to produce antibiotic and antioxidant activities;
    • Sequencing whole genome of fungi to search for genes with antifreeze properties, among others.
3. Summary of Proposal
Working Paper 12, presented by Belgium in ATCM XXXVII2, proposed the implementation of Resolution 6 (2013), which adopted the working definition of bioprospecting as:
“Any activity of search, identification, description, collection, survey, monitoring, cultivation, replication, or any other scientific investigation processes, performed on indigenous biological species, carried on within the area defined in Article VI of the Antarctic Treaty, with the initial intention to consider potential industrial or commercial derived products or applications, notably through the development of patentable material or process”.
However, some might argue that the expression “activity of search, identification, description, collection, survey, and monitoring” might not represent bioprospection for real biotechnological applications and could potentially interfere in basic studies such as those involving taxonomy, biodiversity, and ecology, which are important to know and preserve the different Antarctic environments and that could seriously impact conservation strategies. We, however, agree with the definition given in WP12 proposed by Belgium on “Native species”.
For this purpose, we propose a somewhat distinct definition of “Bioprospecting for biotechnological applications”, as follows:
"Activities of cultivation, replication or modification processes of any Antarctic native organisms conducive to biotechnological applications or industrial and commercial uses, including all organisms, their parts, as well as partial or whole genomes."
In the present paper we propose to discuss the definition of Bioprospection of Antarctic organisms and its use as a source of biotechnological bioproducts, as well as its consequences in resources and data sharing.
In addition, Resolution 6 does not include genomic/bioinformatics studies (like the sequence of whole genome) of Antarctic organisms, which search genes for biotechnological application. We understand that genomic/bioinformatics should be included in the discussion of bioprospection and could be part of Resolution 6.
