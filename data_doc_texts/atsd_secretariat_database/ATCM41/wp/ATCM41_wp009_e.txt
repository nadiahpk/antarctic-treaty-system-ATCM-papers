Subsidiary Group on Management Plans 
Report of activities during the intersessional period 2017-2018
Working Paper submitted by Argentina on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
For the intersessional period 2017/2018, the SGMP was commissioned to work under the Terms of Reference agreed by CEP XIII and in relation to the tasks incorporated in the Work Plan of the Group, by CEP XX. In accordance with Terms of Reference 1 to 3, while no new plans were sent to the SGMP, the five management plans pending from the previous intersessional period would be reviewed by the SGMP. This document includes information on the status of the plans with pending review and on the other tasks assigned to the Group. Likewise, it proposes, for the next intersessional period, to maintain the same tasks included in the Work Plan adopted during CEP XX and incorporate others that CEP XXI consider appropriate
    1. Tasks agreed by CEP XX for the work of the SGMP during the intersessional period

Prepare report for CEP XXI against SGMP ToR 4 and 5

The terms of reference indicated in the work plan, and under which the SGMP worked, are those adopted by CEP XIII and are included as Annex 1.
        a. Review of Management Plans under Tors 1 to 3. Current situation
Regarding ToR 1 to 3, the SGMP was commissioned to give further advice and complete the review process of five Management Plans, initiated in 2014, once the updated versions of those management plans were provided by the proponent (Chile). Management plans correspond to the following Antarctic Specially Protected Areas:

    • ASPA No. 125: Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (25 de Mayo)  (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 144: ‘Chile Bay’ (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 145: Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 146: South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 150: Ardley Island (Ardley Peninsula), Maxwell Bay, King George Island (25 de Mayo)  (Chile).
The five management plans referred to in point 1 are still under review by the Proponent (Chile), so the revised versions on which the SGMP would provide advice were not available for this purpose. Therefore, there is no progress to report with respect to the past intersessional, period 2017/2018.
Each of these Management Plans under review continue with their respective coordinators, according to what they expressed during the intersessional period: Kate McKenzie ASPA 125, Anoop Tiwary ASPA 144 and 150, Polly Penhale ASPA 145, Birgit Njåstad ASPA 146.
        b. Task under ToRs 4 and 5

    • Suggested task, “Work with relevant Parties to ensure progress on review of management plans overdue for five year review”

On October 31, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat sent a reminder for relevant CEP Members regarding ASPA/ASMA management plans that are due for five year review in 2018.
Through the SGMP forum, Parties that may need advice to initiate the five-year review of Management Plans were invited to contact the SGMP if they so wished. No requests were received, but it is recalled that the SGMP is available to advise, facilitate or guide the review tasks.

    • Suggested Task: “Consider further improvements to the Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation”

During CEP XX, the Committee endorsed the Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation and the Guidelines for the preparation of Antarctic Specially Managed Area management plans and agreed to forward to the ATCM for approval a draft Resolution encouraging their dissemination and use (paragraph 136). Finally, the ATCM adopted the Guidelines through Resolution 1 (2017).

Also, the Committee agreed that in a future revision of the Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation it could be useful to include a scheme or table that would illustrate/ summarise the process of assessing and drawing conclusions with regard to assessing an area for potential ASMA designation. It was noted that this could further improve the guidelines and facilitate the decision-making process. (paragraph 133).

Regarding this proposal, and considering that during the organization process of the ATCM XLI / CEP XXI in its abbreviated format, it was encouraged to postpone until 2019 any proposal that does not necessarily require a resolution during CEP XXI, the coordinator of the SGMP suggested postponing moving forward in this task, being that the new Guidelines have been recently adopted and there would be no urgency to adopt improvements this year. This proposal had no objections and the task was postponed.

    3. Advice to CEP
The SGMP provides the following advice to CEP:

• That the five management plans pending in the previous periods continue to be within the scope of the SGMP, in order to provide advice once the proposing country has made the revised versions available to the Group.
• That the CEP consider the Work Plan and suggest appropriate modifications if needed, based on the deliberations during CEP XXI.

Annex 1. Revised Terms of Reference for the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans. (CEP XIII. Final Report. Appendix 1) 

    1) Examine any draft new or revised Management Plan to consider, in consultation with relevant experts if appropriate:
    • whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol, particularly Articles 3, 4 and 51, and with relevant CEP guidelines2;
    • its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness3;
    • whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation4; and
    • whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole5. 

    2) Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.

    3) Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management Plan, identifying where the Plan reflects comments received by Members, and where they have not been, the reasons for not doing so. The Working Paper is to include all revised Management Plans and the information required by the ATCM’s Legal and Institutional Working Group.

4)  Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review. 

5)  Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent and likely to be effective6.
