Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island 








Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island 

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan.
Background
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island, in accordance with Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the ‘Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ appended to Resolution 2 (2011). 
ASPA No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island (70°48’S, 68°30’W, approximately 180 km2) was designated originally in 1989 as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 29 Ablation Point – Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island, through Recommendation XV-6, after a proposal by the United Kingdom. 

The primary reason for the designation of Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights as ASPA No. 147 is to protect scientific values, relating particularly to the geology, geomorphology and ecology of this extensive ablation area.  The Area contains exposed rocks spanning the Jurassic – Cretaceous boundary, an exceptional and unique contiguous geomorphological record of glacier and ice-shelf fluctuations extending over several thousand years, two perennially frozen freshwater lakes, which have the unusual property of contact with the saline waters of George VI Sound, and exceptional communities of terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna.

A revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 147 is provided at Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Management Plan. Minor amendments are summarised as follows:
    • The Supporting Information has been updated.
    • The following text has been added under section 7(ii) Access to and movement within or over the Area: ‘Overflight of bird colonies within the Area by RPAS shall not be permitted unless for scientific or operational purposes, and in accordance with a permit issued by an appropriate national authority’.
    • A note of the removal of two fuel drums from the Area has been added to section 6 Description of the Area.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA Management Plans and with the ‘Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’.
Recommendation
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island (Attachment A).
