Tourist Vessels flagged to non Parties; 
Implications for the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty System
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand



Overview
At the 29th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, a number of delegations expressed concerns about the flagging of tourist vessels participating in the Antarctic tourism trade to non Antarctic Treaty Parties.  An examination of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) commercial Antarctic tourist vessel figures over the past five seasons has shown that 30-40% of vessels operated by IAATO Members are flagged to countries not Party to the Antarctic Treaty nor its Protocol on Environmental Protection.  Figures are available in ATCM XXIX IP 86 and previous IPs submitted to ATCMs XXV - XXVIII.    
This paper considers the possible implications of non Party vessels for the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty System and raises three questions to promote discussion of this issue:
    1) How might the activities of non Party vessels operating in the Antarctic Treaty Area impact on the implementation of the Protocol?
    2) What implications do non Party vessels have for the Antarctic Treaty system inspection regime?
    3) What obligations have non Parties, which exercise jurisdiction and control over tourist vessels operating in Antarctica, assumed that help address concerns around the protection of the Antarctic environment?


1. How might the activities of non Party vessels operating in the Antarctic Treaty Area impact on the implementation of the Protocol?

Environmental Impact Assessment

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Protocol) requires each Party to ensure that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures set out in Annex I to the Protocol are applied in the planning process leading to decisions about activities, including tourism activities, to be undertaken in the Antarctic Treaty area (Article 8(2)).  Parties are also expected to ensure that appropriate procedures are put in place to assess and verify the activity’s impact, and to require the expedition organiser to comply with any conditions imposed as a result of the EIA process.  

The situation where the organiser of a tourist expedition is a national of or a company registered in an Antarctic Treaty Party, but is carrying out its activities using a non Party vessel, may pose a problem.  It is the flag state which has the duty to “effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag” (UNCLOS Article 94).  In the case of non Party vessels, the Parties need to rely on the obligations they impose on expedition organisers to comply with the requirements of the Protocol.  As the ultimate control of the vessel does not normally lie with the expedition organizer however, compliance with the Protocol may be frustrated.

Article 15 of the Protocol (Emergency Response Action)

Under Article 15 of the Protocol, the Parties agreed to provide for prompt and effective response action to emergencies which might arise in the performance of activities, including tourist activities, in the Antarctic Treaty Area.  In an emergency situation involving a non Party vessel, there is no such agreement to provide response action under this Article.  This may have particular significance for emergency response action in the interim before Annex VI comes into force.
2. What implications do non Party vessels have for the Antarctic Treaty system inspection regime?

Under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty, Parties can appoint observers to carry out inspections of all areas of Antarctica, including all ships at points of discharge or embarking cargoes.  This system of inspection ensures that the fundamental principles and obligations in the Antarctic Treaty are upheld.

In order to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and to ensure compliance with the Protocol, inspections may also be arranged under Article 14 of the Protocol.  This is an important auditing function to enable Parties to monitor environmental impacts and accordingly adjust regulation to ensure sufficient protection of the Antarctic environment.

In the case of a non Party vessel, there is no obligation to enable an inspection to be carried out. 

3. What obligations have non Parties, which exercise jurisdiction and control over tourist vessels operating in Antarctica, assumed that help address concerns around the protection of the Antarctic environment?

Other international maritime conventions provide a residual layer of regulation (where applicable) for non Party vessels.  The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) conventions broadly cover deliberate pollution as a consequence of routine ship operations, prevention and clean-up of pollution arising from accidents, and liability and compensation for such incidents.

The most important of these is the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution and its 1978 Protocol (MARPOL 73/78) which contains two compulsory annexes on oil pollution and the carriage of noxious liquid substances.  Its other three annexes are not compulsory and address regulations for the prevention of pollution from harmful substances carried in a packaged form, prevention of pollution by sewage, and prevention of pollution by garbage.  MARPOL’s Protocol of 1997 introduced a new Annex VI on Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships.  Article 4 of MARPOL provides that all violations of its norms must be punished under the internal legislative provisions of State parties concerning reparations.  The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 (OILPOL) prohibiting the deliberate discharge of specified oil mixtures in designated area 50 miles from land was superseded by MARPOL.  A list of other relevant IMO Conventions is included at Annex I.

A summary of IMO conventions and non Party flags is attached as Annex II.  It should be noted, however, that countries may have domestic legislation that enforces convention provisions even where they are not a Party to a convention. 
Annex I: International Maritime Organisation Conventions

    • The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 including its 1978 and 1988 Protocols (SOLAS).  Aims for the protection of human life by regulating safety aspects of the construction of ships, including rules on navigation, fire prevention and prevention of pollution.

    • The Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 and its Protocol of 1996.

    • The International Convention on Load lines 1966 and its Protocol of 1988.  Relates to ship loading limits to prevent overloading that would lead to casualties.  Provisions concerning casualties are the same as under SOLAS.

    • The International Convention on Tonnage measurements of Ships 1969.

    • The Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (COLREG).  Contains the majority of the rules of navigation, applying to all vessels on the high seas and in all waters connected therewith that are navigable by sea-going vessels.

    • The International Convention for Safe Containers 1972.

    • The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978 (STCW) jointly drafted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the IMO.  Incorporates aspects of environmental protection, as well as safety of life and property.

    • The 1979 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR).  Establishes the legal and technical basis for an international search and rescue plan, facilitating cooperation on rescue operations.

    • The Convention on the International Maritime Satellite Organisation of 1976 (IMMERSAT).  Improves maritime communications, thereby assisting in improving distress and safety of life at sea communications, the efficiency and management of ships, maritime public correspondence services, and radiodetermination capabilities.

    • The Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic of 1965.  Prevents unnecessary delays in maritime traffic through uniformity in procedural formalities.

    • The International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (CLC).  Requires full insurance for all ships entering the ports of member states, including any visiting vessels not flagged to a member state.

    • Special Trade Passenger Ships Agreement of 1971.

    • International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (FUND) of 1971.  Provides compensation for pollution damage to the extent that the protection afforded by the 1969 Civil Liability Convention is inadequate.

    • Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988.  Developed measures to prevent unlawful acts which threaten the safety of ships and the security of their passengers and crew.

    • International Convention on Salvage 1989.  

    • International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation 1990 (OPRC).

    • International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS) 1996.  Not yet in force.
