Guidelines for Tourist Visits to Snow Hill      
Working paper for the CEP and the ATCM presented by Argentina and Sweden    

In agreement with Resolution 5 (2005) which establishes the “Site Guidelines for Land-Based Tourist-Visited Areas”; with Resolution 2 (2006) which incorporates guidelines for seven new sites; and with the statement of the CEP in the Final Report of its IXth meeting, that members of the CEP “with specific knowledge of visited sites not already covered by visitor guidelines or other forms of site management, undertake site reviews and draft Site Guidelines, using a consistent format, as appropriate, Argentina and Sweden present draft guidelines for the management of tourist visits to the hut of the expedition led by Otto Nordensjköld (Historic Site and Monument number 38), a site on Snow Hill Island, for consideration by the CEP and for eventual adoption by the XXX ATCM.  Argentina and Sweden submit this document as part of a management strategy for the site and in their capacity as Parties charged with the management of Historic Site and Monument number 38, in accordance with the annex to Measure 3 (2003).
The growing number of visitors at the site in recent years, as well as the historical importance of the site        --recognized through its designation as a Historic Site and Monument in the framework of the Antarctic Treaty-- have created a need to elaborate a management framework for tourist activity in the area of influence of the shelter.  The purpose is to make tourism development compatible with management and conservation activities at the site.   
The format and contents of this draft are in response to that established in Resolution 2 (2006), with the objective of being coherent with the existing guidelines or those that are in the process of being adopted.  
The proponents of the Working Paper suggest that the CEP recommend to the ATCM that Resolution 2 (2006) be updated to include Snow Hill on the list of sites that receive visitors, and that the Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty publish Guidelines for Snow Hill on their Web page and in hard copy format, as has been done with the12 guidelines already agreed upon by the ATCM.
