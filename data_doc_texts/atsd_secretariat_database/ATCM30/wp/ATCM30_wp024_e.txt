Use of Ecodiesel in Antarctica           
Experience at “Artigas Station” 
1. Background
In the planning of the 2007 Antarctic campaign, the use of Ecodiesel (see: www.ecodiesel.com.uy), by mixing biodiesel with Antarctic gasoil in different proportions, was evaluated and considered.  Biodiesel is an agrofuel of biological origin homologated in Europe for the DIN 14.214 standards (Deustcher Industrie Normen), and in the United States for the provisions emanating from the ASTM D-6751 standards (American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials).  In Uruguay, biodiesel is produced largely from the processing of oleaginous crops, and soybean oil, selected for Antarctic purposes, is elaborated in accordance with the national UNIT 1.100 standard (Uruguayan Institute of Technical Norms) in a similar way to the European DIN standards.
According to evaluations of biodiesel, the fuel does not contain microorganisms.  In comparison with gasoil, the reduction in emissions anticipated by the technical specifications is in line with the principles of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection. 
Biodiesel has the same properties as petroleum-based diesel used for vehicles and can be mixed with it in any proportion. Moreover, it can be employed without modification in diesel engines, and is an alternative fuel that responds to EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) standards under Tier I Health Effects Section 211 (b) of the Clean Air Act.
The flammability of biodiesel is 50% that of gasoil, making its handling and storage safer. 
In terms of emissions, biodiesel produces 50% less carbon monoxide (CO), and almost no sulfur dioxide (SO2) due its very low (0.01% weight) or inexistent sulfur content.  In addition, it does not contain aromatic components, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from biodiesel can be reabsorbed by crops cultivated for its production.  It can therefore be considered a renewable resource.  
According to the EPA (A comprehensive analysis of biodiesel impacts on exhaust emissions, Draft Technical Report. EPA402-P-02-001, October 2002), results obtained from use of 20% soybean derived biofuel in combination with mineral gasoil are:

The biodegradability of biodiesel is an important characteristic in light of potential leaks or spills in the Antarctic environment.  Soy biodiesel biodegrades easily in both soil and water, 88.49% in 28 days, while the biodegradability of petroleum-based gasoil is only 26% during the same time period. Mixtures of biodiesel with gasoil accelerate the biodegradability of petroleum-based fuel, making use of mixtures with greater amounts of biodiesel a possibility for ships.
Regarding the difficulties associated with its use in Antarctica, maximum storage time is limited to 6 months but can be extended with the use of additives.  The other alternative is to use biodiesel during the three summer months, without the need for additives to stabilize it.  In addition, biodiesel tends to freeze before gasoil, although mixtures with less than 20% biodiesel tend to maintain the properties of gasoil.  Mixtures with less than 5% biodiesel have properties similar to those of gasoil.. 
2. Purpose and Objectives 
The purpose of using this alternative fuel is to evaluate its performance in the cold climate of Antarctica  starting with ongoing experience in Uruguay, where it is conveniently used for urban public transportation. Several tests were thus planned, using Ecodiesel in different strengths in mixtures of biodiesel with Antarctic gasoil.  Mixtures were used in vehicles for land transport, and also in the waste incinerator of the Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base, keeping in mind that results would be evaluated for consideration of its use in electrical generators. 
The experience at the Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base took place during the Antarctic summer season, in the months of December, January, and February, because of the less extreme temperatures occurring during this period (maximum     8ºC on December 27, minimum -2,8ºC on January 02).  Moreover, this was seen as a way to learn from the process of global warming, and as a way to reduce environmental impacts during the months of greatest human activity in Antarctica.  
The three main objectives are to:
    • progressively reduce the quantity of gasoil used to date that is derived from fossil fuel of non-renewable origin, gradually substituting it with ecological fuel of renewable origin and Uruguayan production.  The maximum proportions to be reached will be 20% biodiesel (B-20) in cases where Ecodiesel is employed in the engines of land vehicles, and 100% in cases where pure Biodiesel is used in waste incinerators;
    • reduce emissions of escape gases from vehicles and the incinerator of the Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base, and in turn reduce the products that could be toxic to humans and native fauna, with a view to contributing to the conservation of the Antarctic environment;
    • put into practice the use of Ecodiesel as an alternative fuel, by implementing the provisions of the Law of Uruguay Nº 17.567 and complementary instruments that regulate production and rational use in a gradual and increasing way over the next 10 years, making this alternative energy source sustainable.
3. Activities and Results 
To achieve the proposed goal and objectives, several activities were carried out. Static tests involved the exposure of fuel samples in the field to verify their performance according to the technical specifications regarding the cloud point at different temperatures.  As well, pilot dynamics tests were carried out in the vehicles and in the waste incinerator of the Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base.  A description of the activities follows:
    • In the statics tests, samples of pure Biodiesel and samples of Ecodiesel of various gradations of biodiesel with Antarctic gasoil, were subjected to testing in the Antarctic environment to check the technical specifications at different temperatures.  The following results were obtained:
    • Pure soy biodiesel (B-100) began to show signs of freezing in its appearance at 0ºC dry-bulb temperature in the meteorological enclosure.
    • The Ecodiesel mixture of biodiesel with Antarctic gasoil withstood lower temperatures, maintaining its clear appearance, while the mixture of 20% biodiesel with Antarctic gasoil (B-20) withstood the minimum temperature of –2.8ºC, registered in the month of January (January 02, 2007) on a dry-bulb thermometer in the meteorological enclosure.
    • In the dynamics tests of function that followed the statics tests of the samples, Ecodiesel was employed in different proportions, from 5% (B-5) in a snow track vehicle to 20% (B-20) in a wheel truck.  In addition, pure biodiesel (B-100) was used in the waste incinerator. The results of the tests are: 
    • In a Hägglunds snow track vehicle (model Bv 206) with a Mercedes Benz diesel engine (100 KW, 2.996 cc), different mixtures of Ecodiesel were progressively used, starting at 1% biodiesel and reaching a maximum of 5% (B-5). The tests confirmed normal operation of the vehicle, with advantages similar to those when Antarctic gasoil alone is used alone.
    • The mixture was limited to 5% (B-5) as a precautionary measure, because at this level of mixture the point of overflow is close to that of Antarctic gasoil (-21ºC temperature).  As the vehicle is one of two vehicles used for scientific and logistic activities and may also be used in the case of an emergency, the measure ensures the availability of the second vehicle. 
    • In another vehicle, a 4x4 IFA W50 (92 HP, 6.560 cc), mixtures of different proportions of up to 20% (B-20) biodiesel were used.  Vehicle performance on land, which was limited to the surroundings of the base and nearby areas, was acceptable.  The vehicle was kept near the base, because it was the first time that an experiment was done with the maximum content of biodiesel.  According to international experiences, it maintains properties of fluidity similar to those of Antarctic gasoil.
    • In the waste incinerator UMWELT (GSA Brazil), different mixtures of Ecodiesel were employed including the use of pure Biodiesel (B-100).  With pure Biodiesel, the equipment operated normally, with equal performance to that of mineral gasoil, although it must be taken into account that the fuel tank is within the service area of the Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base in a heated environment.  
In order to quantify the contribution of the experiences with biodiesel to the conservation of the Antarctic environment, gas and particulate emissions, as well as the level of noise were measured.  These data will be compared to those that will be obtained during the next summer season when similar tests are conducted.  
4. Conclusions
    • The field tests conducted with the vehicles, using Ecodiesel with combinations of biodiesel of up to 20% (B-20), reveal the satisfactory performance of the terrain vehicles, in the environmental conditions that correspond to the summer temperatures in Antarctica at 62º 11´ S on Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base.
    • Stored for three months time, the biodiesel fuel maintained its properties, however motors should be inspected next year to verify the absence of signs of corrosion or blockage of filters and other components of the fuel supply system.       
    • The waste incinerator can be used with pure Biodiesel (B-100) during the three summer months when the largest quantities of waste are produced as a result of the increase in Antarctic scientific, logistic, and environmental activities and the increased presence of humans.  The benefit is a reduction in emissions in comparison to the use of gasoil.
    • With relation to increased use of Ecodiesel, as a renewable and environmentally friendly fuel in the Antarctic environment, there is potential for its use in motogenerators of electrical energy whose fuel tanks are in the interior of the service areas of the base.  In the interior, heating provides adequate conditions for the use of mixtures with 20% biodiesel (B-20), or eventually more, during the whole year.   This would contribute to a notable reduction in escape emissions.
5. Recommendations
It is requested that the ATCM consider recommendations for approval regarding the following aspects:
    • Promote from Antarctica, in light of Internal Polar Year 2007-2008, the increased use of biodiesel in polar regions as an alternative renewable and environmentally friendly fuel source, and as a proposal for social and economic sustainable development.  
    • Request that COMNAP promotes, among the National Antarctic Programs whose Antarctic stations and bases have adequate environmental and operational conditions for the use of biodiesel, further studies and experiments with biodiesel during the Austral summer, with the purpose of contributing to a reduction in emissions in the Antarctic environment.
