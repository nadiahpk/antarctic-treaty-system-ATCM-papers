A Five-Year Work plan for the CEP: Report of the Intersessional Contact Group




A Five-Year Work plan for the CEP: Report of the Intersessional Contact Group
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand

Introduction
At its last few meetings the CEP has given time to considering its strategic direction.  The issue was first raised at the VIIth meeting of the Committee in Cape Town (paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Final Report of CEP VII), and was taken substantively forward in discussions (both formal and informal) at CEP VIII in Sweden (paragraphs 11 to 32 of the Final Report of CEP VIII).
In advance of the most recent meeting of the Committee in Edinburgh, an informal workshop was held to discuss “Antarctica’s Future Environmental Challenges”, with a view to assessing the future workload and priorities of the CEP.  The outcomes to the workshop were considered at CEP IX (paragraphs 6 to 11 of the Final Report of CEP IX).
At CEP IX, the Committee agreed to establish an intersessional contact group (ICG) to take forward the notion of developing a five-year work plan for the CEP, as a means of prioritising and better managing the Committee’s workload.  The following terms of reference were set at CEP IX:
    • Review the outcomes of the CEP Workshop as recorded in ATCM XXIX / WP 42 and ATCM XXIX / IP 113 (rev 1);
    • Consider the work undertaken by CCAMLR to develop a five-year work plan for its WG-EMM, as a model example;
    • Take account of the IPY planning work considered at CEP IX;
    • On the basis of the above, develop a draft five-year, prioritised work plan for consideration at CEP X; and
    • Prepare advice for CEP X on practical measures that the CEP might consider in managing its work, including for example, themed meetings, standing groups and workshops.
The Committee agreed that Dr Neil Gilbert (New Zealand) would convene the ICG.  The Committee also encouraged CEP Members, Observers and Experts to submit papers to CEP X on issues identified for immediate focus (paras 9 – 11 of the Final Report of CEP IX refer).
Intersessional Contact Group
Due to time constraints, and a less then 12-month period between CEP meetings, the intersessional contact group (ICG) had two rounds of discussion.  Both discussion papers and all the feedback received were posted on the CEP’s Discussion Forum webpage.  11 Parties and one Invited Expert provided responses based on the first discussion paper.  13 Parties and one Invited Expert provided responses on the second discussion paper.
Summary of ICG discussions
a) First Round: Discussions focused on the scope of work that the CEP currently has before it and potential new issues that were raised at the Edinburgh Workshop.  Feedback was requested from the ICG participants on the relative priorities of the list of responsibilities and tasks facing the Committee.


Responses indicated that:
    • The CEP is unable to continue to try and address every issue at every meeting and there is a need to prioritise our workload;
    • The CEP’s task list can be divided into two categories: 
    • The first category covers “pressures on the Antarctic environment” that arise (largely) as a result of human activity, or natural environmental change;
    • The second category includes the tools that the CEP has available to it and which need to be adequately implemented for the CEP to fulfil its mandate.
    • There are differing views among CEP Members as to the relative priorities of tasks, but that this might be overcome by taking an environmental risk approach to judging the priority of tasks;
    • Some tasks cannot necessarily be prioritised and remain as “must do” responsibilities (for example processing protected area management plans and CEEs);
    • There is interest among CEP Members for exploring other mechanisms for handling the CEP’s workload, in particular the establishment of subsidiary bodies (under rule 10 of the CEP’s Rules of Procedure).
b) Second round: A table was prepared setting out the list of issues facing the CEP, divided into “CEP tools” and “Environmental Pressures”.  A relative priority was placed on each of these issues based on the responses received and a somewhat subjective assessment of environmental risk.  ICG participants were requested to consider the mechanisms that might be used to address each of the tasks and a possible timeline for doing so.
Responses indicated that:
    • There is a need to develop a robust means of assessing the environmental risk posed by environmental pressures;
    • There is broad agreement among Members that the use of subsidiary bodies would assist the CEP in addressing certain tasks (examples included matters related to area protection, and matters related to EIA – notably handling draft CEEs), though there remain significant questions as to how such subsidiary bodies may function;
    • The CEP should remain cognisant of the fact that SCAR and COMNAP provide considerable expertise and support to the CEP, which should continue to be utilised;
    • Certain of the tasks listed in the table can be grouped together (for example: biodiversity and non-native species, as well as, human footprint / wilderness management with area protection);
Five year work plan.
During both rounds of discussion three tables were prepared as a means of capturing the comments received.  Please see the attached tables in Appendix 1 to this paper.
Table 1 provides a full overview of the CEP’s work programme including an attempt at a risk assessment for each of the identified environmental pressures, leading to a proposed priority rating (high, medium or low).  It also includes potential actions that the CEP may need to address in respect of each of the issues, though this is unlikely to be comprehensive at this stage.  Finally, it summarises the feedback provided by ICG participants with respect to the mechanisms and timetable by which the Committee might deal with each issue.
Table 2 summarises the first, but lists the various issues in identified priority order.
Table 3 summarises the suggested mechanisms and timetable for the CEP’s handling of each issue, by year between CEP X and CEP XV.
It is important to note that these tables are as yet incomplete (and remain to be scrutinized by the Committee).  At this stage they simply provide a summary of the views and feedback provided by ICG participants.  However, it is suggested that, with further refinement, these may form the basis of the CEP’s five-year work plan.
Conclusions
What has the ICG been able to agree?
Despite only two rounds of discussion in this ICG, it is suggested that we have made good progress towards a five year planned programme of work for the Committee.  In that regard there are certain matters on which there was broad, if not unanimous agreement within the ICG:
    • The ICG agreed that the CEP should no longer attempt to deal with every issue at every meeting, and that there was a strong case for prioritising the CEP’s workload.
    • The ICG recognised that there are (at least) two categories of issue that the CEP needs to deal with: those issues related to implementing the requirements of the Protocol (the CEP’s tools) and those issues related to “environmental pressures” on the Antarctic environment.  The former are likely to require ongoing attention.  The latter lend themselves more to a prioritised approach.
    • In attempting to prioritise the environmental pressures facing the Antarctic environment, the ICG recognised the need to assess priorities on the basis of environmental risk.
    • There was broad support for the need to consider establishing one or more subsidiary bodies (in accordance with rule 10 of the CEP’s rules of procedure) to assist in handling the Committee’s workload.
    • In respect of such subsidiary bodies the ICG focussed on two possible types: Standing Groups to deal with routine ongoing issues (e.g. protected area management plans) and Expert Groups that might be established to deal with specific issues in a time-limited manner.1

What do we still need to discuss?
Clearly with only two rounds of discussion, the ICG was unable to discuss, and provide advice on all aspects of a five-year work plan for the CEP.  Nevertheless the ICG was able to identify key issues on which further discussion and decisions are required by the Committee.
    • Whilst there was broad support for the principle of establishing one or more subsidiary bodies, many questions were raised within the ICG as to how these might be established and how they might function.  Questions for further discussion include: how would such bodies differ from the existing ICG process?  Would subsidiary bodies be expected to meet during the intersessional period?  If meetings were required how might these be funded, and could Secretariat funds be made available to support them?
    • The ICG also noted the potential to establish one subsidiary body in the near future on a trial basis, as a means of testing the concept.  If the Committee was supportive of this idea, the ICG broadly agreed that a Standing Group on area protection would be a useful example.
    • Clearly the five-year plan has yet to be finalised.  The key issues requiring further attention are the mechanisms and timetable by which the CEP’s work programme will be undertaken (should the CEP make use of workshops, or subsidiary bodies, or simply discuss the matter at its annual meeting etc?).
    • The ICG agreed that a more substantive and consistent means for assessing environmental risk was needed in order to analyse the relative priorities of environmental pressures facing the Antarctic environment.
    • The ICG recognised that as the five-year plan begins to be implemented the CEP’s agenda will need to be routinely modified to ensure consistency with the work plan.
    • The ICG noted the potential of further simplifying the CEP’s task list by combining certain issues.  For example, if established, a Standing Group on area protection might also be tasked with overseeing the list of historic sites and monuments as well as undertaking a gap analysis using the SEGF.  Further, the issue of non-native species might easily be combined into the broader issue of biodiversity management.
Next steps
For the purposes of CEP X, it is recommended that the Committee allocate adequate time to discussing the issue of the five-year work plan.  To ensure a focussed discussion, it is recommend that the CEP first reviews the work that has been undertaken to date, and in particular the Excel spreadsheets attached to this Working Paper.  Secondly, the Committee might then use the unresolved issues (noted above under the heading “What do we still need to discuss?”) as a guide to further discussion.
The ICG also notes that, if agreed and implemented, a five year work programme will have two particular benefits: it should allow the CEP to give attention to the highest priority issues and make more rapid progress on them; it will also provide the ATCM with guidance as to the advice it can expect from the Committee and over what timetable.
Finally, once agreed, the ICG recommends that the five-year plan be treated as an ongoing or “rolling” plan and be reviewed by the Committee every year.  The updated plan should then be appended to the Final Report of each meeting of the Committee.
