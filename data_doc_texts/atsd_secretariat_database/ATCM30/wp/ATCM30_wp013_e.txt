Environmental Impact of Tourism and Other Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand


It was agreed at ATCM XXIX in Edinburgh that the question of permanent land-based infrastructure to support tourism and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica would be revisited at ATCM XXX.   As the Final Report of ATCM XXIX records (paragraphs 161-171), no delegation spoke in favour of the development of new permanent land-based infrastructure to support tourism and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica and many delegations supported a draft resolution tabled by the United Kingdom on Limiting Permanent Non-Governmental Infrastructure in Antarctica.  The draft resolution proposed that Parties should refrain from authorising permanent land-based facilities in Antarctica that are not in support of national Antarctic science programmes or associated with a government operator.  Nevertheless, the necessary consensus for the adoption of the resolution proved elusive at that meeting.
The meeting had before it a working paper submitted by New Zealand and Australia (XXIX ATCM/WP-15 Regulation of Land-Based Infrastructure to Support Tourism in Antarctica), which surveyed previous discussion of the subject, canvassed some available approaches and posed a number of questions for examination.  These questions related inter alia to the extent of land-based tourism activities in Antarctica; its potential impact on national programmes as well as the consequences for the Antarctic Treaty System of the jurisdictional issues raised by land-based tourism; and, likely cumulative environmental impacts.
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) also provided an information paper in XXIX ATCM/IP- 85 Land-Based Tourism and the Development of Land-based Tourism Infrastructure in Antarctica: An IAATO Perspective.  This discussed the definition of Land-Based Tourism and gave IAATO’s position on Land-Based Facilities.  
IAATO also made the useful suggestion (in New Zealand’s view) that the ATCM should “endorse the concept that all tourism activity is guided by the principle that tourism should have no more than a minor or transitory impact on Antarctica”.  In this regard IAATO recalled that its membership subscribes by virtue of an IAATO bylaw to the principle that their planned activities will have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.  
New Zealand would like to see the concept within this proposal by IAATO considered further at ATCM XXX.  It is aware that in past discussions caution has been expressed about appearing to set up a “dual system for EIA” in respect of governmental and non-governmental activities (XXVII ATCM/WP- 04, paragraph 37).  The environmental impact procedures set out in Annex One of the Protocol on Environmental Protection do indeed apply without any apparent room for discrimination to “any activities undertaken in the Antarctic Treaty area pursuant to scientific research programmes, tourism and all other governmental and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area for which advance notice is required under Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty, including associated logistic support activities” (Article 8.2 of the Protocol refers).
At the same time, however, any proposed activity, including any proposed tourism activity, which is determined to be likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact requires the preparation of a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation.  The draft CEE in turn needs to be considered by the ATCM on the advice of the Committee on Environmental Protection.  In keeping with Article 4 of Annex 1 to the Protocol, any decision on whether a proposed activity should actually proceed and if so, whether in its original or in a modified form, needs to be based on the CEE and “other relevant considerations”.   New Zealand is of the view that this “other relevant considerations” provision in Annex 1 of the Protocol in respect of the EIA procedures allows the Treaty Parties to take into account the purpose and wider context of any proposed activity which will have more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, and therefore to discriminate for example between scientific activities (whose contribution to human knowledge may in many cases be judged to outweigh their impact on the environment) and tourism and other non-governmental activities,  if they wish to do so.
New Zealand considers it would be appropriate for the Consultative Parties to take up IAATO’s proposal and to express collectively their view that tourism and other non-governmental activities should have no more than a minor or transitory impact upon Antarctica, by means of a resolution.  Such a resolution would have not only the support of the majority of the Antarctic tourism industry as has already been indicated by IAATO, but it would also provide reassurance to members of the public in our own countries and to the wider international community that the ATCM is alert to the risks posed by the rapid expansion and diversification of tourism and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica and is prepared to take effective steps to address the very real threat of long-term environmental degradation resulting from them.  New Zealand is convinced such a resolution would be of practical value to the Parties when they consider proposals for activities in Antarctica under their national legislation or regulations, and would also be widely welcomed and reflect well on the Antarctic Treaty System as a whole.  A draft resolution for the ATCM’s consideration is appended to this working paper.
Resolution X (2007)
Environmental Impact of Tourism and Other Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area

The Representatives,

Conscious of the rapid expansion and diversification of tourism and other non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area;
Recalling the Environmental Principles contained in Article 3 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty; 
Noting that, in relation to any proposed activity which is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact upon the Antarctic environment, the Protocol provides at Annex 1, Article 4, for any decision on whether the activity should proceed to be based on the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation as well as other relevant considerations; 
Bearing in mind that such other relevant considerations may include the objectives and context of the proposed activity;
Noting also that it is necessary to keep under review the adequacy and quality of Initial Environmental Evaluation for tourism and other non-governmental activities;
Desiring to limit the potential impacts of tourism and other non-governmental activities upon the Antarctic environment;

Recommend that:

In the case of any proposed tourism or other non-governmental activity which is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact upon the Antarctic environment the Parties should decide that the activity should not proceed.
