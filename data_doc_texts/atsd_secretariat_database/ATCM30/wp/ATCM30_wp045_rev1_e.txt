DRAFT RESOLUTION
(proposed by Australia)
Resolution D (2007)
Support for CCAMLR and action to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing
The Representatives, 
Recalling ATCM XXIII Resolution 3 (1999), SATCM XII Resolution 2 (2000), ATCM XXIV Resolution 2 (2001), and ATCM XXV Resolution 3 (2002) in which they expressed support for the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in its continued efforts aimed at eliminating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Convention Area;
Recalling also Resolution 1 (2006) which recommended that the ATCM regularly reflect upon the contribution made by CCAMLR to the Antarctic Treaty system, including in respect of the conservation and protection of the Antarctic environment;
Noting with appreciation the report of the CCAMLR Observer at ATCM XXX; 
Welcoming the progress made by CCAMLR in reducing IUU fishing in the Convention Area, including through use of the System of Inspection, implementation of the catch documentation scheme and centralised vessel monitoring system, and closing parts to IUU vessels; 
Concerned that IUU fishing continues to threaten the objectives of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and thus undermines the integrity of the Antarctic Treaty system; and
Concerned that within the Convention area, the conservation status of species and ecosystems and habitats upon which those species and associated and dependent species depend, remain under threat from IUU fishing; 
Recommend that: 
All Parties to the Antarctic Treaty which are Party to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, including those which are not Members of its Commission: 
    a. implement fully all relevant Conservation Measures adopted by CCAMLR, in particular Measures aimed at combating IUU fishing;
    b. redouble their efforts to address, in accordance with conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR, IUU fishing by their nationals and fishing vessels flying their flags, including adhering to the CCAMLR System of Inspection1, and ensuring that effective monitoring, control and surveillance measures are in place to prevent and deter IUU fishing.
