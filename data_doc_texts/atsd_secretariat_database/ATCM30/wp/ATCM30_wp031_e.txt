Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 109 
Moe Island, South Orkney Islands




Revised Management Plan for 
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 109 
Moe Island, South Orkney Islands

    1. Moe Island was originally designated as Specially Protected Area (SPA) No. 13 through Recommendation IV-13 (1966), after a proposal by the United Kingdom. The Area was designated on the grounds that it provided a representative sample of the maritime Antarctic ecosystem, that intensive experimental research on the neighbouring Signy Island might alter its ecosystem and that Moe Island should be specially protected as a control area for future comparison.  These grounds are still relevant.
    2. The Management Plan for SPA No. 13 was revised through Recommendation XVI-6 (1991), and further revised through Measure 1 (1995). The Area was re-named and re-numbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 109 through Decision 1 (2002).
    3. There have been no substantial changes made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan. The boundaries, maps and descriptions of the Area remain the same as in the existing Management Plan.
    4. Minor changes to the existing Management Plan include:
        (i) addition of information on fur seal impact on the Area
        (ii) the location of an alternative landing area for small boats
        (iii) updated maps showing the location of the South Orkney Islands and nearby scientific stations (Map 1), and the detail of Moe Island (Map 2)
        (iv) more comprehensive restrictions on materials and organisms that may be brought into the Area.
    5. The revised Management Plan is attached for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection.
