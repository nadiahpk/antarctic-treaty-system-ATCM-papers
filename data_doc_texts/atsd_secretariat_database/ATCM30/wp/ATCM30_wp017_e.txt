On the concept of the Antarctic Marine Protected Areas

Coming into force of Annex V “Area Protection and Management” of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty has become an important and efficient mechanism for conservation of the Antarctic nature. In Article 4, paragraph 1 of Annex V reads that any marine area may be designated as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area. Article 6, paragraph 2 of Annex V stipulates that no marine area shall be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (MPA) or an Antarctic Specially Managed Area without the prior approval of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Article IX paragraph 2g of the aforementioned Convention stipulates the designation of the closing of zones in the Convention territory, which actually present the MPA, as the conservation measure for marine living resources of the area. A small number of such MPAs were already designated in the CCAMLR structure.
Activity of the international community for intensification of the processes of delineating the marine protected areas of the world ocean (Convention on Biological Diversity, World Summit on Sustainable Development, World Parks Congress) determined an urgent need for designation of such areas in different regions of the world ocean up to 2012. In this connection, we should welcome the initiatives of Great Britain and CCAMLR at XXIX ATCM for formalization of the issues of MPA designation in the world ocean space, which is under the jurisdiction of the Antarctic Treaty system. 
In IP 3, XXIX ATCM submitted by Great Britain it was pointed out that the provisions for designation of MPAs were clearly formulated both in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and in the text of CCAMLR. 
It is obvious that protection of ecosystem processes, habitats and biodiversity and protection of species, including populations and different stages of the life cycle of development are the main priorities of CCAMLR for designation of MPAs. The Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP) of the Antarctic Treaty from its standpoint considers the MPAs based on the provisions of Annex V as:
    • Areas kept inviolate from human interference so that future comparisons may be possible with localities that have been affected by human activities, for example, by fishery;
    • Representative examples of marine ecosystems;
    • Areas with important or unusual assemblages of species;
    • The type locality or only known habitat of any marine species;
    • Areas of particular interest to on-going or planned scientific research;
    • Examples of outstanding geological and geomorphologic features of seabed and coast;
    • Areas of outstanding aesthetic and wilderness value;

So, the objectives of CCAMLR and CEP are quite similar regarding conservation of different marine biological species and scientific research. As to the areas of interest to marine geologists and the areas of outstanding aesthetic value, it is sufficiently difficult with respect to MPAs to develop special criteria to determine approaches to these values. The CCAMLR worked out the approaches to designation of MPAs at a special workshop held on 29 August to 1 September, 2005 (Silver Spring, Maryland, the USA). The workshop noted that the main goal of MPA designation in the Antarctic Treaty system should be creation of an agreed regime of protection of the Antarctic marine environment for all components of the Treaty system. 
From the viewpoint of CCAMLR, the results of nature protection activity should be in compliance with achieving the objectives of Article II of the Convention including both the conservation of biological diversity and of ecosystem processes. As the basic provision, Article II of the Convention envisages the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources (where the term “conservation” includes their rational use) and sets out the principles by which harvesting and associated activities are possible. The workshop recognized the need for developing a strategic approach to planning and application of MPAs for the entire Southern Ocean, especially regarding the system of protected areas. It was decided that overall the Convention Area when viewed in relation to the categories of protected areas will qualify as the category where the MPA is defined as an area of land and/or sea subject to active intervention for management purposes so as to ensure the maintenance of habitats and/or to meet the requirements of specific species. 
Some areas of the Southern Ocean can have predictable peculiarities, which are extremely important for functioning of local ecosystems. The workshop agreed that it would be desirable to include such areas to the system of protected areas. In some cases, an interim status can be applied for MPA designation. 
The major objectives for MPA designation in the opinion of the workshop participants are as follows:
    • Broad-scale bioregionalisation of the Southern Ocean;
    • Fine-scale subdivision of biogeographic provinces;
    • Identification of areas that might be used to achieve the conservation objectives;
    • Determination of areas requiring interim protection.
The next stage of discussing the bioregionalisation problems of the Southern Ocean waters was a workshop in Hobart, held in September 2006. The purpose of the workshop was to develop “proof of concept” of bioregionalisation of the Southern Ocean in order to assist the CCAMLR Scientific Committee in the work on this problem. As a result of discussions, a complex approach to bioregionalisation combining the statistical data on physical characteristics of oceanographic fields and expert knowledge of the biodiversity of the area was agreed on.  The outcomes of the workshop were considered in detail by the Scientific Committee at the XXV session of CCAMLR (Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, 21 October-3 November, 2006). The Scientific Committee recommended continuing submission of all ATCM proposals on the Protected Areas with a marine component for consideration by CCAMLR and adopting standard terminology at CCAMLR for discriminating the “ATCM draft plans for management of the areas with a marine component” and “the Marine Protected Areas (MPA)” as such.
The next CCAMLR workshop on bioregionalisation of the Southern Ocean will be held in August 2007 in Brussels (Belgium). The aims of the workshop will include:
    1) Practical development of the methods of bioregionalisation;
    2) Consideration of the methods for selection and classification of MPAs.
The information presented above is evidence of significant work undertaken by CCAMLR on the methods of MPA designation using up-to-date scientific knowledge. In this connection we believe that CEP should be actively involved in the joint work with CCAMLR in order to decrease the differences in the approaches and in the development of universal methods for designation of MPAs. We should simultaneously pay attention to the need of developing a procedure for coordinating the proposals for MPA designation with CCAMLR if they are submitted using the CEP structure. This procedure should be ultimately democratic and be based at the same time on the opinion of all CCAMLR participants, rather than of its expert group.
