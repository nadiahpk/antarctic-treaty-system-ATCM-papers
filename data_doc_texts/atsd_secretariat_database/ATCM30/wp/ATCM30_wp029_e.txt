Environmental Monitoring in Antarctica – lessons learned from the Arctic




Environmental monitoring in Antarctica – lessons learned from the Arctic
A. Introduction
The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) has over a number of years discussed the issue of environmental monitoring. At CEP VII the issue of coordinated monitoring of activities in Antarctica (including establishment of a consistent methodology, and central data collection processes) was raised in full as a consequence of discussions that took place during the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica (Tromsø, Norway). An ICG was consequently established to examine the issue in more depth. A report from this work was presented at CEP VIII (ATCM28/WP23) and the ICG was, after discussion in the Committee, mandated to continue its work for another year. A final report was presented at CEP IX (ATCM29/WP16). The ICG did not conclude as to the specifics of coordinated monitoring, and the discussion during the CEP underlined the complexity of the issue and difficulties to be encountered in establishing a framework for coordinated monitoring. 
During the discussion it was noted that it could be helpful to consider opportunities to draw on relevant environmental monitoring and reporting work being undertaken in the Arctic. On this basis Norway, as host of the international secretariat of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program Working Group of the Arctic council (AMAP) and as the current chair of the Arctic Council, Norway offered to bring information on the monitoring work under the Arctic Council to CEP X, both from the well established AMAP and the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP) under development by the Arctic Council Working Group Conservation of Arctic Fauna and Flora (CAFF). The Committee welcomed this offer from Norway1.
The following information is provided on basis of the above and may assist in further CEP discussions related to coordinated monitoring, including methodology and data collection processes. The paper provides descriptive information on the AMAP and CAFF monitoring structures, as well as an assessment of successes and challenges experienced within these processes. Finally, some conclusions are drawn with respect to how lessons learned in the Arctic Council context may have relevance and be used in the Antarctic context. 
B. Arctic Council 
In 1991 the eight Arctic countries2 adopted an Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). Five years later, in 1996, Foreign Ministers of the Arctic states agreed in the Ottawa Declaration to form the Arctic Council (AC), with a mandate to undertake a broad program to include all dimensions of sustainable development, and to address all three of its main pillars: environmental, social and economic. 

From the beginning, Arctic governments and indigenous peoples joined together to make environmental monitoring and assessment a key element of the AC's agenda. The approach of the AC encourages continuous dialogue among scientists, policy planners, Arctic residents and political level decision-makers.  The decision-making of the AC is heavily based on the scientific work done under the umbrella of the AC and also influenced by the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples. Decisions within the AC are taken at meetings of Foreign Ministers or their designees and the political leaders of the Permanent Participants3. 
C. Arctic Council Working Groups
Under its umbrella the AC has established six Working Groups. These are:
    • ACAP (Arctic Contaminants Action Program)
    • AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program)
    • CAFF (Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna)
    • EPPR (Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response)
    • PAME (Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment)
    • SDWG (Sustainable Development Working Group)



In the following we will focus on CAFF and AMAP since these are the Working Groups with environmental monitoring activities in their mandates. The monitoring programs to be discussed consist of all AMAP activities and CAFF’s cornerstone program, the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP).
CAFF and AMAP strategies
CAFF’s program center around five objectives, as set forth in the CAFF Strategic Plan 1998-2002:
    • monitoring of Arctic biodiversity
    • conservation of Arctic species and their habitats
    • establishment of protected areas
    • conservation of nature outside protected areas
    • integration of conservation objectives and measures for economic sectors of  the society
Since 1991, the primary objectives of AMAP have been:
    • to measure the levels, and assess the effects of anthropogenic pollutants in all compartments of the Arctic environment, including humans
    • to document trends in pollution (heavy metals, radio nuclides and POPs)
    • to document sources and pathways of pollutants
    • to examine the impact of pollution on Arctic flora and fauna, especially those used as food by indigenous people and the general population
    • to report on the state of the Arctic environment to Ministers and relevant fora
    • to give advice to Ministers on priority actions needed to improve the environmental conditions in the Arctic
The work of all AC Working Groups is almost entirely funded by the participating nations “in kind” contributions. 
Finally, all AC Working Groups work on a “lead country” basis, i.e. the tasks that the Working Groups commit to has to be lead by a country taking on the leading task voluntarily. 
Norway, as a member of the Arctic Council, participates fully in all AC Working Groups, and has through highly ambitious management plans and goals for the Norwegian Arctic and the Barents Sea valuable input to all these processes. In addition, as current Chair of the Arctic Council, Norway holds the chairmanship of SDWG and EPPR.
Secretariats
The Arctic Council Secretariat follows the AC Chairmanship, which rotates biennially between the member nations. From October 26 2006, Norway holds the chairmanship of the AC for two years, followed by Denmark (2 years) and Sweden (2 years). The Secretariat will be located at the Polar Environmental Center in Tromsø during the whole 6-year period. 
The CAFF International Secretariat is permanently located in Akureyri, Iceland. The secretariat has one full time employee and one administrative assistant who works for the Secretariat 12-16 hours per week. The annual budget is approx. USD 275,000 (2006) and the participating countries contribute on a voluntary, not mandatory, basis. So far most countries have contributed steadily.
The AMAP Secretariat, permanently located in Oslo, Norway, has four full-time employees, three scientific (Rotterdam, Moscow and Oslo) and one clerk (Oslo), plus some additional part-time assistance, both secretaries and scientists. The gross annual budget is 3.3 mill. NOK (= USD 535,000), of which the Norwegian Ministry of Environment at present is covering 2.2 mill. NOK (= USD 355,000). The rest has been raised through external funds.
D. Environmental monitoring
There are different terms in use in this document. The focal term is “environmental” monitoring. For the purpose of this document the different terms need some clarification. The relevant Arctic monitoring activities could be divided into three different types of monitoring, based on the types of activities or processes they aim to monitor:
    • Biodiversity monitoring
    • Monitoring of pollutants (incl. both trends and effects)
    • Monitoring of other pressure factors (e.g. climate change, human impact on habitats, introduced alien species, oil and gas activities etc.)
Biodiversity monitoring is part of the mandate of both CAFF and AMAP. Biodiversity monitoring is one of the principal mandates of CAFF, and implementation of the CBMP is the primary focal project. AMAP, mainly concerned with pollution and climate issues, has a main interest in detecting trends and effects of environmental pollutants in Arctic biota and abiota, and to establish causal links between pollution and biodiversity changes. 
Monitoring of other pressure factors is a concern of both CAFF and AMAP, and at some level monitoring of such pressures is an integral part of the programs, and the desire to establish causal links is a major motivation for both programs.
E. Program procedures and organization
CAFF/CBMP
Initial phase
CAFF’s Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP) has evolved from a version that was launched in 2000, at a CAFF/AMAP-sponsored workshop in Reykjavik, Iceland, which was endorsed at the 8th biennial CAFF meeting in Trondheim, Norway, the same year. There it was suggested to establish circumpolar biodiversity monitoring networks, mainly being single-species networks based on already existing networks of scientists. This had little or no initial success, for a couple of reasons:
    1. There was no administrative and professional entity that could motivate the network/program organization and run the process forwards on a daily basis.
    2. There were no funds following the network status, thereby creating no incentives with the scientists to carry out monitoring activities for CAFF.
Iceland then took the lead in 2002 to develop an application for the EU 5th Framework Program. At the 2004 Ministerial meeting a “fully fledged” CBMP was recognized through Arctic Council Ministers’ endorsement of the CBMP as the cornerstone program of CAFF. In 2005 Canada took the lead of the new CBMP (set forth in the CBMP Framework Document4 and all supporting documents published for the 2004 Ministerial). The new process was initiated with a first workshop in Ottawa in April 2005 and officially launched in Cambridge, UK in September 2005. 
Program organization
The figure below shows the draft organizational chart of most of the CBMP. 





Secretariat and lead country
Since February 2005 Canada has held the lead of the development of the CBMP. Canada also produced funds to maintain the CBMP Secretariat in Whitehorse. This has been the main reason for the “positive” development of the CBMP since spring 2005. The Secretariat has 2 full time and one half time employees. The gross annual budget is USD 400,000, that is fully covered by Canada.
Task teams
From 2005 the CBMP has had six designated task teams: Indicators, Data Management, Community-based Monitoring, Funding, Remote Sensing and Communication and Outreach. 
Program strategy
Main objectives
The main objectives of the CBMP are to:
    • Detect changes and causes of change in Arctic biodiversity.
    • Provide an early warning system, which could trigger more specific research and conservation measures.
    • Contribute to the development and evaluation of national and circumpolar conservation programs, policies, and measures.
    • Support the sustainable use of the Arctic’s living resources.
    • Provide for the timely and cost-effective sharing of information.
    • Increase the understanding of Arctic biodiversity, and its interaction with regional and global processes.
Cooperate with other AC Working Groups and other parties within and outside the Arctic. In particular, coordinate monitoring efforts between CAFF and AMAP.

Existing national programs
CBMP has, from the beginning, emphasized that monitoring activities to be included in the program should preferably already be part of existing national programs. This is the best and possibly the only realistic way to ensure long-term funding. Long-term funding of monitoring activities from external, international sources is highly uncertain, and extremely difficult to achieve. There are exceptions, e.g. SEAPOP (Seabird Populations), which is a 10-year Norwegian seabird monitoring program, mainly funded by the oil industry.
Number of indicators
In the initial phase, CBMP will focus on a small suite of indicators. The main reason for this decision is to facilitate a long life for the program. The indicators list is being finalized at present.
Selection of indicators
CBMP believes in indicators and defines indicators as follows: “Indicators are specifically chosen, objective and consistent, measurable parameters that definitively mark progress towards or away from specified goals. Indicators provide evidence that a certain condition exists or certain results have or have not been achieved”. One indicator may be comprised of several parameters, and “choosing effective indicators is crucial to identify changes on all levels of Arctic biodiversity, efficiently reflecting in simple terms the complexity and settings of the different phenomena”. The CBMP is coordinating Arctic biodiversity indicators based on those chosen for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Ramsar Convention and other global processes5.
Indicator selection was initiated in a workshop in Cambridge in September 2005. The first step was to identify which data sets exist, if there were champions of these data and if the data would be available for the CBMP. This exercise produced an initial draft list of indicators. The procedure for the initial steps was as follows:
    • Brainstorm data series, champions etc.
    • Apply criteria
    • Initial draft list of indicators
    • Priority setting
    • Final draft list of indicators + technical backgrounders
Funding
As mentioned previously, all AC Working Groups are mainly funded by the participating nations “in kind” contributions. Except for the funding from Canada, some limited external engagements on specific small parts of the program and some possible funds within the Canadian IPY budget, the efforts to locate sufficient external funds have had little success to date. A donors workshop will be held in Washington DC later in the year. 
There is a widespread sentiment among many CAFF countries and participants that allocation of some project funds for immediate funding of good, necessary and cost-effective small pilot projects would allow CAFF to do more with less effort, and that the lack of such funds is inhibiting progress. 
Data management
The CBMP has its own data management task team, which by April 2007 will have completed the first version of its data management strategy. As the CBMP is in its initial phase, not fully implemented and there are little or no data to manage so far, it’s premature to assess pros and cons with this strategy.
Implementation and results
The program is still mainly under development and there are no substantial results or implementation of results to learn from. An executive summary of the CBMP Implementation Plan will be submitted to Senior Arctic Officials in April 2007. Implementation of the CBMP will reach full-scale as funding is acquired.
Challenges
    • Main challenge are to identify and maintain long-term circumpolar time series.
    • Having a proper focus on adjacent areas and mechanisms (e.g. migrating species) that can transfer pressures or effects of pressures elsewhere into the Antarctic environment.
    • Establishing sufficient funds to enable a smooth program implementation, i.e. funds for pilot projects and necessary supportive research.
AMAP
Program organization
Similar to the CAFF Working Group, the AMAP Working Group has participants from the eight Arctic countries and six indigenous organizations. In addition AMAP has a number of observers from other nations and organizations6. An AMAP Assessment Steering Group coordinates all work associated with the preparations of assessments.
AMAP is more a process than a static program. At present there are five expert groups, comprised of experts from all participating nations, which have the continuous task to synthesize ongoing research within each nation. Each of the expert groups is lead by two AC countries.

AMAP Expert Group
Lead countries
Climate, UV and ozone
Norway and USA
Human health assessment
Denmark and Canada
Radioactivity
Norway and Russia
Persistent organic pollutants
Canada and Sweden
Mercury (and other heavy metals)
Canada and Denmark

The main function of these expert groups is to prepare the AMAP scientific assessments and to advice the AMAP Working Group on necessary revisions to the monitoring program. Assessments have been both of the comprehensive type (2002) and more focused work (fact sheets and reports), e.g. brominated flame retardants (2005).
Program strategy
AMAP monitoring activities are based, to the greatest extent possible, on ongoing national and international monitoring and research. AMAP has a strategic aim to harmonize this work and where necessary promote new activities to fill identified gaps.
Selection of indicators
AMAP prefers not to use the term “indicator”, but refers to “parameters”. The parameter is referring more directly to what is actually measured, whereas an indicator could be comprised of several parameters. Selection of parameters (chemicals, media and species) to fulfill the monitoring objectives of AMAP has been done in two major processes. The first process was in 1990-19927 (workshop in Oslo 1990), with a revision carried out in 1997-19988 (workshop in Alaska 1998). After 1998 the trend- and effects-programs have been updated based on suggestions from within the AMAP expert groups.
The selection is based on the desire to monitor both trends and effects. As a consequence the same chemical could be measured in different species in some areas. Measurements of the same compounds by different scientists in different areas represent one of the larger problems in the AMAP program. The lack of adequate standardization of methods consequently will make a lot of data incomparable and “non-poolable”. 
Funding
The primary funding of the program is, similar to CAFF, expected to be taken care of within national programs. The AMAP Secretariat has some limited funds, enabling the Secretariat to initialize small projects and activities without having to feed suggestions and proposals through a painstaking and time-consuming administrative process.
Data management
AMAP has established Thematic Data Centers (TDCs) with the objectives to:
    • provide access to data from recent monitoring and research activities
    • provide a means to ensure that data are treated in a consistent manner
    • begin the process of establishing a long-term archive of monitoring data for the Arctic

The TDCs would also give easy access to thematic summaries and ensure swift and easy production of overviews of recent monitoring data. 
The TDCs have not worked the way they were intended. It would appear that the procedures associated with the use of the TDCs do not satisfy the individual scientists’ need to be reassured about the secure management of their own monitoring or research data. 
The marine TDC, located at ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), has had particular problems with the conversion of data from individual scientists to the common format required by the TDC. There are at present new initiatives underway that hopefully will improve this part of the AMAP data management procedure.
Implementation and results
AMAP has had a large impact factor due to the quality, timing and accessibility (readability) of their assessments.
Results from AMAP has been high-impact input for the design and implementation of international conventions fighting pollution (e.g. LRTAP9 and Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants).
Challenges
Achieve standardization of methods between measurements of pollutant levels.
Relate to issues of climate change and biodiversity.
Modeling of pollutant transport and effects on different scales.
CAFF/AMAP harmonizing
In the SAO Report to Minsters from the 2002 meeting of the Senior Arctic Officials (SAOs) in Inari, Finland, it was explicitly stated that the SAOs wanted CAFF and AMAP to work together and to harmonize a monitoring program10. There are extensive synergies to get from such a harmonization, and this was further emphasized in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA).
A common strategy was published in 2004 as a CAFF/AMAP report, focusing on potential synergies and what actions need to be taken to achieve these synergies11. As follow-up to this publication, a “green paper” is now being prepared that sets out to define in more detail the common ground for a JMP (= Joint Monitoring Program) between the two AC Working Groups (which means coordination between no less than 16 national governmental agencies in eight countries, as well as six indigenous peoples organizations). As part of the “green paper”, each country of the AC is submitting a list of the major ongoing monitoring programs that are related to the CAFF and/or AMAP mandates. 
It is hoped that building on the existing programs and locating potential synergies will help facilitate the process. It is highly ambitious to have as a goal circumpolar joint monitoring, and it has proven to be more difficult to implement than originally thought. Nevertheless, there seems to be a fundamental belief within the programs’ organizations that such a joint program is one of the strongest steps the AC can take in understanding the drivers and effects of global change.
F. Lessons learned
There are different ways in which to set out to plan and implement environmental monitoring programs. One can start out with defining program objectives and start planning the program in an ideal way, not considering future funding and consequently the real possibilities for being able to continue the monitoring program in the long-term. Another approach is to first find out what good data sets are “out there”, preferably already funded within existing programs, nationally or regionally, and then implement and secure these monitoring activities as real and good-quality continuing data series, which will be able to tell us about change the way we want to. 
Too many monitoring programs have made the same mistake, starting with designing and planning a program from an ideal perspective (beginning to end), then when funds often prove to be inadequate, being forced to start cutting in the plan for activities. This seldom produces good monitoring programs, and severely reduces the quality of what the program can tell us in the end. 
Although monitoring programs and activities need clear objectives, it is important that the process prepares to make data inventory in an initial phase to ensure the inclusion of important and long-term funded data series. Time series of good quality are rare, and they have the potential to detect small changes over a short period. Thus, a failure to agree on common monitoring objectives shouldn’t prevent implementation of such data series and give them the support they need to be maintained, until the monitoring objectives have been agreed upon by all participants.
Program organization
    • Essential to establish a strong and competent program governing entity to ensure progress in all parts of the program.
Program strategy
    • Secure long-term monitoring.
    • Suggested new activities must primarily be funded through existing or new national programs.
    • There should be a strategy and a process for communication of results to the public and stakeholders.
    • Agree on common definitions and implementation strategies for ambiguous terminology.
    • Run pilot projects to test parameters/indicators, methodologies and long-term strategies.
    • Ensure harmonization with relevant international conventions and agreements.
Selection of indicators
    • Ensure continuity of participating experts under program development to avoid repetitions of work.
    • Make comprehensive and real inventories of existing data and data champions.
    • Agree on an inventory list for applicable methods.
Funding
    • Allocate funds for pilot projects and small but essential program elements, such as development of databases and “on the fly” ad hoc-projects etc.
    • The backbone of the program and its organization needs to be funded by government. Research projects can attract funds, but the central coordinating and communicating role is seen as governmental and can’t compete with research projects for funds.
    • Develop clear and nation-wise implementation plans to facilitate the process to get national funding.
Data management
    • Goal to have easy access to a broad and updated pool of data for easy production of overviews.
    • Ensure proper procedures for handling primary data to ensure cooperation and dedication from owners of data.
Outreach/communication
    • Ensure strong emphasis on good-quality and focused communication of results to the public, stakeholders and decision-makers. Many monitoring studies suffer from a lack of good communication.
Standardization and harmonization between programs
    • All contributing programs must be harmonized, and methods standardized, to allow pooling of results and activities.
G. Conclusion
Monitoring in the Arctic vs the Antarctic
In many ways the grand picture of monitoring in the Antarctica is different, maybe simpler, due to lack of main pressure factors such as e.g. oil and gas developments and most sources of local and acute pollution. Due to differences in prevailing ocean and atmospheric currents long-range transportation of pollutants are also much less of a problem in Antarctica than in the Arctic. Permanent human settlements, not including research stations, are absent in the bigger picture, thus monitoring programs do not have to integrate humans and consequently issues regarding human health. However, Antarctica consists of vast areas that are in even less proximity of human settlements than in the Arctic, and that consequently seem even less accessible than most of the Arctic.
The Antarctic territories are enormous, and it will be impossible to monitor everything. Thus, when setting out to monitor the Antarctic environment, some specific areas, species and/or processes must be chosen. In this respect the Antarctic is similar to the Arctic or any other area. And thus the appropriation of the most suitable and previously tested methods, procedures and experiences for design and implementation of environmental monitoring programs will possibly be even more important in Antarctica than anywhere else.
Another major difference between Antarctica and the Arctic is that in the Antarctic there is an agreed to common environmental framework governing activities, which is not the case in the Arctic. Already sanctioned environmental goals, legislation and organizational processes can simplify the road towards a coordinated environmental monitoring framework, but there are still many of the same challenges to be tackled in order to develop scientifically sound, robust and long-lasting coordinated monitoring.
Main lessons
The points mentioned in the previous chapter are all considered to be vital for the successful design and implementation of an environmental monitoring program in Antarctica. Monitoring activities have been in operation in the Arctic for decades and the lessons learned are often expensive.
    1. The main lesson that can be learned from the Arctic is that in order to identify and establish a framework for coordinated monitoring in Antarctica it is essential to ensure that there is a clear organizational (expert) structure behind the process. The complexity and need for continuous focus when designing, establishing and implementing such programs is paramount. Neither the CEP itself or the ICGs it has established have provided for the stability and required platform needed to conduct the necessary expert discussions. The CEP should therefore consider establishing a permanent group with the mandate to develop and implement a coordinated monitoring framework for Antarctica. 
    2. It is furthermore essential that a coordinated monitoring framework in the first instance builds on already existing monitoring activity. The first task for such a group should therefore be to make inventories of existing monitoring activities, to fine-tune the overall monitoring objectives and to define ambiguous terms and terminology. Disagreements on the meaning and use of terms and terminology always have the potential to diverge any discussion and lead to time-consuming and exhausting dead ends.
    3. After relating existing activities to the main objectives, thereby revealing gaps, one should initiate a selection process for indicators and/or parameters. It is of vital importance that there is a maintained focus on standardized and harmonized methods throughout the process.
    4. Once a monitoring program is implemented, there has to be a well-designed strategy for regular assessments, presentations of results and public outreach. This will ensure good communication of status and trends of the Antarctic environment, and secure a good foundation of the program within the participating nations. 
    5. Finally, as environmental monitoring programs in the Arctic are continuously developed and implemented, a permanent Antarctic monitoring group is well advised to keep updated with the state-of-the-art in the Arctic and maybe even establish an arena for regular updates and discussions with the Arctic programs. This could be advantageous for all programs.
