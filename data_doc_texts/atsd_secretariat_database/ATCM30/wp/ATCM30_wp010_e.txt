Intersessional CEP Consideration of Draft Management Plans
Working Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection by Australia
Summary
The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) has repeatedly discussed the need for an effective intersessional process for reviewing draft Management Plans. This paper identifies the desirable characteristics of such a process and proposes Terms of Reference for a standing group that could operate intersessionally to provide advice to proponents and to the CEP. 
Background
Since its first meeting in 1998 the CEP has discussed the need to improve its procedures for reviewing new and revised Management Plans (see Appendix 1 for a summary of these discussions). Good progress has been made, including: 
    • adoption of a documented process for the CEP’s consideration of draft Management Plans – the Guidelines for CEP Consideration of New and Revised Draft Management Plans for Protected Areas (2000, and revised in 2003);
    • agreement of Terms of Reference for an Intersessional Contact Group to consider draft Management Plans (Annex 4 to CEP VII Final Report, 2004); and
    • establishment of an online Discussion Forum, accessible by all CEP Members and Observers, for the intersessional review of draft Management Plans.
Recent discussions of the CEP’s roles and responsibilities (“must do tasks”) in the context of strategic planning have restated a need for further improvements. Reasons include that:
    • considerable meeting time is still taken up with the presentation and discussion of draft Management Plans – over the past five years each CEP meeting has considered on average 12 Working Papers and nearly 19 draft Management Plans per meeting (see Appendix 2);
    • while the online Discussion Forum has been useful in facilitating open and transparent consideration of draft Management Plans, the practice of establishing individually-convened intersessional contact groups (ICGs) does not promote consistency between Management Plans; 
    • participation in Management Plan ICGs has been limited (see Appendix 3); 
    • the increasing number of protected and managed areas will see an accompanying increase in the number of Management Plans due for five-yearly review under Article 6 of Annex V – at present there are between five and 20 draft plans due for review each year over the next five years, and nine plans overdue for review (see Appendix 4).
A coordinated intersessional process to review draft Management Plans
The formation of a sub-group has been repeatedly discussed as a potential solution to the issues listed above. Most recently, the Workshop on Antarctica’s Future Environmental Challenges (June 2006) reiterated that “[e]stablishment of a Standing Group on Area Protection and Management to consider management plans” was an issue requiring immediate attention by the CEP.
Australia proposes the establishment of a coordinated intersessional process to review draft Management Plans, supported by a standing group.
Desirable characteristics
Drawing on ideas raised in earlier CEP discussions, Australia proposes that an effective process for intersessional review of draft Management Plans would:
    1) involve a centrally coordinated review of all draft Management Plans;
    2) operate in accordance with Terms of Reference agreed by the CEP, using:
    • an agreed convenor and a core group of CEP representatives; and
    • relevant expertise and the services of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, as required;
    3) provide the opportunity for all CEP Members and Observers to comment on all draft Management Plans;
    4) provide proponents with practical feedback (including suggested improvements) on:
    • the suitability of management measures proposed for the Area in question;
    • consistency (in style, format and content) with other Management Plans; and
    • the contribution of proposed areas to the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole; and
    5) improve the efficiency of CEP meetings by replacing detailed consideration of each draft Management Plan with consideration of the recommendations arising from a coordinated intersessional review. 
Proposed operation
Standing group membership
A group consisting of around six CEP representatives would reflect the average level of past participation in ICGs. Article 6 of Annex V requires SCAR to be included in the review of draft Management Plans, so the inclusion of a SCAR representative on the group is desirable.

To ensure consistency between Management Plans from year to year, it would be preferable for a standing group to stagger its membership (e.g. with terms of two to three years). The CEP should agree a process for nominating and appointing a group convenor – possibly a Vice-chair – who would manage the appointment and replacement of other members. 
Status of the standing group
There are some issues about the status of such a group under the CEP’s Rules of Procedure. In particular, there is a question about whether such a body must operate in all official languages of the CEP. That issue extends beyond a proposal relating to a sub-group for Management Plans, and is not one that this paper attempts to solve. An intersessional process involving a standing group would remain open-ended, in a similar manner to the current ICG approach, so that all CEP Members and Observers would still have an opportunity to provide input. A standing group would not have authority to make decisions on behalf of the CEP, only to make recommendations, and any Member or Observer would have the opportunity during the CEP meeting to raise issues not adequately addressed during the intersessional review.
Method of operation
A variety of arrangements could be made for centrally-coordinated discussion, including physical meetings, email and use of the online Discussion Forum, depending on the composition of the standing group, the location and timing of intersessional CEP workshops, and the number of draft Management Plans to be reviewed. The standing group convenor could annually determine the most practical arrangements in consultation with other members. A possible timeline of events (without specific dates) is given at Appendix 5.
CEP procedures and guidelines
Any changes to the current method of reviewing draft Management Plans may need to be reflected in CEP procedures and guidelines, including the Guidelines for CEP Consideration of New and Revised Draft ASPA and ASMA Management Plans.
Proposed terms of reference 
    1) In consultation with relevant experts, examine any draft new or revised Management Plan to consider:
    • whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol, particularly Articles 3, 4 and 51, and with relevant CEP guidelines;2
    • its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness;3
    • whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation;4 and
    • whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole. 5
    2) Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.
    3) Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management Plan.
Other possible tasks 
    • Consider proposals for additions to the list of Historic Sites and Monuments.
    • Consider new and revised Site Guidelines.
    • Advise the CEP on procedures and guidelines for the identification, designation and management of ASPAs, ASMAs and HSMs.
    • Undertake a gap analysis based on the values for site protection identified in Article 3 of Annex V, in order to make recommendations for new protected areas.6
    • Provide advice on updating existing Management Plans, noting that Article 6 of Annex V requires the review, not necessarily the revision, of Management Plans every 5 years.
    • Consult with CCAMLR on procedures for consideration of protected areas with marine components.
Recommendations
That the CEP:
    1) agree to establish a coordinated intersessional process to review draft Management Plans, supported by a standing group;
    2) develop Terms of Reference for a Management Plans standing group;
    3) appoint a convenor and invite representatives to nominate to participate in the standing group; and
    4) invite the standing group to advise the CEP of its proposed methods of operation.

Appendix 1. Summary of CEP discussions on the need for an improved process to review draft Management Plans
1997 (ATCM XXI)
“The meeting agreed that a workshop should be convened…to… [TOR 4] examine, and where possible identify ways to improve the procedures for developing and reviewing proposals for ASPAs” (ATCM XXI Final Report, para 60).
1998 (1st Antarctic Protected Areas Workshop)
“That the CEP consider establishing a sub-group(s) to address elements of the protected areas system, and select appropriate convenors for such sub-groups” (ATCM XXII/WP26, Recommendation 8).
“That the CEP should examine the timelines for the submission and processing of proposed management plans with a view to improving the process, where possible” (ATCM XXII/WP26, Recommendation 10).
1998 (CEP I)
“The Committee recommended that a second [Antarctic protected areas] workshop be convened…to [TOR 4] suggest how the CEP could best review draft management plans for ASPAs and assist proposers in developing plans” (CEP I Final Report, para 49).
1999 (2nd Protected Areas Workshop)
“The workshop noted a need to consider the content and effectiveness of existing management plans in a consistent manner as well as how the CEP could best review draft management plans for ASPAs and assist proposers in developing plans. It is recommended that… [a] Contact Group  should be established  by the CEP, in accordance with Rule 9 of the CEP Rules of Procedure with  the following functions:
Provision of advice to proponents and the CEP on new management plans.
Reminding proponents when revisions to existing plans are due.
Provision of advice on such revisions.
Monitoring the operation of plans and advising the CEP / Parties accordingly as requested by CEP” (ATCM XXIII/WP37, Recommendation 5).
1999 (CEP II)
“It was agreed to establish an open-ended intersessional contact group to report back to CEP III on how to use and build on the outcomes and recommendations of the second Protected Areas Workshop in the implementation of Annex V of the Protocol… [including – TOR 2] to consider further ways that the CEP might most effectively develop advice on proposed and revised management plans for specially protected areas …” (CEP II Final Report, para 80).
2000 (ICG)
“A process for CEP consideration of draft plans was suggested by some contact points whereby draft management plans for protected areas are provided to the CEP Chair before the CEP meeting (CEP N) ahead of the meeting at which the plan would be formally tabled (CEP N+1)” (SATCM XII/WP 12).
2000 (CEP III)
“It was agreed that separate open-ended intersessional working groups would be the best way of considering draft Management Plans. The proponent of the plan would normally act as convenor of the group. SCAR, COMNAP and CCAMLR confirmed their willingness to take part in such intersessional work. The Committee agreed to procedures to be followed when a draft management plan is submitted to the Committee [“Guidelines for CEP Consideration of New and Revised Draft Management Plans for Protected Areas” - Annex 4]” (CEP III Final Report, para 85).
2003 (CEP VI)
“The CEP agreed to the revised “Guidelines for CEP Consideration of New and Revised ASPA and ASMA Management Plans [Annex 4]” (CEP VI Final Report, para 140).
2004 (CEP VII)
“The Committee noted that a centrally coordinated approach [to assessment of management plans] may provide the benefits suggested by the UK paper, provided that clear terms of reference were established, that participation was open-ended, and the system was easy to use and manage. [TOR at Annex 4]” (CEP VII Final Report, paras 11, 12).
2005 (CEP VIII)
“In respect of Protected Area Management Plans, there was recognition of the continually increasing workload, and the need to ensure effective consideration of the documents by the CEP.  It was suggested that the Management Plans could be examined by a specific group, who would then provide advice to the CEP in considering their recommendations to the ATCM” (CEP VIII Final Report, Annex 5).
2005 (CEP VIII)
“A structured approach to our business: efficient, targeted, transparent… standing groups to address routine issues, eg management plans” (CEP VIII Final Report, Annex 6).
2006 (CEP “Futures” Workshop)
“Establish a Standing Group on Area Protection and Management to consider management plans”, “Standing Group to develop terms of reference and a work plan” (ATCM XXIX/WP42).
