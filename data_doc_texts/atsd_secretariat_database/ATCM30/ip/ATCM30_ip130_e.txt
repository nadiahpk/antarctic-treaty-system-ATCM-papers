Minsk
April, 2007


With the purpose of the further integration into world scientific community and participations in processes of the international scientific cooperation on studying polar regions of the Earth by Byelorussia a number of practical actions is undertaken:
    •  The Рresident of Byelorussia on July, 17th, 2006 signs the Law on connection of our republic to the Contract about Antarctic 1959,
    •  On December, 27th, 2006 the  Contract has come into force for Byelorussia;
    •  The states-depositary  in April, 2007 to Byelorussia had been directed authentic texts of the international Contracts, now there is begun process of their ratification;
    •  On August, 31st, 2006 the decision of Ministerial council of Byelorussia had been approved the State aim program « Monitoring of polar areas of the Earth and maintenance of activity of the Arctic and Antarctic expeditions on 2007 - 2010 and for the period up to 2015 ».
The state aim  program includes both actually scientific researches, and the sections connected with forwarding logistical service of works of national Belarus polar expeditions.
The purpose of the State aim program on 2006 - 2010 and for the period up to 2015 is expansion of scientific researches and monitoring of a condition of an environment of polar regions of the Earth directed on reception by Byelorussia of the status of the equal in rights participant of world process in research of high-altitude areas of the Earth, maintenance of its long-term scientific interests in polar areas, performance of the international obligations by complex use of available intellectual, financial and material resources of the interested ministries and departments of Byelorussia.
 The Primary goals of realization of the State aim program at the first stage of its realization are:
    • creation of the first Belarus Antarctic station equipped by the modern process equipment and devices of scientific supervision of domestic and leading foreign manufacturers;
    • Creation of system of monitoring of a condition of an environment of polar areas of the Earth;
    • Reception of modern practical experience of maintenance of activity of long-term polar expeditions;
    • Approbation and pre-production operation in extreme conditions of the newest technics, devices, product samples and materials of domestic manufacturers;
    • Skilled introduction progressive saving up energy technologies and use of renewed energy sources;
    • The complex decision of problems of ecological character;
    • Development and strengthening of the international cooperation in sphere of studying of polar areas of the Earth;
    • Preparation of the professional staff for Belarus wintering and seasonal expeditions.
The state customer of the State aim program is the Ministry of natural resources and protection of the environment of Byelorussia.
The state program consists of three blocks including seven tasks.
Block I Development and use ground, lidar and space devices and methods of monitoring of a condition of an atmosphere and a spreading surface in Antarctic.
The task 1. System engineering instrument mathematical and the software of remote satellite and ground monitoring of a condition of a snow cover, atmospheric an aerosol and clouds in Antarctica and methods of external calibration of optical tools.
The task 2. Completion and manufacturing of a measuring instrument of the general maintenance of ozone "PEONY" and improvement spectroradiometr "PEONY-Тх" for the organization of monitoring of an ozone cloud of polar areas of the Earth.
The task 3. Development of a radar-tracking complex undersurface  sounding for monitoring a snow-ice cover and geological structures in polar areas of the Earth.
The task 4. Creation of system of hydrometeorological supervision and measurements, and also supervision over a condition of an environment in areas of basing of the Belarus polar stations (a complex of supervision over a condition of an environment).
The block II Geophysical and geochemical researches lytosphera:
The task 5. Carrying out of geophysical and geochemical researches in areas of basing of the Belarus polar stations (a complex of geomagnetic, seismic and geochemical supervision).
The block III Biological resources of Antarctic and technology of maintenance of ability to live of the person in extreme conditions.
The task 6. An estimation of prospects of use of renewed alive sea resources of Antarctic in areas of basing of the Belarus polar stations.
 The task 7.   Development of ways of correction Mental and physiological frustration of an organism of the person in conditions of action extreme climatic and geophysical  natural factors.
Carrying out of complex researches by Byelorussia in Arctic regions and Antarctic and as realization of forwarding activity initially communicate our country with the decision of problems of ecological character:
    • Ratification Madrid « the Report on preservation of the environment of Antarctic » and other international Contracts; 
    • Training the personnel of expeditions to modern norms and rules of behaviour in Arctic regions and Antarctic;
    • Development and the organization of regular measurements and supervision over a condition of an environment in area of action of the Belarus polar stations;
    • Construction, repair and arrangement of warehouses of mineral oil at polar stations according to positions Madrid « the Report on preservation of the environment of Antarctic », other documents of the international ecological right;
    • Removal of a different sort of the rests of the hydrocarbonic connections accumulating at polar stations, by their casing in special capacities and export on continent;
    • The equipment of items of maintenance service and repair of forwarding technics by systems of gathering and waste disposal with the purpose of exception of their harmful influence on an environment;
    • Application at polar stations and at carrying out of polar expeditions of ecologically safe containers for transportation in polar areas and back materials and the substances carried to group especially controllable and dangerous;
    • Designing at construction of polar stations of modern ecological complexes for processing firm waste, burning of dust, sewage treatment, and also warehouses for temporary storage of the waste which are a subject export for limits of polar areas.
Byelorussia makes the first practical steps on a way of the organization and carrying out of polar researches:
    • in February - April, 2006 two observers from Byelorussia onboard  "Academician Fedorov" have made a trip to Antarctic for acquaintance with modern methods of the organization and carrying out of the Antarctic expeditions;
During since November 2006 till April, 2007 two representatives of Byelorussia in structure of 52 Russian Antarctic expeditions have carried out forwarding researches on Enderby land in a geographical complex Hills Talla. Which included preliminary works in the given geographical complex, daily two urgent meteorological supervision, monitoring of an ozone cloud of an atmosphere with use modified ozonometr М-124 and as, studying ecological conditions in the given region has been lead.
Byelorussia understanding importance of scientific Antarctic researches and the contribution of these researches to development of a human society, wishing to strengthen cooperation in the field of a science and technics and as preservations of the environment of Antarctic, expresses the readiness for cooperation with all countries participants of the Contract about Antarctic and the international organizations in strict conformity with spirit and principles of the given Contract.
