IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism
2006-2007 Antarctic Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Introduction
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2006-2007 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. Due to the early timing of this meeting, IAATO anticipates completing a revision of this paper in the coming months. This, and additional information will be posted on www.iaato.org in due course. Preliminary information presented here is based on the best available knowledge at the time this document was prepared. 
With a view to improving the accuracy of this information further, IAATO would again like to make a formal request to all National Authorities to request the use of the standard Post Visit Report Form where appropriate and for IAATO to receive copies of these forms whenever possible for all expeditions engaged in tourist-related activities for inclusion in the database. This will allow an accurate reflection of overall numbers; compilations of detailed tourism data on all landing sites; and assist in compiling data for use in furthering the understanding of any potentially resulting cumulative impacts from these activities. This request has been made at previous ATCM’s and IAATO is pleased to note that some forms have been forthcoming, but is aware that the current database record is still not complete. 

1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As with the 16 past seasons, IAATO membership continues to incorporate the majority of all Antarctic tour operators. This season the membership accounted for over 90% of all known operators. 
A summary of IAATO Member activities follows:
    • 908 clients participated in land-based expeditions.
    • 24,296 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area. Of this total:
    • 23,545 passengers landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area
    • 623 passengers landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica
    • 128 passengers sailed aboard small sailing vessels and/or yachts in the Antarctic Peninsula.
    • 174 passengers participated in air/cruise voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula area and flew from South America to King George Island to embark a vessel and sail for six days, making landings.
    • 6,930 passengers traveled aboard large cruise vessels that were cruise-only (and did not land in the Antarctic Treaty Area).
    • 360 passengers participated in over-flights from South America to the Antarctic Peninsula area aboard aircraft.
    • 686 passengers participated in over-flights to Antarctica from Australia.
    • All operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National authority.  

1.2 Non-IAATO Operator’s Activities

IAATO understands that for those involved in both the management and regulation of Antarctic tourism, there is immense value in the maintenance of a single comprehensive database of all tourist-related activities. To this end, IAATO strives to incorporate as detailed information as is available in this report. The Association would welcome any information on non-IAATO tourist-related activities for inclusion in this database. 
    • 4,152 passengers traveled aboard 4 non-IAATO-operated vessels or aircraft, landing passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula area. 
    • An unknown number of passengers traveled on small sailing vessels/yachts and private motor yachts, a number of which were understood to be un-authorized. Information pertaining to any of these vessels has not as yet been provided by either the vessel operators or, where authorized, National authorities.
    • Government-supported tourist-related activities on ships and aircraft occurred, but information has not been provided to IAATO for activities departing from South Africa and South America, so this information has not been included in this report.
    • 9 tourists participated in a program offered by Uruguay at Artigas Station. Uruguay kindly advised IAATO of its activities.
    • Both private and commercial activities were conducted where Advance Notification and Post Visit Reports had been filed through National Authorities.  To date, only limited information has been forwarded to IAATO for inclusion in this report. IAATO would however be pleased to receive any such Post Visit Reports for inclusion in the tourism database. 
    • Several countries did not require Environmental Impact Assessments and/or Post Visit Site Reports from commercial tourist operations to report on their activities. IAATO has not been given any detailed information regarding these tourist activities.  IAATO would be pleased to receive any detailed data on these tourist operations for inclusion in the database. 

1.3   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities 
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B., Naiad, hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for a minimum of seven years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the 1960’s. 
A brief summary of the season, including an "Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2006-2007,” and “IAATO Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism 2007-2008,” are appended as Appendix A and Appendix C, respectively, which provide further details of the operators (IAATO and non-IAATO), vessels, activities and numbers. The histogram in Appendix B illustrates estimated and actual tourism figures for seaborne and land-based passengers as compiled since the 1992-1993 season.
Based on information returned to IAATO in annual reports or in the Post Visit Reports from the 2006-2007 season it is estimated that at least 29,522 passengers landed in the Antarctic on private sector seaborne and land-based expeditions. 
Most, but not all, commercial tour companies during the 2006-2007 season were located in the States of Contracting Parties.


 2.0 Commercial Seaborne Tourism – IAATO Members and non-Members of IAATO
2.1	Seasonal Estimates
While the information given below is an accurate reflection of the data available IAATO cautions users who compare data from year to year to look at the annual list of individual vessels and compare it to reports from Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties’ exchange of information.
IAATO can account for 28,531 passengers landed in the Antarctic Treaty Area from 48 commercially-organized tour vessels and small sailing vessels and/or yachts who reported their activities from October 2006 to March 2007. This number includes Members and non-IAATO members. This represents a 14% increase over the 2005-2006 season where a total of 25,167 ship-based passengers were reported traveling aboard 44 commercially-organized tour vessels and small sailing vessels and/or yachts. 
IAATO Members operated all but four of the tour vessels that sailed during the 2006–2007 season. Since 2001, IAATO’s Bylaws have stated that IAATO vessels carrying more than 500 passengers cannot land passengers ashore and that stringent landing restrictions are placed on vessels carrying more than 200 passengers at specific landing sites due to environmental considerations. Three of the vessels capable of carrying more than 500 passengers operated by non-IAATO Members landed passengers; only one regularly landed more than 500 passengers. These companies do not intend to join IAATO.

Note: Table 1 is based on data provided by companies who submitted Post Visit Reports and from other sources where available.

The vast majority of commercially-operated voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from late October to March), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from Stanley, Punta Arenas, Puerto Williams, Puerto Montt, Valparaiso, Puerto Madryn, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. 
The five large cruise vessels (Deutschland, Golden Princess, Rotterdam, Prinsendam, and Crystal Serenity) operated by IAATO Members who each carry more than 500 passengers and conducted cruise-only operations visited the Antarctica Peninsula area for approximately 72-96 hours on each voyage and carried a total of 6,930 passengers.

2.3	Commercial Antarctic Small Sailing Vessel and/or Private Luxury Yacht Activities including those operated by non-IAATO Members
Based on information received from IAATO Member yachts it is known that at least 128 passengers were reported to have traveled to the Antarctic Treaty Area aboard 10 or more commercially-operated small sailing vessels and/or private yachts during the 2006-2007 season. For non-Member vessels this information may be found under the Exchange of Information submitted by each Antarctic Treaty Party who permits or authorizes the vessel or company. 
	IAATO Commercial Small Sailing Vessels and/or Yachts with fare-paying passengers include Pelagic, Pelagic Australis, Golden Fleece, Tooluka, Australis, Le Sourire, Santa Maria Australis, Seal  and Vaihéré.

A partial list of non-Member Private Luxury Yachts, small ships and/or Small Sailing Vessels visiting Antarctica during the 2006-2007 season include: Abel Tasman, Patagonia Ice Lady, Octopus, Celtic Spirit, Sadko, Commitment, Sarah Vorwerk, Spirit of Sydney, Valhalla, Whale Song and others. Not all vessels were permitted, authorized, or aware of the need to have applied for permission to their respective national authority.  IAATO received Post Visit Report Forms from Octopus, Sadko and Spirit of Sydney only.


3.0 	Activities Conducted from Expedition Cruise Vessels
All activities are approved through the Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documentation submitted in advance of the season to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
3.1	Camping in the Peninsula
Six IAATO Members conducting traditional seaborne tourism to the Antarctic Peninsula offered short overnight stays in conjunction with the cruise. Camping provides an excellent opportunity for tourists to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica, separate from being on the ship. Guides accompany each group ashore. This activity has taken place for at least ten years in the Peninsula region. 
Campsites are generally located at least 450 ft. (150 m) from nesting birds, including penguins, and located on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites, or organic debris might be covered. Each campsite is used for no more than a few nights per season. Toilets are generally taken ashore; human waste is returned to the ship and meals are eaten only on board the ship.
	
3.2	Climbing and Kayaking from Ships in the Peninsula Area
Nine companies offered climbing and/or kayaking. Climbing and kayaking have proven to be successful activities for more than ten years in the Antarctic Peninsula area. 
3.3       SCUBA Diving
Four companies offered SCUBA diving. Scuba diving has taken place for at least eight years.
3.4       Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
An ROV has been used by one IAATO Member for over five years. The ROV is used for educational purposes. Video footage is taken by the ROV and aired aboard ship for passengers to be able to experience first-hand the underwater sea life. One private IAATO non-Member vessel also used a ROV.
3.5        Helicopter Operations 
Helicopter operations were conducted by one IAATO Member during the 2006-2007 season. One private IAATO non-Member vessel also completed helicopter flights. Helicopter operations have taken place since the 1992-1993 season.
3.6	Hovercraft Operation
One IAATO Member used a Hovercraft in the Ross Sea area during the 2006-2007 season.

4.0	Commercial Land-based Tourism
4.1 	Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions 
IAATO member Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below) operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the 21st consecutive season. ALE carried a total of 204 clients, 50 Government and VIP personnel, accompanied by 68 staff and guides, and 18 air crew. 

ALE employs experienced staff and guides, many of whom have worked previously at Patriot Hills and other locations to be visited (90% of all staff have previous Antarctic experience). Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies, and ensure their implementation in Antarctica. 

Activities included the operation of standard programs, organization and operation of expeditions, services for private expeditions and support for government activities. ALE’s operations included the following:

Aircraft Operations:
    • One Ilyushin-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, fuel, staff, guides and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills on a total of sixteen flights.
    • Two ski-equipped Twin-Otter aircraft were used for flights in Antarctica and to support medical evacuation throughout the Antarctic season. 

Patriot Hills Camp:
    • Patriot Hills Camp opened 06 November 2006 and closed 01 February 2007.

Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) were again deployed at locations up to 200km inland from Patriot Hills to provide weather data.

4.1.2a Government Activity Supported by ALE
Requests from National Operators, research institutes and government agencies resulted in ALE providing support for up to 50 scientists and logistic staff and a considerable number of flights. Research groups, government representatives and their logistic support visited Patriot Hills and were accommodated at the camp for various periods. ALE hosted visitors from British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Korean Polar Research Institute (KORDI), FACH (Chile Airforce), Ejercito de Chile (Chilean Army), and Russian Federation.

On behalf of the Polar Foundation, Moscow, ALE in conjunction with the British Antarctic Survey and the National Science Foundation, supported an official Russian government expedition to the Geographic South Pole specifically organized for Dr. A. N. Chilingarov (Deputy Speaker of the Russian Duma and Russian Special Presidential Representative on International Polar Year Issues). The visit required support of ALE’s Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft, two MI-8 helicopters and an AN-74 aircraft, all of which made various landings at Patriot Hills during the expedition.

ALE supported a meteorite search organized by KORDI in the Pirrit and Martin Hills and at Moulton Escarpment, providing flight, overland and field safety support for the group. The project was successful and it is hoped that a further field visit will be made in the future.

4.1.2b  Expeditions Supported by ALE
ALE was delighted to be able to bring several of the original Vinson Massif first ascent group back to the mountain on the 40th anniversary of their ascent.

Polar First contracted ALE to provide logistic support and SAR for their second attempt on a Pole-to-Pole flight. Jennifer Murray led a successful two-helicopter flight to the South Geographic Pole, which they reached on January 6, 2007.


4.2	Air/ Land-based Activities Conducted by Aerovias DAP (IAATO Provisional Members)
In 2006-2007, there were 40 flights operated by Aerovias DAP in either a King Air or Dash 7 aircraft carrying a total of 704 clients, including station personnel on station visits and extended walks. DAP offered both a one-day flight seeing and landing at King George Island and an overnight program where clients stay on King George Island in DAP’s land-based facilities. Clients accompanied by a guide visit Frei/Marsh, Bellingshausen and Great Wall Stations, and surrounding wildlife areas if time permits. DAP also facilitated five medical evacuations for IAATO Members.

5.0	Air Operations – Overflights 
5.1  	Overflights from South America

IAATO Member LAN Airlines operated 8 overflights carrying 360 clients to the Antarctic Peninsula area in a 60-passenger capacity Boeing 737-200 during the 2006-2007 season. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers and independent travelers calling at Punta Arenas.  

The flying routes varied according to weather conditions but basically were conducted as follows:

    • From King George Island to Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and Deception Islands (South Shetland Islands) and return.
    • From King George Island and the Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell Sea (in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands) near Marambio Station and return.

Numerous overflights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate or have operated from Punta Arenas, but information on these flights prior to 2003-2004 have been difficult to obtain. 

5.2	Overflights from Australia

During the 2006-2007 season IAATO Member Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia, operated two Antarctic daytime overflights, lasting approximately 11-12 hours in duration, operating out of Australia aboard a Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the thirteenth consecutive season. 

A total of 686 clients participated in these two flights. In addition, the aircraft carried a total of 50 crew members during the season. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 81 flights carrying nearly 29,000 clients since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The flight itineraries primarily operate along the northern Victoria Land coast, and the Oates, George V and Adélie Coasts. Croydon’s staff provides a full in-flight lecture and education program utilizing at least three experienced lecturers and at least six videos. A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground-to-air interviews are conducted with staff members at Australian and occasionally at Italian bases.

6.0	Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2007-2008 Season
Appendix C illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that are expected to occur during the 2007-2008 season. This is an estimate based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat at the time this report was submitted. 

For the 2007-2008 season seaborne or ship-based tourism will once again include the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B, Naiad, hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV.
6.1	According to estimates provided to IAATO by Members and non-Members, during the 2007-2008 season 31,603 seaborne and small sailing vessels and/or yacht passengers are expected to land in Antarctica on commercially-organized tour vessels and 1,050 on land-based expeditions. Another 9,200 are anticipated on cruise-only programs and 1,100 on overflights (see Appendix C).

6.2	Activities of non-Members continue to be of concern to IAATO. Two non-members, both of which have the capacity to carry 500+ passengers plan to make landings in Antarctica over the course of 7 departures. These 7 departures by ships have the potential to land at least 500-550 passengers per voyage (as has occurred for over ten seasons). 

6.3	Aerovias DAP is planning on flying passengers from Punta Arenas to Frei/Marsh Station on King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at Frei/Marsh. In addition, there are 5 fly/cruise programs that include a flight from Punta Arenas to King George Island where passengers embark a ship (at Frei), sail and make landings in the Antarctic Peninsula for six days before flying back to Punta Arenas.

6.4	IAATO has not been informed of possible activities in Dronning Maud Land during the 2007-2008 season.

6.5	Some National Program vessels carry fare-paying passengers for tourist-related activities. National Programs are encouraged to co-ordinate with IAATO in advance of the season to ensure the principle of one ship at one site at one time. In addition they are encouraged to report their passenger numbers and activities if they are landing at typical tourist sites so IAATO can attempt to account for the “footprint” and address cumulative impact issues. 

Antarctic Tourism Trends

7.1	A trends chart showing the change in tourism from the 1992-1993 season to the 2006-2007 season can be found in Appendix B of this paper.  

7.2	The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (http://www.iaato.org) under the category of “Tourism Statistics”: 

    • Tourists by Nationality (Landed)
    • Tourists by Nationality (Air and Cruise)
    • Tourists by Nationality (All)
    • Tourist Nationalities by Vessel
    • Trends 1992-2007
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per site per vessel -- All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per Site per Vessel -- Continental Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel -- All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site per Vessel
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel -- Peninsula Sites 
    • Number of Visits per Site per Activity.

These will be posted once the statistics have been finalized.

	
8.0	Conclusion

In practice, and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether or not Members of IAATO – will be included in the exchange of emergency contact information, ship scheduling and in the reporting of tourist-related statistics. IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent so that complete and effective reporting can provide a strong base for tourism regulation by Treaty Parties and management by IAATO.
IAATO assumes that Antarctic tourism will continue to grow both in seaborne activities and to a lesser degree by land-based activities. The increase in numbers, however, does not necessarily reflect direct or significant environmental impacts. IAATO is committed to effectively managing Antarctic tourism given the yearly increase of tourism.
IAATO as an organization is focused on minimizing environmental impacts and consequently evaluates all relevant tourist activities. Despite the increase in numbers, IAATO believes that Member activities continue to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

Additional Note on Non-IAATO Vessels:

During the season there were both small and large luxury yachts that sailed to Antarctica that were not part of the IAATO network. Information on these vessels should be obtained through the Antarctic Treaty Parties Exchange of Information. A request was made for copies of the applicable Post Visit Site Reports but none have yet been received, therefore they were not included in this overview.
