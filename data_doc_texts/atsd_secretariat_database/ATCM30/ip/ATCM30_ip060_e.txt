Scientific activities around Larsemann Hills region 
Various scientific programmes have been undertaken in the fields of Earth sciences, Biological Sciences, Upper atmospheric research, limnology and oceanography in Larsemann Hills region.
Atmospheric studies 
The studies included measurement of meteorological parameters, changes in the partial pressure of the atmosphere, study of the D layer of the ionosphere and the effects of space weather on this layer, monitoring the ambient air quality of the region and total Ozone column, water vapour column and radiations at various wavelengths, variations in daily mean values of AOD and Column Water Vapour, direct   radiative Forcing due to Aerosols and Precursor Gases etc.
Ground truth radiometric data collection
 In continuation with the work carried out at Maitri station during the austral summer period, measurements of direct component of solar spectral irradiance were carried at various heights from 200 meters to 3000 meters with Narrow Band Ground Truth Radiometer (NBGTR). The data will be used in estimating total spectral radiance at the exit port of the IRS P6 AWiFS satellite sensor.
Geomagnetism
A Digital Fluxgate Magnetometer has been installed at Larsemann Hills, recording variations in the three orthogonal components of Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetometer will be operated throughout the year. The data will be used to understand the auroral current systems. Comparison of this data with that of Maitri magnetic data will provide information on movement of auroral electro jet currents and on space weather.  A GPS has been installed and will be operational throughout the year. The data will be used for atmospheric studies like Total Electron Content (TEC), Water Vapor & L Band Scintillation studies etc.
 An AWS, recording three parameters i.e. Pressure, Temperature and Humidity has also been installed with this GPS. Data are being logged at 30 sec sampling interval and will operate throughout the year. The Wind Speed and Wind Direction sensors developed a minor snag and will be added to this system during the forthcoming expedition. A magnetic survey of the area shows a significantly high magnetic anomaly along SE – NW ridge and certain pockets of this area. 
Geology
 Nine traverses across the regional tectonic grain were undertaken to cover the entire terrain and to sample and study all the lithotypes exposed. The main rock types of this area are Ortho-gneisses (migmatitic), mafic rich migmatite, amphibolitic enclaves, arenite (quartzitic) and granite. Few oriented samples were collected for AMS (Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) and related geological studies. The evidence of multiple episodes of deformation and the fold interference patterns are well documented in the region
The team also carried out a short traverse to record the radioactivity in the area (Larsemann Hills) using a hand held Scintillometer. Observed radiation levels were generally in the range of background values except some pegmatite bands. Snow samples were also collected for the chemical analysis.
Wide band magneto telluric investigation to delineate the deep crustal Conductivity structure and to compare the co-seismic activity in Antarctica was also undertaken.
Glaciology
 In order to characterize and understand the mechanisms involved in the accretion of aerosols and particles during the fresh snow deposition in coastal Antarctica, systematic sampling of surface snow was carried out in the Larsemann Hills region. 
The following radiation, snow and meteorological parameters were collected in the Larsemann area for development of algorithm and estimation of integrated albedo and snow/ice surface temperature using satellite data.   
    • Incoming solar radiation 
    • Albedo of different Snow, Ice and land area at 30 min interval 
    • Snow / Ice Surface Temperature
    • Ambient Temperature
    • Relative humidity
    • Wind Speed
    • Pressure
    • Cloud cover and cloud Type
Environmental Studies 
Studies were undertaken to collect essential base line data to fill up the areas of gaps in information
    • Sampling of lake’s surface waters and sea waters from various locations at Larsemann Hills, east Antarctica 
    • Sampling for soil and biological studies
    • Ambient air quality monitoring at two sites using High Volume Sampler (HVS), operated round the clock 
    • Bird density and diversity study
    • Survey for fecal matter of Penguins and Skuas 
    • An Aethalometer was operated to sample atmospheric aerosols at the proposed site of the new station. Atmospheric CO2 sampling was done using potassium hydroxide medium and pump assembly to obtain the baseline data. The time series observations of vertical oceanic profiles of temperature were obtained on a sunny day for characterizing changes in the upper (0-760m) water column from the stationary ship. The surface temperature change of 0.30 C has been observed between 0600 hr and 1200 hr profile. Surface cooling of about 0.50 C was observed between noon profile and 1800 hr profile. The thermocline also exhibits changes due to vertical penetration of surface heat down to about 60m. 
Palaeoclimatic studies: 
The samples were collected for pollen, diatom and other algae, clay mineralogy, chemical, C-14 dating and isotopic analysis from Glacio - lacustrine deposit from several lake sites around Larsemann Hills. 
Polar microbes
Water samples were collected after opening the frozen surface from lakes adjoining the proposed site for bacterial diversity. Seawater samples were also collected from either side of the promontory. Snow samples were collected from areas adjoining the Amery and Publications ice shelf as well as the Lambert Glacier. Bacteriological studies on snow samples would give better insights on the origin of microbes associated with volcanic ash trapped in ice.
Large-scale topographical mapping of Larsemann Hills 
A topographical map of the unnamed promontory has been completed at 1:5,000 scale with contour interval of 5 m. Additionally, another map, on 1:500 scale with contour intervals of 1 m, has also been prepared for the area where the proposed station is likely to come up. 
Hydrographic survey off Larsemann Hills: 
Ship sounding of the outer approaches of the area was carried out bounded by the following limits: -
    • 69 deg 15 min S - 69 deg 20 min S, and
    • 76 deg 10 min E - 76 deg 20 min E
The area was surveyed on a scale of 1: 50,000.  Sounding lines were run 250 meters apart and two cross lines were run 4000 meters apart.
