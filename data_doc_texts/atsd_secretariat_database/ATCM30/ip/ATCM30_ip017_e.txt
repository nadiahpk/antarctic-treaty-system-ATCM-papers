Annual Report of China Pursuant to Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty




Annual Report of China Pursuant to Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
1. Notification of measures taken pursuant to Article 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Environmental Protocol
Although there is no domestic legislation enacted to implement the Protocol at the present time, we work fully to follow the Protocol through the whole procedure of organizing the Chinese Antarctic expeditions since China adopted the Protocol in 1994. 
We have been working on a draft Act of a special law of protecting the Antarctic Environment for a couple of years, and we expect that the Law could be brought to the formal constituting procedure. 
2. Contingency Plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol
Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration has established several regulations and contingency plans for the Expeditions in Antarctica.
Specific environment management regulations and oil spill contingency plans have been implemented strictly by the expeditioners on the M/V XUELONG and at the Great Wall Station and Zhongshan Station. 
3. Circulation of information pursuant to Annex I, Article 6(1) of the Protocol 
3.1 Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures 
All Chinese Antarctic activities  must undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before the programs are carried out in Antarctica. Only those evaluated eligible can be conducted as proposed. The approved programs need to submit post–activity report on request. 
At the present time, the EIAs are conducted directly by the applicants of the program and  submitted to the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration ,which then seeks expert advice on the potential environmental impacts of the proposed activities.
Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration makes the final determination as to whether or not an activity should proceed. In the future ,a  new procedure will be established, which request the applicants to search for experts to work out the EIAs.  The new procedure will produce more reliable and comprehensive EIAs, and can consider the potential accumulative environment impacts in a better way. 
3.2. List of Initial Environmental Evaluations 
 A list of Initial Environmental Evaluations for the 2005/2006 season prepared in accordance with Annex I, Article 2 of the Protocol is included in Appendix .
3.3. Significant information obtained, and any action taken in consequence thereof, from procedures put in place in accordance with Annex I, Articles 2(2) and 5 of the Protocol 
During the 2005/2006 season, no significant information has been obtained from monitoring procedures put in place in accordance with the provisions of Annex I.
3.4. Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (Annex 1, Article 3 (6)) 
No Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations were prepared for the 2005/2006 season.
4.	Report pursuant to Annex II, Article 6 of the Protocol

4.1. Number and nature of permits issued under Annex II of the Protocol during the 2005/2006season
During the 2005/2006 season, no permits have been issued under Annex II of the protocol.
4.2. Records and statistics concerning flora and fauna taken in the 2005/2006season 
10 protozoan samples and 12 zooplankton samples were obtained in the sea near Great Wall Station. 210 microorganism samples and many zooplankton samples were obtained through investigation in the South Ocean.
5. Report pursuant to Annex III, Article 9 of the Protocol
Waste management regulation has been implemented by every expedition wherever they are on board M/A Xuelong, or at the two Chinese Antarctic stations. All the wastes are separated and treated according to the regulation. 
Waste management regulation for the station:
The solid waste materials are divided into 4 catalogues and treated in different ways at the two stations.
    • Combustible materials are not permitted to store in the station for a long time. They are burned in the incinerator after being recorded. The remains are put in case and will be transported back to China.
    • Metal, plastic and other non-combustible materials are collected and piled to be transported back to China;
    • Glass materials are smashed into pieces and put into cases to be transported back to China
    • Batteries useless are collected into cases and will be transported back to China.
The daily domestic liquid waste is treated in the sewage treatment system and then discharged into the sea.  The chemical liquid waste is collected. 
The fuel waste and lubricant are collected separately.
Waste management regulation for the vessel:
All the wastes on the M/V “Xuelong”, including the daily domestic liquid waste and the solid waste, are treated according to the related regulations of the IMO.
6. Report pursuant to Annex IV of the Protocol
6.1 Notice of activities undertaken in case of emergency (Article 7 (2))  
There have been no cases of emergency in the 2005/2006season.
6.2. Implementation of Sovereign Immunity (Art 11(2))
The People’s Republic of China state owned and operated vessels in Antarctic implement Annex IV of the Protocol. 
7. Report pursuant to Annex V, Article 10 of the Protocol
7.1 Number and nature of permits issued under Annex V of the Protocol during the 2005/2006 Season
 None.
7.2 Summary descriptions of activities conducted in any ASMA, ASPA or Historic Site or Monument 
None.

7.3. Measures taken to implement the provisions of Annex V
A joint working Paper Management Plan for the Larsemann Hills Antarctic Specially Managed Area  will be submitted to CEP Ⅹ by Australia, China, Romania and Russia Federation.

Ecological Monitoring at the Great Wall Station
The ecological monitoring at Chinese Great Wall Station provides a focal point for ecosystem studies that will include measurement of both physical and biological parameters.
The program mainly includes: 
    1) Monitoring of environmental parameters of Antarctic coastal area
    2) Studies on biodiversity of Antarctic coastal area
    3) Physical and biochemical adaptation of Antarctic zooplankton key species
