Korea's First Ice Breaker

The Korea’s First Icebreaker is currently under construction. The 7,000-ton Icebreaker is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2009. The vessel is designed for operation in one-meter -thick-multiple-year ice condition (KR PL 10) and it will be equipped with twin Azimuth propulsion units driven by diesel-electric propulsion plant. It will accommodate up to 85 persons, including 25 crew members. 
Following a circumspective feasibility test in 2003, the basic design and general arrangement of vessel had been produced in 2004 and 2005 respectively. At the beginning of this year, the contract for constructing an icebreaker was awarded to Hanjin Heavy Industry, Inc., the fifth largest ship-building company in Korea. 
The vessel will be operated for scientific and logistic purposes in both Antarctic and Arctic waters. We expect that the icebreaker would enhance our capability of conducting scientific research in polar waters with upgraded efficiency and quality. Currently Korea is operating one “over-wintering” station, the King Sejong on King George Island in the Antarctic, and it also has research facilities, the Dasan, in NyAlesund, Svalbard Islands in the Arctic.
