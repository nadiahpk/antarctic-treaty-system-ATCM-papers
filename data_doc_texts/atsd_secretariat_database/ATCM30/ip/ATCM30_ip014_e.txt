Annual Report submitted by France on the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty as required by Article 17 of the Protocol
2007
1) Reporting of measures adopted pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 13 of the Protocol

Article 13 of the Protocol
1.  Each Party shall take appropriate measures within its competence, including the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative actions and enforcement measures, to ensure compliance with this Protocol.
2.  Each Party shall exert appropriate efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no one engages in any activity contrary to this Protocol.
Legislative and regulatory mechanism
Law No 2003-347 of April 15, 2003 regarding the protection of the environment in Antarctica (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 90 dated April 16, 2003, p. 6727) implements the provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection, signed in Madrid on October 4, 1991, to the Antarctic Treaty, adopted in Washington on December 1, 1959, and its five annexes. This law introduces in the Environmental Code the provisions of a legislative nature necessary to enforce the Madrid Protocol. Furthermore the law contains provisions for penal sanctions. Such actions are applicable to all activities subject to authorization, which violate the procedure. A review is underway regarding the treatment of other activities such as those subject to the declaration regime, in an effort to insure consistency throughout the process. 
Decree No 2005-403 of April 28, 2005 (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 101 dated April 30, 2005, p. 7563) completes this legislative provision on several important points, granting the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department (TAAF) primary competence to authorize activities in Antarctica and make the relevant decisions on files of declarations. It also defines the content and modalities of the assessment prior to impact and stipulates the procedure applicable to prior declarations and requests for authorization. In this regard, the Senior Administrator of the TAAF receives all declarations on activities and grants due authorizations, including requests for permits submitted in compliance with the Annexes to the Protocol. 
The entry into force of the legislative and regulatory mechanism contained in Book VII of the Environmental Code marks the end of the implementation of the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection in Antarctica and its five annexes by France.
In compliance with article R.712-3 of the Environmental Code, decree of May 23, 2006 (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 128 dated June 3, 2006, p. 8452) contains a list of activities which must be the object only of a previous declaration as defined under Article L. 712-1(II) and Article R.712-3 of the Environmental Code, provided they only have a less than a minor or transitory impact on the environment.

Law No 2005-501 of May 19, 2005 (Official Gazette of the French Republic No 116 dated May 20, 2005, p. 8732) authorizes the adoption of Annex V to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, on area protection and management, whose enforcement is ensured, in part, by the aforementioned legal provisions. 
The Annex was published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic pursuant to Decree No 2005-1075 dated August 23, 2005 (Official Gazette of the French Republic of September 1, 2005, p.14163). In article R.714-1 of the aforementioned decree of April 28, 2005 all modalities to designate the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas are stipulated  as well as the Antarctic Specially Managed Areas as defined in Annex V,  stipulating that it is incumbent upon the Ministry of Foreign Affaires to adopt the procedure to designate areas of that nature and registration of their management plans in compliance with said Annex at the request of the Ministry for the Environment, after consultation with the Committee for Polar Environment and, if necessary, with the Senior Committee for Sites, Views and Landscape.

Committee for the Polar Environment

The Committee for the Polar Environment, created by Decree No 93-740 of March 29,1993, which in turn was amended by Decree No 2002-496 of April 9, 2002 (Official Gazette of the French Republic dated April 12, 2002), is under the aegis of the Ministry for the Environment. It is responsible for checking the compatibility of relevant human activities by French authorities in polar and sub-Antarctic areas with the preservation of the environment. The Committee receives inquiries on the designation of Specially Protected Antarctic Areas and Specially Managed Areas in keeping with Annex V to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. 

Likewise, the Committee for the Polar Environment receives questions about the program of activities, major projects and impact studies of all human activities in the aforementioned areas. It deals with constant and regular monitoring of human activities in those areas and is responsible for emergency plans and inspection reports. The Committee may also receive inquiries about all matters related to the polar environment and review, on its own initiative, all matters within its sphere of competence. It may also carry out studies and research and formulate proposals and recommendations it considers necessary. 

The by-law dated January 26, 2005 on the creation of the Committee for the Polar Environment was published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic on January 29, 2005. The Committee is composed of a chairperson and ten important figures with a four-year mandate, renewable once, chosen on the basis of their scientific and technological competence on environmental issues. The Committee for the Polar Environment met on three occasions:  October 3, 2005, June 7, 2006 and September 11, 2006 at the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. The items on the agenda included a summary of requests for authorization and declaration for activities granted by the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department (TAAF) as well programs carried out both in the Arctic and the Antarctic. A status review of the proposed natural reserve for Southern lands was carried out along with as assessment of the impact of bioprospection on the Antarctic environment. The next meeting of the PEC shall take place on March 23, 2007.
(2) Number and nature of permits issued (Annex II to the Protocol, article 6.2) during the 2004-2007 term
 Article 6
 Exchange of information (…)
2. Each Party shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee before the end of November of each year of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1above and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 1st July to 30th June.

The by-law of August 4, 1998 establishes measures for the protection of birds present in the environs of Dumont d’Urville base. The destruction or removal of eggs or nests is at all times prohibited, as well as the destruction, mutilation, capture or stuffing of non domestic species and, alive or dead, their transport, hawking or peddling, utilization, offer them for sale, their sale or purchase. These protection measures were adopted in keeping with the views expressed by the Committee for the Polar Environment.

For the 2006-2007 season, five applications for permits for capture/removal of protected species nesting in Adelie Land were submitted to the French Antarctic and Southern Lands Department. They were linked to long term follow-up studies and specific research, involving ringing, bird control, sampling of blood, muscles and body organs as well as euthanasia.

The experiments were authorized by a decision rendered by the National Council for the Protection of Nature (under the Ministry for the Environment).

The species affected were 100 snow petrels, 100 Antarctic skuas, 56 Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), 632 Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), 46 Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli), 100 giant petrels, 20 fulmars, 20 Wilson petrels and 20 Cape petrels.

These permits were granted to IPEV (French Polar Institute Paul-Emile Victor) for the scientific programs they perform. 

Since October 2002, as was originally provided for in the Environmental Code, permits to capture and release species covered in Title I of Volume II of the rural code regarding the protection of nature are issued by the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department. 
3) Waste disposal and waste management pursuant to Annex III to the Protocol
France has reaffirmed the ban to export waste to the Antarctic Treaty Area, introducing in its domestic legislation the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (and its six annexes), adopted on March 22, 1989 and published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic under Decree No 92-883 dated August 27, 1992.

The amendments to the Annex to the 1978 Protocol regarding al International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, of 1973, which designates Antarctica as a special area under the MARPOL Convention, were published in keeping with Decree No 97-610 dated May 31, 1997.
4) Inventory of activities pursuant to Annex III to the Protocol, articles 8(3) (annex III article 9(1))
Article 8
Waste management planning
3. Each Party shall, as far as is practicable, also prepare an inventory of locations of past activities (such as traverses, field depots, field bases, crashed aircraft) before the information is lost, so that such locations can be taken into account in planning future scientific programs (such as snow chemistry, pollutants in lichens, or ice core drilling)..

Article 9
Circulation and Review of Waste Management Plans
1. The waste management plans prepared in accordance with Article 8, reports on their implementation and the inventories referred to in Article 8 (3), shall be included in the annual exchanges of information in accordance with Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and related recommendations under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.

All waste produced in Adelie Land, except grey water y sewage, son removed. The management program established by the Paul Emile Victor Polar Institute consists on reducing the volume of waste to be treated, particularly solid waste to be combusted, and, regarding non-fuel solid waste, training of members of expeditions and the adoption of simple procedures for waste processing. The fuels used at Dumont d’Urville are transported and stored in barrels or in drums, depending on their nature and use. Since February 1992 waste is transported to Australia with a permit issued by the Federal Ministry for the Environment. The waste is collected at the source in accordance with strict standards.

In Dome C, in the Project itself of the French-Italian Concordia station, waste management is considered, particularly wastewater, with procedures that are not confined to the mere compliance with the Madrid Protocol provisions. In this regard, an agreement was reached between the two construction entities (IPEV of France and PNRA, Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide, of Italy) and the European Space Agency to develop a grey water and sewage treatment system with recycling facilities used on board manned space vehicles.
The table below contains a summary of waste volumes and weights brought back from Dumont d’Urville to Australia (types of wastes which may treated or stored in that country under special arrangements) or to France (for the remaining types of wastes) for the 2005-2006 season.

5) Number and nature of permits covered in Annex V corresponding to 2006-2007 

In November and December 2006, the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Department issued seven access permits to protected areas in Adelie Land which are part of ASPA No 120, Pointe-Geologie Archipelago. 
These permits were granted to IPEV for four scientific programs.  
They dealt with
    • Follow-up of reproduction observed visually and without contact, as well as studies of cold survival mechanisms in Emperor and Adelie penguins;
    • Long-term follow-up and remote counting of colonies of Emperor penguins, snow petrels and other protected studies;
    • Study on the tortoise formation of Emperor penguins;
    • Study on local pollinic flora.
