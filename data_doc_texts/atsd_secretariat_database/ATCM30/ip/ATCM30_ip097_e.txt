International Polar Year Research: Project ANDRILL




International Polar Year Research: Project ANDRILL
Information Paper submitted by New Zealand, Germany, Italy and the United States
Executive Summary
During the 2006/07 Antarctic season the ANDRILL science consortium of the United States, Italy, Germany and New Zealand national programmes achieved the deepest ever geological borehole yet drilled on the Antarctic continental margin.  The drill site on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, which forms the northwest corner of the Ross Ice Shelf, drilled through 80 metres of ice shelf and 850 metres of sea to extract a core depth of 1,285 metres.  This was the first ever geological drilling using an ice shelf as a drilling platform and the longest geological rock core achieved in Antarctica.
The record is unique in terms of its quality and core recovery (99%), and that it represents the very first record with direct evidence for Antarctic ice sheet behaviour over the last 10 million years.   The interval between 2-5 million years ago, has good age control, and will provide important new knowledge on how the Ross Ice Shelf and associated ice sheets behaved when  Earth is thought  to have been 2-3°C warmer than today – analogous to temperatures predicted by the IPCC for the next 50-100 years. The climate proxy information from the drillcore will calibrate computer climate models and help a better understanding of the sensitivities of ice sheets and ice shelves to a range of temperatures, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, as well as providing new advances in understanding McMurdo volcanism, tectonic history and paleoecology.
One of key research findings has been the fact that the Antarctic ice sheet advanced and retreated more that 50 times during the last 5 million years. 
1. Introduction
ANDRILL (ANtarctic Geological DRILLing) is a multi-national collaboration comprised of scientists, educators, students, technicians, drillers and support staff from Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States.  ANDRILL’s goal is to uncover the geological history of Antarctica by drilling and recovering sediment core samples from below the seafloor beneath the Antarctic ice shelf and sea-ice, to understand the Antarctic continent’s past and probable future. The scientists involved recognise that critical questions regarding the history and behaviour of past Antarctic ice cover can be addressed by drilling a series of sites on the continental margin to reveal the ice sheet’s response to past periods of global warming and cooling.
2. ANDRILL Consortium
ANDRILL is comprised of a consortium of four national programmes under the leadership of the ANDRILL Operations Management Group (AOMG).
    • National Science Foundation (NSF), USA
    • Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Germany
    • National Antarctic Program (PNRA) for Italy
    • Antarctica New Zealand
Science leadership is provided by an international scientific consortium, McMurdo Sound ANDRILL Science Implementation Committee (MASIC). Each nation has two representatives on the MASIC, and also includes the two co-chief scientists for each of the drill sites, Tim Naish and Ross Powell (2006-2007), Fabio Florindo and David Harwood (2007-2008).  The committee is presently chaired by Dr Gary Wilson. The ANDRILL Science Committee (ASC) is separately tasked with the development and planning for future Antarctic science proposals, and is chaired by Dr Tim Naish. The ASC comprises a national representative and proponents of future drilling projects.
ANDRILL Project Management has been carried out through Antarctica New Zealand, who employs the ANDRILL Project (operations) Manager, Jim Cowie. The science and outreach programme is coordinated through the ANDRILL Science Management Office (SMO) at the University of Nebraska, USA, who employs the Executive Science Manager, Dr Frank Rack, and the Staff Scientist, Dr Richard Levy.. 
The current project budget is $30 million USD (2/3 for research, education and outreach, 1/3 for operations).  Over 100 scientists, technicians and students are involved from the partner national programmes.  New Zealand has overseen a 28 person drilling team as part of the consortium.

3. Science Objectives
Antarctica plays a pivotal role in our global system, but much needed data are lacking due to limited exposure of rock exposures due to the existence of an ice sheet for the last 33 million years. Although the deepest ice cores now provide climate archives over the last 1 million years, high-quality climate archives before this time can only accessed by drilling the marine sedimentary basins adjacent to the ice sheets. Because these ice-proximal marine sediments are usually covered by seasonal sea-ice or permanent ice shelves a drilling system has been developed that can be positioned in floating ice platforms. This system utilises proven Cape Robert’s Project technology, but has been modified to operate through deep ice access holes on ice shelves, kept open by a hot-water reaming system. The older sedimentary climate archives are critical because they provide a picture of Earth’s climate and Antarctic ice sheet behaviour when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were higher, up to two times present levels, driving higher global temperatures – a picture that ice core records cannot give us. Without reference records provided by geological drilling projects, such as ANDRILL, our understanding of the global system would remain incomplete and focussed towards largely non-Antarctic records.
Key science objectives are:

    i. Thresholds and stages in the development of the cryosphere.
    • Development of West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the Ross Ice Shelf
    • Shift of a dynamic ice sheet into the current deep-freeze (~15 to 3 million years ago)

    ii. Climatic optima and ice sheet variability
    • Inter-hemispheric linkages between north and south polar regions
    • Testing the proxy records of Quaternary climate variation
    • Past periods of extreme warmth - - Pliocene, marine oxygen isotope stage 31

    iii. Ice sheet modulation of global climate and sea-level
    • Influence of ice shelves and sea-ice on the global ocean system
    • Effect of changes in the Ross Ice Shelf on Antarctic Bottom Water production
    • High-resolution records of Neogene Milankovitch cyclicity in ice sheet and global sea-level

    iv. Origins and adaptations of polar biota
    • Mode and timing of the evolution of the polar and sea-ice biota
    • Biotic response to warm, cold and extreme environments and events

    v. West Antarctic Rift and uplift of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains (TAM)
Mechanism, timing and flexural response to volcanic loading
    • Influence of glacial, tectonic, and volcanic processes in sediment accumulation
    • Relationship of TAM uplift and climate model boundary conditions
4. Drill Sites
There are two drill sites:

        i. McMurdo Ice Shelf Project (MIS)
Drilled in 2006 through the McMurdo Ice Shelf aiming for a sedimentary record of 10 million years ago to the present day.

        ii. Southern McMurdo Sound Project (SMS)
Scheduled to be drilled through McMurdo Sound sea ice in 2007 aiming for a sedimentary record of 17 to 5 million years ago.
5. Drilling Technology
The ANDRILL drilling system is based around a minerals drilling rig constructed by UDR Australia, customised for Antarctic conditions and science requirements.  It incorporates a 13 metre drilling sledge that jacks up three metres to allow space for daily tidal movements, a drill fluids system, a cementing system and a hot water drill system required cut through the McMurdo Ice Shelf and thick multi-year sea-ice in Southern McMurdo Sound.  It is capable of a drilling depth of 2,000 metres (inclusive of the water column) and cost approximately $3 million USD.
6. Environmental Impact Assessment
A comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE) was presented at ATCM XXVI (Madrid) in 2003 covering seismic site survey, ice shelf drilling and support camp requirements.  The project was further subjected to environmental audit during the 2006 drilling season.
7. Education and Outreach
Each national programme has separate educational outreach programmes coordinated through the Science Management Office:

    • PROJECT ICEBERG
    • ANDRILL’s education and outreach portal

8. 2006/07 Season Highlights
    • First geological drilling from an Antarctic ice shelf as a drilling platform
    • First combining technology of ice hot-water drilling and geological drilling
    • Deepest geological borehole in Antarctica (1,284 metres) (previous record was 998 metres)
    • Longest geological rock core in Antarctica
    • 6,000 metres of total pipe used
    • Drilling involved 84 metres of ice shelf, 850 metres of sea water and 1,280 metres of geological core
9. 2006/07 Initial Science Results
    • Add to understanding of response of ice sheet and ice shelf to changes in atmospheric and ocean temperature.
    • Critical new data for climate and ice sheet model validation, especially for warmer climate scenarios.
    • Best record of the last 10 million years d in Antarctica.
    • New diatom biostratigraphy and paleoecology.
    • Major new information about McMurdo Volcanics and their history, and submarine volcanism.
    • Significant advances in understanding tectonic history and style of region.

10. 2007/08 Season Objectives
During the austral summer of 2007, ANDRILL will drill from a sea ice platform in Southern McMurdo Sound (SMS) to obtain new information about the Antarctic Cryosphere and evolution of the Antarctic rift basins.  The key aim is to establish a robust history of the Neogene Antarctic ice sheet variation and climate evolution that can be integrated into continental and global records toward a better understanding of Antarctica’s role in the past, present and future global system. The SMS drill record will overlap and extend the MIS record providing a picture of the transition from dynamic to more permanent ice sheets on Antarctica
The project is seen as just as logistically challenging as the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) site with challenges of a shorter drilling season due to the nature of drilling on an annual sea ice platform rather than a permanent ice shelf platform.
