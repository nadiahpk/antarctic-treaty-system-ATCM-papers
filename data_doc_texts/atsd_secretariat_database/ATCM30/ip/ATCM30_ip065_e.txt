Concept and structure of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation “On regulating activities of the Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic”

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty with five Annexes was approved in the Russian Federation by adopting the Federal Law of 24 May 1997 No. 79 “On ratification of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty”. For implementing the Protocol the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation of 18 December 1997 “On provision of fulfilling the clauses of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty” stipulates that the Russian legal entities and individual persons undertake activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area only on the basis of duly executed permits confirming compliance of this activity with the requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The aforementioned permits are issued by the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring in the order adopted by the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation of 11 December 1998 No 1476 “On adopting the Procedure for Consideration and Issuance of Permits for Activities of Russian Individual Persons and Legal Entities in the Antarctic Treaty Area”. As of 1 April 2007, 43 permits were issued for different types of activities of the Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic Treaty Area, including:
    • activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition
    • marine geophysical studies
    • climbing the Antarctic mountain peaks
    • research flights of heavy transport aviation
    • sea tourism onboard the Russian marine ships
    • icebreaking escort of transport ships
    • cruising navigation onboard yacht
    • construction of new facilities at the Russian Antarctic stations.
The undertaken measures allowed regulating most types of activity of the Russian organizations and citizens in the Antarctic Treaty Area from the point of view of its possible environmental impact.
In recent years, the international Antarctic community repeatedly expressed its concern of the changed character and intensification of different types of activity, especially non-governmental, in the region. It was determined that with the beginning of the 21st century there was significant diversification of the types of Antarctic activity, and the number of people visiting annually the Antarctic with different purposes cardinally increased. In particular, one notes the development of Antarctic tourism, harvesting of marine living resources, and there is an increase of scientific studies in the region, the results of which are widely used for commercial purposes (biological surveying). Intensification of Antarctic activity significantly increases the risks of adverse environmental impact at the sixth continent.
For addressing these issues, the Antarctic community at XXVII and XXVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) adopted Measure 4 (2004) “Insurance and contingency planning for tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area” and Measure 1 (2005) “Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies” (Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty). This required practically from all Contracting Parties to adopt special national legal bills for increasing efficiency of the mechanisms of state control of their individual persons and legal entities in the Antarctic. Obligatory insurance of Russian individual persons and legal entities in compliance with the legislation in force in the Russian Federation can be applied exclusively on the basis of a special Federal Law regulating this type of insurance. In addition the existing in Russia regulations of the Civil, Administration and Criminal Codes are not applicable outside the territory of the Russian Federation, which makes it incompetent to apply liability measures for violations in case of emergency environmental situations in the Antarctic. A natural follow-up of this problem is a need for a clear legal differentiation of the governmental and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic. These factors determined the need for developing a special legislative bill, which required along with the issues raised in Measure 4 (2004) and Measure 1 (2005) at XXVII and XXVIII ATCM covering some social and customs problems of implementing the activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition in the Antarctic, which are now beyond the “legal field” framework. With this purpose after considering the final documents of the aforementioned ATCM, the Government of the Russian Federation entrusted on 30 December 2005 the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring jointly with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Natural Resources and Ministry of Agriculture with participation of the Russian Academy of Science to develop in 2006 a Concept of the Federal Law “On regulation of activities of Russian citizens and Legal Entities in the Antarctic” (Concept) and the Technical Task for its creation.
The Concept was developed in compliance with the requirements of the procedures and regulations about the lawmaking activity adopted in the Russian Federation.
The structure of the Concept has the following sections:
    1) Main idea, aims and subject of legal regulation, circle of people covered by the action of this bill
    2) Place of the future law in the system of the legislation in force in the Russian Federation
    3) General characteristics and assessment of legal regulations, relevant public relations and activities of the Russian individual persons and legal entities in the Antarctic
    4) Analysis of the Antarctic legislature of other countries
    5) Social-economical, political, legal and other consequences of implementing the future Law
The proposed Concept was approved by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of Agriculture the Russian Academy of Science and underwent the required legal expert examination according to the procedure adopted in the Russian Federation. In December 2006, this Concept and the Technical Task for the development of the Federal Law were approved by the Commission on lawmaking activity of the Government of the Russian Federation and were included to the lawmaking plan of the Government for 2007.
The structure of the Federal Law has the following sections:
    1) Preamble
    2) General provisions
    3) State regulation of activity in the Antarctic
    4) Safety of activity in the Antarctic
    5) International cooperation in implementing activities in the Antarctic
    6) Liability in implementing activities in the Antarctic
    7) Concluding provisions
The Draft Federal Law was commissioned by the Government of the Russian Federation. The Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring jointly with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and the Russian Academy of Science were charged with the development of the draft.
The draft text of the Federal Law “On regulation of activities of the Russian citizens and Legal Entities in the Antarctic” is being prepared in the framework of Project 1 “Develop the normative-legal documents regulating presence of citizens of Russia in the Antarctic, Study and Research of the Antarctic” of the Federal Program “World Ocean” in 2007. After approval and expert legal conclusion the Draft Federal Law with the other necessary explanatory materials will be considered in the Government of the Russian Federation and submitted for consideration to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.
