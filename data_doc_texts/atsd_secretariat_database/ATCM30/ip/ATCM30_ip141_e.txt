on the external audit of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat

1. Regulation 11 of the Financial Regulations of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat attached to Decision 4 (2003) states as follows:

“The ATCM shall appoint an external auditor who shall be the Auditor-General, or equivalent statutory authority from a Consultative Party of the ATCM, and shall serve for a term of two years with the possibility of re-appointment. The ATCM will ensure the external auditor’s independence from the Secretariat and the Secretariat’s staff.  The ATCM shall establish the terms of office, allocate appropriate funds to the external auditor and may consult him/her on the introduction or amendment of any financial regulations or detailed accounting methods, as well as on all matters affecting auditing procedures and methodology.”

2. By virtue of Decision 5 (2005), adopted at the XXVIII ATCM, the Consultative Parties appointed the Sindicatura General de la Nación (SIGEN) to perform such external audit. SIGEN is the agency responsible for the internal controls of the National Executive Power. This agency has submitted a new proposal to conduct an external audit of the ATS for the financial years ending on March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009.

3.  SIGEN’s responsibilities are: 

    • to develop and implement internal oversight regulations;
