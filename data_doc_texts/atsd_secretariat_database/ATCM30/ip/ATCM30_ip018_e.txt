International Workshop of Antarctic Competent Authorities





International Workshop of Antarctic Competent Authorities
Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Berlin, Germany

Information Paper submitted by 
Belgium, France, Germany, NL, Peru, Russia, UK and Ukraine

1. Introduction
The Forum of Competent Authorities was started in 2005 as a common initiative of the Netherlands and Germany. A specific website of the Discussion Forum of Competent Authorities (DFCA) has been established through the online CEP Discussion Forum: http://forum.cep.aq. Some Consultative Parties used the DFCA website to upload their questions and to open the discussion. There are no changes due to the transfer of the discus­sion forum website from Australia to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.
Already announced at CEP IX, in Edinburgh, UK, in June 2006, the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) organized an international workshop of Antarctic com­petent authorities. The workshop was hosted by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.
2. Aims of the Workshop
The idea for this workshop was presented in the information paper (IP 043/ATCM) Ger­many and the Netherlands submitted on the occasion of the ATCM meeting in 2006. 
Germany wanted to discuss the fol­lowing topics: 
    • National procedures for assessing and / or authorizing activities in Antarctica,
    • Implementation of ATCM measures, resolutions and decisions, e.g. site-specific guide­lines, etc., at the national level,
    • Co-ordination of the assessment and / or authorizing process with respect to multilat­eral activities, e.g. in case of Article 8 (4) of the Environmental Protocol, etc,
    • Assessment of hydroacoustic and seismic activities / categorization according to the provi­sions of the Environmental Protocol.

A discussion of the above topics was supposed to:
    a) enable persons working for the Antarctic competent authority of Contracting Parties to exchange information on legal systems for the implementation of the Protocol at national level;
    b) identify issues of common interest and/or concern between Antarctic competent authorities and to start informal discussions on such issues;
    c) discuss the way(s) in which informal contacts and discussions between Antarctic competent authorities may be continued in the future.
The Environmental Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty (EP) requires the establishment of pro­cedures to guarantee compliance with international obligations, and of activities accord­ing to Articles 6 and 7 and Annex I of the Protocol in particular. Many countries have entrusted com­petent authorities with this task and have established specific national legisla­tion.

Experience from different national systems as well as the issues discussed within the framework of the ATCMs and the CEPs showed that a common approach taken by the com­petent authorities in many cases is still missing but would be extremely helpful to achieve the goal of international comparable standards. 
For detailed programme of the workshop see Annex 1. 
For the list of participants see Annex 2.
3. General Outcome of the Workshop
Twenty-three experts from 8 Antarctic Treaty Parties as well as ASOC participated in the workshop. It was a very constructive meeting and the discussions emphasised clearly the usefulness of the informal exchange of views and experiences in respect of various issues regarding the implementation of the Protocol. All participants gave presentations about the implementation of the Environmental Proto­col of the Antarctic Treaty into national legislation highlighting achievements and problems. These presentations were uploaded to the DFCA Website. 
In preparation of the Workshop all Consultative Parties were asked to fill in a questionnaire worked out by Germany in order to get an overview of the implementation of the Environmental Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty (EP) into national legislation. Altogether, 17 Antarctic Treaty Parties answered to the questions. The answers could be summarised as follows:
    • The Environmental Protocol including Annexes III and IV are implemented on national level via direct use of the protocol, special act or integration into existing legislation.
    • In most cases, research institute and competent authority for issuing permits are different institutions. 
    • Subject of the permit is either the whole expedition or a single activity, depending on the type of activity (research program, tourism and/or logistics).
    • Permits are issued to organizers (responsible for all participants of the activity) as well as to individuals.
    • Most countries accept permits by other Antarctic Treaty Parties. 
    • Regarding EIA, most countries (except 2) make no distinction between scientific and non-scientific activi­ties. 
    • Only one country requires administrative charges for the permit of non-scientific activities.
    • Most Parties require Post Visit Reports.

The detailed answers to the questionnaire can be downloaded from the website of the Discussion Forum of Competent Authorities (DFCA) at http://forum.cep.aq/.
Another important outcome was that with respect to multilateral activities there is a need for co-ordination between competent authorities. Competent authorities present at the workshop agreed to inform each other about multilateral projects (research, tourism, individuals) so that joint actions can be taken. The workshop also discovered that resolution 3 (2004) "Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities: Enhanced Co-operation Amongst Parties" is not always followed. 
Regarding seismic activities, the results of the International Workshop “Impacts of seismic survey activities on whales and other marine biota” which took place at the Federal Envi­ronment Agency in Dessau, Germany on 5-7 September 2006 and the planned risk analysis need further discussion at international level. 
The discussion on cumulative effects should go ahead with a more strategic approach taking into account all activities and not only tour­ism. It was questioned how site specific guidelines could be combined with the ASMA/ASPA approach. More over, an information exchange on the implementation of Measure 4 (2004) “Insurance and Contingency Planning for Tourism and Non-Governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area” is absolutely necessary.
All participants were of the opinion that it would be very helpful to have permits issued by different Antarctic Competent authorities translated into English. In con­clusion, all participating countries stressed that Antarctic Competent authorities should have some room for further discussion on CEP/ATCM meetings. There is also a need for co-ordi­nation within the authorisation process, e.g. concerning:
    • Multilateral activities,
    • Cumulative effects,
    • National implementation of site-specific guidelines.

The legal terms “less than a minor or transitory impact”, “a minor or a transitory impact” and “more than a minor or transitory impact” are not clearly defined in the Protocol or the ATCM Guidelines on EIA. The presentations showed that countries assess possible environmental impacts differently. In order to find out the differences in the EIA process, a draft matrix for possibly categorising activities according to their possible envi­ronmental impacts was presented. It was considered to be a provisional tool taking into account that every activity has to be dealt with as case-by-case study. This preliminary matrix was controversially discussed and judged to be an unsuitable tool. That’s why comments on how this issue could be advanced are highly appreciated.
Finally, France raised the question on the responsibility /liability of the competent authorities in case of physical injuries caused by an accident or a disaster in Antarctica during the activity.
4.  Forecast
    1. The DFCA is a good informal forum for information exchange between competent authorities and should go on. It offers the opportunity to learn from each other and to gain experiences of multilateral projects (research, tourism, individual activities).
    2. Germany and the Netherlands will promote the work of the DFCA for the next CEP meeting trying to encourage interested parties to use the forum more intensively.
    3. Competent authorities are requested to use the DFCA to inform each other about multilateral pro­jects (research, tourism, individual activities).
    4. The workshop participants and current members of the DFCA kindly invite other competent authorities to become a member of the DFCA and participate in the informal discussions and information exchange. 
    5. It is planned to have the DFCA opened to all interested experts, however, there should be a password protected forum for competent authorities only.
    6. Special meetings of competent authorities in connection with CEP/ATCM meetings would be very helpful to enable discussions on common issues and concerns regarding the implementation of the Protocol and ATCM recommendations.
5. Operational Activities
According to the outcome of the workshop a list of issues for which a common practice already exists as well as a list of questions that need further discussion should be pre­pared. In connection with the DFCA, those lists should be the basis for the future work. 
That’s why we would highly appreciate all Antarctic Treaty Parties actively partici­pating in our discussions. In order to enable as many Contracting Parties as possible to contribute to this information exchange we propose e.g. half/one-day meetings in the margins of or prior or subsequent to a CEP/ATCM meeting. Therefore, it should be checked whether such a meet­ing could already take place in connection with the next CEP/ATCM meeting in 2008.
