IPY2007-2008 Launch in Japan

 The International Symposium “Asian Collaboration in IPY 2007-2008” was held at the Science Council of Japan in Tokyo on the 1st of March, 2007, the beginning of the International Polar Year (IPY) of 2007-2008. The symposium was organized jointly by the IPY National Committee of Japan under the Science Council of Japan (SCJ), and the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR).
IPY 2007-2008 covers two full annual cycles from March 2007 to March 2009, and involves thousands of scientists from over 60 nations. A total of 147 Japanese scientists will participate in various programs of IPY 2007-2008, along with a much greater number of Asian scientists. The Japanese contribution to IPY2007-2008 is summarized below. 
A total of 84 projects from more than 400 full proposals submitted to the IPY Joint Committee by March 2006 include Japanese scientists. Although many projects are interdisciplinary, projects with Japanese participation can be broken down into the following diciplines:
Upper Atmosphere Science (2 projects); Atmosphere Science (16); Glaciology (16); Permafrost studies (4 ); Biology (10); Geoscience (8); Oceanography (9); Marine Biology (7); Databasing (4); Outreach activities (8).



This symposium was planned for the first day of IPY 2007-2008, to exchange information among the participants on scientific activities. Through discussions at the symposium, cooperation among the projects was sought in terms of execution, analysis and data management. Research during IPY 2007-2008 will be thus coordinated for the most efficient production of high-level results.
A total of 117 participants from 16 countries attended the venue at 2345UT on February 28th, 2007 (Figure 1). Fifteen minutes after the opening of the Symposium, the beginning of IPY 2007-2008 was celebrated. The IPY national plans of each Asian country was presented in the first session by India, Japan, Korea and Malaysia (despite intentions to make a presentation, the Chinese representative was regrettably unable to attend the meeting). In the following two sessions, individual IPY research plans were presented by 14 speakers from countries including Australia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Poland and the USA, with an emphasis on points of international collaboration.
As well, 48 presentations were given in the poster session on IPY research plans. There were a number of interesting presentations in social science by Russian researchers, who regrettably could not attend the symposium. Arctic social science is a new field for Japanese polar research. 
The IPY National Committee of Japan considers IPY to be a great opportunity for involving scientists of countries where national polar science programs have not yet been established. It is our pleasure to report that scientists from 8 new countries expressed their interest in the Symposium, even from those that were unable to participate, including Israel, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Philippines and Tajikistan. 
Short papers summarizing the presentations were printed in the form of a booklet (Figure 2) and distributed to the participants at the venue. A copy of the Proceedings is available from the Symposium secretary (ipy2007@nipr.ac.jp). The proceedings can be also downloaded from the Symposium WEB (http://polaris.nipr.ac.jp/~ipy/sympo/). 
By the time the Symposium was concluded in the late afternoon, the participants were convinced, in accordance with the Edinburgh Declaration of the ATCM (Annex I, ATCM XXIX), that international cooperation is indeed essential for the polar research during and beyond IPY2007-2008.
