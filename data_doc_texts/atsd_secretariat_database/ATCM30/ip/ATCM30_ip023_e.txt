Report by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) on “Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters”
Introduction
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) takes this opportunity to thank once again the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) for having invited our Organization to report to the XXXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), on the progress made in the Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters. This report covers the period between the XXIXth and XXXth ATCMs.   
The IHO in conjunction with several other international organizations has been working hard to raise awareness on the importance of improving the priority assigned to conduct hydrographic surveys in Antarctica. We do believe that by doing so we strongly contribute to safety of life at sea, safety of navigation, the protection of the marine environment and the progress on marine scientific research in Antarctica. The status of the progress so far reached is the direct reflect of the activities of the Hydrographic Offices with responsibilities in the Antarctica. The IHO Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica provides the opportunity for coordination and cooperation among participating actors, aiming teamwork to favour effectiveness and best practice in the use of the limited resources allocated by national and international authorities.
The IHO Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica
The 6th Meeting of the IHO Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica (HCA) took place at the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), Punta Arenas, Chile, 06-08 November 2006, jointly organized by the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy (SHOA) and INACH.  Unfortunately, due to previous commitments, the Executive Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat could not make it this time.  
The Chairman, Capt GORZIGLIA (IHB Director) opened the meeting welcoming the 11 HCA Member States present (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, India, Italy, Norway, South Africa and United Kingdom) and 3 representatives of international organizations (COMNAP, SCALOP and IAATO) that participated actively in the event. It has to be highlighted that since the last ATCM, Brazil and Ecuador have signed the Statutes of the HCA and therefore has become full members of the Committee. 
The Committee discussed about membership; reviewed the status of the action list agreed at the last meeting; the progress made by the HCA Hydrographic Survey Work Program Working Group; reviewed the 5 year report to be submitted to the XVIIth International hydrographic Conference (May 2007) and the main activities to be considered by the IHO 5 Years Work program 2008/2012 for the HCA.  
1.  HCA Membership
The Committee after reviewing the situation as regard to membership tasked once again its Chairman to contact the countries that have not yet signed the HCA Statutes, to do so. The Chairman took action and invited the IHO representatives of Japan, Rep. of Korea, Peru, Poland, Ukraine, USA and Uruguay, to consider signing the statutes and participating in HCA activities. Replies are awaited. (See Annex A for details).
2. Status of Actions Agreed.
The Committee reviewed the status of the actions agreed at the last meeting and confirmed that almost all actions had been completed.  
a) Hydrographic surveys conducted
After examining the National reports submitted to the HCA, the Committee expressed its concern for the extremely low hydrographic survey activity conducted by HCA member countries.  Seven out of the fourteen reports indicated that no activity at all has been executed in the last year. This situation is in no way in line with the existing and increasing requirements of hydrographic products. 
Note: Examples of notes included in Reports:
    • Due to presently lack of resources we are not carrying out any surveying and charting activity in Antarctica.
    • The production of the INT charts of our responsibility has been repeatedly delayed because of lack of funding.
    • Similar to the 2004/2005 summer period, no further survey work was conducted during the 2005/2006 summer season due to research cruise non-availability.
The Committee has been discussing SOLAS V Regulation 9 requiring contracting governments to arrange for the provision of hydrographic services and its applicability in the Antarctic Treaty area. In brief, the Committee would like to know the ATS position as regard to who assumes the obligation/responsibility for the provision of hydrographic services in Antarctica. The Committee is also requesting IMO’s views in this regard.   
b) INT Chart Production
The INT Chart production continues to show progress. Out of 99 INT charts contained in the cartographic scheme for the Region M, 53 have already been published. The production of ENC also has shown an increase, and 5 ENC Charts are available. The completion of the INT chart scheme for Region ‘M’ remains the high priority objective for HCA. An ENC scheme for Region ‘M’, is under preparation at the IHB.  (See Annex B for present production status). 
c) IHO Publication S-55 
The HCA has been working closely with the IHB to develop a prototype GIS data base of the S-55, -Worldwide Status of Hydrographic Surveys and Nautical Charting - having a chart background base with different layers, such as INT charts scheme, ENCs scheme and RNCs (as applicable). This database is in progress and will be made available as soon as finalized, as it would be useful to all Regional Hydrographic Commissions. In the case of Antarctica a layer on hydrographic surveys, based on the present data as in S-59 Part II is considered as a provisional measure, to be refined when all States with survey and charting programmes in the region provide updated information. 
For the time being, Antarctica is a gap in the IHO S-55 database. HCA Members, which have not submitted data to be considered in S-55, have been requested to do so in order to advance in its preparation. 
d) Relation with other International Organizations.
The HCA has continued a very fruitful relationship with several international organizations such as IMO, IOC, IAATO, COMNAP, and the proper ATS. Joint efforts have been made mainly with COMNAP and IAATO aiming to raise awareness on the importance to improve the priority for hydrographic surveys in Antarctica. 

  
3. Progress made by the Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group
One of the most relevant discussions took place following the report of the Chairman of the HCA Hydrographic Survey Work Program Working Group, successfully chaired by Mr. Andy Willett (UK). As a result of an interesting exchange of views, several actions were identified, all aiming at improving the safety of navigation as quickly as possible. Some of these actions nowadays in progress are: 
    a) To establish a hydrographic survey program based on national programs, improving the exchange of data and avoiding as much as possible, duplication of surveys. 
    b) To identify producer nations for new INT Charts included in the Region M scheme. 
    c) To seek the status/progress of INT Charts in the region for which there is no information from Producer Nations on their production. 
4. Report to the XVII IHC 
The HCA reviewed and endorsed the HCA Report (2002/2007) to the XVIIth IHC prepared by the Chairman and Vice Chairman (Captain Nairn AUSTRALIA).  
In brief, the report concludes that during the five years period the Committee has: 
    a) Successfully coordinated its activities among HCA Member and with related international organizations. 
    b) Kept up dated the INT Chart scheme for region M based on new requirements and monitored chart production. 
    c) Confirmed that INT Chart implementation depends on the hydrographic survey effort made and therefore the “short list of high priority surveys” defined provides a thoughtful guide to improve effectiveness. 
The report offers a set of proposal that can be summarized as follow:
    d) To invite IHO Member State to increase their hydrographic activity in Antarctica taking advantage of the IPY, aiming to complete the present INT Chart scheme as soon as possible
    e) To request HCA to continue improving the relationship with relevant international organizations, aiming to develop joint projects of common interest, especially ATS, IMO, IOC, COMNAP, SCAR and IAATO.    
    f) To thank IAATO for making available its ships to be used as “ships of opportunity” for hydrographic surveyors as well as for volunteering to collect hydrographic data.

5. HCA 2008/2012 WP
The IHO 5 years Work Program that shall be discussed and finally approved at the IHC in May 2007, includes several actions proposed by the HCA to be executed in the period 2008/2012. The initiatives include: 
    a) Annual meeting of the HCA : to assess hydrographic surveys and INT Charts and ENC production progress; to keep INT Chart and ENC’s scheme updated and to define actions to foster surveys and chart production in coordination with relevant international organizations.  (Yearly)
    b) Relationship with International Organizations: The HCA to deliver special presentations in the form of Seminar aiming to raise awareness on the importance of hydrographic activity in the Antarctica, seeking to encourage cooperation in data collection and sharing in order to improve the quality of hydrographic data available for operational users and ameliorate risks to navigation. It is anticipated the organization of these at normal ATCM, COMNAP and IAATO meetings, in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, to be coordinated. 
    c) HCA Public Relations and Information Management:  The HCA will develop its corresponding component of the IHO web site, aiming for the on-going provision of relevant and updated hydrographic, cartographic and MSI information useful for planning and operation in Antarctic waters, contributing to safety of navigation and protection of marine environment and other applications.  (2011 or before)
    d) HCA Capacity Building: The HCA will organize a two days Workshop on Hydrographic Surveys in Antarctic Techniques and Experiences, aiming to concentrate the IHO´s and others´ experience in running hydrographic surveys in Antarctic and identify best practice to improve this activity.  This activity will be organized in conjunction with the 2011 HCA Meeting, to facilitate coordination, assistance and best use of resources.  

6. Next HCA Meeting
Following the kind invitation from the Servicio de Hidrografia Naval de la Armada Argentina, the Committee decided to accept the invitation and agreed to have the 7th  HCA meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 03-05 October 2007. We take this opportunity to invite the Executive Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat to attend the HCA Meeting. 
Conclusions
    1. The coordination and cooperation between the IHO HCA Members and other international organizations interested in the Antarctica are in its best moment. The ATS should take advantage of this situation and urge its Members to assign a much higher priority to hydrographic survey activities. If this is not improved, then the structure in place and all joint efforts are useless.  
    2. The availability of INT Charts is increasing slowly due to the lack of new hydrographic data and low priority given to Antarctic hydrographic and cartographic activities at a national level. The ATS high concern on the protection of the Antarctic ecosystem does not match with the low priority given to hydro-cartographic activities aiming to improve safety to navigation and protection of the marine environment. 
    3. The ATS might wish to consider the IHO proposal to have the HCA organizing jointly with the ATS Secretariat a set of special presentations in the form of Seminar, during the XXXI ATCM, aiming to raise awareness on the importance of hydrographic activity in the Antarctica. 
Recommendations
It is recommended that the XXXth ATCM: 
    1. To take note of the IHO Report. 
    2. To take action as regard to the conclusions in the report.
