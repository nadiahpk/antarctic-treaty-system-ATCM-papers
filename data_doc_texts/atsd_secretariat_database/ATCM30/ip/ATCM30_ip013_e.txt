Antarctic environment protection under French law



Antarctic environment protection 
under French law

Summary:

France is aware of the responsibility of each state party to the Madrid Protocol to take all measures required to ensure compliance with its provision, and therefore of the importance for each state to know the legislative and regulatory measures implemented by other state parties to the Madrid Protocol to use them as a source and reinforce, as needed, its own legal mechanism. 
Thus France has decided to summarize its regulations for the protection of the environment in Antarctica and the implementation thereof by relevant institutions. This document highlights a number of elements of interest, in the context of the relative freedom of its implementation granted by the Madrid Protocol to its state parties. 
Over the last several years, France has drastically reinforced its legislative and regulatory provisions for the protection of the Antarctic environment. 
Following its approval its 19921, France published the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid, 1991), in the Journal Officiel de la République française (J.O.R.F.)2 in 1998. In order to regulate human activities in the Antarctic while ensuring respect of the environment, France has introduced the relevant provisions of the Madrid Protocol in its Environmental Code. Thus book VII dedicated to environmental protection in the Antarctic was included under the law dated April 15, 20033, completed by a decree dated April 28, 20054 and a ministerial order dated May 23, 20065. 
Since it is the responsibility of each state party to the Madrid Protocol to take “all appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, administrative actions and enforcement measures required to ensure compliance” with the Protocol (Madrid Protocol Art. 13, para. 1), France realizes how important it is for each state to be aware of all legislative and regulatory measures implemented by other state Parties to the Madrid Protocol to use as an inspiration or to strengthen or complete, as needed,  its own legal mechanism. France is also aware of the importance of such data in the framework of an attempt at consistent implementation of the Madrid Protocol by state parties. 
Therefore, France decided to summarize its own regulatory framework on environmental protection in Antarctica as a complement to Information document IP 10 submitted by France at the XXVIII Consultative Meeting (held in Stockholm in 2005) and dealing with “The implementation of the Madrid Protocol on the protection of the Antarctic environment”. Our goal here is not to carry out a legal study of French laws and supplementary texts, since several points are taken directly from the Madrid Protocol, but rather to highlight elements of interest when the Madrid Protocol allows for some adjustments to its implementation by the member states. 
I-French regulatory scope
Although France has opted for the broadest possible approach to environmental protection in Antarctica, it is important to define the exact scope of French regulatory provisions which apply only to specific activities and people.
Relevant activities
French legislative and regulatory measures apply to scientific research, logistics and nongovernmental activities. Article L.711-2 of the Environmental Code looks generically at the “organization and execution of activities in Antarctica”.
Yet, there are some activities that fall outside the purview of French regulations, such as:
    • Fishing activities regulated under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources (Canberra, 1980); 
    • Freedom to navigate and fly over the high seas; 
    • Activities authorized by another state party to the Madrid Protocol;
    • Activities carried out by French government ships or airplanes under police assignments, including fishing, and missions of general interest. 
Stakeholders
In compliance with article L.711-3 of the Environmental Code, French regulation applies to:
    • Any person (regardless of citizenship) considering any activity in Adélie Land as well as any ship or airplane used in such context;
    • Any French citizen (whether a legal entity or a natural person) considering an activity in Antarctica, as well as ships flying under French flag and airplanes registered in France; 
    • Anyone organizing or participating in activities in Antarctica from a French national territory.
Regardless of the person’s identity or the nature of the activity, prior declaration or authorization is required.
II- Mandatory declaration or authorization prior to carrying out any activity in Antarctica
Outside strictly forbidden activities, any planned activity in Antarctica, whether scientific research or of a logistical or tourist nature, requires either a declaration or an authorization. Applicable rules are contingent upon the activity’s impact on the environment. Any activity with less than a minor or transitory impact requires a declaration while any activity causing more than a minor or transitory impact requires formal authorization. 
While the Madrid Protocol fails to define the expression “less than a minor or transitory impact”, France decided to specify which activities require a declaration. A Ministerial Order dated May 23rd, 2006 which spells out the list of activities under Article L.712-3 of the Environmental Code provides an exhaustive list of activities requiring declaration (See Annex I: Activities requiring declaration). This list only includes scientific research or related logistical activities. Thus all activities not appearing on the list, including tourism-related activities, automatically fall under the authorization regime. This list may be amended in view of the experience of activities carried out or projected during the first years of implementation of the regulatory scheme.
1. Procedure
French regulation requires a mandatory impact study in connection with the requirement of prior authorization or declaration, distinguishing between:
    • those activities whose impact on Antarctica’s environment is of more than a minor or transitory nature; to be authorized by French authorities, these require a prior environmental impact assessment;
    • those activities whose impact on the environment is of less than a minor or transitory nature and which only require a simple declaration.

1.1. Declaration of activity
Any projected activity presenting less than a minor or transitory environmental impact falls under the declaration requirement. At least four months prior to the scheduled start date for the activity, a declaration package must be sent to the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories (Terres australes et Antarctiques françaises -TAAF). 
The file attached to the declaration shall include:
    • the name, corporate name, address and all relevant references for the proposed activity leader;
    • a statement by petitioner naming the expedition leader;
    • a description of the activity and of all equipments and materials needed to reach the expedition’s goals, specifying its location, timeline and execution modalities;
    • the document per which the expedition leader promises to provide the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories with activity reports and report on any incidents;
    • a description of waste management measures designed in compliance with Annex III of the Madrid Protocol on waste disposal and management;
    • a certificate of assurance for civil liability coverage of the activity leader, provided by an insurance company, or a statement stipulating equivalent guarantee provided by the State.
The Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories may oppose any requested activity within two months of its reception of the declaration package. The declaration is then sent on to the Foreign Affairs Ministry who informs all state parties to the Antarctic Treaty. Declarations are published once a year in the Journal Officiel de la République Française (JORF).
In the event that an activity requiring authorization was merely declared, the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories must reclassify it under authorization request and require compliance by its author with the authorization request procedure within defined deadlines.
1.2. Activity authorization
Any activity with at least a minor or transitory impact on the environment falls under the authorization regime. The package accompanying the authorization request must include the following:
    • the name, corporate name, address and all relevant references about the natural person or legal entity in charge of the projected activity;
    • a petitioner certificate specifying the expedition leader;
    • a preliminary assessment or, in case of  more than a minor or transitory environmental impact of the activity, a draft global impact assessment in compliance with the provisions of article 2 paragraph 1 or article 3 paragraph 2 of Annex I to the Madrid Protocol on environmental impact assessment;
    • the document per which the expedition leader promises to provide the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories with activity reports and report on any incident;
    • a description of waste management measures designed in compliance with the provisions of Annex III of the Madrid Protocol on waste disposal and management;
    • an emergency plan with contingency measures for environmental protection in the event of an incident;
    • a certificate  of assurance for civil liability coverage of the activity leader, provided by an insurance company, or a statement stipulating equivalent guarantee provided by the State
Procedures will vary depending on the prior environmental impact assessment:
* when the authorization application package includes a preliminary environmental impact assessment, it must be sent to the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories at least five months before the beginning of the activity. In turn, he consults the Committee of the Polar Environment (CPE) who provides comments within two months. In the event that the administration provides no response within four months of the request, the request is considered as de facto rejected;
* when the authorization application package includes a global environment assessment –as is the case when a projected activity will cause more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment- the application request must be submitted one year prior to the start of the activity. The project is submitted for consultation to the CPE and then it is published in the Journal officiel (JORF) and any other relevant publication. It is sent on to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who then passes it to the Environment Protection Committee to allow its review by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meeting. Later on, it is up to the petitioner to prepare a final global environmental impact assessment taking these consultations into account. 
Depending on the final assessment, the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories may authorize the activity. The authorization decision and the global impact assessment are then commented on; these observations are published in the Journal officiel (JORF) and made available to the public. In the event of no response within two months of receipt of the final global environmental impact assessment, it is considered as implicit rejection of the authorization request. 
In any case of disagreement between the opinions of the Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories and the PEC on an authorization request, the decision is made by the Minister of the Environment.
No activity may be considered without a prior declaration or authorization, and a series of administrative and criminal sanctions have been established. 
2. Potential sanctions
When the leader of the declared or authorized activity does not operate in compliance with the terms of the declaration or authorization, administrative sanctions may be applied, including suspension, abrogation or modification of the authorization.
Criminal sanctions may be used to avoid:
    • organizing an activity that either was not preauthorized or ignored the terms of such authorization (one year jail term and €75,000.00  fine);
    • drilling or mining mineral resources in Antarctica except when those activities are carried out for scientific research purposes within the limits of the authorization that was granted; 
    • marketing materials from an illegal mineral resource mining or drilling activity in Antarctica  (two years jail term and € 30,000.00 fine) and 
    • radioactive waste introduction or disposal in Antarctica (two year jail term and € 75,000.00 fine). 
III. Area protection and management
France approved6 Annex V to the Madrid Protocol on area protection and management transposed in part by the April 15th, 2003 law and the April 28th, 2005 decree. This annex was published in the Journal officiel (JORF) under a decree dated August 23rd, 20057. Article R.714-1 of the Environment Code specifies designation modalities for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas spelled out in Annex V of the Madrid Protocol.
Upon proposal of the Environmental Ministry, and following consultation of the Research Minister and the Polar Environment Committee and, as needed, of the Conseil national de la protection de la nature (National Board for the Protection of Nature), the Minister for Foreign Affairs will then initiate the process for Designation of Specially Protected Areas in Antarctica and publication of their management plans. 
Similarly, upon proposal of the Environmental Ministry, and following consultation of the Committee for the Polar Environment and, as needed, of the Commission supérieure des sites, perspectives et paysages (High Commission of Sites, Perspectives and Landscapes), the Minister for Foreign Affairs will initiate the process for Designation of Specially Protected Areas in Antarctica and publication of their management plans. 
IV- Misc. regulatory measures
While the law of April 15th, 2003, complemented by the April 28th, 2005 decree is France’s main framework for the protection of the Antarctic environment, other regulatory measures are used to reinforce it. Some of them deal with the entry into force of treaties adopted outside the Antarctic Treaty System. Others still in the adoption process deal with implementation of measures adopted on the basis of the Antarctic Treaty.
    • Outside the Antarctic Treaty System, France also opted to become involved in waste exportation, albatross and petrel protection and marine pollution:
    • France reaffirmed its ban on the export of any waste product inside the Antarctic Treaty Zone with the introduction in its internal legal system of the Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal signed in Basel on March 22nd, 19898 ;
    • The Convention for the protection of albatross and petrels (ACAP) adopted in Cape town on February 2nd, 2001 and entered into force on February 1st, 2004, was approved by France 9before its publication in the Journal officiel (JORF) in 200510;
    • Amendments to the annex to the 1978 Protocol to the 1973 International Convention for the prevention of ship pollution by designating the Antarctic area a Special Area under the MARPOL convention, were published by a decree of May 31st, 199711.
    • France continues to build  up its environmental protection regulations: 
    • Internal procedures for the ratification of Annex VI to the Protocol on the “ responsibility stemming from critical environment situations”, adopted in Stockholm in June 2005, were initiated; 
    • Furthermore, France initiated an approval procedure for a number of Measures for the protection of certain areas adopted during prior meetings of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings. (See Information Document IP     , “Annual report submitted by France in compliance with Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty”, XXXth ATCM, 2007).
V- French stakeholders for environmental protection in Antarctica
Effective implementation of these legal provisions requires the intervention of various stakeholders. Each one of them is entrusted with a specific environmental protection assignment.
The Prefect in charge of French Southern and Antarctic Territories (TAAF)
Since the 2003 constitutional reform, the TAAF are registered under Article 72-3 of the 1958 French Constitution12; in compliance with this article, the status of TAAF, based on the August 6th, 1955 law, were recently updated in order to specify their particular legislative and administrative structures. 
The organic law13 and the ordinary law14 dated February 21st, 2007 including a number of institutional and statutory provisions relative to overseas territories upgrade the TAAF status.
The administrative agency which manages TAAF territories remains the TAAF Senior administrator, both as representative of the State and as Head of the territory.
In the field of environment protection, the Prefect in charge of Southern and Antarctic Territories may grant authorizations and review declarations to improve monitoring of declared or authorized activities. 
Committee for Polar Environment (CPE)
Established by a 1993 decree15 amended in 200216, the Committee for Polar Environment (CPE) falls under the Minister of the Environment. The CEP was renewed by a January 26th, 2005 decree17 and it held its first session on October 3rd, 2005. It comprises a chairman and ten persons appointed by the Prime minister for a renewable four-year term and selected for their scientific and technological skills in the field of the environment (two of them were proposals by the minister of Foreign Affairs, two were submitted by the minister of the Environment, two came from the minister in charge  of Overseas Departments and Territories, two upon proposal of the minister of Research and two upon proposal of the National Council for the Protection of Nature).
The Committee meets at least once a year (usually more often). It reviews the French government human activity register in Polar and sub-Antarctic areas and their compatibility with environmental preservation. The CPE is consulted regarding the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas defined by Annex V to the Madrid Protocol. 
It is also consulted on activity programs, major projects and impact studies concerning any and all human activities in these areas. It carries out a continuous and regular monitoring of human activities and reviews emergency plans and inspection reports. The Committee may also be consulted about al issues related to the polar environment. 
The Committee for Polar Environment is consulted about activity programs, major projects and impact studies about any and all human activities in Polar and sub-Antarctic areas. It carries out a continuous and regular monitoring of human activities and reviews emergency plans and inspection reports. The Committee may also be consulted about all issues related to polar environment, and it may decide of its own initiative to review any question in its purview.
The CPE must provide its opinion on all environmental impact assessments carried out under requests of activities in Antarctica presented to the TAAF Senior administrator, the administrative entity entrusted with authorization delivery. In the event that the Prefect and TAAF Senior administrator does not agree with the PEC opinion, the issue is submitted to the Minister of the Environment for arbitration.
The Ministry of Foreign Affaires
The sub-division on the Law of the Sea, Fisheries and Antarctica of the Legal division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was given jurisdiction over any issue related to Antarctica18. It also has jurisdiction over any internal issue relating to the seas, fisheries and marine depths. 
The Ministry for Ecology and Sustainable Development
Arbitration jurisdiction on activity authorizations in Antarctica is granted to the Ministry in charge of the Environment (See paragraphs above about activity authority and the Committee for Polar Environment).
Two agencies inside the Ministry are more deeply involved: 
High Commission on Sites, Perspectives and Landscapes
Established by the law of May 2nd, 1930 (articles L 341-1 to 341-22 of the Environmental Code), the High Commission on Sites, Perspectives and Landscapes has undergone a number of modifications19 since its creation. The Commission’s main mission is to advise on projected site classification as well as proposed works on classified sites due to their crucial importance or their exemplary character. The Minister may refer to it any questions about sites, perspectives and landscapes. It may also, of its own initiative, express wishes. Among other things, it reviews major site operation projects.
In terms of protection of the Antarctic environment protection, the Commission may be consulted within the context of the designation of Antarctic Specially Managed areas and of the publication of management plans for these areas.
National Council for the Protection of Nature
Established in 1978, the Conseil national de la protection de la nature falls under the Minister in charge of the protection of nature (article R133-1 to. 133-22 of the Environmental Code). It studies and advises on projects and legislative and regulatory texts related to wildlife and natural space preservation, including establishment of reservations. With regard to protection of the Antarctic environment, the Council may be consulted in the framework of designation of Antarctic Specially Managed Areas and of the publication of management plans for these areas.
The Paul-Emile Victor French Polar Institute (IPEV)
French research activities presently carried out in Antarctica are coordinated, supported and implemented by the IPEV.
The IPEV brings together scientific expertise on polar environment and supports the set up of “observatory” type long-time research programs and collection of data on monitoring of the Antarctic environment, in compliance with the recommendations of the Madrid Protocol.
The Polar Institute was established in January 1992 upon joint initiative of overseas and research ministries under the name of Institut Français pour la Recherche et les Technologies Polaires (IFRTP) (French Institute for Polar Research and Technology) through the merger of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories Research Mission and the French Polar Expeditions20. In January 2002, it was extended for a 12-year period under the name of the Paul-Emile Victor French Polar Institute.
