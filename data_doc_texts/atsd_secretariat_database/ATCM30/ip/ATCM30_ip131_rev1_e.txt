Status of the Argentine Icebreaker “Almirante Irízar"

On April 14, 2007, fire broke out in the generator area of the icebreaker “Almirante Irizar” at 20:20, while it was sailing in waters under Argentina’s jurisdiction (approximately 42° 30’ S). 
As the fire could not be controlled, and in view of the potential danger to people aboard, orders were given to evacuate the ship with the use of lifeboats.  Between 5 and 8 hours later, the crew and the passengers were rescued by the Argentine fishing vessels “Magritte” and “Don Cayetano” and the Panamanian oil tanker “Scarlet Ibis”.  No missing persons or fatalities were reported.
The people were taken to Puerto Madryn in the Chubut Province, where they were subjected to a medical evaluation and given medical attention.
After the fire was extinguished and the hull cooled, the “Almirante Irizar” was towed from the area of the incident to Puerto Belgrano in the Buenos Aires Province, where it arrived on the night of April 20th. 
Currently, inquiries prescribed by Argentine law are being conducted, and damages to the vessel caused by the fire are being evaluated.
