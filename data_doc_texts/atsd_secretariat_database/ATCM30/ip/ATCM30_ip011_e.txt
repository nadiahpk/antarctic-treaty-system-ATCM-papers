This paper provides an update on results of the Antarctic Site Inventory project through February 2007. The Antarctic Site Inventory has collected biological data and site-descriptive information in the Antarctic Peninsula since 1994. 
The project's methodology, results, and updates from previous field seasons have been described and discussed in XIX ATCM/IP 47, XX ATCM/IP 100, XX ATCM/IP 102, XXI ATCM/IP 114, XXII ATCM/IP 27, XXIII/IP 32, XXV ATCM/IP 25, XXVI ATCM/IP 53, XXVII ATCM/IP 10, XXVII ATCM/WP 11, XXVIII ATCM/IP 22, and XXIX ATCM/IP 27.
1. Introduction
The Antarctic Site Inventory began fieldwork in November 1994, examining whether opportunistic visits can be used: to effectively and economically detect possible visitor-caused changes in the physical features, flora, and fauna of sites in the Antarctic Peninsula being visited repeatedly by ship-based tourists; to collect baseline information necessary to detect possible changes in the physical and biological variables being monitored; and to determine how best to minimize or avoid possible environmental impacts of tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Peninsula area.
The Antarctic Site Inventory has demonstrated an ability to reach Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites frequently and cost-effectively, relying opportunistically on expedition tour vessels and, occasionally, the United Kingdom ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance for logistics support. Well-timed visits by trained researchers have proved an effective means of characterizing sites and for collecting relevant biological data (Naveen, 1997a; Naveen, et. al, 2001; Naveen, 2003).
Data collected by the Inventory are intended to assist the implementation of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which, among other things, requires a priori environmental impact assessments for all human activities, including tourism, and for monitoring to be done, as and when necessary, to assess and verify predicted environmental impacts. There is a focus on the “initial environmental reference state” of particular locations, which in the case of tourism, would refer to places where shipboard passengers are visiting. The environmental concern is identifying changes to the baseline reference state and, if possible, determining whether any detected changes are naturally occurring or are anthropogenic, perhaps caused by tourism or other human activities. Potential impacts may be short-term or long-term, immediate or cumulative. (Benninghoff and Bonner, 1985; Abbott and Benninghoff, 1990; SCAR, 1996; Emslie, 1997; Hofman and Jatko, 2002).
2. Results
In 13 seasons from November 1994 through February 2007, the Inventory has made 784 visits and collected data at 113 Antarctic Peninsula locations. During the recently concluded 2006-07 field season, the Inventory made 80 visits and collected data at 41 sites, including 10 sites not previously visited by Inventory researchers.
There have been repetitive visits to all of the visitor sites that are most heavily visited by expedition tourists, and to all sites which exhibit the most species diversity and which are most prone to potential environmental disturbance from human visitors. (Naveen: 1997a; Naveen: 2003; Naveen, et. al, 2001; Naveen, unpublished field data, 2003-06). The Inventory regularly censuses the 12 visitor locations for which site guidelines were adopted at ATCM XXIX (Resolution 2). 
3. Species Trends, Analyses
With respect to blue-eyed shags (Phalacrocorax atriceps), the Inventory identified a downward population trend during the 1990s throughout the Antarctic Peninsula, irrespective of whether sites experienced many or few tourist visits. (Naveen, et. al, 2000). With respect to gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), the Inventory continues to document the population increase and range expansion of this species in the Peninsula region (Naveen, et. al, 2000; Naveen, unpublished field data, 1994-07). With respect to Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), the Inventory continues to document the population decline of this species in the western Antarctic Peninsula region (Naveen, et. al, 2000; Naveen, unpublished field data, 1994-07).
In collaboration with the University of Maryland, Oceanites has begun an effort to utilize hierarchical Bayesian modeling and other, cutting-edge statistical and global information system (GIS) techniques to analyze the 13-year-old Antarctic Site Inventory database in the context of other extant, long-term Peninsula datasets and to better understand how Peninsula biological and physical processes, as well as direct/cumulative impacts from human activities, may connect. 
4. Logistics
As noted above, the Inventory places research teams aboard expedition vessels operating in the Peninsula during the austral spring and summer. Expedition ships are selected carefully, particularly those with the longest Peninsula itineraries, whose Initial Environmental Evaluations have been reviewed by national authorities, and whose operations and expedition personnel enable Inventory researchers to reach the most heavily visited sites and to collect data at key census times (the peak of egg-laying for nest counts and the peak of chick-crèching for chick counts). By a cooperative arrangement with Lindblad Expeditions, Inc., Inventory researchers have collected census data from the 2000-01 season to date on all Antarctic departures of that company’s expedition vessel, the National Geographic Endeavour. Site visits and aerial photodocumentation have been undertaken in cooperation with HMS Endurance. (Naveen: 1996, 1997a, 1999, 2003). 
The 2006-07 austral spring/summer was the fourth field season for the Inventory’s focused assessment and monitoring program at Petermann Island (65°10’S, 64°10’), a frequently visited Peninsula location that is diverse in species composition and sensitive to potential environmental disruptions from visitors. This research began in November 2003, pursuant to a 5-year grant award from the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Office of Polar Programs.
5. Geographic Coverage, Methodology
The Inventory divides the Antarctic Peninsula into six subareas: South Orkney Islands, including Laurie, Coronation, and Signy Islands; Elephant Island and nearby islands; Northeast Antarctic Peninsula/northwestern Weddell Sea (from Cape Dubouzet, 63˚16’S, 64˚00’W to James Ross Island); South Shetland Islands (including Deception, Low, and Smith Islands); Northwest Antarctic Peninsula (from Cape Dubouzet, 63˚16’S, 64˚00’W, the northern end of the Lemaire Channel); and Southwest Antarctic Peninsula (from the north end of the Lemaire Channel to the northern part of Marguerite Bay, 68˚18’S, 67˚11’W).
The Inventory’s methodology is fully described in the Compendium of Antarctic Peninsula Visitor Sites, 2d edition: A Report To The United States Environmental Protection Agency (Naveen, 2003). The Inventory collects three categories of data and information: Basic Site Information, which includes descriptions of key physical and topographical characteristics; latitude and longitude; distribution of flora, seal haul-out and wallow locations, and discrete groups of breeding penguins and flying birds; Variable Site Information and Data, which includes weather and other environmental conditions (sea ice extent, cloud cover, snow cover, temperature, wind direction and speed), biological variables (number of occupied nests, number of chicks per occupied nest, ages of chicks), and the nature and extent of any observed visitor impacts (footprints or paths, cigarette butts, film canisters, and litter); and  Maps and Photodocumentation, which portray the major features of each site, particularly the locations of colonies and assemblages of resident fauna and flora.
With respect to penguins and flying birds, the focus is collecting data on the key biological variables of breeding population size (nest counts) and breeding productivity (number of chicks per active nest), which are the appropriate biological parameters for detecting direct and cumulative impacts on these populations. In these regards, data collection follows Standard Methods established by the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) (Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, 2004), and with reference to other pertinent authorities, in particular, The Distribution of Penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula and Islands of the Scotia Sea (Croxall, J. P. and E.D. Kirkwood, 1979) and The Distribution and Abundance of Antarctic and Subantarctic Penguins (Woehler, E.J., 1993).
6. Dissemination Of Data And Information, Publications
Biological data and site descriptions collected by the Antarctic Site Inventory have been published and routinely are made available in peer-reviewed papers, government reports, and popular publications. The most recent government report is the Compendium of Antarctic Peninsula Visitor Sites, 2d edition: A Report To The United States Environmental Protection Agency (Naveen, 2003), which compiles site descriptions and data relating to the 82 sites visited/censused by the Antarctic Site Inventory through February 2003. Details include: the number of visitor sites experiencing zodiac landings; where such landings are concentrated; the sites exhibiting the most species diversity; and the sites which are most sensitive to potential environmental disruptions.
Data and information about the Antarctic Site Inventory are also available on the recently launched Oceanites website — www.oceanites.org
In addition, Oceanites researchers are presently working on a number of papers to be submitted for publication: Range expansion of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and the declining population of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in the Antarctic Peninsula; Alternative approaches to understanding spatial and temporal changes in seabird populations in the Antarctic Peninsula; and Censuses of penguin, blue-eyed shag (Phalacrocorax atriceps), and southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) censuses in the Antarctic Peninsula, 1994-2007.
