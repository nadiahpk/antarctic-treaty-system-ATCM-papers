Studies in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean:
 India’s initiative and future Plans
Introduction
The Southern Ocean (SO), defined as the oceanic area south of 35°S, is known to be a very important region in shaping the global climate, due to active atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions. SO is the source for several intermediate and deep-water masses of the world oceans. Many aspects of its circulation, water masses and the response of SO to climate change remain unknown primarily due to the lack of high-resolution ship observations. This has led to a growing interest in the exploration of the SO to understand various geological, physical, chemical and biological processes and their driving mechanisms operating in this region. The SO is characterized by large seasonal variability in its environmental conditions, which influence the global climate. 
Having realized the scientific importance of Southern Ocean (So), India launched scientific expeditions in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean.  Accordingly, two expeditions were launched by the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research 1) Pilot Expedition to SO (Figure 1) onboard ORV Sagar Kanya during austral summer 2004 (January - March) and 2) Expedition to SO/Larsemann Hills (Antarctica) onboard Akademic Boris Petrov during austral summer 2006 (January – April). Water sampling at various depths was carried out to measure nutrients, cocolithophorid population. Multibeam swath bathymetric data was collected along the ships track. The major scientific investigations included the areas of biogeochemistry, atmosphere, and physical oceanography, geological & geophysical oceanographic measurements. The main objectives of the biogeochemical measurements included assessing water column particulate organic carbon, nitrogen fluxes, phytoplankton and micro-zooplankton, primary productivity, chlorophyll, benthic community, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen etc. Further, atmospheric and physical oceanographic measurements included measurements of surface meteorological parameters, upper air measurements, aerosols, current pattern, thermal structure, thermohaline circulation etc. The geological and geophysical measurements included collection of piston and gravity cores for palaeoclimatic studies. National Laboratories and Institutes and Universities of India participated with NCAOR as the nodal agency.  Some scientific results have been published based on the two expeditions. 
Objectives and Rationale for the work
Since the pole ward transport of heat from subtropics was predominantly promoted by the higher degree of horizontal variability in the heat content between the subtropics and polar region, perhaps this is the major cause for the global climatic changes. Hence more information regarding the temperature variability from tropics to polar region is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the climatic variability.  The following objectives are made for a comprehensive understanding of the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean.

Hydrodynamics of the study region
    • Illustrate the long-term variability in heat transport from subtropics polar region
    •  Current structure and variability
    • Thermohaline circulation, Water masses structure
    • Comprehensive understanding (north-south variability) of ACC in the southern Ocean
Biological Oceanography 
    • The latitudinal variation of the natural 15N content of planktons. 
    • New production and f ratios
    • Estimate the strength and efficiency of the biological pump.
    • Quantify the effect of iron fertilization on the new production. 
    • Estimate the extent of summer melting of the Antarctic ices sheet and mixing 
    • To assess the chlorophyll concentration in the Indian sector 
    • To define the algal classes by in situ data collection (normally algal classes are done microscopically only)
    •  To map the spatial distribution of the diatoms.
Chemical oceanography
    • To study the vertical and horizontal distribution of total suspended matter (TSM) inn SO to understand source and transport of materials. 
    • To study vertical and horizontal distribution of nutrients.
    • Estimate the extent of summer melting of the Antarctic ices sheet and mixing
    • To collect samples of the water column so as to ascertain the distribution of coccolithophores (calcareous) and diatoms (siliceous).
Geological oceanography
    • To collect sediment samples (surface sediments and sediment cores) in different oceanographic regimes, especially frontal areas
We planned to undertake expedition to SO in the International Polar Year during austral summer of 2007-2008 where the main thrust would be the Ocean Atmosphere interaction and its relationship to the biotic regime of SO. To accomplish this we would be collecting routine atmospheric data along with underway observations which includes following ;
Atmospheric Measurements: Continuous measurements of surface meteorological parameters using Automatic Weather Station (AWS). Upper air measurements, optical measurements of aerosols their nature and distribution, measurements on atmospheric electricity will be carried out.  
Physical Measurements: Measurements of temperature, salinity, optical transmission, fluorescence, irradiance, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll concentrations and currents. For time series measurements mooring current meters shall be deployed during 2007-2008.
Bio-Chemical measurements: Water column studies would be carried out for particulate organic carbon and nitrogen fluxes, phytoplankton and micro-zooplankton, their enumeration and taxonomy Studies on bacterial abundance and productivity as also net community production in the study area. New production assessment would be carried out by deck incubation following standard practices by N-15 uptake. Biologists are also keen to assess the benthic community so as to ascertain the effect of bottom waters. It is also planned to undertake the nutrient structure in the SO. 

Geological and Geophysical Measurements: Acquisition of gravity, magnetic and multi-beam swath bathymetric data. Sediment cores shall be collected for late Quaternary sedimentary sections for reconstruction of palaeoclimatic records.
