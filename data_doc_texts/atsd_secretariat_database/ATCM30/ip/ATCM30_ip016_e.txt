Ecuador’s National Policy Proposal 
for Antarctica  




Ecuador’s National Policy Proposal 
for Antarctica  
Background  
Ecuador’s National Foreign Policy Plan 2006-2020 (PLANEX 2020) includes, as one of its strategic  guidelines, the coordination of Ecuador’s presence in Antarctica, through active participation
in bodies of the Antarctic Treaty System and the execution of scientific research programs in Antarctica.
 The group of expeditions conducted by Ecuador in Antarctica, the establishment and operation of the scientific station “Pedro Vicente Maldonado,” as well as the realization of various scientific projects --whose aims are to understand the Antarctic environment, protect it, and establish the relationship between Antarctica and climatic variability in the Southeast Pacific, and the role of the austral continent in climate change, specifically in relation to the accelerated sea level rise along the South American coast-- are part of a process initiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ecuadorian Navy.  The objective of this process was to carry out Ecuador’s national interests in Antarctica, interests that Ecuador has had since 27 February 1967, with the National Constituent Assembly’s Declaration of Sovereignty, but that have only now become a reality, placing the country within the group of nations that conduct research in Antarctica within the spirit of participation, promotion, and cooperation.  The purpose of the research is to learn about Antarctica’s ecosystems, evaluate its resources, and fully understand the oceanic and atmospheric processes that connect Antarctica with the rest of the terrestrial world, processes that affect climate, living resources and productive activities, and the livelihoods of human beings.  Increased knowledge of Antarctica will ensure that use of its resources and human activities do not harm the environment, which despite its hostility, is also fragile. 
The initiative of the Ministry and of the Navy came to fruition when on 16 June 1987 the Honorable National Congress, through a resolution published in the Official Gazette No. 714 of 24 June 1987, unanimously approved Ecuador’s accession to the Antarctic Treaty.  A few weeks later, the Constitutional President, through Executive Decree No. 3126 of 5 August 1987, published in the Official Gazette No. 747 of 12 August 12 of the same year, adhered the country to said legal-political instrument.  As a result, the National Navy took charge of the first Ecuadorian expedition to Antarctica during the austral summer of 1988.  Subsequently, and with a view to sustaining Ecuador’s activities, in July 1988, the Sectorial Commission for  Antarctic Research, a body for the management of scientific activity dependent on the National Counsel of Science and Technology, was created.  Through the Agreement of the Ministry of National Defense No. 1508 of 1 August 1988, the Ecuadorian National Antarctic Program, a body for operational and logistical management dependent on the Institute of Oceanography of the Navy, was created.  Both bodies assumed responsibility for Antarctic matters, and there were immediate results.  On 19 November 1990, Ecuador was accepted as a Consultative Member of the Antarctic Treaty, and on 15 June 1992, as a full Member of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research.  
The Antarctic Treaty is a legal framework in which States have rights and duties, expressed through the realization of activities for peaceful and scientific purposes on any part of the continent or south of 60° S, and the promotion of and joint participation in research in a region of the world that conserves intact the history of Planet Earth, and that plays a major role in the control of global climate, but that is also vulnerable to anthropogenic activities. 
It is through research that States express their geopolitical interests in the continent, but within the framework established by the Antarctic Treaty, its Conventions, Protocols, and Consultative Meetings. Therefore, the fundamental principles on which Ecuador’s national policy should be based must be consistent with said instrument, whose important points are summarized as follows: 
    • that Antarctica “be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose”; 
    • that in Antarctica “freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation” among active members and those interested in the continent continue; 
    • that it maintains the prohibition of “nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes”; that the Antarctic environment be specially protected through a continued effort to conserve its ecosystems; and finally, that the Antarctic Treaty and its associated and complementary instruments that constitute the Antarctic Treaty System be observed and strengthened.  
Ecuador’s position on Antarctica, on the area to which the Treaty applies, and on Ecuadorian activities in relation to the continent should consider the following guidelines:
    a) In the area to which the Antarctic Treaty applies, Ecuador has interests that are expressed in its National Policy and in the Strategic Plan of the Antarctic Institute of Ecuador for the 2007-2011 period.  The national objectives for Antarctica seek to make these interests compatible with those of the other Signatories to the Treaty;
    b) As long as the Antarctic Treaty is in force, Ecuador abides by what is established in Article IV Section 2, concerning claims to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica, however Ecuador reserves the right to protect its direct and substantive interests in Antarctica;
    c) The claims of territorial sovereignty formulated before the Antarctic Treaty’s entrance into force cannot interfere with compliance to its provisions, nor can they constitute obstacles to future  activities of economic character that are realized under the protection of the Treaty and other related international instruments that are accepted by the Parties;
    d) Ecuador is a developing country.  This situation must be taken into account in order to facilitate its activities in the context of the Antarctic Treaty, and its participation in those activities concerning Antarctic economic resources; and 
    e) The National Foreign Policy Plan 2006-2020 is compatible with the instruments that  make up the Antarctic Treaty.   
It is possible to establish the concept of a National Policy for Antarctica:
The national policy for Antarctic matters is based on affirming and maintaining the presence of Ecuador in Antarctica, in the promotion of, participation and cooperation in scientific research, in preserving and protecting the Antarctic environment, and in evaluating and using its resources in accordance with the guidelines, considerations, and commitments established for the area of the Antarctic Treaty System.  
As of 2004, Ecuador has put this concept into practice through a mechanism constituted by the Antarctic Institute of Ecuador --created through Executive Decree No. 1610 on 29 April 2004 and published in the Official Gazette No. 326 of 3 May of the same year-- as a body of public law, appointed to the Ministry of National Defense, located in the city of Guayaquil, with patrimony and its own funds, with a view to fomenting and maintaining the geopolitical outlook of the country and its permanent participation in scientific research activities in the context of the Antarctic Treaty System.  The Institute has an Office for Coordination and Policy composed of a Governing Board, Executive Office, Scientific-Technical Departments, and an Administrative-Financial Department.  As well, there is an Office of General Counsel composed of a Scientific Advisory Group made up of researchers selected from various academic institutions and public and private research centers, structured under the same guidelines and principles as SCAR, and regulated by its own rules.
In relation to Antarctica, Ecuador maintains the following objectives and specific policies:
1. Promote the active participation of Ecuador in Antarctica for purposes of scientific research and based on national interests.  
Policies:
    a) Support the continuation of the Antarctic Treaty and contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of the of the System emanating from the Treaty;
    b) Consolidate the institutionality of the state in what concerns Antarctic matters, in accordance with the needs of mutual cooperation and support required by the Treaty, and strengthen the Antarctic Institute of Ecuador;
    c) Make available human and material resources, expressed as infrastructure, and scientific and support staff to attend to the needs of Antarctic science;       
    d) Strengthen the National Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research of Ecuador, so that it may prepare scientific research programs and projects with the utmost excellence that, in the framework of bilateral, regional, and international programs and projects, adhere to national interests covering all of Antarctica; 
    e) Foment and promote the participation of citizens and civil society in Antarctic matters, motivating people to participate in controlled tourism and to learn about the environments and ecosystems of the continent;  
    f) Disseminate Ecuador’s Antarctic activities, especially results from scientific research in Antarctica, in national and international contexts, with special attention to the education of scholastic and university groups, and to the young scientists of Ecuador;                   
    g) Sponsor the training of managers, scientists, and technicians in the areas of logistical, operational, and environmental matters, in order to attend efficiently and effectively to Antarctic matters;     
    h) Promote the involvement of universities and academic organizations, research groups and the productive sector in Antarctic science and technology to strengthen the sustainability and guarantee the quality of Ecuador’s activities in Antarctica;  
    i) Contribute to the strengthening of academic research centers, public and private, so that these can adapt to continuous changes in science and contribute to Antarctic activities with new technologies; and 
    j) Participate in scientific and technological exchange, transfer, and dissemination in the legal framework of the Antarctic Treaty System and of the conventions of bilateral, subregional, regional, and international integration. 
2. Contribute, alongside the efforts of the members of the Antarctic Treaty, to the preservation of the Antarctic environment.
