IAATO Information Outreach to Private One-off Non-Member Expeditions 

Introduction
Each season there is an increasing number of small one-off private yacht visits and other programs to the Antarctic. The majority of these take place on small sailing yachts or private luxury motor yachts and many of these private expeditions are unaware of the obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System.
In line with IAATO’s objectives:
    • To advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible travel to the Antarctic;
    • To circulate, promote and follow the Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic and Guidance for Those Organizing and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic, as adopted by the Antarctic Treaty System (Recommendation XVIII-1);
    • To operate within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System, including the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on the Environment and Annexes, along with MARPOL, SOLAS and similar international and national laws and agreements; 
    • To provide a forum for the international, private-sector travel industry to share expertise and opinions and to uphold the highest standards among members; 
    • To enhance public awareness and concern for the conservation of the Antarctic environment and its associated ecosystems and to better inform the media, governments and environmental organizations about private-sector travel to these regions. 
IAATO has developed a series of out reach materials with the intention of informing private one-off non-member expeditions. 

Information Posters
A series of Information posters have been developed (See Appendix 1-4) covering the following: 
    • Recommendation XVIII-1 in addition to some IAATO specific recommendations for code of conduct ashore;
    • IAATO Boot and Clothing Decontamination Guidelines;
    • IAATO Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines (Parts 1 & 2). 
In addition a further leaflet on the recently reviewed Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines has been created (see Appendix 5). The intention of these posters and leaflets is to not only have them available on each IAATO vessel, but also to have members circulate them at specific gateway ports.

One Off Yacht Package
A package of information for one-off yacht visitors was piloted during the 2006-07 season, with three vessels signing up. IAATO’s aim in providing this package was to ensure that all visitors have ready access to all the critical information required for safe and environmentally responsible operation. These expeditions were not IAATO members, however.

The package of information included, but was not exclusive to:

    • A letter of ‘must knows’ for visiting  Antarctica, including both core background information as well as practical day to day operational information.
    • A full list of documents, including Antarctic Treaty documents, which visitors need to be aware of and/or carry onboard (for example, the Protocol, Recommendation XVIII-1, Site Guidelines etc.);
    • IAATO guidelines on various aspects of operations to ensure minimal impact on the special environment of Antarctica;
    • Contact information for all IAATO tour vessels operating in Antarctica;
    • Tour vessel schedules for landings at specific sites.

In addition throughout the season updates, alerts and any further relevant information was distributed as and when required. A small administrative fee was charged. 

While the pilot scheme did take steps to ensure that these vessels were better informed, lessons have been learned in terms of improving and simplifying the communication. IAATO intends to continue with this package of information next season. 

In conclusion

IAATO hopes that these two initiatives will help ensure good communication and dispersion of necessary information to all one off private expeditions to the Antarctic. IAATO would be pleased to work with Antarctic Treaty Parties to enhance the dissemination of this information.
