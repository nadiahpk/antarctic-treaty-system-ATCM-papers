Progress Report on the Discussion of the International Working Group about Possibilities for Environmental Management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island

submitted by
Germany and Chile
1. Introduction
At CEP VII Germany introduced IP 005, “Research Project Risk assessment for the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island and the development of management plans for designation as Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed Areas’”. This paper described a three-year research project (2003 – 2006) to provide data to fully evaluate the role and structure of a possible broad-scale management system on Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island. The project has been carried out by scientists of the Polar and Bird Ecology Group at the Institute of Ecology, University of Jena, Germany. Several CEP members expressed their support for the proposal, and indicated that they would willingly assist Germany in the project.
At CEP VIII Germany introduced IP 016, “Progress Report on the Research Project Risk assessment for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island and the development of management plans for designation as Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed Areas”. This paper provided an update of the project, noting the excellent co-operation with other Parties in the area through an informal co-ordination group. Germany also indicated its intent to submit a draft ASMA plan for consideration to CEP IX.
At ATCM XXVIII, “Germany agreed that prior to tabling a draft Management Plan for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island (King George Island) and following a proposal by Chile an International Working Group should be established, composed of those Parties with stations and/or huts in the area, Parties with an interest in the area as well as Observers to the Antarctic Treaty. This group will discuss the issues related to the Draft Management Plan. With this purpose, Germany will carry out two international workshops, one in September 2005 and another one in January/February 2006, in order to convene the participants on this issue” (Final Report of ATCM XXVIII, para. 90).
At CEP IX Brazil, China, Germany, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation introduced WP022, “Possibilities for Environmental Management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island. Proposal to establish an Intersessional Contact Group”. This paper reported on the main findings and recommendations of the King George Island Workshop “Possibilities for Environmental Management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island” in January/February 2006 as well as on the outcome of the Workshop “Human impact on terrestrial habitats in the Antarctic” in September 2005”. Discussion of this paper is reflected in paragraphs 70 to 75 of the CEP Report.
At ATCM XXIX “Germany expressed satisfaction on reaching agreement with Chile in principle on developing an ASMA for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island. They will jointly convene – via note verbal – an international working group (paragraph 74 of the CEP Report). Germany expressed the hope that a substantive outcome of the group’s work would be presented to the next ATCM. Chile confirmed that it will host a workshop to prepare the input on this issue for discussion at CEP X.” (Final Report of ATCM XXIX, para. 77)
2. The International Working Group
2.1 General
Pursuant to these understandings an international working group involving government representatives of interested Parties was convened by Germany and Chile in order to discuss management approaches, possibly aiming at drafting a management plan for an ASMA covering the Fildes Peninsula Region. With the assistance of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat a web based Discussion Forum was established.

2.2 Questions uploaded to the web based Discussion Forum 
The convenors uploaded the following questions to the web based Discussion Forum of the CEP at the beginning of the discussion in October 2006:
    • What kind of management approaches for the Fildes Peninsula Region (including Fildes Peninsula, Ardley Island and other adjacent smaller islands) do you suggest? 
    • Which management activities should be included by such an approach? 
    • Which geographical area should be covered by such an approach? 
    • Which timeframe should be taken for implementing your suggested approach?

2.3 Participation
Besides the convenors Chile and Germany, thirteen other parties expressed their wish to join the International Working Group (IWG) dealing with possibilities for environmental management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island. They nominated their national representatives to participate in the IWG (see Table 1).

3. Comments of the parties involved
Table 2 gives a summary of the submitted answers to questions made by the convenors (see 2.2), including both comments made within the Discussion Forum and prior statements made in relevant documents. 

4. Further steps
The participants of IWG intend to continue their work intersessionally at the web based Discussion Forum and meet at agreed intervals and venues scheduled by the members of the Antarctic Treaty System, taking into account inter alia data provided by the results of:
    • the Workshop “Scientific Cooperation, Environmental Protection, Coordination of Activities in the Fildes Peninsula Region, King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica (Punta Arenas, 29-31 March 2007), 
    • the final report of the German Research Project “Risk Assessment for the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island and the development of management plans for designation as Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed Areas” (ca. May 2007), and 
    • the review by the CEP of the draft management plan for ASPA Nº 150 (Ardley Island).
