Annual Report of Spain Pursuant to 
Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection 
to the Antarctic Treaty





Annual Report of Spain Pursuant to Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty   
Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires that annually each Party inform the Committee for Environmental Protection of the measures adopted to fulfill said Protocol. 
This report contains the actions and measures taken by Spain with regards to the different annexes of the Protocol since the last meeting of the Committee.
1. Environmental Impact Assessment (Annex I)
All activities to be carried out in Antarctica, whether they be scientific research projects or any other type of activity within the governmental, nongovernmental, or Antarctic tourism categories, are required to send the Spanish Polar Committee, the body responsible for the approval of Environmental Impact Assessments, a statement form for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), that will permit prior assessment of the activity.
Once the potential impact on the Antarctic environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems has been reviewed, action will be taken in accordance with this Annex.  The activity will be carried out if the anticipated impacts are less than minor or transitory; will be preceded by an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) if the anticipated impacts are equal to minor or transitory; or will be preceded by a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) if the anticipated impacts are more than minor or transitory. 
The Spanish procedure for assessment of the environmental impacts of activities to be carried out in Antarctica, as well as the statement form for the preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment, are available on the Spanish Polar Committee website (http://www.mec.es/ciencia/comPolar) under the tab Normativa Antártica “Normativa particular”
All activities submitted to the Spanish Polar Committee between April 2006 and March 2007 have been evaluated and considered to have a “less than minor or transitory” environmental impact.  Thus, permits were granted so the activities could begin without delay. No Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) or Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) has been prepared.
Table 1 shows the Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEE) for Antarctic activities approved by the Spanish Polar Committee during the period 2006-2007, as is indicated in Article 6 of the present Annex.  
2. Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (Annex II)
All permits issued by the Spanish Polar Committee for the taking of samples or harmful interference with Antarctic fauna and flora have been given solely for the purposes of scientific research or scientific information, and in accordance with the current procedure.
Any Spanish activity that plans on taking of samples, harmful interference, or the introduction of species into Antarctica should complete the request form available on the Spanish Polar Committee website (http://www.mec.es/ciencia/comPolar) under the tab “Normativa Antártica”.
Table 2 shows the permits that have been issued by the Spanish Polar Committee since the last meeting for the taking of samples, harmful interference with Antarctic fauna and flora, and for the introduction of species.   
3. Waste Disposal and Waste Management (Annex III)
Waste disposal and waste management plans exist for Spanish bases and ships.  During the seasons, there is a person responsible for these activities.
The Spanish Antarctic Base Juan Carlos I has special containers for the storage of waste, which is classified according to indications specified on the container.  A system for the treatment of waste waters and an organic waste incinerator are also available.  All waste generated on the base is removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area.  
The waste management plan of the Spanish Antarctic Base Gabriel de Castilla is based on reduction, reuse, separation, storage, and elimination.  Grey waters are treated in a septic tank, and the remaining waste generated is removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area.  
All participants in the Spanish Antarctic seasons are kept informed of all aspects related to waste disposal and treatment and of the requirements of Annex III of the Protocol. 
In agreement with Resolution 6 (2001) on the exchange of information, all information regarding waste management on bases and ships participating in Spanish Antarctic expeditions is available on the website of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (http://www.ats.org.ar).
4. Prevention of Marine Pollution (Annex IV)
One of the operations that has the potential to generate marine pollution involves the transfer of fuel from ships to Spanish bases.  In the Organization Manual of the Las Palmas ship (ship providing logistical support for the Spanish Antarctic season 2006-2007), all emergency situations, as well as contingency plans to mitigate situations of potential danger that could cause environmental damages, are covered.  The two bases also have contingency plans for cases of marine pollution.
5. Area Protection and Management (Annex V)
All Spanish activities that plan on entering an Antarctic Specially Protected Area should send the Spanish Polar Committee a request for entry.  Once evaluated, the corresponding permit, together with management plans for the corresponding areas, will be issued.  The request forms are available on the Web (http://www.mec.es/ciencia/comPolar) under the tab “Normativa Antártica”, as are the management plans for all Protected Areas.
Table 3 shows the permits issued by Spain during the period 2006-2007 for access to and the implementation of activities in Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
At the XXVIII ATCM, Deception Island was designated as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), because of the Spanish Antarctic Base Gabriel de Castilla’s location within the zone.  The requirements of the management plan have been fulfilled.  The activities to be carried out in the area and arrangements are detailed in the corresponding report sent to the Deception Island Management Group.
6. Liability (Annex VI)
The Spanish Government is studying the current legislation, so that it can be adapted to the requirements of this Annex, with a view to its ratification. 
The Spanish Antarctic Bases Juan Carlos I and Gabriel de Castilla and the Las Palmas ship have adopted preventative measures to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies, as well as emergency plans to respond to incidents that may have harmful effects on the Antarctic environment and its associated ecosystems.  
As well, the Spanish Antarctic Base Gabriel de Castilla, located on Deception Island, which is of volcanic origin, has a specific plan for seismic or volcanic emergencies.
