Report on the Implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection as Required by Article 17 of the Protocol
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Introduction

Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires each Party to report annually on the steps that they have taken to implement the Protocol. Such reports should include how each Party has ensured compliance with the Protocol including through the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative actions and enforcement measures (Article 13(3) of the Protocol refers).

Article 17 also requires each Party to report on contingency plans established for response to incidents with potential adverse effects on the Antarctic environment and associated ecosystems (Article 15(1)(b) of the Protocol refers).  Further to this, Resolution 1 (1997) recommends Parties to carry out regular contingency exercises and to report on the results of the exercises.

This report covers all such UK activities and actions for the period 2006-2007.
Administrative Actions

No further primary legislation concerning the Protocol has entered into force in the UK since ATCM XXIII, when it was reported that the provisions of the Antarctic Act 1994 were fully in force.  The 2006-2007 austral season was the ninth season when all of the provisions of the Antarctic Act 1994 were implemented.

The UK is fully up to date with approval of all Measures up to and including ATCM XXV (excluding those on which a deliberate policy decision not to approve has been taken), under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.  Measures 2 and 3 of ATCM XXVI are incorporated into UK law by means of the Antarctic (Amendment) Regulations 2004.

A list of all permits issued under the Antarctic Act 1994 for the 2006-2007 season is attached as an Annex to this paper.

Disaster Contingency Exercise

In accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol and Article 12 of Annex IV, the UK has continued to provide comprehensive oil spill response training, revise and update its oil spill contingency plans, and undertake regular exercises for UK ships and bases in Antarctica.
