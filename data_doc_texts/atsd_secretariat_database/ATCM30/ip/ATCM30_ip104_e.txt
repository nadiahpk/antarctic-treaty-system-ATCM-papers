Japan’s Antarctic Scientific Programs in 2006/07
- Selected Highlights
Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions (JARE) have been organized by Headquarters established in the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).  This Information Paper introduces two highlights from scientific programs carried out by JARE near Syowa Station and Dome Fuji in the 2006/07 season.
1. A new 3,035.22m deep ice core at Dome Fuji Station, Antarctica: reconstruction of global climate and environmental change over the past 720,000 years
On January 26th, 2007, the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition at Dome Fuji station (77˚19’S, 39˚42’S, 3,810m a.s.l.) succeeded in collecting ice core at a depth of 3,035.22m (Figure 1). A previous deep ice core of 2,503m length was drilled at Dome Fuji in December 1996, a record of ice deposition for the past 340,000 years. Due to the lack of drilling liquid for the borehole, the drill seized and could not be recovered. On the assumption that the conditions of snow deposition from the surface to 2,503m deep continues to the bottom of the ice sheet, one million-year-old ice can be expected to lie near the bedrock. For this reason, the second deep ice core drilling at Dome Fuji was started with the aim of drilling down to the bedrock. The new drilling site was constructed and ice core drilling started in December 2003, using a state-of-the-art deep-ice core drill developed in Japan. Average coring length was 3.7m per run and the ice core drilling speed was 178m per week down to 3,000m deep. Below 3,000m, it became difficult to drill due to warm ice near the bedrock (Figure 2). Around 3,030m, a small fragment of rock was collected in ice.


The rock fragment appears to have originated from the bedrock. Water in the basal ice (or subglacial water) seeped into the borehole and refroze. The refrozen water was also collected (Figure 3). The ice core was transported to Japan and many kinds of analyses begun at various ice core laboratories.



The oxygen isotope profile of the Dome Fuji ice core suggests that the deepest section of ice goes back to 720,000 years ago, which corresponds to MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 17. This age is younger than expected, and we attribute this to discontinuous melting of the basal ice sheet near bedrock. Analysis carried out so far confirms that the Dome Fuji ice core provides a reliable environmental and climatic record back to at least 720,000 years ago.

2. Airborne Atmospheric Observations in the Antarctic under International Cooperation

2.1. General
As a lead-in project to the IPY, the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) of Japan, together with the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) of Germany, conducted airborne atmospheric observations in the Antarctic under ANTSYO-II (Antarctic flight mission at Syowa region: Airborne Geophysical, Glaciological and Atmospheric Research in East Antarctica)/ AGAMES (Antarctic Trace Gas and Aerosol Airborne Measurement Study), using the AWI research aircraft POLAR 2 (Dornier 228) in the austral summer of 2006/07.

2.2. Introduction
Direct and indirect radiative effects of aerosol particles and clouds have been identified as key factors contributing to uncertainties in the prediction of the future global climate (IPCC).  In order to improve knowledge of the origin, transport pathways and vertical structure of aerosols, along with the physical and chemical properties of clouds and their impact on climate in polar regions, a combined program of surface-based, airborne and space-borne measurements is essential.  Airborne atmospheric observations were carried out in the austral summer of 2006/07, following the ANTSYO-I program for geophysical and glaciological research in 2005/06 (IP-101/ ATCM XXIX).
Three joint Japanese (NIPR) - German (AWI) airborne campaigns have been already carried out in the Arctic.  The ASTAR (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosols and radiation) 2000 campaign was conducted between March and April 2000 in the vicinity of Svalbard from Longyearbyen airport (78°N, 16°E) using the AWI aircraft POLAR 4, along with simultaneous ground-based measurements at the international research site Ny-Alesund (79°N, 12°E) in Svalbard.  The 2002 AAMP (Arctic Airborne Measurement Program) was conducted as a trans-Arctic flight in March 2002 with an instrumented jet plane, Gulfstream II (G-II) flown from Nagoya, Japan via Barrow, Alaska, to Longyearbyen, Svalbard across the Arctic Ocean.  The ASTAR 2004 campaign was performed in order to investigate the transition from Arctic spring to summer aerosol conditions using AWI aircraft POLAR 2 and POLAR 4.  Another Arctic airborne campaign, ASTAR 2007 was scheduled for spring 2007 with a focus on the validation of CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) data and as part of the IPY project POLARCAT (POLar study using Aircraft, Remote sensing, surface measurements and modeling of Climate, chemistry, Aerosols and Transport).
Until 2004, Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions (JARE) had operated two single engine aircrafts, a Pillatus PC-6 and a Cessna A 185F from Syowa Station (69°00’ S, 39°35’ E).
The ANTSYO-II/ AGAMES campaign is a precursor to IPY 2007-2008, in association with POLARCAT and POLAR-AOD (a network for the characterization of the means, variability and trends of the climate-forcing properties of aerosols in polar regions).

2.3. Description of the project
The campaign was scheduled for the austral summer season of 2006/07 using the aircraft POLAR 2.  The project was initiated by the AWI in Bremerhaven and the NIPR in Tokyo, together with the Institute of Applied Environmental Research / Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University (Sweden), the Institute for the Physics of Atmosphere of DLR Oberpfaffenhofen (Germany) and the Institute of Atmospheric Science and Climate (CNR-ISAC) Bolognia (Italy).  Aircraft-based measurements were performed as a joint international collaboration in East Antarctica (Camp S17 (40°07’ S, 69°01’ E, 608 m a. s. l.), near Syowa Station) and in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica (Neumayer (70°39’ S, 8°15’ E) and Kohnen (75°00’ S, 0°00’ E, 2890 m a. s. l.) Stations; Figure 4).  During the intensive airborne campaigns, coordinated ground-based activities were executed at Syowa, Neumayer and Kohnen Stations, and additionally at several Antarctic coastal and inland stations, including Aboa (73° S, 13°W), Dome Concordia (75°S, 123°E, 3233 m a. s. l.), Halley (75°S, 26°W), Mario Zucchelli (75 °, 164°E), South Pole (90°S, 2841 m a. s. l.) and Troll (72°S, 2°E, 1298 m a. s. l.).  


Many scientific instruments were on board the aircraft (Figure 5).  Measurements of aerosol number density for particles >0.01 m, aerosol size distribution between 0.01 and 2.2 m in a dry state and size-segregated particle volatility properties for sizes between 0.02 and 0.2 m were carried out by Stockholm University.  The group from DLR carried out measurements of accumulation mode aerosol size distribution in an ambient or near-ambient state using several wing mounted spectrometer probes, as well as size distribution of newly formed ultra-fine particles using a Condensation Particle Size Analyzer (CPSA).  The Japanese group carried out in-situ measurements of size distributions of particle number concentrations (0.08 – 5.0 m) using two optical particle counters and scattering coefficients by integrating nephelometer.  Sampling of aerosols by filter sampler and impactor for single particle element analysis was also conducted.  A frost-point hygrometer (CR-2) was installed.  To get information of layer optical depth, an airborne photometer (CNR/ AWI) was installed.  To extend the vertical profile of observations for greenhouse gases over Syowa Station, as well as to obtain information about air-sea exchange of CO2 as a useful tracer for investigations of aerosol transport and exchange processes, we carried out additional in-situ airborne sampling of air for the analyses of CO2, CH4, SF6, O2, N2O and isotope (13CO2 and 13CH4) concentrations.  Other instruments for flight information (position, atmospheric condition and video image) and radiation were also installed.


2.4. Operation
During the campaign flight period between December 20th, 2006 and January 29th, 2007, a total of 100 flight hours of over 37 flights were performed, including ferry flights and 75 hours of survey flights.  The whole science crew (except for two personnel at S17 from Syowa via Shirase) arrived at Neumayer Station by DROMLAN (Dronning Maud Land Air Network) on December 8th 2006.  16 flights around Neumayer Station, including those over inland Kohnen Station, were conducted prior to the transfer to S17 on January 5th, and 15 flights were conducted around Syowa Station (Figure 6).  Flights were composed of vertical profiles over stations, along with long-range inland (up to 300 km) and over sea-ice flights.  Another aircraft, the Basler DC-3 of DROMLAN was on standby at S17 for SAR (Search and Rescue) purposes for some period; however, during the absence of this plane, the Polar 2 flight area was limited within 100 miles from Syowa Station due to the range of Sikorsky S-61A helicopters on the R/V Shirase for SAR.
