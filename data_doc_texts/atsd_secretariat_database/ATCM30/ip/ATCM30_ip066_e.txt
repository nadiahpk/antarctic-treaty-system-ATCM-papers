Activities of Russia in Antarctica at the first stage of the International Polar Year (2007-2008)

The program of the International Polar Year (2007-2008) officially started on the first of March 2007. This date coincided with the period of completing seasonal operations under the Program of the 52nd Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE), which began in November 2006. So the Antarctic projects have become the first programs by implementation of this significant international scientific event at the beginning of the 21st century. Actions undertaken by Russia are fully in compliance with the principles of the Edinburgh Antarctic Declaration on the International Polar Year 2007-2008 of 19 June 2006.
The scientific program of participation of the Russian Federation in holding the International Polar Year (2006-2007), published in 2006, consisted of the following main directions: 
    • Hydrometeorological and helio-geophysical conditions of polar regions
    • Climate and paleo-climate
    • Upper atmosphere and near-space
    • Free and surface atmosphere
    • Marine environment of polar oceans and seas, sea ice
    • Surface land waters and river mouths in polar areas: ice conditions and floods
    • Soil, cryosphere of land of polar regions, glaciation and permafrost
    • Structure and history of the geological development of the lithosphere of polar regions
    • Terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the Arctic an the Antarctic
    • Assessment and prediction of environmental pollution of polar regions and its influence on their ecosystems
    • State of the populations and their response to climatic and anthropogenic changes in the ecosystems of polar regions
    • Development of the observation systems in polar regions
    • Information systems. Data management
    • Life quality of the population and social-economic development of polar regions
    • Increasing the educational and scientific potential in the area of polar studies, dissemination of knowledge among wide public
The plan for implementing the scientific program of participation of the Russian Federation in holding the International Polar Year (2007-2008) included marine, terrestrial and social studies in the Arctic and the Antarctic. A total of 27 marine research projects in the Arctic and 5 in the Antarctic and 1 bi-polar project were planned for a two-year period. This plan divided the terrestrial studies between the Arctic and the Antarctic regions in the proportion 54 to 13, besides they were supplemented by 10 bi-polar projects. Twenty one social projects are naturally planned only for the Arctic where indigenous population lives, and active economic activity is carried out.
The Program of scientific observations and activities of the 52nd RAE (2006-2008) included 9 expedition projects for conducting full-scale experiments and collection of necessary information foreseen by the aforementioned Implementation Plan. They are as follows:
    • Investigation of the multiyear variability of the vertical profile of the glacial dome exit in the Mirny station area. The Program is carried out using the optical and GPS geodetic measurement equipment at the route Mirny – 100 km of the sledge-caterpillar traverse Mirny-Vostok. Measurements were performed in order to repeat the ice sheet profile obtained by East Germany specialists in the Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE) in 1964-1965 for determining the 40-year variability of the volume and mass of the ice dome of East Antarctica taking into account present-day climatic changes. For the purpose of obtaining the comparative characteristics, the methodology of measurements in 2006-2007 will be adequate to the methods of 1964-1965. The measurements will be made at the similar route points as in 1964-1965 and the work will be carried out jointly by Russian and German specialists.
    • Studies of the regime of snow-firn strata of the sub-Antarctic glacial domes. The program is being implemented in the framework of the Project “Polar glaciers and ice caps as indicators of climate change”. To achieve this objective, work will be performed in the Bellingshausen station area for determining the current alimentation boundary height and the hydro-thermal regime of sub-surface snow-firn strata of sub-Antarctic glacial domes (glacial dome of King-George Island, the South Shetland Islands). Simultaneously, measurements of the seasonal melting field will be carried out up to the upper permafrost boundary on the Fildes Peninsula. This work will allow determining the quantitative values of the change in the alimentation boundary height of sub-Antarctic glacial domes and changes in the state of frozen rocks of the Antarctic Peninsula for the last decades.
    • Water sampling from the surface layer of the subglacial Lake Vostok. The work was performed using the technology developed in 2001 by specialists of the St. Petersburg Mining Institute and the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute. It was planned to conduct drilling operations during the season of 2006-07 with ice core retrieval at the depth range of 3650-3725 m in a deep borehole 5G-1 at Vostok station. The state of the ice core structure was controlled in parallel with the drilling operations for preventing the unplanned contact of the drilling fluid and the water column of the subglacial lake. After extracting the ice core, its structural description and sampling for gas content and electrical conductivity were performed.
    • Measurements of tidal vertical motions of the ice sheet in the northern area of the subglacial Lake Vostok. The work was undertaken with the purpose of investigating the physics of influence of tidal-forming forces of the Moon and the Sun on the water column of the subglacial lake by means of the methodology tested in the Vostok station area during the season of 2000-2001. Measurements were carried out using high-precision GPS receivers deployed on the snow-firn strata. The deployment places were marked by stakes aiming at a possible repeating of the experiment during the season of 2007-2008 and determining the surface ice flow rate. The studies were made jointly by Russian and German specialists.
    • Measurement of frozen soil parameter at the test site near Bellingshausen station. Geocryological studies (measurement of frozen rock parameters) at the test site near Bellingshausen station will allow us to assess the permafrost reaction to local climate warming and join the international system of active layer monitoring in the Antarctic. The aim of the work is to investigate parameters of frozen rocks, vegetation cover, and elemental composition of ornithogenous soils of King George Island under the conditions of significant regional warming. It is planned to perform a geocryological survey of the seasonal melting depth of the upper soil layer at a stationary site 1х1 km in size. The survey is comprised of 10 sections spaced at 100 m. The geocrological surveys will be supplemented by route meteorological measurements (gradient measurements of air temperature in the surface layer, temperature measurements of the underlying surface (with registration of the type of micro-relief) and temperature profile in soil)
    • Influence of climate changes on the marine coastal ecosystems. The Program is being implemented in the framework of the IPY International Project “Impact of melting of glaciers due to climate change on the marine coastal communities in the area of the Antarctic Peninsula”, which unites efforts of scientists from 18 countries. The observed climate warming in the area of the Antarctic Peninsula is accompanied with changes in the ecological systems. Zooplankton is the most mobile and sensitive group of organisms to external impacts. The main aim of the Project is to collect data on the vertical and horizontal (along the gradient of land influence) distribution of zooplankton in coastal waters for investigating the temporal variability and the qualitative composition of plankton communities. Observations of the change of species composition of zooplankton in coastal water of King George Island will allow assessing the local change in marine biota under the warming conditions and organizing for the first time a system of long-period monitoring of marine ecosystems. In parallel with hydro-biological sampling, measurements of oceanographic temperature and salinity parameters will be made in the 0, 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50 m horizons.
    • Oceanographic studies of the Southern Ocean. Oceanographic studies will be made from onboard the R/V “Akademik Fedorov”. It is envisaged to make a series of meridional oceanographic transects for investigating water thermohaline structure in the Southern Ocean, and the vertical distribution of frontal boundaries. It is planned to conduct XBT-sounding with a high spatial resolution at transect between South Africa and Novolzarevskaya station along zero meridian. This transect will be made using CTD-sounding in the area of the continental slope of the Lazarev Sea and up to the ice barrier. In the western Commonwealth Sea, an oceanographic survey will be conducted at the continental slope at several transects perpendicular to the slope by means of CTD-sounding. Activities in the Commonwealth Sea aim at investigating the slope front dynamics and characteristics of the local formation of bottom water. They will contribute to the cluster project 2007/2008 No.8 (“Interaction of the Antarctic slope and shelf waters”). As a result, an estimate of climate-forming factors of the Southern Ocean will be obtained and the mechanisms forming the thermohaline water structure in this region will be determined. The field work results will be used for verifying the regional and global models of ocean circulation and of climate models.
    • Collection of meteorological measurement data at the active IPY phase for scientific and applied studies. This project will be carried out as the IPY cluster project No.267. Twenty three countries participate in the project with Russia being in charge. The project goal is to generate a complete archive of meteorological Antarctic observation data for scientific and applied studies, as the extremely sparse network of Antarctic stations and comparatively short observation series complicate the analysis and data quality control and interpretation. The project objectives include:
    • Acquisition of a synoptic circumpolar data set on the atmospheric parameters of the Southern Hemisphere
    • Improved understanding of the atmospheric processes of the Southern Hemisphere in the formation of current climate, including relations between the synoptic and large-scale circulation systems
    • Development of the optimal observation system for the South Polar Area
    • Creation of the information basis for estimating future climatic changes
The project implementation will allow a significant improvement in understanding the climate-forming processes in the Antarctic and their influence on global climate. In the framework of this Project, Russia will deploy automatic weather stations during the IPY at Molodezhnaya, Russkaya and Leningradskaya Bases.
    • Complex cryo-biological studies of coastal and pelagic sea ice. This Project presents a Russian part of the IPY cluster project No.92 “Climatic interactions and dynamics of ecosystems of the Southern Ocean”. The studies will address the following objectives:
    • Study of species composition and population structure of the ecosystem of coastal sea ice in Prydz Bay and at the oceanographic transects in the Commonwealth Sea
    • Determination of the hydrochemical composition of sea ice and sub-ice water layer
    • Study of the dynamics of ecological-biological parameters characterizing life activity of coastal and pelagic ecosystems of the Antarctic
During the period of landfast ice existence in the vicinity of Progress station (Prydz Bay coast), continuous measurements of hydrophysical and hydrochemical parameters will be carried out using an automatic hydro-sonde. Sampling of sub-ice plankton and benthos in the summertime will be made by means of divers-investigators.

So in 2007, Russia began implementing five national and four cluster projects under the Program of IPY 2007-2008.
