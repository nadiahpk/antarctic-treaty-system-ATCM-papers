A Korean Public Awareness Program ‘Pole-to-Pole Korea’

Since 2005. the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) has been running an educational experience program, entitled "Pole-to-Pole Korea". Aiming at promoting public awareness on the need for preserving the scientific and aesthetic values of Antarctic and Arctic environments and their associated ecosystem, each year KOPRI invites students, artists, photographers, and science teachers to our polar research stations, and it provides the participants with an opportunity to experience polar environment and ecosystem.
 In 2006, KOPRI had organized 2 expeditions. One was for the teenage school children to visit the Dasan Station in the Arctic and the other to the King Sejong Station in the Antarctic. Six school children from all over the country had a wonderful experience of exploring the Arctic. They had participated in some field trips and camping outdoors, and learned about the susceptibility and scientific values of polar region in the matter of global environmental changes such as, global warming, ozone hole etc. 
The expedition to the Antarctic station was consisted of nine peoples: two well-known writers, one painter, two accomplished photographers, two science school teachers, and two college students. They had stayed at King Sejong Station in King George Island for 3 weeks. During their stay, some participated in field surveys, such as terrestrial plants and birds monitoring, and others performed some artistic works. Fortunately, their activities in Antarctica were aired through KBS, the leading public broadcasting company in Korea. The artistic works performed in Antarctica will be introduced to the public through films and exhibitions in 2007. 
The Pole-to-Pole program has been so successful that it has drawn outstanding public attention domestically. During the IPY, this program will be conducted linked with various IPY events in Korea.
