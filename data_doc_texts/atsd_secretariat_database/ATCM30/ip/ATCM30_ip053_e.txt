Criteria for the selection of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

1.	Summary
Selection criteria have been widely advocated as a tool to assist in the identification of marine protected areas (MPAs) worldwide (e.g. Kelleher, 1999; Roberts et al., 2003; CBD, 2006). The application of selection criteria can assist in evaluating candidate sites, prioritising areas that merit protection, and determining the appropriate design and boundaries for selected areas. While they do not provide definitive answers to questions relating to the location and design of protected areas, criteria can be used alongside other tools to support decision-making. For example, selection criteria might be applied in conjunction with bioregionalisation analysis to support the systematic development of a representative system of MPAs. 

The effective application of selection criteria depends on the definition of clear objectives to be achieved by a system of MPAs. Different criteria may apply to the selection of different types of marine protected areas (e.g. ASPAs, ASMAs, and other area-based measures including those relating to sustainable fisheries management), designed for the achievement of a range of objectives. 

This paper considers how existing selection criteria for protected areas, both in the context of the Antarctic Treaty System and in other international systems, might be applied in the identification of candidate marine sites for special protection and management. 

2.	Introduction
Selection criteria can be defined as guidelines on the conditions that should be met in order for an area to be considered worthy of special or additional protection. Criteria may relate to the values or qualities present within an area, for example they may describe particular environmental, ecological or scientific characteristics. However, selection criteria may also relate to practical considerations such as feasibility of implementation.  

Criteria provide an objective method of protected area selection, whereby areas can be evaluated on the basis of a pre-agreed set of conditions. However, some degree of subjective judgement and flexibility is still required in defining the criteria, as well as in decisions on whether the criteria have been met. 

This paper does not aim to repeat previous work on the definition of selection criteria. Instead, it aims to provide an overview of the existing criteria systems, both in the context of the Antarctic Treaty System and in other international systems, and to suggest ways in which selection criteria might be applied in the identification of candidate sites for designation as marine protected areas.

This topic has particular relevance in the context of current work on MPAs being undertaken within CCAMLR and the CEP (particularly the CCAMLR Workshop on Bioregionalisation of the Southern Ocean, to be held in Brussels, August 2007). At the 2006 meeting of the CCAMLR Scientific Committee (SC-CAMLR-XXV), it was noted that work on methods for the selection and designation of MPAs should proceed in parallel to the work on bioregionalisation. The CEP also noted that it was important to develop criteria to support the designation of MPAs (CEP IX Final Report, para. 95). 

3.	Existing selection criteria
Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection outlines objectives and selection criteria for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) (both marine and terrestrial) in the form of a list of values to be protected, and a description of the types of areas that should be included in the series of ASPAs.

Article 3.1 of Annex V states that areas may be designated as an ASPA to:
“…protect outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values, or ongoing or planned scientific research.”

Article 3.2 of Annex V states that the series of ASPAs should include:
    (a) areas kept inviolate from human interference so that future comparisons may be possible with localities that have been affected by human activities;
    (b) representative examples of major terrestrial, including glacial and aquatic, ecosystems and marine ecosystems;
    (c) areas with important or unusual assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native birds or mammals;
    (d) the type locality or only known habitat of any species;
    (e) areas of particular interest to ongoing or planned scientific research;
    (f) examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features;
    (g) areas of outstanding aesthetic and wilderness value;
    (h) sites or monuments of recognised historic value, and 
    (i) such other areas as may be appropriate to protect the values set out in paragraph 1 above.

Further criteria to assist with the identification of ASPAs are elaborated in the Guidelines for Implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Protocol (available in the CEP Handbook). These include quality criteria to evaluate whether special protection is required, as well as a checklist for assessing environmental risk, and feasibility criteria to assist in defining areas for protection.

Objectives and selection criteria are also defined for marine and terrestrial Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs). Article 4.1 of Annex V states that areas may be designated as an ASMA to:
“…assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, improve cooperation between Parties or minimise environmental impacts.”

Article 4.2 states that ASMAs may include:
    (a) areas where activities pose risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts; and
    (b) sites or monuments of recognised historic value.

In 2005, the CCAMLR Workshop on Marine Protected Areas noted that conservation objectives for MPAs include the protection and maintenance of ecosystem processes, habitats, biodiversity and species (ATCM XXIX WP 7). The workshop also identified types of areas that may require protection as MPAs:
    • Representative areas
    • Scientific areas to assist with distinguishing between the effects of harvesting and other activities from natural ecosystem changes, as well as providing opportunities for understanding the Antarctic marine ecosystem without interference
    • Areas potentially vulnerable to impacts by human activities, to mitigate those impacts and/or ensure the sustainability of the rational use of marine living resources
    • Locations where important ecosystem processes are amenable to spatial protection.

Selection criteria have also been defined to assist in the development of MPAs elsewhere. Key examples of well-established criteria systems are those developed by the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) (Kelleher, 1999), and the OSPAR Convention on the Protection and Conservation of Ecosystems and Biological Diversity of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR, 2003). An Experts Workshop held in Canada in 2005 provided advice to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on scientific criteria that are appropriate for prioritizing areas according to their biological and ecological significance (Dearden and Topelko, 2005; CBD, 2006).

Many of the existing criteria systems in use elsewhere have similar characteristics, and the recent Experts Workshop on criteria systems (CBD, 2006) has identified a core set of common criteria to identify ecologically and biologically significant areas. Table 1 summarises a range of different criteria systems currently existing for Antarctica and elsewhere, highlighting the similarities between them. Some of the criteria have been simplified in order to allow comparison, since analogous terms have been used in different systems to describe similar types of areas (for example, the criterion “degree of interference/naturalness” listed in Table 1 corresponds to the area type listed in Annex V as “kept inviolate from human interference”). Each criterion may also be elaborated to provide a range of more specific questions (see Guidelines for Implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas).

4.	Application of selection criteria for Antarctic MPAs
The effective application of selection criteria depends on the definition of clear objectives to be achieved by a system of MPAs. It is important to note that individual criteria may have particular relevance to specific types of protected areas and/or objectives for protection and management. Different criteria may apply to the selection of e.g. ASPAs, ASMAs, and other area-based measures (including those relating to sustainable fisheries management), designed for the achievement of a range of objectives. The same selection criteria may not apply to all types of marine protected area. Flexibility must therefore be maintained in the selection process, so that criteria can be applied according to the objectives of particular area types. 

Table 2 presents information linking the selection criteria listed in Table 1 with the different types and objectives of Antarctic marine protected areas.

Table 2 demonstrates that certain selection criteria may apply to more than one type of protected/managed area. For example, vulnerability has relevance to ASMAs (i.e. areas that may be vulnerable to mutual interference or cumulative impacts), and may also be relevant to the objectives of CCAMLR (for example, vulnerability of predator species to the effects of fishing activities targeting their prey species). 

Criteria can be applied to assist in identifying and prioritising areas for the achievement of specific objectives, and in choosing the appropriate category for designation. Areas would be selected as candidates for special protection if they were judged to meet one (or more) of the criteria outlined above. Depending on the objectives for the site, one or more criteria may be considered to have greater ‘weight’ in the consideration process. Criteria might also be elaborated to set particular conditions to be met, for example a percentage of the total breeding population of interest, a proportion of total habitat type, or the level of decline of a particular species. Different criteria can be considered as layers in the decision making process, and used at any stage in the process as appropriate.

Experience from the use of selection criteria in other systems (e.g. the OSPAR processes for the NE Atlantic) suggests that criteria systems should be kept simple, and that while they are a useful component of the selection process, they should not be relied upon as the only potential tool for identification of candidate areas. There may be cases where the application of selection criteria is not necessary or appropriate. Nevertheless, criteria are useful in maintaining transparency in the selection process, and clarifying how decisions have been made.

Application of selection criteria in conjunction with bioregionalisation outcomes
Selection criteria alone do not provide definitive answers to questions relating to the location and design of protected areas, however they can be used alongside other tools to support decision-making. Criteria may be particularly useful when employed in conjunction with other tools such as bioregionalisation outcomes. For example, criteria might be used to select candidate areas within a series of defined bioregions, to support the development of a representative system of MPAs. Thus, bioregions can be used as ‘areas of search’ in which candidate areas are identified using selection criteira as part of a ‘bottom-up’ approach. Alternatively, a ‘top-down’ approach might be taken whereby a range of existing candidate areas are prioritised according to whether they meet particular criteria, or fit within the biogeographic framework. 

Risk assessment and analysis of vulnerability
An assessment of the risk to a particular area is an important component of the selection process. Vulnerability may be used as a criterion for the initial identification of candidate sites (see Table 1), however it may also be applied at a later stage in the selection process to identify specific existing and/or potential threats and to prioritise the selection of sites for protection. 

The Guidelines for Implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas list the following categories for assessing environmental risk to a potential protected area:
    • Human activities and impacts
    • Natural processes
    • Natural variability and viability
    • Non-Antarctic threats
    • Urgency
    • Scientific uncertainty

Feasibility criteria
A further stage in the selection process may be the application of criteria relating to feasibility or practical considerations. The Guidelines for Implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas define a series of feasibility criteria relating to:
    • Boundaries
    • Existing scientific or other uses
    • Size
    • Appropriate management tools
    • Time period/duration
    • Accessibility/logistics
    • Ability to protect more than one value and meet different objectives

OSPAR (2003) lists a similar series of practical criteria, which also relate to environmental risk considerations:
    • Size 
    • Potential for restoration
    • Degree of acceptance 
    • Potential for success of management measures 
    • Potential for damage to the area by human activities 
    • Scientific value 

An assessment of feasibility helps to define the potential for protection and management objectives to be achieved by a particular area, and to design appropriate provisions for implementation.

Additional selection methods
The application of selection criteria may be assisted by the use of decision-support software and geographic information systems (GIS) to map relevant values, features and potential threats. Decision-support software tools can be used to process spatial information on species, habitats and other relevant features, providing suggestions on spatial planning for protected areas to meet a range of criteria. MARXAN is one of the most commonly used software tools of this type, and has been employed in MPA design in many other parts of the world (Ball & Possingham, 2000). The user is able to define objectives and criteria such as representation of a set amount of a particular habitat type. Feasibility criteria can also be incorporated into this type of analysis, by setting parameters such as minimum area size or distance to existing protected areas. 

5.	Conclusion
Marine protected areas can be selected to achieve clearly defined objectives using a combination of tools including selection criteria, bioregionalisation outcomes, risk assessment, feasibility analysis and decision-support software. No single tool will provide a definitive solution, and parallel selection processes may be required to achieve multiple objectives. For example, bioregionalisation analysis to identify representative areas might proceed in parallel with risk assessment to consider vulnerable areas.

In applying selection criteria, there must be a balance between maintaining objectivity and transparency in the process, and maintaining flexibility and simplicity. A flexible approach will allow for a range of selecetion tools to be employed according to specific protection objectives. 

The existing selection criteria described in this paper are adequate for the selection of Antarctic MPAs across a range of protection and management area categories. Further consideration should be given to incorporating these criteria into existing and future work such as bioregionalisation analysis and assessment of risk, where appropriate.

The application of selection criteria in a flexible manner, and in combination with other tools, may assist in achieving the goals of both the CEP and CCAMLR with regard to the development of a harmonised regime for the protection of the marine environment across the Antarctic Treaty System.
