Historical Sites of Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica
















Historical Sites of Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica


INTRODUCTION

The working paper is an inventory of archaeological sites on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, and the South Shetland Islands.  The sites are located in two main areas --the upper right and central areas-- of the Peninsula.  The inventory was carried out by the archaeologist Rubén Stehberg during a recent expedition by Chile to Byers Peninsula and Rugged Island.

Byers Peninsula (62º37´S 61º03´W) is ASPA No. 126, which corresponds to the Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 126 and is administered by the United Kingdom and Chile.  

These archaeological sites were first discovered by Lewis Smith and Simpson, who conducted a pioneer reconnaissance of the sites, clearly of extraordinary importance in the historical context of the first and second sealing periods (Lewis Smith R.I. & H.W. Simpson. “Early nineteen century sealer’s refuges on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands”. British Antarctic Survey. Bull.74: 49-72.) The most recent bibliography on the subject, which expands scientific understanding of the sites, pertains primarily to Argentine researchers and is included at the end of the document.

The cartography in which the sites are identified and the new toponyms incorporated, the latter being derived from archaeological discoveries that provide background on the history of the sealing period in Antarctica, is being prepared by the Military Geographic Institute of Chile. 

Once the exact coordinates are validated, Chile and the United Kingdom can together consider the incorporation of the archaeological sites described in this document as an Annex to the Management Plan of ASPA No. 129. 

This is highly recommended because of the intrinsic value of the archaeological sites and their historical significance.  As well, their identification in the corresponding permits and in the management of ASPA No. 126 is recommended.

Archaeological sites of Byers Peninsula

Lima Lima Cave

S 62º 36´930”
W 61º 02¨207”




The cave is 3.5 m high, 22 m deep, and 6 m wide. In the back of the cave there are two walls forming an entrance to an enclosed area of 4.2 x 2.1m. This site was excavated in 1995-6. While the stone walls are well preserved to date, between 1995 and 2007 a gradual collapse of the cave walls and ceiling has occurred.  










Lair Point 1

S 62º 36´910”
W 61º 02¨099”





Structure consisting of one stone hut and one annex built against a rock stack. This structure is badly preserved due to the action of fauna, water and wind erosion. No changes have been observed since 1995. 


Lair Point 2

S 62º 37´178”
W 61º 02¨013”

This site consists of the material remains of a British expedition of geologists and naturalists during the 1950s.  Wooden skis were found.












Robbery Beach 1 

S 62º 37´320”
W 61º 01¨948”




Structure facing the beach consisting of two stone walls enclosing an area between two rock stacks. There are 2 whale vertebra in the interior. No changes have been observed since 1995.

Cutler 1

S 62º 37¨635”
W 60º 59¨993”





The structure consists of a hut site with three stone walls against a rock stack. There is high density of artefacts on the surface (fragments of metal, glass, stoneware, among others). This site is thought to have been excavated by British naturalists in the 1950s. The stone walls are well preserved despite high impact of the local fauna on the site. No changes have been observed since 1995. 

Cutler 2




Structure consisting of three stone walls against a rock stack. This site was identified in 1995 but not found until 2007. This might have been caused by the effect of erosion and rock falls from the stack.


















Black Hill

S 62º 39¨718”
W 61º 00¨197”







The site consists of four stone walled structures of different dimensions against a single rock stack. This site was excavated in 1999. It was occupied at two different times during the 19th century. Two huts are relatively well preserved, while the remaining two are affected by the action of elephant seals and fur seals.

South Beach 1

S 62º 39´667”
W 60º 58¨576”






The site consists of a stone wall closing a natural area formed by a rock outcrop, and an annex. This site was excavated between 1995 and 1997. The main hut was the living area of 19th century sealers, where many artefacts were found. A hearth was found in the annex related to the processing of elephant seal oil. The site is well preserved but the expansion of a nearby lagoon is a concern as it has already covered part of the annex and it is extending to the main hut.


Stackpole 1

S 62º 39´907”
W 60º 57¨171”





The structure consists of a low line of stones. It has limited visibility since the structure does not rise above the ground. The purpose of this structure is unclear due to its poor preservation.














Stackpole 2

S 62º 36´931”
W 60º 56¨528”




The shape of this structure suggests that it could be a grave. It consists of an association of stones and whale bones. Since 1995 some changes have been observed due to the action of people: two whale vertebra have been moved and appear as if they have been used as seats.

X 1 Point 

S 62º 36´930”
W 61º 02¨207”





The structure consists of three stone walls against a rock stack close to the sea and a lagoon. High impact of different agents has affected the preservation of the site. The whale bone used as roofing support seen in 1995 inside the hut are now almost buried 7m away.



X 2 Point

S 62º 40´216”
W 60º 55¨459”





Stone walled hut site against a big sea stack contains a whale jaw bone suggesting a roof support. The site is poorly preserved due to the action of elephant seals. One of the stone walls is partially collapsed, and the other one is 1.5m tall and is well preserved. 



X 3 Point

S 62º 40´273”
W 60º 55¨426”




Stone walled hut site against a rock stack. The preservation of this structure is compromised due to the action of elephant seals eroding the surface and stratigraphy of this site. Some changes have been observed since 1995: several artifacts including a paddle are now visible on the surface.




Vietor 1

S 62º 40´494”
W 61º 05¨700”




The structure consists of three walls against a rock stack enclosing an area of 2.10 x 1.80m. It contains several whale vertebra “seats” and a whale rib used for roofing. From 1995 to 2007 some changes have been observed. Five circular holes were found on the rock face immediately behind the hut, indicating the extraction of geological samples (probably geomagnetism). The rear wall of the hut appears to have been pulled down to form a level surface for the geological drilling.
















Vietor 2

S 62º 40´496”
W 61º 05¨805”




The site consists of a large stone structure of 5.40 x 2.40m among rock stacks with an annex of 2.10 x 1.5m. From 1995 to 2007 some changes have been observed:  Some whale vertebra placed inside the inner area of the hut have been moved. 


Vietor 3

 S 62º 40´488”
W 61º 06¨043”

This structure consists of a 2.5 m long double line of stones. It has limited visibility since the structure does not rise above the ground. A whale skull bone is placed at the end and continuing one of the line of stones.
















Sealer´s Hill 1

S 62º 36´930”
W 61º 02¨207”




Structure consisting of a stone-walled hut and an annex against a rock stack. The preservation of this structure is compromised due to the action of elephant seals, which often occupy the main hut, thus eroding the surface and stratigraphy of this site. From 1995 to 2007 some changes have been observed: a whale vertebra is now visible on the surface, and the entrance walls of the main hut have collapsed.

Sealer´s Hill 2

S 62º 40´357”
W 61º 06¨868”





A structure made up of a series of curved walls of stone forming a roughly circular space. No changes have been observed from 1995. 

Sealer´s Hill 3

S 62º 40´369”
W 61º 06¨218”




Structure consisting of a stone-walled hut and an annex containing a whale jaw bone. No apparent changes since 1995 have been observed, except the displacement of three whale vertebra from the main hut that have been found at 10m and 20m from the site.


Sealer´s Hill 4 

S 62º 40´341”
W 61º 06¨286”




Structure consisting of two stone-walled enclosures against a low rock outcrop. There are whale vertebra near the site. No changes have been observed since 1995.


Sealer Cave
S 62º 40´452”
W 61º 06¨868”

Smith and Simpson reported in the 1950s a stone wall across the rear of the cave, with timbers and seal bones on the floor. None of these elements nor the structure can now be found inside the cave.


Long Rocks

S 62º 40´434”
W 61º 08¨540”

An area of 1.20 x 3m in between two rock stacks. There is a high density of artifacts (leather shoes, fragments of wood, glass). The presence of some timbers suggests that this area might have been enclosed by a structure in the past.




Devil Point 1

S 62º 40´311”
W 61º 10¨700”


Stone wall hut contains whale jaw bone suggesting roof support. Fragments of stoneware, glass and metal artefacts are spread inside and around the site. Intensive erosion has occurred due to the action of elephant seals crossing over the site. 



Devil Point 2

S 62º 39´818”
W 61º 09¨545”



Reported in the 1950s as the base of wooden hut on a sealer’s cargo sledge. In 2007 only the remains of a sledge were located and excavated, with no other evidence of occupation.  The site is located at the edge of a penguin rookery on the slope of a hill. Melt water crosses over the site causing erosion.

Varadero Point 

S 62º 36´496”
W 61º 04¨864”



The structure consists of three stone walls against a rock stack enclosing an area of 2.40 x 2.10m. The hut contains 4 whale ribs suggesting roof supports. The annex contains 1 whale.

Pencas 1

S 62º 36´435”
W 61º 06¨089”



The structure consists of a 4-walled stone structure containing three whale vertebra seats. It is placed 15m away from an elephant seal colony. The stone walls are completely collapsed.

Pencas 2

S 62º 36´414”
W 61º 06¨242”



The site consists of a small rock shelter formed between two large sloping rocks. The presence of stones in the entrance suggests that a stone wall might have existed. 



Pencas 3

S 62º 36´177”
W 61º 06¨339”




Isolated hut placed on a small peninsula far from a rock stack: Straight stone walls enclose a roughly square space. It contains whale vertebra “seats”. This site is poorly preserved.

Problems with conservation and some criteria for solutions
 
During an archaeological reconnaissance visit conducted in January 2007, some of the factors causing damage to the sites were identified.  These can be grouped as follows:

Natural factors:

-	entry of marine mammals and birds   
-	problems with ice and wind
-	problems with ice melt and  sea entry
-	rockfalls     

Anthropogenic factors:

-	entry of scientists that ignore the value of the site 
-	unfinished archaeological work    


Some of these problems can be avoided or lessened if some measures are adopted, such as the construction of fences.  A low and solid wooden structure surrounding the site would keep marine mammals from entering.  Further, the site would be made known to scientists that ignore its existence and that conduct harmful activities in its interior (e.g., geologists that take rock samples from the walls of the enclosures).  As well, this would inhibit rockfalls in the interior.
