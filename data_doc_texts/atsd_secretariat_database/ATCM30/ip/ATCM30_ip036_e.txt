Non-native species: Pathways and Vectors between New Zealand and Scott Base, Antarctica




Non-native species: Pathways and Vectors between New Zealand and Scott Base, Antarctica.
Introduction
In April 2006, New Zealand hosted the ‘Non-native Species in the Antarctic’ workshop, the outcomes of which were reported to CEP IX (ATCM XXIX / WP 13).  As a follow-up to the workshop, the New Zealand Antarctic programme (Antarctica New Zealand) was keen to assess the key risk areas of its operations through which non-native species might be transported to Antarctica.
As a medium-sized national programme, New Zealand has relatively easy aircraft access to Antarctica, with a high turnover of personnel each season (around 400 people travel to Antarctica through the New Zealand programme each season).  In order to assess the key risk areas of the programme Antarctica New Zealand supported a M.Sc. research project on pathways and vectors by which non-native species could travel from New Zealand to Antarctica (Fortune, 2006).  Current practices with regard to transporting personnel, shipping containers, and fresh produce were examined and recommendations to alleviate detected risks were made. 
This information paper outlines the key conclusions and recommendations from that research.  It is suggested that this simple assessment of key risks is a useful starting point for addressing non-native species concerns.
Methods
Four sampling protocols were followed to gather data for the study:
    • Seed traps were placed around the cargo handling yard at Antarctica New Zealand’s premises to assess the material that containers and other cargo may collect whilst being stored prior to shipping in January;
    • New and used (but cleaned) clothing was inspected for seeds and organic material;
    • Shipping containers were inspected and sampled for seeds and other material;
    • Supplies of fresh food (which are flown to Scott Base throughout the summer season) were inspected.
Key findings
An average of 21 seeds was found per shipping container, and a range of plant species were cultivated from those seeds that landed in the seed trays and traps.  When the containers were searched, a significant volume of soil, stones and plant material were removed from the containers with one container harbouring over 1kg of material.
Inspections of Antarctica New Zealand’s clothing showed that for each item of clothing issued, there was a 2.7% chance that the item contained a seed.  Given that a standard clothing issue consists of 17 items of clothing, this gives a 46% chance of there being a seed in a standard kit.  Grass and leaves were also observed on clothing bags, particularly in the open weave straps.
Inspections of fresh fruit and vegetables bound for Antarctica revealed soil around the bases of cauliflower, mushrooms, silver beet and spinach, and insects were observed within some cabbages.
The results of this study suggest that non-native species regularly have the potential to enter Antarctica via several vectors and pathways, but that there are a range of simple measures which would substantially reduce this risk.
Recommendations
Current operational procedures are inadequate in terms of minimising the risk of non-native species being introduced to Antarctica. Adopting the following recommendations could significantly reduce the risk: 
    • Containers with the gutter-free roof design retain less material - any replacements due to damage or old age should continue to be of this type.
    • Containers that are being sent by ship need to be sprayed or washed externally and internally, or at the least need to be swept out before packing and transportation. An improved container tracking system including information on where containers have been and for how long is advised.
    • More thorough cleaning and inspection of clothing is required. Polar fleece garments require more than a simple machine wash. They may need to be visually checked and have any seeds removed by hand. 
    • The soles of boots need to have a more thorough washing to ensure that all dirt is removed, therefore reducing the risk of contamination. 
    • The canvas bags should be phased out and a rubberised material used instead. The handles of all bags need to be modified in order to minimise the entanglement of seeds. It is suggested that the handles are made of leather or another non-woven material. 
    • Scientific equipment which has been used outside of Antarctica is another possible vector. It is suggested that more rigorous inspections of the equipment are carried out. 
    • Fresh produce needs more careful preparation before leaving Christchurch. The cleaning of each crate is also advised. 
    • Education is an essential tool for encouraging those involved with Antarctic research to be more vigilant and proactive. The findings of this study should be distributed to Antarctica New Zealand staff to help raise awareness of the risks.
Conclusions
On the basis of the findings of this study, Antarctica New Zealand is currently developing an action plan to reduce or eliminate the identified risks.  The action plan will include the need to seek support from key suppliers, particularly suppliers of fresh produce.  Antarctica New Zealand is also engaging relevant expertise from New Zealand’s non-native species experts (Biosecurity New Zealand) to assist in developing appropriate mitigating measures.
