International Scientific and Logistic Collaboration in Antarctica

Information Paper  submitted by COMNAP under agenda item 14 “Operational Issues”

Introduction
1.  At ATCM XXIX (2006), attention was drawn to the reiteration of CEP's concern about the potential environmental consequences of an excessive concentration of stations in Antarctica. It was noted that these concerns can be addressed, in part, by increased cooperation in Antarctica and that some parties are making efforts to share their facilities and encourage wider participation in their research programmes. Refer ATCM XXIX final report, paragraph 73.
2. International collaboration is widespread and a normal part of National Programs' activities.  To provide a broader perspective of such collaboration,  COMNAP conducted a survey in 2007 to assess the extent of international scientific and logistic collaboration amongst National Antarctic Programs at a time when a number of nations are either building new research stations or replacing old ones. The Survey confirmed a high and increasing level of international collaboration.
The Survey
3.  The Survey asked questions to establish the current and expected level of collaboration on the use of facilities by scientists and logisticians from other nations.   Separate questions were asked about scientific collaboration and mutual logistic support.
Scientific Collaboration
4.  Virtually all National Antarctic Programs are involved in international scientific collaboration. The number of scientists from other nations deployed by a National Antarctic Program ranged from 5% to 40% of the total number of scientists they send to Antarctica.  The overall situation among those National Programs that do operate stations is:
    • 96% of National Antarctic Programs host scientists from other nations (always or sometimes).
    • 60% of National Antarctic Programs expect the number of scientists hosted from other nations to increase.
    • 65% of National Antarctic Programs expect the number of other nations from which they host scientists to increase.

Logistic Collaboration
5.  The logistic questions focused on partnerships, the sharing of logistic facilities (including land-base facilities, ships and aircraft) and support to people, ships or aircraft in transit: 
    • 43% of National Antarctic Programs expect the number of ‘logistic partnerships’ to increase (definitely or possibly).
    • 35% of National Antarctic Programs operate or manage logistic facilities in ‘partnership’ with other nations. This can for example include joint operation of a station or joint management of support facilities for their stations. 
    • 78% of National Antarctic Programs provide logistic facilities for other nations (always or sometimes) and 62% expect these arrangements to increase.
    • 73% of National Antarctic Programs provide transit facilities for other nations, and 50% expect these arrangements to increase.
    • 96% of National Antarctic Programs share ships or aircraft with other nations (always or sometimes), and 57% expect these arrangements to increase.

Conclusion
6.  The high and increasing level of scientific and logistic collaboration amongst National Antarctic Programs is in the finest spirit of the Antarctic Treaty.   This excellent situation has been facilitated by COMNAP through the exchange of practical, operational information to help improve the way all National Antarctic Programs can fulfil their various missions, together or independently. That includes mutual support in the design, ongoing improvement and operation of Antarctic facilities and transport infrastructure. 
7.  The ATCM is invited to note:
    • The positive way in which National Antarctic Programs work together and share facilities for scientific research.
    • That over 50% of National Antarctic Programs expects the levels of collaboration and sharing of facilities to increase.
