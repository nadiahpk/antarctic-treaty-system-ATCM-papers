Annual Report of New Zealand pursuant to Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty 2007/2008

Information Paper Submitted by New Zealand



1. Notification of measures taken pursuant to Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Environmental Protocol
New Zealand enacted legislation to implement the Protocol in the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994, which came into force on 1 February 1995.  Since that time New Zealand has worked to fully implement the Protocol, including into the activities of the national Antarctic programme managed by the New Zealand Antarctic Institute (Antarctica New Zealand).
 
The Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Regulations 2006 came into force in mid-2006 and are intended to improve the implementation of Measures under Annex V to the Environmental Protocol.  They specify under the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 certain areas designated by the ATCM as ASMAs, ASPAs and Historic Sites and Monuments.  Further regulations specifying all other areas so designated are being developed.  
 
A list of approvals and permits issued under the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 during the 2007/2008 season is attached as Appendix 1.
2. Contingency Plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol 
Antarctica New Zealand has in place the following contingency plans to cover its activities in Antarctica: 
    • Health, Safety and Environment System 
    • Oil Spill Contingency Plan 
    • Disaster Recovery Plan 

Information regarding these plans can be obtained from:

3. Circulation of information pursuant to Annex I, Article 6(1) of the Protocol 
3.1 Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures 
The Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 implements the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  Under the Act, all activities must undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as set out in Part III of the Act (ss17-24). Under section 24 of the Act, it is an offence to carry out an activity without completing this process. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) administers this Act and the Minister of Foreign Affairs makes the final determination as to whether or not an activity should proceed.  EIAs are submitted to the Antarctic Policy Unit of MFAT, which then seeks expert advice on the potential environmental impacts of the proposed activities from Antarctica New Zealand and the Ministry for the Environment.
Antarctica New Zealand coordinates the provision of EIAs for any activities it supports. The preparation of other EIAs is the responsibility of the proponent, although MFAT can provide a model IEE on request, as well as advice and guidance on the type and content of the EIA that is needed. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs gives final approval of the EIA on the basis of MFAT recommendations which take into account the expert advice received.  The Minister also has discretion under the Act to set conditions and make directions regarding the proposed activities in order to protect the environment. Conditions and directions are often imposed to manage issues such as compliance and environmental monitoring and post-activity reporting. Non-compliance with a direction given by the Minister is an offence carrying liability to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding $100,000 (ss 10(2) and (3)).

3.2 List of Initial Environmental Evaluations 
A list of Initial Environmental Evaluations for the 2007/2008 season prepared in accordance with Annex I, Article 2 of the Protocol is included in Appendix 1. 
3.3 Significant information obtained, and any action taken in consequence thereof, from procedures put in place in accordance with Annex I Articles 2(2) and 5 of the Protocol
During the 2007/2008 season, no significant information has been obtained from monitoring procedures put in place in accordance with the provisions of Annex I.
3.4 Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (Annex 1, Article 3(6)) 
No Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations were received for the 2007/2008 season.

4. Report pursuant to Annex II, Article 6 of the Protocol 
4.1 Number and nature of permits issued under Annex II of the Protocol during the 2007/2008 season 
Permits issued under Annex II for the 2007/2008 season are noted in the table in Appendix 2. 

4.2 Records and statistics concerning flora and fauna taken in the 2007/2008 season 
A record is provided in the table in Appendix 3.


5. Report pursuant to Annex III, Article 9 of the Protocol 
Antarctica New Zealand’s overall statement on waste management is: 
“Antarctica New Zealand will minimise, reuse and recycle waste generated by its activities as far as practicable and will ensure that waste is disposed of with minimal environmental impacts.  Waste management planning will examine the use, where appropriate, of alternative technologies, materials and disposal options, and identify areas of past activity which require future clean up and/or remediation.” 
Antarctica New Zealand has a waste management handbook that provides national programme personnel with practical procedures for the day-to-day implementation of waste management, including waste handling, storage and disposal. The handbook is reviewed every year at the close of the summer season and aids planning of Antarctica New Zealand waste management activities. 
The waste management handbook, reports on its implementation, and inventories of past activities can be obtained from:

6. Report pursuant to Annex IV of the Protocol 
6.1 Notice of activities undertaken in case of emergency (Article 7(2)) 
There have been no cases of emergency relating to the safety of a ship and those on board or saving life at sea involving New Zealand flagged vessels in the 2007/2008 season. 
6.2 Implementation of Sovereign Immunity (Art 11(2)) 
New Zealand state owned and operated vessels are subject to the Marine Protection Rules applicable to Antarctica issued under the Maritime Transport Act 1994.  These rules implement both MARPOL 73/78 and Annex IV of the Protocol.


7. Report pursuant to Annex V, Article 10 of the Protocol 
7.1	Number and nature of permits issued under Annex V of the Protocol during the 2007/2008 Season 
Permits issued under Annex V for the 2007/2008 season are noted in the table in Appendix 1. 

7.2 Significant Change or Damage to any ASMA, ASPA or Historic Site or Monument 
ASPA 155: Cape Evans Hut: Snow drift and ice build up continues to threaten the southern wall of Scott’s Terra Nova Hut and contributes to the issue of ice-heave under the building.  An estimated 100 cubic metres of snow and ice was removed from on and around the hut early in the season.  A water proof membrane was installed in the southern and eastern exterior walls to protect the hut from melt water ingress.  The food store on the southern side of the hut “Bowers Annex” was excavated to allow access to undertake this work.  The drainage around the hut was improved to assist melt water flow away from the site.  A “modern” window on the southern wall was replaced with the conserved original window

7.3	Measures taken to implement the provisions of Annex V 
None this year. 


Appendix 1: Initial Environmental Evaluations
