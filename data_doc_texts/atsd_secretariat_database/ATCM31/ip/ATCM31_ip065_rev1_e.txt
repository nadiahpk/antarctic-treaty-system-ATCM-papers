The Results of the Polar Research Workshop
The European Polar Research  Icebreaker Aurora Borealis – FP7 Project
The 2nd International Symposium of Polar Scientific Research
IPY 2007-2008

Organized by
Romanian Polar Research Institute, European Science Foundation and 
the German Institute for Polar and Marine Research „Alfred Wegener” 
Romanian Academy, Bucharest, 16-17 November 2007

The 2nd International Symposium & Workshop of Polar Scientific Research has been organized in Bucharest, Romanian Academy, as an important activity in the Excellence Research Projects (CEEX), Module III, in which Romanian Polar Research Institute (RPRI) is a coordinator or a partner, Phase 3/2007 – Turning to good account of the existing research competences, Activity III.1- Organization of a workshop to get advanced knowledge of FP7 project elaboration, the purpose of which was to establish the actual fields of research in cooperation and of some feasable FP7 and international projects.

The application for these projects, within the Excellence Research competition in Romania in 2006, was sustained by European and third country partners, namely: P1. Australian Antarctic Division,  Dr. Michael Stoddart, Chief Scientist, Australia; P2. Montana State University, John C. Priscu, Professor of Ecology, USA; P3. Universiteit of Antwerpen, Dr. Adrian Covaci, Toxicological Center, Belgium; P4. Leopold-Franzens-Universitat Innsbruck, Fakultat fur Biologie, Institut fur Mikrobiologie; Prof. dr. Rosa Margesin and Prof. Dr. Franz Schinner (Head of the Institute), Austria; P5. Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Associated Professor Michael Green and Dr. Sheldon Tarre, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Israel; P6. Institute of Biology, Bulgarian Science Academy, Sofia, Dr. Victoria Gesheva, Bulgaria. 

Researchers of the Romanian, European and international scientific community participated in this meeting, among which partners in RPRI projects, representatives of the European Science Foundation and European Polar Consortium. Representatives of „Alfred Wegener” German Institute for Polar and Marine Research, responsible for Aurora Borealis Icebreaker FP7 Project, in which Romanian Antarctic Foundation is a partner too, and ESF honoured us by their presence and special support. 	

European Science Foundation and „Alfred Wegener” German Institute for Polar and Marine Research suggested us to include in our Symposium program a Workshop for the presentation in Romania, as a partner country in the European Polar Consortium, of Aurora Borealis Icebreaker FP7 Project.
	
Romanian Polar Research Institute involved in organizing and achieving this scientific action, in which 85 specialists in various research fields participated, out of which 14 foreign  researchers from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Russian Federation and European Science Foundation (represented by Dr. Paul Egerton, Director). 

Based on a workshop discussion between scientists from 29 Romanian institutes and universities and from 10 countries, and the AURORA BOREALIS FP7 Project team, the following initial areas of interest have been identified:
	
1. Paleoceanography and paleoclimate research
-  Marine environmental, sedimentological history and evolution
-  Carbon sink in the Arctic and Southern Oceans
2. Sea-ice system
- Growth/accumulation of microalgae in different types of sea ice
- Contribution of microbial communities to re-mineralization of organic matter in the ice
- The role of the sea ecosystem: in matter transport to higher trophic levels
- Ice evolution study
3. Oceanographic research
- Marine environmental, sedimentological structures and dynamics
- Possible Romanian contributions to the AURORA BOREALIS Icebreaker design and construction:
    a) Maximization of the screw axial force (as reported to the driving mechanical power) - Prof. Dr. Eng. Mircea Dimitrie Cazacu, Polytechnic University Bucharest, Romania
    b) On-board fully operational Dual-energy X-ray Computer Tomograph (dedicated to oceanographic real-time investigations) - Prof. Dr. Duliu Octavian, Bucharest University, Physics Faculty
4. Geological, geophysical and astrophysical research
- Geological evolution and morphology, sedimentation processes, new mineral resources, continental shelf stratigraphy. Research in the area of the Romanian „Law-Racovita” Station in East Antarctica
5. Chemistry
- Chemical research within the connected interdisciplinary studies
6. Polar ecosystems – biodiversity, adaptation and impact of climate change
- Ecosystems of Arctic and Southern Oceans and terrestrial ecosystems
7. Marine microbiology (sea ice, marine/terrestrial/ coast aquatic ecosystems). Microorganisms and   viruses
- In-situ detection and monitoring of the microorganism biodiversity, abundance and activity by molecular biology and genomic techniques
- Micro-niches sustaining microorganism symbiotic consortia in the ocean, marine sediments and extreme environments
- Stress adaptation mechanisms of microbial psychrophiles (as models of adaptation and survival, and analogues of life on other planets in astrobiology); cold-adapted microbial enzymes and their applications
- Viruses and microorganisms preserved in sea ice and coast lakes water; molecular detection and classification of viruses in polar aquatic/marine ecosystems; phycodnaviruses in polar aquatic ecosystems; host-virus relationship determination; (on-board) preparation of natural viral concentrates for subsequent studies
8. Effects of climate change on species long-term prospects
- Monitoring of the species adaptability and biodiversity modification 
9. Biogeochemistry and pedobiology in polar coast areas
- Forming processes of polar criosoils. Enzymes in polar soils, their applications in biotechnologies (water and soil bioremediation and biosensors included) 
10. Polar marine and coastal areas pollution
- Polar environment pollutants (heavy metals, oil products, persistent organic products, radioactive isotopes), contamination paths, depollution methods
11. Medical research in polar zones: 
- Research of the human resistance/adaptability/behaviour/diseases under extreme life and work conditions (in polar expeditions: in research stations, on board of ships, along the polar terrestrial routes). Resistance tests. Nutrition under extreme conditions. 
Research zones: The Arctic and Antarctica, polar expeditions and stations, Romanian “Law-Racovita” Station in East Antarctica included; Arctic and Southern Oceans.

Conclusions 
- The AURORA BOREALIS Icebreaker project will be of great interest for the future development of European (Romanian included) polar studies, in the context of initiating and sustaining future international collaboration.
- A great opportunity of environmental, biological and chemical studies will be the future collaboration between interested Romanian institutes and universities and the Romanian Polar Research Institute, Bucharest
- The collaboration between the Romanian research institutes and universities, as well as the international collaboration, may create a consortium that could work to study the biodiversity of polar ecosystems, as well as the mechanisms of response of polar organisms to environmental conditions and their changes, and other essential parameters and phenomena determining the climate change and the adaptation to it.
- The Symposium was a wide presentation framework for the Romanian polar research and prospects, with a significant visibility and resonance in the European area. 

Following the Workshop, the foreign participants expressed their appreciation related to the scientific manifestation, by many letters, such as:
“I want to thank you very much for your hospitality and the extensive effort from your side to give us a warm welcome to Bucharest. I very much hope that the workshop and the information provided from our side, was to your satisfaction and I will write to the Academy to praise your efforts and the hospitality of the Academy.” [Prof. Dr. Doc. Jörn Thiede, Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]

“Dear Teodor, You have worked very hard and made big steps with the Romanian Polar Programme during this last year and I very much appreciate your friendship and big support. We had very nice times together especially through your personal attention and organization of the major polar workshop in Bucharest and when we have met during the last year. This was a great success and a visible signal to the ministry that the Polar Activity is very important these days with climate change so important on the global political agenda. So I think there will be major steps forward in the national polar research interests in many European countries and we have to be ready to respond to them.” [Dr. Paul Egerton, Executive Director in the European Science Foundation]
