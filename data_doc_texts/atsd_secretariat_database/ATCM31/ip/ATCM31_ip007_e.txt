Summary of Environmental Monitoring and Reporting Discussions
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Abstract
This paper summarises past discussions by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) about environmental monitoring and reporting. It also includes observations on recurring themes and highlights points Australia considers noteworthy. The intention is to provide a central resource for the CEP’s continuing consideration of this important topic.
Background
At CEP X (2007) the Committee agreed to spend time on the issue of Environmental Monitoring and Reporting at its next meeting (Final Report, paragraph 287). During discussion at CEP X Members also emphasised the importance of synthesising the significant amount of information that currently exists.
With the intention of providing a useful reference for current and future discussions, this paper provides:
    • a chronological summary of discussions by the ATCM and CEP on environmental monitoring and reporting (see below and Appendix A);
    • summaries of all papers submitted to the ATCM and CEP on environmental monitoring and reporting (see Appendix B); and
    • Australia’s observations of noteworthy points arising from those papers and discussions.
Brief history of Antarctic environmental monitoring and reporting discussions
The Antarctic Treaty parties have discussed aspects of environmental monitoring for over three and a half decades. Although various “environmental” parameters were recorded in Antarctic much earlier, general recognition of the need to monitor to identify and assess the environmental effects of human activities occurring within the Antarctic Treaty area was reached in the early 1970s. The topic has since been on the agenda of most ATCMs and, since its inception, all meetings of the CEP, although the scope and focus of the debate has varied with time (see Appendix B).
1970s
Following the addition to the ATCM VI (1970) agenda of an item on “The Effects of Man and his Activities upon the Antarctic Environment”, several meetings discussed the need to make observations to better understand the association between human activities and changes in the Antarctic environment. The debate initially concentrated on the impacts of activities within the Antarctic Treaty area, but the need to also consider effects from global pressures was agreed at ATCM VIII (1975). Several Recommendations were adopted, calling on SCAR to provide scientific assistance and urging Parties to take action to contribute to the Parties’ greater collective understanding of “The Effects of Man and his Activities upon the Antarctic Environment”.
1980s
At ATCM XII (1983) the Meeting adopted Recommendation XII-3, which established a requirement for prior environmental assessment of proposed scientific and logistic activities, and expressed the Parties’ agreement that “monitoring of key indicators of environmental effects of such activities is an important element and may call for modification of the activity”. The need to identify such “key indicators” has since been a recurring theme. Recommendation XIII-5 (1985) called on SCAR to advise on ways of improving the comparability and accessibility of scientific data to assist with Parties’ efforts to protect the Antarctic environment. Recommendation XIV-2 (1987) confirmed the environmental assessment process should incorporate “identification of measures, including monitoring programmes, that could be taken to minimise or mitigate impacts and detect possible unforeseen effects”. In each of these cases, the focus was on the effects of activities in Antarctica.
The first ATCM to hold dedicated discussions of environmental monitoring was ATCM XV in 1989, which expanded the discussion to again consider the effects of both local and global pressures. Recommendation XV-5 recognised the value of monitoring not just changes in the environment, but also operational characteristics of activities in Antarctic. It also called on Parties to convene a meeting of experts to discuss a range of matters related to Antarctic environmental monitoring, including cooperative long-term monitoring programs, environmental parameters and methods for data collection and management.
1990s
Attention to environmental monitoring continued through the 1990s, commencing with Parties’ agreement to an array of related requirements through adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1991. A meeting of experts on environmental monitoring held in 1992 proposed a range of general and specific environmental monitoring objectives, which received close consideration and support by ATCM XVII (1992).
To address requests expressed through Recommendation XVII-1, SCAR/COMNAP held a pair of workshops in 1995/96. Discussion at ATCM XXI (1997) of the report of these workshops resulted in agreement to a further series of actions by SCAR and COMNAP to assist with the implementation of monitoring programs.
Following initial discussion at ATCM XX (1996), each subsequent meeting considered the requirements for, and structure of, a state of the Antarctic environment report.
Environmental monitoring and reporting was taken into the CEP agenda from its first meeting in 1998, consistent with its responsibilities for providing advice to the ATCM on those matters. Since then the ATCM has not given direct attention to environmental monitoring and reporting.
2000s
During the present decade CEP meetings and a series of intersessional open-ended contact groups (ICGs) have continued to discuss environmental monitoring and state of the Antarctic environment reporting. While the Committee’s attention alternated between these topics for several years, CEP VIII (2005) agreed on the merits of considering the two matters jointly. 
CEP III (2000) endorsed a COMNAP handbook of techniques for monitoring the environmental impacts of stations, which was supplemented by guidelines for designing monitoring programs in 2005. SCAR and COMNAP also held a workshop in 2005 on “Practical Biological Indicators of Human Impacts in Antarctica”. Many individual CEP Members reported on operational monitoring activities at research stations, and COMNAP produced compilations addressing the environmental monitoring activities of national programs.
The 2004 Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME) agreed the CEP “should clearly address the issue of monitoring and provide the ATCM with recommendations for the coordinated monitoring of activities in Antarctica including the establishment of a consistent methodology and centralized data collection process”.
An ICG on Environmental Monitoring and Reporting convened between CEP VIII and CEP IX undertook a helpful review of previous work but was unable to make considerable headway. CEP X acknowledged the value of lessons learned from Artic experiences with similar matters. 
Observations from past discussions
In Australia’s view, the following points raised in earlier meeting papers and discussions are worth recalling in the CEP’s continuing consideration of environmental monitoring and reporting. 
    1) The possible benefits of establishing a group dedicated to managing a centralised monitoring and reporting system has been raised on several occasions, most recently during consideration of Norway’s paper to CEP X on Arctic monitoring and reporting arrangements (WP29), and during the workshop on “Antarctica’s Future Environmental Challenges” held prior to CEP IX (WP42). As can be seen from Appendix A and Appendix B, Antarctic Treaty Parties and the CEP have spent considerable time over many years discussing through meetings, workshops and intersessional groups the need to monitor and report on the effects of local human activities and global pressures on Antarctic environment, yet there remains no coordinated approach.
    2) The Arctic approach to appointing “lead countries” for aspects of environmental monitoring and reporting has been raised on occasion. For example, in the COMNAP/SCAR Discussion Document submitted to the 1992 Meeting of Experts on Environmental Monitoring in Antarctica, more recently, in Norway’s report to CEP X on the Arctic monitoring programmes (WP29). Application of a similar model has not been discussed in detail by the CEP, but might warrant further consideration (noting that, even with lead countries, there would likely remain the need for central coordination).
    3) It has been noted on several occasions that a centrally coordinated monitoring and reporting system will require effective centralised data management and accessibility (e.g. Recommendation XIII-4, Recommendation XV-5, para. 82 ATCM XVII Final Report). Recommendations on that matter from the 1992 Meeting of Experts prompted action resulting in the establishment of the Antarctic Master Directory and the SCAR/COMNAP Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management, but it is not yet clear to what extent those initiatives can contribute to the CEP’s considerations.
    4) Most ATCM and CEP discussions about environmental monitoring and reporting took place before the establishment of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty. The CEP might wish to consider ways of drawing on the Secretariat’s systems and capabilities. For example:
    • the ATS databases makes searching past records very easy; and
    • a range of “monitoring” information is already collected as part of annual exchange of information.
    5) COMNAP, CCAMLR and SCAR have in the past been willing to assist the ATCM/CEP, and each group is likely to have an important role in a monitoring and reporting system.
    • CCAMLR has repeatedly offered to share its experience and data related to its long-running ecosystem monitoring and reporting work – the CEP might consider taking CCAMLR up on this offer;
    • COMNAP continues to offer to improve access to operational indicators such that this information is more useful for environmental monitoring and reporting purposes – the CEP might consider providing guidance to COMNAP on what information would be useful;
    • SCAR has at times offered to assist by scoping requirements for SAER, identifying key indicators, and summarising existing environmental monitoring data – the CEP might consider requesting SCAR to consolidate and update its advice.
However, there has not recently been a dedicated discussion, through a meeting, workshop or intersessional group, actively involving all relevant ATS bodies to discuss and develop initiatives for cooperative monitoring and reporting.
    6) A number of attempts have been made to identify core/key environmental parameters or indicators (e.g. ATCM VII/ANT15, ATCM XXIII/WP4, SATCM XII/WP22, ATCM XXV/WP31, ATCM XXV/IP7, ATCM XXVII/WP20, ATCM XXVIII/WP10, ATCM XXIX/IP88, ATCM XXX/IP111), but without agreement on a definitive list. Similarly, it has been acknowledged that monitoring and reporting should be targeted to agreed objectives, and several attempts have been made to define suitable objectives (e.g. ATCM XVII/IP9, ATCM XXII/WP11, ATCM XXIII/WP5, ATCM XXIX/WP16), yet there remain no universally agreed objectives. Regardless, a variety of environmental monitoring activities continue to take place, and it has been noted that it would be useful to identify what data are already collected (e.g. Recommendation XVII-1).
    7) The CEP has recently identified through the provisional five-year work plan adopted at CEP X a prioritised list of actions to address environmental issues. The reasoning applied to developing the work plan could similarly be applied to identify important matters to be addressed in an environmental monitoring and reporting framework.
    8) As noted in the report to CEP IX of the environmental monitoring and reporting ICG (WP16), much consideration has been given to operational monitoring, agreed by CEP IX to comprise “a local approach dealing with specific activities and focussed on testing predictions developed through the EIA requirements”:
    • COMNAP has produced several summaries of environmental monitoring activities conducted by national Antarctic programmes (e.g. ATCM XXI IP67, ATCM XXII IP54);
    • individual Parties have submitted reports on operational monitoring activities at stations; and
    • as outlined in the report to CEP IX from the most recent environmental monitoring and reporting ICG, there exist a range of documents providing guidance on operational monitoring.
However there remains no agreed approach to the other main category acknowledged by CEP IX, state of the Antarctic environment monitoring (“a broader approach with the purpose to identify and report on regional or continent-wide environmental changes, irrespective of the cause, as intended by the SAER system”).
    9) With reference to the Condition-Pressure-Response (CPR) or Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework for environmental reporting, there exist many examples of Parties’ individual and collective “Responses”, much of which is reported at annual meetings or through the annual exchange of environmental information. For example:
    • development and implementation of contingency plans in accordance with Article 15;
    • prior environmental impact assessment of all proposed activities;
    • development and implementation of waste management plans in accordance with Annex III, Article 9;
    • adoption of Decisions, Measures, Resolutions relating to environmental matters;
    • designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, Historic Sites and Monuments and Site Guidelines; and 
    • development and implementation of practical environmental guidelines, such as: Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica;  Guidelines for the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Managed Areas; Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica; Practical Guidelines for Ballast Water Exchange in the Antarctic Treaty Area; Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Antarctica; Energy Management Guiding Principles.
