Antarctic Peninsula: Ice shelf status





Antarctic Peninsula: Ice shelf status
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

During the last half-century, the Antarctic Peninsula has experienced dramatic warming at rates several times the global mean.  
The British Antarctic Survey has examined archive and recent aerial photographs and satellite imagery, and mapped the changing extents of ten ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula over the last 50 years.  This is shown pictorially on the colour plan provided during the CEP XI.
