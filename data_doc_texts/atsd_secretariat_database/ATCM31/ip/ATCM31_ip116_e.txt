The Graduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies course

Information Paper submitted by New Zealand


Introduction

The Graduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies (GCAS) is a fourteen week (November-January) course taught by Gateway Antarctica, the Centre for Antarctic Studies and Research at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The course, in its eleventh year, is a multi-disciplinary study of the history, science, political discourse, environmental concerns and future challenges of the Antarctic region.  It includes a two-week Antarctic field component run in partnership with Antarctica New Zealand.  The multidisciplinary perspective along with the broad-based critique of the challenges that Antarctica faces and the Antarctic field component have resulted in a course that is unique in its focus.

Purpose and Goals of GCAS

The aim of GCAS is to provide a contextual programme of study for graduates and members of the professions who have an interest in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.  It provides an ideal course for members of National Antarctic Programs who want to understand better the current issues and want to experience first hand living and working in Antarctica.  

The course content is focused on four central themes: Antarctica as an extreme environment; Global linkages and influences; Science issues; and Policy issues and futures.  

The course aims to:
    • Engage participants in a critical examination of the contemporary scientific, environmental, social and policy issues and debates related to the Antarctic region;
    • Strengthen participants’ abilities to make contributions to Antarctica; and,
    • Experience and gain practical insights into the environments and operating conditions of Antarctica.

Course Delivery

The themes are delivered through lectures, seminars, tutorials, group discussions, self directed studies, oral and written presentations and an Antarctic study trip.

Group discussions
Each year the participants are divided into four syndicate groups, each one of which is assigned a current and often controversial topic to discuss and debate during the course.  Recent topics have included: Historic Huts – Remove, Repair or Restore; Bioprospecting in Antarctica; is it a legitimate commercial activity?; and, The elimination of IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean.

Review
Participants undertake a synthesis and critical review of a topic that relates to an aspect of one of the major themes examined in the course.  Recent review topics include: International conflict in Antarctica; Cultural resource management in Antarctica; Landscape evolution and history of the Dry Valleys; The Ross Ice Streams; Ozone depletion and the effects of enhanced ultraviolet radiation on Antarctica; and, Diving activities in Antarctica and associated risks.

Antarctic study trip
The course provides a unique opportunity for participants to experience living and working in Antarctica.  Most of the time is spent camping on the McMurdo Ice Shelf in close proximity to Scott Base.  The on-ice projects vary from year to year but have included a study of: Dynamics and accumulation history of a part of the McMurdo Ice Shelf; Sub-ice volcano and the history of the West Antarctic ice sheet; Weather patterns in McMurdo Sound; Population dynamics of a seal colony; An environmental impact assessment; Interpreting and communicating personal experiences; and, Science and the media.

Supervised research project
Each participant undertakes an individual research project on an approved topic towards the end of the course.  Recent projects have included: Cultural heritage management and the role of Antarctica New Zealand; Transmission of natural light through snow; Autonomous control of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean; and, Valuing Antarctic gateways; an economic snapshot of Christchurch’s Antarctic connections.

Competency Outcomes

On completion of the course Graduates are expected to have:
    • In-depth knowledge of contemporary research in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean;
    • Ability to engage in critical analysis of major issues;
    • Practical experience and understanding of living and working in extreme environments; and,
    • Advanced skills in group work, self directed studies, oral and written presentation, critical reflection and debate.

Beyond GCAS

    • 52% of the GCAS graduates have had a direct or indirect involvement with Antarctica and Southern Ocean issues in their professional lives
    • 24% regularly incorporate knowledge of Antarctica into their professional work.
    • 7% are in professional positions with regular involvement in Antarctic affairs.
    • 23% have gone on to Antarctic related post graduate degrees.

Further Information

    • The course is taught in English and is restricted to sixteen participants from a range of backgrounds, selected via a competitive process.
    • The course fees are currently set at $NZ5,250 for New Zealand, German, French and Australian citizens, and at $NZ20,000 for other international citizens, including all tuition costs and the Antarctic field component. 
    • Participants from overseas countries who have approval by their national Antarctic programs to take the course will receive a scholarship from Antarctica New Zealand and will pay fees at the domestic rate.
