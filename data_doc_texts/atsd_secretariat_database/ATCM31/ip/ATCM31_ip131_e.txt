offered by Argentina

Argentina informs the XXXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting that between August 25th and September 5th 2008 the XIXth edition of the Antarctic Navigation Course, offered, in Buenos Aires, by the Servicio de Hidrografia Naval of the Argentine Republic, through its Instituto Universitario Naval, will take place.

As has been the case for several years, classes and lectures are delivered in Spanish with simultaneous translation into English, and they feature the participation of thirty instructors and lecturers with outstanding professional and academic backgrounds, as well as expertise and real life experience in Antarctica, who have shown specific interest in the developed curricula, specially prepared both for commercial and Armed Forces naval officers. 

The course’s objectives are, among others, the following:

    • Understand  the theory of maritime operations in Antarctica, general aspects of subjects related to the Antarctic environment, outstanding issues regarding maritime operations and nautical safety in Antarctica, 

    • Understand  the relevant synopsis of survival on land and at sea, first aid, and prevention of oil spills and pollution in the region, 

    • Apply  acquired knowledge as a useful reference to undertake Antarctic maritime operations correctly, 

    • Assess  the complexity, hardship, unpredictability and harshness of the Antarctic environment, as well as the impending need to protect it, applying the most demanding behaviour codes in our planet.

The syllabus is subject to a constant review in light of progress of knowledge, breakthroughs in technique and science and of experience. It encompasses the different disciplines or areas relevant to Antarctica grouped into seven large modules: (i) Antarctic environment, (ii) ecology, (iii) maritime pollution, (iv) International Law and Antarctic Legislation, (v) Nautical Safety, (vi) nautical expertise and recent commanding experience, as well as (vii) survival. 

Throughout its previous eighteen editions, more than six hundred naval officers from twenty three countries have benefited from the knowledge acquired through this course offered by the Servicio de Hidrografia Naval.
