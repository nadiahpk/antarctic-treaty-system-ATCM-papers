Review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection
Information Paper submitted by Australia

Summary
This paper responds to requests by some delegations to the 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXX, 2007) for further information about the background to the Committee for Environmental Protection’s (CEP’s) review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection and for explanations of the CEP’s proposed amendments to the Annex. The paper summarises the discussions that resulted in the revision referred by CEP to ATCM XXVII (2004) and briefly explains the origins of the suggested amendments. For all amendments proposed, Australia has expressed and explained its preference.
Review of proposed amendments
Appendix A to this Information Paper comprises an annotated compilation of all amendments to Annex II proposed to this point. It provides:
    1) brief background to the CEP’s discussion of suggested amendments, with reference to relevant meeting papers and reports;
    2) a summary of subsequent related discussions by the ATCM; and
    3) Australia’s suggestions* for addressing the proposed amendments.
* Australia’s suggestions mostly indicate a preference to accept or reject amendments proposed previously. In a few cases, which are highlighted, new suggestions are made to address issues left unresolved in earlier discussions.

Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora
Change proposed.

The CEP did not reach agreement7 on the wording of the proposed change (see below).


 Retain original. Australia supported the ICG proposal, but believes it is now expeditious to the review process to leave the title of the Annex unchanged.
Alt (ICG)

Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Conservation of Antarctic Living Organisms
The CEP intersessional open-ended contact group on Review of Annex II (ICG) proposed3,5 that the title be changed to “Conservation of Antarctic Living Organisms” because, from a scientific-technical point of view, that would better reflect the purposes of the Annex.

This suggestion stemmed from SCAR’s advice2 that the terms “flora” and “fauna” has proved difficult to apply objectively to some of the lower organisms.

Discussions held at ATCM XXIX reached informal agreement9 that: (1) the title of the Annex should remain unchanged; and (2) similarly, proposed amendments throughout the Annex to refer to “Antarctic living organisms” should be rejected.

“marine species” means any invertebrate, plant or any species of vertebrate, other than Antarctic mammals or birds, at any stage of its life cycle, occurring naturally in the Antarctic marine waters; 
The CEP agreed to propose7 that a new definition for “marine species” should be added, to reflect its proposal that Article 3.4 of the Annex provide for designation of marine species as Specially Protected Species (SPS). The CEP did not reach agreement7 on the wording of the proposed change (see below).

The CEP’s proposal reflected its agreement to a recommendation in the SPS ICG3 that “from scientific and conservation perspectives, the SPS provisions of Annex II should in principle, be extended to all species indigenous in the Antarctic Treaty Area (or occurring there seasonally through natural migrations)”.

This matter was discussed by the Legal and Institutional Working Group at ATCM XXX, which reached informal agreement that a new definition for “marine species” should not be added.

(g) "take" or "taking" means to kill, injure, capture, handle or molest, a native mammal or bird, or to remove or damage such quantities of native plants that their local distribution or abundance would be significantly affected;
Change proposed. The CEP agreed the definition of “take” or “taking” should be extended to incorporate reference to invertebrates, considering comments from SCAR2 that the original definition of “take” or “taking” fails to include “invertebrates” although “invertebrates” are defined in the original Article 1(d).

The CEP did not reach agreement7 on the wording of the proposed change (see below).

Alt (ICG)

"take" or "taking" means to kill, injure, capture, handle or molest, an Antarctic mammal or bird, or an Antarctic Specially Protected Species, or to remove or damage such quantities of Antarctic plants or such numbers of Antarctic invertebrates that their local distribution or abundance would be significantly affected; 
The ICG’s proposed5 alternative definition incorporated reference to invertebrates, but referred to “Antarctic mammals or birds” and “Antarctic invertebrates”. 

Although there was informal agreement9 at ATCM XXIX that the title should remain unchanged and that references throughout the Annex to “Antarctic living organism” should be rejected, as mentioned above, ATCM XXIX did not determine that the descriptor “Antarctic” was preferable to “native” in the Article 1 definitions for mammals, birds, plants and invertebrates.

The new definition proposed by the ICG also included reference to SPS, the intention being to incorporate in the definition of “take” or “taking” – and hence include within the scope of Article 3.1 – marine species designated as SPS. Note: mammals or birds are covered by the definition – and hence the provisions of Article 3.1 – irrespective of their status as SPS.

As mentioned above, the matter of “marine species” was discussed by the Legal and Institutional Working Group at ATCM XXX, which reached informal agreement that the SPS provisions would not apply to marine species and that, consequently, a definition of “marine species” was not required.

 Maintaining use of the term “native” is consistent with ongoing CEP discussions of “Quarantine and Non-native Species”.

There was informal agreement to this version during Legal and Institutional Working Group discussions at ATCM XXX.
Alt (Russian Federation)


The Russian Federation proposed10 that Article 1(g) should be supplemented by derivatives referring to “irretrievable taking” and “taking with return to nature”.
X This matter was discussed during the first round of ICG discussions. The CEP subsequently agreed at CEP VII to leave the definition of “take” or “taking” unchanged in this respect.

2. Each Party shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee before the end of November of each year of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1 above and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 1st July to 30th June.
Change proposed. The CEP proposed7 amending this paragraph to reflect the dates for information exchange agreed in Resolution 6(2001). The CEP did not reach agreement7 on the wording of the proposed change (see below). (see below).

Alt (ICG)

As early as possible, after the end of each austral summer season, but in all cases before October 1st of each year, the Parties shall inform the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1 above, and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 01 April – 31 March.
The ICG’s proposed version suggested that Parties should inform the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in addition to other Parties and the Committee.

It also proposed retaining this as a paragraph in its own right.

Alt (UK)

As early as possible, after the end of each austral summer season, but in all cases before October 1st of each year, the Parties shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1 (a) and (b) above, and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 01 April – 31 March.
The UK’s proposed version did not include reference to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, and suggested re-drafting this as an additional sub-paragraph under original paragraph 1.

Alt (Australia)

As early as possible, after the end of each austral summer season, but in all cases before October 1st of each year, the Parties shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1 above, and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 01 April – 31 March.
Australia’s proposed version:

(1) updates the reporting period to reflect current practice under Resolution 6(2001);

(2) retains the original reference to “paragraph 1 above” for simplicity, to avoid consequential drafting arrangements; and

(3) retains the original wording “inform the other Parties as well as the Committee” noting that this is consistent with wording in other Annexes (e.g. Annex V Article 10.2) and acknowledging that the Secretariat will facilitate the reporting to other Parties and the Committee.

The UK proposed6 amending this paragraph, noting “There may be merit in including derogation to both the CBD and ACAP under Article 7”.
x Noting that the CEP did not reach agreement on this proposed change, and expecting that this might be the point of considerable debate, Australia believes it is expeditious to disregard this proposed amendment.
