Preliminary results of the Russian studies under the IPY Program in 2007 and during the season 2007/2008

On 1 March, 2007, the International Polar Year 2007-2008 (IPY 2007/08) began.  Its events combine efforts of tens of thousands of scientists and investigators from 63 countries. Intensive activities were also observed in the Antarctic, including the Russian studies. In accordance with the Implementation Plan of the “Scientific Program of Participation of the Russian Federation in Holding the International Polar Year 2007/08”, 24 field projects were carried out in 2007 in the Antarctic. Information on the most interesting results of implementing the IPY Projects is presented below.
First of all, a complex of studies of the subglacial Lake Vostok should be noted here, which are carried out under the Project “Environmentally clean penetration and comprehensive study of the subglacial Lake Vostok”. During the seasonal period of the 52nd RAE, drilling operations in deep borehole 5G-1 were resumed at Vostok station after a year of interruption. About 90 m to the contact of glacier with lake water remains. The work was carried out for sampling and investigation of the lake ice core and preparation for penetration to Lake Vostok. The obtained ice core was formed of monocrystalline ice with a size of crystals up to 1.5 m. This determines the increased hardness of ice formed of frozen water and creates serious problems for drilling. Eighteen meters of the accreted ice core was recovered and part of it was sent to the Russian laboratories for conducting detailed studies. 
In addition, using seismic sounding and radio-echo profiling over the entire lake area, studies of morphometry characteristics of the subglacial Lake Vostok were continued. They provide detailed information on the thickness of ice, water layer and bottom sediments of the lake, and also on configuration of its coastline. According to updated information, the area of the lake without the islands comprises about 16000 km2. The lake coastline is complicated by numerous capes, bays and islands, located predominantly in the southern and western parts of the lake. The thickness of the glacial cover of the territory under consideration changes from 2550 to 4350 m. The maximum values are observed in the northern and northwestern parts of Lake Vostok. 
Interesting results were obtained from joint Russian-German studies at the profile in the Southern Ocean in the area of Kerguellen Plateau (the Commonwealth Sea) with participation of the research vessels "Akademik Aleksander Karpinsky" and "Polarstern". The seismic profile extended from 65o to 66.5o S. The joint expedition carried out a total of 5000 km of profile seismic, gravimetric and magnetometric observations; 37 mooring deployments;   4000 km of aeromagnetic observations (from helicopter of the R/V “Polarstern”) and 500 km of wide-angle seismic profiling from two ships (the acoustic signal was generated onboard the R/V “Polarstern” and received onboard the R/V “Akademik Karpinsky”). The following data were obtained:
    • the Earth’s crust structure of the Commonwealth Sea and the southern part of the Kerguellen Plateau to a depth of more than 20 km; 
    • Geodynamics of separation of India and Antarctica that comprised one common continent 150 million years ago; 
    • History of seabed submerging of the Commonwealth Sea – Kerguellen Plateau and evolution of water circulation of the Indian Ocean in the geological past;
    • Physical properties of the Earth’s crust of the continental margin, oceanic basin and the volcanic Kerguellen Plateau;
    • Influence of Antarctic glaciation on the formation of the sedimentary mantle of the Commonwealth Sea.
The work was performed in the framework of the IPY Project “History of geodynamic development, sedimentation and environmental changes in the area of the Commonwealth Sea – Kerguellen Plateau, East Antarctica”.
In the framework of seasonal activities of the 52nd RAE, marine studies were conducted under the project “Oceanographic studies in the Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean” of the Implementation Plan of the Scientific Program of Participation of the Russian Federation in Holding the International Polar Year 2007/08.
During the period 17 to 21 January 2007, 3 meridional oceanographic transects were made (СТD – soundings) in the eastern Commonwealth Sea along 62, 64 and 70° E, a total of 29 stations. During the period 20 to 22 February, an oceanographic transect in the Lazarev Sea was made along 15° E at the range of latitudes from 65° to 69°15’ E, consisting of 13 stations.
Transects in the Commonwealth and Lazarev Seas present a Russian contribution to the cluster project of IPY 2007/08 No. 8 (Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction Study - SASSI).
As a result of the studies in the Commonwealth Sea:
    • An experimental confirmation of the Antarctic bottom water formation in this region was obtained with its sinking being manifested in low temperature and salinity values in the near-bottom layer above the continental slope. 
    • It was determined  that the observed bottom water result from mixing of modified circumpolar deep water with cold shelf water formed predominantly in the south of Prydz Bay near the Amery Ice Shelf.
    • The detected bottom water of Prydz Bay moves then along the slope to the west and downwards through canyons and depressions. The temperature of this bottom water comprises –0.3 to –1.6°С and salinity is 34.54 – 34.62 ppt. 
    • It is shown that the intensity of sinking of forming bottom water downward the continental slope increases westward, with shelf narrowing and increasing slope of its bottom.
During the period 8 to 14 February 2007,  transect between Africa and Antarctica (from 35 to 65° S) was made using expendable bathy-thermographs (ХВТ), comprised of 108 stations with a sounding depth of 750 m. This transect is a Russian contribution to the cluster project of IPY 2007/08 No. 132 “Climate of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean” – CASO).
The work under the SASSI and CASO Projects were continued during the season of the 53rd RAE. The following was carried out:
    • ХВТ – Australia – Antarctica transect: 69 soundings were made during the period 17 to 21 January 2008 en-route of ship transit from Melbourne to Leningradskaya station. This transect was located from the point of 45°00’S, 143°09’E to 63°39’S, 156°35’E. The sounding depth was 460 m.
    • ХВТ – Antarctica-Africa transect: 111 soundings were made during the period 28 February,2008 to 5 March, 2008. The sounding depth was 760 m.
    • CTD – transect in the Amundsen Sea: 15 deepwater (from the surface to the bottom) stations were made during the period 14 to 16 February, 2008. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and concentrations of silicon, phosphates, nitrates, nitrites and ammonia were determined. In addition, 4 ХВТ-soundings were made.
    • CTD – episodic stations. 
In the coastal zone in the vicinity of Progress station, studies of species diversity and the numbers of population of different benthic forms were carried out for the first time using skin-divers. As a result, the structure and distributions of bottom biocenoses were obtained and estimates of the ice biota numbers and biomass in the coastal zone of Nella Bay were given. These studies are a Russian contribution to the IPY Project “Evolution and biodiversity in the Antarctic”.
Research organizations from 23 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, China, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the USA, the Ukraine, Uruguay, Finland, France, Chile, SAR, South Korea and Japan) participate in the IPY Project “Comprehensive Meteorological dataset of active IPY Antarctic measurement phase for Scientific and Applied Studies” (COMPASS) with the leading role of Russia.
In the COMPASS Project, current synoptic solar radiation and upper-air information is collected from national and foreign Antarctic stations. The collected data undergo one common comprehensive control including a comparative analysis of data of neighboring surface stations, including the automatic meteorological stations. Based on the archived and operational data, the parameters of climatic variability of the atmosphere in the South Polar area are estimated and published at the AARI internet-site (http://www.aari.aq). It was determined that the main source of uncertainty in the estimates of parameters of the trends of meteorological elements is the non-uniformity of historical data obtained by means of different measuring instruments. A change of the sensors, measurement time and incomplete time series are the causes of non-uniformity. A traditional approach to an assessment of trend parameters is based on the analysis of the time series of anomalies of mean monthly values. Thus method yields good results for meteorological series with a high degree of data completeness. However for surface Antarctic data and for upper-air data at significant heights there is a problem of calculating the mean monthly values for the “incomplete” months. For such cases, a method of calculating the parameters of the trends of anomalies of meteorological parameters using a linear regression of measured values taking into account the correlation within a series. Special attention is given to reconstruction of the Russian circumpolar Antarctic environmental monitoring network. In connection with deployment of automatic meteorological stations at the meteorological sites of Molodezhnaya, Russkaya and Leningradskaya stations, a detailed statistical analysis of climatic conditions in the area of the indicated stations was performed for providing data quality control.
In the framework of the CLICOPEN Project (Impact of Climate Induced Glacial Melting on Marine Coastal Communities off the Western Antarctic Peninsula), influence of the melting of glaciers in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula on the dynamics of local marine, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems was investigated. At the Russian Bellingshausen station, coastal hydrological measurements, interrupted 15 years ago, were reconstructed. A three-year monitoring of seasonal variations of parameters of zooplankton community in the marine environment (Ardley Bay) and in freshwater water bodies (Lake Kitezh) was organized. The project participants are provided with necessary meteorological information. As a result of the CLICOPEN Project, the main food webs in the regional ecosystems were determined. Systematization of lichens on King George Island was carried out. The List of local species of lichens is presented at the AARI Internet-site (http://www.aari.aq).
In the ANTPAS Project (Antarctic Permafrost and Soils), a geo-cryological polygon was occupied near Bellingshausen station, on which three area surveys of the parameters of active permafrost layers were made in 2006-2008 using the methodology of the International CALM Program. Experimentally, a record thickness of the seasonal melting layer equal to 158 cm was determined. Soil samples for laboratory studies of methanogenic bacteria were collected. Air samples for determining the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the surface layer above the geo-cryological polygon were collected. The results of the analysis were compared with baseline methane concentrations in the Antarctic atmosphere. 
Studies on the IPY Project “POLAR-AOD”: a network to characterize the means, variability, and trends of the climate-forcing properties of aerosols in polar regions” were carried out. During the observation season of 2006/07 using a method of solar photometry, a complex of measurements of spectral aerosol extinction of solar radiation was continued in Mirny Observatory. 
For the entire observation period, significant interannual variability of the atmosphere optical thickness was determined only by the consequences of strong volcanic eruptions. In several months after the eruptions of El-Chichon volcano in April 1982 and then Pinatubo volcano in June and Hudson volcano in August 1991, the aerosol turbidity of the atmosphere increased several times (and transparency decreased). In these episodes, the increase of the optical thickness was determined first of all by the emission of volcanic eruption products to the stratosphere, i.e., by stratospheric aerosol. As a result, the effect of atmospheric transparency decrease in Antarctica was observed in these cases for one year and a half and longer. 
During the “inter-volcanic” periods and in recent years, the values of spectral aerosol extinction of solar radiation measured in Antarctica, are among the lowest on the Earth and characterize essentially the “initial boundary” of natural global background of aerosol turbidity of the atmosphere.
