Report by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) on “Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters”


Introduction


The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) appreciates the opportunity to brief the XXXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), on the progress made in the Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters. This report covers the period since the XXXth ATCM.   
The IHO has continued to make great efforts in conjunction with several other international organizations to raise awareness on the importance of improving the priority assigned to conduct hydrographic surveys in Antarctica. It has to be noted the strong support received from these international organizations in this endeavour. 
Antarctica continues to be of high concern to the IHO and therefore its Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica has been tasked to do its best in coordinating and cooperating with all principal actors, aiming at safety of life at sea, safety of navigation, the protection of the marine environment and the progress in marine scientific research in Antarctica.     

The IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica
The 7th Meeting of the IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) took place at the Centro Naval in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 3-5 October 2007 organized by the Servicio de Hidrografia Naval.
The Chairman, Capt Gorziglia (IHB Director) opened the meeting welcoming the 13 HCA Member States present (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Norway, United Kingdom and USA) and observers from Peru, Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, COMNAP, IAATO and SCAR. It has to be highlighted that since the last ATCM, Peru and USA have signed the Statutes of the HCA and therefore have become full members of the Commission, the total number of which is now 19.  (Annex A)
At the meeting, the Commission considered different matters including the issue of membership; the status of the action list agreed at the last meeting; the outcome of the XXX ATCM; the IHO 5 Year Work Program approved by the XVIIth International Hydrographic Conference in May 2007 and the status of nautical charting.  
Taking advantage of the venue, the AT Executive Secretary offered an excellent presentation on the activities and work coordinated by the Secretariat and hosted a social event for all HCA participants at the ATS headquarters. 

1.- HCA Membership.
The Commission, after reviewing the situation, decided to invite those IHO Member States that are not yet HCA members and that comply with the requisites, to consider joining the HCA, especially those under the condition of “pending confirmation of membership”. That is the case of Japan, Rep. of Korea, Poland, Ukraine and Uruguay. 
It is reminded that according to HCA Statutes, “Membership of the Commission is open to any IHO Member State whose government has acceded to the Antarctic Treaty and which contributes resources and/or data to IHO INT Chart coverage of Region M (south of parallel 60o S.)  and which becomes a signatory to the Statutes of the Commission.”

2.- Status of Actions Agreed.
The Committee reviewed the status of the actions agreed at the last meeting and confirmed that almost all actions had been completed.  
One of the topics that generated an interesting discussion was the Application of SOLAS Convention, Chapter V, Regulation 9, in Antarctic waters.  It seems that this is an ongoing matter, as the report submitted to ATCM XXX seeks the ATS position as regard to who assumes the obligation/responsibility for the provision of hydrographic services in Antarctica, an issue that does not seem to have been discussed in this forum. The Commission has been discussing the applicability of SOLAS V Regulation 9 in the Antarctic Treaty area that requires contracting governments to arrange for the provision of hydrographic services. A better understanding is only expected after some precisions are made by the ATCM.  See Annex B.   
3.- Outcome of the XXXth ATCM 
In brief, the IHO report was very well received at the XXXth ATCM and the proposal for a seminar to be organized during the XXXI ATCM to raise awareness on the importance of hydrographic activities in Antarctica was welcomed. The HCA paid close attention to this initiative and its Members have been working hard in the preparation of this event, the program of which is provided in Annex C. It will be held on Monday 09 June. 
Following comments provided by SCAR emphasizing that high quality bathymetric maps are needed not only for navigation but also for science it was recommended that all countries using multibeam echo sounders on the Southern Ocean should plan ship tracks to ensure that gaps in bathymetric coverage are filled and that the data be submitted to the appropriate World Data Centre. This is strongly supported by the IHO, and the HCA is exploring ways to improve coordination in this sense, mainly through the IBCSO.  
Also COMNAP stressed that accurate charts are essential and that there was an urgent need to uphold, and where necessary clarify, responsibilities of both government and private sector operators. Several Parties agreed that the work of this IHO HCA Commission was particularly important and that resources and funding should be provided to undertake hydrographic charting in Antarctica.
It was made clear that it was urgent to assign a high priority to hydrographic survey activities.
4.- IHO 5 Years Work Program 
The HCA examined the approved IHO 5 Years Work program an fully agree with the plan to have HCA meetings each year as it was felt vital to keep the pressure on the coordination required to improve the availability of INT charts covering Antarctica. 
The HCA also noted that the plan considers not only the provision of the above mentioned seminar, but similar events in association with COMNAP and IAATO in the following years, 2009 and 2010, respectively.    
5.- Status of Nautical Charting.  Annex D
The Commission reviewed the progress made on INT chart scheme and production in Region M, where out of the 100 charts which form the scheme, 59 had been published as of April 2008.  Especial attention was given to the 33 charts for which there was no information on the progress so far reached. On one side we have experienced that some HOs have Antarctic INT Charts in a very low priority and on the other, we have some charts for which there are no volunteers to compile and produce them. The HCA is taking some actions in order to solve these shortcomings.    
The Commission approved a draft ENC scheme submitted by the IHB for small scales in Antarctica. The producer HO will normally be that of the INT chart on which the ENC has been based. Also  a medium scale ENC scheme was examined that today is in the revision process before its adoption.  Finally the Commission agreed on the need to develop a large scale ENC scheme, task that is in progress at the IHB.
6.- Next HCA Meeting 
Following the kind invitation from the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation from Brazil, the Committee decided to accept the invitation and agreed to have the 8th HCA meeting in Niteroi, Brazil, 06-08 October 2008. We take this opportunity to invite the Executive Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat to attend the HCA Meeting. 
Conclusions

    1) There is a good reciprocal understanding between the IHO HCA Members and other international organizations interested in Antarctica. The ATS needs to consider adopting some coordination at a governmental level aiming at assigning a much higher priority to hydrographic survey activities and chart production. Also consideration should be given to the appropriateness of adopting  the SOLAS V Regulation 9 concept, so that hydrographic and cartographic activities progress not only on a voluntary basis.     
    2) There has been a very low progress in the production and availability of INT Charts, mainly due to the lack of new surveys.  The only way to revert this process is enhancing the priorities of hydro-cartographic activities.   
    3) The IHO through its HCA has prepared a set of special presentations in the form of a Seminar, aimed at sharing with the XXXI ATCM Delegates the concern of the hydrographic community derived from the low or almost non existent hydro-cartographic activity in Antarctica. 
Recommendations

It is recommended that the XXXI ATCM : 
    1. Takes note of the IHO Report. 
    2. Takes action as regard to the conclusions in the report.

ANNEX B
Discussion paper on SOLAS V

The Safe of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention),  Chapter V “Safety of Navigation”, Regulation 9 “Hydrographic Services” provides a clear rules to Contracting Governments to SOLAS on what it is expected from them as regard to the collection, compilation, publication, dissemination and keeping up to date nautical information required for safe navigation. 
The text of Reg. 9 (provided as an Appendix) seems to refer to the geographic areas of which a Contracting Government is responsible for, let us say as an example, its own territorial sea, its ports, etc. 
This Regulation clearly establishes the responsibility for the provision of hydrographic services with Contracting Governments that must undertake to arrange, cooperate, coordinate and ensure these services.  It is evident that the preparation and issuing of nautical charts and other publications is the responsibility of the Contracting Governments, but how can this concept be applied in Antarctica where Contracting Governments to SOLAS do not own territorial waters, ports, etc.?
According to Reg.9 Contracting Governments are urged to provide these services but due to the different nature of Antarctica, the provision of hydrographic services in that part of the world is based only on voluntary basis. Under this perspective we might find that nobody feels responsible for conducting hydrographic surveys and charting the Antarctic waters, and in fact all those executing surveys and producing charts have neither obligation nor a commitment to do so. 
In the rest of the world we have a Contracting Government that shall undertake these activities, and the mariner is full aware of that, but what is the situation in Antarctica?  Who is responsible for surveying Antarctic waters? Is there any body feeling to have the responsibility for the provision of nautical charts?  
The IHO/HCA coordinates the efforts mainly to speed up the availability of INT Charts in Antarctica; avoid duplication and standardize the processes and final products. The result is that on voluntary basis some areas are considered, then surveyed and charted but is the HO’s country that produced a nautical chart liable for this nautical chart? The dimension seems to be different whether somebody acts as “volunteer” or has the obligation to provide a service. The fact that there is no clear indication on who shall provide hydrographic services in Antarctica is a problem that needs to be addressed.   
Just playing with words we can organize a couple of sentences to illustrate the situation. For example:   
According to SOLAS  Reg. 9, the responsibility for providing hydrographic services of the Port of Valparaiso is with the Contracting Government :  CHILE 
According to SOLAS  Reg. 9, the responsibility for providing hydrographic services of the Deception Island  is with the Contracting Government :   xxxxxx (there is none)
As in principle none of the AT Members feels obliged to provide hydrographic services for a particular area of Antarctica, it is likely that it will take too long before the INT Chart scheme is completed. But that is not the end, as charts need to be kept updated.  
Can the Antarctic Treaty System take advantage of the concept under Regulation 9 in order to enhance the provision of hydrographic services in Antarctica?

Safety of Navigation
Regulation 9
Hydrographic services

1	Contracting Governments undertake to arrange for the collection and compilation of hydrographic data and the publication, dissemination and keeping up to date of all nautical information necessary for safe navigation.
2	In particular, Contracting Governments undertake to co-operate in carrying out, as far as possible, the following nautical and hydrographic services, in the manner most suitable for the purpose of aiding navigation:
        1. to ensure that hydrographic surveying is carried out, as far as possible, adequate to the requirements of safe navigation;
        2. to prepare and issue nautical charts, sailing directions, lists of lights, tide tables and other nautical publications, where applicable, satisfying the needs of safe navigation;
        3. to promulgate notices to mariners in order that nautical charts and publications are kept, as far as possible, up to date; and
        4. to provide data management arrangements to support these services.

    3 Contracting Governments undertake to ensure the greatest possible uniformity in charts and nautical publications and to take into account, whenever possible, relevant international resolutions and recommendations. **
    4 Contracting Governments undertake to co-ordinate their activities to the greatest possible degree in order to ensure that hydrographic and nautical information is made available on a world-wide scale as timely, reliably, and unambiguously as possible.

XXXI ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING
Kiev, Ukraine,  Monday 09, June 2008 

SEMINAR
Importance of Hydrographic Activities in Antarctica
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)
Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA)

Background

The Antarctic Treaty System has recognized the traditional role played by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) through its Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica, in contributing to the safety of navigation, the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, including scientific purposes.

The international cooperation and coordination between countries which undertake hydrographic surveys and nautical charting of Antarctic waters is absolutely necessary to provide mariners and scientists with data, information, products and services to minimize the risks associated with their activities. 

However set against the increasing numbers of people visiting and working in the region for a range of  different activities, the progress so far reached by Hydrographic Offices under the umbrella of the IHO/HCA in the production of a reliable and updated set of nautical charts is far from being appropriate. This is in terms of coverage and fidelity to modern survey standards. 

In keeping with the Antarctic Treaty no single nation has specific responsibility for charting but all are stakeholders with an international commitment to the safety of life at sea (SOLAS). Accordingly assigning a higher priority to the hydrographic activities, at national levels in each office, monitored and supported by the IHO through the HCA has been identified as one of the most relevant measures that could contribute to improve safety to navigation in Antarctic waters. 

The XXXth ATCM accepted the offer of IHO/HCA to organize and deliver a Seminar at the XXXIst ATCM to highlight the important role and contribution hydrography is called play as regard to the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty System.           

Objective:

To raise awareness at the politico-strategic level on the importance of hydrographic activity in the Antarctica,  to achieve a better understanding in the ATCM of the risks presently attached to the mariner with the status of charting in the region and what the same data also contributes to scientific endeavour, and to seek support on ways to improve the situation.






Programme:	


The Seminar will be delivered on Monday 09 June 2008 for a period of two hours, as part of the Programme of the XXXI ATCM. 

The content includes Opening Remarks (5 minutes) and 5 Presentations of 20 minutes each, the details of which are provided in the Annex. There will be a 15 minutes period for questions from the audience.  

A CD ROM with all Presentations will be provided to participants and to the AT Secretariat. ATS and IHO might wish to post Presentations in their respective websites to facilitate access by interested parties. 

As an outcome of the Seminar it is expected that a concrete proposal/recommendation will be prepared and supported by several AT Member State and submitted to the ATCM XXXI for consideration and approval.
