Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the Thirty-First Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting





Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the Thirty-First Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
Introduction

    1. The Twenty-Sixth Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) was held in Hobart from 22 October to 2 November 2007. A number of routine matters were addressed along with notable specific issues, including:
    • CCAMLR fisheries in 2006/07;
    • Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing;
    • Ecosystem monitoring and management ;
    • Deep-sea bottom fishing;
    • By-catch in longline and trawl fisheries;
    • Marine Protected Areas;
    • Co-operation with international organizations, particularly the ATCM, and
    • Performance review of the organisation.
    2. CCAMLR’s deliberations on the issues identified in paragraph (1), and others, are summarised below. Emphasis is given to items that are particularly relevant to the ATCM XXXI and CEP XI agendas. An overall summary of important discussions and decisions from CCAMLR XXVI is provided in Appendix I along with references to the meeting’s report paragraphs. 
CCAMLR Fisheries in 2006/07
    3. Fisheries in the CAMLR Convention Area during 2006/07 (1 December 2006 to 30 November 2007) targeted Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and krill (Euphausia superba). The 2006/07 catches reported in CCAMLR-XXVI were interim catches, and the revised numbers will be published in Volume 20 of the CCAMLR Statistical Bulletin (http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/intro.htm).
    4. The reported catch of Dissostichus spp. in 2006/07 (to 30 November 2007) was 16328 tonnes, taken predominantly by longlining, compared to 16843 tonnes in the previous season (1 December 2005 to 30 November 2006).  It is estimated that, in addition to reported catches, some 3615 tonnes of Dissostichus spp. were taken as a result of IUU fishing in the Convention Area during 2006/07, compared with 3420 tonnes in 2005/06. The total global catch for Dissostichus spp. in 2006/07 was estimated at 26722 tonnes, compared with 30053 tonnes the previous season. For further discussion on IUU fishing, please refer to CCAMLR-XXVI, paragraphs 10.1 to 10.6 (see also paragraph 10.7 to 10.50). 
    5. The reported krill catch in 2006/07 (to 30 November 2007) was 104586 tonnes compared with 106591 tonnes in the previous season. The reported catch in 2006/07 was well below the notified catch (368 000 tonnes; SC-CAMLR-XXV, paragraph 4.19). Annual catches of krill have remained in the relatively stable range of krill catches (80 000 to 120 000 tonnes) since 1992/93 
    6. The discrepancy in reported and notified krill catches for 2006/07 has been attributed to operational considerations such as fuel costs and processing difficulties.   
    7. However, the notified 2007/08 krill catch was 684 000 tonnes, an effective doubling of the notified catches for 2006/07 and in excess of five times the current catch level. The catches notified for 2007/08 are also higher than the catch trigger level for subdividing the precautionary catch limits for krill in Area 48. 
    8. Once again, CCAMLR has noted that the krill fishery’s pattern of operation is changing and this emphasizes the need to obtain sufficient information from the current fishery to meet future management needs. This is vital should the fishery become concentrated in any particular region or subarea, including small-scale management units. To this effect the Commission is focusing on orderly development of the krill fishery, improvement of the krill fishery notification system, systematic scientific observer coverage and ensuring that the trigger level in Area 48 should not be exceeded until a method to sub-divide allowable catches is developed and implemented.
    9. The Commission adopted conservation measures (CMs) for all fisheries to be conducted in the 2007/08 season, as well as general measures for regulating fishing activities and reporting fisheries information from the Convention Area.  The most notable new CMs provide for notification of participation in the krill fishery (CM 21-03) and management of bottom fishing in the CCAMLR Area (CM 22-06). All measures are published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2007/08 available from the CCAMLR Secretariat or the website: http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cm/07-08/toc.htm.
    10. In addition to the Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp. and conservation measures to manage specific fisheries directly (e.g. the setting of catch limits and other conditions affecting fishing), other CCAMLR measures include:
    • The CCAMLR System of Inspection;
    • Interim prohibition on deep-sea gillnetting and restrictions on the use of bottom trawling gear;
    • General environmental protection during fishing;
    • Scheme to Promote Compliance by both Contracting and Non-Contracting Party Vessels, including provisions for compiling a list of IUU vessels;
    • Licensing and Inspection Obligations of Contracting Parties with regard to their Flag Vessels Operating in the Convention Area;
    • Promoting compliance with CCAMLR CMs by Contracting Party nationals
    • Procedures for port inspections of vessels carrying Toothfish;
    • Marking of Fishing Vessels and Fishing Gear; 
    • Automated Satellite-Linked Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS); and
    • Various Resolutions – (a) “Banning Driftnet Fishing in the Convention Area”, (b) “Harvesting Species Occurring Both within and Outside the Convention Area”, (c) “Implementation of the CDS by Acceding States and Non-Contracting Parties”, (d) “Use of Ports not Implementing the CDS”, (e) “Application of VMS in the CDS”, (f) “Use of VMS and Other Measures to Verify CDS Catch Data for Areas Outside the Convention Area, Especially FAO Statistical Area 51”; (g) “Harvesting of D. eleginoides in Areas Outside Coastal State Jurisdiction Adjacent to the Convention Area in FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57”, (h) “Vessels Flying Flags of Non-Compliance”, (i) “Ice Strengthening Standards in High Latitude Fisheries”, (j) a “Non-Contracting Party Co-Operation Programme” and (k) “International actions to reduce the incidental mortality of seabirds arising from fishing”.
Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Fishing 
    11. IUU fishing for Dissostichus spp. in the Convention Area has been a major issue for the Commission since 1997. CCAMLR gives high priority to eliminating such fishing and implements an integrated suite of administrative, political and enforcement-related measures to address the problem consistent with international best practice. 
    12. CCAMLR’s efforts to combat IUU fishing continue to take place against a background of ongoing and vigorous action by individual CCAMLR Contracting Parties in areas under their national jurisdiction.  
    13.  Nevertheless, CCAMLR has again requested its Members to increase surveillance in the Convention Area, particularly in the Indian Ocean Statistical Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2 and 58.4.3b. It is also developing a probability matrix to be used to improve the determination of IUU catches.  
    14. To facilitate exchange of relevant information amongst its Members, CCAMLR maintains a database on vessels known to have fished in contravention of CCAMLR Conservation Measures. Such vessels are incorporated annually into an official “CCAMLR IUU Vessel List” which can be found at http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/sc/fish-monit/iuu-vess.htm along with a list of vessels licensed to fish in CCAMLR waters (http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/sc/fish-monit/vess-licensed.htm). CCAMLR also uses a centralized, satellite-based vessel monitoring system (c-VMS) in the CCAMLR Secretariat to monitor the movements of fishing vessels in the Convention Area. This system has allowed surveillance to be more efficiently deployed.
    15. CCAMLR continues to interact with various other international and regional fisheries organisations, especially those with responsibility for waters adjacent to the Convention Area. Such interaction includes the exchange of information on issues such as IUU fishing, seabird incidental mortality and other matters relevant to CCAMLR.
Ecosystem Monitoring and Management
    16. The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP) collects long-term data on various Antarctic marine ecosystem components as well as the environment. These data are used to provide annual assessments of ecosystem status.
    17. The Commission endorsed a variety of scientific advice on estimating B0 (initial exploitation biomass) for krill in various statistical areas. This parameter forms the basis for estimating krill precautionary catch levels.
    18. The CCAMLR scientific community continues to explore ways in which ecosystem advice can be formally incorporated into management decisions. In this respect, the Commission afforded high priority to:
    • On-going development of management procedures to allocate the precautionary krill catch limit in the Southwest Atlantic (Area 48) to Small Scale Management Units (SSMUs);
    • Further development of ecosystem models to take into account the complex interactions between predators, target species and fisheries other than the krill fishery;
    • Further consideration of bioregionalisation in the context of marine protected areas (see paragraph 26 below);
    • Further modelling work to include a special Workshop to be held in June 2008 to provide abundance estimates of land-based predators as well as a joint CCAMLR-IWC Workshop on Antarctic ecosystem model inputs in August 2008, and
    • The Scientific Committee considering how to address the issue of climate change in relation to conservation of Antarctic marine living resources within its agenda. 
By-Catch in Longline and Trawl Fisheries
    19. CCAMLR leads the world in implementing measures to reduce seabird mortality during longline fishing. Many CCAMLR measures, particularly the provisions of Conservation Measure 25-03 (first adopted in 1992), have been incorporated into the FAO International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds) adopted by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI). A number of CCAMLR Members have developed and implemented national plans of action to address seabird by-catch issues. Such initiatives have thus resulted in the development of close ties between CCAMLR and ACAP (Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels).
    20. Compliance with CCAMLR seabird by-catch mitigation measures has improved to the extent that incidental catch levels in regulated fisheries in the Convention Area are extremely low. However, the levels attributable to IUU fishing remain a cause for concern. In addition, many bird species breeding in the Convention Area (particularly albatrosses and petrels) remain affected by high levels of mortality associated with longline fishing in waters outside the CAMLR Convention Area.  
    21. CCAMLR Resolution 22/XXIII remains as an important initiative in efforts to reduce incidental mortality of CAMLR Convention Area seabirds in adjacent areas. 
    22. CCAMLR continues to exchange information with other international fisheries and conservation organizations on the prevention of fisheries-induced seabird by-catch and the state of Antarctic seabird populations, as well as its experience with mitigation and associated conservation action. In particular, CCAMLR seeks advice from other regional fisheries bodies (particularly those managing tuna, such as ICCAT, IOTC, CCSBT and WCPFC) in an effort to secure global information on incidental by-catch of seabird species breeding in the Convention Area. It should be noted that, unlike CCAMLR, many of these organizations do not mandate the collection of by-catch data, including seabird by-catch.
    23. CCAMLR also monitors the by-catch of marine mammals in both trawl and longline fisheries and remains concerned with the need to monitor fish by-catch in directed fisheries, particularly in respect of improving current knowledge and setting ecologically sustainable catch limits for the species being impacted. Various CCAMLR CMs have been agreed to address such concerns (please refer to the Schedule of CCAMLR Conservation Measures 2007/08 at http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cm/07-08/toc.htm). 
Protected Areas (Including Marine Protected [MPAS])
    24. CCAMLR has endorsed the administrative procedures introduced by the CCAMLR Secretariat in 2007 to ensure that ATCM proposals for protected areas with marine components are speedily reviewed by CCAMLR following ATCM Decision 9 (2005). 
    25. Following its Workshop on Marine Protected Areas in August 2006, CCAMLR has recognized the need for extensive dialogue with key elements of the Treaty System (CEP and the ATCM) as well as SCAR, SCOR and other inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations. In that regard: 
    • A CCAMLR Bioregionalisation Workshop was held in Belgium in August 2007 to develop a representative network of MPAs;
    • The CEP Chair actively cooperated with CCAMLR in preparing for this Workshop, and
    • Various examples have illustrated the development, designation and management of local MPAs within the CCAMLR Area, particularly in respect of MPAs proclaimed by Australia, France and South Africa.
    26. The Workshop’s outcomes require further work by CCAMLR’s Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM). Such work includes:
    • Primary regionalisation of the pelagic environment can be regarded as useful for application by CCAMLR and the CEP; 
    • Initial regionalisation for the benthic environment should be reviewed and optimized for use by CCAMLR and the CEP;
    •  Future refinement of the benthic bioregionalisation is possible in the future as methods improve and further data are acquired and analyzed.
    • Additional finer-scale bioregionalisation work can be undertaken in a number of areas using existing data; 
    • Future work could include efforts to delineate fine-scale provinces to address fine-scale regionalisation, including use of statistical methods and other potential data sources;
    • Inclusion of process and species information should be considered further in the context of systematic conservation planning, and in developing a spatial decision-making framework, and
    • A procedure should be established to identify marine areas for protection and to further CCAMLR conservation objectives.
CCAMLR Performance Review
    27. Since 1996, CCAMLR has had a standing item on its agenda to deal with implementing the Convention’s objectives. A major development in this regard was a symposium, co-sponsored by Australia and Chile, in 2005 to discuss CCAMLR’s future. A number of general and specific initiatives were proposed with a view to improving CCAMLR’s effectiveness and operational efficiency.
    28. Consequently, and following developments at COFI-27 and in UNGA Resolution 61/105, CCAMLR-XXVI agreed to undertake a review of the institution’s performance in 2008. The terms of reference, workplan and performance criteria to be examined by this review are attached at Appendix 2.  
Co-Operation with Non-Contracting Parties
    29. In implementing its Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS), CCAMLR has done much to work with various Non-Contracting Parties (NCPs) considered to have an interest in CCAMLR’s work or in the resources that it manages. Such encouragement has included inviting NCPs to attend and participate in CCAMLR meetings. CCAMLR is also actively engaged in improving dialogue with NCPs address their potential involvement in IUU fishing undermining its CMs. This achieved through CCAMLR’s Policy to Enhance Cooperation between CCAMLR and Non-Contracting Parties aimed at improving the effectiveness of CCAMLR-NCP cooperation, including a cooperation enhancement program.	  
Co-Operation with Other International Organizations
    30. CCAMLR continues to urge its Members to accept and ratify a number of relevant international agreements. It also co-operates closely with various RFMOs (CCSBT, IATTC, ICCAT, IOTC, IWC, NAFO, NEAFC, SEAFO and WCPFC) to further its work and co-ordinate its conservation efforts (particularly in relation to combating both IUU fishing and seabird by-catch during longlining). It also encourages all its Members to cooperate in developing a comprehensive and integrated international approach to such problems.
    31. FAO is one of several international organizations explicitly referred to in CAMLR Convention Article XXIII as an organization with which CCAMLR should cooperate.  Both the Commission and Scientific Committee enjoy a productive cooperative working relationship with FAO in general and with several FAO-sponsored activities such as the work of the Coordinating Working Party on Fisheries Statistics (CWP), the Sub-Committee on Fish Trade, the Regional Fisheries Bodies Secretariat Network and the  Fisheries Resources Monitoring System (FIRMS) in particular. 
    32. The Twenty-Seventh Meeting of COFI (COFI-27) took place in March 2007. It addressed a number of topics of interest to CCAMLR, particularly in terms of growing international interest for a review of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs)(see paragraph 28 above). At this stage, CCAMLR stands alone as the leading example of global best practice in addressing marine fisheries conservation issues. 
Co-Operation with the ATCM
    33. Once again, CCAMLR-XXVI expressed satisfaction with the growing co-operation between CCAMLR and the ATCM/CEP	
    34. In particular, it noted a number of points from ATCM-XXIX as being directly relevant to its work. These included:
    • ATCM Resolution 2 (2007) on southern giant petrel conservation and the need for CCAMLR Members to provide relevant data to SCAR;
    • ATCM Resolution 3 (2007) on long-term monitoring and sustained environmental observation in Antarctica;
    • CEP support for Conservation Measure 26-01 (General Environmental Protection During Fishing);
    • A CCAMLR information session for CEP-11 to report on CCAMLR’s experience in setting-up and implementing its ecosystem monitoring programme (CEMP);
    • ATCM deliberations on IUU fishing in the CCAMLR Area;
    • Supporting a proposal that the CCAMLR Science Officer periodically accompany the Chair of the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to the CEP in order to improve institutional continuity between the CEP and CCAMLR;
    • Possible inclusion of “climate change” as an agenda item, or subitem, on the Commission and Scientific Committee agendas in a manner similar to that of the CEP, and 
    • Presence of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat Executive Secretary at CCAMLR-XXVI.
    35. Following the points highlighted in paragraph 34 above, it should be noted that the possibility of a joint CEP-CCAMLR Scientific Committee meeting in 2009 was also mooted at CCAMLR-XXVI.
    36. CCAMLR-XXVI saw that the award of the prestigious 2007 WWF Duke of Edinburgh Conservation Medal to the CCAMLR Executive Secretary at Buckingham Palace on 17 October 2007 as recognising both CCAMLR’s many notable achievements and the Executive Secretary’s long-standing involvement with the Commission’s work. For such an acknowledgement to have been made during the IPY was doubly meaningful.

CCAMLR Decision to Undertake a Performance Review of the Organisation
The Commission for the Conservation of the Antarctic Living Marine Resources (CCAMLR), 
Recalling Article II of the CAMLR Convention which states that the objective of the Convention is the conservation of the Antarctic marine living resources and that, for the purpose of the Convention, the term ‘conservation’ includes rational use, 
Also recalling Article V of the CAMLR Convention, which highlights the special obligations and responsibilities of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties for the protection and preservation of the environment of the Antarctic Treaty Area, 
Further recalling that any harvesting and associated activities in the CAMLR Convention Area are to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and with principles of conservation as set forth in the Convention, 
Noting the discussions held at the CCAMLR Symposium in Valdivia, Chile, from 5 to 8 April 2005, 
Considering the recent calls of the international community to organisations with management and conservation responsibilities with respect to fisheries and marine living resources to strengthen their efforts to attain their objectives and to implement adequate approaches to fisheries management, 
Further considering the 2006 UN General Assembly Resolution 61/105 calling for Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and arrangements with management and conservation responsibilities on fisheries and marine living resources, to undertake urgently a Performance Review,
