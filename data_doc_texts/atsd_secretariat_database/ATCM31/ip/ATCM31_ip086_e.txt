Antarctica Tour Operators 2007-2008
Under Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty




Report of the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators 2007-2008
Under Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty

Introduction

The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities to ATCM XXXI (Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting) in Kyiv from June 2-13, 2008, in relation to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty.

IAATO is a member organization founded by seven companies in 1991 to advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic. 

During the 2007-2008 fiscal year, IAATO has had 108 Members. Appendix C to this report lists our 2007-2008 members and registered members for 2008-2009. A Membership Directory, regularly updated, can be found on line at www.iaato.org.

As an organization, IAATO provides an online and central office resource for all its members. Comprehensive operational guidelines and procedures are stored in a members-only section of the website for use and downloading. Regular updates and information are shared with members throughout the year. The aim is to encourage the highest possible operating standards for IAATO companies by providing them with the information needed for a safe and environmentally responsible operation.

Despite two vessel incidents (MV Explorer, MV Fram) in the 2007–2008 Antarctic season, and the increase in tourists, numbers of vessels and aircraft operations, the day-to-day operations ran smoothly. IAATO Members continued to support established practices that have proved to be effective and assures long term protection to the areas visited.  Cooperation amongst vessel captains, officers, and expedition leaders was again impressive and pivotal to the season’s success.

IAATO continues to focus its activities in several key areas. The following is a brief synopsis of organizational activities:

    1. Seasonal Instructions: The “Seasonal Instructions” to operators provide a comprehensive resource of materials and guidelines adopted by both IAATO members and numerous ATCM’s. In addition to the Instructions which are amended annually, additional updates are circulated to all operators throughout the season. The documents are mainly held in the “Members Only” section of the IAATO website. These IAATO-wide operational procedures effectively serve to manage Antarctic tourism. 

    2. Ship Scheduler: Additional computer programming enhancements were performed on the web-based IAATO Ship Scheduler program. This Ship Scheduler program allows for the pre-scheduling of  visits to sites prior to the season, not only ensuring the presence of not more than one ship at one site at one time, but also implementing the requirements laid out under the  45 IAATO Site Guidelines and the 14 ATCM Site Guidelines. In addition to noting each vessels day to day schedule, the Ship Scheduler also stores a named contact for each voyage (the expedition leader) and departure dates and ports.  Non-IAATO operators’ schedules were also included where information was provided. 

The Ship Scheduler online input closes prior to the season and a hard copy of the master schedule is then issued as a preplanning tool. Once the Antarctic operating season begins the vessels coordinate their landings in the field. IAATO members have coordinated their schedules consistently since 1991 and the online program has worked successfully for four years. 

Access to the Ship Scheduler during the 2007-2008 season was also made available to COMNAP and national programs that interact with IAATO on a regular basis with respect to station visits. The master schedule was circulated to numerous Antarctic Treaty Parties, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, IHO/HCA, COMNAP and others at the beginning of the Antarctic season. This enabled ease in scheduling, transport of scientists, and coordination of logistics and contingency planning. 

The Ship Scheduler allows for an effective exchange of information between operators, coordinated station visits in advance, ship itineraries, and compliance with requirements under adopted Site Guidelines. It also assists the IAATO Secretariat and IAATO members in their pre-planning to address potential cumulative environmental impact issues and site usage at the various landing sites. 

The tool has proven to work extremely well: even being used as a multiyear preplanning tool for arrival and departure in port cities such as Ushuaia, Argentina, in order to spread out visits in port in order to avoid crowding.

Some adjustments to the Ship Scheduler have been made for the 2008-2009 season, with IAATO members inputting their schedules in July 2008.

    3. Vessel and Company Database: IAATO’s Vessel Database is a comprehensive web-based data program that keeps detailed information on all member-operated vessels and the companies who operate them. Each IAATO member is responsible for uploading all detailed vessel and company information. The primary reason for creating this on-line program is for effective management of the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan and to maintain a database on company and vessel specifications. For example, a contact information sheet for all vessels is generated through the database each season.  Components of this database and contingency plan were tabled at ATCM XXIX IP 29 IAATO Vessel Emergency Contingency Plan-An Update (2006).

    4. Post Visit Report Database: The computerized IAATO program for loading Post Visit Report Forms (PVRs) into a single electronic database provides a detailed record of activities coordinated by IAATO since the electronic database began in 2003. In addition, tourism statistics, compiled by the US National Science Foundation-dating back to 1989 can be found on the IAATO website at www.iaato.org.  Each PVR is closely inspected before the data are downloaded in order to detect any potential errors. Successful programming efforts were made so that the forms reject incorrect data. The occasional, minor duplication that has occurred in past years has been corrected to avoid future discrepancies. The database has the capability to compile all company, visitor, vessel, and activity information as a means of tracking IAATO Members’ activities. IAATO has posted over 60 different data reports per season on tourism statistics on its website as a matter of interest to the general public. The 2007-2008 data is estimated to be available in August 2008.

    5. Post Visit Report Form Update: Minor improvements were made to the standard PVR prior to the start of the 2007-2008 season to account for the new site guidelines, clarification of activities and simpler input for operators. The PVR that had been formerly updated for the third time and approved at ATCM XXVIII Resolution 6 (2005) Antarctic Post Visit Report Form is still used. 

Endorsing the adoption of ATCM XXVIII Resolution 6 (2005) noted above, IAATO welcomes submission of non-IAATO member Post Visit Report Forms for inclusion in the database. Updated versions are sent annually to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in October, distributed amongst Parties who issue permits or authorization to tour operators that are outside IAATO and posted on the open pages of www.iaato.org, under “Operational Procedures.”

    6. Site Guidelines and Staff Interviews: Six additional site guidelines were coordinated and written in conjunction with several Antarctic Treaty Parties. Interviews by IAATO personnel were conducted at the beginning of the season with field staff operating in the Antarctic Peninsula to assess the effectiveness of ATCM-endorsed Site Guidelines as well as the IAATO Site Guidelines and other operational questions. 

    7. Observer Report Forms: IAATO developed and implemented a new form for IAATO observers on cruise only vessels and updated its IAATO Observer Report form for all other vessel use.

    8. Safety and Conservation Briefing: IAATO updated its PowerPoint presentation – “Safety and Conservation Briefing.” This is a PowerPoint presentation based on Recommendation XVIII-1 and is mandatory for all passengers and crew landing in Antarctica. A Quicktime slide show version of this can be found on iaato@iaato.org under Guidelines. In addition a specially adapted version for cruise only operations is under development.

    9. Introduced Species-“Aliens”: Operational procedures were updated to continue to support all methods necessary to eliminate the potential spreading of Antarctic diseases and translocation of non-native species. Several IAATO operators supported the “Aliens in Antarctica” program and assisted in the transport of the equipment needed to conduct this International Polar Year (IPY) study.

    10. Discovery of High Mortality Events: IAATO updated its internal procedures for members regarding a potential discovery of high mortality events in both the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Islands.

    11. Station Visits: IAATO continued to closely pre-coordinate schedules for station visits and landings with the United States Antarctic Program (Palmer, McMurdo and South Pole Stations), British Antarctic Survey (Rothera, Halley and Signy Stations) and Port Lockroy. 

    12. Science News Sheet: During the IPY, IAATO will be providing its field staff with information on various research projects which could be of interest to both tourists and field personnel. The Science News Sheets provide a dedicated channel for this information and aims to support the IPY, promoting relations between the scientific and tourist community. The two “Science News Sheets” currently published can be found on the IAATO website, three more are planned for the 2008-09 season (in October, December and February). IAATO welcomes input from National Programs in order to provide education and outreach to tourists travelling to Antarctica and the general public who visit IAATO’s website. 

    13. Education and Outreach and Posters: IAATO produced 4 large format size posters for its vessels and member company offices as educational tools entitled: Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines (1&2), 
    • Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic http://www.iaato.org/docs/Visitor_Guidelines-1.pdf 
    • Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines (Parts 1&2) http://www.iaato.org/wildlife.html
        ◦ IAATO updated the Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines during the 2007-08 season, receiving endorsement of the guidelines from the United Kingdom Sea Mammal Research Unit.  The Guidelines have been redesigned into a booklet form, which can also separate into two parts for poster use. 
    • IAATO Boot and Clothing Decontamination Guidelines for Small Boat Operations 
http://www.iaato.org/docs/Boot_Washing07.pdf

    14. Yacht Package: The one-off Yacht Package which includes comprehensive operating information for non IAATO operators was further improved. One private operator purchased the package during the 2007-2008 season.

    15. Emergency Response: Continued use was made of the IAATO Member Emergency Medical Evacuation Response (EMER) action plan. Eight IAATO medevacs were required during the 2007-2008 season. 

    16. IAATO Exchange of Information: Coordination with all new members in their start-up operations was provided and support offered to companies who have employed new staff within their home offices and in the field.

    17. Accreditation: Work on the proposed IAATO Accreditation Scheme was continued throughout the year. Different options, including ISO certification and incorporation into the ISM process for vessels are being investigated by IAATO’s Accreditation Committee, as alternatives to an IAATO based accreditation process. 

    18. Staff Training and Certification Scheme: IAATO’s Field Staff Training and Certification Scheme have seen further progress. A Field Operations Manual is being developed for the 2008-2009 season. This manual will form the course material. In addition a field staff training and on-line assessment program is being developed and will be piloted during the 2008-2009 season.  

    1 IAATO Membership and Activities 

1.1	IAATO Member offices are located in 15 countries and include: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories, and the United States.  A Membership Directory can be found on the IAATO website at www.iaato.org. IAATO’s fiscal year is from July 1 to June 30 of the next year, which is also consistent with the Antarctic operating season.

1.2 	Membership Changes and Levels during the 2007-2008 Season

IAATO experienced a 30 % increase in membership from July 1, 2007 to May 2, 2008.  The actual number of Member companies increased from 83 to 108.  Three companies have withdrawn their membership for 2008-2009 (2 are no longer in business and one is not operating in Antarctica) although 3 new companies have submitted an application for consideration to join.

The breakdown of the 101 IAATO companies that were members from July 1-March 30, 2008 (during the Antarctic operating season) includes the following categories: 

Full Members:  38 Full Members companies. These included one land-based operator, ship operators, companies that charter ships and/or organize groups to Antarctica and companies that reserve space from other ship operators. 

Provisional Members: 13 Provisional Members included ship operators, small vessel/yacht operators, and companies that charter vessels from existing Members.

Associate Members: 50 Members associated with Antarctic tourism in various forms.

Further elaboration of these categories, levels of membership and names of each of the companies can be found in section 1.3 of this paper and in Appendix C.

1.3      Membership Categories 

During the 2007-2008 period (July1, 2007 - March 30, 2008) IAATO Members were grouped into each of the following categories:

    1. Organizers of expedition ships that carry less than 200 passengers or small sailing vessels that carry less than 12 passengers. The limit of 100 passengers ashore at one site at one time applies.  (37 Members)
    2. Organizers of vessels carrying 200-500 passengers who are making passenger landings. Stringent restrictions on landing activities of time and place apply. The limit of 100 passengers on shore at one site at one time also applies. (6 Members)
    3. Organizers of cruise ships making no landings (cruise only). Cruise ships carrying more than 500 passengers are not permitted to make any landings. (6 Members)
    4. Organizers of land-based operations. (1 Member)

*Note: Full, Provisional, and Probational status occurred within categories 1-7.

1.4	Bylaws Changes: During the 2007-2008 season, IAATO operated essentially under two sets of Bylaws: New Bylaws had been agreed at the Annual Meeting in 2007 in Hobart, Tasmania, but did not become effective until April 28, 2008. A short summary of the changes within the IAATO Bylaws is referenced below. IAATO Bylaws and Objectives can be found on line at www.iaato.org under ‘About IAATO.’ The latest update is April 29, 2008. See Appendix C for a list of members and their various categories of membership.

	The most notable changes are as follows: 
    • Full Members are now referred to as “Members.” Members are experienced organizers that operate travel programs to the Antarctic, have been an Associate Member for at least one year and have fulfilled the Bylaw requirements in Article III, Sections B and C, and Article X, as applicable. Only “Members” have voting privileges.
    •  Associate Members are defined as one of the following:	
    1. Organizers that operate travel programs to Antarctica and are requesting Member status in IAATO. Once the conditions in Article III, Sections B and C, and Article X of the IAATO Bylaws are met, as applicable, these organizers can apply to become Members. (B1)
    2. Tour operators, travel agents or organizers that do not operate Antarctic tour programs themselves, but book into other Members’ programs. (B2)
    • Affiliate Members are companies, organizations or individuals with an interest in supporting Antarctic tourism and the IAATO objectives. 
    • Provisional and Probational Members are no longer levels of membership or categories within IAATO. However companies can be put on “probation” if necessary. 
    • Companies are eligible to apply throughout the year and the restriction on applications annually and quarterly has been removed.
    • For additional information, see www.iaato.org- About IAATO and click under Bylaws or Join IAATO. IAATO is in the process of reorganizing the website to take into account the amendments in the Bylaws. We appreciate your understanding through the transitional period. 

    2 2007-2008 Statistics

   2.1		Overview of Tourist Numbers
IAATO endeavors to include all tourist numbers from both IAATO operators and non-IAATO operators where the information is readily available and verifiable. From October 2007 to April 2008, estimated numbers of different types of tourism have been determined as follows;
    • 31,941 passengers/tourists landed in the Antarctic on 50 commercially organized expedition vessels (IAATO and non IAATO),
    • 257 passengers/tourists participated in an air/cruise program, 
    • 438 air/land-based tourists flew, skied, climbed, camped or participated in multi-day or overnight trips to Antarctica,
    • 13,015 passengers/tourists traveled on 7 cruise only/ large vessels (IAATO and non IAATO),
    •  613 passengers/tourists participated in air over-flights to Antarctica,
    • *13 Sailing or Motor Yachts operated outside of IAATO,
    • *3 air/land-based companies operated outside of IAATO. 

 A total of 70 vessels ranging in size from 6 passengers to 2500 passengers operated in the Antarctic during the 2007-2008 season.

* To date IAATO has received little or no information and no Post Visit Report Forms on the activities from these operators.

For detailed information and an overview of the Antarctic tourism industry see the ATCM XXXI IP 85 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2007-2008 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for the 2008-2009 Season.
	
3 	Participation in Organized Meetings during 2007-2008 and IAATO 18th and 19th Annual Meeting
IAATO members participated in several internal IAATO and external international meetings, liaised with National Antarctic Programs, government agencies of the sub-Antarctic island groups, and scientific and environmental organizations.

3.1	IAATO Annual Meetings

Since ATCM XXX (2007), IAATO has held 2 annual meetings. 
      
3.1.1 IAATO held its 18th Annual Meeting at the CCAMLR Secretariat office in
	Hobart, Tasmania, June 25-29, 2007. IAATO appreciated the participation of 134 people including IAATO Members, governments, observers and expert groups to the ATCM and non-governmental organizations. The following governments, organizations and others were represented at the meeting: Antarctic Institute of Uruguay, Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency-Germany), Australian Antarctic Division, United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Antarctic Survey, United Kingdom Overseas Territory, United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust, New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, Royal Australian Hydrography, Quarantine Tasmania, Macquarie-Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife, South Georgia Heritage Trust, Tourism Tasmania, International Polar Year (IPY) organizers, Birdlife International, COMNAP, CCAMLR, and ACAP. 

Notable action points from this meeting included discussions on membership growth, the future of tourism and IAATO, marine related issues, staff training, participation by members in IPY projects such as CAML and Aliens in Antarctica, IAATO’s Wilderness Etiquette Policy, IAATO Recommendation on Outboard Engine Use, and Waste Management Policy (See Appendix D).  IAATO’s 2007 adopted waste management policy exceeds MARPOL requirements.

3.1.2 IAATO held its 19thth Annual Meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay, April 28-May 2, 2008.   More than 110 participants came from IAATO companies, plus a number of Government representatives from Germany, Peru, and Uruguay. Additional participants came from the Port of Ushuaia, Argentina and the United Kingdom. The focus of this meeting was to address IAATO’s internal requirements given its notable membership growth during the 2007-2008 season, the changes in IAATO Bylaws, restructuring proposals, marine issues, accreditation, and site guidelines. The agenda for this meeting is on the IAATO website. 

Typically at each of IAATO’s annual meetings, the topics discussed include internal structure of the organization, membership applications, yearly operating procedures, seasonal incidents, and site guidelines, among other timely subjects. Policies are agreed and or developed or revisited, and obligations set forth by the Antarctic Treaty System are addressed and how they may affect IAATO operators. Information can be found on www.iaato.org under Information Papers. 

3.1.3 IAATO’s 20th Annual Meeting is tentatively proposed for mid-late June, 2009 in Torino, Italy. Interested parties that would like to attend or participate should contact IAATO at iaato@iaato.org.

        3.2 IAATO sent a representative to the COMNAP XIX Meeting in Washington D.C. 2007. IAATO appreciates the opportunity to work cooperatively with COMNAP where mutual interests lie in both air and ship operations. IAATO supports further cooperation between operators to ensure there is little or no disruption to science or station activities.

        3.3 IAATO was pleased to send a participant to the International Hydrographic Organization/Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica (IHO/HCA) Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2007. IAATO strongly supports and encourages the work of the HCA. Safety and navigation are extremely important concerns to vessel operators and the productive work by this group is invaluable for all ship operators. This is the 5th year where IAATO has sent a representative to this meeting and appreciates the cooperative working relationship with the HCA.

        3.4 SCAR’s Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) meeting in Germany in October 2007 was attended by an IAATO representative. IAATO appreciates the interaction with SCAR and the invitation to join meetings of such importance.

        3.5 IAATO was pleased to participate in the meeting organized by the United Kingdom at Wilton Park, United Kingdom in October 2007. Meetings of this nature are extremely valuable and enable interesting and creative discussions on current issues on tourism. 

        3.6 IAATO organized a 2-day meeting for IAATO Marine Operators, held in Los Angeles, California (February 4-5, 2008), to review the implications and lessons to be learned from the maritime incidents that occurred during the last two seasons. Twenty-one participants attended, including IAATO members and invited experts. See ATCM XXXI IP 81 Summary Report and Outcomes of IAATO’s Marine Committee Meeting on Vessel Operations and Safety for the conclusions and action points. 

        3.7 IAATO sent a representative to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Design and Equipment Subcommittee 51st meeting in February 2008 in Bonn, Germany. IAATO participated as a member of the Cruise Lines International Organization (CLIA) delegation. 

        3.8 IAATO hosted a 3-day Meeting on the Future of Antarctic Tourism in Miami, Florida, March 17-19, 2008.   Thirty-nine participants attended, including nine governments, IAATO members, ASOC and invited experts. See ATCM XXXI IP 19 Chairman’s Report from the Miami Meeting (March 17-19, 2008) on Antarctic Tourism.

        3.9 Numerous other meetings took place between IAATO Members, IAATO Committees and their representative governments throughout the year.   IAATO continues to maintain a policy of availability for discussions on topics of tourism with Treaty Parties and others.

4	Field Coordination
4.1	IAATO compiles seasonal documents including vessel call data, a comprehensive ship scheduler, emergency contact information, expedition leader schedules, and important instructional procedures for responsible operations. In addition there are over 150 files hosted on the IAATO website per season providing Members with appropriate guidelines and standard operating procedures in a single, easily accessible database. 

4.2	IAATO’s comprehensive directory of Vessel Call Data and the Master Ship Schedules are shared with COMNAP and other government offices to encourage improved communication and operational coordination. COMNAP’s MINIATOM is an extremely useful tool for tour operators trying to contact stations or government vessels. As IAATO vessels transport numerous scientists and support personnel to Antarctica each year, in addition to requesting tourist visits to stations, it is helpful when station contact information is up-to-date for communication, planning and emergency purposes. 

4.3	Expedition leaders and ship's officers on Member vessels circulate advance day-to-day itineraries and maintain regular contact throughout the season to coordinate site visits and exchange general information such as ice conditions, weather, landing recommendations, and note concerns about potential environmental impacts, etc. At 1930 hrs local time expedition staff monitors agreed-radio frequencies to change itineraries if needed or report on ice conditions, weather or wildlife sensitivities. This constant cooperation and coordination between members is a key part of the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan. 
	
4.4	Details on IAATO’s Emergency Medical Evacuation Response plan (EMER) have been presented at previous ATCM’s. IAATO has had an effective plan in place since 1998.

5	Environmental Impact Assessment and Advance Notification
5.1	All IAATO members are required to submit either Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA’s), Advance Notification and or operational documents that substitute for EIA’s to their national authorities pending each countries legal processes. Not all governments require EIA’s or yearly updates. IAATO is aware of operators this year that have neither submitted Environmental Impact Assessments, nor filed Advance Notification or Post Visit Reports. 

5.2	A comparison of the various EIA’s and the level of EIA’s that individual operators are required to submit to their respective governments reflect some notable inconsistencies amongst documents and requirements. IAATO, however, endeavors to bridge gaps in documentation for ship-based Members, in particular to ensure there are mitigation measures and procedures in place to avoid environmental impacts. 

5.3	As noted in all previous reports to the ATCM’s, IAATO remains concerned about non-IAATO operator activities. The Association urges Contracting Parties to ensure that obligations of the Environmental Protocol are being met, Environmental Impact Assessments are being submitted, and detailed mitigation measures are included. IAATO is concerned that once the paperwork process is completed by non-IAATO operators to their respective governments (if at all), there is no supervision of management or follow-up to ensure that non-IAATO operators are following the requirements of activities specified by the Treaty Parties.

5.4	In the Environmental Impact Assessments of some non-IAATO operators, it is noticed that IAATO’s documents are frequently referenced. IAATO encourages Parties to contact IAATO for verification when these occasions occur. It is not possible for non-IAATO operators to adhere to IAATO’s Bylaws or have the breadth or understanding of the numerous operating strategies that IAATO has developed over the years. This is a service that IAATO provides for its member’s operations.

6	Procedures to Prevent the Introduction of Alien Organisms
6.1	For the past 8 seasons, IAATO’s Boot and Clothing Decontamination Recommended Guidelines and Translocation of Diseases Protocol have been in place and have proven to be effective. 

7	Reporting of Tourism and Non-governmental Activities and Data Base
7.1	As noted previously in this paper, IAATO requires its Members to submit the ATCM’s approved Post Visit Reports on conclusion of their activities.

7.2	IAATO continues to support the use of this single form, which reduces the burden of paperwork and facilitates the study of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourist activities. IAATO would like to encourage Parties to send IAATO a copy of any forms received from non-IAATO operators in order for the data to be incorporated into IAATO’s “Overview of Tourism” and the IAATO tourism database. This will provide for greater transparency of all tourist activities and will further the ability to address cumulative impact issues. IAATO’s database will be able to access information from these forms and analyze, if necessary, statistics on site use and visitation.   IAATO would welcome information on the16+ non-IAATO operators who worked in Antarctica in the 2007-2008 season.

8	Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1 (Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic and Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic) and Other Guidelines
	Recommendation XVIII-1, “Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic”, is provided to all Members in order to inform them of key obligations and procedures to be followed. 
	
	IAATO urges Parties to consider formally adopting Recommendation XVIII-1 for both Visitors and Tour Organizers. 

        8.1 IAATO is very concerned about tourists traveling on non-IAATO-operated vessels visiting the Antarctic who may not be aware of the Environmental Protocol and its obligations. As tourism increases, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula region, every visitor and operator will need to be responsible for even greater care of the landing sites and the marine environment. 

        8.2 IAATO’s standard operating procedures for implementing Recommendation XVIII-1 include the following: 
    • Mandatory briefings on each tour ship prior to arrival in the Antarctic, a presentation consisting of the IAATO PowerPoint presentation. This presentation can be viewed on line at www.iaato.org under Guidance for Visitors on the home page. Most expedition leaders will enhance the presentation with additional slides and commentary. 
    • Passengers, ships’ command, crew and expedition staff receives paper copies of Recommendation XVIII-1 Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic. Some companies distribute this document in pre-season materials in advance of departure, some on board the ship. In addition to receiving copies of the Recommendation, all passengers and ship’s personnel (crew) are required to attend the briefing. 
    • Guidelines are available on the open pages on the IAATO website in English, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish. 

        8.3 In addition, IAATO Members continue to use IAATO and/or company adopted guidelines which include: marine wildlife watching, site specific information, assessment checklist for visiting ‘new’ sites, kayak, mountain climbing, camping, scuba, helicopter, Zodiac, Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV), and boot and clothing decontamination and more. See ATCM XXXI IP83 Regulation of Antarctic Tourism—A Marine Perspective.

9	Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning
9.1	At IAATO’s 18th General Meeting (Hobart, 2007) the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan was reviewed. No changes were made, as the plan still proved to be effective during the 2007-2008 season. Following the incident involving the MS Explorer the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan is undergoing a further assessment and review. 

9.2	The IAATO EMER plan has been in place for at least the past eleven seasons in order to reduce the need to impact scientific stations in the Antarctic Peninsula with tourism-related medical problems. A standard medical information checklist is available for Members and new Members in order to ensure adequate medical supplies are available on board vessels.

9.3  	Marine Incidents 2007-2008: Following the incident involving MV Fram and loss of the M/S Explorer, IAATO is committed to ensuring that effective lessons can be learned from these incidents which will serve to enhance safety for all vessels operating in Antarctic waters. IAATO welcomes the synopsis produced by the Republic of Liberia, Bureau of Maritime Affairs which provides information on issues being considered under the investigation. IAATO notes that this synopsis addressed to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is not a preliminary report, nor does it bind the Liberian Administration to a final report. Additional information regarding the events surrounding both the loss of MS Explorer and the incident involving MV Fram can be found on www.iaato.org

With respect to the loss of MS Explorer, and understanding that consideration of many issues will need to be deferred until after the final report from the Republic of Liberia, Bureau of Maritime Affairs has been completed, IAATO has confined its discussions of the incident to issues related to the IAATO-wide response and consideration of potential enhancements to current management practices. It is recognized that while the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan worked exceptionally well, there are always important lessons which can be learned from any such event. To this end, a meeting of IAATO marine operators took place in February, 2008 to discuss the IAATO response to the M/S Explorer incident and other issues related to vessel operations and safety. The report and outcome for this meeting are detailed in ATCM XXXI IP081 Summary Report and Outcomes of IAATO’s Marine Committee Meeting on Vessel Operations, Safety and Related Issues which summarizes the immediate steps which have been taken and the longer term steps which are under consideration. In addition to these deliberations, IAATO’s Marine Committee will be analyzing in detail the final investigation report from the Liberian Administration, once completed, with the intention of assessing any further steps which may be taken to enhance vessel safety.
 
10	Scientific and Information Support 
	Members continue to provide logistic and scientific support to National Antarctic Programs and to the sub-Antarctic Islands facilities providing a cost-effective resource for the scientific community. During the 2007-2008 season, scientists, support personnel and equipment for various National Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Programs were provided transport to and from stations, field sites and gateway ports. A partial list of scientific support is included as Appendix B. 

	Specific requests for logistic or other support can be made directly with Members or via the IAATO Secretariat. For a complete Membership directory, please refer to the IAATO web site at www.iaato.org.

11	Conservation Research, Academic and Scientific Support
Members and their passengers continued the tradition of direct financial contributions to many organizations active in Antarctica. Appendix A provides a partial list of donations received thus far, but updates continue to be received.

12	Observers On Board Member Vessels 
IAATO requires Provisional and Probational Members to carry an observer before they are eligible to apply for Full Membership. During the 2007-2008 season IAATO appointed 4 observers to sail on Provisional Member-operated vessels. There were no Probational Members during the past season. IAATO considers using a qualified National Program observer from the country in which the company is registered. When not available, IAATO will appoint an appropriate person with broad experience in Antarctic and/or related matters. IAATO had updated the “Checklist for Observers” form (version October 2007) for use last season.  In addition, ATCM XIX Resolution 5 (1995), Antarctic Treaty Inspection Checklists, is also provided to the appointed observer. IAATO-operated vessels have been carrying observers since 1991. IAATO believes that checklists provide consistency with regard to reporting procedures and that the checklists are also important in that the operator knows what is being inspected. 

13	With Thanks -- Cooperation with National Programs, the Antarctic Treaty Parties and all Stakeholders
IAATO appreciates the opportunity to work cooperatively with Antarctic Treaty Parties, COMNAP, SCAR, CCAMLR, IHO/HCA, ASOC and others towards the long term protection of Antarctica. In particular we appreciate being able to contribute towards the ATCM agreed ICG’s, other intersessional meetings etc.

The following provided assistance and operational guidelines to IAATO during the 2007-2008 season for which Members are grateful: 

    • To all Stations in the Antarctic and Sub Antarctic who welcomed tourists and broadened their views on the value of science and provided friendly, educational and rewarding experiences for tourists. 
    • United Kingdom: United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Antarctic Survey, U.K. Antarctic Heritage Trust, Port Lockroy staff, sub-Antarctic Islands' personnel and others for making visits an extremely educational and enjoyable experience and for providing Members with comprehensive guidelines for visits to BAS stations and their process for arranging visit applications.
    • Chile and Russia: For the use of the runway at Marsh/Frei for medical emergencies in conjunction with Aerovias DAP and to Bellingshausen Station for accommodation and taking last minute requests during medevacs. 
    • United States: Palmer, McMurdo and South Pole Station personnel for hosting organized visits throughout the season and providing operational guidelines to operators in advance of the season
    • Chile, Russia, and Uruguay, United Kingdom (HMS Endurance): for assisting by air, land and sea with regard to the Explorer incident.

				       Membership List

The following is a list of IAATO Members during the 2007-2008 season and upcoming 2008-2009 season as of May 2, 2008. If a vessel is operating both in 2007-2008 and in 2008-2009 it is not noted. Notations are only made if it is either one year or the other. Due to changes in IAATO Bylaws the levels of membership have been noted for both operating seasons.

*Note below that Abercrombie and Kent operated the vessel Explorer II. During specific departures the named changed to either Minerva or Alexander Von Humboldt. It is the same vessel with different names all organized under Abercrombie and Kent’s operation. During 2008-2009 the vessel will operate as Minerva.

In addition the Fram, Nordnorge and Saga Ruby occasionally carried less than 200 passengers on some departures. See ATCM XXXI IP 85 Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2007-2008 Antarctic season and the Preliminary Estimates for 2008-09 Antarctic Season for additional information.

Appendix D
Partial list of Agreements from IAATO’s 18th Annual Meeting, 
Hobart, Tasmania, 2007

    1.  IAATO Statement on Waste Management

The meeting discussed waste management practices in marine areas adjacent to the area of the Antarctic Treaty and agreed that:

    1. For IAATO Member operated vessels, the restrictions on discharge into the sea from vessels that apply in the Antarctic Treaty area, pursuant to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and MARPOL 73/78, should be extended northward to apply everywhere south of the Antarctic Convergence (Polar Front);
    2. the location of the Antarctic Convergence shall normally be deemed to be the line defining the northern limit of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) set forth in Article I, paragraph 4 of the Convention (see coordinates below) , unless measurement of variation in sea water temperature clearly establishes its location as further north;
    3. with the long term objective of preventing any discharge of waste by IAATO Member operated vessels on Antarctic voyages, all such vessels capable of doing so are strongly urged to retain all waste on board for appropriate shore-side disposal; and
    4. IAATO open lines of communication with the appropriate authorities in gateway ports aimed at promoting expansion of environmentally sound waste reception facilities.

Coordinates
  The Antarctic Convergence shall be deemed to be a line joining the following points along parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude:
50°S, 0°;  50°S, 30°E;  45°S, 30°E;  45°S, 80°E;  55°S, 80°E;  55°S°, 150°E;  60°S, 150°E;  60°S, 50°W;  50°S, 50°W;  50°S, 0°.

2. IAATO Recommendation on Outboard Engine Use

In order to help preserve the quality of the environment, IAATO recommends that tour operators using spark ignited marine outboard engines in Antarctica comply with California emission standards, star label 3 and above. 

See website: http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/offroad/cert/cert.php

Engines meeting this standard should be phased in over a three-year period as older engines need replacement.

3. Agreed General Statements 
    1. To relieve pressure on heavily visited sites, where practicable, operators should be encouraged to minimize direct reference to specific landing sites (e.g. Deception Island) in marketing material.
    2. Members are discouraged from digging swimming holes along the shores of Port Foster, Deception Island. If doing so then holes should only be dug in the littoral zone, and filled in immediately afterwards. 
    3. IAATO encourages its Members to start to consider their carbon footprint with a view to measuring carbon footprint and to look for ways to reduce our emissions.
