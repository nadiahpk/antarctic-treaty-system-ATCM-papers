Legislative and regulatory mechanism

The legislative and regulatory mechanism (Law n°2003-347 of 15 April 2003 and Decree n°2005-403 of 29 April 2005), as established by Book VII of the Code on the Environment (articles L.  711-1 to L.  713-9 and R.  712-1 to R.  714-2), marks the completion of France’s implementation of the Madrid Protocol relating to Antarctic Environmental Protection and its five annexes.  

In pursuance of R.712-3 of the Environmental Code, the decree of 23 May 2006 (Journal official de la République française, n° 128 of 3 June 2006, p.  8452) sets forth a list of activities subjected solely to advance declaration under meaning II of Article L.  712-1 and of Article R.  712-3 of the Environmental Code, provided they have an impact on the environment that is less than minor or transitory.  

    • Annex V to the Madrid Protocol

Law n° 2005-501 of 19 May 2005 (Journal Officiel de la République française n°116 of 20 May 2005, p.8732) authorizes approval of Annex V to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty relating to area protection and area management, the adaptation into law of which was ensured, in part, by the aforementioned legislative provisions.  

This annex was published in the Journal Officiel de la République Française by Decree n° 2005-1075 of 23 August 2005 (J.O.R.F.  n°203 of 1 September 2005, p.14163).  Book VII (regulations) of the Environment Code stipulates, under Article R.  714-1, the modalities for designating specially protected areas and specially managed areas in Antarctica.

    • Annex VI to the Madrid Protocol

The parliamentary procedure for adopting the bill ratifying Annex VI of the Madrid Protocol on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies, adopted at the 28th Meeting of the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, is under way.

Moreover, France has proceeded with initiating the approval procedure for some of the Measures relating to the protection of some areas taken in consideration by previous Meetings of the States Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.

    • The Polar Environment Committee

The Polar Environment Committee (Comité de l’Environnement Polaire, or C.E.P), created by Decree n° 93-740 of 29 March 1993, amended by Decree n° 2002-497 of 9 April 2002 (J.O.R.F.  of 12 April 2002) is placed under the responsibility of the Minister in charge of the environment.  It is made up of a chairperson and ten other persons having a four-year term, renewable once, and selected for their scientific and technological knowledge of environmental issues.  It is responsible for verifying the compatibility of human activities under the jurisdiction of French authorities in the polar and sub-Antarctic areas with environmental preservation.  

The C.E.P.  shall be consulted concerning the designation of Antarctic specially protected areas and specially managed areas as set forth in Annex V of the Madrid Protocol.  It shall also be consulted on activity programmes, major projects, and impact studies involving all human activity in the polar and sub-Antarctic areas.  In these areas it shall ensure regular and continual surveillance of human activities; contingency plans and inspection reports shall be referred thereto.  The committee may also be consulted on all issues relating to the polar environment.  It may, on its own initiative, examine all issues that fall under its jurisdiction.  Finally, it may carry out studies and surveys, and make any proposals or recommendation that it deems necessary.  

Moreover, on the occasion of the creation of the National Nature Reserve of the Southern Lands (Decree n° 2006-1211 of 3 October 2006 making provision for the Nature Reserve of the French Southern Lands, JORF, n°230 of 4 October 2006, p.  14673), the C.E.P.  was designated as the scientific committee for the reserve.  As such, the C.E.P.  shall render its opinion on the management plan for the reserve that the senior administration for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) prepares.  In 2008, it will also give its opinion on the “biodiversity” action plan which this same administration shall finalise.  

The next C.E.P.  meeting is set for 19 June 2008.


(2) Number and type of permits delivered (Annex II, Article 6.2 of the Protocol) during the 2004-2007 period

 Article 6 Exchange of Information (…)
2.  Each Party shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee before the end of November of each year of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1 above and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 1st July to 30th June.


The decree of 14 August 1998 sets forth measures for protecting birds present around the Dumont d’Urville base.  At all times, the following is forbidden:  the destruction or removal of eggs or nests, the destruction, mutilation, capture, naturalization of birds of non-domestic species or, whether living or dead, their transport, peddling, sales or purchase.  These protective measures were taken pursuant to the opinion of the Polar Environment Committee (CEP).

For the 2007-2008 season, seven requests to authorize the capture/collection of protected species nesting in Adelie Land were presented to the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.  They had to do with long-term monitoring studies and occasional research, involving banding, bird monitoring, blood sample collection, and attaching transponders.

One request concerning the placement of transponders on 300 emperor penguin chicks was turned down, given the large scale of the programme and the relatively low stability of the emperor penguin population at Dumont d’Urville (about 3000 reproducing couples per year, a number unchanged since the late 1970s).  As for the other requests, authorizations to carry out experiments were granted by permission from the National Council for the Protection of Nature (ministry in charge of the environment).  

The individuals affected were 340 Adelie penguins, 16 emperor penguins, 100 snow petrels, 51 Weddell seals, and 100 Antarctic skuas.

These permits were granted to the IPEV (Institut Polaire Français Paul-Emile Victor) for the scientific programmes it supports.  

Since October 2002, and as was initially provided for by the environment law code, the authorizations to capture and release species subject to Title I of Book II of the Rural Code relating to the protection of nature are delivered by the senior administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF).  

 (3) Waste disposal and waste management pursuant to Annex III of the Protocol

France has reaffirmed the prohibition against the exportation of waste in the Antarctic Treaty area by introducing into its internal legal system the Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (together with 6 annexes) done at Basel on 22 March 1989 and published in the JORF by Decree no°92-883 of 27 August 1992.  

The amendments to the annex to the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention of 1973 for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships designating the Antarctic area as a special area pursuant to the MARPOL Convention were published by Decree n° 97-610 of 31 May 1997.


(4) Inventory of activities pursuant to Annex II, Article 8 (3) of the protocol (Annex III, Article 9(1))

Article 8 Waste management planning
3.  Each such Party shall, as far as is practicable, also prepare an inventory of locations of past activities (such as traverses, fuel depots, field bases, crashed aircraft) before the information is lost, so that such locations can be taken into account in planning future scientific programs (such as snow chemistry, pollutants in lichens or ice core drilling).

Article 9 Circulation and review of waste management plans
 1.  The waste management plans prepared in accordance with Article 8, reports on their implementation, and the inventories referred to in Article 8 (3), shall be included in the annual exchanges of information in accordance with articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and related Recommendations under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.

All waste produced in Adelie Land, with the exception of grey water and black water, shall be removed.  The management program undertaken by the Institut Polaire Français Paul Emile Victor involves a reduction of the volume of waste to be treated, notably for combustible solid waste and incombustible solid waste, the training of expedition members, and the development of simple treatment procedures.  The fuels used at Dumont d’Urville are, depending on their type and use, transported and stored in drums or tanks.  Since February 1992, the importation of waste into Australia is subject to a permit delivered by the federal Ministry of the Environment.  The waste is collected at the source, following specific standards.

At Dome C, the very design of the French-Italian Concordia station provides for consideration of waste management, notably waste water, going beyond mere compliance with the regulations set forth by the Madrid Protocol.  For this purpose, an agreement was made between, on the one hand, the two construction organizations (the IPEV on the French side, and the PNRA – Programma Nazionale di Recerche in Antartide – on the Italian side) and, on the other hand, the European Space Agency (ESA), so as to develop a grey-water treatment system, as a precursor to onboard recycling facilities on manned spacecraft.  This system has been operational since 2005.  For example, during the 2007-2008 summer season, 145,000 litres of water were consumed, of which 94,000 litres were recycled, yielding a mean treatment system efficiency performance of about 65%.  

The tables, below, summarize the waste volume and weight that were repatriated from Dumont D'Urville to Australia for the 2007-2008 season (for some types of waste, for which treatment or storage may take place by special agreement in this country) or to France (for the other types of waste).

(5) Number and type of permits covered under Annex V during the 2007-2008 season 

For the 2007-2008 season, five authorizations granting access to the protected areas of Adelie Land that are part of ASPA 120, in the Geology Point archipelago, were issued by the Senior Administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.  

These authorizations were granted to the IPEV for two scientific programmes.
These programmes involved:
- monitoring the spatio-temporal variation of the environment and the ecology of marine birds and mammals;
- the energy strategy of marine predators (plunge-diver birds) and the physical and nutritional variability of the southern ocean; land-based studies.
