Annual report pursuant to Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty 
1. Notification pursuant to Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
1.1. The legislation
Ukraine ratified the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty with Law No 2284-III of 2001. Next followed Decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on "Implementation of  Ukraine international obligations on ratification of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty” and “The Procedure of issuing of permits for activity of Ukraine physical and juridical personnel in Antarctica”. Publication of these legislative acts contributed greatly to the strengthening of Madrid Protocol provisions in Ukrainian legislation. 
According to these documents, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine is state organization responsible for effective application of the Environmental Protocol. The documents contain information about obligatory conditions of permit issuing for the planned logistic or scientific activity, terms of consideration, the control of the activity that is carried out and adoption of sanctions in cases of non-compliance with the permit.
The Commission for the permission issue for physical and juridical Ukraine personnel activity in the Antarctic region was created (04.03.2004, № 176). The Commission responsibilities are to review by the requested Antarctic activity and to resume for the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine about character and level of possible environmental impact.
Nowadays the Ukraine according to the Protocol is implementing the Annex VI rules on legislative and practical level in Ukrainian law. The Law of Ukraine “On the Antarctic Activity” should be the final document with respect to all Ukrainian legal initiatives. The project of the Law was passed by the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) in the Second Reading and is now assigned to further revision. The Law defines general principles of Antarctic activity within Ukrainian jurisdiction to guarantee the scientific, environmental, domestic and normative activity in compliance with the Treaty (Article IX).

1.2. Contingency plans in accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol
The contingency plans of activity in the emergency situations, which were recommended by Article 15 of the Protocol, are prepared. Activity of personnel in emergency situations at the Ukrainian Antarctic Station Vernadsky is regulated by the documents: Instructions for the station personnel operation under principles of fuel transfer from ships and acting in the case of its leakage, Instructions for the personnel operation in fire emergency. 
2. Annex I of the Protocol
In accordance with Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty the activity of Ukraine in Antarctica is subject to rigorous environmental impact assessment procedures.
