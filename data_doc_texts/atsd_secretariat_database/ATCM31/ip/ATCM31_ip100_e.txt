The international collaboration in rescue action for evacuation of Bulgarian polar explorer from Antarctica

During construction works on the Bulgarian Antarctic Base "St. Kliment Ohridski" on the Livingston Island the base commander got a serious contusion on his back. He was transported to the neighbor Spanish base "Juan Carlos I" on the board of Spanish “Zodiak”. The medical doctor of the station decided that an immediate evacuation is needed. The closest hospital is situated on the King George Island, 120 km away from the Bulgarian base. 
Thanks to the Spanish crew and the Brazilian vessel “Almirante Ary Rongel” an immediate connection with the Chilean icebreaker “Almirante Viel” in the South Shetland Islands area was established. 
The wounded Bulgarian was transported to the hospital on King George Island with a Chilean helicopter “Bell”, who flied from the “Almirante Viel” during strong wind and cloudy weather.
After medical examination it was decided that the Bulgarian has to be transported to hospital which has the appropriate specialized installations and stuff. The closest one is situated 1000 km away in Punta Arenas. 
The Spanish Polar Institute for marine technologies (CSIC) in Barcelona provided a transport with a commercial flight of the Chilean air company DAP. The wounded was transported to Punta Arenas where his health state was stabilized. Few days later the Bulgarian returned in his country.
The happy end of this accident is an example for the excellent coordination and cooperation in the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty between the nations, which have polar bases in the South Shetland Islands area, in extreme conditions and situations.
