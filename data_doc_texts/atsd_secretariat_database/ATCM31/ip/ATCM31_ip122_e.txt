Monitoring of Human Impacts at McMurdo Station, Antarctica




Monitoring of Human Impacts at McMurdo Station, Antarctica
Introduction
Human impacts at McMurdo Station have been monitored by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) for many years.  In the past, most studies were directed at specific impact issues such as construction projects, site remediation, environmental impact assessments, and fuel spills.  In response to national and Antarctic Treaty obligations to monitor the impact of science and logistical operations in Antarctica, the USAP began a “pilot” monitoring effort coordinated within a programmatic framework in 1999.  This pilot program has since informed the establishment of the USAP’s long-term monitoring program, initiated in 2004.  The design of the long-term monitoring program takes into account the recommendations of a series of international SCAR/COMNAP workshops, best monitoring practices from temperate climates, a synthesis of historical information, and the results of the pilot program.  
This paper summarizes the design elements of the long-term monitoring program, initial results of the program, and lesson learned from monitoring human disturbances at McMurdo Station. 
Monitoring Goals and Objectives
Generally speaking, the goal of a monitoring program is to observe and quantify impacts to an area in order to provide guidance for management decisions.  A monitoring program must be capable of accurately describing both the spatial and temporal variations (i.e.: the “status” and “trends”) in the area’s environmental conditions.  Explicit management objectives are essential for guiding the design of a monitoring program that effectively provides feedback to the decision-making process.
The management objectives for the USAP long-term environmental monitoring program are four-fold:
    1. Establish the aerial extent of disturbance zones associated with McMurdo Station (i.e., a station “footprint”) and determine whether the aerial extent and intensity of the impacted area is increasing, decreasing, or remaining the same with time.
    2. Assess whether the aerial extent and intensity of heavily impacted areas are increasing, decreasing, or remaining the same with time.
    3. Determine which indicators most accurately detect impacts that can be linked to specific activities that are subject to management. 
    4. Ensure U.S. obligations to the Antarctic Treaty are met and recommend revisions of the monitoring program design in consideration of the results from objectives (1) to (3).
Preliminary Monitoring through the Pilot Program
Historical information about local impacts and data collected throughout the pilot program were used to develop an initial monitoring program design that would later inform the long-term McMurdo monitoring program.  The set of variables measured during the pilot program included three categories of indicators: physical (surface disturbance, grain size, carbon content), chemical (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), metals, and hydrocarbons) and biological (benthic community structure).  More than 2000 samples were collected and analyzed during the pilot program, providing data for a statistical assessment of the future long-term monitoring program’s design elements.  
The results of the pilot program indicate that impacts at McMurdo Station can be characterized as on-shore and offshore physical disturbance, terrestrial and marine soil/sediment chemical contamination, and altered marine benthic communities.  Further conclusions follow.  
    • Land-based physical disturbance, quantified from aerial photography, is restricted to the few square-kilometer confines of the Station.  This surface disturbance was established early in the station’s history and further activities resulting in physical disturbance are mostly confined to areas already disturbed.  Thus, the footprint of physical disturbance has been stable for several decades.
    • At most locations, contamination of surficial soils at McMurdo Station is minimal.  However, there are legacies of contamination from historic operational practices and in certain areas, on-going activities pose a risk of continuing contamination (for example, the potential for spills during fueling operations).  The spatial distribution of contaminated surficial soils at McMurdo Station is patchy with areas of 10’s to 100’s of square meters and impacted areas are localized with little evidence of redistribution away from the origin. 
    • One of the more impacted areas of McMurdo Station is the contaminated sediments of Winter Quarters Bay.  Marine benthic sediments are contaminated with a complex mixture of PCBs, polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs), hydrocarbons, and metals.  Most contaminants in and near Winter Quarters Bay are restricted to within a few hundred meters of the shoreline adjacent to McMurdo Station.  Marine benthic communities have responded in predictable ways to organic enrichment and contamination by toxic chemicals.
    • The conclusions of the pilot program indicated that overall disturbance at McMurdo Station is of low intensity compared to other similar human-occupied sites worldwide. With the exception of Winter Quarters Bay sediments, the levels of many of the soil contaminants at the station were within two standard deviations of the levels at nearby control sites and can therefore be considered background levels.
Long-Term Monitoring Program Design  
The datasets produced by the pilot program were statistically analyzed to determine the grid-size, spacing, and number of samples needed per area to accurately describe patterns and changes to the Station area.  These design parameters are site- and impact-specific and must be determined for each individual disturbance scenario and location.  Statistical analyses indicated that undisturbed off-station locations should be used as reference sites.
Other recommendations based on the pilot program include:
    • The annual monitoring of core indicators of impact (outlined above as physical, chemical, and biological) should be continued in the long-term monitoring program until sufficient temporal data has been collected to determine the optimum frequency of sampling.
    • Sampling of the terrestrial environment should be part of the long-term monitoring program. The optimum frequency of sampling should be investigated through time-series sampling.
    • Marine contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, metals), organic enrichment (Total Organic Carbon (TOC)), toxicity (Microtox), and benthic biological indicators should be measured as part of the long-term monitoring program. The optimum frequency of sampling should be investigated through time-series sampling.
    • Biological tissues should be screened for contaminants to assess whether contaminants are entering the local food web.
    • The stability of the physical disturbance footprint should be reassessed on a 5-year cycle or when explicit management questions need to be addressed. 
    • Water quality measures, water toxicity testing, and yearly analysis of run-off samples should be discontinued unless there are explicit management questions to be addressed.
    • Monitoring of air quality was not recommended unless specific management questions were to be addressed.
Based on historical information and data collected during the pilot program, a design for a long-term monitoring program at McMurdo Station was proposed in 2002 and implemented from 2004 to the present.

Long-Term Monitoring
The long-term monitoring program has been in place for 4 years and, combined with data collected during the 3-year pilot program, there is a total of 7 years of coordinated, yearly observations of the McMurdo Station environs.  In addition to the conclusions that emerged from the pilot program, further conclusions from the long-term monitoring program are summarized below. 
    • Newly introduced contaminants primarily occur in areas that have historically experienced contamination as these continue to be areas of significant human activity.  Elevated levels of contamination are often ephemeral in nature, either being cleaned-up or evaporating to the atmosphere. 
    • Hydrocarbons associated with fuel are by far the largest potential contaminant by volume brought to the Station.  Within the station proper (on land), hydrocarbon contaminants are present at low levels with occasional higher levels detected in areas were activities utilizing fuel are carried out.  Hydrocarbon contamination is the most prevalent type of contamination on Station but the bulk of the surficial soils at the Station contains levels of hydrocarbons that would not be expected to elicit acute or chronic biological responses (e.g., total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations are lower than “levels of biological concern” established in temperate climates). 
    • Surficial soil contamination at McMurdo Station is stable over timeframes of a few years though there are occasional incidents that contaminate small areas of the station and locations where operations take place away from the station (e.g., runways).  
    • Marine sediments in Winter Quarters Bay are contaminated with a toxic, complex mixture of PCBs, petroleum hydrocarbons, trace metals, and debris of various types. PCBs appear to be from an unrecorded disposal of waste oil or casting wax at some time in the past.
    • Metals on the land surface are generally at or near background levels.  Occasional anomalous lead levels were detected and may be a legacy of leaded fuel use in the past or derived from other anthropogenic sources (e.g., paint, plumbing materials, solder).  However, there are few biological resources in the land-based setting, other than microbiological organisms, that are at risk for exposure to contaminants.  
    • Chemical contaminant compositions (particularly PCBs) are similar to unaltered source materials demonstrating little microbiological degradation despite, in the case of the PCBs, being released to the environment 30 or 40 years ago.  This suggests that these chemicals will persist for tens if not hundreds of year if natural processes are the only removal mechanisms. 
    • Indications are that disturbed land surfaces will not return to pre-disturbance conditions for many tens, if not hundreds, of years.  Once disturbed, land surfaces are very slow to recover in polar climates.
    • Many of the materials in Winter Quarters Bay were deposited during the 1960’s and 70’s.  The impacted area appears to be stable and is contained within a small, silled basin but further far-field sampling studies are needed to confirm this.  There is little evidence of recent contamination of marine sediments from disposal practices or from run-off from the Station.
    • Contaminants have been detected in marine benthic organisms demonstrating that toxins are being incorporated into biological tissues.  Additional screening of biological tissues and improved understanding of the local ecology will allow for a better assessment of the risk for further biological exposures in the area.
    • Years of sewage disposal enriched organic matter in sediments beneath the receiving waters at the outfall offshore of the Station.  Benthic community response to organic enrichment is confounded with responses to toxic chemicals deposited in the same general area.  Station waste is now treated before discharge and recovery of the benthic areas previously altered by disposal of untreated sewage is being monitored.
Future Directions
Long-term monitoring at McMurdo Station will continue for the foreseeable future with the same core set of physical, chemical, and biological measurements.  Directed studies can supplement these base measurements as needed.  For example, additional contaminants being considered for measurement include PCTs and tributyltin (TBT), both reported to be present in McMurdo Bay sediments but as yet not regularly measured, as well as flame retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE).  In addition, the program design will be revised to increase the density of sampling of the marine benthos and adopt marine sediment sampling methodologies that will allow access to greater water depths than provided by diver collections.  This is needed to more accurately define the spatial and temporal stability of impacted marine sediments adjacent to the Station.  Other refinements to the program are being considered.
