Finland's Antarctic Research Strategy

Information Paper
Agenda 16: exchange of information
Submitted by Finland
1. Introduction
An international expert panel evaluated Finnish Antarctic research in 2006. This evaluation was presented by Finland in ATCM XXX with an information paper (ATCM XXX IP3).
The Finnish Coordination Committee for Antarctic Research has revised Finland's Antarctic Research Strategy in 2007, particularly taking into account the recommendations of the international expert panel. This paper presents briefly the main features of the revised Finland's Antarctic Research Strategy. The strategy has been published in Finnish and in English (Reports of the Ministry of Education 2008:4). The English version of the strategy is also available from the Ministry of Education World Wide Web site http://www.minedu.fi/export/sites/default/OPM/Julkaisut/2008/liitteet/tr04.pdf?lang=fi.
2. Finland's Antarctic Research Strategy
Antarctic research will produce high quality scientific data that concern Antarctica or for which information obtained from Antarctica is irreplaceable. Research may be either literally global, or limited to the two polar regions, but which would not be possible without data from Antarctica. Moreover the research will generate information to support national and international decision-making. Finnish Antarctic research will be well coordinated with and integrated to international research community. This will require emphasis on those areas of strength in which Finland has the opportunity to promote in a significant way international scientific research as well as improve collaboration with different participants.
Finland signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1984. The Finnish research station, Aboa, was established in Queen Maud Land in 1988 and Finland was accepted as a Consultative Party in 1989. Research activities and associated administrative functions are coordinated by the Coordination Committee for Antarctic Research (CCAR), established by the Ministry of Education to represent various branches of government and research communities. It examines the Antarctic research strategy at regular intervals and updates it as appropriate.
The original background motivation for funding research was support of Finland’s joining the Antarctic Treaty. In particular, the polar regions’ changing climate conditions and their broad effects on the world have increased the significance of Antarctic research in scientific and social matters. Global change and the study of its consequences require careful study of both Poles, including both Arctic and Antarctic regions. Antarctica is a unique natural laboratory, where phenomena affecting the entire globe are studied. The high capability of Finnish research in Arctic regions forms a strong base for Antarctic research, and there are efforts to make it stronger in the future.
Vision of the state of Finland’s Antarctic research in 2015
• Finnish Antarctic research in selected areas is at a high international level, recognised as such, and open to new directions.
• At least three groups in Finland show a demonstrated capability for Antarctic research at a high international level. 
• Finnish scholars' participation in international collaboration (for instance, the SCAR programmes) is supported by long-term financing of broad, multi-disciplinary research projects.
• Researchers take advantage of both national and international funding opportunities.
• Researchers and research groups are involved in both national and international multi-disciplinary cooperation, including technological activities. 
• Interaction between Antarctic and Arctic region researchers is active.
• Finland participates actively in the work of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and plays an effective role in the planning and realisation of research projects concerning the Antarctic. 
• Research is well coordinated nationally and the national funding for research and associated logistics will be at a level suitable for quality research operations.
• Research results are published in internationally recognised journals and are communicated effectively to a wider audience. 
• Research results are made use of broadly, including national and international decision-making.
• Antarctic logistics assures that the high requirements for research on the Antarctic continent are met.
• Finland takes part in the decision making of the Antarctic Treaty System.
• Finland supports and actively develops comprehensive protection of the Antarctic region’s environment.

As the means to achieve these goals the Coordination Committee for Antarctic Research defined:
1. Selective emphasis on strong areas of research
2. Increasing research collaboration
3. Finland will maintain a research station and expedition efforts
4. Funding to be granted for larger projects
5. Greater utilisation of national and international funding possibilities
6. Finland will participate in the cooperation called for by the international Antarctic Treaty System
