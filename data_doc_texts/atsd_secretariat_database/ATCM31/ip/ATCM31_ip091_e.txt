The COMNAP Fuel Manual, incorporating revised guidelines for fuel handling and storage in Antarctica 





The COMNAP Fuel Manual, incorporating revised guidelines for fuel handling and storage in Antarctica 
Information Paper submitted by COMNAP under 
agenda item 11 “Emergency Response and Contingency Planning”

Introduction
1.  COMNAP developed between 1990 and 1993 a number of guidelines related to fuel handling and storage. Prepared for COMNAP by its Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations (SCALOP), these guidelines were designed to assist National Antarctic Programs with:
    • preventing oil spills;  
    • responding to a spill should one occur; and 
    • sharing information about spills to help determine if, and where, there was a need to modify or improve fuel handling practices. 

2.  Four main documents were produced:
    • Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning 
(CGN 01/1992 - approved by COMNAP June 1992); 
    • Recommended Procedures for Fuel Oil Transfer at Stations and Bases
(CGN 02/1992 – approved by COMNAP June 1992); 
    • Recommendations for Spill Prevention and Containment of Fuel  at Stations and Bases
(CGN 03/1992 – approved by COMNAP June 1992); 
    • Guidelines for the Reporting of Oil Spill Incidents Which Occur in Antarctica
(CGN 04/1993 – approved by COMNAP June 1993).

3.  The work on these documents included an intensive review of industry and government practice in a number of countries and of a number of recommended procedures published by the IMO and other organisations. These documents reflected best practice and were promptly circulated to, and used by, National Antarctic Programs. 
4.  The first three documents were presented to ATCM XVII (Venice, 1992) as annexes 3, 4 and 5 to the COMNAP report to ATCM XVII. The fourth document was introduced at ATCM XVIII (Kyoto, 1994) through the COMNAP report to ATCM XVIII, then formally presented to ATCM XXII and CEP I (Tromsø, 1998) in Information Paper XXII ATCM / IP062 “Guidelines for Reporting Oil Spill Incidents which Occur in Antarctica”. 
5.  COMNAP also presented in 1998 to ATCM XXII Information Paper XXII ATCM / IP006 “Emergency Contingency Planning” which recalled the existence of the first three documents and provided an analysis of the extent to which oil spill contingency plans had been put in place by operators. 
6.  That same ATCM XXII recommended in Resolution 6 (1998) “Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning”, that the Consultative Parties adopt these four documents and that COMNAP keep these under periodic review, and revise them as necessary. 
7.  The four documents underwent several routine reviews between 1998 and 2005 with no revision deemed necessary. 
8.  ATCM XXVIII (Stockholm, 2005) in Resolution 3 (2005), noting that the issue of fuel storage and handling has been raised in several reports of inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and has been noted by the CEP on a number of occasions, recommended that COMNAP consider undertaking a further assessment of fuel handling and storage facilities and procedures in Antarctica with a view to issuing a set of clear recommendations to operators.
9.  In response, COMNAP initiated a more in-depth review of the guidelines related to fuel handling and storage.
Review of the guidelines
10.  COMNAP convened a workshop on 07 November 2005 in Christchurch, New Zealand. The specific purpose of the workshop was to review the set of four separate COMNAP guidelines related to fuel handling and storage guidelines. 
11.  The workshop was attended by 12 participants representing five National Antarctic Programs, the COMNAP Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations (SCALOP), the COMNAP Working Group on Ship Operations (SHIPOPS), the COMNAP Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON), the COMNAP Secretariat and IAATO. 
12.  A brief report of the workshop was presented to ATCM XXIX and CEP IX (Edinburgh, 2006) in Information Paper 114 “COMNAP report to ATCM XXIX” (section 3.7). 
13.  Key questions discussed were 
    • whether the guidelines were still adequate; 
    • what the obstacles to their implementation may be; and 
    • how these can be overcome. 

14.  Key objectives were 
    • to ensure guidelines represented best practice; and 
    • to help National Programs, and any other operator, to comply with these guidelines.

15.  The text of the guidelines and the practices it described were found to be essentially still adequate although some wording needed adjusting to align with specific wording from the Protocol on Environmental Protection and its annexes, in particular the recent Annex VI on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies. 
16.  It was agreed that while the text of the guidelines required only relatively minor amendments there was a need to rejuvenate the guidelines with graphics, actual examples, associated brochures and posters and give them a higher profile. This would make the guidelines more accessible and hence more effective.  
From revised guidelines to a COMNAP Fuel Manual
17.  A way forward was proposed. Two important steps have now been completed:
    • Review in details the structure and wording of the set of existing guidelines in view of the perceived obstacles and make adjustments to update the text of the guidelines – this included 
    • highlighting the existence and relevant implications of Annex VI (on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies) to the Protocol on Environmental Protection, to make senior personnel more aware of their new responsibilities;
    • simplifying the language and avoiding very dry wording; and
    • clarifying the audience and re-targeting the message accordingly.
    • Bring all four guidelines and associated documents together into a single “Fuel Manual” document. 

18.  The text and new structure of this document was circulated, reviewed and finalised over 2006/2007, and the COMNAP Environmental Coordinating Group tasked to finalise and publish the new text. 
19.  This reshaped “COMNAP Fuel Manual” is provided as Appendix 1, and is available on the public section of the COMNAP web site.
20.  Future steps proposed by the workshop and under consideration include:
    • Bring graphics into the manual wherever possible including diagrams, photos, cartoons, etc...
    • Insert, link to or attach actual examples (e.g. images or documents) of good practice from operators.
    • Develop a publishing system whereby the “Fuel Manual” can be provided in a binder, with all copies managed and updated through downloading latest versions from an online version of the manual.
    • Consider future development of the manual through development of additional sections addressing topics such as:
    • field fuel management;
    • guides for internal auditing of fuel-related installations and procedures, with pro-forma reports;
    • short (anonymous) case studies on past fuel spills; and
    • characteristics (e.g. material safety data sheets) for commonly used fuels.
21.  A number of actions that will contribute to these future steps are under way. It includes for example improvement and expansion of the Spill Reporting System or the development by the COMNAP Training Officers Network (TRAINET) of an online library of training material and operating procedures, which specifically called for submission of fuel related documents used by operators.
Conclusion
22.  The guidelines for fuel storage and handling in Antarctica developed by COMNAP 1990-1993 have provided valuable guidance to Antarctic operators for a good 15 years. Review of the guidelines showed that their substance remained current and adequate. The guidelines continued to represent best practice. 
23.  Some wording was adjusted, in particular to align with specific wording from the Protocol on Environmental Protection and its annexes, and the set of four separate guidelines were reorganised in a single “COMNAP Fuel Manual” in which additional sections can be inserted as required - in particular new sections containing supporting information or links to such information, checklists or pro-formas for internal auditing of installations and procedures.
24.  This new “COMNAP Fuel Manual” is presented at Annex 1.
25.  The format and presentation of the Fuel Manual will also be progressively rejuvenated to facilitate its readability. This will include inserting diagrams, photos or cartoons wherever possible and inserting, linking to or attaching actual examples of good practice. 
26.  COMNAP will continue to develop and update the Fuel Manual and to promote and facilitate its use by all operators. The original objectives remain as current and important as they were in 1990:
    • preventing oil spills;  
    • responding to a spill should one occur; and 
    • sharing information about spills to help determine if, and where, there was a need to modify or improve fuel handling practices.

INTRODUCTION
Background
The need to develop and implement measures to alleviate and combat the pollution of Antarctic waters has been the subject of Recommendations, Resolutions and Decisions adopted at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings over more than a decade.  These include:
    • Recommendation XV-4 (1989): Human impact on the Antarctic environment. Prevention, control and response to marine pollution
    • Resolution XXVIII-3 (2005): Fuel Storage and Handling
    • Resolution XXII-6 (1998): Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning
    • Decision XXVIII-8 (2005): Use of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in Antarctica
    • Resolution XXVIII-3 (2005): Fuel Storage and Handling

The need to develop contingency plans environmental incidents is a requirement of Article 15 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  More specifically, Annex IV requires Parties to develop contingency plans for marine pollution response in the Antarctic Treaty area.  Annex VI (Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies), agreed in 2005, requires operators to establish contingency plans for environmental incidents, and 
COMNAP Guidelines for fuel spill prevention, contingency planning, response and reporting were first produced in 1992 and 1993.  More than ten years on they are no less relevant. 
Intended use of this Manual
This Manual, and the various Guidelines it incorporates, set out general standards and procedures applicable to most operations.  Managers and operational staff should work together to ensure the guidelines are being implemented.  It is intended that more specific documentation is developed by each operator for their own vessels or stations, appropriate for their facilities and personnel.  Where possible, current examples of operator-specific documents will be provided. 
CONTINGENCY PLANNING

(This section is based on a revised version of COMNAP Document CGN 01/1992 Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning first published June 1992)

1.	INTRODUCTION

    • Annex VI of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection requires operators to co-operatively establish contingency plans for responses to incidents with potential adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment or dependent and associated ecosystems.  These plans must include:
    •  (a) procedures for conducting an assessment of the nature of the incident;
    • (b) notification procedures;
    • (c) identification and mobilisation of resources;
    • (d) response plans;
    • (e) training;
    • (f) record keeping; and
    • (g) demobilisation.

    • This COMNAP document defines a recommended format and specifies the information to be included in oil spill contingency plans, which are to be prepared by operators for facilities, or for larger geographic areas in Antarctica.  The format is consistent with Annex VI requirements, but designed specifically for fuel spill contingency planning rather than environmental incidents in general.  While the format provided should be a useful basis for any plan, it should be adapted if appropriate for the particular needs of a facility or area.

2.	TIERED APPROACH TO CONTINGENCY PLANNING

    1. Most oil spills in Antarctica are likely to be small and confined to a station or base and the adjoining waters.  In the event that the spill is beyond the station or base capability, or is likely to affect a larger area, an enhanced response may be necessary involving support from other operators.
    2. This tiered response to oil spill incidents requires the development of contingency plans for individual facilities and, where appropriate, compatible contingency plans for larger geographic areas encompassing a number of operators, as defined below:

    • Facility plans
    • These are to be developed for individual stations or bases and their local environs, where appropriate.  The plans will be prepared by individual operators responsible for the management of a specific facility.

    • Multi-Operator Plans
    • These are to be developed to encompass a geographic area where a coordinated and compatible response by two or more operators is feasible.  This will apply where it is effective and feasible to pool and deploy response equipment and supplies.

3.	FORMAT OF PLANS

3.1	The recommended format for Facility and Multi-Operator contingency plans is given in the Appendix.  The plans are to be divided into two parts plus annexes as follows:

Part I: Strategic Information
This is a descriptive policy document providing background information including a description of the facility and an evaluation of oil spill scenarios.

Part II: Operational Response
This described the recommended procedures for the development of an operational response to oil spills.  The format of the Operational Plan corresponds to the expected chronological order of events.  The text of this document should be supplemented, to the maximum extent, with decision tree diagrams or checklists to simplify and speed interpretation.  In particular the Operational Plan, Chapter 6, shall be in the form of tree diagrams or checklists.
Annexes
These include detailed reference information relating to specific aspects of the contingency plans, e.g. Communications, Health and Safety, Training, etc.

        3.2 It is recommended that all operators adopt the formats specified in this document.  This will enable the plans to be easily understood and assist with the integration and compatibility of the facility plans with multi-operator plans, where applicable.  Plans should be complete in themselves and not involve reference to other supporting documents, which may cause delays.  Plans should preferably be produced in loose-leaf form to facilitate regular update.

4.	PLAN EFFECTIVENESS

        4.1 The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation consider that the adequacy of any contingency plans may be assessed against the following ten questions:
    1 Has there been a realistic assessment of the nature and size of the possible threat, and of the resources most at risk, bearing in mind the probable movement of any oil spilled? 
    2 Have priorities for protection been agreed, taking into account the viability of the various protection and clean-up options? 
    3 Has a strategy for protecting and cleaning the various areas been agreed and clearly explained? 
    4 Has the necessary organisation been outlined and the responsibilities of all those involved been clearly stated with no ‘grey areas’ - will all who have a task to perform be aware of what is expected of them? 
    5 Are the levels of equipment, materials and manpower sufficient to deal with the anticipated size of spill. If not, have back-up resources been identified and, where necessary, have mechanisms for obtaining their release and entry to the country been established? 
    6 Have temporary storage sites and final disposal routes for collected oil and debris been identified? 
    7 Are the alerting and initial evaluation procedures fully explained as well as arrangements for continual review of the progress and effectiveness of the clean-up operation? 
    8 Have the arrangements for ensuring effective communication between shore, sea and air been described? 
    9 Have all aspects of the plan been tested and nothing significant found lacking? 
    10 Is the plan compatible with plans for adjacent areas and other activities?

FUEL TRANSFER PROCEDURES

(This section is based on a revised version of COMNAP Document CGN 02/1992 Recommended Procedures for Fuel Oil Transfer at Stations and Bases first published June 1992)

1. 	INTRODUCTION

        1.1 The transfer of fuel oils from resupply vessels to shore based storage facilities, and between individual storage facilities on stations or bases, are potentially hazardous operations.  It is incumbent on operators to ensure that the procedures are in place, and are implemented, to minimise the risk of oil spillage and environmental pollution during such fuel transfer operations.

        1.2 The procedures outlined in this document cover the documentation, operation, inspection and maintenance of fuel transfer facilities and the training requirements for operational staff.  Individual operators may deem it necessary to supplement these minimum requirements to satisfy national standards, or to meet specific operational needs.

2.	PROCEDURES
Planning
        2.1 Plan all fuel resupply operations in order to minimise the handling of fuel before its use, as each transfer carries a risk of spillage.

        2.2 Identify the main point of contact at both the source (e.g. resupply vessel) and destination (e.g. station).  The identified personnel should exchange information to ensure a common understanding of operations before fuel transfer commences and maintain communications throughout the operation.  

Documentation
        2.3 Personnel who are responsible for, or are required to undertake, fuel oil transfer operations are to be provided with clear and comprehensive documentation prescribing the procedures to be followed, and precautions to be observed, in conducting fuel transfer operations.

        2.4 The documentation is to clearly identify the specific responsibilities of all personnel involved, including the individual in overall charge of the transfer operation and the points of contact noted above.

        2.5 The documentation is to include up-to-date layout drawings or diagrams indicating storage tanks, reticulation systems, pumps, valves and safety devices.

        2.6 All tanks, valves and pumps are to be allocated unique identity numbers which are to appear on the layout drawing and in a prominent place on installed equipment. The written procedures are to make reference to the identity numbers.

Training
        2.7 All personnel who are responsible for, or required to undertake, fuel oil transfer operations are to receive instruction or training in the operation of the equipment, spillage prevention and other measures.

        2.8 The above personnel will also receive training on oil spill contingency planning procedures and duties.

Operations
        2.9 Fuel transfer equipment must be inspected for serviceability prior to the commencement of pumping operations.

        2.10 Except during fuel transfer operations, all isolation valves on storage tanks are to be closed.

        2.11 When transferring fuel oil between ships and shore facilities or fuel farms and remote holding tanks (e.g. at power houses), personnel must be stationed at both locations to monitor the transfer operation and must also maintain regular contact via VHF radio or similar.  The fuel transfer pipes must be monitored for leaks during transfer operations.

        2.12 During fuel transfer operations only one tank shall be active (i.e. valve open) except at the overlap period when switching from the access tank to the next tank.  Such operations must be continuously monitored.

        2.13 All personnel responsible for, and associated with, fuel transfer operations are to take whatever action is deemed appropriate to minimise and avoid the risk of fuel spills.

        2.14 If personnel have any doubts about the adequacy of existing procedures and systems, these must be brought to the immediate attention of the responsible authority.

        2.15 Records of all fuel transfers and spillages shall be maintained by personnel on site and the national operating authority.

Inspection
        2.16 All fuel storage tanks are to be visibly inspected on a weekly basis, and as soon as possible following adverse weather, to check the integrity of the storage systems and associate plumbing.

        2.17 All storage tanks are to be checked monthly to verify contents.

        2.18 Bulk storage tanks shall be thoroughly inspected on an annual basis.  

        2.19 A record of these inspections, including the internal cleaning of tanks, shall be maintained at the station.  A logbook should be established for this purpose with the date, name of personnel and results for all maintenance and inspections of fuel handling and response equipment undertaken.

Maintenance
        2.20 All pumps, valves and associated equipment are to be maintained in good working order.

        2.21 Any defective fixtures or fittings shall be replaced or repaired as soon as is practicable.


BEST PRACTICE FOR FUEL SYSTEM DESIGN

(This section is based on a revised version of COMNAP Document CGN 03/1992 Recommendations for Spill Prevention and Containment of Fuel at Stations and Bases first published June 1992)

1.	INTRODUCTION

Fuel oils are used at Antarctic stations and bases for a variety of operational needs including power generation and the fuelling of vehicles and aircraft.  The spillage of fuel oils as a result of equipment failure, accidental damage or human error poses a potential environmental threat.  It is therefore incumbent on national Antarctic operators to design, install and operate fuel oil storage facilities to minimise such risks.
The design recommendations outlined in this document are intended to minimise the possibilities of fuel spillage to the environment.  The recommendations apply to new and, where practicable, existing installations.  The design philosophy incorporates:
    • spillage prevention;
    • spillage containment;
    • spillage detection;
    • spillage alert; and
    • spillage recovery.

2.	DESIGN RECCOMMENDATIONS

Spillage Prevention

Installations shall be sited and designed to minimise the harmful effects of the environment, such as from ice build-up on valves and fittings.
Installations shall be sited to minimise damage from operational activities such as heavy vehicular traffic and where this is not practicable the installation shall be protected by means such as bollards, guards and signs.
Tanks, valves and fittings shall be of first grade materials, suitable for petroleum products and site specific climatic conditions.
Lever operated ball valves shall preferably be used which give clear visual indication of the open and shut positions. 
Manufacture, fabrication and site construction of facilities shall be inspected, tested beyond application conditions if possible, and approved for use by a competent authority.
The installation shall avoid undue complexity so as to reduce the risk of human error through confusion or misunderstanding.
Tanks shall be piped for top fill and top draw off.
All tanks shall be numbered and have the maximum capacity clearly marked. 
All valves shall be tagged or numbered to facilitate clear and unambiguous description in operating procedures.
Adjacent tanks shall be fitted with overflow equalising connections between them, where practicable.
Tanks shall have calibrated dipsticks, continuous level monitoring gauges, or other means of assessing the quantity of fuel stored.

Fuel pumps for bulk handling shall have a lockable switch or other appropriate mechanism to prevent accidental pumping.
The delivery pump shall have an emergency stop switch or other appropriate mechanism located in a prominent, accessible position.  Alternatively, a master valve shall be fitted immediately downstream of the pump to facilitate emergency shutdown.

Spillage containment

The containment facility shall have the capacity to contain the contents of at least the largest tank, should a spill occur, plus an allowance of at least 10% for snow, ice or water accumulation. 
    • Containment may take various forms including, for example:
    • Bunding around the installation or around individual tanks;
    • Remote bunding with interconnecting drainage from tank installation
    • Double skin tanks, horizontal or vertical, with the outer skin being the containment; or
    • Flexible bladders within containment structure.

Spillage alert

    • Audible and/or visual alarms shall be installed in locations which are frequented regularly, or are obvious during fuel transfer operations.
    • All bulk fuel storage shall, where practicable, have a high level alarm which is audible and/or visible to an operator.  Such alarms shall signify a potential overflow before the tank reaches capacity.

Spillage Recovery

    • Installations shall have the capacity to store any recovered fuel up to quantities at least matching the capacity of the largest tank.  This provision may be met by additional storage capacity such as a spare tank or by under-filling tanks to provide the reserve storage by transfer pumping.
    • See section Contingency Planning for further information.
REPORTING SPILLS

(This section is based on a revised version of COMNAP Document CGN 04/1993 Guidelines for the Reporting of Oil Spill Incidents which Occur in Antarctica first published June 1993)

1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1	The intention for reporting of spills to COMNAP is to provide an archival record of oil spill incidents which occur in the Antarctic Treaty area, in order to assist operators to determine whether there is a need to modify or improve oil handling practices.  Spill reporting is part of a wider incident reporting system operated through COMNAP.

2.	OIL SPILL REPORTING PROCEDURE

        2.1 In the event of an oil spill incident in excess of 200 litres (and for spills less than 200 litres, if considered significant or of use to other operators), operators are to lodge a COMNAP Oil Spill Report with the COMNAP Secretariat. (IAATO members submit should submit their reports to IAATO, which will provide coordinated reporting to COMNAP).

        2.2 The report is to be provided in English.

        2.3 The report is to be lodged with the COMNAP Secretariat within 30 days of the incident occurring.  

        2.4 Any further information regarding investigation of the incident and any follow up actions should be lodged with the COMNAP Secretariat within 90 days of the incident occurring.  There is no set format for this, instead copies of appropriate spill investigation reports or other documentation should be provided to the COMNAP secretariat.  This will allow the sharing of key lessons with other operators.

        2.5 In the event of a major spill, a copy of any press release or publicly released statement on the incident should be provided to COMNAP members through the COMNAP Secretariat.

        2.6 In addition to reporting of spills, Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty requires annual reporting on contingency plans.  This reporting is part of the annual exchange of information which should be lodged with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat before 1 October each year. 

3.	REPORTING FORMAT

    • The format and content of the COMNAP Oil Spill Report, which is to be lodged with the COMNAP Secretariat, is given at the end of this section.  A description of the information to be provided is described against each heading. 
    • Reports should be lodged electronically by email to <sec@comnap.aq>.

4.	OIL SPILL SITREP
4.1	To facilitate the collection of information in a format which will assist in the compilation of the COMNAP Oil Spill Report, a suggested situation report (SITREP) format is given in Annex B.  It should be noted that the SITREP is intended for the internal use of operators only, and is not to be lodged with the COMNAP Secretariat.
4.2	Operators are encouraged to use some form of root cause analysis in the course of their internal reporting and follow up.  This involves identifying the range of influences and events which led to the spill, in order to put measures in place to avoid a recurrence.  Relevant questions are included in the SITREP form.
