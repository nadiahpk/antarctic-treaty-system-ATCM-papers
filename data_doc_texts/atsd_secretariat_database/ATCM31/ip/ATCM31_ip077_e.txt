Additional Information on draft CEE on proposed new Chinese Dome A Station in Antarctica
1. Introduction
China circulated a note respectively during the 30th ATCM meeting and 10th CEP meeting that it would set up a new station at Dome A, Antarctica. Formally approved by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Oceanic Administration of China, CAA put on the web of its Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (draft CEE) regarding the setting up of the station at Dome A and this draft CEE was circulated to all CEP members through the contact point mail list of the CEP. The draft CEE has now been presented to CEP as WP-5 and IP-4. China appreciates the Chairman of CEP for the timely circulation of the CEE to all members and the establishment of the intercessional open-ended contact group and our appreciation also goes to the ATCM secretariat for putting the CEE on the web and the translation of the Non-technical Summery into other languages used by ATCM. Again our appreciation also goes to Mr. Ewan Mclvor from Australia for the effective work he has done as a convener of the intercessional open-ended contact group.  
2. Response to Comments/Suggestions
China welcomes and highly values the comments and suggestions on the draft CEE received from related countries and organizations and believes that these comments and suggestions will play an important role in improving the construction of the Station and the final CEE,as well as the environmental protection measures. The improving work has been going on continuously after the submission of the draft CEE, and special effort has been made on the security of the expedition members, environmental protection, energy saving, scientific study and logistic services in order to better the preparation work. These improvements integrate with the comments and suggestions received, and will be shown in the final CEE, which will be circulated according to the requirements of the Protocol. 
The appendix of this information paper is the basic response to the comments and suggestions put forward by the related countries and organizations. For easy reading and better understanding, we have classified the issues raised and it is our willingness to explore and exchange views with all the countries and organizations on this matter for the purpose of the better preparation for the proposed activity and perfecting the final CEE.

Appendix: Basic response to the comments and suggestions raised during ICG discussions.

Scientific Programs
    • Ice core drilling:
★Section 1.3.1 states the proposed Dome A station will serve as a base to support important deep ice core drilling activities, but the possible impacts of such activities are not addressed in Section 5. As the impact of borehole drilling fluids can be considerable, the final CEE could describe the intended type and quantities of such fluid that will be used, mitigation measures to be applied, and an assessment of likely impacts. Alternatively, the drilling activities might be subject to a separate environmental impact assessment.（Australia）
★Initiation of a deep ice core drilling appears as a major justification of the project. Several mentions to the technical aspects of this scientific project are present in the draft CEE, especially through the map of the site (Fig. 17 p. 49) and in the Table 5 (p. 47-48) providing details of the construction. If the start of this activity were planed in the same time than the construction of the station (summers 2008-09 and 2009-10), it would be necessary to include considerations on the potential impact of such ice core drilling on the environment. This information is required especially because the deep ice core drilling implies the use of drilling fluids. An alternative would be to submit a specific CEE for this activity.(France)
    • Gambustsev Sub-glacier Mountains: 
★Similarly, details on this geological project and how the sampling will be done are needed in order to estimate its impact on the environment. As for the ice core drilling, a possible option is to submit a separate IEE or CEE ‘depending on the expected impacts.(France)
★The geology of the subglacial Gamburtsev Mountains being one of the scientific objectives, we wonder how this can be reconciled with the limitation of station activities to a radius of 80 km (page 11).（Belgium）
    • The draft CEE addresses the environmental impacts arising from the construction and operation of a summer station for 15-20 people. However, these impacts have been considered in isolation from the suite of activities that the station has been constructed to support over the next 25 years. Some of these activities, such as the retrieval of the deepest ice-core in Antarctica to date, exploration and drilling into the Gamburtsev Mountains and the expansion into a year-round station of 25 people are potentially activities of long duration with significant environmental impacts. As explained under section 3.1.1 of the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (P. 6), it is insufficient to prepare separate EIAs for each activity since taken in its entirety; the ensemble of activities has potential for impacts of much greater significance. Hence, “when activities are to be undertaken at sites which are visited repeatedly by one or more operators the cumulative effects of past, current and planned activities should be taken into consideration.” As the station is built for these activities, they need to be included in the CEE and taken into consideration when assessing the cumulative impacts arising from the presence and operation of the station. Of course, details of some of these activities may not be fully available at this stage. However, since the construction of a station is part of a long-term, strategic research plan, sufficient information must be available on the activities that the station is built for and can be used as best available knowledge. （ASOC）
    • Page 21, Section 1.3, describes potential science activities that may take place in and around the Dome A station.  While we agree that the CEE should include information about the type of science the Station intends to support, we also think it should be clearly stated that the CEE is for the construction and operation of the Station, and does not cover proposed science activities being supported by the Station.  These activities should be subject to separate EIA, the level of which will be determined by the potential impacts of each activity. Clearly the cumulative impacts of the various activities should be addressed within the separate EIA. It is also not clear what has already been cached or installed at the Dome A site or under which level of EIA these activities have been conducted. (New Zealand）
    • As a general comment about the planed science projects, we recommend that all necessary precautions will be taken in order to avoid duplication in scientific activities, especially in some fields which are already covered in other inland stations like South Pole, Vostok, Concordia or Dome Fuji, and to focus on the projects which are based on the specific characteristics of Dome A.(France)

    • Ice core drilling:The original intention was to conduct ice core drilling in the year of 2011 after the completion of the construction of the Station, and the environmental evaluation would be conducted separately. Since ice core drilling is one of the main purpose of the Station, and the operation and storage place for the activity will be built at the same time with construction of the station, in addition, the plan for ice core drilling has finished, thus the details of the plan, the environmental evaluation and mitigation measures will be added to the final CEE.    

    • Gambustsev Sub-glacier Mountains:The geology of the sub glacial Gamburtsev is a joint international program, which will focus on the subglacia Gamburtsev Mountains with limitation of 100 km or mainly within 80 km. The program will be carried out after 2011;some facts and the environmental evaluation will be added in the final CEE. As the program is still at the planning stage, whether or not it needs a separate EIAs will be decided according to the actual facts during later stage. 

    • Other scientific activities: The main scientific activities at the Station will be the ice core drilling and the study of astronomy etc. which will be further addressed in the final CEE.  

    • Avoiding duplication in scientific activities: It is true that the duplication of scientific activities should be avoided. China had held some workshops on the feasibility study on the setting up of the new station. The workshops came to the opinion that as the Dome A is at the highest location, it has the irreplaceable scientific value. The construction and operation of the Station there will contribute a lot to the study of climate change, geological structure, astronomy and environmental monitoring. 
ASMA No. 6 Larsemann Hills，East Antarctica
    • The environmental aspects of activities at the site of the proposed Dome A station are described and addressed throughout the draft CEE. However, as mentioned in the document, the construction and resupply of the station will occur via Zhongshan station in the Larsemann Hills. This arrangement will naturally result in an increase in activity in the Larsemann Hills, including an increase in personnel, equipment and supplies being transported through the area on route to the ice plateau and Dome A. The Larsemann Hills is designated as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) but there is no mention of the ASMA in the draft CEE, including in Section 4.7. The CEE should, as a minimum, state that the proposed activities will be conducted in accordance with the agreed ASMA Management Plan. In particular, it would be useful for Section 5.12 of the final CEE to describe in greater detail what measures will be implemented to minimize the risks of introducing non-native species with cargo and equipment to be offloaded in and transported through the area.(Australia)
    • Chapter 5, Identification of the Environmental Impacts and Preventive and Mitigation Measures does not include a detailed analysis of impacts on Larsemann Hills Antarctic Special Protected Area,  ASMA No. 6 (Measure 2, ATCM 2007) where the materials and cargo to build the Dome A Station will be  managed and prepared for a trip of 1200 Km. inland. The authors should also consider that this operation will be necessary every year to keep the Dome A Station working.（Ecuador）
    • The logistic activities at Zhongshan Station and their possible environmental impacts should be examined to be in accordance with the Management Plan of ASMA No. 6, Larsemann Hills. This relates to cumulative impacts due to other activities within the ASMA No. 6 such as the construction of the new Indian station.（Germany）
    • the draft CEE states p. 81 that “in the area where the Station is proposed to be built by China, there is neither Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA), nor Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), nor Historical sites or Monuments”. It is true but because the Zhongshan Station becomes an essential component of the Dome A Station (gateway to the site, increase in logistical activity at this site, treatment of some wastes produced at Dome A…), there will likely be several consequences on the coastal station which is located in the ASMA No 6, Larsemann Hills. So, it is needed to take these consequences into account and to examine how the Zhongshan Station’s part of the Dome A project is in agreement with the Management Plan of the ASMA 6 adopted by the ATCM XXX at New-Delhi.(France) 
    • Page 81 (Section 4.7) states that there are no ASPA and ASMA at the location. The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2005), suggest that the location of the activity be described with regard to areas with special management requirements. It is noted that the success of the activity relies on the support and transportation of equipment, fuel etc through Zhongshan Station which lies within ASMA 6.  We believe this should be mentioned within the draft CEE.（New Zealand）
    • Are there particular measures in place to ensure that the Larsemann Hills ASMA will not be negatively impacted by increased activity at Zhongshan Station?(US)
    • The cargo and fuel as well as the expeditioners to Dome A will stay about 10 days at Zhongshan Station. The draft CEE mentioned about the environmental impact and some mitigation measures and these aspects will be further addressed in the final CEE, to ensure that the regulations of the Larsemann Hills Antarctic Specially Managed Area be fully followed. 
Construction
    • The description of the construction materials to be used should be somewhat more specific so as to ensure that no material banned under the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty will be utilized.（Germany）
    • Scientific buildings: whereas there is no doubt that this project is driven by science, the total area of the buildings dedicated to scientific activities (other than the ice core drilling project) is rather small (1 container of 18 m² mentioned in Table 5 p.48). Is there any project of extension of the station in a short term period to allow the development of scientific projects?(France)
    • Figure 18 – There is no indication of a bathroom area within the Station layout. Page 68 (Section 2.6.2) – A table showing the Station construction timetable with contingencies built into it, would be helpful.（New Zealand）
    • 2.5.7 Emergency Facilities:Pg 64，Table 10: Several components of the emergency facilities (accommodation, life vests, and tents) will not be sufficient for the 20-25 people that may be present at the station at the time of an emergency.  “Accommodation” and “life vests” are both for 15 people and “tents” as listed will hold 16 people. Pg 117:1st paragraph: This statement comes in conflict with Table 10 on Pg 64:“The short-term objective is to satisfy15-20 persons for summering, and the long-term objective is to satisfy the optimum use by 25 persons as a year-round station.  However, its daily facilities… as well as contingency- or shelter- required places are designed to accommodate more people.” Emergency and shelter facilities cannot accommodate more than 15 people according to Table 10 on Pg 64.（US）
    • Table 5 – It is not clear which activities some of the season’s deadlines correlate to, e.g. logistic (emergency), has two seasons listed, but it is not clear which season corresponds to the different activities.(New Zealand)
    • Mode, materials and installation of buildings: Pg 52, Fig 19: Are the units for the container dimensions in centimeters? (US)
    • 2.5.6 Electric system: Pg 59: How will power be transferred to the station?  Will cables be buried in the snow?  If so, what would be the environmental impact of buried cables in Section 5? (US)
    • 2.7 Accommodation and related Facilities: Pg 68 and 69: So far, only the specifics for the construction phase are mentioned here.  Are there additional specifics that can be mentioned for accommodations and related facilities during regular operations after construction is complete?(US)
    • Building materials: In the drat CEE it mentioned that the environment friendly, durable, fire proof and low temperature resistant materials except for those banned by the Protocol would be used. At present, the main materials have been selected, the material for the out wall of the construction is neutral phenolphthalein froth metal laminboard and inside thermal layer will be rock wool material. Other details will be addressed in the final CEE.  
    • Construction for science activities: In addition to the container which is 18 m2 in size for scientific observation in table 5, there is special section which is 50 m2 in size in the main construction of 283 m2 indicated in item (5) of the Fig.18. 
    • The main construction: The toilet is in section 8, but without specific indication in Fig 18. The emergency and shelter facilities(contingencies) are listed in the logistic items. 
    • Emergency shelter facilities: The emergency accommodation can hold 15 people and the vehicles for transportation can hold 20 people in case it needed. The 15 life vests are for the first summer season and another 15 life vests will be brought there during the next summer season. It will be added in the final CEE.   
The emergency power generation facilities will be completed during 08/09summer season, and the facilities for emergency accommodation, emergency living and emergency storage will be completed during 09/10 summer season, which will be illustrated in the final CEE.
    • The size of the containers is measured in mm, and again it will be clarified in the final CEE.
    • The electric power will be transferred by cable buried in the snow. Power distribution systems and its EIA will be added to the final report. 
    • The main construction of the Station will be divided into 3 sections respectively for science work, public activities and accommodation. There will be 10 accommodation rooms with double layer beds, which in total can hold 20 people. The public area is mainly for having meals and recreation, and the science area is devoted to science research. The toilets and washing rooms are built close to the sewage system in order to minimize the length of the pipes, the further description will be addressed in the final report. 
Aircraft
    • Aircraft: several short sentences (p. 33, 68, 75, 85) refer to the possibility of “transportation of few personnel and small amounts of cargo to and from the Station by planes in the future”. This option must be considered in the CEE because it implies not only a possible preparation of an airstrip, but also a stock of kerosene for refuelling. Same remark for the “relay site” (p. 36) for which it would be useful to know the amount of fuel stored at this location, how (drums, tanks?) and if an airstrip will be prepared each year.(France)
    • As Mentioned in the draft CEE, the airplane will be used for transportation in future. The main purpose of the plane to be used is for emergency rescue and science activities. The fixed wing plane made in China (similar to DHC-6 twin otter made in Canada) might be used within next 5 years. Its maximum taking off weight is 5.7t and equipped with sledges for snow surface. The airstrip selected will be an open and flat area, it only needs simple rolling and without routine maintenance. The fuel will be stored in tanks at the relay site and does not need to store at Dome A Station. The relay site will store 6t of fuel for about 3 round flights from the Zhongshan Station to the Dome A during austral summer season. China will draw the experience from those countries fly in the Antarctic successfully and the details will be given in the final CEE.   
Vehicles
    • Vehicles: the draft CEE provides relatively few details on the characteristics of the vehicles and sledges used for the transport of personnel and cargo (only p. 43). It would be useful to have information on each vehicle type (size, weight, pressure on the ground, carburant consumption…), the composition and speed of the convoys, if the track is prepared or not by the first vehicle, how the refuelling will be done, and other details which could help in the evaluation of environmental impacts. In addition, it is not clear if the vehicles mentioned p. 65 (light snow vehicle, caterpillar carrier, snow motor vans) are among those used for the traverse or if they are transported to Dome A and stay here. In such case, it is not clear if they are listed in Table 1 (p. 39) or Table 2 (p. 40) (Material required for the station at Dome A). (France)
    • The information of the composition of the convoy has been given in the draft CEE. The vehicle convoy is composed of the heavy snow tractors, PB300 and PB240 vehicles. Thereinto, the heavy snow tractors are MT 865B in Caterpillar series: the length is 6754mm;the weight is 23~24t;the pressure on the ground is 0.48kg/c㎡;the carburant consumption 0.133 litre/km t. For the PB series: the length is 4790mm;the weight for PB300 is 5.5t and PB240 is 5t; the pressure on the ground is 0.046kg/c㎡, the carburant consumption is 0.14-litre/km t. For the 15t sledge, its pressure on the ground is 0.45kg/ c㎡. For both MT865 and PB series, the average speed is 8~9 km/h when their full loaded and their return speed is 11~12km/h. The vehicles carry the fuel barrels and tanks for refuel.  The MT865 series needs to refuel every 2 days and the PB series needs to refuel twice a day. The vehicles travel in a line and follow the track left by the first vehicle. The MT865 series is mainly used for transportation and the PB series is also used at the station. Further details will be added in the final CEE. 
Water supply and drainage system

    • Page 55 states that once Dome A Station is in operation, the Station will need 740 litres of water per day for 20 summering expeditioners.   This would only allow for 37 litres per day per person which appears to be quite low.  Page 94, states that the German Neumayer Station waster consumption per person is 117 litres and at the Amundsen-Scott Station it is estimated to be 95 litres.  Antarctica New Zealand estimates the water consumption at Scott Base to be around 130 litres of water per person, per day.  If the use of water for the flushing of toilets were removed, the estimate would be around 110 litres per person, per day.  These are all well in excess of the 37 litres estimated in the draft CEE.（New Zealand）
    • With respect to the ‘Water supply and drainage system’ (paragraph 2.5.5), we would appreciate if China could elaborate this a little bit more, especially how and where the ‘mining’ of the snow will be carried out to provide for the 440 litres per day of melting snow and what will be - in the long run - the effect of this on the immediate environment of the station.（Belgium）
    • Water Consumption: The Dome A area is on the top of the icecap and lack of adequate oxygen. Based on the calculation done by the scientist and taking into consideration of the safety and the environmental protection, the water consumption standard is defined. The detailed water consumption is given in the table 7. The consumption of water is rather low as it is mainly based on the factors below. The water used for bath is low. The expeditioners are advised to have fewer baths to reduce the possibility of altitude sickness; The water used for washing clothes is low. Except for underwears, the outer clothing will be collected to be returned to China for washing. The water used for cooking is low. The food for the expeditioners is thoroughly cleaned and packed at home, which can be used directly and without further cleaning. Generally, the food is ready made or semi-made, it needs simple processing and less water.
    • Water supply and drainage system: The sewage will be filtered and discharged into an ice pit. The discharging volume will be 70 liters a day. The summering expeditioners will operate in the Station for about 30 days and the total volume of the sewage discharged will be 2.1 m3. During each summer season, the ice pit of 4-5 m3 in size will be dug in the area where 30-40 meters away from the Station for holding the discharged sewage and cooling water drained from generators at the end of summer season. The ice pit will be fully filled to its original status when the summer season is over.
    • The snow for melting will be collected with the excavator from the surrounding area of the Station and carried to a snow tank where it will be melted by the residue heat from the power generators or by the heat from the solar heating system, without extra consumption of the power energy.
Other data
    • Baseline data：It describes the proposed activity, possible alternatives, and gives a brief description on how the baseline conditions will likely change. However, reference is given to baseline data having been gathered (Section 7), yet there is no mention as to what this data comprises. Section 4.5 on biodiversity refers to snow and ice samples being collected for analysis to obtain basic data (on microorganisms?) and this data should be included within the final CEE.（UK）
    • Personnel：The draft CEE states in Section 2.4.1 that the proposed station will initially accommodate 15-20 people and possibly 25 people in the longer term. The document could also specify the ratio of science to support personnel which, for a station designed to support research, would be useful as a measure of the station’s efficiency.(Australia)
    • Distance:Page 76 states that the linear distance from the plateau point to the Zhongshan Station is 1228km. And the actual driving distance is 1280km by snow vehicles.  However, there are several other references to distances in the draft CEE including: Page 42 (Figure 14)  = 1250 km;Page 42 (section 2.4.3) = 1200km(New Zealand)
    • Terms： description of methods and data used to forecast impacts Page 83 – New Zealand suggests that the terms and definitions be put in a table to make this section clearer. （New Zealand）
    • Icesheet’s movement:Page 95 makes reference to the fact that the ice-flowing is extremely slow in the Dome A area, however, there is no discussion on the southeast Antarctic icesheet’s movement in section 4 of the draft CEE.（New Zealand）
    • Oxygen production: details on the process used for oxygen production (p. 55), energy consumption, associated gas emission, O2 storage etc… would be useful.(France)
    • Year round station：Section 3.1.1 of the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2005) state that careful consideration is required to determine the full scope of the activity so that the impacts can be properly assessed.  It is stated throughout the draft CEE that the station will be a summer only station for the first 10 years of operation, with the intention to upgrade the facility to meet the needs of a year round station in the future.  It is not clear within the document whether this eventual upgrade is included under the scope of this EIA or whether the Chinese intend to cover such changes under a new EIA.  Fuel usage etc are all estimated for a summer only station, so the assumption is that the draft CEE does not cover any upgrade to a year round station.（New Zealand） 
    • No mention of possibility of overflying or visiting skua.  Skua are known to fly inland and have been seen at both the Pole, Vostok Station and at Dome C.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_C（New Zealand）
    • As for the environmental baseline data, percentage of the personnel, exact distance and the unified technical terms will be added into the final report.
 
    • The ice sheet movement: According to the primary observation, between the Zhongshan station and Dome A the ice sheet moves relatively slow in the Dome A area and in the area where 100km away from the Dome A, the rate of the ice sheet movement is about 1.3m/yr. With the continuous observation, there might be some further information.

    • Oxygen Production:Molecular sieve is used to produce the oxygen. The molecular sieve is very polar adsorptive to the non-oxygen constituents in the air, but weak adsorptive to the oxygen. When air flows through the molecular sieve, the non-oxygen constituents will be absorbed while the oxygen can be collected. 
The facility produces oxygen in a physical way, collecting oxygen directly from the air in a continuous and even way. The power of which is about 4KW.
To reduce the load caused by producing oxygen, the oxygen produced is not sent directly to the ventilation system, but to the special oxygen plug terminals through a dedicated pipeline to supply oxygen to the staff.
The facility can produce oxygen of 1.2 m3 per hour which can satisfy the need of 6-7 people (oxygen consuming per person: 0.18 m³/hour). There is another storage tank of 2 m3 (can contain oxygen of 12 m3 after compression.), which can be used for 20 persons for 3 hours if oxygen is needed by more people at the same time. All these information will be added in the final CEE.

    • Year round station: The Dome A station might be turned as a year round station 10 years late, if so, a further environmental evaluation will be done based on those future conditions; at present, China may add some information concerning the tentative idea that the station will operation as a year round station, the environmental impact and mitigation measures. 

    • The over flying or visiting of the skua: China takes note to the question that skua fly inland or even have been seen at both poles, but Chinese expeditioners have not yet seen skua in the Dome A area during their survey there. However, it may be listed in the monitoring plan.
Environmental impacts

    • Fuel& Oil pollution：
★Throughout the document it is noted that Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) will be used as the main fossil fuel source for the station and mechanical vehicles. While the use of ATK is reasonable as it is a fuel with high volumetric energy content, we do not feel that it is appropriate to describe any petroleum-based fuel as a “clean” fuel. As shown in the tables in Section 5.3 there will be a range of pollutant emissions from the ATK. References throughout the document could possibly describe ATK as a “relatively” clean option for the fuel requirements for the proposed activity, rather than a fuel that is clean in “absolute” terms.（Australia）
★Clean fossil fuel-aviation kerosenee: from our point of view, the use of the word “clean” for a fossil fuel carburant is inadequate, even if kerosene may appears as cleaner than other fossil-fuel products. In addition, the values of gas emission used in the draft CEE (Tables 11 and 12, p. 74) are those provided by the German Federal Environmental Agency in the final CEE on Neumayer 3 Station (Table 22 p. 65). These values are those of the kerosene used by a Dornier Do 228, with a turbine engine (turbo-propulsion). It is very unlikely that using kerosene in a diesel power generator will provide similar gas emission. In addition, looking at the emission factors provided in the Neumayer 3 CEE (p. 65), it seems that using polar diesel as carburant for the generators does not produce higher amount of pollutants in the gas emissions. So, the use of kerosene at Dome A should be more precisely justified.(France)
★5.3.1 Estimation on fuel consumption(Pg 85,last paragraph):Will the increase in personnel with the station and the increase in construction materials impact the amount of fuel used on the ship transit or increase the amount of fuel used at Zhongshan Station while personnel await their trip to Dome A?（US）
★Pages 43, 54 and 91 – Fuel tanks.  140 tons of fuel will be stored in 16 sledged fuel tanks (each 15m3) for transportation to the Station.    It is unclear whether these tanks then become the station tanks or whether a transfer will be made to the 10 bulk oil storage tanks discussed on page 54.  Section 5.4.2 discusses a double-layer storage tank with a leakage detecting system but it thought this tank is one of the 10 bulk oil storage tanks (each with a volume of 15 m3).  If this is the case then it remains unclear whether the sledged fuel tanks are double skinned.  The draft CEE discusses fuel in litres, tons and tanks in cubic meters. It would be helpful to the reader if the same unit were used throughout.（New Zealand）
★2.5.3 Oil storage system:Pg 54,1st paragraph: Are the ten tanks double-walled tanks?  Are they the same tanks mentioned later on Pg 92, 5.4.2 Mitigation measures for fuel and oil spill risks:  “Double-layer fuel tank will be provided for the storage of fuel”? 5.4.2 Mitigation measures for fuel and oil spill risks: Pg 92:“Double-layer fuel tank will be provided for the storage of fuel”? Which tanks are double-walled?  Does this include during the traverse?(US)
★More information is required on how oil leakages are to be avoided at Dome A and at Zhongshan Station, where additional storage capacity will be necessary. How and where will double-walled tanks and collecting basins be installed and how will oil depots be secured? （Germany）
★ (1) Estimated atmospheric emission in the stage of station construction:Pg 87,2nd paragraph: How much fuel will be required for heating and operating the station?  If this is accounted for in the 28 tons for “short distance transportation of vehicles in the station area,” a suggested rewording is: “28 tons of aviation fuel is needed for facilities operations, heating, and short distance vehicle transportation in the station area.”(US)
    • Flora and fauna：
★In Section 5, the environmental impacts of all logistic operations relating to the construction, operation and dismantling of the planned new station should be taken into account more comprehensively. Thus, various logistic operations at Zhongshan Station like e.g. storing, unloading activities and their impact on breeding birds and resting seals should be kept in mind. Furthermore, appropriate mitigation measures should be taken.（Germany）
★Investigations about the fauna and flora of the study area should include the surroundings of Zhongshan Station where activities will increase due to the construction and operation of the Dome A station. In order to assess the potential impact the construction of the station would have on local flora and fauna, the current situation must be analysed.（Germany）
★Section 5.8 and 5.9  - both discuss impacts on flora and fauna, which actually has a dedicated section in section 5.10. （New Zealand）
★Alien species：The risk of introducing alien species might be higher than “very little” (as stated in Sec. 5.12), especially during logistic operations in the area of Zhongshan Station. The proposed mitigation measures are not detailed enough to guarantee their efficiency.（Germany）

    • Wilderness Value：
★In contrast to the statement of p. 8, establishing a permanent facility like a new research station in a remote and pristine area of East Antarctica is likely to have a considerable impact on the wilderness value of the region. 
（Germany）
★There is very limited discussion about wilderness values. Page 100, Section 5.11, Physical interference, esthetic value – “In the design of the station, the local environmental conditions will be taken into full consideration, and harmonization with the local environment will be made to the greatest possible extent so as to minimize visual impact.”  The station is depicted in very bright colours, which does not correspond to the description above.  Perhaps a clause could be added to explain that for safety and practical reasons, the colour of the station must be an easy colour to see in white out conditions often experienced in the Antarctic environment.(New Zealand）
★The draft CEE of Dome A shares the shortcomings of many CEEs and IEEs in paying little attention to the impacts of the proposed activity on wilderness values. Under section 4.8 of the present draft CEE “Prediction of the future environment reference state in the absence of the proposed activities” (P. 81), it is said that without the proposed activities, “the value of wildness in the area will not be affected”. However, how wilderness values will be affected in presence of the proposed activities has not received substantial discussion in the draft CEE. ASOC contends that the construction and operation of a station and a 1 200 km traverse route in areas which have had little human presence until now are very likely to have significant impacts on the areas’ wilderness values. （ASOC）
    • Waste management：
★The management of solid, liquid and gaseous waste materials should follow the extended Antarctic Treaty guidelines and meet international standards. Information should be given on how and how much organic waste of Dome A station is planned to be treated in Zhongshan Station. （Germany）
★Human excrements: it is mentioned that they will be packed and shipped back to Zhongshan Station for treatment. What type of treatment? Moreover, it is stated in Table 25 (p. 114) that the sanitary facilities during the construction period are not yet determined. It would be recommended to fix this issue as soon as the start of the construction of the station.(France)
★Section 2.8.1 also indicates that all human excrement will be returned to Zhongshan station for “treatment”, but could also provide further details about the type of treatment and expected impacts, if any. Again, this is an example of possible environmental effects in the Larsemann Hills ASMA of activities primarily undertaken in support of the Dome A station.（Australia）
★Pages 56, 57, 70, 94, 95-97, 105 and 108 – Human waste. Several terms are used to describe human waste and the systems to deal with grey water which makes the description of this part of the activity very confusing.  Different terms are used to describe human waste including human excrement (page 56), human excretions (page 70), stool and urine (Table 7, page 56), blackwater (page 94), faeces (which does not appears to include urine, page 95), and night soil (page 56). Page 56 “Water supply and drainage system, 2) Water drainage” discusses human excrement (including night soil and urine) which will be packed automatically and shipped back to Zhongshan Station for treatment. Wastewater and sewage treatment (page 57) are then discussed but not in reference to human waste.  It is unusual for sewage treatment not to include human waste.  The term “black water” is used when discussing the sewage treatment system but in this instance does not appear to apply to human waste. Page 94, Section 5.6 Sewage, states “Domestic sewage (grey water and black water) will mainly come from cooking, daily washing and brushing, clothes washing, bathing, dish-washing and human excrement.”  The term sewage now covers human waste and it appears that blackwater is human waste.Page 95 discusses the type of toilet to be used on both the construction and operational phases of the activity.  Human waste is referred to as “faeces” in this section. It is not clear whether this includes urine. Pages 96, Section 5.7 Solid Waste, also refers to human waste.  Page 97 states, “part of the human excrement will be brought back to Zhongshan Station for disposal.”  It is unclear why only part of the human waste will be returned when the draft CEE states in earlier sections that all human waste will be returned to Zhongshan Station. Tables 22 and 23 (pages 105 and 108) discuss waste and in these tables it appears that sewage refers to human waste.  Both tables state that all human excrement will be packed and cased, and brought out of Antarctica.  This highlights an inconsistency with the text in the sections mentioned above which have already stated that the human waste will be treated at Zhongshan Station. Table 7 (page 56) also states that stool and urine (100%) will be shipped back which would imply a return to China. New Zealand would be very interested in receiving further information about the treatment of field waste at Zhongshan Station.（ New Zealand）
★It would be helpful for some additional clarification especially where there appear to be conflicting statements, eg is human waste to be transported back to China (as stated in Table 23 and elsewhere) or to Zhongshan Station (as stated on pg 56)? (UK) 
★2.8.1 Waste (Pg 70,2nd paragraph): What is the impact on Zhongshan Station’s sewage treatment plant with the additional load of 20 people’s waste and cooking waste?  (In 2) Water drainage, Pg 56 it is mentioned that waste will be treated at Zhongshan Station.  On page 70, it sounds as though there will only be some waste treated at Zhongshan Station.  These two sections appear to be in conflict.)(US)
★2.8.1 Waste, Pg 70, 3rd paragraph and 5.6.1 Assessment of Sewage impact, Pg 95, 1st paragraph: Where will the “ice pit” be located?  What is the length of time of the ice pit to the ocean?  What is the rate of movement of the ice sheet?
 Section 5.2(Pg 84,last paragraph):It should be noted that waste in the ice sheet will eventually move to and be released into the ocean.（US）
★How much residual water the ice pits may be able to hold, what kind of measures would be taken for reducing potential impacts on the immediate environment of the Dome A?  （Japan）
★2.8.3 Hazardous wastes(Pg 70,Last paragraph): Is there currently an identified site for hazardous waste? “The hazardous products and their empty packaging will be stored in specific areas and subject to strict monitoring.”（US）
★Further information would be appreciated on solid waste disposal ie the estimated quantity of hazardous waste from construction activities is '1 small box' (Table 19). Does this include waste fuels, oils, batteries, paints, solvents, adhesives etc ?(UK)
★5.7 Solid waste:Pg 96,Bullets:The solid waste categories listed here are different than the waste types mentioned before in Section 2.8.1 Waste, Pg 69.  On Pg 69, they are: “recoverable wastes, organic wastes, hazardous wastes and unrecoverable wastes”
Here on Pg 96, they are: Recoverable garbage (Metal, plastic, paper, wood and glass, etc.);Organic waste (Waste arising mainly from food);Hazardous waste (Category 4：Battery and waste fluorescent lamp etc.);Unclassifiable garbage; Fuel drum(US)
★3) Foundation and structure of the Station, Pg 51, 2nd paragraph and 5.11.2 Mitigation measures, Pg 100, 2nd to last paragraph:  Since the station foundation and supports may be buried over the 25-year life of the station, will these materials therefore remain after the station decommissioning?  Throughout the CEE, it is noted that all materials will be removed from the site at the time of decommissioning and dismantling the station.  This may be difficult to do if the station foundation and potentially other parts are already buried.  It may cause a greater environmental impact to dig out these materials and remove buried pieces than to allow them to remain in the ice sheet. （US）
★It is a long journey overland, and the weather may impact severely on supply runs. Accordingly, more information on the type of equipment (special waste storage tanks etc.) to be used for the removal of waste back to Zhongshan Station is suggested as it would be of interest. （South Africa）
★An ambitious waste management program has been planned for Dome A where all solid wastes are to be transported to Zhongshan station and repatriated to China from there. While little information is available to ASOC on the current waste management practices at Zhongshan station since the last inspection dates back to 19951, recent inspections at China’s Great Wall station in Fildes Peninsula have reported wastes piling up at the station2 and repatriation taking place approximately once every two to three years2,3. ASOC is concerned that if such is the situation at a coastal station on the Antarctic Peninsula waste management at remote inland station could become problematic. What measures will be taken to ensure that the waste management program for Dome A can be enforced as planned and also that Zhongshan station does not become a long-term repository for wastes shipped from Dome A?（ASOC） 

    • 其他
★What kind of and how much environmental impacts, other than on snow and ice, might be expected during transportation between Zhongshan Station and Dome A, in both summer and year-round operations?（Japan）
★Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures (Page 11,2nd paragraph, bullets): It seems that the physical footprint of the station and the traverse route would also be “direct impacts.”  Their impacts are currently included later in Section 5: “Identification of the Environmental Impacts and Preventative or Mitigating Measures.”
Overall comments for Section 5: Earlier, it is mentioned that the Station can be easily upgraded to a year-round station.  At this time, would there be an additional environmental assessment as the “Impacts” discussion for this CEE is currently limited to the operation of the station for only a couple months each austral summer?（US）
★Table 22 – the significance for all impacts stated in the impact matrix is low or very low (except for medium for a fuel spill over 1000l) and yet a CEE has been done for this activity.（New Zealand）
    • Fuel and oil pollution 
★Clean fossil fuel-aviation kerosenee:The comments put forward by Australia and France are accepted, it will be termed as Aviation Turbine Kerosene with high volumetric energy content in the final CEE. 
★Gas emission: The generators to be used for the proposed activity will be Deutz imported from Germany and Volvo from Sweden., gas emission of which can meet ERUO II or higher standards when they use diesel as fuel. At present, the generators haven’t arrived in China, so we can’t run trial operation with aviation kerosene to get data of gas emission. Diesel Generator Institute of Guizhou of China has experimented on some certain generators produced in China with similar performance as those imported. The experiment shows that the gas emission of the trial generator is less than but close to the data of the turbine engine provided by German colleagues in its final CEE on Neumayer 3. For example, NOx emitted by the experimented generator is 0.0386kg/a, and CO is 0.016 (0.0404 and 0.0169 quoted respectively in the Table 11 and 12).  Because the data provided by Germany is released publicly, therefore, we adopted the data of Germany as reference. The generators imported are superior than the experimented ones in performance, accordingly, the gas emission they produced is less than the data gained in the experiment.When the generators imported arrive in China , we will run trial operation with aviation kerosene, and all the data will be added in the final CEE.

★Fuel transportation and fuel stored in the Zhongshan Station: The number of berths of R/V “Xuelong ” is fixed. Normally, Xuelong carries around 150 personnel including crew and expedtioners each voyage. So the total personnel carried by Xuelong won’t increase during the construction and operation of the new Station. 300t extra cargo will be transported each summer season during construction period of the new Station, and when the Station comes to operating stage, the cargo needed will decrease to 100 t. R/V“ Xuelong ” transports about 1000t of cargo and fuel to Antarctica during normal voyage and the amount of fuel increased due to carrying extra cargo and fuel for construction of the new Station is limited. The personnel to the new Station may stay for ten days at Zhongshan station; the consumption of fuel there is also limited.     
★Oil storage system:  These 16 sledged fuel tanks will be firstly used to transport the fuel from Zhongshan Station to Dome A, 10 of which   will become the fuel storage tanks at the new Station when they arrive there.  The 16 sledged fuel tanks are used not only as transporting container, and also as storage container.
According to the original plan, these 16 tanks would be double-layer ones on account of consideration of safety and prevention of oil leakage. After the submission of the draft CEE, a further meeting was held to explore the necessity of the double layers. The conclusion was that oil tanks of single layer would be used in the first 2-4years on the consideration of two reasons given below. One is that the present transportation capability is limited. During the construction of the Station, more cargo need to be carried, and the weight of the double-layer tanks is about twice of the single-layer ones. If double-layer tanks are used, additional vehicles and fuels are likely needed. Second is that the improved single-layer tanks can meet the safety needs for operation in Antarctica. For example, the stainless steel of low-temperature resistant materials will be used, and an oil collecting basin will be installed at the bottom of each tank.    
The sledged fuel tanks will be towed and fixed to a ground 1 km away from the Station. The tanks will be separated and certain space will be kept between any two tanks and there is no link between tanks. These tanks fixed there simply as fuel storage system and there is no operation or activity of fuel transmission, therefore, without force outside, there would be no possibility of fuel leakage.
When it is needed, one fuel tank will be towed to the outside of the power generating house, the distance between the fuel tank and the power generating house shall meet the safety standards stipulated by Chinese related authority. When it is empty, another fuel tank will be towed to the outside of the generating house to replace the empty tank. The fuel tank and the fuel pump inside the generating house is connected through a pipe which has valves on each end and connection is done through fast switching jointer. The connection between the fuel tank and the pipe is done in the oil collecting basin to minimize the environmental impact. All these information will be added in the final CEE. 
★28 tons of aviation fuel is needed for facilities operations, heating, and short distance vehicle transportation in the station area..
    • flora and fauna:
Impact on the flora and fauna around Zhongshan Station due to increased activities for construction and operation of the Dome A station has been discussed in the draft CEE, further information and the issue relating to alien species will be added to the final CEE and the repetition will be deleted accordingly. 

    • Wildness value:
The wildness value was basically discussed in the draft CEE and more details will be added according to the questions raised. Regarding the color of the Station, on one hand, we agree with New Zealand that color easy to be distinguished in white Antarctic environment is used for safety reasons. On the other hand, the warm color is selected as the main color of the Station, which is suitable for mental relax in the white out condition.   
    • Waste management: 
★Human excrements:It was indicated under section 2.5.5 of the draft CEE that there would be 60kg human excrements produced per day at proposed new Station. It was also indicated under section 5.6.1.that packing-type water-free onboard toilets will be used during the construction period. Human excrements will be transported to the Zhongshan Station first, and then shipped back home for treatment. Some conflicting usage and uncertainty referring to human waste will be clarified and detail activities around the Zhongshan station shall meet the related regulations of the Larsemann Hills ASMA. All these will be given in the final CEE. 
★Ice pit: The location of the ice pit and the rate of the movement of the ice sheet will be included in the final CEE as mentioned above.
★Hazardous wastes: Hazardous wastes will be stored in specific area. Waste fuels, oil will be stored separately. Such information will be added in the final CEE.
★The conflict terms for solid waste will be clarified. 
★Station decommissioning: The station foundation is based on a compacted snow platform with 50-80 cm thick, and the supporting structure is 2.5 meters, which means the station is 3.0-3.3 meters above the snow surface. According to the present maximal snow precipitation record, the annual snowfall is 11cm, calculated on this, in 25 years, the snow accumulated there will be 2.75 meters thick, and the main building will still be above the snow surface. If take the average annual snowfall of 2005 and 2006, the snow surface will be around 2m high than now. All the main building and foundation could be dismantled and taken away under this condition. The data is limited at present, and when the station decommissions, the main building will be dismounted and sent back, for the foundation, according to the snow depth and the influence to the surrounding environment, it will be decided whether this foundation will be removed or kept untouched. All these information will be added into the final CEE.
★Type of equipment used to remove the waste to Zhongshan station: How to transport the wastes to the Zhongshan Station including the type of equipment will be clarified in the final CEE. 
    • Others
★In addition to the impact on snow and ice, the impacts of gas emission and oil spill due to transportation from Dome A to Zhongshan station were all included in the section 5 of the draft CEE.  
★The physical footprint at the Station and traverse route would be dealt with as direct impacts. The environmental impact and the related assessment as a year round station will be further discussed in the final CEE. 
★The impacts listed in table 22 was based on the construction scale, facilities concerned and operation duration, these will be reconsidered in the final CEE. 
Cumulative impacts
    • There is little mention in the draft CEE however of the additional indirect and/or cumulative impact (especially during construction) occurring in the Larsemann Hills when equipment and materials are unloaded, especially with respect to the introduction of alien species, and mitigation measures that will be adopted. We would welcome further discussion of this in the final document. The potential for alien species being introduced (and mitigation measures to prevent it) should also be included for the relay site and shelter in the Grove Mountains.（UK）
    • This section appears somewhat brief. Cumulative impacts will arise from the discharge of treated water, the atmospheric releases (of the station itself and combined with other stations in Antarctica), and a continual human presence in the area.  All of these could be explored further e.g. the amount of discharge over the life of the station at 70 litres a day. The cumulative impacts section could also address the building of another station in Antarctica, which is not mentioned in the draft CEE. Some of the proposed activity will take place around Zhongshan Station and cumulative impacts from such activity should be mentioned.（New Zealand）
    • As the CEEs of other plateau stations and multi-year traverses, in the draft CEE of Dome A the environmental impacts of the single station is considered in isolation from the rest of the developments that are taking place in Antarctica. This is in our view a significant omission. While the construction of a single station and its associated multi-year re-supply traverse are explained in the CEEs, no consideration has been given to the cumulative impacts of the increasing number of research stations and multi-year maintained traverse routes deep into the Antarctic wilderness. The environmental impacts of individual stations do not take place in a vacuum. They have the potential to interact and accumulate with other past, present and future activities. Continuing to increase the number of stations and multi-year traverse routes deep into the Antarctic wilderness without having established a strategic plan for its development and protection could result in greater loss of scientific, wilderness and aesthetic values than we are ready for. （ASOC）
    • As mentioned above, the details of the activities at the Zhongshan station and the relay site as well as the assessment on their impacts will be added in the final CEE.

    • The cumulative impacts will be further addressed in the final CEE. 
Environmental monitoring
    • The environmental monitoring plan (Sec. 7) should take into account biotic parameters. Furthermore, those areas of traverses that could likely be affected (e.g. coastal regions and surroundings of Zhongshan Station) should be paid attention to as well. （Germany）
    • 7.3 Monitoring of ice and snow samples (Pg 111):It seems that the scope would also include the traverse path. 7.4 Monitoring of oil spill(Pg 112):The scope for spills could include other areas where spills may occur, including on the traverse, at the station, etc and not be limited to the tanks.（US）
    • The proposed monitoring is welcomed, although this could be expanded upon in the final document, for example how many samples will be collected, what is the spatial coverage of the "surrounding area of the station", and what other determinands are included where "etc" is quoted?（UK）
    • A number of plans including the Waste Management Plan (WMP, page 69), the Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (page 68), and the Environmental Management Plan (page 115) are referred to in the draft CEE.  It would be useful if China included these plans in their Final CEE. New Zealand would also encourage China to organise an independent audit of the completed station against the final CEE.  New Zealand, as project manager of the ANDRILL programme, invited the BAS and AAD to conduct an independent audit on the ANDRILL project and found it to be a very useful exercise.  We strongly encourage independent audits as best practice against EIA at the CEE level.  （New Zealand）
    • Environmental monitoring: The environmental monitoring at the Zhongshan Station is a routine year round program and it will be continued. The environmental monitoring in the traversing area as well as the surrounding area of the proposed Station will be expanded and improved.

    • Auditing: China considers that an independent auditing and an integrated environmental management plan will be helpful to the Antarctic environmental protection. China has comprehensive auditing system from material purchasing to each building operation stage. China appreciates New Zealand’s practice and welcomes its suggestion on auditing.   

Uncertainties 
    • The uncertainties listed include those arising from the design of the station being continuously improved. it is hoped that further information will be provided on the design specification including materials used.（UK）
    • Page 81 states there is a lack of information on microorganisms fauna at Dome A.  This should therefore be listed in section 8, Gaps in Knowledge and Uncertainties. Page 50 - discusses precipitation at Dome A.  Large discrepancy between two years of collected data: 2006 = 50mm, and 2005 = 110mm.  This should be identified as an uncertainty. Page 78 -very little weather data recorded and wind data extremely patchy.  Weather is mentioned in section 8 as an unpredictable factor but it should be identified as a gap in knowledge as 2005 is the only year graphed.  Table 25 – lists a number of unknowns including fuel consumption, timeline, personnel numbers, design of station including the actual size of the station, location of the station etc.  These are all major parts of the activity and it would be therefore helpful to see limitations set – both maximum and minimum to be able to correctly assess the potential impacts from these activities e.g. number of personnel – minimum = 12, maximum = 30.  Without setting limitations, it leaves the activity largely undefined and therefore difficult to assess.（New Zealand）
    • The details of the construction materials will be provided in the final CEE.

    • The uncertainties will be clarified in the final CEE.
conclusion
    • The draft CEE concludes that “the construction and operation of the station may only cause minor or transitory impacts on the Antarctic environment”. This wording might be a result of the translation of the original document from Chinese into English, but the CEP has previously agreed that it is preferable for the overall assessment to draw directly on the terminology of Annex I the Protocol, by stating that a proposed activities to be assessed as: likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact; or likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact.（Australia）
    • The conclusion of the draft CEE states that “the construction and operation of the station may only have minor or transitory impacts on the Antarctic environment”. In general, Germany assumes that the establishment of a new station in the Antarctic is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. Otherwise it would not be necessary to prepare such detailed CEE document. Further mitigation measures could contribute to minimize the impacts on the environment. （Germany）
    • The conclusion of the draft CEE is: “the construction and operation of the station may only have minor and transitory impacts on the Antarctic environment”. Even if we recognize that the definition of a minor or transitory impact remains subject to discussion, France considers that establishment of a new station in Antarctica cannot be considered as having only a minor or transitory impact on the environment. In such case, it would not be necessary to produce such detailed CEE document. Article 3 of Annex I of the Protocol states that “if an Initial Environmental Evaluation indicates or if it is otherwise determined that a proposed activity is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact, a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation shall be prepared”. In the present situation and on the basis of the current draft CEE, France would prefer that the conclusion states that the activity will likely have more than a minor and transitory impact. In spite of this remark, we agree on the second conclusion of the draft CEE, considering that the initiation of the project is fully justifiable, at least on the basis of glaciological and geological scientific perspectives (deep ice core drilling and Gamburtsev sub-glacier Mountains studies). At the present time, the quality of the site for astronomy and the feasibility evaluation of development of such field of science still remain to be tested. (France)
    • The Non Technical Summary and conclusions state that the construction and operation of the station may only have minor and transitory impacts on the Antarctic environment - this does not seem to be supported by the fact (quite rightly in our view) that China has produced a CEE rather than an IEE. We would argue that the operational period of over 25 years is greater than transitory and therefore support the production of a CEE.（UK）
    • Section 10. Conclusion states that, “The construction and operation of the station may only have minor and transitory impacts on the Antarctic environment. Meanwhile the preventative and mitigating measures will further minimise the impacts on the environment.” Article 3.1 of Annex II, defines the need for a CEE as being, “If an Initial Environmental Evaluation indicates or it is otherwise determined that a proposed activity is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact, a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) shall be prepared.”  The conclusion statement within the Chinese CEE is therefore inappropriate for this level of EIA.  New Zealand recommends this conclusion statement be changed to the appropriate value judgement of significance for a CEE. The overriding conclusion of the draft CEE is that the construction of the station may only cause minor or transitory impacts on the surrounding environments.  As stated above, this value judgement of significance is not appropriate for a CEE. The information contained within the draft CEE adequately support a CEE level document as opposed to the conclusions of the draft CEE.  The building of a new station in Antarctica is a large activity, with many potential environmental impacts that could be more than minor or transitory – e.g. impacts on the wilderness values, a large fuel spill, longevity of the activity etc. （New Zealand）
    • Conclusion Page 12:Final paragraph:” The construction and operation of the Station may only cause minor or transitory impacts on the surrounding environments.” Because this document is a CEE, impacts must therefore be greater than minor or transitory.（US）
    • The conclusion of the CEE: There was inaccurate translation of the conclusion in the draft CEE, the correct expression should be: the proposed activities concerning construction and operation of the Station to be assessed as: likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact as understood and illustrated by Australia.

    • The conclusion of the draft CEE is that the proposed activities is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact. China noted that in general cases the conclusion of CEE is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact. Comparing with those new stations built or to be built in Antarctica, the proposed station which will be built at Dome A is small in scale, and less labor force is involved during construction and a few personnel will stay at the station during its operation. Furthermore, its operation duration is short (only two months, including the travel time). Meanwhile, a series of prevention and mitigation measures will be adopted. Based on the information above, China draw the conclusion of “to have no more than a minor or transitory impact”.
Meanwhile, China considers that CEE can have two kinds of conclusions according to the Article 3 of the Annex 1, that is“a proposed activities to be assessed as: likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact; or likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact”. China would like to have a discussion on this with other members. 
China is available to undertake a further environmental evaluation based on fully improving all kinds of plans concerning the proposed activity including transportation, construction, operation, prevention and mitigation measures, environmental monitoring, etc. 

Expression
    • Most of the report is comprehensible although there is some repetition and removal of these paragraphs would improve the flow or readability. There are also a few statements that do not appear to have translated well or perhaps could be better defined or require further explanation. For example, what is the PANDA programme (pg 20)? and what is "intelligent dust" (Pg 24)? 
On p.21 there is an emphasis on the importance of international collaboration but in the following pages (pp.22-24) there is no information on how this is going to be achieved for the key science tasks. For example, section 1.3.3 mentions a programme of aircraft remote sensing but no details are given. 
There appears to be a mistake on p.13 where the report states that the ice record might go back in time to the Miocene (i.e. as much as 5 m.y.). We consider that the greatest length of record is unlikely to be more than 1.5 m.y. 
We hope these comments are helpful and look forward to seeing responses from others within the ICG and receiving further information and/or clarification from the Chinese authorities."（UK）
    • There are several examples where the same information is repeated throughout the document. China might consider editing and consolidating the text to cut down on this repetition when preparing the final CEE.（Australia）
    • Some figures are poorly illustrated (e.g. lack of legend at Fig. 5, 9, 10, 27) and some facts are repeated several times. A separate section about the impacts of the planned additional activities at Zhongshan Station and their relationship to the regulations of the Management Plan of the ASMA No. 6 would be helpful for clarification.（Germany）
    • Many repetitions can be avoided (e.g. reference to mean and minimum annual temperatures appears at least 5 times in the text, idem with the size of the area and its water drop shape etc..). The distance between Zhongshan Station and Dome A by snow vehicle needs homogenization throughout the text. In the current draft, this distance varies from 1250 km (Fig. 14 p. 42) to 1280 km in several other places. Idem for the straight distance, varying from 1200 km (text page 42) to 1228 km in other places. The time schedule of the yearly expeditions (duration of the ground traverse between Zhongshan Station and Dome A) and the duration of the station activity in summer is not clear. There is likely a mistake in the first bullet page 37 which states that the station will be opened “from the early January to the early February of the next year”.(France)
    • Overall New Zealand considers the draft CEE to be a well-written document.  A minor point is that the document would be more concise if some of the repetition were edited.  Clarification in the Final CEE of the points raised in the first TOR will make it a very concise and well produced document.（New Zealand）
    • Some environmental impacts arising from the Zhongshan – Dome A traverse have been discussed in Section 5. For the purposes of clarity, they should also appear under a separate activity in the impact matrix. （ASOC）
    • The term “International Polar Year 2007-2008” should be used instead of “4th International Polar Year.” “International Polar Year 2007-2008” is an officially used term. (Page 8, 36th line)（Japan）
●2.4 Principal Characteristics of Proposed Activities  
Page 37:Under “Station Characteristics”:
First bullet- reword: "Austral summer Station: open from the early January to the early February of the next year".
    • Suggest: "Austral Summer Station: open for one month each year from early January to early February"
Second bullet- reword: "The main building of the Station is designed for accommodating 15~20 people for a short term and 25 people for a long term.”
    • Suggest: "The main building of the Station is designed to accommodate 15-20 people in its first ten or so years of operation while it is a summer-only station.  Ultimately, the Station is designed to accommodate 25 people when it is a year-round station.”
