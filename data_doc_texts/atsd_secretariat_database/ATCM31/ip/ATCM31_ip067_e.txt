Romania application for SCAR admission


The Romanian Academy, a Member of ICSU, by this appoints the Romanian Polar Research Institute, Bucharest, to represent Romania as an Associated Member in the Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research (SCAR) - the scientific organism of the Antarctic Treaty, in which Romania is a Member State since 1979.   

Current and recent scientific activities

The Romanian Program of Polar Research was initiated in 1987, and the first ten expeditions of polar research have been organized in the Arctic (Greenland, Spitsbergen, the Extreme North of Canada, North Siberia, North Pole area), where research on: glacial and periglacial geomorphology, cryosoils, Arctic flora (vegetation chromatography) and fauna (freshwater crustaceans, reindeer migration), microbiology, pollution (with heavy metals, pesticides and radionuclids) have been carried out.
The evolution of the Romanian research in Antarctica was a result of the cooperation with the countries that agreed to take the Romanian teams on board of their polar research ships and to collaborate with us (Russian Federation and China). 
The quality of the Romanian research in Antarctica was improved based on the support from Australia, that agreed by the Memorandum in 2005 to open in 2006 the Law-Racovita Station in Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica also for Romanian activities.

The main Romanian research and studies in Antarctica, Law Racovita Station included, referred to:
    • The pollution degree and distribution in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (contaminants and sources, pollution pathways) – heavy metals, radionuclids  and persistent organic compounds;
    • Cryopedology (soil formation processes and stages under extreme conditions); 
    • Models of climate change study by means of 18O and 2H isotopes; study of  isotopic effects within the water-ice-snow exchanges; 
    • Antarctic ecosystems, terrestrial and marine flora and fauna; 
    • Antarctic soil and aquatic microorganisms, adaptability mechanisms under extreme life conditions, and their biologically active products (enzymes, etc.) with possible future applications in biotechnologies;
    • Antarctic viruses, host-virus relationship, viral infections; 
    • Human medical research: organism resistance, adaptability, behaviour and nutrition under extreme life and work conditions; 
    • Specific polar logistics and research activities in the Larsemann Hills, Law-Racovita station in cooperation with Australia, China and Russian Federation. 

The Romanian research institutes and universities carrying out polar studies are involved, often in cooperation, in various research programs and projects: excellence, ideas, capacities and networking projects, both national and European (FP7) or international. 
Romania also carried out activities specific to Antarctic Treaty organisms (SCAR and CEP). The Romanian Polar Research Institute and Romanian Antarctic Foundation also developed important dissemination activities in order to increase the interest of the young generation and the general public in polar research, especially related to the climate change phenomena and the necessity to take adequate steps to mitigate their effects. 

Romanian Polar Research Institute organized and coordinated, in 2006 and 2007 in Romania, as activities within the national excellence research projects of “networking” type, two international polar research symposia, the last one being coupled with the International Workshop “The European Polar Research Icebreaker AURORA BOREALIS – FP7 Project”, coordinated by European Science Foundation and „Alfred Wegener” Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Germany. These symposia were important dissemination frameworks for the Romanian polar research results and perspectives, with a significant visibility and resonance in the European area. 

Among the Romanian Polar Research Institute foreign partners, Australian Antarctic Division played an important role in the proposal and achievement phases of the networking excellence research projects 2006-2008.   

Researchers from thirteen Romanian institutes and universities carrying out scientific research in Antarctica and in Arctica. 

As a future Associated Member of SCAR Romania will respect the principles of protection of the Antarctic Environment recommended by SCAR. After his admission Romania will improve the quality of scientific Antarctic research.
