A Marine Perspective





Regulation of Antarctic Tourism--A Marine Perspective

Information Paper Submitted by
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Introduction
An extensive framework of international conventions, national regulations and industry standards exist to regulate tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica.  
These include (1) “internal” provisions adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM’s) (Appendix 1); (2) numerous mandatory, legally binding measures adopted with a global application (Appendix 2), specifically including treaties under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), an agency of the United Nations established in 1948; and (3) a suite of industry standards set by IAATO (Appendix 3 in part) which augment the first two categories. This paper summarizes the broad range of regulatory mechanisms now in place, and explains IAATO’s self-regulating and management role in actively implementing and supplementing governmental mechanisms. Concerns have been raised by Antarctic Treaty Parties, IAATO Members, the IMO, the press and other stake holders about the adequacy of each type of regulatory regime currently in place. Regulating Antarctic tourism is a dynamic system and there must be synergy between all regulatory and management requirements in order to maintain an effective regulatory system for Antarctic Tourism from a marine perspective. While there might be gaps in the current framework, as a whole the tourism industry cannot be viewed in isolation and all three areas of regulation and management need to be interlinked.

Background-- An Antarctic Treaty System Perspective
The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 was the first international agreement to address human activity in Antarctica.  The regulation of tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica has received specific attention from the ATCM ever since 1966 when the first Recommendation (IV-27) on the “Effects of Antarctic tourism” was adopted at the 4th ATCM.
Since then numerous further Recommendations, Resolutions and Measures addressing tourism and non-governmental activities have been introduced.  Such “direct” regulation over the past 40 plus years by the Treaty Parties spans three distinct phases – pre-Environmental Protocol (1961-1991), the Environmental Protocol itself (1991) plus the Liability Annex (Annex VI adopted as Measure 1 (2005)), and post-Environmental Protocol (1992 to the present).
The earlier first-phase regulations have now been largely superseded, though the range of issues addressed by Recommendation VIII-9 (Oslo, 1975) demonstrated the commitment of the ATCPs to ensure adequate regulatory control of what was then a small industry.
Undoubtedly, the most substantive set of regulations governing tourism and non-governmental activities within the Antarctic Treaty System can be found in the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and its various Annexes (including the Liability Annex). The Protocol and its Annexes very explicitly address “activities....pursuant to scientific research programmes, tourism, and all other governmental  and non-governmental activities.....for which advance notice is required in accordance with Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty, including associated logistic support activities”. The Protocol and its Annexes therefore apply in their entirety to all tourism and non-governmental activities within the Antarctic Treaty area.
Since 1991, other key tourism-related texts have been adopted by the Treaty Parties.  With the change in decision-making by the ATCM in 1995, they include Resolutions (non-mandatory texts), Decisions (administrative texts) as well as mandatory Measures. Key amongst these more recent texts have been activity guidelines held under Recommendation XVIII-1 (1994) and Resolution 4 (2007), insurance and contingency planning (under Measure 4 and Resolution 4) (2004), and the Site Guidelines adopted by the ATCMs in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and Resolution 4 (Ship-based Tourism in the Antarctic Treaty Area) and Resolution 5 (Tourism in the Antarctic Treaty Area) in 2007.

Indirect Antarctic Treaty System Involvement
In addition to agreements addressed specifically to tourism and non-governmental activities, other texts have been developed or adopted by the Treaty Parties that, while generic in their application to Antarctic activities, have an indirect (though crucially important) bearing on tourism and non-governmental activities.  Such generic provisions have addressed, for example, protected and managed areas as well as environmental monitoring and data management.  All clearly focus on the regulation and management of tourism and non-governmental activities.
Of particular relevance to this Information Paper, with its focus on regulation of the tourism cruise industry, are those ATCM Decisions and Resolutions relating specifically to shipping activities.  These include the Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic and Antarctic Ice-covered Waters as well as Resolutions adopted in 2005 on the use of Heavy fuel Oil (HFO) for vessel propulsion, and in 2006 on ballast water discharge.  It should be noted however, that most of these issues are as yet unresolved though they remain under active consideration – both by the Antarctic Treaty Parties as well as by the IMO.
The over-arching role and responsibility of the IMO for regulating the activities of ships worldwide, including within the Antarctic Treaty Area, was clearly recognized by the ATCPs at ATCM XXVII (2004) when Decision 4 requested the IMO to address elements relating to Antarctic waters in the Polar Shipping Code.  An amended draft text of the Code was forwarded to the IMO for its consideration.  The IMO’s role was further reinforced in 2005 by the ATCPs through the preambular text of Decision 8 (dealing with HFO) that indicated that the “International Maritime Organization is the competent organization to deal with shipping regulation”.  What lay behind such action was not only an appreciation by the Treaty Parties (all of whom are also parties to the IMO) of that organization’s legitimacy to regulate shipping activities in Antarctic waters, but also the realization that only provisions adopted by the much wider membership of the IMO (167 Member States) could ensure proper regulatory control of all tourism (and other) vessels operating in the waters of the Antarctic Treaty Area.  While all Antarctic passenger vessels are flagged to IMO Members, in some years up to 50% of passenger vessels are flagged outside of the Antarctic Treaty Party States.  The ATCPs clearly recognized that only the wider application of IMO provisions could ensure compliance with provisions relevant to Antarctic conditions.

Global Regulation of Ships and the Antarctic Treaty Area
Although some provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System deal with shipping-related activities (notably Annex IV to the Environmental Protocol which addresses largely marine pollution matters), they are, on the whole limited in their scope and application.  The bulk of regulations relating to shipping activities within the Antarctic Treaty Area reside with the IMO and other international shipping regulations (see Appendix 2).  The regulatory network under which vessels in Antarctic waters operate is both comprehensive and complex and can be reviewed in four categories:
    • Safety of vessels;
    • Safe vessel operations;
    • Emergency response action; and
    • Environmental safeguards.

Safety of Vessels
Safety of vessels is the primary objective of the IMO and is addressed by the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) - a key international treaty under the IMO’s purview.  SOLAS was adopted in 1974 but has been amended frequently since.  SOLAS specifies the internationally-accepted standards that govern all aspects of ship design, construction, equipment, operation and manning to prevent accidents.  Inspection and monitoring of compliance with SOLAS provisions is the responsibility of the Member States, although the IMO has developed an audit scheme to assist Member States with these functions.  The International Convention on Load Lines (1966), which has been updated and harmonized with SOLAS, provides technical rules for the construction and loading of ships to ensure their stability and seaworthiness.
Further assurance of compliance with standards is provided by the classification societies (such as the American Bureau of Shipping, Det Norske Veritas and Lloyd’s Register), which set technical standards for the design, construction and periodic survey of vessels, and grant a certificate of classification to a vessel if all standards are met.  It should be noted that ships strengthened for operating in ice-covered waters may be certified at various ice-class levels as part of the classification process, though no unified classification yet exists amongst the classification societies on ice-strengthening standards.  National maritime authorities generally use classification society inspections to supplement compliance monitoring.  Vessels are also subject to a compliance review, onboard inspections, and potential detention by port states (e.g., by national authorities in ports of call outside the flag state).

Safe Vessel Operation
Safe vessel operation is also addressed by IMO rules contained in SOLAS and particularly in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).  The STCW provides standards to ensure that ships are adequately crewed by competent, trained and appropriately experienced mariners, and was amended in 1997 to include specific requirements for training of passenger ship crews (see Appendix 1).  The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (72 COLREG or Rules of the Road) provide rules for manoeuvring, lights, day shapes and sound signals for all vessels, and are a required qualification for all deck watch officers.
In addition, since 1998 SOLAS has required vessels and companies to implement an International Safety Management (ISM) system, which encompasses: 
    • Adoption of a safety and environmental policy;
    • Instructions and procedures to ensure safe operation of ships and protection of the environment in compliance with relevant international and flag state legislation;
    • Defined levels of authority between ship personnel and shore management;
    • Procedures for reporting accidents;
    • Procedures to prepare for and respond to emergency situations;
    • Procedures for internal audits and management reviews.
ISM thus takes accident prevention beyond simple compliance with rules and standards, by requiring a formal, institutionalized system of continuing management to ensure that a high level of safety is achieved.

Emergency Response Action
Emergency response procedures are also established under IMO cognizance, which has recognized that despite aggressive prevention measures, procedures must be in effect to deal with accidents and emergency situations.  The basic international framework, providing a global system for responding to emergencies, is provided by the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) (1979).  The provisions of the convention are captured in a shipboard “user’s manual”, the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR).  IMO’s Marine Safety Committee has continued to review emergency planning and procedures, issuing the following updated guidance in May 2006:
    • Guidance to Recovery Techniques Using Equipment Currently Available (MSC Circular 1182) which expands IAMSAR information and is applicable to passenger vessels that may need to assist personnel from another vessel.
    • Enhanced Planning for Passenger Ships operating in Areas Remote from SAR Facilities (MSC Circular 1184) which provides operators and vessels with information for planning voyages in areas such as the Antarctic.
A key element of emergency response is effective communication.  SOLAS addressed this issue comprehensively in 1988 by establishing the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), which incorporated existing and new communications procedures and equipment to enhance the functions of alerting, SAR coordination, locating, disseminating safety information, and ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship communications.  Notable GMDSS provisions include emergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs) to locate ships in distress by satellite, SAR radar transponders to facilitate location of life boats and rafts, and automatic broadcast and receipt of safety information (NAVTEX).  GMDSS provisions became mandatory for passenger vessels in 1999.

Environmental safeguards
Environmental safeguards at the most basic level are provided by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (1973, modified by the protocol of 1978) (MARPOL 73/78), which implements strict provisions to minimize pollution from ships by oil, sewage, garbage and engine exhaust, due to either operational or accidental causes.  MARPOL 73/78 has been continually updated with additional provisions, including designation of Antarctica as a Special Area with increased oil, noxious liquids and garbage safeguards in 1992 and 1994.  All IAATO operated member vessels are subject to the mandatory provisions of the Convention.
Other regulations aimed at environmental protection have been promulgated by international conventions under IMO auspices.  These include:
    • International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (1972) and its 1996 Protocol (in force 2006) supplements the provisions of MARPOL 73/78;
    • International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (in force 1995) requires ships to have oil pollution emergency plans and to report incidents of pollution;
    • Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Co-operation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances (in force 2007) requires shipboard pollution emergency plans to deal with incidents involving defined hazardous and noxious substances;
    • International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (in force late 2008) addresses harmful effects of chemicals from hull coatings on ships;
    • International Convention for the Control and Management of Ship’s Ballast Water and Sediments (2004, not yet in effect) attempts to prevent environmental harm from invasive species transported in ballast water.  Guidelines for Ballast Water Exchange in the Antarctic Treaty Area have been adopted by the IMO (Resolution MEPC.163(56), 2007) and Antarctic Treaty System Resolution 3 (2006) as voluntary interim rules that recognize the sensitive nature of Antarctic waters.

The Role of IAATO
Further discussion on the regulation of tourism has become increasingly important as Antarctica has become more popular as a destination for recreational visits.  While growing numbers of passengers could present environmental challenges, the opportunity for the world’s citizens to see Antarctica also solidifies popular support for preserving the continent’s environmental integrity.  All tour organizations and operators are obligated to adhere to their domestic legislation that implements the Environmental Protocol and other agreements adopted by the ATCPs.
IAATO implements agreements set forth by the Antarctic Treaty Parties as well as the goals of the Environmental Protocol and its subsequent agreements which detail operational procedures for safe and environmentally responsible tourism.  Founded in 1991 and having a current membership of 107 organizations, many of IAATO’s procedures were in place prior to the issues being raised in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCMs) or addressed by other international agreements.  IAATO has been an active participant in ATCMs and other international forums providing information on Membership developments, guidelines and procedures (Appendix 3) since it’s founding in 1991.  IAATO membership today encompasses virtually all Antarctic commercial ship operators.  As of May 1, 2008, 100% of all passenger vessels carrying more than 12 passengers and nearly all commercial yachts planning activities during the 2008-09 season in Antarctica are operated by Member Companies of IAATO.  
IAATO views, as one of its important functions, the need to clarify, standardize and indeed strengthen the international regulatory regime in respect of Antarctic shipping operations.  IAATO provides an extensive set of guidelines that substantially enhance Member Companies’ compliance with the regulatory requirements and in many cases provides safety and environmental safeguards substantially in excess of formal requirements.  
IAATO Members vigorously comply with the planning, operations and reporting procedures contained in Appendices 1 and 3 and in the Guidance for those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic (Recommendation XVIII-1 ATCM XXVIII, 1994). Although those guidelines have yet to enter into force, IAATO has required their operators to implement them.  Further, IAATO promotes “best practices” for vessels engaged in tourism in the Antarctic Treaty area (south of 60 degrees latitude), including:
    • Doubling watch officers on the bridge, which allows one officer to devote full-time attention to navigation and another to concentrate on conning (manoeuvring) the vessel;
    • Embarking an experienced ice pilot to advise and assist the ship’s captain with route planning, ice avoidance and safe speed, considered in terms of the ship’s capabilities, when ice is in the vicinity;
    • Providing detailed scheduling information to members and ships, to facilitate vessel route planning, avoidance of traffic congestion and emergency assistance;
    • Voluntarily extending the obligations of the MARPOL Special Area northwards from its 60° South latitude boundary to a line approximating the Antarctic Convergence with regard to waste management.
 The IAATO Vessel Emergency Contingency Plan and IAATO Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response increase both the preparedness of IAATO vessels operating in Antarctica and their ability to assist each other in the event of an emergency.  The IAATO Plan amplifies international regulations to ensure that Antarctic cruise vessels have adequate emergency equipment, frequently update schedules and positions, are capable of effective ship-to-ship communications for a possible event, and have arrangements in place for medical evacuation support.  The benefits of contingency planning were demonstrated in January 2007 when 294 passengers from the cruise ship MV Nordkapp were transferred to another IAATO Member vessel as a precautionary measure following a temporary grounding, and again in November 2007 when all 154 passengers and crew of the MS Explorer were rescued without serious injury or loss of life by a responding IAATO Member vessel.
IAATO issues guidance annually to its members in the form of its Checklist and Seasonal Instructions for Expedition Leaders and Ships’ Officers. These summarize the organization’s high standards and requirements in a comprehensive fashion.  IAATO’s efforts to protect the Antarctic environment are further manifested in the development and promulgation of a variety of guidelines and procedures.  A complete listing can be found in Appendix 3, but some noteworthy examples include:
    • Mandatory safety and code of conduct briefing for all passengers and crew;
    • Guidelines for Visitors to the Antarctic (posters and leaflet);
    • Marine Wildlife Watching Guidelines (posters and leaflet);
    • Boot, Clothing and Equipment Decontamination Guidelines (posters and leaflet);
    • IAATO Wilderness Etiquette;
    • Site guidelines for more than 45 Antarctic sites;
    • Station visit policies.
Using these guidelines, IAATO members make conscientious efforts to educate both passengers and crews about environmentally sensitive practices.  IAATO guidelines, which have been  in place since 1991, ensure the presence of no more than one ship at a site at one time, limit visitors ashore to no more than 100 passengers at any one time, prescribe a 1:20 guide to visitor ratio, and prohibit any landings from ships carrying  more than 500 passengers.  These IAATO guidelines were adopted by the ATCPs into Site Guidelines beginning in 2005.
IAATO provides a valuable role by assembling and maintaining comprehensive information for its members’ operations, which form the great majority of Antarctic tour operations.  IAATO collects schedule information in standard formats, reviews Post-Visit Reports (also submitted to national authorities) and provides comprehensive reporting at the end of each season.  Tourism statistics are posted annually on IAATO’s website based on the Post Visit Reports of all vessels (members and non members) and the end of season reports of the companies.  IAATO continues to provide the most comprehensive information on the status and trends of Antarctic tourism to inform international dialogue and decisions on the regulation and management of the industry. 
Importantly, IAATO’s systems, guidelines and procedures are dynamic requirements regularly being reviewed, strengthened or augmented by the development of new agreements within the Association (for example, see ATCM XXXI IP81: Summary Report and Outcomes of IAATO’s Marine Committee Meeting on Vessel Operations, Safety and Related Issues). 
Summary
All marine operators are subject to a complex regime of international regulations governing virtually all aspects of -ship-based tourism in Antarctica.  Through its Bylaws, IAATO requires its members “to operate within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System, including the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection, along with the IMO Conventions and similar international and national laws and agreements.”  Moreover, IAATO has been a forerunner in recognizing safety and environmental concerns, and establishing procedures to address those concerns quickly and effectively.  IAATO members have consistently agreed to implement standards that are higher than legally required, and will continue to adopt such an approach to the future regulation and management of Antarctic tourism.  
To regulate and manage Antarctic tourism effectively in the future requires an understanding of the current regulatory regimes in place, and the development of a sophisticated collection of interactive mechanisms between the various international bodies, all of whom play a role in the regulation of Antarctic Tourism from a marine perspective.
