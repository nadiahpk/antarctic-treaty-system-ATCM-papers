Field-based research in the Grove Mountains has focused on geology, geomorphology, glaciology, studies of meteorites and others carried out by researchers from Australia, China and Russian Federation.

Romanian Polar Research Institute had performed microbiological research on a few soil samples carried out in 2003, during the 19th Chinese Antarctic Expedition.   

Data obtained prove that arid, sandy soils humidity from Grove Mountains, with a average of 0,39-0,58% is a restrictive factor of bacteria presence in soil, but not also of some fungs species. The humidity influence corelates with the content of organic and anorganic substances that can be assimilated and the temperature variations at high altitude. Because of limited time were prelevated only 14 samples from five locations. Aerobic mezophilic bacteria were represented by Bacillus sp. 100 ufc/g soil (*ufc=colonies generator units), Pseudomonas sp. 8,64 ufc/g soil, Pseudomonas fluorescens 9,87, Sarcina sp. 9,87 ufc/g soil, values 100 times more than those identified in King George Island. 
Representative fungs and yeasts sorts are Aspergillus niger 9,85, Aspergillus glaucus 9,87, Rhodotorula 10,52, Penicillium sp. 10,01100 ufc/g soil; mixed cultures of Penicillium sp. and Candida sp. (21,04); Aspergillus niger, Candida sp. and Saccharomyces sp. (110 100 ufc/g soil). From the study of the quantitative variation of the soils microbiota with the content of free water results that the presence of microorganisms in soil depend on the soil humidity and on their capacity to adapt to restrictive environment conditions through spores forming (for example, Bacillus bacteria, mouldiness from Aspergillus, Penicillium sorts). They missed from some microorganims samples. 

Determinant environmental conditions for microbial composition are low temperatures and the quasi-inexistent humidity. A number of molecular mechanisms are responsible for the adaptation of life to cold environments, the most important being the changes in enzyme structure, i.e. increased flexibility and decreased stability.

The study will continue in order to establish some similarities with soils from Larsemann Hills and for prediction of the role of the microorganisms from these areas in bioremediation.
 
We suggest that the objectives of a future Management Plan of Grove Mountains should include also biological data of the area.
Efforts will be made to increase knowledge of the environmental importance of the Area, and the impacts of human activities.
