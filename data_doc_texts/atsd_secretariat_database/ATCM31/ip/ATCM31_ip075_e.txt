Non-native Species Incursions at Scott Base, Antarctica

Information Paper Submitted by New Zealand

1. Introduction

New Zealand has been working steadily over the last two years to set up and improve our processes to prevent non-native species reaching Antarctica, in line with the Committee’s endorsement of the recommendations of the Non-native Species in Antarctica Workshop (ATCM XXIX/WP8 2006).

We have given the issue a high profile in our programme which has resulted in the interception of many invertebrates from our cargo and fresh supplies as well as a quantity of soil from boots, equipment and cargo before they have been sent to Scott Base. Another consequence of the higher profile the issue of non-native species has had within our programme is that there has been an increase in reporting of incursions.

In this paper, we give a factual account of a significant incursion of flies that bred at Scott Base during 2007, and our response and management of that incident. We also list the other reported incursions from the 07/08 season and give some results from our inspections of fresh supplies before they were sent to Antarctica. 

We hope that this information will be useful to other national programmes and that it will contribute to the pool of knowledge on managing the issue of non-native species in Antarctica. We encourage the sharing of information about work on non-native species so that the risk and processes of incursions can be better understood and, therefore, mitigated.


2. Chronology of events around the incursion of flies at Scott Base

Feb 07
    • Annual bulk re-supply shipment to Scott Base
    • Approximately 20 flies reported in field centre and adjacent linkway
    • Critical incident management process initiated
    • Last inter-continental flight to Scott Base for the season on the 24th

Mar 07

    • All Christchurch and Scott Base staff briefed
    • Technical advice sought from domestic biosecurity agency (MAF BNZ) scientists
    • McMurdo Station briefed
    • Preliminary identification via remote imaging shows flies are of the family Drosophilidae (vinegar flies) (see figure 1 below)

Apr 07
    • Approximately 715 flies, larvae and eggs observed inside beer pallets in cardboard soaked in leaked beer (see figure 1 below)
    • All affected pallets taken outside where the insects died quickly. All of the affected cans and cardboard stored outside in a sealed plastic container and triple bagged
    • 1-2 flies per week continue to be seen following the clean up
    • Daily inspections and spraying of alcohol storage area commenced
    • Technical advice confirmed that the first priority was to remove all potential ‘host material’ (food sources for the flies)
    • Weekly advisory group meetings established with scientists from Biosecurity New Zealand, Scott Base Manager and Environmental Advisor
    • Cargo and fresh goods supply processes reviewed

May 07
    • Initial eradication plan completed
    • Surveillance programme: Fruit, sugar and light traps established in all affected areas 
    • Internal quarantine: Sterilisation of all food and rubbish bins, all open food containers from the affected area sealed outside in waste system, all waste frozen, all vehicles sterilised (‘cold’ for at least 2 hours), all kitchen equipment sterilised, no food taken outside the kitchen and dining area, lights kept off and doorways kept shut in the linkway between the affected area and the rest of the station
    • Ongoing control: Weekly trap and stock inspections on-going, routine spraying programme established, mapping of spraying and trapping areas established
    • Reporting system: Weekly information sharing and review of the eradication plan and record keeping, encouraging staff to look out for flies, planning for measures at the opening of the season

Jun 07
    • 4 Flies observed
    • Trapping network expanded
    • Temporary kitchen and Field Service Centre floors and drains scrubbed and bleached

Aug 07
    • 10 flies observed
    • First intercontinental flight to Scott Base for the season on the 20th
    • All cargo carefully handled and inspected, and all fresh supplies inspected in detail both in Christchurch and at Scott Base
    • All sinks and drains in the affected area scrubbed, de-greased and sanitised
    • Alcohol store emptied out, checked, walls and floor bleached
    • Permanent light traps established at Scott Base
    • Network of sticky traps established to supplement existing traps
    • More samples returned to Christchurch for identification
    • System established to inspect all fresh fruit and vegetables bound for Scott Base as they are being packed at the wholesale yard

Oct 07
    • Formal identification of flies:
    • Drosophila virilis Sturtevant (no reference found to this species ever having been reported in New Zealand or Australia, buts has been recorded worldwide in wine production areas as well as indoors in some breweries (Baechli et.al. 2004).
    • Drosophila immigrans Sturtevant. This is a cosmopolitan domestic species. The larvae breed in fruit and other decaying plant material
    • Weekly trap checks continue

Feb 08
    • Annual bulk re-supply shipment to Scott Base
    • 6 insects caught in field centre light traps, preliminary identification shows that these include two species of Drosophilidae 
    • Frequency of trap checks increased

Apr 08

    • 2 Flies caught in field centre light traps, these have not been identified

4. Non-native species diverted from transport to Antarctica

Following on from the recommendations of a New Zealand study on non-native species pathways and vectors (IP 36 2007), all fresh fruit and vegetables bound for Scott Base in the 2007/2008 season were inspected before they left the supplier’s premises and any soil, mould or invertebrates were removed. Figure 1 shows the number of fruit or vegetables that were diverted from delivery to Scott Base because they were affected by mould or harboured soil and the total number of invertebrates that were diverted from delivery over the 2007/2008 season.

Figure 1 - Number of fruit and vegetables affected by mould or that harboured soil and the number of invertebrates diverted from delivery to Scott Base

















We have able been able to use the results of the fruit and vegetable inspections to identify types of goods that had a higher incidence of being mouldy or harbouring invertebrates or soil.  Consequently, we have changed the way that we order fresh supplies and higher risk items are no longer ordered.


5. Summary

Over the last 12 months, New Zealand has experienced a significant incursion of vinegar flies (Drosophilidae) at Scott Base. The most persistent alien population was in the beer store. We have outlined the steps we have taken to manage the incursions and to improve our systems to prevent future incursions.

In addition to the fly incursion, the New Zealand programme has also inadvertently introduced a number of other non-native species to Scott Base and diverted many others.

We hope that this information will be useful to other national programmes, and that this kind of information sharing can help minimise future incursions of non-native species in Antarctica.
