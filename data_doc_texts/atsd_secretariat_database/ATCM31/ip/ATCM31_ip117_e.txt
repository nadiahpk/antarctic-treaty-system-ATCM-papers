Introduction

The Management Plan of the Admiralty Bay Antarctic Specially Managed Area, formally adopted by ATCM XXIX in 2006 (Measure 2), called for the establishment of a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the plan. The Management Group was established comprising representatives from Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Poland and USA. It is currently convened by Brazil.
The terms of reference for the Group are:
    • review the functioning and implementation of the Management Plan;
    • facilitate the communication among those working in or visiting the area;
    • monitor the Area to investigate possible sources of environment impact including cumulative impacts;
    • promote the dissemination of information on this Management Plan to all parties operating in the Area, and all other visitors to the Area;
    • maintain a record of activities in the Area.
To make the accomplishment of these management activities easier and to promote the exchange of information among the Parties operating in the area, Brazil has developed the Admiralty Bay ASMA website (www.admiraltybayasma.aq). 

Information Archive

The website includes the information described in the Management Plan; management activities; main permanent structures; maps; general information about the Area (e.g. geographical co-ordinates, earth science features, climate, flora, birds, mammals, marine ecosystem, and history); zones of scientific and ecological interest; general code of conduct and code of conduct for visitors.
It is also a valuable tool for the exchange of information about the activities conducted in the Area. There is information about:
    • logistical activities: stations, vessels, aircrafts, communication facilities; annual aircraft and vessel schedules and establishment of field camps.
    • scientific activities: permanent observatories, automatic recording stations and scientific projects developed. 
    • environmental activities: waste management, contingency plans, state of the environment report, monitoring activities; and
    • permits issued. 
Next step will be to include a discussion forum.
