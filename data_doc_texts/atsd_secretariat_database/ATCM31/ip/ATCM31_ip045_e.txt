On obtainment of permit to authorize  activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition for the period from 2008 to 2012 
In accordance with the accepted in Russia the activities of the Russian individual persons and legal entities in the Antarctic Treaty area should be carried out only on the basis of duly executed permits confirming conformity of the activity with requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Decision N 18.12.1997 of the Government of the Russian Federation). 
On August 1, 2002 the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) obtained the permit on the activities (Permit N 008) valid for 5-year period, until December 31, 2007.
During this period the RAE activity was based on the minimal allowable parameters set forth in the Decisions of the Russian Federation Government N 1113 of 28.08.97 “On the activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition” and N 685 of 24.09.2001 “On the measures to ensure the Russian Federation interests in Antarctica and on the activity of the Russian Antarctic Expedition in 2002 – 2005”on the working lines of the first and second stages of subprogram “Research and investigation of Antarctica” of the Federal Target Program “World Ocean”. 
Environment Impact Assessment of the RAE activities performed in compliance with the Annex 1 to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol) in the Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) format was submitted by the Russian Federation delegation to the XXV Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), convened in Warsaw, Poland, 2002 (ATCM Working Paper N 15).
The need to perform a new IEE of the RAE activity for the next 5 years (2008-2012) was dictated on one hand by the current Permit the validity expire and on the other hand – by the new scope of the RAE activities within 2006 to 2010, the main research lines of which were specified by the Russian Federation Government Order N 713-p of 02 June 2005 and by arrangements of the third stage of subprogram “Research and investigation of Antarctica” of the Federal Target Program “World Ocean”.
Previously the AARI and other organizations of the Russian Federation obtained 11 more Permits, related to the RAE activities, as follows: 
N 010 of  March 4, 2003. Experimental transport flights of IL-76 TD-type aircraft to the snow/ice aerodrome Russian Antarctic Novolazarevskaya station;
N 011 of  March 4, 2003. Reconstruction and use of snow/ice aerodrome at Novolazarevskaya station;
N 014 of  November 27, 2003. Construction of Russian Orthodox church at Russian Antarctic Bellingshausen base;
N 017 of February 13, 2004. Construction of wintering complex and of snow/ice runway at Antarctic Progress station;
N 022 of January 20, 2005 Restoration and removal of AN-3T aircraft out of Antarctic Treaty area;
N 024 of January 20, 2005. Aviation resupply of continental Vostok station;
N 025 of January 20, 2005. Further drilling of 50 meters of ice core in deep 5G-1 hole at Vostok station;
N 033 of November 7, 2005. Trial flight of IL-76 transport aircraft to Vostok  station to arrange cargo paradrop;
N 034 of November 7, 2005. Trial flight of IL-76 transport aircraft to snow/ice aerodrome at Novolazarevskaya  station;
N 036 of February 3, 2006. Marine geophysic and geologic research, including multipath echo sounding, high-frequency echo profiling, low-frequency pneumo acoustic profiling, gravimetry, bottom rock sample dredging, sampling;
N 39 of November 20, 2006. Further drilling of 75 meters of ice core in deep 5G-1 hole at Vostok station;
Some of the above activities have been already finished, others – the regular ones were included into the new version of the RAE IEE for 2008 to 2012 period.
The RAE activities the under new optimal conditions is divided into three groups as follows:
    • Logistic operations: marine and aviation operations, cargo paradrop, on-ground transport operations, station activities, construction and use of aerodromes, capital development and building renovation;
    • Scientific and applied marine research: oceanographical, biological, hydrographical, geophysical research and environmental monitoring;
    • Scientific and applied continental research: cryosphere research, Vostok lake comprehensive research, on-ground biologic research, surface and free atmosphere, magnetosphere and ionosphere research, geological-geophysical research, environmental monitoring;
    • Environmental activities: installation of environmental equipment, waste management.
The transfer to the new parameters of the RAE activities changed not only the scope of well-established research and work of the RAE on the continent and adjacent Southern Ocean but even extended the pattern of its transport operations in Antarctica. So, in the long-term expedition program for 2008 to 2012 circumnavigation of R/V “Akademik Fedorov” is planned for 2007/2008, 2009/2010 and 2011/2012 seasons. The in-between seasons will be confined by the ship’s operations in the Indian Ocean sector of Antarctica (between Novolazarevskaya station and Leningradskaya base longitudes).
The extension of the RAE transport operation geography and the performance of  new seasonal research and work types dictated the introduction of extra environment descriptions of new activity areas. 
In 2008 – 2012 it is planned to resume the previously stopped activity of the RAE  in the areas as follows:
    • Enderby Land (Molodezhnaya field base);
    • MacRobertson Land (Soyuz field base);
    • Victoria Land (Leningradskaya base);
    • Marie Byrd Land (Russkaya field base)
The new IEE shows the types of activities carried out in the areas of traditional expedition locations as follows: the resuming of runway operations at Novolazarevskaya, Vostok, Mirny and Progress stations and at Molodezhnaya, Druzhnaya-4, Soyuz and Russkaya field bases; the long-term operations on the renovation of RAE infrastructure objects  in Antarctica; the start-up of new observation programs at the RAE stations and others.
To minimize the human impact it was developed an environment management plan based on the up-to-date environmental requirements for the personnel education, environment impact monitoring, ecological monitoring, waste management, introduction of modern treatment facilities, incinerators and compactors. New aviation operation requirements to comply with the Guidelines for the operation of aircraft near concentrations of birds in Antarctica, adopted at XXVII ATCM in 2004, were put in force.
The IEE for 2008-2012 was developed on the basis of the Guidelines recommended within the Antarctic Treaty System.
On the basis of description of activity types and activity area environmental state, the environment impact assessment of the RAE activities was made. 
From this analysis it is assumed that the most significant impact in terms of source quantities will be produced as a result of station activity and waste management and removal activities at the stations where secondary environmental contamination by litter, dust and incidental spills of used oil, stored in old, rusty drums, is possible. However, this impact will be confined by the station boundaries, i.e. within non-recoverable areas, within already existing environmental conditions.
The IEE indicates that all the considered activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition in Antarctica, both, being carried out now and planned to be carried out during 2008 to 2012, will have not more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
The Ministry for natural resources of the Russian Federation issued a favorable conclusion on the IEE and stated that the declared activity of the RAE in the framework of considered terms and presented types of activities can be carried out without the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE). Based on this conclusion the Roshydromet issued the Permit N 048 to authorize the activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition for the period up to the end of 2012. (The Document copy is attached)

Taking into consideration the favorable conclusion of the Ministry for natural resources of the Russian Federation on the submitted IEE, the Commission on consideration of applications for the activities of the Russian citizens and legal entities in the Antarctic issued the Permit to authorize the activities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition for the period up to the end of 2012 without the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) preparation.
