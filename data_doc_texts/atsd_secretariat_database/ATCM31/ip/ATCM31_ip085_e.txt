IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism
2007-2008 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2008-2009 Antarctic Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Introduction
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2007-2008 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. The preliminary information presented here includes all IAATO operators and some non-IAATO operations based on the best available knowledge at the time of preparation.
IAATO strives to include as detailed information as possible in the IAATO Antarctic tourism database, including for non-IAATO member activities as an accurate reflection of overall numbers, including detailed tourism data on all landing sites, will assist greatly in furthering the understanding of any potential cumulative impacts from these activities. IAATO welcomes any further details from National Authorities on non-IAATO tourist-related activities for inclusion here and in the database.
An update of this paper will be posted under information papers on www.iaato.org when further information becomes available, and full tourism statistics will be posted on www.iaato.org when finalized.

1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As with the 17 past seasons, IAATO membership continues to incorporate the majority of all Antarctic tour operators. This season the membership accounted for over 90% of all known operators. All IAATO operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National Authority.
A summary of IAATO member activities follows:
    • 261 clients participated in multi-day land-based expeditions in the continental interior, with IAATO’s one land-based operator; 
    • 32,198 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area -- of this total:
        ◦ 25,776 passengers landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area
        ◦ 692 passengers landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica
        ◦ 154 passengers sailed aboard yachts (sailing and motor) that carry 12 or fewer passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula
        ◦ 257 passengers participated in air/cruise voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula area and flew from South America to King George Island to embark a vessel and sail for six days, making landings;
    • 12,365 passengers traveled aboard large cruise vessels that were cruise-only, making no landings  in the Antarctic Treaty Area;
    • 178 clients took part in air-based visits to King George Island, flying from South America for ‘day’ visits only, with no overnights;
    • 270 passengers participated in over-flights from South America to the Antarctic Peninsula area.

1.2 Non-IAATO Operator’s Activities
    • 5,319 passengers traveled aboard two non-IAATO-operated vessels, landing passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Information was supplied to IAATO by the operator and by the National Authority;
    • 650 passengers traveled aboard one non-IAATO operated cruise-only vessel in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Information was supplied to IAATO from the operator and the National Authority;
    • 343 passengers participated in one over-flight to Antarctica from Australia. Information was supplied by the operator;
    • An unknown number of clients were carried by multiple non-IAATO operators for land-based expeditions in the Antarctic continent departing from South Africa. IAATO would welcome any detailed information on these expeditions;
    • According to various sources, an unknown number of passengers participated in visits to King George Island leaving from Punta Arenas. IAATO would welcome any detailed information on these expeditions;
    • An unknown number of passengers traveled on yachts (sailing and motor) that carry 12 or fewer passengers. Some of these are understood to have been unauthorized. IAATO would welcome any detailed information on these expeditions;
    • 1 tourist participated in a program offered by Uruguay at Artigas Station. Information was supplied to IAATO by Uruguay. 
    • It is understood that Government-supported tourist-related activities on ships and aircraft occurred. IAATO would welcome any further details from National Authorities on non-IAATO tourist-related activities for inclusion here and in the database.
    •  Both private and commercial activities were conducted where Advance Notification and Post Visit Reports have been, or will be, filed through National Authorities. IAATO would welcome copies of these Post Visit Reports for inclusion here and in the tourism database;
    • Several National Authorities did not require Environmental Impact Assessments and/or Post Visit Site Reports from commercial tourist operations to report on their activities. IAATO would welcome any detailed information on any tourist operations authorized by these National Authorities for inclusion here and in the tourism database. 

1.3   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities 
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for a minimum of eight years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the 1960’s. 
Appendices to this information paper provide further details of scope of the activities, including operators (IAATO and non-IAATO), vessels/aircraft, departures, passenger numbers and activities. The Appendices are as follows:
    • Appendix A: Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2007-2008;
    • Appendix B: A histogram illustrating estimated and actual tourism figures for seaborne and land-based passengers as compiled since the 1992-1993 season;
    • Appendix C: Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism 2008-2009.
Based on information returned to IAATO in annual reports or in the Post Visit Report Forms from the 2007-2008 season it is estimated that at least 32,637 passengers landed in the Antarctic on private sector seaborne, air and land-based expeditions. 
All but two of the known commercial tour operators during the 2007-2008 season were located in the States of Contracting Parties. In both these cases, the operators went through an authorization process with an Antarctic Treaty Party. 

1.4 Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that at least 94 different nationalities were represented in tourists who visited the Antarctic this season. Of those recorded on the Post Visit Report Forms, the majority (90%) came from 11 different countries (see Table 1) with the remainder compiled from 83 other nationalities. A complete report of all nationalities will be posted under tourism statistics on www.iaato.org.

2.0 Commercial Seaborne Tourism – IAATO Members and non-IAATO Operators
2.1 Seasonal Estimates
While the information given below is an accurate reflection of the data available, IAATO cautions users who compare data from year to year to look at the annual list of individual vessels and compare it to reports from Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties’ Exchange of Information.
IAATO can account for 32,198 passengers landed in the Antarctic Treaty Area from 49 commercially-organized tour vessels which made landings and IAATO member-operated yachts (sailing and motor) which reported their activities from October 2007 to March 2008. This number includes IAATO members and non-IAATO ship operators, but does not include non IAATO operator yacht (sailing and motor). This represents a 12% increase in passenger numbers over the 2006-2007 season where a total of 28,622 ship-based passengers were reported traveling aboard 47 commercially-organized tour vessels and small sailing vessels and/or yachts. Six IAATO members operated cruise only operations (no landings) accounting for 12,365 passengers. 
IAATO Members operated all but three of the tour vessels that sailed during the 2007–2008 season, all of which were capable of carrying more than 500 passengers. Since 2001, IAATO’s Bylaws have stated that IAATO vessels carrying more than 500 passengers cannot land passengers ashore and that stringent landing restrictions are placed on vessels carrying more than 200 passengers at specific landing sites due to environmental considerations. Resolution 4 (2007) further recommended Parties to discourage or decline to authorise tour operators that use vessels carrying more than 500 passengers from making any landings in Antarctica. Two of the vessels capable of carrying more than 500 passengers operated by non-IAATO ship operators landed passengers; however, only one of those vessels, on one voyage only, landed more than 500 passengers. The operators of both these vessels have since joined IAATO and will be operating as IAATO members during the 2008-2009 season having agreed not to carry over 500 passengers while making landings.

The vast majority of commercially-operated voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the six-month austral summer season (from mid-October to early April), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from Falklands/Malvinas, Punta Arenas, Puerto Williams, Puerto Montt, Valparaiso, Puerto Madryn, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. 
The six IAATO cruise-only vessels (Artemis, Azamara Journey, Prinsendam, Rotterdam, Star Princess and Topaz) operated by IAATO members carried more than 500 passengers each and visited the Antarctic Peninsula area for approximately 72-96 hours on each voyage. 
2.2 Commercial Tour Vessels Operating in 2007-2008
A full list of IAATO member operated commercial tour vessels which completed cruises to the Antarctic, including information on their registry, permitting authority and passenger capacity is given in Appendix A. In total there were 28 vessels carrying between 13 – 199 passengers and seven vessels carrying between 200-500 passengers (three of these operated with less than 200 passengers on a number of cruises), plus the six IAATO member operated cruise-only vessels.

Non-IAATO member operated commercial Antarctic tour vessels consisted of two vessels which landed passengers, and one vessel operated as cruise-only. Details of these vessels are also provided in Appendix A. 

Further information on IAATO member vessels can be found on www.iaato.org, under Membership Directory/Member Vessels page. 
2.3 Commercial Yachts (Sailing and Motor) and/or Private Luxury Yacht Activities including those operated by non-IAATO Members
Based on information received from IAATO member operated yachts (sailing and motor) it is known that at least 154 passengers were reported to have traveled to the Antarctic Treaty Area aboard 12 or more commercially-operated small sailing vessels and/or private yachts during the 2007-2008 season. For non-member operated vessels this information may be found under the Annual Exchange of Information submitted by each Antarctic Treaty Party who permits or authorizes the vessel or company. 
	IAATO member operated commercial yachts (sailing and motor) with fare-paying passengers include Pelagic, Pelagic Australis, Golden Fleece, Tooluka, Australis, Santa Maria Australis, Seal, Kotick, Xplore, Spirit of Sydney and Hanse Explorer.  In addition, Billy Budd and LadyM were private expeditions organized by an IAATO member company.

A partial list of non-member operated private luxury yachts, small ships and/or small sailing vessels visiting Antarctica during the 2007-2008 season is given in Appendix A. IAATO provided Berge Viking with the IAATO One Off Private Expedition Yacht Package1.  It is understood that in addition to those listed in Appendix A there were other vessels which had not been permitted or authorized, or were aware of the need to have applied for permission to their respective National Authority. IAATO would welcome further information and any Post Visit Reports from any of these operators. 

3.0 	IAATO Member Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Cruise Vessels
All activities are approved through the Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documentation submitted in advance of the season to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

3.1 Camping on the Peninsula
Five IAATO Members conducting traditional seaborne tourism to the Antarctic Peninsula offered short overnight stays in conjunction with the cruise. Camping provides an opportunity for tourists to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica, separate from being on the ship. Guides accompany each group ashore. This activity has taken place for at least ten years in the Peninsula region. 
Campsites are generally located at least 450 ft. (150 m) from nesting birds, including penguins, and located on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites, or organic debris might be covered. Each campsite is used for no more than a few nights per season. Toilets are taken ashore; human waste is returned to the ship and meals are eaten only on board the ship.
	
3.2 Climbing and Kayaking from Ships in the Peninsula Area
Climbing and/or kayaking activities took place from eight IAATO member operated vessels. Climbing and kayaking have proven to be successful activities for more than ten years in the Antarctic Peninsula area. 

3.3 SCUBA Diving
SCUBA diving took place from four IAATO member operated vessels. SCUBA diving in the Antarctic Peninsula has been undertaken for at least eight years.

3.4 Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
An ROV has been used by one IAATO Member for over six years. The ROV is used for educational purposes. Video footage is taken by the ROV and aired aboard ship for passengers to be able to experience first-hand the underwater sea life. 

3.5 Helicopter Operations 
Helicopter operations were conducted from two vessels operated by IAATO members during the 2007-2008 season. Helicopter operations for tourism purposes have taken place since the 1992-1993 season.

3.6 Hovercraft Operation
One IAATO Member used a Hovercraft in the Ross Sea area during the 2007-2008 season.

4.0	Commercial Land-based Tourism
4.1 	Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions 
IAATO founding-member Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below) operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the 22nd consecutive season. ALE managed a total of 261 clients, 53 Government and VIP personnel (from National Operators, research institutes and government agencies) accompanied by 86 staff and guides, and air crew. 
ALE employs experienced staff and guides, many of whom have worked previously at Patriot Hills and other locations to be visited (85% of all staff have previous Antarctic experience). Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in Antarctica. 
Activities included the operation of standard programs, organization and operation of expeditions, services for private expeditions and support for government activities. ALE’s operations included the following:

Aircraft Operations:
    • One Ilyushin-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, fuel, staff, guides and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills on a total of eighteen flights.
    • Two ski-equipped Twin-Otter aircraft were used for flights in Antarctica and to support medical evacuation throughout the Antarctic season. 

Tractor Traverse:
    • ALE supported a scientific tractor traverse to the South Pole and Pole of Relative Inaccessibility. A total of 3422 km were traversed, linking into the Norwegian-US Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica.

Patriot Hills Camp:
    • Patriot Hills Camp opened October 30, 2007, and closed January 30, 2008.

Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) were again deployed at locations up to 200 km inland from Patriot Hills to provide weather data.
4.1.2 Government Activity Supported by ALE
Requests from National Operators, research institutes and government agencies resulted in ALE providing support for over 53 scientists and logistic staff and a considerable number of flights and flight crews. For the second season, ALE provided a ski way for LC-130 Hercules (National Guard, USA). Research groups, government representatives and their logistic support visited Patriot Hills and were accommodated at the camp for varying periods. ALE hosted visitors from British Antarctic Survey (UK), National Science Foundation (USA), Korean Polar Research Institute (KORDI), Centro de Estudios Científicos, Chile (CECS), Exeter University (UK), FACH (Chilean Airforce), Ejercito de Chile (Chilean Army), and Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil de Chile (DGAC).

ALE supported a privately funded scientific traverse by CECS to the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility via the Geographic South Pole. CECS also used ALE aircraft to visit Recovery D sub-glacial lake at 84° 39'S 20° 11’E during the traverse. The tractor traverse left Patriot Hills on December 22, 2007, and returned on January 27, 2008, having travelled 3422 km. A range of scientific objectives were achieved including shallow snow cores, shallow and deep radar measurements, determination of gravity and crustal structure and detailed surface topography. On January 12, 2008, members of the traverse met the Norwegian-US Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica at 86.05° S 55.06° E and later the two tractor routes crossed to provide a continuous scientific line of observations.

ALE supported a meteorite search organized by KORDI in the Thiel Mountains, providing flight, overland and field safety support for the group. The project was successfully completed. ALE also provided flight and overland support for a successful geomorphological investigation of the Shackleton Range by a group from Exeter University, UK.

4.2 Air/ Land-based Activities Conducted in Antarctic Peninsula
4.2.1 Destination Management Chile (IAATO Associate Member)
In 2007-2008 IAATO member Destination Management Chile operating through DAP, conducted six day-trips from Punta Arenas to King George Island. Fifteen trips were originally planned but were cancelled due to weather conditions either in Punta Arenas or at King George Island. Forty maximum passengers were escorted on station visits and on extended walks. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers calling at Punta Arenas.
4.2.2 DAP (non-IAATO Operator)
Aerovias DAP also completed an unknown number of flights carrying an unknown number of clients, including station personnel on station visits and extended walks. DAP offered both a one-day flight seeing and landing at King George Island and an overnight program where clients fly from Punta Arenas, Chile and stay on King George Island in DAP’s land-based facilities. Clients accompanied by a guide visit Frei/Marsh, Bellingshausen and Great Wall Stations, and nearby wildlife areas if time permits. 
DAP affiliate company AeroRescate also facilitated eight medical evacuations for IAATO members.
4.3	Air/Land-based Activities Conducted in Dronning Maud Land
At least two operators, The Antarctic Company and White Desert,  are offering tours to Dronning Maud Land. An unknown number of clients were flown on an airlink from South Africa to Dronning Maud Land. IAATO would welcome any detailed information on these expeditions to include in this report and the IAATO tourism database.



5.0	Air Operations – Overflights 
5.1 Over-flights from South America
IAATO member Destination Management Chile operating through IAATO member LAN Airlines conducted 6 over-flights carrying 270 cruise ship passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area in an Airbus-319, each flight with a maximum of 60 passengers during the 2007-2008 season. 

The flying routes varied according to weather conditions but basically were conducted as follows:

    • From King George Island to Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and Deception Islands (South Shetland Islands) and return.
    • From King George Island and the Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell Sea (in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands) near Marambio Station and return.

Numerous over-flights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate or have operated from Punta Arenas, but information on these flights prior to 2003-2004 has been difficult to obtain. 

5.2 Over-flight from Australia
During the 2007-2008 season non-IAATO operator Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia, operated one Antarctic daytime over-flight. 

The Quantas Airways Boeing 747-400 flight lasted approximately 11-12 hours in duration. A total of 343 clients participated in this flight, plus an additional 23 crew members. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 82 flights carrying nearly 29,500 clients since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The flight itineraries primarily operate along the northern Victoria Land Coast, and the Oates, George V and Adélie Coasts. Croydon’s staff provides a full in-flight lecture and education program utilizing at least three experienced lecturers and at least six videos. A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground-to-air interviews are conducted with staff members at Australian and occasionally at Italian bases.

6.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2008-2009 Season
Appendix C illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that are projected for the 2008-2009 season. The estimate is based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat at the time this report was submitted. 
For the 2008-2009 season seaborne or ship-based tourism will once again include the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B, Naiad, hovercraft, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA, diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV.
6.1 IAATO Member Activity
According to estimates provided to IAATO by members, 29,688  seaborne and yacht (sailing and motor) passengers are expected to land in Antarctica from commercially-organized vessels and 460 on air or land-based expeditions during the 2008-09 season. Another 11,400 are anticipated on cruise-only programs and 400 on over-flights (see Appendix C.)

6.2 Non-IAATO Operator Activity
IAATO has limited information on the activities of non-IAATO operators. Activities of non-Members continue to be of concern to IAATO, particularly with respect to yachts (sailing and motor, commercial and private) and land-based operations.  

Non-IAATO operator Aerovias DAP is planning on flying passengers from Punta Arenas to Frei/Marsh Station on King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at Frei/Marsh. 

Non-member Croydon travel intends to operate one overflight carrying an estimated 350 passengers (see Appendix C).

	IAATO has not been informed of possible activities in Dronning Maud Land during the 2008-2009 season.

Some National Operator vessels carry fare-paying passengers for tourist-related activities. National Programs are encouraged to co-ordinate with IAATO three months in advance of the season to ensure the principle of not more than one ship at one site at one time. In addition they are encouraged to report their passenger numbers and activities if they are landing at typical tourist sites so IAATO can include this data in its reporting of tourism statistics and in the database landing information as this is critical for management and monitoring for potential cumulative impact .

    7.0 Antarctic Tourism Trends

A trends chart showing the change in tourism from the 1992-1993 season to the 2007-2008 season, with an estimate for the 2008-2009 season, can be found in Appendix B of this paper.  

The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (http://www.iaato.org) under the category of “Tourism Statistics”: 

    • Tourists by Nationality (Landed)
    • Tourists by Nationality (Air and Cruise)
    • Tourists by Nationality (All)
    • Tourist Nationalities by Vessel
    • Trends 1992-2007
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per site per vessel-All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per Site per Vessel-Continental Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site per Vessel
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-Peninsula Sites 
    • Number of Visits per Site per Activity.

These datasheets will be posted once the statistics have been finalized.
	
8.0 Conclusion
In practice, and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether Members of IAATO or not – will be included in the exchange of emergency contact information, ship scheduling and in the reporting of tourist-related statistics. IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent so that complete and effective reporting can provide a strong base for tourism regulation by Treaty Parties and management by IAATO.
Preliminary indications for the 2008-09 season imply that Antarctic tourism may see a decrease in seaborne and land-based activities. IAATO remains committed to effectively managing Antarctic tourism and as an organization is focused on minimizing environmental impacts and consequently evaluates all relevant tourist activities. Despite the increase in numbers of visitors during this past season, IAATO believes that member activities continue to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
