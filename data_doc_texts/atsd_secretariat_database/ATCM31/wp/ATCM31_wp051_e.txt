Developing a Strategic Vision of Antarctic Tourism for the next Decade

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Summary

This paper proposes that the ATCM should develop a Strategic Vision for the development of Antarctic Tourism over the next decade.  Such a vision should aim to articulate a shared desire for the overall volume, geographic limits and diversity of tourism activities in Antarctica.  Given the continuing expansion of the Antarctic Tourism Industry, the UK proposes that such a vision be developed in time for ATCM XXXII, to form part of the celebrations of the 50th Anniversary of the signing of the Antarctic Treaty. 


Background

    1. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) has noted with concern the rapid increase in the growth and diversification of tourism activities in Antarctica over the past decade. The number of tourist landings in Antarctica has more than trebled in the last 10 years (ATCM XXIX IP/086 and ATCM XXX IP/121 Rev 1).  Cruise only passengers have trebled in the past three years.  In introducing their Overview of Antarctic Tourism at ATCM XXX, IAATO noted the importance of looking at the spread of activities in which tourists now engage (ATCM XXX Final Report, para 143).

    2. In response to the increasing volume and range of tourist activities, the ATCM has adopted a suite of Measures and Resolutions to further enhance the provisions within the Environmental Protocol that apply to all activities undertaken in Antarctica.  In the past three years, these have included new requirements for search and rescue and insurance cover (Measure 4(2004)), as well as the introduction of Site Guidelines (Resolutions 5(2005), 2(2006) and 1(2007)), and the discouraging of landings from larger passenger vessels (Resolution 4(2007)), or other activities which may degrade the Antarctic environment (Resolution 5(2007).

    3. However, whilst these newer Measures and Resolutions have been important additions to the suite of requirements within the Environmental Protocol, they have largely focused on the conduct of tourism within Antarctica.  To date, there has been little discussion about whether the Treaty Parties should place greater controls on the overall size, geographic limits and diversity of tourism activities in Antarctica.


Developing a Strategic Vision for Tourism Activities

    4. During the past year, the UK has discussed options for developing a Strategic Vision of Tourism in Antarctica with both Governmental, NGO and industry colleagues and has found general support for the overall concept.  Most recently, at the meeting organised by IAATO in Miami in March 2008, there was general agreement that a more proactive approach to designing the scope and development of tourism would be beneficial, both for the ATCM and for the tourism industry.

    5. The aim of developing a Strategic Vision would be that it would be aspirational and non-mandatory.  This would enable the vision to be kept under review and developed in light of external factors (such as global tourism trends, technological advances etc).  But the aim of articulating a shared ATCM vision of tourism would be that it would then enable the Parties to focus discussions on what Measures or Resolutions are required in order to deliver the objectives of the vision.  In addition, this may also increase the likelihood of proposals achieving consensus at ATCM.

    6. The UK would propose that the development of the vision includes both general principles for the overall development of tourism in Antarctica and then aim to articulate, as far as is practicable, more precisely what volume and form of tourism Parties would wish to see in the future.  The key objective here is that the ATCM takes a pro-active approach to determining how the tourism industry should develop over the next decade, rather than ad hoc responses to the phenomenal expansion of the industry over the past 10 years. Essentially the aim of the vision would be to articulate:

    • What the ATCM would wish tourism activities in Antarctica to look like – in terms of, for example, volume, geographic and seasonal limits and diversity;
    • How tourism in Antarctica will be managed to deliver such a vision; and 
    • How information about tourism activities will be collected, analysed and reported; and how the Antarctic environment will be monitored to identify any potential impacts of tourism activities.

    7. An example of the types of issues to be included in such a vision is attached to this paper.  This includes both statements and questions.  These are not intended to set or define limits or parameters for the vision, but simply to provide an illustrative list of some of the topics or issues that the ATCM may wish to consider in detail, once the concept of a vision has been agreed.   For ATCM XXXI, the UK is proposing simply to seek agreement to the concept of developing such a vision.  Parties will then wish to consider how to take forward the detailed development of the vision – either at ATCM XXXI or intersessionally.

Elements for Consideration in Developing a Strategic Vision for Antarctic Tourism over the next Decade

 
Overall Principles for Antarctic Tourism

The overall objectives would include general principles for development of tourism in Antarctica, for example:

    • Antarctic tourism will be conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible way;
    • The protection of the Antarctic environment is paramount – Tourism Activities in Antarctica will have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment;
    • Antarctica is not a place for “mass tourism”, to ensure that the intrinsic values of Antarctica, including the aesthetic and wilderness significance, are sustained.

Specific Objectives

This section should articulate more clearly the shared vision of the ATCM for future tourism activities in Antarctica i.e. what it should look like in terms of volume, geographic limits and diversity.  The following examples are meant simply to illustrate possible options and pose questions for future discussion:

Overall Growth in Tourism Activities in Antarctica:

    • Is the current year on year growth of Antarctic tourism of concern to the ATCM (either overall, or within specific regions)? 
    • Does the ATCM share a vision on whether limits should be set for the overall numbers of non-Governmental and non-scientific visitors to specific regions of Antarctica each year?
    • Should the ATCM set an agreed date for the commencement and ceasing of the tourism season each year?

Environmental Management:

    • Should the ATCM set a work-plan for the CEP to develop criteria for assessing and monitoring sites visited by tourism?
    • Within the next 10 years, should we aim to ensure that the most heavily visited sites are either designated as Antarctic Specially Managed Areas or have Site-specific Guidelines?

Authorising Tourism Activities:

    • Should there be a greater consistency between Competent Authorities’ requirements prior to activities being undertaken in Antarctica?
    • Will there be an accreditation scheme for tourism operators in place in the next 10 years?  Should such a scheme be used as a pre-requisite for undertaking activities in Antarctica?
    • Should there be an international scheme for observers for tourism activities?
    • Should there be co-ordinated and more systematic inspections of tourism activities in Antarctica?

Defining the form of tourism to be undertaken in Antarctica:

    • Should the ATCM develop a vision for the form of tourism that should be taking place in Antarctica over the next decade, including specifying which types of activities should be prohibited from being undertaken in Antarctica?
    • In respect of ship-based tourism, notwithstanding the current work within the IMO, should the ATCM develop a vision about the type of ship-based tourism to be undertaken in Antarctica, including, for example:
    • Should there be defined geographic areas of operation for different types of shipping activities (cruise only, yachts, landing etc)?  
    • Should limits be placed on the number of vessels of differing types of operation within specific regions at any time?
    • Should there be a limit on the number of passengers travelling on any ship visiting Antarctica?
    • Should there be environmental management training requirements for all crew and Expedition Leaders on-board ships visiting Antarctica?
    • Is the ATCM able to define more precisely what form of tourism may take place on land in Antarctica?
    • Should the ATCM set more specific parameters for tourism over-flights in Antarctica, including for example, defining regions in which such activities may take place and the desirable volume of such flights in each season?
    • For independent expeditions, should the ATCM articulate what kinds of activities should, or should not, be permitted in Antarctica? Should there be specific limits on the numbers of people authorised to undertake certain activities in specific regions at any one time (e.g. around the Pole)?  Should there be specific environmental training requirements for independent expedition activities?

Management and Monitoring of Tourism Activities

    • Should all tour operators be required to contribute funding to the management and monitoring of tourism within Antarctica (noting that the majority currently do so through IAATO)?
    • Should the management of tourist ship traffic in Antarctica continue to managed by the industry?  What would happen if the industry was no longer able to undertake such a function?
    • Should the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat be tasked with compiling tourism information for the ATCM by analysing Post Visit Site Reports?
    • How will potential impacts from tourist activities be monitored?  Should there be more consistency to the pre and post visit requirements placed on tour operators in this context?

As set out above, these questions and headings are designed to be strictly illustrative.  The aim is to identify those areas on which the ATCM can articulate a shared vision and those areas where further specific discussion is needed.  Once the overall vision is in place, work can then begin on how to ensure delivery of the vision (e.g. though Measures, Resolutions, industry by-laws or other means).
