Quantifying Atmospheric Emissions in Antarctic Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations 






Quantifying Atmospheric Emissions in Antarctic
Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations 
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

1. Introduction
1.1. An analysis was undertaken of the types of atmospheric emissions estimated in Final Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEE), and the methodology used to quantify such emissions. Fifteen Final CEEs produced since 1989 were examined. The Final CEEs were largely made available through the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat website (http://www.ats.aq/index_e.htm). 
1.2. The Final CEEs examined in this study are listed in Table 1:

2. Summary of Findings
2.1. All Final CEEs produced since the entry into force of the Environment Protocol in1998 have provided some estimates for emissions whereas no Final CEE prior to 1998 attempted to quantify emissions.  However the Protocol itself has no specific requirement for the reporting of atmospheric emissions.
2.2. Of the 10 Final CEEs produced since 1998, nine have included estimates for a total of 16 types of emissions (chemical species, or variations of). Typically, Final CEEs estimate four to seven types of emission (see Table 2). 
2.3. The exception to this is the Final CEE for Project Ice Cube, which reports on a total of 43 constituent air pollutants, listed under four categories (characteristic air pollutants, volatile organics, semi-volatile organics, and metals).
2.4. No two Final CEEs have reported on the same suite of emissions although the most frequently reported emissions are CO and NOx . 
2.5. The factors used to calculate emissions vary, and a number of Final CEEs do not cite the source of the emission factors used for the calculation. Sources for emission factors which are cited include: 
    • US Environmental Protection Agency : Office of Air and Radiation  Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors 
    • UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, Department for Environment and Rural Affairs
    • International Maritime Organisation 
    • Equipment Manufacturers performance data sheets (e.g. generators, vehicles)
    • Industrial Institutions ( e.g. Institute for Motor Vehicle Research)
2.6  In view of the above it may be helpful if the CEP were to determine what work has been carried out in this area by other relevant expert bodies and to consider how this might be applied in Antarctica to assist the development of a more standardised approach to calculating emissions in CEEs.  It will, of course, be important not to duplicate ongoing studies or discussions in other international bodies or fora.   For example, as the IMO is actively engaged in considering emissions from shipping the ATCM/CEP should not consider this aspect until IMO concludes its own work in this area.   
3. Recommendations
To assist Parties compiling Final CEEs, and to develop a common understanding of emission reporting in CEEs, the CEP is invited to consider whether there is merit in:
    • identifying an agreed list or types of emissions to be reported on in all CEEs;   
    • developing and/or adopting a standard approach to calculating emissions related to fossil fuel combustion based on existing agreed international standards.

If the CEP agrees this approach the UK would be willing to prepare, in conjunction with interested Parties, a more detailed paper for consideration at CEP XII or any other relevant intersessional meeting.
