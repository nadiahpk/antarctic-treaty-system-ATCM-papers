Annex II: Proposals for Completing the Review



Annex II: Proposals for Completing the Review
Working Paper submitted by Australia

Introduction
This paper responds to discussion at the 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXX, 2007) about the review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  
The paper proposes the adoption of specific amendments to the Annex.  These proposals were in the revision referred by CEP to ATCM XXVII (2004) as Appendix 9 to the CEP VII Final Report. 
Appendix A to this Working Paper summarises deliberations on this matter at earlier meetings, to provide background to the discussion.
This paper should be read in conjunction with the Australian Information Paper Review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection submitted to this meeting, which provides:
    1) background to the CEP’s discussion of suggested amendments;
    2) a summary of any subsequent discussions by the ATCM; and
    3) Australia’s suggestions for addressing the proposed amendments.
Amendments proposed
    1. Inclusion of invertebrates in relevant provisions throughout.
Although Article 1(d) provides a definition for “native invertebrate”*, the only provisions applicable to invertebrates are in Article 1(h)(vi) on significant adverse modification of species or populations of native invertebrates, and Article 6 on Exchange of Information. On advice from SCAR, the CEP agreed that invertebrates should also be addressed in other relevant provisions. This is because, from a scientific and conservation point of view, there is no justification for affording native invertebrates a lesser level of protection than that generally applicable to native plants, seals and birds.
The proposed amendments would have the result of incorporating invertebrates within:
    • the definitions of “take” or “taking” and “harmful interference”, and relevant provisions relating to issuing permits for those purposes (these provisions do not apply to individual invertebrates, but rather to “such numbers of invertebrates”); 
    • the provisions for reporting emergencies; and 
    • the provisions for designating and protecting Specially Protected Species.
* “native invertebrate” means any terrestrial or freshwater invertebrate, at any stage of its life cycle, indigenous to the Antarctic Treaty area.
    2. Inclusion of references to criteria and procedures for designating and managing Specially Protected Species.
Article 3.4 provides for the designation of species as Specially Protected Species, and Appendix A contains species so listed, but the Annex does not define any criteria or procedures by which species should be listed or delisted, nor does it describe what management or protection measures should be taken once a species is designated.  This is important to ensure the consistent and proper application of the Specially Protected Species mechanism, and to provide previously absent guidance on the conservation actions designation should trigger.
The proposed amendments would have the result of requiring that species be designated according to agreed criteria and procedures, and that management or protection measures be developed with the advice of the CEP. This reflects the standard approach to species protection elsewhere in the world. Advising on these matters is a natural role for the CEP and in 2005 it adopted Guidelines for CEP Consideration of Proposals for New and Revised Designations of Antarctic Specially Protected Species under Annex II of the Protocol.  These guidelines were endorsed by the ATCM (see ATCM XXVIII Final Report, para 82).
    3. Enhanced provisions to prevent the unintentional introduction of non-native species and disease.
The provisions in Appendixes B & C to Annex II, addressing the permitted importation of plants and animals and measures to prevent unintentional introductions need enhancement, because with climate warming and increasing visitation, the Antarctic is not quarantined from the significant harmful effects that introduced non-native species and disease are having on species, habitats, ecosystems and biodiversity worldwide. During recent discussions of this matter, and in discussions on its strategic directions, the CEP identified quarantine and non-native species as the highest priority for attention. 
The proposed amendments would have the result of drawing the content of Appendixes B and C into the main body of the Annex, clarifying the requirements for permissible importations, introducing an obligation for appropriate response to unintentional introductions, and generally updating provisions and terminology to reflect current scientific understanding.
    4. A range of other minor but technical and editorial amendments.
The proposed amendments would have the result of:
    • making minor grammatical amendments and consequential drafting amendments;
    • updating terminology to reflect current scientific understanding, such as: removing references to parasites, which are a functional – not taxonomic – category; and amending the requirement to check dressed poultry for certain diseases which are only detectable in living birds;
    • deleting outdated provisions requiring the removal of dogs from Antarctica;
    • modifying the dates for reporting of information under Annex II, to reflect current reporting practice under Resolution 6(2001).
Recommendations
    1) That the ATCM adopt the above proposed amendments with a view to finalising the review at this Meeting.
    2) That, if these proposals are not adopted and to facilitate consideration at a future meeting, the ATCM clearly record in its report areas where agreement is reached, where agreement is not reached, and where a Party  requests more information about a particular amendment.
Appendix A. Summary of ATCM and CEP discussions on the review of Annex II
2001: CEP IV / ATCM XXIV
    • The CEP agreed to start a rolling review of the Annexes to the Protocol and, noting issues raised in ongoing intersessional consideration of Specially Protected Species, decided to commence with a review of Annex II (see CEP IV Final Report para 6).
    • The ATCM endorsed the CEP’s proposal, recognising that “amendment of the annexes, to reflect changing environmental conditions and practices, had been inherent in the original design of the Protocol as a framework document with attached Annexes” (see ATCM XXIV Final Report para 41).
2002: CEP V / ATCM XXV
    • Two Working Papers were submitted to CEP V on the review of Annex II (WP7 Annex II: Reasons for a Review, Argentina; and WP37 Comments on the Revision of Annex II, SCAR).
    • The CEP established an intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) convened by Argentina to advance the review of Annex II (see CEP V Final Report paras 51-55).
    • ATCM XXV welcomed the commencement of the CEP’s review process (see ATCM XXV Final Report para 67).
2003: CEP VI / ATCM XXVI
    • Argentina presented to CEP VI WP25 Progress Report of the CEP Intersessional Contact Group on Annex II, reporting on the first round of ICG discussions.
    • The CEP considered several issues raised in the report and agreed the ICG should continue its work and provide a final report to CEP VII (See CEP VI Final Report paras 63-105).
    • The ATCM noted the work of the ICG and CEP to date. It discussed a question from the CEP about whether a change to the title of Annex II (to “Conservation of Antarctic Living Organisms”) would be permissible but did not reach consensus on the matter, which the Chair urged parties to consider for discussion at ATCM XXVIII (see ATCM XXVI Final Report paras 68 & 69).
2004: CEP VII / ATCM XXVII
    • The CEP considered two Working Papers prepared following the second round of intersessional discussions on the review of Annex II: WP17 Final Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Annex II Review (Argentina) and WP22 Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (United Kingdom). Each paper presented a suggested revised version of the Annex.
    • The CEP was unable to reach consensus on all areas of difference between the two versions, and referred to the ATCM for consideration a version with square bracketed alternatives where consensus agreement could not be reached. This version was included as Appendix 9 to the CEP VII Final Report (see CEP VII Final Report paras 88-100).
    • The ATCM noted the CEP’s review had resolved a number of technical matters but that some policy matters of a more substantial nature remained to be addressed, including: whether the title of the Annex should be amended and, if so, whether its scope would be extended; if the definitions in Article 1 should be modified; and whether to extend the designation of Specially Protected Species to include marine species. The Meeting agreed to refer the topic for further consideration at ATCM XXVIII (see ATCM XXVII Final Report paras 81-85).
CEP VIII / ATCM XXVIII (2005)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP VIII.
    • The ATCM only briefly discussed the review of Annex II and agreed to revisit the matter at ATCM XXIX (see ATCM XXVIII Final Report para 81).
CEP IX / ATCM XXIX (2006)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP IX.
    • The CEP Chair presented a non-paper (a re-formatted version of Appendix 9 to the CEP VII Final Report) and participated in the Legal and Institutional Working Group’s discussions of Annex II. The outcomes of discussions by the Legal and Institutional Working Group were reflected in a Working Paper produced during the meeting by the United Kingdom, WP 44 Review of Annex II of the Environmental Protocol. That paper provided a draft revised text of Annex II, based on Appendix 9 to the ATCM XXVII Final Report, amended to delete proposed references to the term “Antarctic Living Organisms”.
    • Some delegations felt that the advice from the CEP was insufficient to enable the Meeting to arrive at a conclusion and that further technical and scientific work was needed. Other delegations noted that the advice of the CEP, though comprehensive, did not reflect a consensus. The Meeting noted, however, that the advice of the CEP need not be consensual. Some delegations did not believe that Annex II should be remitted back to the CEP. It was decided that this issue would need to be discussed at ATCM XXX (see ATCM XXIX Final Report paras 43-45).
CEP X / ATCM XXX (2007)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP X.
    • The ATCM considered three papers on the review of Annex II: WP19 On Review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (Russian Federation); IP137 Re-Issue of WP 44 (ATCM XXIX) Review of Annex II of the Environmental Protocol (United Kingdom); and IP81 Amendment or Modification of Annex II and the Implications for Further Annex Review (ASOC).      
    • There was considerable discussion in a contact group of the Legal and Institutional Working Group, which worked through the CEP’s proposed amendments article by article up to Article 4.3, but this did not result in agreement on any matters by the Working Group or the Meeting.
    • Views expressed during discussion of the matter included that:
    • the review of Annex II had continued for a long period and the review should be completed at the present meeting;
    • some technical aspects of Annex II could be improved, but negotiation and entry into force of revisions could take a long time and the benefit might be limited compared to other possible avenues of protection;
    • further scientific background to the review was desirable; further scientific input was not needed and that what was required was a legal and policy perspective; and
    • explanations of proposed amendments to Annex II would be desirable. 
    • The Meeting agreed to return to the issue of Annex II at ATCM XXXI (see ATCM XXX Final Report paras 39-43).
