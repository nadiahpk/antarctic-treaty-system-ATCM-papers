A Proposed Checklist for Inspecting Specially Protected and Managed Areas in Antarctica






A Proposed Checklist for Inspecting Specially Protected and Managed Areas in Antarctica

Working Paper submitted by New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America

Background
At the ninth meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP IX), New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States presented a draft checklist for inspecting protected areas in Antarctica (ATCM XXIX /WP 33).  In discussing the matter, a number of Parties raised questions regarding the intended use of the checklist.  The Committee agreed to revisit the matter at CEP X at which time the proponent parties noted that they would bring a revised version for consideration at CEP XI (paras 174 and 175 from the Final Report of CEP IX and para 309 from the final report of CEP X refer).  The paper has been reviewed in light of intersessional consultation and is resubmitted here for the CEP’s reconsideration.
Introduction
Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty states “In order to promote the objectives and ensure the observance of the provisions of the present Treaty, each Contracting Party whose representatives are entitled to participate in the meetings referred to in Article IX of the Treaty shall have the right to designate observers to carry out any inspection provided for by the present Article”.
In addition Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty provides that inspections shall be arranged “in order to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, and to ensure compliance with this Protocol”.
In 1995, ATCM XIX agreed that inspection checklists would provide useful guidelines for those planning and conducting inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty.  ATCM XIX therefore adopted Resolution 5 (1995) to which the following checklists developed by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) were appended:
    • Checklist A Permanent Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations
    • Checklist B Vessels within the Antarctic Treaty Areas
    • Checklist C Abandoned Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations
    • Checklist D Waste Disposal Sites

ATCM XIX also noted that “these checklists, which are not intended to be exhaustive, are designed to provide a guideline to observers conducting inspections in Antarctica in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty. Not all items in the checklists are necessarily applicable to the activity being inspected or directly related to Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty or the requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. It is recognised that some of the items could be addressed through the Antarctic Treaty Exchange of Information. It is also recognised that the purpose of an inspection is to verify through observation. Therefore, any inspection report should clearly identify which information was observed and which was taken from documents. It is recommended that observers seek out and examine all relevant documents prior to undertaking inspections including the Antarctic Treaty Exchange of Information.” ATCM XIX also noted that such checklists are not mandatory and should not be used as a questionnaire.

Checklist for inspecting Antarctic specially protected and managed areas
Annex V to the Protocol deals with area protection and management in Antarctica.  Article 10 of Annex V requires Parties to make arrangements for exchanging information on protected and managed areas.  Article 10(1)(a) states:

“The Parties shall make arrangements for:
Collecting and exchanging records, including records of permits and reports of visits, including inspection visits, to Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and reports of inspection visits to Antarctic Specially Managed Areas:” (underlining added).

Furthermore, Article 12 of the Protocol sets out the functions of the CEP, including the requirement for the CEP to “provide advice on (inter alia) inspection procedures, including formats for inspection reports and checklists for the conduct of inspections” (Article 12 (1)(h)).
Against this background, in November 2005, the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand undertook formal inspections of protected areas in the Ross Sea region.  A full report of those inspections was provided as a Working Paper to CEP IX and ATCM XXIX.
In order to assist those inspections, a draft checklist for inspecting specially protected and managed areas was prepared and was tested in Antarctica by inspecting five ASPAs and one ASMA.  The draft checklist is appended to this Working Paper.
In drafting the checklist, we drew upon those questions that are already used in Checklist A (Permanent Stations) and Annex V to the Protocol (notably Article 5 of Annex V, which sets out the requirements for management plans).  Section 20 of Checklist A includes eight points for protected areas in the vicinity of, or containing, the station in question.  We have also attempted to make the questions more generic so as to apply to all protected and managed areas irrespective of how close they are to stations or bases.
In carrying out the inspections during the 2005/06 season the draft checklist proved to be a useful tool.  The draft checklist provided a comprehensive summary of the issues for each protected area inspected as well as for the components of the ASMA that was inspected (the Dry Valleys ASMA).  Completed checklists for each site inspected also provided an adequate record for subsequent preparation of the final inspection report.
Proposal
We therefore propose that the CEP review the draft checklist and amend it as required.  We further propose that the CEP forward the draft checklist to the ATCM for approval so as to assist further protected and managed area inspections. In doing so the CEP may wish to seek the ATCM’s views as to whether the protected area component of existing Checklist A needs to be modified or removed. A draft Resolution is attached (Annex I). 

Annex I: Draft Resolution

Resolution X (2008)
Checklist to assist in the inspection of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas

The Representatives,
Recalling Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty which provides for the designation of observers to carry out inspections and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty which provides that inspections shall be arranged to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and to ensure compliance with the Protocol;
Further recalling Article 12 of the Protocol which sets out the functions of the Committee on Environmental Protection, including providing advice on inspection procedures, including formats for inspection reports and checklists for the conduct of inspections;
Considering that inspection checklists are useful as guidelines for those planning and conducting inspections;
Noting that checklists are not mandatory, exhaustive nor necessarily completely applicable to all areas and that they are not to be used as a questionnaire;
Recommend that:
Their Governments:
encourage the use of the attached “Checklist to assist in the inspection of Antarctic Specially Protected and Managed Areas”.

Therefore, any inspection report should clearly identify which information was observed and which was taken from documents. It is recommended that observers seek out and examine all relevant documents prior to undertaking inspections.
