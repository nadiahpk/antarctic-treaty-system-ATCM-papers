Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Performance Review

Working Paper submitted by New Zealand



At its 26th meeting the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) decided to undertake a Performance Review of CCAMLR (CCAMLR-XXVI Report, Annex 7 refers).  The Commission agreed that the Performance Review should be conducted in the 2007/08 intersessional period and that a final report should be submitted to Contracting Parties at CCAMLR XXVII, to be held in Hobart, Australia, from 27 October to 7 November 2008.
In recognition of the important linkages between the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and CCAMLR, and the fact that the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources is an integral part of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), the Commission has invited the Chair of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) to participate in the Review, ex officio, as one of the nine Review Panel members.
The Commission has also established a number of criteria to guide the Review Panel, including ‘the role of CCAMLR within the Antarctic Treaty System’ (Criteria 1) and incorporating environmental protection, conservation, protected areas and environmental marine management objectives, and inter alia the extent to which the Commission has made progress to respond to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) target to establish a representative network of marine protected areas by 2012.
At the ATCM XXIX in Edinburgh, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) adopted Resolution 1 (2006) on ‘CCAMLR in the Antarctic Treaty System’ and recommended that Parties to the Antarctic Treaty regularly at the ATCM reflect upon the contribution made by CCAMLR to the ATS, including in respect of the conservation and protection of the Antarctic environment, and encourage increased cooperation at the practical level between the ATCM and CCAMLR.
The invitation to the Chair of the CEP to participate in the CCAMLR Performance Review and the inclusion of Criteria 1 on the role of CCAMLR within the ATS present in New Zealand’s view a very good example of the increased level of cooperation between the ATCM and CCAMLR which the Parties encouraged in Resolution 1 (2006).  New Zealand considers that the CCAMLR Performance Review also presents a useful opportunity to review the relationship between the CEP and CCAMLR, and to assess in particular CCAMLR’s contribution to date towards the establishment of protected areas with a marine component in the Antarctic Treaty area, in accordance with Decision 9 (2005).
The attached draft resolution therefore welcomes CCAMLR’s decision at its 26th meeting to undertake a Performance Review and to invite the Chair of the CEP ex officio to participate in the Review Panel.  It also welcomes the inclusion of criteria in the Performance Review which deal with the role of CCAMLR within the ATS.  In addition, the draft resolution proposes that the Parties at ATCM XXXII reflect upon the report of the Performance Review Panel, including in particular the Panel’s comments on the implementation of Decision 9(2005).
