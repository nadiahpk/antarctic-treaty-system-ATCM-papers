Antarctic Climate Change Issues 
 

Introduction

    1. Antarctica is an integral component of the Earth system. It couples to global climate, sea level, biogeochemical cycles, ecosystems, and human activities. Through these connections, the Earth’s high latitudes respond to, amplify, and drive changes elsewhere. At a time when humans are exerting an increasing impact on the planet, and when the human condition is increasingly affected by global changes, the Polar Regions are especially important and relevant. The Parties need to consider what consequences the current knowledge about climate change and impact has or should have on management and governance of Antarctica. Moreover, the Parties need to consider how to manage their responsibility/obligation to bring forward and to communicate new knowledge on climate changes in Antarctica to the world. This knowledge could be vital to the international community’s effort to respond to the large challenges posed by climate change.

    2. ATCM XXX (2007) particularly recognised the importance of climate changes to Antarctica and the importance of Antarctica to the global climate:

    • CEP X (2007) added Climate Change as a sub-item under its agenda item on Environmental Monitoring and Reporting, (CEP X 2007 Final Report, Agenda Item 9).

    • ATCM XXX revised Agenda Item 13 to read as follows: Science Issues, Including Climate-Related Research, Scientific Co-operation and Facilitation, (ATCM XXX 2007 Final Report Item 13: Science Issues, particularly scientific co-operation and facilitation).


Follow-up of SCARs review report considering consequences of Antarctic climate change for the management and governance of Antarctica

    3. SCAR has provided one expert report based on existing knowledge about the physical dimensions of climate change in Antarctica (ATCM XXX IP 005) and is expected to deliver one based on existing knowledge about climate change and effects on biota in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean at ATCM XXXI. The Parties need to consider what consequences the current knowledge about climate change and its impacts have or should have on management and governance of Antarctica. 

    4. Changes in the climate are likely to have knock-on impacts for Antarctic activities, such as tourism, research, fishing etc. Therefore, in addition to avoiding and reversing climate change through reductions in global emissions of greenhouse gases, there is a need to ensure that we make the right management choices in light of the climate changes predicted for Antarctica. There may be a need to consider development of new management tools or new regulations.

    5. There is a need to explore the risks and uncertainties surrounding future climate change and to consider, and critically assess, the policy implications, issues and options related to these changes.


Strengthen co-operation in research – and environmental monitoring 

    6. Extensive knowledge on the consequences of climate changes to the Antarctic environment is a prerequisite for the Parties’ management of the Antarctic Continent. Extensive knowledge from the Antarctic Continent is also a prerequisite for the understanding of the major terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric systems that control the planet. 

    7. This is reflected in Resolution 3 (2007) on long-term scientific monitoring and sustained environmental observation in Antarctica. In it, the Parties are recommended to: 

1. Urge their national Antarctic programmes to maintain and extend long-term scientific monitoring and sustained observations of the Antarctic environment, 

2. Contribute to a co-ordinated Antarctic observing system network initiated during the IPY in co-operation with appropriate international bodies, and 

3. Support long-term monitoring and sustained observations of the Antarctic environment and the associated data management as a primary legacy of the IPY.

    8. The Parties to the Antarctic Treaty therefore have a responsibility to bring forward and to communicate new knowledge on climate changes in Antarctica, and the impacts of such changes on a global scale. 


Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from Antarctic activities

    9. Activities in Antarctica are resource intensive and the emission of greenhouse gases, relative to the number of people involved in the activities, is likely to be high (relative to the global average). Reduction of such emissions should be a focus for Antarctic operations, and new management tools and new regulations should be identified and encouraged, for example:

    • Alternative energy systems
Technologies related to cleaner energy production, to renewable energies and to energy storage are rapidly evolving and new (realistic) possibilities of alternative energy systems for Antarctic stations now arise. Alternative energy systems produce fewer harmful emissions that are detrimental to the environment, as well as the climate system. Although gains are small in the big picture, the symbolic value of focusing on this in Antarctica cannot be underestimated. 

    • Co-ordination of transport
Emissions from transportation in Antarctica are a major contributor to the Antarctic emissions of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Two main strategies could contribute to reduction of Antarctic transport emissions of greenhouse gases: technological changes to vehicles and fuels and increased transport co-operation and co-ordination.

    • Incorporate consideration of greenhouse gas emissions into the Environmental Impact Assessment process
All recently submitted CEEs have included an assessment of likely emissions associated with large-scale projects in Antarctica.  However, consideration should be given to formalising such a process within all CEEs, and other EIAs developed under the Environmental Protocol. 

    • Identification of best practices
Also other viable ways to reduce emissions, including identification of best emission reduction practices/technologies in all activities in Antarctica should be identified and encouraged. 

    • Development of an appropriate  regulatory framework
Consider whether an appropriate sui generis regulatory framework on emissions in Antarctica could be developed under the Environmental Protocol. 

Recommendations

    • Parties should ensure that Resolution 3 (2007)1 is followed up appropriately and extensively. Consideration should be given to whether Parties should report on a regular basis to CEP/ATCM on actions taken in this regard. Consideration should also be given to whether the ATS secretariat could assist the CEP/ATCM in maintaining a (web-based) record of such actions;

    • SCAR should be asked to keep the CEP updated on new knowledge on climate change and effects of climate change in Antarctica on an annual basis.  The CEP should present this information to the ATCM for their consideration as to the potential management implications;  

    • COMNAP should be asked to collect and disseminate experiences gained in Antarctica on alternative energy production, and on good practices/technologies that contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Antarctica, and report back to the CEP and ATCM XXXII;

    • National operators, and other operators as appropriate, should be strongly encouraged to increase efforts to co-operate and co-ordinate with respect to transportation in Antarctica to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. COMNAP should play an active role in facilitating such co-operation and co-ordination;

    • The CEP should develop a clear methodology for the calculation of emissions in Antarctica.  The CEP should also consider how such information can be incorporated into the EIA process (as set out in paragraph 9, third bullet above).  The CEP should then advise the ATCM on the development of an Antarctic Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, covering all activities undertaken in Antarctica;

    • An Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts should be convened in 2009 with the aim to assess the consequences of climate change in Antarctica for the management and governance of Antarctica and consider necessary practical and legal steps to meet these challenges. The reports from SCAR and other relevant information on climate change in the Antarctic should provide basis for discussions at such a meeting.
