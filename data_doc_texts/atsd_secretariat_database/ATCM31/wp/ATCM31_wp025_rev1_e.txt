Review of Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 
No.s 105, 118, 154, 155 and 156 

Working Paper submitted by New Zealand



Introduction

In accordance with the provisions Annex V, Article 6 (3) of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Resolution 1 (1998), New Zealand has initiated a review of the management plans for the following Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs):

    • ASPA 105, Beaufort Island, McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea;
    • ASPA 118, Summit of Mount Melbourne, Victoria Land;
    • ASPA 154, Botany Bay, Cape Geology, Victoria Land;
    • ASPA 155, Cape Evans, Ross Island; and
    • ASPA 156, Lewis Bay, Mount Erebus, Ross Island.  

The review processes for four of the ASPAs (118, 154, 155 and 156) have been completed and are described in this paper. It is proposed, subject to the views of the Committee, that these updated Management Plans be approved during ATCM XXXI, without further intersessional review.  Although it is not five years since a review of the management plan for ASPA 155 Cape Evans, some suggested changes have been made as the values of the Area are currently considered to be under threat.  

The review process for ASPA 105 has been initiated, but could not be completed as local sea ice conditions did not allow an inspection to take place in the 2007/08 season.  An inspection of the Area has been scheduled for the 2008/09 season, the results of which will be included in the revised management plan to be submitted to the ATCM XXXII.   



Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 118, Summit of Mt Melbourne, Victoria Land

    1) An area of 6 km2 on the summit of Mount Melbourne was originally designated in Recommendations XIV-5 (1987, SSSI No. 24, Summit of Mount Melbourne) and XVI-8 (1991 SPA No.22, Cryptogam Ridge, Mount Melbourne) after proposals by New Zealand and Italy on the grounds that these areas contain geothermal soils that support a unique and diverse biological community.  The warmest areas of ground created by fumaroles support patches of moss, liverwort and algae along with one species of invertebrate protozoan.  These grounds are still relevant.

    2) The expiry date of the original Management Plan for SSSI No. 24 was extended to 31 December 2000 through Resolution 3 (1996).   The expiry date was further extended through Measure 2 (2000).   The Area was re-named and re-numbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 118 through Decision 1 (2002). SPA 22 was re-named and re-numbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 118 through Decision 1 (2002) (note: under Resolution 5 (1996) both sites on Mt Melbourne were given the same ASPA number. However, these sites remained as separate areas). Measure 2 (2003) designated SSSI No. 24 and SPA 22 as ASPA 118.

    3) In the period since the last revision of the management plan for ASPA 118, research conducted in this Area has involved sampling of microorganisms, lichen and moss (Umbilicaria decusata and Bryum pseudotriquetrum), bacteria and soil. Italy has issued a number of permits for entry into the Area.  These have been issued for sampling, and radio repeater maintenance and control activity at a GPS base station. Four scientists have entered the ASPA to conduct sampling, 10 entries have been made for GPS measurements and at least 30 entries have been made for maintenance of the radio repeater.    Neither the United States nor New Zealand have issued any permits for entry.

    4) The consultation process involved contacting the Italian Programme for comment on the Management Plan for ASPA 118.  They were asked to gauge whether information in the Management Plan was still current and whether the values identified had changed since the last revision.  The values of the Area were considered more than sufficient to warrant special protection.

    5) There have been no substantial changes made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan. The boundaries, maps and descriptions of the Area remain the same as in the existing Management Plan.1

    6) There have been some minor changes to the existing Management Plan (all new text in italics) and these include:

Section 1. 
(First paragraph)
Added:
 “A new species of moss Pohlia nutans, very genetically similar to another species found on Mt Rittman, was discovered in 2002 in small mosses in the fumeroles on the NW slope of Mt Melbourne.” 
and
An entirely new species of thermophilic bacteria, Bacillus thermoantarcticus, has also been discovered on the summit (Manca et al 1996; Lama et al 1996, 2001; Nicolaus et al 2000, 2001, 2002), and some enzymes have been isolated from these microorganisms (Lama et al 2001, 2004, 2005; Nicolaus et al 2002, 2004).  Biochemical and microbiological studies have also been carried out on hot substrata in the area (Bargagli et al 2004; Pepi et al 2005).

Section 3. 	
(First bullet point)
Added: 
    • Information showing the location of the Area (stating the special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and a copy of this Management Plan shall be kept available, in all of the research hut facilities located within 25 km of the Area, and in the radio repeater equipment box on the summit of Mt Melbourne.

Section 6(iv).  
Added:
The nearest protected areas are: Edmonson Point ASPA No. 165, approximately 13km east of Mt Melbourne; Cape Hallett, Victoria Land ASPA No. 106 (SPA No. 7), approximately 300 km to the north; and, Botany Bay, Cape Geology, Victoria Land ASPA No. 164 (SSSI No. 37) approximately 300 km to the south.

Section 7.
(First sentence)
Added:  “s” to word “authoritie”

Section 7(i). 
(First bullet point)  
Added:  “in” to “with” to change to “within”

Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 154, Botany Bay, Cape Geology, Victoria Land

    1) Botany Bay was originally designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 37 in 1997 (Measure XXI-3) by New Zealand.  The Area was designated on the grounds that it contains rich and diverse lichen and moss communities at high latitude and abundant algae, invertebrate and south polar skua populations. In addition to biological values, the Area protects a rock shelter constructed by the 1910-1913 British Antarctic Expedition within a specially Managed Zone. These grounds are still relevant.

    2) The Area was re-named and re-numbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 154 through Decision 1 (2002).  The Management Plan for ASPA No. 154 was revised through Measure 2 (2003).

    3) Activity in the Area since the last review has included research focused on terrestrial biodiversity research.  New Zealand has issued 16 permits in the period since the last revision of the Management Plan for ASPA 154.  Neither the United States nor Italy have issued any permits for entry to this Area.

    4) The consultation process for the review of this Management Plan involved contacting New Zealand researchers who have knowledge of the Area, the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a tourism operator.  They were asked to gauge whether information in the Management Plan was still current and whether the values identified had changed since the last revision. The values of the Area were considered more than sufficient to continue protection of the Area.

    5) A number of substantial changes have been made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan. 

There has been a re-drawing of the Managed Zone boundary.  The Managed Zone now extends from the northwestern corner of the ASPA along the coast, and provides a small corridor of entry to Granite House.  This proposed zone will allow access to the historic site but will reduce the access area in which vegetation can be found thereby minimising potential damage to vegetation.

Access within the ASPA (outside the Managed Zone), for conservation visits to historic sites, has been allowed for. To the west of Granite House is a tent site established by the Western Geological Party under Griffith Taylor.  A number of artefacts have been removed from this site for conservation but it is possible that some artefacts remain around this site that may warrant visits to the ASPA for conservation purposes.

The maps have also been substantially changed.  The three maps being submitted as part of this review have all been revised to include a layer showing vegetation density within the Area.  They also depict the new Managed Zone boundary.  Map C depicts the density of the three different vegetation types in the Area.

    6) A number of minor changes (all new text in italics) have been made to the existing Management Plan and these include:



Section 1.

This area is outside the Managed Zone and is subject to access restrictions.”   
Section 2.  
Added bullet point – “allow conservation visits to historic sites outside the Managed Zone, but under strict control by Permit;”

Section 5.

Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 155, Cape Evans, Ross Island


    1) The significant historic value of this Area was formally recognised when it was listed as Historic Site and Monument No.s 16 and 17 in Recommendation 9 (1972). The historic hut at Cape Evans was originally designated as Specially Protected Area (SPA) No. 25 (1997), after a designation by New Zealand.  The Area was designated on the grounds that it contains the Terra Nova hut (Historic Site and Monument No. 16) which is the largest of the historic huts in the Ross Sea region. It was built in January 1911 by the British Antarctic Terra Nova Expedition of 1910-1913, led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, RN. It was subsequently used as a base by the Ross Sea party of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917.

    2) Historic Site and Monument No. 17 contains the Cross on Wind Vane Hill, (erected in the memory of three members of Shackleton’s Ross Sea party who died in 1916). In addition to this, the anchors of the ship Aurora from the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, an instrument shelter, several supply dumps and dog kennels, and numerous artefacts are distributed around the site.  These grounds are still relevant.

    3) The Management Plan for SPA No. 25 was renamed and re-numbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 155 through Decision 1 (2002).  The Management Plan was revised through Measure 2 (2005).

    4) Activities conducted within the Area since the last review have included tourism, research, conservation, management and visits by national programme personnel.  Total visitor numbers to ASPA 155 in the 2005/06 season was 598, and in the 2006/07 season it was 1047.

    5) The consultation process for the review of the Management Plan involved contacting the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, a tourism operator and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The values of the Area were considered more than sufficient to continue protection of the Area.

    6) The substantial change made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan has been to allow for the access of vehicles into the Area if they are approved to do so for management activities in accordance with the aims and objectives of the Management plan.  This change has been made as the hut is under immediate risk of being damaged or destroyed from an ice/snow buildup behind the hut.   The suggested changes include: 

Section 6(ii)
(Second sentence) – deleted “should not be taken onto the land” and replaced with “are prohibited from entering the Area, unless approved to do so for management activities in accordance with 7(i) below.”

Section 7(i)
(bullet point 6) -  deleted “Vehicles are prohibited within the Area.”
Section 7(i) 
Added bullet 7, “Vehicles are prohibited from entering the Area except where it is necessary to use vehicles for management activities in accordance with the aims and objectives of this management plan.  This may include, but is not limited to activities such as clearing snow and ice that is judged to be a threat to the historic hut or other artefacts.  In all such cases consideration shall be given to:
        i. using the minimum sized vehicle required for the job;
        ii. ensuring the vehicle operator is fully trained and aware of the 	provisions of this management plan, and of the sensitivities at the site 	of operation of the vehicle; 
        iii. careful planning and monitoring of all vehicle movements within the 	site so as to avoid damage to either the hut or artefacts buried 	beneath accumulated snow and ice.”
    7) The revised Management Plan is attached for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection.
Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 156, Lewis Bay, Mt Erebus, Ross Island

    1) Lewis Bay was designated as a Specially Protected Area (SPA) No. 27 through Measure XXI-2 (1997), after a proposal by New Zealand.  The Area was designated on the grounds that Lewis Bay was the site of a DC-10 aircraft crash resulting in 257 fatalities in 1979.  Despite the best efforts of recovery teams, not all the bodies of those who died could be recovered and the site was declared a tomb in 1981.   The protected area status ensures the Area remains one of peace and remembrance.  Because the site is a tomb, its values are enduring. These grounds are still relevant.

    2) The Management Plan for SPA No. 27 was renamed and re-numbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 156 through Decision 1 (2002).  The Management Plan was revised through Measure 2 (2003).

    3) Activity in the Area since the last review has involved one overflight of the Area.  New Zealand issued a permit (8 people on an overflight lower than the prescribed 1000 metres) to enter the Area.  The permit was issued for inspection purposes consistent with the management activities as listed in the management plan.

    4) Because of the enduring nature of this tomb site, the Management Plan is not widely distributed for consultation.  No operational concerns have been raised by those operating around the Area.

    5) Given the enduring nature of the values in this Area and the absence of any other concerns regarding this Area, no changes to Management Plan for ASPA No. 156 are proposed.

    6) The Management Plan is attached for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection.
