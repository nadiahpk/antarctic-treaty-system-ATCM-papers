Site Guidelines for Half Moon Island, South Shetland Islands





Site Guidelines for Half Moon Island, South Shetland Islands 

Summary
In accordance with Resolution 5 (2005) which adopts the “Site Guidelines for Visitors”, as well as with Resolution 2 (2006) and 1 (2007), which present guidelines for new sites, and bearing in mind what has been expressed by CEP in the Final Report of IX Meeting in the sense that the CEP together with observers with specific knowledge of visited sites not already covered by visitor guidelines or other forms of site management undertake site reviews and draft site guidelines, using appropriate formats; Argentina, with the valuable input of information provided by several tour operators, presents these draft guidelines to manage the presence of tourism on Half Moon Island, South Shetland Islands, for consideration of CEP XI and eventual adoption by the XXXI ATCM.
The growing number of visitors that has been evidenced at this site during past years, which has reached 15000 tourist landings from 30 cruise ships during de 2006/7 season, has turned the site into one of the four most visited tourist locations in Antarctica. Such a situation has lead to consider the need for a regulatory framework which guarantees the adequate management of this activity in the area.
Argentina´s vast experience due to its extensive presence and work on the island, along with the comprehensive knowledge achieved by tour operators as a result of the significant activity they undertake at the site, allowed for the elaboration of these draft guidelines for Half Moon Island.  During the Antarctic summer season 2007/08, an Argentine representative completed an on-site assessment, in order to check the existing information and verify the potential measures to be included in these Guidelines. This information allowed for the conclusion of the Draft Guidelines which are annexed to this Document. 
The format and contents of this draft follow provisions contained in Resolution 2 (2006), with the purpose of maintaining consistency with other currently existing guidelines or others to be adopted.
In view of the above, Argentina proposes that CEP recommends to the ATCM 
    • to include Half Moon Island in the list of sites for which Guidelines exist and have been adopted by  the Parties; and 
    • that the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat publishes the Guidelines for Half Moon Island on its website and hard copy, as has been done on other occasions.
