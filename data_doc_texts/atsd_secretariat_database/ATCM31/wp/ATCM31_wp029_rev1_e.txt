A Five-Year Work plan for the CEP: Report on Intersessional Review





A Five-Year Work plan for the CEP: Report on Intersessional Review

Working Paper submitted by New Zealand


Introduction

At recent Committee meetings time has been give to considering the strategic direction of the CEP.  The issue was first raised at the VIIth meeting of the Committee in Cape Town (paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Final Report of CEP VII), and was taken substantively forward in discussions (both formal and informal) at CEP VIII in Sweden (paragraphs 11 to 32 of the Final Report of CEP VIII).

In advance of CEP IX, in Edinburgh, an informal workshop was held to discuss “Antarctica’s Future Environmental Challenges”, with a view to assessing the future workload and priorities of the CEP.  The outcomes to the workshop were considered at CEP IX (paragraphs 6 to 11 of the Final Report of CEP IX).

At CEP IX, the Committee agreed to establish an intersessional contact group (ICG) to take forward the notion of developing a five-year work plan for the CEP, as a means of prioritising and better managing the Committee’s workload.  

The outcomes to that intersessional work included a draft five-year work plan for the Committee.

At CEP X the Committee agreed to endorse the five-year workplan on a provisional basis and to append it to the Final Report (Appendix 1 of the Report of CEP X).  CEP X  agreed that the provisional five year plan should be posted on the CEP discussion forum, to provide an opportunity for all Members to comment further on it during the intersessional period.  The Chair offered to provide a summary of all the comments received to assist further discussion of the plan at CEP XI (paragraph 17 of the Final Report of CEP X refers).


Intersessional Review

The provisional five-year work plan was posted on the CEP discussion forum on 12 September 2007.  Four Members provided comments on the provisional plan during the intersessional period.

Summary of comments received

General comments

All Members who responded indicated their support for taking a more strategic or prioritised approach to the work of the Committee.  The need to retain flexibility within the work plan was also stressed, as was the requirement to regularly review the work plan to make sure it remains relevant and up-to-date.  The need to ensure that Members have the opportunity to raise additional subjects at any time was also stressed.

Specific comments

How the CEP Works

The way in which the CEP works was raised by one Member, with the suggestion that the CEP give consideration to new ways of conducting business.  Options raised included workshops (both during and prior to CEP meetings), and establishing subsidiary working groups to deal with specific issues.  It was noted that the ability to learn from the Trial Informal Group on Management Plan Reviews would assist in discussing the utility of such groups.

It was also suggested that a further area for discussion by the Committee is how the CEP works co-operatively with other bodies, including working groups of the ATCM (such as the Tourism Working Group), SCAR and CCAMLR’s Scientific Committee. 

Standing item on the CEP agenda

One Member reiterated the importance of reviewing and revising the work plan to take account of actions taken and changing circumstances.  To this end it was suggested that the CEP retain a standing item on its agenda related to consideration of the CEP’s work plan.

Action items in the Work Plan

Three Members responded with specific comments on the work plan itself.  These changes are reflected in an updated version of the work plan that is appended to this working paper.

Five year work plan – next steps

These comments, together with the updated version of the provisional five-year work plan are offered to the Committee for consideration on next steps.

It is noted that the overall aims of developing a five-year work plan are to:

    • assist the Committee in prioritising its work;
    • enable timely progress to be made on key issues through a more focussed approach to the CEP’s work;
    • enable Observers and expert bodies to better support the CEP’s work through their own forward planning;
    • allow the ATCM to see when it might expect to receive advice on key issues and to comment on the CEP’s priorities.

With those aims in mind, the Committee is invited to consider the following questions with respect to the five-year work plan:

    • Does the Committee feel able to adopt the work plan as a guide for the CEP’s work?
    • Does the agenda of the CEP need to be modified in light of the work plan?
    • Are there new ways of working the CEP wishes to adopt, such as themed meetings, or further use of subsidiary bodies?
