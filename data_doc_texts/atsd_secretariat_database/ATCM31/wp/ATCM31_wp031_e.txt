Review of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 135, 143, 160
Working Paper submitted by Australia 

    1. Summary
This paper reports on the five-yearly review of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 135, 143, 160. Australia recommends the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plans for ASPAs 135 and 160 and notes that no changes are currently required to the Management Plan for ASPA 143. 
    2. Introduction
In accordance with the provisions of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia has reviewed the Management Plans for the following Areas:
    • ASPA 135, North-East Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
    • ASPA 143, Marine Plain, Mule Peninsula, Vestfold Hills, Princesa Elizabeth Land
    • ASPA 160, Frazier Islands, Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica
The reviews were conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (1998). To determine the need to update Area descriptions or management measures, consultations were held with scientists and other persons permitted to enter each Area during the last five years, and a review of recent literature was undertaken. Where possible, a management visit was also conducted during the 2007/08 season.
The following sections briefly describe the outcomes of the review of each Management Plan.
    3. ASPA 135, North-East Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
The North-east Bailey Peninsula ASPA is located in close proximity to Australia’s Casey station on Bailey Peninsula at the western end of Vincennes Bay. Designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest was proposed by Australia, and SSSI 16 was adopted at ATCM XIII (Recommendation XIII-9). In accordance with Resolution 5 (1996) the Area was redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 135, and the first revised Management Plan for the ASPA was adopted at ATCM XXVI (Measure 2, 2003). The Area has an extremely rich and diverse assemblage of vegetation and is protected for its intrinsic ecological value and scientific importance, particularly for botany, microbiology, soil science and glacial geomorphology. The ASPA is designated for an indefinite period.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 135
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • Provisions relating to vehicle use are revised to allow limited and appropriate access to the Area for the purpose of maintaining essential communications facilities for Casey station. The effect of this change is to re-institute access provisions similar to those detailed in the original management plan for SSSI 16.
    • Appendixes summarising species information are updated on the basis of recent studies.
    • The list of supporting documentation is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    4. ASPA 143, Marine Plain, Mule Peninsula, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land
The Marine Plain ASPA is located on and adjacent to Mule Peninsula in the Vestfold Hills, approximately 10 km south-east of Australia’s Davis station. Designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest was proposed by Australia, and SSSI 25 was adopted at ATCM XIV (Recommendation XIV-5, 1987). In accordance with Resolution 5 (1996) the Area was redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 143, and the first revised Management Plan for the ASPA was adopted at ATCM XXVI (Measure 2, 2003). The Area contains outstanding vertebrate fossil fauna and rare geological features and is of exceptional ongoing scientific interest. Burton Lake, within the Area, represents a unique stage in the biological and physico-chemical evolution of a terrestrial water body from the marine environment. The ASPA is designated for an indefinite period.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 143
    • Having conducted a review, including a management visit during the 2007/08 summer, Australia has determined that no amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 143 are currently required.
    5. ASPA 160, Frazier Islands, Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica
The Frazier Islands ASPA comprises three small islands (Nelly, Dewart and Charlton) with a combined total area of approximately 0.6 km². The islands lie in the eastern part of Vincennes Bay approximately 16 km to the west-north-west of Australia’s Casey station. Designation as an ASPA was proposed by Australia and adopted at ATCM XXVI (Measure 2, 2003). The islands are one of only four known breeding localities of Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus around the coastline of continental Antarctica, are the only breeding site in nearly 3000 km of coastline between Davis station and Dumont d’Urville, and provide a reference area for future comparative studies with other breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels. The ASPA is designated for an indefinite period.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 160
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • Consistent with recommendations in the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas an Introduction has been added, with content largely drawn from other sections of the original Management Plan.
    • Appendix 1 contains a revised summary of past Southern Giant Petrel observations at the Frazier Islands, updated as a result of a detailed review to compile data for the May 2008 SCAR workshop to consider the status of the species. It also incorporates the results of a census conducted during the 2005/06 season, which suggested a slight increase – from 248 to 274 pairs– in the total breeding population. References to the global population of the species are also updated to reflect the most recent (2007) entry on the IUCN Red List, on advice from Birdlife International. 
    • The provisions relating to access for censuses are slightly modified. Where previously the management plan allowed access to the Area during the breeding period only once every five years for the purpose of conducting a Southern Giant Petrel census, the plan now encourages the conduct of a census at least once every five years. Providing the opportunity for more frequent censuses, undertaken in an appropriate manner, improves the chances of developing a more detailed understanding of population status and trends.
    • The list of supporting documentation is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    6. Recommendations
Australia recommends the CEP:
    1) Approve the updated Management Plans for ASPAs 135 and 160; and
    2) Note that Australia has reviewed the Management Plan for ASPA 143 and determined no revision is currently required.
