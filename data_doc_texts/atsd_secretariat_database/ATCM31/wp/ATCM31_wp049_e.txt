Оn the status and development of the Antarctic Treaty System
The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 has become a reliable legal basis determining the international regime of management of the South Polar Region and the main principles of cooperation of the countries-participants to this legal act. New problems that the Antarctic community was facing later were successfully solved by amendments in the form of Recommendations of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) and beginning from 1995, in the form of ATCM Measures, Decisions and Resolutions. With the purpose of environmental protection and conservation of Antarctic living organisms, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals of 1972, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources of 1980 and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty of 1991 were developed and adopted. When these documents came into legal force (1978, 1982 and 1998, respectively), all aforementioned Antarctic legal acts formed the Antarctic Treaty System, which expresses the main requirements of the international community in respect of preserving the sixth continent and the ambient seas for future generations. 
For regulating the directions of activity of the Antarctic community in different periods of existence of the Antarctic Treaty System, the international governance bodies were established, which also serve as components of the aforementioned System. These include:
    • Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), established in April 1982 with the headquarters in Hobart (Australia). It regulates the issues of practical fishing in the Southern Ocean waters and the related problems of scientific organization of fishery, conservation of marine ecosystems and other environmental aspects;
    • Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), established in May 1998 after the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty had come into force. CEP works exclusively within the structure of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) and controls all topics of the aforementioned Protocol;
    • Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, formed in 2004 with the aim to address the procedural and organizational issues during the intersessional period between the next ATCMs. The Headquarters of the Secretariat is in Buenos-Aires (Argentina);
    • Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), created under the aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions on the basis of the Special Committee on Antarctic Research for achieving objectives of the International Geophysical Year (1957-58). In 1961, it was transformed to SCAR with the responsibility of establishing and providing assistance and coordination of scientific activity in the Antarctic for the purpose of working out and analyzing scientific programs of sub-polar scale and significance. The Headquarters of SCAR is in Cambridge (Great Britain);
    • Council of Managers of Antarctic National Programs (COMNAP), established in 1989 on the basis of a permanent SCAR Working Group on Antarctic Logistics. The COMNAP is intended for holding forums, providing consultations and cooperation between the countries actively operating in the Antarctic at the practical expedition level. The Headquarters of COMNAP is in Hobart (Australia).
The highest governance body of the Antarctic Treaty is the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCMs), held by the Consultative Parties to the Treaty according to the order of the names of their countries in Latin alphabet. The representatives of CCAMLR, SCAR and COMNAP participate in the work of ATCM as observers. In addition, delegations or representatives of different intergovernmental or international public organizations participate in the meetings as experts. These include the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), International Maritime Organization (IMO), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), World Tourism Organization (WTO), International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) and International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). These international organizations in spite of their interest in the Antarctic issues are not formally the structural elements of the Antarctic Treaty System, as they were formed outside the Treaty legal and organizational framework.
All international bodies of the Antarctic Treaty System carry out their activity in strict compliance with those acts of the international law under which they were established and/or according to the corresponding clauses (constitutions) about their activity, adopted by the corresponding Recommendations, Measures or Decisions of different ATCM. The current situation quite clearly regulates management of different types of activity in the Antarctic not permitting their overlapping. This makes the work on regulation of activity efficient and it is constantly in the sphere of ATCM control.
It is quite understandable that adoption and coming into force of the majority of the international law acts, which aim at combining into one common direction the international activity of the countries with different geopolitical interests, become a result of a certain compromise between the authors of the document in question and their opponents at the stage of discussion. Some acts of the international law could never come into legal force without a compromise. It is natural that this situation does not always suit the authors of the documents, as sometimes they were trying to achieve quite a different result. In this connection they may undertake specific steps for updating or for new wording of the already adopted legal documents or for adopting all kinds of amendments to the effective legal acts. In practice of the Antarctic Treaty System such measures can lead to duplicating of some functions by the governing international bodies of this System, which will in our opinion result not only in the excessive overlapping of functions, but also in possible adoption of different decisions on one and the same issue by different management bodies. Attempts to transfer to CEP the issues of defining the protected marine species of living organisms or designating the Antarctic Specially Protected and Specially Managed Marine Areas, although these functions are spelled out not in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, but in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, i.e., are a prerogative of CCAMLR, can serve as an example. Recently, SCAR made a decision to set up a special group on the Antarctic environment protection. It is hoped that this group will be involved exclusively in the scientific issues of environmental protection and will not duplicate the aspects of this problem that are currently dealt with by CEP and COMNAP. It is recalled that COMNAP has been already actively working for several years on the issues of introducing different technologies and technical solutions for removing life activity waste from infrastructure facilities of the Antarctic expeditions. A wide exchange of opinions between specialists in different fields of activity in the Antarctic can be achieved at various international forums, in which formal representatives of the aforementioned governance bodies of the Antarctic Treaty System can also participate. These measures will ensure not only a clear governance but also stability of the entire Treaty System, in which all Parties to it are obviously interested.
