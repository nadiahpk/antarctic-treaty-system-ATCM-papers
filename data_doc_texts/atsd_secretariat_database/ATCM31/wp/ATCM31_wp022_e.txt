Implications of Tourist Vessels flagged to non-Parties for the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty System
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand

At the 29th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXIX) a number of delegations expressed concerns about the flagging of vessels participating in the Antarctic tourism trade to states which are not Parties to the Antarctic Treaty or its Protocol on Environmental Protection.1  

New Zealand recalled this concern at ATCM XXX, noting in WP 14 three areas in which ‘non- Party’ vessels have implications for the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty System: 2

    • There is no obligation on non-Party Flag States to provide emergency response action under Article 15 of the Protocol.3
    • In the case of a non-Party vessel, there is no obligation to enable an inspection under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty.4
    • There is also no obligation on non-Party vessels to enable an inspection under Article 14 of the Protocol.5

It is the Flag State which has the duty to “effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag” (UNCLOS Article 94).  The fact that a tourist expedition which has chartered a vessel may have completed the environmental impact assessment procedures of the Protocol through a Party does not override the Flag State’s ultimate responsibility for the vessel.

Where the Flag State is a Party to the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol, it will of course be bound by the obligations of those agreements.  Where it is not a Party, there is a significant gap which has the potential to undermine the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty System.
Since ATCM XXX there have been a number of incidents involving vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area.  Most notable of these was the sinking of the MV Explorer, a Liberian flagged vessel, in November 2007.  Reports on the sinking were circulated through the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat by Canada,6 Chile, IAATO7 and the United Kingdom.8  At the time of writing Liberia had not provided a report.

Figures provided by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) for commercial tourist vessels during 2001-2006 indicated that approximately 30-40% of vessels operated by IAATO Members were flagged to countries neither Party to the Antarctic Treaty nor the Protocol.9

The 2006/07 season figures, including non-IAATO vessels where that information was available, show that approximately 40% of the vessels were flagged to non-Parties, with non- Party vessels carrying out close to half of all voyages (approximately 44%).10  Overall, a greater number of passengers were carried on non Party vessels.11  The average number of passengers per voyage was greater on non-Party vessels at around 168, compared to the approximately 99 passengers carried on each Party vessel on average.12

These figures highlight the large number of private individuals and vessels visiting the Antarctic Treaty area each year who are not under the jurisdiction of an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party or Party to the Protocol at the time.

During discussion of WP14 at ATCM XXX, the Meeting agreed that the high proportion of vessels in the tourism trade flagged to non-Parties was an issue of considerable concern.  Parties were told that the statistics obtained in Ushuaia during the 2006/07 austral summer comparing Party and non-Party tourist ships showed that 58% were from non-Parties and 42% from Parties.13  New Zealand noted that in its view in a real maritime emergency reliance on the obligations of the organizer through the environmental impact assessment process would likely not be sufficient because the responsibility for the vessel lay with the Flag State.  The Meeting agreed to re-visit this matter at ATCM XXXI.14

With this in mind, Parties may wish to consider:

    • Whether they should discourage the use of non-Party vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area; and, if so
    • How this might be done.
