Revised Draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plan for the Mount Harding, Grove Mountains, East Antarctica

Working Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection by China
    1. Introduction
At CEP X China submitted Working Paper 32 Draft Management Plan for the Antarctic Specially Protected Area Mount Harding, Grove Mountains, East Antarctica.  China presented this draft management plan and made a visual presentation on the natural features of the site proposed to be protected by the proposed ASPA. (CEP X Final Report, Para 141).
The ASPA is proposed to primarily protect the unique geomorphological features of the area for scientific research to ensure that the valuable long-term glacial-geological research in this proposed ASPA can be undertaken in an environmentally sensitive manner, which could not be done elsewhere on earth. 
All these features  involve the integral remains of the advance and retreat, and the precious physiognomy of glacier erosion preserved in the ice sheet of inland Antarctica and which is of its great scientific, aesthetic and wilderness values, The Committee agreed to refer the draft Management Plan for intersessional review (CEP X Final Report, Para 143)
    2. Intersessional review 
The proponent was grateful to receive comments from the trial informal group established to review draft Management Plans in accordance with Terms of Reference outlined in Appendix 2 to the CEP X Final Report and the comments from Australia. 
The proponent resubmitted an updated version of the draft Management Plan, highlighting all changes made in response to comments received and other minor amendments, to the CEP Discussion Forum. In summary, the revised draft Management Plan:
    • shortens the contents in Part 1 “Introduction” and Subsection “Physiognomy” in Section 6(i) “Geographical co-ordinates, boundary marks, general climate condition in summer and physiognomy”;
    • expands upon the activities which Australia has ever undertaken around Mount Harding and the regional location description and activities allowed to be conducted in this proposed ASPA in Part 1 “Introduction”;
    • adds some new important contents to Part 6 “Description of the Area”, Part 7 “Permit”; 
    • includes  three revised map and one supplement map(Map A1,A2, Map B, Map C); 
    • deletes some incorrectly suggested sentences; and
    • responds to other comments raised, through relevant editorial and other drafting improvements.
    3. Plan submission
China resubmits this revised Management Plan for endorsement by the CEP and adoption by the ATCM.
