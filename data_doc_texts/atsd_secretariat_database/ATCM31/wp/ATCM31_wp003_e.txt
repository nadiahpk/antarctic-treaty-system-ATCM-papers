Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at
Narębski Point, Barton Peninsula, King George Island
Working Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection
 by the Republic of Korea

1.  Introduction
The Republic of Korea proposes the designation of Narębski Point, Barton Peninsula, King George Island as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) under Article 3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
Narębski Point, terrestrial area excluding intertidal zone, has high species richness of flora and fauna, and the abundance of some of these is, in some cases, exceptional. The cover of mosses, lichens, and grasses is very extensive. There is the largest Chinstrap penguin colony in King George Island and the area also contains large number of Gentoo Penguins and breeding areas of seven other birds. As such, the Area provides exceptional opportunities for the scientific study of terrestrial biological communities. 
The Management Plan aims to protect the unique terrestrial ecosystem found in the Area and, in particular, reduce the risk of invasive species introductions from both local and global sites. 
2.  Management plan format
The Management Plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, appended to Resolution 2 (1998) of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXII.
3.  Intersessional review
The draft management plan is submitted for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection. The Republic of Korea would be pleased to convene an intersessional contact group to discuss the draft plan for full consideration at CEP XII.
