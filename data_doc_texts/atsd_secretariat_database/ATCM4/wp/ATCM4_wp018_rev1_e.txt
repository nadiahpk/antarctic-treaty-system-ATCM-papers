Telecommunications

PREAMBLE

To this date there have been various meetings to consider
the urgent need of the Governments signatory to the Antarctic
Treaty to make an official pronouncement in regard to Antarctic
telecommunications. These meetings have brought forth valuable
proposals for co-ordination and traffic schemes.

Thus Recommendations I-XI and II-III of the First and Se-
cond Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings respectively gave
rise to the Meeting in Washington from 24 to 28 June 1963, on
Telecommunications in the Antarctic Treaty Area, in which the
co-ordination of Antarctic radio-communication was considered.
These studies produced eleven Recommendations, which were rati-
fied by the Third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

At the Third Consultative Meeting, which took place in
Brussels from 2 to 13 June 1964, it was resolved (Recommendation
III-V) to leave analysis of the results of the Recommendations
on Telecommunications from the Washington Meeting for the Pre-
paratory Meeting of the Fourth Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting.

Lastly, the Preparatory Meeting of the Fourth Antarcti-
c Treaty Consultative Meeting, held in Santiago from 5 to 9 Sep-
tember of this year, decided to leave to the Meeting itself the
final study of the Recommendations of the Washington Meeting.

Besides this, the Meeting held in Melbourne from 23 February
to 3 March this year established the Antarctic Meteorological
Group of WMO which, among other matters, analysed the Recommenda-
tions on Telecommunications in the Antarctic Treaty Area made by
the Washington Meeting, suggesting certain modifications which
would usefully integrate the Antarctic network of observations
and meteorological reports with the scheme proposed for the WWW.

From the foregoing it seems necessary to study a series
of recommendations on Antarctic Telecommunications on the ba-
sis of the technical material available to us from the Washing-
ton and Melbourne Meetings and the experience gained by the sig-
natory countries in the operation of their own telecommunication
systems.

Analysis of the Washington Recommendations and of the satis-
factory results already obtained by their partial fulfilment,
leads us to add to and improve these Recommendations with a view
to their effective and general -implementation. In the same way,
analysis of the Melbourne Recommendations in the light of the
international advantages implied for WWW, shows the value of mak-
ing the corresponding modifications in the Washington Recommenda-
tions.

In accordance then, with the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty,
it is proposed that this Fourth Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting consider the adoption of the following resolutions on Te-
lecommunications in the Antarctic Treaty Area.

RECOMMENDATION I

CO-ORDINATED TIMETABLE FOR URGENT TRAFFIC

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

a)    That meteorological information constitute a large propor-
tion of the total traffic handled by operators at Antarctic 
stations;

b)    That such information loses much of its value for analysis 
and forecast if it does not arrive at the analysing centres 
within a few hours of the observations having been made;

c)    That forecasts for flying and for land operations are ur-
gently needed by many Antarctic stations;

d)    That the Southern Hemisphere Analysis Center (SHAC), si-
tuated in Melbourne, needs meteorological data collected 
in the Antarctic Treaty Area, as well as in the rest of 
the Hemisphere; and

e)    That both the Melbourne Meeting and the World Weather 
Watch (WWW) recommend setting up three Regional Meteorolo-
gical Centres in the Antarctic Treaty Area;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

1.    That all Antarctic stations adjust their radio timetables 
to hours which allow meteorological information compiled 
to reach the Regional Meteorological Centres (RMC) and 
SHAC as soon as possible, but under no circumstances with a 
delay of more than one hour and thirty minutes for the sur-
face meteorological information collected every six hours, 
and of not more than four hours for upper air data, after 
the nominal time of commencement of the relevant observation;

2.    That the timetables so established are so arranged as to 
allow other urgent transmissions to be made by the same means 
and during the same hours;

3.    That the necessary adjustments be made in the regular links 
according to the adjoined timetable, as soon as possible; and

4.    That other transmissions which the contracting parties may 
arrange do not interfere with this timetable except in cases 
of emergency where human life is endangered or in cases where 
the station head, with full justification, may so decide.

(*):  In addition, arrangements must be made between the appointed
      RMC stations and SHAC, in order to set a timetable of regu-
      lar bilateral links especially in relation to the interchange
      of processed information (regional and hemispheric analysis
      and forecasts).

RECOMMENDATION II
                  LINKS BETWEEN RMC STATIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC
                  TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

a)  That the meteorological information gathered throughout 
     Antarctica is required for analysis in SHAC and for fore-
     casts at Mc Murdo, Mirny and Presidente Aguirre Cerda (PAC);

b)  That radio transmission of meteorological data across the 
     auroral zone offers a less reliable route than is required.

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

    That they do all they can to find the best method for ob-
taining reliable links to RMC stations between RMC stations and 
between RMC and SHAC.

RECOMMENDATION III
PROVISIONAL ROUTING OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA
GATHERED IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

a)  That it is necessary to establish certain new channels in 
order to obtain the desired improvements in the transmission 
of meteorological data;

b)  That there are, nevertheless, important limitations of a 
practical nature dependent on the financial resources avail-
able to some Antarctic stations; and

c)  That the Representatives have analysed these limitations 
for each terminal of the new routing desired for radio cir-
cuits.

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

    That the normal routes for transmitting meteorological data 
from the observation areas to SHAC be the RMC stations. (*) 
(*) The system of channelling for the observation areas in the 
Antarctic Peninsula is set out in the attached Annex to this 
Recommendation.

RECOMMENDATION IV
ORGANIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL LINKS

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

a)  That it is advisable to keep the number of international
radio links in the Antarctic to the minimum necessary for
the amount of traffic required;

b)  That the capacity and quality of the RMC telecommunications
systems is equal to that of the Regional Telecommunications
Hubs (RTH), and therefore the main points in the interna-
tional Antarctic network should be considered;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

That the international radio links in the Antarctic be li-
mited, as far as possible, to the routes inferred from the Re-
commendation III.

RECOMMENDATION V

ALTERNATIVE ROUTES FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING :

   The need to keep open a limited number of alternative
routes in case the route chosen for one of the main links should,
for any reason, fail;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS :

   That alternative routes be studied and test transmissions
be effected by those routes at regular intervals.

RECOMMENDATION VI
AERIALS

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

The need to co-ordinate the design of the aerial systems at both ends of each international radio link in order to create suitable circuit conditions;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

1. That each of those links be provided, if possible, with directive aerials, and

2. That in each of those links, by agreement among the parties concerned, the transmitting and receiving aerials for each of the main channels be compatible as regards polarization and take-off angle.

RECOMMENDATION VII
MODES OF TRANSMISSION

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

The need to co-ordinate the techniques used at both ends
of each international radio link if communication is to be
effective;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

1.      That all modes of transmission used by the main stations
        be brought into line, as far as possible, with the recommenda-
        tions of the International Telegraphy and Telephony Consult-
        ative Committee (including, inter alia, the use of transmission
        speeds of 50 bauds instead of 45 bauds), and of the Interna-
        tional Radiocommunications Consultative Committee;

2.      That the aim be to use, as soon as possible, 5-unit radio-
        teletypes on the RMC channels.

3.      That consideration be given to the possibility of using such
        systems as frequency modulation, which would be less suscep-
        tible to interference than amplitude modulation.

RECOMMENDATION VIII
SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

a) That the stations requiring search and rescue services are precisely those which cannot on their own provide the means of rendering timely aid to any person who might need it;

(b) That the stations from which such assistance is requested are very probably those which operate aircraft for long-dis-
tance flights in the Antarctic;

(c) That such aircraft are not normally in a position to take off immediately on long transcontinental flights, and that it takes time to prepare an operation of that nature; and

(d) That when the rescue aircraft reaches the area, presuma-
bly a search would have to be made for the persons requir-
ing assistance;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

That they adopt the following uniform procedure for the operation of radio equipment used in search and rescue operations in Antarctica:

(i) Communications regarding assistance should have absolute priority over all other communications awaiting transmission at the time;

(ii) The procedure for radio operations will be that specified for mobile services in Chapter VIII, Article 36, of the Ra-
dio Regulations, adopted by the International Telecommunica-
tions Union at Geneva in 1959;

(iii) In addition, after transmitting the original call for help, the station or stations providing assistance should keep in constant touch, throughout the search and rescue operations, with the station requesting assistance, until such time as the latter considers that the operation has been concluded.

RECOMMENDATION IX
RADIO AIDS TO AIR NAVIGATION

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

(a) That international flights in Antarctica are becoming daily
more frequent;

(b) That for purposes of increasing the safety of aircraft
operating in this area it is essential for certain land sta-
tions to have basic radionavigation equipment;

(c) That agreement should be reached regarding a system to
which the various countries can adhere in the next five years,
when they undertake the installation of land radio aids for
air navigation or when they envisage any change in the ins-
tallations at their stations; and

(d) That the definitive system for the Antarctic should be for-
mulated with due regard for the system of channels existing
at the time, which should be requested from the International
Civil Aviation Organization or any other international agen-
cy it might suggest.

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

1. That, as soon as possible, an omnidirectional radio beacon
with sufficient power to serve air navigation be installed
at each station possessing landing facilities, and omnidirec-
tional medium-frequency radio beacons be installed at such
stations on the coast.

2. That the details of types, frequency and power of the radio
aid equirements installed be the subject of the information
exchanged yearly in accordance with the terms of Recommenda-
tion I-VI, paragraph (8), of the First Antarctic Treaty Con-
sultative Meeting, in order that the parties wishing to
equip their aircraft so as to make use of the land radio aids
may do so.

RECOMMENDATION X

TIME SCHEDULE FOR THE BEGINNING AND END RADIO TRANSMISSIONS

The Representatives,

CONSIDERING:

(a) That it is not always possible to avoid interference between
radiotransmission and ionospheric observation services, owing
to the fact that, for logistic reasons, the installations are
located in small areas;

(b) That it is advisable to promote broad international under-
standing on this question, since ionospheric observations
should begin simultaneously at all stations, and the reports
are transmitted at the same time from the radiocommunications
centres at all bases;

(c) That excessive traffic is noted at H+00 minutes, and then
diminishes rapidly;

(d) That the recommendations of the international scientific
organizations, stipulate that the ionospheric probing data
must be obtained at H+00 minutes over the entire world;

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS:

That, except in emergencies, radio transmissions on inter-
national channels by those Antarctic stations where ionospheric
probing is required must end systematically at H-05 and begin sys-
tematically at H+05, whenever radio traffic is between H-05 and
H+05.
