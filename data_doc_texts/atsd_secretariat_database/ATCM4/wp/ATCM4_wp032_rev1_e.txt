DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

November 15, 1966

Acceptance of Approved Recommendations

Considering that, in becoming Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty, States bind themselves to carry out its provisions and
to uphold its purposes and principles;

Taking into account that Recommendations which become
effective in accordance with Article IX of the Treaty are, in
terms of that Article, "measures in furtherance of the princi-
ples and objectives of the Treaty";

Considering further that Approved Recommendations are
an essential part of the overall structure of cooperation esta-
blished by the Treaty;

Recognizing that in pursuance of the principles and
objectives of the Treaty there should be uniformity of practice
in the activity of all Parties active in Antarctica; and

Recognizing further that Contracting Parties undertake,
in the terms of Article X of the Treaty, to exert appropriate
efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to
the end that no one engages in any activity in Antarctica con-
trary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that,
in urging or inviting Parties by accession pursuant to Recommen-
dation III-VII to accept Approved Recommendations, they advise
such Parties that Approved Recommendations are to be viewed in
the light of the obligations assumed under Article X of the Treaty.
