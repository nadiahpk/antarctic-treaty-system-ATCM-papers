EFFECTS OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM

Considering that tourism is not mentioned in the Antarctic
Treaty, but recognizing that the effects of tourist activities
may prejudice the conduct of scientific research, preservation
of fauna and flora and the operation of Antarctic stations;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that:

1. A Government in whose territory a tourist or other non-
scientific expedition is being organized furnish notice of
the expedition as soon as possible through diplomatic chan-
nels to any other Government whose station the expedition
plans to visit;

2. A Government provide on request information as promptly
as possible regarding the conditions upon which it would
grant permission for tourist groups to visit Antarctic
stations which it maintains; and

3. Such permission be withheld unless reasonable assurances
are given of compliance with the provisions of the Treaty
and Recommendations then effective, and the conditions
applicable at stations to be visited.
