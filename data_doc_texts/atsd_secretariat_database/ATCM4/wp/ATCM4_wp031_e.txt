DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES
Under The Item
STATUS OF MEETINGS OF EXPERTS

Meetings of Experts

November 7, 1966

The Representatives recommend to their Governments:

1. That Meetings of Experts be convened from time to time
as the need arises to discuss practical problems relating to
Antarctic activities. Such meetings may be attended by experts
from Consultative Parties. With the agreement of all the Con-
sultative Parties, other experts may be invited to attend.  They
may submit documents and make statements, but they may not vote.

2. That such meetings be convened and the terms of reference
be established either at Consultative Meetings or as a result of
agreement reached through diplomatic channels among all the Con-
sultative Parties.

3. That whenever any Consultative Party judges that a sub-
ject dealt with by a Meeting of Experts warrants formal agree-
ment under Article IX of the Treaty, the Party concerned may
propose an appropriate recommendation at a subsequent Consultative
Meeting.

4. That the host Government circulate a report concerning
the Meeting of Experts to all the Contracting Parties.
