DRAFT RECOMMENDATION PRESENTED BY CHILE

ITEM 5 OF THE AGENDA

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Considering the need to keep up to date the traffic system
of radio communications in Antarctica, and the desirability of
being able to transmit observation data from the Antarctic
Treaty Area to the world system for the collection of meteoro-
logical information:

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that,
before the Consultative Meeting scheduled to take place in
Paris in 1968, they consider the inclusion in the Agenda of an
examination of the Recommendations on Telecommunications made
by the Washington Meeting, in the light of the new data existing
on the subject at the time.
