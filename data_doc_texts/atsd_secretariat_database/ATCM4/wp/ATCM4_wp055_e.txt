The Representatives, considering that the Balleny Islands;

ports a fauna and flora which reflects many circumpolar distribu-
tions at this latitude and that Sabrina Island in particular pro-
vides a representative sample of this fauna and flora, recommend
to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B,
Specially Protected Arcas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conser-
vation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:-
