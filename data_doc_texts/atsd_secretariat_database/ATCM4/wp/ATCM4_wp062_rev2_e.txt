DRAFT RECOMMENDATION PRESENTED BY CHILE AND
THE UNITED KINGDOM
ITEM 5 OF THE AGENDA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Considering the need to keep up to date the traffic system
of Antarctic radio communications, and the necessity to transmit
observational data from the Treaty Area to the world system for
the collection of meteorological information:

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that,
before the Consultative Meeting scheduled to take place in Paris
in 1968, they consider the inclusion in the Agenda, in the light
of prevailing conditions at that time, an examination of the Re-
commendations on Telecommunications made by the Washington Meeting
on Telecommunications in 1963.
