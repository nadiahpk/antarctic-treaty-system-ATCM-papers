STATUS OF MEETINGS OF EXPERTS

RECOMMENDATION

Realizing that it is not always practical to conclude formal agreements on detailed technical matters relating to Antarc-
tic activities;

Considering that cooperation under the Antarctic Treaty
need not be confined to those matters requiring formal inter-
governmental agreement but may also extend to informal working
arrangements between the various expeditions in Antarctica;

Considering further that such informal working arrangements
can further the spirit of cooperation under the Antarctic Treaty;

Taking into account the benefits that can result from such
informal cooperation, both as regards the safety of men and equip-
ment and increased efficiency of the various expeditions;

The Representatives recommend to their governments:

1. That Meetings of Experts be convened from time to time
as the need arises to discuss practical problems relating to
Antarctic Activities. Such meetings may be attended by experts
from Consultative Parties, and by any independant experts in-
vited to attend by all the Consultative Parties.

2. That such meetings be convened and the terms of Reference
be established by agreement between all the Consultative Parties;

3. That these Meetings of Experts would exchange views on
the subject of their meeting and would, whenever it is found use-
ful to do so, work out cooperative arrangements at the technical
or operational level. Such arrangements shall not have the sta-
tus of Recommendations, and accordingly would not be submitted
to government for formal approval.

4. That it be understood that any such cooperative arrange-
ment agreed to and later put into practice by mutual agreement
at the technical or operational level may be modified through
appropriate consultations among those concerned.

5. That whonever any Consultative Party judges that a sub-
ject dealt with by a Meeting of Experts warrants formal agree-
ment, the Party concerned may propose an appropriate recommenda-
tion at a subsequent Consultative Meeting.
