vation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (Recommendation 
III-VIII)

The Representatives, taking into consideration Article VI

and Fauna (Recommendation III-VIII), recommend to their Govern-
ments that in cases where expeditions of several Participating 
Governments are working in the same region of the Treaty area 
those Governments should, on issuing permits in accordance 
with Article VI, take whatever measures they may consider ne-
cessary to ensure that the total number of native mammals and 
birds killed or captured accords with the requirements of 
Article VI:4.
