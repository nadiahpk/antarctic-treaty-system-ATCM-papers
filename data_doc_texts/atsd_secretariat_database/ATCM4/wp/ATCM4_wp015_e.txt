OPENING ADDRESS DELIVERED BY MR. GABRIEL VALDES, MINISTER
FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF CHILE, AT THE FOURTH
ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING

Delegates,

On behalf of the Government of Chile, it is both a pleasu-
re and an honour to welcome you to the Fourth Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting, which I feel sure will achieve important
progress in the field of international co-operation.

It is worth while stressing the principles underlying the
Antarctic Treaty, namely, that Antarctica should be used for
peaceful purposes only, and that international co-operation in
scientific investigation should be promoted for the good of all
mankind.

Experience in the last two years has shown that this spirit
has not only been maintained, but it has fostered a policy of
broad co-operation among the countries signatories to the Treaty.
This praiseworthy community attitude points the way and provides
grounds for hope in the context of world co-existence.

The cutstanding results of that international co-operation
which was prompted by the Treaty are embodied in various concepts
and rules prevailing in Antarctica today, and which should be ex-
tended to other parts of the world as well.

These include the prohibition on nuclear explosions and the
disposal there of radioactive waste material, as well as the es-
tablishment of a thorough system of inspection.

The complex nature of modern knowledge and the accelerated
progress made in science and technology are daily giving rise to
new problems.

Modern man's thirst for knowledge is no longer fulfilled.
His curiosity is not satisfied through simple information media,
and he seeks a thorough knowledge of the world, which is beco-
ming smaller and smaller the more he knows about the Universe.

The Provisional Agenda of this Consultative Meeting invites
you tc pursue the inexhaustible task of advancing in your own
particular specialties, thereby marking out the course for each
of our Governments to follow.

The Agenda includes subjects relating to Logistics, Tele-
communications, Meteorology and Tourism, in addition to an item
on the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, which I con-
sider of the greatest importance today.

I am confident that in considering them again, the deep
significance of the Antarctic Treaty and its spirit of universa-
lity will guide your deliberations.

I know that you have all come here imbued with a desire to
forge ahead and ready once again to face the challenge of know-
ledge.  I am honoured to invite you to meet it and formally de-
clare the Fourth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting open.
