AGENDA ITEM 6: ANNEXES TO THE AGREED MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION
OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA

10 November 1966

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: DION ISLANDS

The Representatives, considering that amongst the Dion Islands
is found the only colony of Emperor Penguins, ( Aptenodytes forsteri)
known to exist on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, and that
the isolation of this colony from others of the same species makes
it of outstanding scientific interest, recommend to their Govern-
ments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected
Areas, of the Agreed Measures:-

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA NO...

DION ISLANDS, MARGUERITE BAY, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA

Lat. 67^(o)52'S., Long. 68^(o)43'W.

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: GREEN ISLAND

The Representatives, considering that the vegetation on 
Green Island is exceptionally rich, that it is probably the 
most luxuriant anywhere on the west side of the Antarctic 
Peninsula, that in some places the humus is 2 metres thick, 
and that this area, of oustanding scientific interest, should 
be protected because it is probably one of the most diverse 
ecosystems in Antarctica, recommend to their Governments that 
the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, 
of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna 
and Flora:-

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No...

GREEN ISLAND, BERTHELOT ISLANDS, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS:  BYERS PENINSULA

The Representatives, considering that Byers Peninsula supports 
a considerable diversity of plant and animal life, including many 
invertebrates, that substantial populations of Elephant Seals 
(Mirounga leonina) and small colonies of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus 
species) are found on the beaches, that Fur Seals breed on Window 
Island and that the close association of such a large variety of 
Antarctic plants and animals within a relatively small area is of 
outstanding scientific interest, recommend to their Governments 
that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected 
Areas of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic 
Flora and Fauna:-

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No...

BYERS PENINSULA, LIVINGSTON ISLAND, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS.

Lat. 62°38'S., Long. 61°05'W.

western margin of the permanent ice sheet on Livingston Island.  
The five small ice free areas on the south coast immediately to 
the east are also included.  Window Island is included within 
the area, but no other off-lying islands and rocks.  The area 
is shown on the attached map.

The close association of such a large variety of Antarctic 
plants and animals, including a breeding colony of Fur Seals 
(Arctocephalus tropicales gazella), within a relatively small 
area is of outstanding scientific interest.

Shetland Islands and is an area of outstanding ecological inte-
rest, recommend to their Governments that the following be in-
serted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed

ISLANDS.

The Representatives, considering that Southern Powell Island
and the adjacent islands support substantial vegetation and a
considerable bird and mammal fauna, that they provide a repre-
sentative sample of the natural ecology of the South Orkney Is-
lands, rendered more important by the presence of the nucleus
of an expanding colony of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis
gazella), recommend to their Governments that the following be
inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:-

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No...

SOUTHERN POWELL ISLAND AND ADJACENT ISLANDS, SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS.

Lat. 60°45'S., Long. 45°02'W
