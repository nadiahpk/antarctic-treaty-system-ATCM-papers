AGENDA ITEM No 11

Effects of Tourism in Antarctica

November 10, 1966

Observing that tourism is not expressly mentioned in the Antarctic Treaty.

Noting, however, that tourist activities in Antarctica must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and Recommendations which have become effective;

Recognizing that such tourist activities may affect the conduct of scientific research and the operation of Antarctic stations;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that:

1. - Upon request from any State in which Antarctic tours are being organized to visit stations of a Consultative Party, such Party provide information regarding the conditions upon which it will grant permission for tourist groups to visit its Antarctic stations; and

2. - Such permission be withheld from the organizer of a group who fails to take reasonable measures to ensure compliance by his group with the provisions of the Treaty and Recommendations which have become effective and the conditions applicable at stations visited.
