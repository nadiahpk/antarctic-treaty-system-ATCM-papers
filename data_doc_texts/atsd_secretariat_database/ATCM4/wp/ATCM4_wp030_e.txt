DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY
DELEGATION OF NEW ZEALAND

AGENDA ITEM 8.

1.   The Representatives recommend to their Governments that
for the effective implementation of the provisions of
Article XII cf the Agreed Measurcs, documents exchanged
annually by Participating Governments on the matters
set down in paragraph 1 (a) cf that Article should also
include details of the ages and sexes of specimens se-
parately for each species, and the purposes for which
they were killed, captured, marked or banded, in areas
specified by their geographical coordinates.

2.   Recognising the role of the Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR) as defined in Recommendation
I-IV, the Representatives further welcome the decision
of SCAR to study the status of species, their need for
protection and numbers of each species which might be
harvested for food, study or other uses, as outlined in
paragraph 1 (b) and (c) of Article XII of the Agreed
Measures.
