SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: ROOKERY ISLANDS

The Representatives, considering that Rookery Islands
contain breeding colonies of all six bird species resident
in the Mawson area, two of which, the Giant Petrel (Macro-
nectes giganteus) and the Cape Pigeon (Daption capensis)
occur nowhere else in the region, and that it is of scien-
tific importance to safeguard this unusual association of
six species and to preserve a sample of their habitat, re-
commend to their Governments that the following be inserted
in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures
for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA N° 2

ROOKERY ISLANDS, HOLME BAY

Lat. 67°37'S., Long. 62°33'E.

in the rectangle marked on the attached map.
