DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Replacement of Recommendation III - VII

November 7, 1966

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that 
the following text replace the text of Recommendation III - VII 
adopted at the Third Consultative Meeting:

"III - VII
"Acceptance of Approved Recommendations

"Considering that, in becoming Parties to the Antarctic 
Treaty, States bind themselves to carry out its provisions and 
to uphold its purposes and principles;

"Taking into account that Recommendations which become 
effective in accordance with Article IX of the Treaty are, in 
terms of that Article, 'measures in furtherance of the princi-
ples and objectives of the Treaty';

"Considering further that Recommendations which prescri-
be practices to be followed in Antarctica are an essential part 
of the overall structure of cooperation established by the Treaty;

"Recognising that Approved Recommendations which prescri-
be practices to be followed in Antarctica must be viewed in the 
light of the obligations assumed under Article X of the Treaty;

and

"Recognising further that in pursuance of the principles 
and objectives of the Treaty there should be uniformity of prac-
tice in the activity of all Parties active in Antarctica;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that 
all Parties by accession be urged to notify formally the Con-
sultative Parties of their acceptance of those Approved Re-
commendations which prescribe practices to be followed under 
the Antarctic Treaty and of their intention to apply and be 
bound by the specific provisions of the Recommendations so 
accepted".
