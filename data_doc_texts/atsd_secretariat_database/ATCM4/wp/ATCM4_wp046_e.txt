DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY AUSTRALIA

AGENDA ITEM 6: ANNEXES TO THE AGREED MEASURES FOR
THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA

Specially Protected Areas:  Taylor Rookery

10 November 1966

The Representatives, considering that Taylor Rookery contains
a colony of Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) which is one
of the few, and probably the largest, of the known colonies of
this species located wholly on land, recommend to their Govern-
ments that the following be inserted in annex B, Specially Pro-
tected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of An-
tarctic Fauna and Flora:

Specially Protected Area No 1.
Taylor Rookery, Mac Robertson Land,
Lat. 67°26'S., Long.60°50'E.

DESCRIPTION:  The area consists of the whole of the northern
most rock exposure on the eastern side of Taylor Glacier.
The area is shown on the attached map.
