PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY AUSTRALIA

AGENDA ITEM 6: ANNEXES TO THE AGREED MEASURES
FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA

7 NOV. 1966

In conformity with Article VIII of Recommendation III-VIII
and taking into account the deliberations of IX SCAR, the Austra-
lian delegation proposes that the Consultative Meeting recommend
to Governments the inclusion in Annex B of the Agreed Measures
of those areas recommended by SCAR.

    Attached are more precise definitions of certain areas
in which Australian scientists are active.

    The Australian delegation suggests that a working group
be set up to consider the definitions. Illustrative maps are
available for use by such a working group.
