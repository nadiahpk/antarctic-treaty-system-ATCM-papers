INTERIM GUIDE LINES FOR THE VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF
ANTARCTIC PELAGIC SEALING

Recognizing that the seal stocks in the Treaty Area are a
fishery resource of potential value which at some future date
may require a binding international agreement for its effective
regulation;

Recognizing that this resource should not be needlessly
depleted by over-exploitation, and hence that any harvesting
should be regulated at or below the level of the maximum sus-
tainable yield;

Recognizing that in order to improve scientific knowledge
and so place exploitation on a more rational basis, every effort
should be made both to encourage biological research on these
seal populations and to gain information from the statistics of
sealing operation;

Desiring within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty to
promote and achieve the objectives of protection, scientific
study and rational use of antarctic seals;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that
in implementing Recommendation III-XI each Government should
voluntarily take account of the following Interim Guide Lines
for the Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing:

1. The total number of seals of each species taken in the
Treaty Area should not exceed the maximum sustainable yield of
that species in the Treaty Area;

2. The maximum sustainable yield of each species in the
Treaty Area should be regarded as the number of each species
specified in Annex A;

3.  If the number of seals taken in any locality in any
year is such as to disturb the natural ccological system in that
locality, no seals should be taken therein until the balance of
that system has been restored and in any case until one year
has elapsed;

4.  When it appears to any Consultative Party that the har-
vest of any spccies of scal in the Treaty Area is approaching
the maximum sustainable yield therein, or in any locality is
disturbing the ecological system therein, that party may pro-
pose through diplomatic channels that a Consultative Meeting
be convened under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.  If all
Consultative Parties so agree, such a Meeting shall be convened
as soon as possible to consider the situation and the steps it
may be necessary to take;

5..  A scal may not be killed or taken when it is in the
water;

6.  The Ross Seal, (Ommatophoca rossi), should not be killed
or taken except for scientific purposes;

7.  For the purpose of these Interim Guide Lines, the Treaty
Area should be divided into the zones set out in Annex B.  In the
period from 1 July to 30 June following the establishment of
zones, and thereafter in alternate years, the killing and taking
of seals should be permitted only in the zones listed in Part I
of Annex B.  In other years killing and taking of seals should
be permitted only in the zones listed in Part II of Annex B;

8.  Governments should take appropriate action in accordance
with these Interim Guide Lines, permits being one possibility;

9.  Each Government should provide the other Contracting
Governments before 31 October of each year with the following
information relating to the preceding period of 1 July to 30
June:

    (a) the number, for each species, of adult males, of adult
females, of pregnant females, and of pups killed; and

    (b) the locations where these seals were taken;

10.  At the same time each Government should provide to the
Contracting Governments information on steps it has taken on the
implementation of these Interim Guide Lines.
