STATUS OF MEETINGS OF EXPERTS

(Australian proposed re-draft of the operative paragraphs of
United States Working Paper circulated on 6 September-Doct. 4)

The Representatives recommend to their governments:

1.-  That Meetings of Experts be convened from time to time as
the need arises to discuss practical problems relating to
activity in Antarctica. Such meetings may be attended by ex-
perts from any Party entitled to participate in Consultative
Meetings. With the agreement of all the Consultative Parties
independent experts may be invited to attend in an advisory
capacity;

2.-  That following a decision by a Consultative Meeting or agree-
ement between all Consultative Parties that a meeting of ex-
perts is required with certain specific objectives, the detailed
agenda and date should be established by agreement between all
those Consultative Parties who wish to participate in such a
Meeting;

3.-  That these Meetings of Experts exchange views on the subject
of their meeting and, whenever it is found useful to do so,
work out cooperative arrangements at the technical or operational
level. Unless the Consultative Parties have specifically direct-
ed otherwise, Recommendations would not be submitted to Govern-
ments for approval under Article IX of the Treaty;

4.-  That any such arrangement agreed to at the expert level and
later put into practice may be modified by appropriate con-
sultations between those concerned;

5.-  That those attending the Meetings of Experts report the re-
sults of those Meetings to appropriate authorities in their
respective governments;

6.-  That where the Expert Meeting has been so directed by the
Consultative Parties, or if any Consultative Party judges
that a subject dealt with by a Meeting of Experts warrants formal
agreement, a draft Recommendation be submitted to a subsequent
Consultative Meeting.
