EXPLANATORY STATEMENT
CONCERNING RECOMMENDATION III - VII

November 17, 1966

During their discussion of Recommendation III-VII, under which Parties by accession would be urged or invited to accept Approved Recommendations, Representatives to the Fourth Consultative Meeting agreed that the following considerations are pertinent to the application of Recommendation III-VII:

1. In becoming Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, States bind themselves to carry out its provisions and to uphold its purposes and principles;

2. Recommendations which become effective in accordance with Article IX of the Treaty are, in terms of that Article, "measures in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty";

3. Approved Recommendations are an essential part of the overall structure of cooperation established by the Treaty;

4. In pursuance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty there should be uniformity of practice in the activity of all Parties active in Antarctica; and

5. Approved Recommendations are to be viewed in the light of the obligations assumed by Contracting Parties under the Treaty and in particular Article X.

The Representatives agreed that the above considerations constitute a statement to be appended to Recommendation III-VII and that references to Recommendation III-VII should include a reference to the above statement.
