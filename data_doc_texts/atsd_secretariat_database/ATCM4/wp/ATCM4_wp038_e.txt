NEW ZEALAND - UNITED STATES WORKING PAPER

ANNEXES TO THE AGREED MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC
FAUNA AND FLORA

November 7, 1966

Taking into account the scientific views expressed at the
9th Meeting of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR) in September 1966, New Zealand and the United States
jointly wish to propose all species of the genus Arctocephalus,
fur seals, and the species, Ommatophoca rossi, Ross Seal, for
listing in Annex A, Specially Protected Species, of the Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

Further taking into account the scientific views of the 9th
SCAR Meeting, New Zealand and the United States wish to propose
areas in the Ross Sea - Victoria Land region which
are described in the attached documents, where scientists of
both countries have cooperated together in conducting biological
research, for listing in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of
the Agreed Measures.

ANNEX N° 1

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA N°. ...
SABRINA ISLAND, BALLENY ISLANDS,
Lat. 66° 54'S., Long. 163° 20'E.

DESCRIPTION:  The Balleny Islands, the most northerly Antarctic 
land in the Ross Sea region, support a fauna and flora which re-
flects many circumpolar distributions at this latitude.  Sabrina 
Island has a representative sample of this fauna and flora.

ANNEX N° 2

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA N°....

BEAUFORT ISLAND, ROSS SEA,
Lat. 76° 58'S., Long. 167° 03'E.

DESCRIPTION: Beaufort Island measures 6 kilometres by 3 kilo-
meters and is located 20 nautical miles north of Ross Island.

Beaufort Island contains a substantial, varied avifauna,
and is one of the most important breeding grounds in the re-
gion. It is protected to preserve the natural ecological system
as a reference area.

ANNEX N°. 3

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA N°. ...

CAPE CROZIER, TOSS ISLAND,
Lat. 77° 31'S., Long. 169° 19'E.

DESCRIPTION: The Area comprises all the land on the coast of 
Ross Island east of a line joining the summits of Post Office 
Hill and Bomb Peak, north of a line which bears 90°True from 
Bomb Peak to the coast and north east of a line which bears 315° 
True from. Post Office Hill to the coast; the Area is also deemed 
to include the locality occupied at any time by the rockery of 
Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) immediately adjacent 
thereto. Williamson Rock is also included in the Area.

Cape Crozier supports a rich bird and mammal fauna as well 
as microfauna and flora. The ecosystem depends upon a substan-
tial mixing of marine and terrestrial elements of outstanding 
scientific interest.

ANNEX N° 4

SP:CIALLY PROTECTED AREA N°. ....

CAPE HALLETT, VICTORIA LAND,
Lat. 72° 18'S.; Long. 170° 19'E.

DESCRIPTION: The Area between the eastern side of the road 
which runs along the eastern side of Willett Cove and the west-
ern margin of the permanent ice sheet, to the south of a line 
from the road to the margin of the permanent ice sheet at the 
latitude of the head of Willett Cove, and to the north of a line 
from the road to the margin of the permanent ice sheet drawn 
350 meters to the south of that latitude and parallel to it.

The Area includes a small patch of particularly rich and 
diverse vegetation which supports a variety of terrestrial fau-
na. The ecosystem also includes a rich avian fauna and preserves 
an area of outstanding scientific interest.
