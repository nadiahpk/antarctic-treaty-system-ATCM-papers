AGENDA ITEM N° 11

Effects of Tourism in Antarctica

Considering that tourism is not mentioned in the Antarctic
Treaty, but recognizing that tourist activities may affect the
conduct of scientific research, preservation of fauna and flora and
the operation of Antarctic stations, and that the effects of
tourism should not be such as to contravene the provisions of
the Treaty or Recommendations which have become effective,

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that:

1. Notice in accordance with paragraph 10 of Rec. I-VI
should, as regards tourist and other non-scientific ex-
peditions, be furnished through diplomatic channels as
soon as possible to any other Government whose station
is to be visited;

2. A Government should provide on request information re-
garding the conditions upon which it will grant permis-
sion for tourist groups to visit Antarctic stations
which it maintains; and

3. Such permission be withheld unless reasonable assurances
are given of compliance with the provisions of the Trea-
ty and Recommendations which have become effective, and
the conditions applicable at stations visited.
