INTERIM GUIDE LINES FOR THE VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF
ANTARCTIC PELAGIC SEALING

Recognizing that the seal stocks south of 60° South Latitude
are a resource of potential value which at some future date may
require a binding international agreement for its effective regu-
lation;

Recognizing that this resource should not be depleted by
over-exploitation, and hence that any harvesting should be re-
gulated at or below the level of the maximum sustainable yield;

Recognizing that in order to improve scientific knowledge
and so place exploitation on a rational basis, every effort
should be made both to encourage biological research on these
seal populations and to gain information from the statistics of
future sealing operation;

Desiring to promote and achieve the objectives of protec-
tion, scientific study and rational use of Antarctic seals;

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that in
accordance with Recommendation III-XI each Government should
voluntarily take account of the following Interim Guide Lines
for the Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing:

1.      The total number of seals of each species taken in the area
        south of 60° South Latitude Treaty Area should not exceed
        the maximum sustainable yield of that species.

2.      The maximum sustainable yield of each species in the area
        south of 60° South Latitude should be regarded as the num-
        ber of each species specified in Annex A.

3.      If the number of seals taken in any locality in any year
        is such as to disturb the natural ecological system in that
        locality, no seals should be taken therein until the balance
        of that system has been restored and in any case until one
        year has elapsed.

4. A seal should not be killed or taken when it is in the water.

5. The Ross Seal,(Ommatothoca rossi) should not be killed or taken except for scientific purposes.

6. For the purpose of these Interim Guide Lines, the area south of 60o South Latitude should be divided into the zones set out in Annex B.  Seals should be killed or taken only in alternating zones and alternating periods, as set out in Annex B.

7. Each Government should provide the other Contracting Governments before 31 October of each year with the following information relating to the preceding period of 1 July to 30 June:

    (a) the number, for each species, of adult males, of adult females, of pregnant females, and of pups killed or taken; and

    (b) the locations where these seals were killed or taken.

8. At the same time,each Government should provide to the other Contracting Governments information on any steps it has taken in accordance with these Interim Guide Lines.

9. When it appears to any Consultative Party that the harvest of any species of seal in the area south of 60o South Latitude is approaching the maximum sustainable yield therein, or in any locality is disturbing the ecological system therein, that party may propose through diplomatic channels that a Consultative Meeting be convened under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.  If all Consultative Parties so agree, consider the situation and the steps it may be necessary to take.
