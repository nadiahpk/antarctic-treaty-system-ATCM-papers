COOPERATION IN IMPLEMENTING ARTICLE VI OF THE AGREED MEASURES
FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA
(RECOMMENDATION III-VIII)

The Representatives, taking into consideration Article VI
of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna
and Flora (Recommendation III-VIII), recommend to their Govern-
ments that in cases where expeditions of more than one Partici-
pating Government may be working in the same region of the
Treaty area, the Governments involved should arrange to coope-
rate as far as practicable in limiting the issuance of permits
in accordance with Article VI to ensure that the total number
of native mammals and birds killed or captured accords with the
requirements of paragraphs 4 and 7 (b) of Article VI and para-
graph 4 (b) of Article VIII of the Agreed Measures.
