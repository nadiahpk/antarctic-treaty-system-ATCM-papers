MOE ISLAND, SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS,

Lat. 60°45'S., Long. 45°41'W.

DESCRIPTION:    A small island, about 1 kilometre long and 1 
kilometre across, lying about 500 metres southwest of Signy 
Island, South Orkney Islands.  The offlying rocks are not in-
cluded in the area.

Moe Island provides a representative sample of the maritime 
Antarctic ecosystem.  Intensive experimental research on the 
neighbouring Signy Island may alter its ecosystem and Moe Island 
is protected in order to preserve its natural ecological system 
as a control area for future comparison.

SOUTHERN POWELL ISLAND AND ADJACENT ISLANDS, SOUTH
ORKNEY ISLANDS,

Lat. 60o45'S., Long. 45o02'W.

DESCRIPTION: This area in the central South Orkney Islands,
includes that part of Powell Island which is south of the
latitude of the southern summit of John Peaks, together with
the whole of Fredriksen Island, Michelsen Island, Christof-
ferson Island and the unnamed islands lying wi-
thin the rectangle marked on the map.

The area supports substantial vegetation and a conside-
rable bird and mammal fauna. It is a representative sample
of the natural ecology of the South Orkney Islands, rende-
red more important by the presence of the nucleus of an
expanding colony of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis
gazella).

LYNCH ISLAND, SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS

Lat. 60°40'S., Long. 45°38'W.

DESCRIPTION:  A small island, measuring about 500 metres by 
300 metres, in Marshall Bay, off the south coast of Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands.

Lynch Island supports one of the most extensive and dense areas of grass (Deschampsia antarctica) known in the Treaty Area and provides an outstanding example of a rare natural ecological system.

BYERS PENINSULA, LIVINGSTON ISLAND, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS.

Lat. 62°38'S., Long. 61°05'W.

DESCRIPTION: The ice-free peninsula lying to the west of the 
western margin of the permanent ice sheet on Livingston Island.
Window Island is included within the area, but no other off-
lying islands and rocks.

The area supports a considerable diversity of plant and 
animal life, including many invertebrates. Substantial popu-
lations of Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina) and small colo-
nies of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus species) are found on the 
beaches.  Fur Seals breed on Window Island.  The close associa-
tion of such a large variety of Antarctic plants and animals 
within a relatively small area is of outstanding scientific 
interest.

CAPE SHIRREFF, LIVINGSTON ISLAND, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS

Lat. 62o28'S., Long. 60o48'W.

DESCRIPTION:  The ice-free peninsula lying to the north of 
the northern margin of the permanent ice sheet on Livingston 
Island, between Barclay Bay and Hero Bay.

The area supports a considerable diversity of plant and 
animal life, including many invertebrates.  Substantial po-
pulations of Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina) and small 
colonies of Fur Seals (Arctocephalus species) are found on the 
beaches.  The area is of outstanding scientific interest.

FILDES PENINSULA, KING GEORGE ISLAND, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS.
Lat. 62º12'S., Long. 58º58'W.

DESCRIPTION:  The ice-free peninsula lying to the north-west of
Maxwell Bay and west of the margin of the permanent ice sheet
of King George Island, including Ardley Island but no other
off-lying islands or rocks.

   This biologically diverse region, with numerous small
lakes, ice-free in summer, provides a representative sample of
the South Shetland Islands and is an area of outstanding ecolo-
gical interest.

GREEN ISLAND, BERTHELOT ISLANDS, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA

Lat. 65°19'S.,  Long.  64°10'W.

DESCRIPTION:  A small island, measuring about 600 metres by 
400 metres, situated 150 metres to the north of the largest of 
the Berthelot Islands.  The vegetation on Green Island is excep-
tionally rich; probably the most luxuriant anywhere on the west 
side of the Antarctic Peninsula.  In some places the humus is 
2 metres thick.  This area, of outstanding scientific interest,
is protected because it is probably one of the most diverse eco-
systems in Antarctica.

DION ISLANDS, MARGUERITE BAY, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA

Lat. 67°52'S., Long. 68°43'W.

DESCRIPTION:  A group of small, rocky, low-lying islands in
Marguerite Bay, about 15 kilometres south of Adelaide Island.

    The only colony of Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri)
known to exist on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula is
found amongst these islands.  The isolation of this colony from
others of the same species makes it of outstanding scientific
interest.
