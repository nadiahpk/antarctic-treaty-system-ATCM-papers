DRAFT RECOMMENDATION PRESENTED BY CHILE


ITEM 5 OF THE AGENDA


TELECOMMUNICATIONS


Considering the need to keep up to date the traffic system
of radio communications in Antarctica, and the desirability of
being able to transmit observation data from the Antarctic Treaty
Area to the world system for the collection of meteorological
information:


The Representatives recommend to their Governments that,
before the Consultative Meeting scheduled to take place in
Paris in 1968, the Recommendations made by the Washington Meet-
ing be examined in the light of the new data existing on the
subject at the time, and that they consider its inclusion in
the Agenda of that Meeting.
