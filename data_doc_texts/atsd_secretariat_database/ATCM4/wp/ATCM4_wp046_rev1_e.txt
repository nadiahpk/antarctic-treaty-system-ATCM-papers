SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS: TAYLOR ROOKERY

The Representatives, considering that Taylor Rookery contains a colony of Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) which is one of the few, and probably the largest, of the known colonies of this species located wholly on land, recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA N° 1

TAYLOR ROOKERY, MAC.ROBERTSON LAND,
Lat. 67°26'S., Long. 60°50'E.

DESCRIPTION: The Area consists of the whole of the northern most rock exposure on the eastern side of Taylor Glacier. The Area is shown on the attached map.
