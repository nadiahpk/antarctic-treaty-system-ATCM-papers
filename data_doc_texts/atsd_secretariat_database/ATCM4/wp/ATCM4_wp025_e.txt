SUBJECT: MEETING ON LOGISTICS
WORKING PAPER

The Government of Japan has decided to invite to Japan the
meeting on logistics in 1968.

Recognizing importance of international cooperation and co-
ordination on the Antarctic logistic, the Antarctic authority of
the Government of Japan hopes that the meeting will be successful
and fruitful not only for the treaty consultative parties but al-
so for the Antarctic operations carried out by the treaty nations.

In this regard, the Government of Japan carefully conside-
red the results of SCAR Symposium on Antarctic logistics held in
Boulder, USA in 1962 and also the present stand of the newly re-
organized SCAR Working Group on Logistics, which expresses its
deep interest and concern in all technical aspects of Antarctic
logistics.

Further, the Government of Japan paid its attention to the
fact that the invitation for the 10th SCAR Meeting in 1968 made
by Japan was unanimously accepted by the 9th SCAR Meeting held in
Santiago in September, 1966 and that the proposed 10th SCAR
Meeting in Japan will be closely connected with the Second SCAR
Symposium on Antarctic logistics in accordance with the request
expressed by the majority of SCAR logistics experts.

The Japanese Delegation to the 4th Antarctic Treaty Consul-
tative Meeting therefore, would like to propose the following
schedule for the meeting on logistics.

a) At the Second SCAR Symposium on Antarctic Logistics which will
be held in Japan under the auspices of SCAR and the Science
Council of Japan will be discussed all necessary technical as-
pects of Antarctic logistics problems from purely scientific
and technical view points for approximately five days.

b) Immediately following the Second SCAR Symposium, the meeting
on logistics recommended by the previous Consultative Meeting
(the recommendations I-VII, II-V and III-III) will be held to
study and examine the results of both the first SCAR Sympo-
sium in Boulder and the Second one in Japan.

The Meeting will be held for a few days.

c) As for the period of the SCAR Symposium and the Meeting on
logistics the early June of 1968 is suggested, taking into
account  the climate in Japan as well as the convenience of
experts of logistics who have to engage in preparation and im-
plementation of logistics operations in their own national An-
tarctic programs.
