INTEREST OF SCAR IN ANTARCTIC PELAGIC SEALING

Recognizing the initiative already taken by the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) on matters relating to
Antarctic pelagic sealing, and considering its role as defined
in Recommendation I-IV, the Representatives recommend to their
Governments that they encourage SCAR to continue its interest
in those matters and to prepare reports from time to time on
this subject, and especially at this time on the matters that
it considers should be listed in the annexes to the Interim
Guide Lines for the Voluntary Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic
Sealing.
