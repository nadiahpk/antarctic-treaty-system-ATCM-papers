ADDRESS GIVEN BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
FRENCH REPUBLIC AT THE OPENING SESSION OF
THE FOURTH ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE
MEETING

I must first of all, Mr. Chairman, express to you my very
sincere thanks for your welcome which testifies once again to
the warmth of Chilean hospitality which I have experienced through-
out my stay here. The Chilean Government has shown on these oc-
casions the great interest it has in problems which in any way
relate to the Antarctic, in offering Santiago as the setting for
several important international Conferences on this question
-- Meetings of SCAR, Meetings of the Treaty, exhibitions, etc.

It is a great honour and pleasure for me as head of the
French Delegation, to take part in the Fourth Consultative
Meeting with representatives of the eleven countries signatory
to the Antarctic Treaty.

For the fourth time since the signing of the Treaty, we
meet to consider together ways to facilitate the work of our
scientists, our explorers, our scholars, who, imbued with the
same faith, devote themselves to the problems inherent in the
understanding of an area that still holds so many secrets.

The remarkable results obtained so far are evidence of the
spirit of solidarity and co-operation that have animated both
our debates and the work in the field. This intensive co-opera-
tion is seen in the increasingly important exchange of information
between the Missions operating in the Antarctic. It is equally
evidenced by the exchange of scientists between stations of the
different countries met here today. The reconstruction by the
French Government of its base Dumont d'Urville, will not only
permit us to increase our work in Adelaïde Land, but will allow
a growing number of foreign experts to work there.

Thanks to this spirit uf mutual entente which has always
prevailed in the Delegations that have come to these Conferences,
it was possible, at the Brussels Meeting, to discover the ne-
cessary means for the protection of the fauna and flora of this
region.  All who worked at this task were conscious that their
mission was to protect that unique biological domain which the
Antarctic represents.  It is for us to finish this work.  There
is no doubt that we will be able to find, during the days ahead,
ways of conciliating the different viewpoints and concluding
the task we have begun.

It is increasingly bornc in upon us that the men who serve
in this frozen waste, also serve the cause of international un-
derstanding.  There is a certain satisfaction in this for all
those whose interest is in the Antarctic.

It is in this spirit, and ready to go on with the work
undertaken, that the French Delegation will play its part in
this Fourth Meeting.
