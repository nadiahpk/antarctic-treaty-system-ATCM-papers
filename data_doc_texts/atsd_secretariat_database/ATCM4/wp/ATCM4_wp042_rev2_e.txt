Islands is found the only colony of Emperor Penguins (Apteno-
dytes forsteri) known to exist on the west side of the Antarctic 
Peninsula and that the isolation of this colony from others of 
the same species makes it of outstanding scientific interest, 
recommend to their Governments that the following be inserted 
in Annex B, Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for 
the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora:          

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA N° 8

of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna
and Flora:
