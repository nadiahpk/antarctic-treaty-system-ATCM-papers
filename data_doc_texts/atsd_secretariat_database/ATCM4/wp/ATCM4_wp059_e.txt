DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA

UNITED KINGDOM

November 12, 1966

1.    Considering that the Agreed Measures for the Conservation 
      of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, which were adopted under the An-
      tarctic Treaty at the Third Consultative Meeting, have already 
      been approved by some Governments and submitted in other cases 
      for Parliamentary approval;

2.    Noting however that the texts in the four languages are 
      not fully in conformity with each other and that certain ques-
      tions of interpretation have arisen;

3.    Being anxious nonetheless to maintain the progress towards 
      the coming into effect of the Agreed Measures:

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that 
they seek by the most expeditious means, including if necessa-
ry diplomatic channels, to find a solution to the questions re-
ferred to in Paragraph 2 above.
