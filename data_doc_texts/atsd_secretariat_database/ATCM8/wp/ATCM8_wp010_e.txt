MODIFICATIONS TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS
(Draft Recommendation submitted by United States)

The Representatives

Recalling Recommendations III-VIII, VI-8, and VII-2;

Conscious of the need to revise the list of Specially Protected
Areas in the light of experience and the increased degree of
protection they have been afforded;

Mindful of the criteria established by paragraph 1. of
Recommendation VII-2 for the selection of Specially Protected Areas;

Noting with appreciation the responses of SCAR to Paragraph 2
of Recommendation VII-2;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Specially Protected Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13
and 15 be retained with their existing boundaries.

2. Specially Protected Areas 6, 10, 12, 14 and 16 be removed
from the list of Specially Protected Areas.

3. They consider the merits of amending the conditions governing
the issue of a permit to enter a Specially Protected Area so as to
permit entry for other compelling scientific purposes which cannot be
served elsewhere, in addition to the collection of native mammals,
birds and plants, with a view toward further examination of the matter
at the Ninth Consultative Meeting.

4. They invite SCAR, through their national Committees, to con-
tinue the study of this matter and to make suggestions regarding the
establishment of such additional areas as may be desirable to ensure
the inclusion of representative examples of all major Antarctic land
and freshwater ecological systems.
