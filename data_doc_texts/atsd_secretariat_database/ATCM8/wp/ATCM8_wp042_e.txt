ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFETS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION
PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY NEW ZEALAND

Recommend to Governments that:

1. they invite SCAR through their National Committees to:

    (i) make an assessment of available information on 
        possible impact on the environment of the Treaty Area 
        and of other ecosystems dependant on the Antarctic 
        environment if mineral exploration and/or exploitation 
        were to occur there.

        If possible and appropriate Governments may wish to 
        assist their National Committees in this undertaking 
        by providing some scientific and technical experts 
        and finance.

   (ii) continue to coordinate geological and geophysical 
        research programmes in the Antarctic.

  (iii) consider whether further scientific programmes are 
        necessary in pursuit of these objectives.
