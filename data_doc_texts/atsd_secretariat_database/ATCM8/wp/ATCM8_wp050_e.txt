7.       The Meeting considered in Plenary Session all the items 
on the Agenda and appointed three Working Groups, as well as 
informal groups, comprising members of all those Delegations 
wishing to participate, to assist it in reaching conclusions 
on certain items.  The Working Group on items 7 and 8 was 
chaired by Dr. Brian Roberts, Alternate Representative of 
the United Kingdom, that on item 17 by H.E.Mr. K.G. Brennan, 
Representative of Australia, and that on item 18 by 
Mr. James E. Heg, Alternate Representative of the United States.

8.       The Meeting adopted unanimously the following Recommendations,
which are set forth at the end of this Final Report:
- 4 -

Exchanges of information

9. The Meeting adopted Recommendation VIII-6 (Annual 
Exchanges of Information) on the understanding that information 
which continues unchanged need not be provided in subsequent 
years.  In this event, the Report should state that the 
information continues unchanged.
- 6 -

Man's impact on the Antarctic environment

10. The Meeting was greatly concerned to ensure the 
protection of the unique Antarctic environment. Three 
separate measures were adopted under this heading:

to set out a Code of Conduct for Antarctic expeditions and 
station activities (Recommendation VIII-11); to ensure 
that there is no disposal of nuclear waste in the Antarctic 
Treaty Area (Recommendation VIII-12); and to establish 
broad guidelines concerning the responsibilities of States 
active in the Antarctic Treaty Area for ensuring the 
protection of the Antarctic environment (Recommendation VIII-13). 
The Meeting expressed its appreciation of the work of the 
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) in 
drawing up the new Code of Conduct. Some delegations felt 
nevertheless that Recommendation VIII-11 could have been 
even stronger and expressed a reservation accordingly. 
Environmental matters will be subject to continuing review 
at future Consultative Meetings.
- 6 -

11. The Representative of Australia, H.E. 
Mr. K.G. Brennan, made a statement (attached at 
Annex I) reiterating his Government's 
opposition to the disposal of nuclear waste 
in the Antarctic Treaty Area.  The other 
Representatives associated themselves with 
this statement.
- 7 -

Implementation of Article IX (4)

12. A Table showing approvals of Recommendations
of previous Consultative Meetings is attached
at Annex II.
- 9 -

Marine living resources

The meeting noted with pleasure that if SCAR should consider
convening a meeting on the conservation of marine living resources
and related matters, the United States Representative offered to
provide facilities for such a meeting in the United States.
- 9 -

ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF
MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION

The Meeting noted that each Government represented at the
Eighth Consultative Meeting opposes actions by any nation
or person for the purpose of commercial exploration  and
exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources while seeking
agreed solutions to the problems raised by the possible
presence of valuable mineral resources in the Antarctic
Treaty Area. The representatives also noted the intention
of their Governments to keep the question under continuing
review in the light of possible actions of other governments.
- 10 -

The representatives welcomed the invitation
of the French Government to hold a special preparatory
meeting, for the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting, in Paris from June 1976.

The purpose of this meeting would be to consider
the legal, political and economic questions that would
arise for the Treaty and its Consultative Parties
if it were deemed that the mineral resources existing
in the Treaty Area could be explored and exploited
without risk.

The representatives thanked the Representative
of France for his proposal and invited him to inform
them as soon as possible, through diplomatic channels,
of the date of the special preparatory meeting.
- 11 -

Next consultative meeting

--  Representatives received with pleasure the invitation 
of  the Representative of the United Kingdom to hold the Ninth 
Consultative Meeting in the United Kingdom, at a time to be 
decided on by the Consultative Parties, and undertook to refer 
the invitation to their  Governments.

--  In this connection, the Representative of South Africa 
made the following statement:

"According to established custom Consultative Meetings 
were held in countries according to the English alphabet. 
In accordance with this established practice the Ninth 
Consultative Meeting should have been hosted by South 
Africa.

South Africa is, however, not in a position to host the 
Ninth Consultative Meeting and therefore welcomes the 
invitation extended by the United Kingdom regarding the 
Ninth Meeting. South Africa, however, reserves its 
position to host the Eleventh Consultative Meeting.

Mr. Chairman, my Delegation wishes to have this 
statement included in the Final Report of the Eighth 
Consultative Meeting".
ANNEX I

STATEMENT BY HIS EXCELLENCY MR. K.G. BRENNAN,
REPRESENTATIVE OF AUSTRALIA, 12 JUNE 1975

The safe disposal or storage of radio-active waste
produced in the course of nuclear energy generation is a problem
facing a number of countries, and the problem seems likely to
increase greatly in magnitude before the end of this century.

It has been suggested in some quarters that isolation
of such wastes from the biosphere for the periods required, up
to 250,000 years, might be effected through burying the waste in
the Antarctic ice sheet.  Such action is expressly forbidden
at present by the Antarctic Treaty.

Australia is concerned that the Antarctic environment
and the surrounding oceans and atmosphere not become contaminated
by radio-active waste.  We are firmly of the view that safe
disposal of radioactive waste in the ice sheet cannot be
guaranteed on the basis of existing scientific knowledge.

In that regard we draw attention to a resolution on the
disposal or storage of radioactive waste in Antarctic, adopted
by the XIII Meeting of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research, and to views expressed by a group of scientific
experts who met in the United Kingdom in September 1974 to
consider the foregoing matters.

In the light of its concern expressed above, and the
conclusions reached by the group of scientific experts already
referred to, Australia would firmly oppose any move to permit
the disposal or storage of radioactive waste in the Antarctic
ice sheet.

ANNEX III

Message from the VIIIth Consultative Treaty Meeting
to All Stations in the Antarctic.

Representatives of the Signatories to the Antarctic
Treaty, currently meeting at 60 degrees North Latitude in Oslo
as guests of the Norwegian Government, are now enjoying the
warmth of the midnight sun and are reminded of the very opposite
conditions prevailing in the Antarctic.

Delegates are conscious and appreciative of the out-
standing work that continues in the Antarctic throughout the
long and arduous winter might. We send you our cordial greetings
on this special occasion marking the austral mid-winter day
of 1975 and wish all of you who are wintering-over continued
success in your scientific endeavors in the Antarctic.
