Management Plan for Byers Peninsula.

1.- Description of the Site.

The proposed area is most of the southwest coast
of Byers Peninsula. It has a maximum width of 1 Km. The estima-
ted area covered is about 20 Km. The access to this site is usua-
lly by boat, in some occassions it may be by helicopter. The map

This has been given in Ant. 20 under heading 10.

3.- Outline of proposed Research.

The objectives of the studies are the knowledge
of past floral and faunal associations and the determination of
the types of sediments. This will contribute to our understanding
of the Jurasic and Cretaceous flora and fauna and possible relation-
ships     to that of southern continents adjacent to Antartica.
Therefore the emphasis will be on Paleontology and Sedimentology.

subject to renewal according to SCAR recomendations on Ant 2.
