SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

(Draft Recommendation submitted by the Working Group on
Agenda Items 7 and 8)

The Representatives,

Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendation
VII-3;

Conscious of the need to protect scientific investigations which
might suffer from wilful or accidental interference;

Desiring to protect only sites where harmful interference is
generally recognised to be likely;

Recognising the need to protect such scientific investigations
irrespective of their purpose;

Recognising that a limited number of sites of outstanding
scientific interest may require long-term protection from harmful
interference;

Noting with appreciation the interim response of SCAR to
paragraph 1 of Recommendation VII-3;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to
have regard to the following when considering proposals
for Sites of Special Scientific Interest:

    (a) Sites should only be proposed when:

        (i) scientific investigations are being carried out
or are planned to begin before the following
meeting of SCAR, and there is a demonstrable
- 2 -

risk of interference which would jeopardise 
those scientific investigations; or

(ii) they are of exceptional scientific interest 
and therefore require long-term protection from 
harmful interference;

(b) Sites should be proposed for designation up to a 
specified date which may be extended following a review 
by SCAR;

(c) Proposals for the designation of Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest should be accompanied by a 
management plan which should include, inter alia, and 
where applicable, the following details:

    (i) a description of the Site together with a map 
delimiting its boundaries, and, where applicable, 
indicating any existing or proposed demarkation 
on the Site;

   (ii) a statement setting out the reasons why, in 
accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) (i) and (ii) 
above, the Site should be designated;

   (iii) a summary of the scientific investigations 
being carried out or proposed;

   (iv) the proposed date at which the designation will 
expire unless extended;

    (v) proposed access points;

   (vi) any proposed pedestrian and vehicular routes;

   (vii) other kinds of scientific investigation which 
would not cause harmful interference with the 
investigations described at (c)(iii) above;

(viii)whether specific kinds of scientific sampling 
may take place and guidelines for such sampling;

   (ix) any other restraints that may be needed.

2. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to 
initiate review of those Sites whose designation is likely 
./3.
- 3 -

to terminate before the second following Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting;

3. They request those national offices responsible for the
administration of Antarctic expeditions; to maintain a
record of activities within each Site of Special Scientific
Interest in which their scientists are active;

4. That persons wishing to visit Sites of Special Scientific
Interest should consult their national office responsible
for administering their Antarctic expedition;

5. Until such time as the Recommendations designating Sites
of Special Scientific Interest become effective in accordance
with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, they shall, as
far as is feasible, be considered as guidelines.
