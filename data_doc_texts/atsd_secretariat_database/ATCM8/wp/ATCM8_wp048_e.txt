DRAFT TEXT FOR LETTER FROM AMBASSADOR EDVARD HAMRO TO
MR MAURICE STRONG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNEP, NAIROBI.

Thank you for your telegram about UNEP's interest in
the Antarctic environment which I circulated at the
Eighth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting held in
Oslo from 9 to 20 June.

While chairing this meeting it was made clear to
me how conscious are the Antarctic Treaty governments
of their responsibilities for the protection of the
Antarctic environment against undue disturbance.  The
point was made that this, in a sense, is what the
Antarctic Treaty is about; the governments concerned
are keenly aware of the need to foresee the possible
harmful effects activities may have in the Treaty Area
and to guard against them. I enclose copies of two
Recommendations (VIII-    and VIII-  ), adopted at
the meeting, which are particularly concerned with
Antarctic environmental questions.

You will see from Recommendation VIII-    that the
Representatives took note of your telegram, welcomed
UNEP's interest and recommended to their governments
that the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)
should continue to cooperate with the Scientific Committee
- 2 -

on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE). I think this 
makes good sense.  The environmental problems of the 
Antarctic are very largely for the scientists to 
foresee, measure, assess and suggest counter-action 
where necessary.  SCAR, with its working groups, 
undoubtedly assembles or can consult a complete spectrum 
of scientific expertise on Antarctic matters and I 
expect the dialogue between SCAR and SCOPE to te 
fruitful for all concerned.
