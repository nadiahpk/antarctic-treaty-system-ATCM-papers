E
MARINE LIVING RESOURCES IN ANTARCTICA
(Draft Recommendation submitted by United States)

The Representatives,

Recalling Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty;

Convinced that the Antarctic Treaty Area contains significant
concentrations of exploitable living marine resources;

Recognizing the need to develop measures for the conservation
of these living marine resources;

Aware of the inadequacy of the information concerning the
stocks of these living resources and of the need to develop a good
scientific foundation as the basis for conservation measures.

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They initiate or expand, within their Antarctic
scientific programs, in-depth studies of the biology, distribution
bio-mass and population dynamics of the marine living resources
in Antarctica;

2. They undertake to enhance international cooperation among
the Treaty Parties in scientific studies of the marine living
resources in Antarctica;

3. They make available to SCAR, on an annual basis, all
catch statistics which they develop relating to the marine living
resources in Antarctica;

4. They lend their support to the development and conduct of a
coordinated International Biological Investigation of the Southern
Ocean (IBISO);
5. They urge SCAR, through their national committees, to
continue its work on this important subject;

6. They study the subject further with a view to its inclusion
on the Agenda of the Ninth Consultative Meeting.
