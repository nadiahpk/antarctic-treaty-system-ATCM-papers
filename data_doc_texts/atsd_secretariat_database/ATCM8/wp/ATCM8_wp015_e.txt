AIRBUS

AN INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION
SYSTEM IN ANTARCTICA

(Discussion Paper submitted by United States)

Background

The concept of an international, non-commercial air transportation
system in Antarctica is now new. However, increased attention has
been focused on the subject since the adoption of Recommendation VII-8
at the Seventh Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty. At that
meeting, South Africa placed Cooperation in Transport on the Agenda.
The United States introduced a working paper intended to stimulate
further discussion of the subject. Recommendation VII-8 endorsed the
concept of cooperative use of air and sea transportation systems.

Subsequently, at the XIII Meeting of SCAR in 1974, the Working
Group on Logistics held discussions on a cooperative air transport
system for Antarctica. In addition, a subcommittee on Cooperative
Air Transport was formed to conduct liaison concerning the requirements,
possibilities, and developments in cooperative air transport in
Antarctica. The purposes of this working paper are to update the
original working papers presented by the United States and to include
ideas and terms of reference developed at the SCAR meeting. It is
intended that further discussion on this concept can produce sub-
stantive results in support of Agenda Item 12 at the Eighth
Consultative Meeting.
Objectives

The objectives of an international air transportation system 
in Antarctica are:

a. To facilitate research by providing access throughout the 
austral summer to all parts of Antarctica for scientists and 
technical support personnel from all nations conducting research 
on the continent.

b. To provide access during the austral winter to selected 
antarctic stations for special, high priority missions.

c. To enhance cooperation among the nations signatory to the 
Antarctic Treaty.

d. To foster the growth of mutual reliance among parties to 
the Antarctic Treaty.

Advantages to Science

The advantages of an airbus system to the scientific community 
are significant. The airbus system would facilitate research by 
placing scientists and their support in the field on schedules that 
permit the most economical use of their time. The LC-130 Hercules 
and effective short range ski-equipped airplanes have revolutionized 
air travel throughout the vast expanses of Antarctica. Whereas weeks 
and often months were required to travel by dog sled, tractors, and 
snow vehicles from one point to another, and additional months were 
consumed in travel to the continent of Antaretica, hundreds of miles 
can now be spanned in hours, with passengers and cargo warm and secure 
within the aircraft. The experience of recent years has demonstrated
the special intracontinental versatility of the LC-130 Hercules, which 
operates not only from prepared landing areas but also from unprepared 
"open field" locations on the icecap, placing scientists and their 
camps in remote areas.  This flexibility has attracted many experts 
in various fields who previously were unable to work in Antarctica 
owing to the large time requirements involved in gaining access to 
data. All research programs that depend on access during the austral 
summer period--geology, glaciology, biology--would benefit.  For 
some portions of the antarctic continent, a year-round access may 
be feasible, aiding in the conduct of special studies in the 
atmospheric sciences at locations such as Siple and Dumont d'Urville. 
Equally important is the prospect of placing scientists in the field 
to conduct studies in the pack ice zone around Antarctica, a region 
to which they could deploy by aircraft, surface effect vehicles, or 
other transport means.  Remote sensing studies, which require both 
aircraft and trained observers, would be facilitated by the develop-
ment of the continent-wide network of aviation support facilities.

The already substantial international interest in cooperation 
in scientific researen and data exchange would be strengthened.  This 
would be realized through the improved access for cooperation and 
exchange between stations made possible by this expanded logistic 
support system.

Concept

The ainbus system would be composed of:

a. Long range, intercontinental airplanes for access to 
Antarctica from outer terminals.
b. Medium range airplanes such as the LC-130R Hercules,
Breguet 941 STOL transport, and IL-14.

c. Smaller feeder aircraft such as helicopers and the De
Havilland Twin Otter.

d. A number of intercontinental, intracontinental, and
satellite air terminals.

e. A logistic system to support the concept.

f. All aircraft in the system should be either turbojet or
turboprop powered in order to simplify the required fuel support.

Operation of the long range, intercontinental airplane is beyond
the scope of this working paper. However, facilities at the access
terminals in Antarctica must be considered in follow-up planning.

Medium range and feeder aircraft assets either available or
potentially available for use in Antarctica are considerable.  A

Note:  Some helieopters are ship based.
Within the capability of present aircraft and facilities, the 
southward approach to Antarctica is through Christchurch, New Zealand; 
Punta Arenas, Chile and various airfields in southern Argentina. 
South Africa and Australia also serve as "jumping off" points but 
current facilities at the antarctic end, terminal weather forecasting, 
and other considerations have limited the development of the South 
Africa-Antarctica and Australia-Antarctica airlinks.

From New Zealand, the entry into Antarctica is through the 
United States station at McMurdo where basic facilities are available 
to receive and maintain aircraft, both wheeled and ski-equipped. 
McMurdo also can house and subsist incoming passengers and handle 
cargo.  The station, is presently the only station in Antarctica with 
such a complete range of services.

The other intercontinental approach presently available is 
from South America, with flights terminating at Marambio Station, 
Seymour Island (64°17'S 56°45'W) on the Antarctic Peninsula.  The 
present facilities on Seymour Island are not adequate for large scale 
air operations such as are conducted at McMurdo, but it is feasible 
to develop an adequate air facility there as a way for continuing 
flights into the Antarctic continent.  It is reported that a 2,000 
meter aluminum matting runway is planned.

It was also reported to the SCAR Working Group on Logistics that 
the USSR plans to construct a hard surface runway for long range 
wheeled aircraft at Molodezhnaya Station.  This improvement project 
should result in a third major intercontinental access terminal 
to Antarctica from South Africa.
From these three access terminals all major stations in
Antarctica could be served by some element of the airbus system.

Given adequate surface conditions for landing and take off, every 
permanent scientific station on the continent is within the 
unrefueled operating radius of an LC-130R aircraft making an 
initial wheel take-off with a 10 ton payload. In addition, of the 
entire continent, only an area of about 35,000 square miles between 
Casey Station and Mirnyy Station lies outside of this operating radius.

The several intracontinental terminals would serve as points 
from which feeder aircraft could economically operate to provide air 
service to all parts of Antarctica. The minimum number of large 
terminals supporting the "feeder" service to other stations as con-
ceived for the operation of the C-130, are:

    Seymour Island (Argentina)
    Halley Bay (United Kingdom)
    Molodezhnaya (USSR)
    McMurdo (USA)

Prepared skiways are critical to the economical utilization of 
ski aircraft for maximum gross-weight operations. Wheel runways are 
desirable wherever they can be developed, since they allow even 
greater payloads. The four stations listed above are at locations 
suitable for the construction of runways or skiways necessary for 
the operation of large heavy aircraft; some already have developed 
facilities. Another important consideration for economical operation 
of the four major intracontinental terminals is the ability to deliver 
aviation fuel to the site by ship.
The system would require:  (a) the establishment of a number of 
major skiways/runways on the continent and periodic scheduling of 
services to them, and (b) the initiation of an inter-station "feeder 
line" service between the major terminals and all other stations, as 
well as field locations.

Weather data gathering and processing, together with improved 
international communications, would be required to operate the air 
services and to provide for the safety of planes and passengers.

Further, more common fuel and fueling systems would be required, as 
well as coordinated communication and aviation operating procedures.

The sharing of resources for the flight support of all scientists 
in Antarctica would not create an undue burden on the resources of 
any nation.  Nor would the provision of the required fueling and 
aircraft servicing capabilities be a major burden if these capabilities 
were developed over a period of several antarctic seasons with each 
nation concentrating on the further development of its present 
capability.  The key to the establishment of such a transportation 
system is international cooperation.  Too parochial an attitude on 
the part of any interested party would defeat the purpose of the 
effort and result in a status quo.

Once the facilities are established, the overall transportation 
system could commence operation.  Representative time/distance factors 
from the proposed major intracontinental terminals are presented in 
Table 1.
Table 2 contains some basic performance figures for the LC-130R airplane. A comparison of Tables 1 and 2 leads to the following observation:

a. Myrnyy and Casey are the only two permanent stations that are not within unrefueled radius (ski configuration) of the LC-130R airplane operating from one of the four major intracontinental terminals.

b. All stations are within the unrefueled radius (wheel configuration) of the LC-130R airplane operating from one of the three intercontinental terminals.

c. All of the three intercontinental terminals are within range (wheel configuration) of each other.

d. All of the four intracontinental terminals are within range (ski configuration) of at least one of the other terminals.

e. All stations are within range (ski configuration) from one of the four intracontinental terminals.

f. The LC-130R airplane, or another type with equivalent performance and capability, could provide the intracontinental service envisioned in the airbus concept.

A sample monthly LC-130R airbus schedule is contained in Table 3.

Scientists delivered to any of the stations serviced could then be placed in field locations by feeder aircraft. It would of course be necessary to determine in advance the need for each scheduled shuttle and for each stop on the shuttle. The following factors were considered in developing the semple schedule:
a. Five LC-130R airplanes assigned.
b. Three LC-130R airplanes available on any one day.
c. Season of November through February.
d. Each shuttle operates once a month.
e. Six day work week.
f. Seventy-two airplane days available per month.
g. Airbus shuttle requires 11 airplane days per month (maximum).
h. All stations serviced monthly.

Implementation

Further development of the cooperative air transport concept 
preliminary to implementation of the system will be facilitated by 
the concerted efforts of the Subcommittee on Cooperative Air Transport 
of the SCAR Working Group on Logistics. The Subcommittee membership 
includes the Working Group representatives from Argentina, Australia, 
France, the USSR, and the USA with the USA representative acting as 
Chairman. This group will:

    a. Attempt to determine the actual needs, relative priorities, 
and opportunities for coordination and cooperation in air transport 
activities.

    b. Consid?r reciprocal contributions, such as various supplies, 
equipment, or services, that would be made by all nations participating 
in the use of the airbus system. The contributions would be approxi-
mately in proportion to the use made of the system so as to offset the 
burden on the nations primarily responsible for operating the system.
c. Consider the need for development of electronic aids to 
navigation, operational communications services, facilities for 
search and rescue, fuel storage and delivery systems and facilities 
for aircrew and passengers.

d. Consider coordination and cooperative arrangements for 
sea transport and aviation fuel supply operations insofar as they 
relate to the operation of a cooperative air transport system.

In particular, it will be necessary to generate a detailed 
inventory of existing and planned aviation resources and ground 
support facilities. The air transport system requirements which are 
not covered by the inventory will then be the subject of additional 
planning. SCAR should then attempt to influence their respective 
national sponsors to provide the necessary resources to establish 
the airbus system. A strong, substantive recommendation from the 
Eighth Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty would do much to 
insure the successful planning development and implementation of the 
airbus concept. In the interim, cooperative air transport operations 
would continue to be the subject of various bilateral arrangements.
