SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
(Proposal submitted by New Zealand)

 SITE 2

Arrival Heights, Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island

Latitude 77° 49' 45" S, Longitude 166° 39' 30" East.

General Description

This area is an electromagnetically and natural "quiet
site" offering ideal conditions for the installation of
sensitive instruments for recording minute signals usually
associated with upper atmosphere programmes. Current New
Zealand research programmes being undertaken in this area
are Auroral and Geomagnetic studies and the following
equipment is installed in huts:-

All sky camera
Essa micropulsation recording equipment
Photometer
Multiband receivers for recording from
satellites.

No R.F. radiating equipment such as radio transmitters and
ionosondes has been permitted in the area.

Area to be designated "Site of Special Scientific Interest"

All that area of Arrival Heights enclosed within a
line drawn from Trig T510 north-west over First Crater to
the 500 foot contour, then north along this contour to a
point immediately west of Second Crater around the lip of
this crater and south to T510.

sensitive (some light sensitive during hours of darkness)
continuous recording instruments. The huts are not manned
continuously for only periodic visits are required to change
recorder charts and tapes and check on the equipment.

Limitations on Access and Activities

1. To minimise interference to the scientific programmes
it is essential that movement of vehicles or personnel other
than those directly concerned with the scientific programme
be restricted. Therefore only personnel who have received
prior permission from the Officer in Charge, Scott Base will
be permitted within the Arrival Heights Site of Special
Scientific Interest.

2. No R.F. transmitting equipment other than low power
transceivers for local essential communication may be installed
within this Site.
3.  Every precaution is to be taken to ensure that 
electrical equipment is adequately suppressed and correctly 
installed and so keep man-made electrical noise to an 
absolute minimum.

4.  The Officer in Charge, Scott Base will have the 
continuing responsibility for keeping the Site adequately 
marked and sign-posted.

Period of Designation as Site of Special 
Scientific Interest

Indefinite.
