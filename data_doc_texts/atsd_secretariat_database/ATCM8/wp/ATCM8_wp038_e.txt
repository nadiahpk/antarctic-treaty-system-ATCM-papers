SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST:
SITE NO. 2, ARRIVAL HEIGHTS, HUTT POINT PENINSULA, ROSS ISLAND
(Draft management plan submitted by the Working Group
on Agenda Items 7 and 8 to be annexed to the draft
Recommendation in ANT/35).

(i)     Description of Site

All that area of Arrival Heights enclosed within a line
drawn from Trig T510 north-west over First Crater to the
500 foot contour, then north along this contour to a
point immediately west of Second Crater around the lip of
this crater and south to T510. The boundary, which is
demarkated, is shown on the attached map.

(ii)    Reason for designation

This area is an electromagnetically and natural "quiet site"
offering ideal conditions for the installation of sensitive
instruments for recording minute signals associated with
upper atmosphere programmes.

(iii)   Outline of research

Upper atmosphere investigations associated with auroral and
geomagnetic studies.

(iv)    Date of expiry of designation

30 June 1981.

(v)     Access points

None are defined but movement within the area by vehicles
or personnel other than those directly concerned with the
investigations should be kept to the minimum necessary 
for purposes of implementing the programme.

(vi)  Pedestrian and vehicular routes
Vehicles and pedestrians should keep to the tracks shown 
on the attached map.

(vii) Other kinds of scientific investigations which 
would not cause harmful interference

Scientific investigations other than those associated 
with the upper atmosphere programme should be kept to a 
minimum.

(viii) Scientific sampling
Not applicable.

(ix)  Other restraints
No R.F. transmitting equirment other than low power 
transceivers for local essential communicaticn may be 
installed within this Site.  Every precaution should be 
taken to ensure that electrical equipment is adequately 
suppressed and correctly installed and so keep man-made 
electrical noise to an absolute minimum.
