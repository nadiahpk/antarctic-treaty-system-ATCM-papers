SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST:           
SITE NO. 6, EYERS PENINSULA, LIVINGSTON ISLAND,           
SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS           

(Draft management plan submitted by the Working Group           
on Agenda Items 7 and 8 to be annexed to the draft           
Recommendation in ANT/35)           

(i)     Description of Site           

The Site comprises four areas of sedimentary and           
fossiliferous strata on Eyers Peninsula.  These areas           
are shown on the attached map.           

(ii)    Reason for designation           

The fossils found in this area provide evidence of           
the former link between Antarctica and the other Southern           
Continents.  A long-term paleontological research           
programme is in progress.  It is important to protect           
these Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks from being used as           
building materials or as souvenirs.           

(iii)   Outline of research           

A long-term research programme was established in 1964.           
The main objectives are the description of sediments and           
fossils found in this area.           

(iv)    Date of expiry of designation           

30 June 1981.           

(v)     Access points           

None are defined.           

(vi)    Pedestrian and vehicular routes           

Vehicles should not enter the Site except in an emergency.           
/(vii)
(vii)     Other kinds of scientific investigations which 
would not cause harmful interference.

Scientific research other then geological should be kept 
to a minimum.

(viii)  Scientific sampling

Samples of rocks or biological specimens should only be 
taken for compelling scientific purposes.

(ix)      Other restraints

Buildings and other facilities should not be erected in 
the Site.
