MAN'S IMPACT ON THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
(Draft Recommendation by United States)

The Representatives;

Recalling Recommendations III-VIII, VI-4; and VII-1;

Noting the information provided by the Consultative Parties
about the implementation of "Agreed Measures for the Conservation
of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;"

Mindful of the importance of the Antarctic as a baseline for
measuring changes in the global environment; and

Desiring to minimize the impact of man on the Antarctic
environment;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They adopt as guidelines for the conduct of their
expeditions and station activities, the responses by SCAR to
paragraph 1 of Recommendation VI-4;

2. Through their national committees they urge SCAR to
expedite the development of coordinated scientific programs for
detecting and assessing changes occurring in the Antarctic
environment with the purpose of discussing these programs at the
Ninth Consultative Meeting;

3. They use their best endeavors to ensure that the provisions
of the Treaty and subsequent Recommendations relating to the Con-
servation of Fauna and Flora and to protection of the Antarctic
environment are applied in practice to all members of expeditions
which are not sponsored by the Consultative Parties, including tourists.
