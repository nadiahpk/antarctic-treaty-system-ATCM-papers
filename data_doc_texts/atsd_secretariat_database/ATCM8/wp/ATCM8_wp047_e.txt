ANTARCTIC RESOURCES -- EFFECTS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION
(Working Paper Submitted by the United States)

Introduction

This working paper, recognizing that serious international impact would attend the commencement of commercial
mineral resource exploration in the Antarctic Treaty Area, 
is intended to suggest some of the basic principles of an 
international approach to possible future exploration and 
exploitation of any mineral resources in Antarctica.

The Antarctic Treaty has been a model of international 
cooperation -- a unique example of accommodation of conflicting juridical positions, used for peaceful purposes 
only, promotion of scientific endeavor, and preservation 
of an ecologically sensitive environment.

Although we know too little of the extent of Antarctic 
mineral resources, they have been estimated to be of 
potential commercial significance. In an atmosphere 
of rising prices for raw materials, particularly hydrocarbons, and of unpredictable disruptions of supply patterns, 
pressure to exploit resources in Antarctica may grow 
rapidly. Although exploitation in Antarctic conditions 
would no doubt be difficult and expensive, the same is 
true at present in Arctic regions, and new technological 
developments in exploitation at great depths in unfavorable
