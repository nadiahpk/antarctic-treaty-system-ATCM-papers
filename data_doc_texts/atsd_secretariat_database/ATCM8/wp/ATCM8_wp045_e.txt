map will be demarkated.

The unique fossil ichnolites found in these areas are              
located close to two permanent scientific stations which              
have been visited frequently by tourist groups.  The areas              
also contain representative sequences of Tertiary strata.              

(iii)   Outline of research              

The main object of the research program is to describe              
the Tertiary strategr[?]hic sequences and to understand              
the geological evolution of this part of Antarctic Peninsula.              

(iv)    Date of expiry of designation

/(vii)
(vii)     Other kinds of scientific investigations which

Samples of rocks should only be taken for compelling 
scientific purposes.

(ix)     Other restraints

Buildings and other facilities should be kept outside 
the marked areas.
