THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
(Draft Recommendation submitted by United Kingdom, New Zealand
and United States).

(1) Recognising that prime responsibility for Antarctic
matters, including protection of the Antarctic environment,
lies with the states active in the area who are parties
to the Antarctic Treaty;

(2) Noting the vulnerability of the Antarctic environment
to human interference and that the consequences of major
alterations would be of global significance;

(3) Noting the distance of the Antarctic from the main
sources of environmental pollution and hence its value
for global baseline monitoring purposes;

(4) Considering the role of the Antarctic as a global
climatic regulator of major importance:

(5) Noting that in seeking to fulfil these responsibilities
Antarctic Treaty states have:

(a) negotiated the Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;

(b) negotiated the Convention for the Conservation
of Antarctic Seals (London 1972);

(c) invited the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research (SCAR) of the International Council
of Scientific Unions (ICSU):
(i) to identify the types and assess the extent
of human interference which has occurred
in the Treaty Area as a result of man's
activities;                            /(ii)
-2-

(ii) to propose measures which might be taken 
to minimise harmful interference;

(iii) to consider and recommend scientific 
programmes which will detect and measure 
changes occurring in the Antarctic environment
and that a Code of Conduct for stations and 
activities within the Antarctic Treaty Area to 
minimise their harmful environmental effects 
has been adopted;

(6) Noting that the Antarctic Treaty calls upon signatory 
states to encourage co-operative working relations with 
those specialised agencies of the United Nations and 
other international organisations having a scientific 
or technical interest in the Antarctic;

(7) Noting the cable to the Chairman of the Consultative 
Meeting from the Executive Director of the United 
Nations Environment Program, circulated to the meeting 
on 10 June 1975.

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. In exercising their responsibility for the wise 
use and protection of the Antarctic environment they 
shall have regard to the following:

(a) that in considering measures for the wise use 
and protection of the Antarctic environment 
they shall act in accordance with their

/responsibility
responsibility for ensuring that such measures
are consistent with the interests of all mankind;

(b) that no act or activity having an inherent
tendency to modify the environment over wide      
areas within the Antarctic Treaty Area should be
undertaken unless appropriate steps have been taken
to foresee the probable modifications and to
exercise appropriate controls with respect to
the harmful environmental effects such uses of
the Antarctic Treaty Area may have;

(c) that in cooperation with SCAR and other relevant
agencies they continue      
within the capabilities of their Antarctic
scientific programmes, to monitor changes in the
environment, irrespective of their cause, and to
exercise their responsibility for informing the
world community of any significant changes caused
by man's activities outside the Antarctic Treaty
Area;

2. They welcome the offer made by the United Nations
Environment Program of cooperation in questions of
scientific and technical interest relating to the
Antarctic environment and invite SCAR, through their
National Antarctic Committees, to continue its
participation in the development of the relevant parts
of the programme under consideration by the Scientific
Committee on Problems of the Environment.
