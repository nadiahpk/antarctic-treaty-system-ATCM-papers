SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST. SCAR RESPONSE TO
ANTARCTIC TREATY RECOMMENDATION VII-3.

(SCAR paper submitted by Norway)

In conveying the attached document SCAR requested
the National Committees to inform their Governments of the
likelihood of proposals being made in the future for the
establishment of specially Protected Areas and Sites of
Special Scientific Interest in the McMurdo Dry Valley System
(see paragraph 12 XIII - SCAR - 35, Report of the meetings
of the Working Group on Biology).

SCAR Response to Antarctic Treaty Recommendation VII-3.

Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

The SCAR Working Group on Biology has re-examined the grounds for the establishment of SSSI and the proposals put forward by National Committees and considers that the reasons advanced at XII SCAR for their establishment are still valid. In the light of this re-examination, the Working Group makes the following recommendations:

1.    That each Site be initially established for a specified term of years, the term being such as will enable recommendations for an extension of the term to be approved before expiry of the initial term.

2.    That the list of Sites be reviewed by SCAR at each biennual meeting, with advice from appropriate Working Groups.

3.    That proposals for the establishment of SSSI's be accompanied in each case by a Management Plan.

4.    That Management Plans include the following details:
      a.  A brief description of the site together with a map.

      b.  A statement outlining the reasons for its establishment, including an outline of proposed research.

      c.  Period of designation of the site.

      d.  Details of the activities that will be permitted in the area, including where applicable:
                -  access points
                -  pedestrian and vehicular routes
                -  kinds of scientific activity permitted within the area
                -  areas where specific kinds of scientific sampling may or may not take place, and guidelines on the extent of this sampling.

      e.  Limitations on access

      f.  Any other restrictions.

Management plans should be kept up to date and copies exchanged between SCAR National Committees. A record of activities within the SSSI should be kept as an annex to the plan. Such a record should include information on collections, with any structural alteration to the habitat.

The following proposals concerning Sites of Special Scientific

Interest have been received.

Chile     Port Foster, Deception Island - no documentation.

N.Z.      1. Cape Royds, Ross Island
          2. Arrival Heights, Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island

Japan     The following are listed as possible sites for future 
          recommendation.

          Syowa Station and its vicinity

          1. Mizukumi Stream         at East Ongul Island
          2. Lake O-ike             at West Ongul Island
          3. Lake Nurume             at Long Hovde
          4. Lake Funazoko          at Skavs Nes
          5. Lake Skallen Oike      at Skallen
          6. Heito Glacier          at Lang Hovde

U.K.      1. Byer Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland 
          Islands (at present SPA No. 10) should be redifined 
          as a Site of Special Scientific Interest if 
          requested.

          2. Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands (at present 
          SPA No. 14) should be redefined as a Site of 
          Special Scientific Interest.

          3. Coppermine Peninsula, Robert Island (at present 
          SPA No. 16) should be redefined as a Site of 
          Special Interest if requested.

          4. Signy Island, South Orkney Islands.

SCAR WG   Cape Crozier, Ross Island (at present SPA No. 6).  To 
be Biology redefined as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The Working Group recommends that subject to the preparation 
of documentation of the sites and preparation of management 
plans by the appropriate Working Group member, and the approval 
of these documents by the relevant Working Groups by correspon-
dence, National Committees be invited to propose to their 
Governments that the following sites be considered at the next 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting as Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest.

          1. Cape Royds, Ross Island
          2. Signy Island, South Orkney Islands
          3. Arrival Heights, Hut Point Peninsula, Ross 
          Island (as recommended by the Working Group on 
          Upper Atmosphere Physics)

The Working Group further recommends that, subject to the 
provisos listed above, the following Specially Protected Areas 
be redefined as Sites of Special Scientific Interest:

Specially Protected Areas Nos. 6, 10, 14 and 16.
