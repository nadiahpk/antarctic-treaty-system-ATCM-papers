COOPERATION IN TRANSPORT
(Draft Recommendation by United States)

The Representatives,

Acknowledging the benefits to be derived from international
cooperation in logistics as well as scientific investigations in
the Antarctic Treaty area;

Recognizing (1) that the relative inaccessability of many
regions of the Antarctic creates special transport problems and
research program limitations;

(2) that access to Antarctica by long range aircraft
to a minimum of three terminals combined with intracontinental feeder
routes by medium and smaller aircraft would facilitate new levels of
participation and flexibility in research;

Noting the interest taken by SCAR and the potential for a
cooperative air transport system as indicated in the report of the
Working Group on Logistics;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They accept the principle of using, where appropriate,
common transport facilities by sea and by air for scientific and
other personnel proceeding with their equipment to and from
Antarctic stations;

2. They encourage bilateral or multilateral consultations
betucen Contracting Parties in order to establish when arrangements
for such common use of transport facilities would be mutually
convenient and practicable.
3. They encourage, in particular, the further exchange of 
information on developments, resources, and requirements with 
respect to transport systems through the SCAR Working Group on 
Logistics and its subcommittee on Cooperative Air Transport or 
through other appropriate channels.

4. The cost of the use of any common transport facilities 
should be arranged by agreement between the Contracting Parties 
concerned, either by direct payment, by reciprocation in kind, 
or by other mutually agreed means.
