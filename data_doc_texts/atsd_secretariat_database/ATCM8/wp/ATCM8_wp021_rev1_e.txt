SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST:
SITE NO. 7, HASWELL ISLAND

(Draft management plan submitted by the Working Group
on Agenda Items 7 and 8 to be annexed to the draft
Recommendation in ANT/35).

(i)     Description of Site

The Site consists of Haswell Island (66° 31'S, 93°00'E),
about 1km² in area, the largest of a group of islands
lying close to Mirny station, together with its littoral
zone and the area of fast ice, when present, lying within
the delimitation shown on the attached map to be drawn_7.

(ii)    Reason for designation

The Site is an exceptionally prolific and representative
breeding locality for all the species of birds which occur
in this part of the Antarctic (five species of petrel
(Procellariiformes), one species of skua (Catharacta skua),
and one species of penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)).  The
Site provides exceptional opportunities for research and
needs protection in view of its close proximity to a
large Antarctic station.

/(iii)
(iii) Outline of research

A long-term biological programme associated with the 
bird colonies and studies of the inshore marine biology 
are expected to continue in the Site.

(iv) Date of expiry
30 June 1981.

(v) Access points

The Site may be entered from any direction but should 
cause minimum disturbance to the bird colonics.

(vi) Pedestrian and vehicular routes

Vehicles should not enter the Site. Pedestrians should 
not move through the populated areas except as necessary 
in the course of scientific investigations. Helicopters 
and low-flying aircraft should avoid the bird colonies 
in accordance with the Agreed Measures for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

(vii) Other kinds of scientific investigations which 
would not cause harmful interference

Any scientific investigation which will not cause significant 
disturbance to the biological programmes for which the Site 
has been designated.

(viii) Scientific sampling

Samples of the bird population taken by killing, capture 
or taking of eggs should only be done for a compelling 
scientific purpose and in accordance with the Agreed 
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.
