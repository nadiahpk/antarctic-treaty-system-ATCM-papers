ITEM 17:  DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
(Submitted by The United States)

The Representatives

Recalling Recommendation VII-6;

Noting  the technological developments in polar mineral 
        exploration and exploitation;

Convinced that further consultations on questions 
        concerning Antarctic mineral resources are desir-
        able;

Concerned that mineral resource exploration and 
        exploitation could adversely affect the environment 
        of Antarctica and of other ecosystems dependent on 
        the Antarctic environment;

Resolved  that any mineral resources that may be found 
        in Antarctica in commercial quantities should not 
        become the cause of harm to the sensitive Antarctic 
        environment;

Resolved further  that the Consultative parties should 
        seek an arrangement concerning Antarctic mineral 
        resources based on the principles and purposes of 
        the Antarctic Treaty, having due regard for, interalia, 
        the need to accommodate their respective economic 
        interests;

Recommend  to their Governments

1.  that the subject "Antarctic Resources --
    Effects of Mineral Exploration and Exploitation" 
    be fully studied, including juridical, political 
    and economic aspects, and be the subject of
- 2 -

consultations among them through diplomatic and
other appropriate channels.

2. that their governments undertake to study the
environmental implications of mineral resource
activities in Antarctica and other related matters,
including joint studies among them, and that they
excahnge the results of such studies;

3. they invite SCAR through their National Committees to:

     (i) make an assessment of available information on
possible impact on the environment of the Treaty
Area and other ecosystems dependent on the
Antarctic environment if mineral exploration
and/or exploitation were to occur there.

          If possible and appropriate Governments may wish
to assist their National Committees in this
undertaking by providing some scientific and
technical experts and finance.

     (ii) continue to coordinate geological and geophysical
research programmes in the Antarctic.

     (iii) consider whether further scientific programmes are
necessary in pursuit of these objectives;

4. that the subject "Antarctic Resources --
Effects of Exploration and Exploitation" be placed on
the Agenda of the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting.
