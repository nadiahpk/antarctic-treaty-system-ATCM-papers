AGENDA ITEMS 11 and 12

ACCEPTED PRACTICES AND THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY FOR VISITORS TO THE TREATY AREA
and  AREAS OF SPECIAL TOURIST INTEREST

These items could perhaps best be dealt with in a
single Recommendation under the same title as
Recommendation VII-4, with three Annexes:

DRAFT

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXPEDITIONS TO
THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Recomnising that tourists and other persons not sponsored
by Consultative Parties are visiting the Antarctic Treaty
Area in increasing numbers;

Acknowledging that tourism is a natural development in
this area and that it requires regulation;

Recalling Recommendation VII-4, and particularly the need
to avoid progressive interference with natural ecological
systems which are not yet sufficiently understood;

Reconnising the need to restrict the number of places
where large numbers of tourists may land in order to enable
the ecological effects to be monitored;

Recommend to their Government that:

1. They use their best endeavours to ensure that all
those who enter the Antarctic Treaty Area, including
those sponsored by governments and those not so sponsored,
are aware of the Statement of Accepted Practices and the
Relevant Provisions of the Antarctic Treaty in Annex A to
this Recommendation;
2. They require a71. organizers of tourist groups, except in an emergency, to:

      (a) visit only those Antarctic stations for which 
permission has been sought and granted in 
accordance with Recommendation IV-27;

      (b) Land only within the Areas of Special Tourist
Interest listed or defined in Annex B to this
Recommendation.

3. When granting permission for tourist groups to visit
Antarctic stations which they maintain, Consultative Parties
shall require tour organizers to report their activities
within the Treaty Area. These reports shall be made at the
end of the season to the Consultative Parties whose
stations they have visited, in accordance with the require-
ments listed in Annex C to this Recommendation.

4. They keep Annexes A, B and C to this Recommendation
under review at successive Consultative Meetings.
