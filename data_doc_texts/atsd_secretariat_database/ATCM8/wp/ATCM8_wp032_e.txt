AGENDA ITEM 15: ACTIVITIES OF COUNTRIES NOT PARTIES TO THE TREATY

Draft Recommendation submitted by Argentina

The representatives,

Recalling the provisions and principles of the Antarctic Treaty;

Reaffirming that it is in the interest of all mankind that

Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peace-
ful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international
discord;

Recognizing that the Antarctic Treaty places a special responsi-
bility on the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate efforts, con-
sistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to the end that no
one engages in any activity in the Antarctic Treaty area contrary to
the principles or purposes of the Treaty;

Considering paragraphs 15 to 17 of the Report of the Seventh
Consultative Meeting regarding activities in the Treaty area by
States that are not Contracting Parties;

Considering further that it is necessary for States which are
Parties to the Treaty to adopt existing and future recommendations,
which form an integral part of the Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments:

1. That they reaffirm the principles set forth in paragraphs 15
to 17 of the Report of the Seventh Consultative Meeting in respect of
activities by States that are not Contracting Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty.
-2-

2. That they take the necessary measures to urge or invite, as appropriate, any State or States that have, or will, become Parties to the Antarctic Treaty to comply strictly with past and future recommendations adopted at Consultative Meetings in pursuance of the Treaty, of which they form an integral part, and subsequently approve by the Governments of all the Contracting Parties whose representatives are entitled to participate in those Meetings, and to inform them of their$ rights and benefits as well as their responsibilities and obligations as Contracting Parties.
