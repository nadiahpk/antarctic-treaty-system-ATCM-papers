PERMITS FOR ENTRY TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

Amendment for Resolution VI-8 proposed by a legal working group.

The Representatives,

Noting that Resolution VI-8, paragraph 2, as presently
worded, enables Governments to issue permits for entry to Specially
Protected Areas only under Article VI of the Agreed Measures, for
the collection of mammals or birds, or under Article VIII,
paragraph 2(a), for the collection of plants, on the common
conditions laid down in Article VIII, paragraph 4;

Desiring to extend this faculty to other compelling
scientific purposes;

Recommend to their Governments that the following words
be added at the end of paragraph 2 of Article VII, after a
comma:

"or in accordance with a permit issued for other compelling
scientific purposes, subject to Article VIII, paragraph 4, of the
Agreed Measures;"

PERMITS FOR ENTRY TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS
Alternative text proposed by France, Norway and
the United Kingdom

The Representatives,

Noting that Recommendation VI-8, paragraph 2, and Articles VI
and VIII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Fauna and Flora annexed to Recommendation III-VIII, enable
Governments to issue permits for entry to Specially Protected
Areas only for the collection of native mammals or birds (Article VI)
or plants (Article VIII, paragraph 2(a));

Desiring to extend this facility to include other compelling
scientific purposes;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Recommendation VI-8 be cancelled.

2. The Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Fauna and Flora be modified by the addition of a new subparagraph
to Article VIII, paragraph 2, as follows:

"(c) entry be their nationals, except in accordance with
a permit issued under Article VI or under paragraph
2 (a) of the present Article or in accordance with
a permit issued for some other compelling scientific
purpose."

3. Until such time as the Agreed Measures and this Recommenda-
tion become effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic
Treaty, this Recommendation should, as far as feasible, be con-
sidered as a guideline.
