ANNEX III

Message from the VIIIth Consultative Treaty Meeting 
to All Stations in the Antarctic.

Representatives of the Signatories to the Antarctic 
Treaty, currently meeting at 60 degrees North Latitude in Oslo 
as guests of the Norwegian Government, are now enjoying the 
warmth of the midnight sun and are reminded of the very opposite 
conditions prevailing in the Antarctic.

Delegates are conscious and appreciative of the out-
standing work that continues in the Antarctic throughout the 
long and arduous winter might. We send you our cordial greetings 
on this special occasion marking the austral mid-winter day 
of 1975 and wish all of you who are wintering-over continued 
success in your scientific endeavors in the Antarctic.
