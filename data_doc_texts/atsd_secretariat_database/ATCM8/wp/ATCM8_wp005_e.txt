NOTE ON POSSIBLE ACTION AT THE EIGHTH ANTARCTIC TREATY
CONSULTATIVE MEETING ON SCAR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING
TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

Submitted by United Kingdom at Second Preparatory Meeting
in Oslo, 25 February 1975, as PP 2/5.

(Paper submitted by United Kingdom)

1.       We suggest that governments need not take any
action about the Specially Protected Areas which SCAR
proposes should be retained with their existing boundaries.

2.       We also suggest that, in principle, we accept the
SCAR proposals to redesignate some of the existing Specially
Protected Areas as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

3.       However, before we can redesignate Cape Crozier,
Byers Peninsula, Lynch Island and Coppermine Peninsula as
Sites of Special Scientific Interest, we shall need approved
Management Plans for each of them. These plans can perhaps
best be prepared by the governments which originally proposed
the areas (in this case, for example, the UK could undertake
Lynch Island). If agreed at the Consultative Meeting, after
each Management Plan has been approved by SCAR and submitted
to governments through National Committees, these redesignations
will require cancellation of the relevant Recommendations, e.g.

IV-6              Cape Crozier
IV-10            Byers Peninsula
IV-12 & V-5    Fildes Peninsula
IV-14            Lynch Island
. 2.

We could safely cancel IV-12 and V-5 in June without delay,
but we do not want to cancel the others until they can at the
same time be redesignated as Sites of Special Scientific
Interest. None of the necessary completed Management Plans
are expected to be ready by June and SCAR may well change
its mind after further study (see paragraph 1 of their review).

4.      Paragraph 3 of the SCAR response to Recommendation
VII-2 indicates that they think there is an important gap in
the arrangements. The relevant references are Article VI,
paragraph 3, and Article VIII of the Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, and Recommendation
VI-8 (none of which, incidentally, are yet in force). SCAR
thinks that the present wording excludes all but biologists
intending to collect specimens. As the United Kingdom understands
the position, anyone can at present enter a Specially Protected
Area. They only need a permit if they want to take a few
specified actions within a Specially Protected Area. As a
result of experience since 1964, what we now really want to
achieve is that no-one shall be allowed to enter a Specially
Protected Area except with a permit which shall specify what
they may do and why. For this purpose we probably need a new
Recommendation to replace VI-8, which was a compromise.

5.      In any event, the United Kingdom representatives
think we should not attempt to alter Recommendation VI-8 until
SCAR has finished their review.

6.      For these reasons, we suggest that the only action
that can usefully be taken in June on this item is to cancel
Recommendations IV-12 and V-5. This could perhaps most easily
be done by adding an appropriate paragraph to the Report of
the Consultative Meeting. If this idea finds favour, the United
Kingdom representatives are ready to provide a draft paragraph
for discussion.
