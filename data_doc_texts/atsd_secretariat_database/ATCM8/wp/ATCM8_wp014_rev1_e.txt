COOPERATION IN TRANSPORT

(Draft Recommendation submitted by New Zealand, South Africa,
United Kingdom and United States)

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendation VII-8;

Recognising that access to Antarctica by long range
aircraft combined with intracontinental feeder routes
by smaller aircraft would facilitate new levels of
cooperation and flexibility in research;

Noting the interest taken by SCAR in the potential benefits
to be derived from a cooperative air transport system;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They request their offices administering their
Antarctic expeditions to review their scientific
programmes in order to identify the ways in which
such a cooperative air transport system might
benefit them and to inform SCAR through their
representatives on the SCAR Working Group on Logistics;

2. Through their National Antarctic Committees, they
request SCAR to review the available transport
resources and the potential requirements with
respect to a cooperative air transport system and
to bring their conclusions to the attention of the
Consultative Parties.
