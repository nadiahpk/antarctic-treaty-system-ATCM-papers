MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR BYERS PENINSULA

Submitted by Chile.

(Replacing ANT/25, submitted by Chile in English on 12 June 1975.)

1. Description of the Site.

The proposed area comprises the major part of the southwest
coast of Byers Peninsula. It has a maximum width of 1 km, and
its total extent is estimated at about 20 km2. The site is
normally accessible by boat, or at times by helicopter. A map of
the area is attached to ANT/20/Add.1.

2. Reasons for establishment.

These are given in ANT/20/Add.1 under item 10.

3. Outline of proposed research.

The objectives of the proposed research are to obtain
information on the links between former flora and fauna and the
determination of sediment types. That would contribute to a better
knowledge of Jurassic and Cretaceous flora and fauna and their
possible links with those of southern continents adjacent to
Antarctica. Research will therefore concentrate on Paleontology
and Sedimentology.

4. Period of designation of Site.

An initial period of five years is proposed subject to
renewal in accordance with SCAR recommendations in ANT/2.
5. Activities permitted on the Site.

(a) Access.

Access shall be from the south-west by helicopter or 
boat. Transit in the vicinity of the fossil zone shall be 
on foot.

(b) Scientific activities permitted.

Geological and biological observations will be permitted.
For other projects requiring semipermanent facilities a 
permit will be needed. Proposals for research will be 
reviewed by the Chilean SCAR Committee.

(c) Restrictions on access.

Scientists shall remain on the site during the period 
indicated in their permits, in accordance with the objectives 
of their research programmes.

(d) Scientific sampling.

Sampling of rocks, ice or biological specimens shall be 
subject to supervision by the Chilean SCAR Committee.
