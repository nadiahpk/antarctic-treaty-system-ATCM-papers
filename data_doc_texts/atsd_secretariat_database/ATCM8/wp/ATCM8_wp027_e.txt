SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
(Proposal submitted by New Zealand)

 SITE 1

Cape Royds, Ross Island

Latitude 77° 33' South, Longitude 166° 09' East.

General Description

This area supports the most southerly Adelie penguin
rookery known and the survival of the colony is marginal.
The population declined rapidly from 1956 following inter-
ference by man until 1963 when United States and New Zealand
authorities agreed to implementing tight controls on man's
activities and later developed a management plan for the area.
A study of the increasing penguin population has been under-
taken over the past six years and it is considered important
to continue this study under controlled conditions, at least
until the penguin population has recovered to its estimated
normal pre-1956 (pre-man) level (Thomson 1974).

Area to be designated "Site of Special Scientific Interest"

All that area of Cape Royds west of a line drawn from
the south coast of the Cape through Flagstaff Hill to the south
eastern tip of Pony Lake, and the west shoreline of this lake;
and south of a line drawn from the western extremity of Pony
Lake 280°T to the coast.

Management Plan

Limitations on Access and Activities

Entry is only restricted during the period of penguin
occupation, that is mid-October - March approximately. During
the non occupied period the activities prohibited are:-

1.      Landscaping and removing surface material.
2.      Construction of huts or buildings.
3.      The depositing of any pieces of equipment or
material that would in any way hinder re-
occupation of nests by penguins.

During the occupied period only personnel directly
involved in the penguin population studies may enter the Site
and they should follow the marked tracks and not move
directly through the populated areas. Summer visitors to
Cape Royds, while not permitted within the Site, will however
be able to view and photograph penguins from the marked
boundaries of the Site. No scientific studies other than the
penguin population counts are permitted.

The attention of all scientists, support personnel
and visitors is drawn to the restrictions on flying and other
activities as specified under the Agreed Measures for the
Protection of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

Period of Designation as Site of Special
Scientific Interest

A period of 3 - 5 years under the present Management
Plans is envisaged.
