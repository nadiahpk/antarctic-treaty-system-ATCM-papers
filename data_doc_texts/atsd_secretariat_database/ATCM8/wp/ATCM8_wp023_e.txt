ANTARCTIC RESOURCES - EFFECTS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION

Draft Recommendation submitted by the U.S.S.R.

The Representatives,

Bearing in mind the aims and principles of the Antarctic
Treaty;

Reaffirming that it is in the interest of all mankind that
the Antarctic Treaty Area shall continue forever to be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene
or object of international discord;

Acknowledging that the Antarctic Treaty places a special
responsibility upon the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate
efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations,
to ensure that no-one engages in any activity in the Antarctic
Treaty Area contrary to the purposes or principles of the Treaty;

Bearing in mind that exploration (and exploitation) of
minerals constitutes a threat to the environment and is liable
to disrupt the ecosystem in the Antarctic Treaty Area;

Recalling the special natural conditions in the Antarctic
Treaty Area, the unique character of its environment and the
major importance of the Area with respect to its history, scenery
and general scientific interest;

Noting that conservation and investigation of the unique
environment in the Antarctic Treaty Area is of great importance
to all mankind and that this environment is still inadequately
studied and remains a field for investigation;

Reaffirming that the Consultative Parties bear a particular 
responsibility for environmental protection in the Antarctic 
Treaty Area;

Recognising that the geological formation of Antarctica, and 
particularly its continental shelf, has not been sufficiently 
investigated and 

Reaffirming that scientific investigations in the Antarctic 
Treaty Area may be jeopardised by accidental or wilful 
interference;

Recognising that at the present time available scientific 
information is insufficient to make it possible to foresee 
all the potential harmful effects on the environment which may 
result form mineral exploration and exploitation;

Recalling that Recommendations VI - 7, VI - 11, VII - 1, 
VII - 2, VII - 3, VII - 4 and VII - 5 all deal essentially with 
the need to strengthen protection of the environment in the 
Antarctic Treaty Area;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They invite SCAR, through their National Committees, to draw 
up an international 7 - 10 year programme for joint geological 
and geophysical investigation of Antarctica, and submit it to the 
Ninth Consultative Meeting.

2. They invite SCAR, through their National Committess, to draw 
up an international programme for investigation of the possible 
impact of mineral exploration and exploitation in the Treaty Area 
on the environment of the said Area.

3. They abstain from conduct of mineral exploration and 
exploitation in the Antarctic Treaty Area and, if necessary, return
to this matter after the aforesaid investigations have been
completed.
