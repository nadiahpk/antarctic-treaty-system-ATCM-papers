RECOMMENDATION VIII

Sites of Special Scientific Interest: Haswell Island.

Draft submitted by the USSR.

The Representatives,

Considering that Haswell Island is a unique nesting-place for
almost all species of birds in the Eastern Antarctic (five
species of stormy petrel, one species of a seagull-type bird,
and one species of penguin), that the section of the sea contiguous
to the island is particularly rich in sea-bed and pelagic flora
and fauna, and that for this reason Haswell Island must be brought
under special protection;

Recommend to their Governments that the following text should
be inserted in the Annex to the Agreed Measures for the Conservation
of Antarctic fauna and flora:

Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 8:

Haswell Island and the contiguous shore ice.

Lat. 66° 31' S., Long 93° 00' E.

Description: The site comprises Haswell Island, which
covers 1 square kilometre (the largest island in The Archipelago),
lying 2,5 kilometres form the Soviet Mirny Station, and the
contiguous shore ice covering approx. 2 square kilometres,
situated S. - S.E. of Haswell Island.
