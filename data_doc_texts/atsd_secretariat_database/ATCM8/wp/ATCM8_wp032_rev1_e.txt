AGENDA ITEM 15: ACTIVITIES OF COUNTRIES NOT PARTIES TO THE TREATY

ACTIVITIES OF STATES THAT ARE NOT CONTRACTING PARTIES

Draft Recommendation submitted by Argentina and the United Kingdom.

The Representatives,

Recalling the provisions and principles of the Antarctic Treaty;

Reaffirming that it is in the interest of all mankind that
Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for
peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of
international discord;

Recognizing that the Antarctic Treaty places a special
responsibility on the Contracting Parties to exert appropriate
efforts, consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, to
the end that no one engages in any activity in the Antarctic
Treaty area contrary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty;

Considering paragraph 15 to 17 of the Report of the Seventh
Consultative Meeting regarding activities in the Treaty area by
States that are not Contracting Parties;

Considering further that it is desirable for States which
are Parties to the Treaty to approve existing and future
recommendations which form an integral part of the Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments:

1. That they reaffirm the principles set forth in paragraphs 15
to 17 of the Report of the Seventh Consultative Meeting in
respect of activities by States that are not Contracting Parties
to the Antarctic Treaty.

2. That they urge the States concerned that have or 
will become Parties to the Antarctic Treaty to approve the 
Recommendations adopted at Consultative Meetings in pursuance 
of the Treaty and subsequently approved by the Governments of 
all the Contracting Parties whose representatives are entitled 
to participate in those Meetings.
