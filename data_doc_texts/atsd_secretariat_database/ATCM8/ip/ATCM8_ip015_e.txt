OPENING STATEMENT BY THE NORWEGIAN HEAD OF DELEGATION

Delegates,

On behalf of my Delegation I would like to extend to
you a warm welcome to Oslo.  I hope you will have both a
fruitful and pleasant stay here.  I would also like to thank
all of you who have just spoken, for your kind words about
Norway.

Norway is attaching great importance to the Antarctic
Treaty and to the cooperation under the Treaty.  We believe
that the results produced by this cooperation will have a
decisive influence upon the future of the Antarctic.

We are therefore both pleased and honoured to be host
for this Eight Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

We have a long agenda before us and a number of
difficult problems to deal with, more difficult, perhaps, than
we have been dealing with in the past.  But I hope that we
also this time will be able to reach agreements which will
prove beneficial to further development of the Antarctic.

Thank you
