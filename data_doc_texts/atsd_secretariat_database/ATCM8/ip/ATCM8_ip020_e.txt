OPENING STATEMENT BY HIS EXCELLENCY AMBASSADOR E. HAMBRO,              
CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE, 9 JUNE 1975              


The Foreign Minister has declared the Session for              
opened and he has expressed the wishes of the Host Government.              

Your chairman has little to add to that statement at              
the present moment.              

Still, I feel sure that you will allow me to take two              
minutes of your time in order to express a fervent desire for              
the success of our common endeavour.              

Some of you have worked with Antarctic problems for many              
years and some of us are comparative new comers.  Still, we all              
have in common the feeling that our Treaty has functioned              
well.  Each passing year has strengthened our collaboration              
and increased our feeling that the task is worth while.  The              
Treaty is even more significant now than it was when it was              
drafted.  New problems face us and they must be solved in a              
spirit of common understanding without preconceived ideas.  Our              
aims will be more important in the future and also more              
difficult to achieve.  Each year will bring a crucial test to              
our will to work together.              

Constructive statesmanship must be imbued by a sense              
of reality.  The first few years will show whether the Treaty              
shall be a footnote to history or a pattern for constructive              
international collaboration of real importance for the future.
