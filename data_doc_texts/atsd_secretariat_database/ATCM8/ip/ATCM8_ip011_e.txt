OPENING STATEMENT                
BY THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE                

MR. CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED REPRESENTATIVES AND                
DELEGATES:                

MAY I OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS, AND THOSE OF MY                
COLLEAGUES TO YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, ON YOUR ELECTION AS THE                
DIRECTOR OF OUR DELIBERATIONS DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.                
RARELY, IF EVER, HAS A CHAIRMAN BROUGHT SO MUCH EXPERIENCE                
IN THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONAL DEBATE TO THE ANTARCTIC                
TREATY FORUM. WE ARE FORTUNATE, INDEED, THAT IT HAS COME                
TO PASS AS WE EMBARK ON THE COURSE WE HAVE SET FOR OUR-                
SELVES AT THIS EIGHTH CONSULTATIVE MEETING. YOUR WISDOM,                
WIT AND TACT WILL SURELY KEEP US ATTENTIVE TO OUR IMPOR-                
TANT DUTIES.                

MAY I ALSO EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE OF MY GOVERNMENT AND                
DELEGATION FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S GENEROSITY IN ACTING AS HOST                
TO THIS MEETING, AND FOR THESE FINE, MODERN ACCOMODATIONS                
NORWAY HAS PLACED AT OUR DISPOSAL.  IN ADDITION, IT GIVES                
US SPECIAL PLEASURE TO MEET IN THE COUNTRY WHOSE NAME IS                
SO SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION AND,                
OF COURSE, THE FIRST ON-SITE OBSERVATION OF THE GEOGRAPHIC
-2-

South Pole.

We have gathered for this meeting to discuss matters
of common interest with regard to the Antarctic Continent.
Global events since the last Consultative Meeting in 1972
have sharpened the focus on some of the issues we will
be dealing with. Other matters before us, perhaps more
routine in nature for this assembly, are nonetheless
important for the continued vitality of the Treaty and
the cooperation which has evolved from it. My government
is firmly dedicated to support for the Treaty and the
enhancement of that cooperation. It is in this spirit
that we address ourselves to the matters at hand in this
meeting.

The cooperation which has flourished under the Treaty
has, for the most part, been excellent. It can, however,
be improved. Full and faithful observation of all of the
provisions of the Treaty and recommendations adopted by
governments should, of course, be the foundation for
cooperation among us on all matters pertaining to Antarctica.
I would be less than candid if I did not express our
concern about compliance with the Treaty provisions for
reporting on Antarctic activities. Failure to meet agreed
deadlines for reports cannot serve to maintain its fabric.
We welcome the agenda item on this subject, which gives
us all the opportunity to discuss and hopefully rectify

THIS SHORTCOMING,

A QUESTION OF CONTINUING INTEREST TO THE TWELVE NATIONS 
REPRESENTED HERE, AND WITH RAMIFICATIONS FAR BEYOND THE 
TREATY AREA, IS THE PROTECTION OF THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT.
THE SUCCESS OF PRESENT AND FUTURE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS 
DEPENDENT ON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE ANTARCTIC ECOSYSTEM.
BREAKDOWN OR DEGRADATION OF THAT SYSTEM COULD ALSO HAVE 
SERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE WORLD'S CLIMATE, OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE.
I NOTE WITH PLEASURE THAT NO LESS THAN SIX AGENDA ITEMS 
ARE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS.

LOGISTICS ARE AT THE HEART OF ANY SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS 
IN ANTARCTICA. ALL OF US WHO HAVE MOUNTED EXPEDITIONS 
OR CONDUCTED SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS ON THE CONTINENT HAVE 
DEALT WITH THIS SOMETIMES VEXING PROBLEM IN OUR OWN WAY,
USUALLY ALONE OR IN COOPERATION WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER 
NATIONS WHEN OUR PATHS LED IN THE SAME DIRECTION. WIDER 
COOPERATION COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL. THEREFORE, WE ARE 
PLEASED TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION UNDER THE ITEM ON COOPERATION 
IN TRANSPORT, AND TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION OF AN INTER-
NATIONAL AIRBUS SYSTEM FOR THE CONTINENT, A SYSTEM WHICH 
WOULD ASSIST US ALL IN MAKING REAL PROGRESS TOWARD GREATER 
COOPERATION IN LOGISTIC SUPPORT FOR OUR PROGRAMS.

WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSION OF ADMINISTRATIVE 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONSULTATIVE MECHANISM, WITH EACH 
NEW CONSULTATIVE MEETING, THE NEED FOR A RATIONAL SYSTEM
-4-

TO HANDLE DOCUMENTS, AND TO         DEAL WITH THE GROWING 
NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ADMIN-
ISTRATIVE MATTERS, BECOMES INCREASINGLY ACUTE. WHILE WE 
HAVE NO SPECIFIC PALLIATIVE TO OFFER, WE HOPE THE DISCUSSIONS 
WILL PRODUCE CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS FOR ALL TO CONSIDER.

DURING THIS MEETING WE WILL BE SEIZED WITH A MATTER 
OF UNUSUAL COMPLEXITY - THE QUESTION OF ANTARCTIC MINERAL 
RESOURCES.  IN MANY RESPECTS WE ARE DEALING WITH UNKNOWNS -
RESOURCES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST IN COMMERCIALLY ATTRAC-
TIVE QUANTITIES; TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR POSSIBLE RECOVERY 
WHICH IS STILL NON-EXISTENT THOUGH POSSIBLY ON THE HORIZON, 
AND NO CRYSTAL BALL WHICH WILL TELL US WHAT THE WORLD 
MARKET PICTURE FOR SUCH RESOURCES, IF THEY EXIST IN 
COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE QUANTITIES, MIGHT BE IN 5, 10, OR 
PERHAPS MORE YEARS HENCE.  THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, IS BEFORE 
US AND WILL NOT DISAPPEAR OF ITS OWN ACCORD.  WE ARE 
PREPARED TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION IN A SPIRIT OF CANDOR 
AND CCOPERATION, CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN, IN TIME, FIND A 
SOLUTION TO THE CONUNDRUM WHICH WILL BE SATISFACTORY TO ALL.

IN THIS CONNECTION, LET ME SHARE WITH YOU OUR 
PRELIMINARY VIEWS:

  -- MINERAL RESOURCE ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA SHOULD 
     NOT BECOME THE OBJECT OF SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL DISCORD.

  -- EXPLORATION FOR AND EXPLOITATION OF ANTARCTIC
-5-

MINERAL RESOURCES SHOULD NOT DISRUPT THE CONTINUED
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY,

-- THE SENSITIVE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT MUST BE PROTECTED
FROM HARM CAUSED BY ANY MINERAL RESOURCE ACTIVITIES.

FINALLY, LET ME ASSOCIATE MYSELF AND MY DELEGATION
WITH THE FELICITATIONS ALREADY EXPRESSED TO THE TWO NEW
MEMBERS OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY - THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC AND BRAZIL.

THANK YOU,
