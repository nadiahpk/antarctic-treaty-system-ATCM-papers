Cable for Ambassador Hambro from Executive Director Strong,
UNEP, Nairobi:

At recent meeting of UNEP Governing Council
consideration was given to inclusion in UNEP programme
of possible activities in respect of Antarctic environment
in cooperation with Treaty countries. Governing Council
decided to exclude such activities in the programme for the
coming year as formally adopted by Governing Council, but
in informal discussions on this matter, Treaty countries
represented at Governing Council meeting, indicated general
acceptance of UNEP interest in this question and willingness
to have it participate in scientific and technical activities
related to Antarctic environment in a manner appropriate with
its general mandate and programme. Accordingly would like to
plan for and prepare such activities as part of regular
planning of programme. As this, of course, can best be done
by cooperating with your committee, I would be grateful if
you could advise us as to means by which you consider UNEP
might most usefully cooperate, assist and be informed of
your activities in this respect.
