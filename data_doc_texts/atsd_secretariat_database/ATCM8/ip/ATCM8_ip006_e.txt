                        its programme, SCAR will take care to acknowledge the autonomy of other

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ANTARCTIC TREATY GOVERNMENTS

There is no direct formal link between the Antarctic Treaty governments
and SCAR; the link is from SCAR through its national committees. SCAR
did propose that a more formal and direct route be established for conveying
SCAR resolutions (SCAR executive meeting. July 1967), but this suggestion
was not adopted because the representatives of the consultative governments
at the Fifth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, 1968, believed it might
inhibit the freedom of action of SCAR.

SCAR is regarded by the Antarctic Treaty governments as a source of
scientific advice, and it aims to respond promptly to their requests. Initially,
SCAR either conveys such requests to its appropriate working group for
preliminary consideration or the executive may establish a group of specialists
to formulate recommendations. These recommendations may then be
considered by the SCAR executive. submitted for approval to national
committees, and conveyed to the treaty governments. It is thus possible for
advice to be formulated and conveyed within 18 months. in time for con-
sideration at the Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting following the one at
which the request was formulated, regardless of whether SCAR holds a
general meeting in that time or not. However, it is desirable that such
requests and recommendations be considered by a full SCAR meeting and,
unless some urgency is indicated, that would be normal practice.
