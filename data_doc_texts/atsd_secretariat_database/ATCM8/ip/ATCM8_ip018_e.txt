SPEECH BY MR. B. MILLS, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REPUBLIC
OF SOUTH AFRICA

Mr. Chairman

The South African delegation would like to congratulate
you with your election as Chairman of this meeting. My
delegation is confident that under your wise and experienced
guidance this meeting will be able to contribute to the
achievement of the principles and objectives of the Treaty.

I also wish to thank the Norwegian Government for the
welcome we have received in the beautiful country of Roald
Amundsen, the first explorer to reach the geographical south
pole.

The developments since the last Consultative Meeting
emphasised the need for continued co-operation and goodwill
and also call for a desire to overcome obstacles which appear
to be very difficult.

Eyes from different directions are staring at Antarctica
with the belief that the need for urgent requirements can be
met from that source.  The last two years, especially the so
called "energy crisis", showed us that world events could
easily overtake our rather slow arrangements to meet Antarctic
problems.  This inhospitable part of the world has also become
a challenge to tourists. These factors which may at present
be considered as a nuisance are quite natural and must be
faced by the Treaty Members in the same spirit as all other
problems which cropped up since 1959.

It is our contention that we now, more than ever before,
have a responsibility to find solutions to those problems which
if not properly controlled, will result in the destruction of
that unspoiled land.

In the past the Treaty Countries agreed on certain
measures which were in practice mainly applicable to members
of the Treaty only.  The application of those measures were
fairly simple. With the wider interest in Antarctica it has
now become much more complicated and we are now called upon
to be very realistic in our considerations and to lay the
foundation for future development of that part of the world
without destroying the objectives and principles of the
Treaty.

Thank you Mr. Chairman
