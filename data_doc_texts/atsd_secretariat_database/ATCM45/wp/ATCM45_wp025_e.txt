Sixth report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and
Outreach
Working Paper submitted by Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile,
COMNAP, Czech Republic, Finland, IAATO, India, Italy, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, SCAR, South Africa,
Spain, UK and USA
Summary
At ATCM XLIV (2022) in Berlin, Parties decided to continue the
work of the Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) on Education and
Outreach, following a number of terms of reference related to
education and outreach. This paper aims to provide a summary on
the discussions within the ICG and recommends considerations by
the ATCM of the outcomes of the intersessional work. Overall, there
were three topics discussed (education and outreach activities,
exchange information on equity, diversity and inclusion, and on
review ICG work and future developments), with 26 posts (from
October 2022 up to 28 March 2023) from 20 Parties, Observers and
Experts comprising 619 views within the forum.
Background
The ICG on Education and Outreach was established during ATCM
XXXVIII (2015) in Sofia, Bulgaria, following a very successful
workshop in which ninety-seven participants from thirty-seven
Parties, Observers and Experts took part. During ATCM XXXIX
(2016) in Santiago, Chile, Bulgaria introduced WP 24 First Report
on the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach,
jointly prepared with Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, and the
United Kingdom. The ATCM recognised the contribution of Parties
and the usefulness of the ICG’s work. Parties were advised to
continue to use and promote the forum on Education and Outreach
to share information on education and outreach activities and
events with each other. Information about education and outreach
activities from an Antarctic Treaty perspective remains within the
Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan of the ATCM as well as within the
CEP Work Plan.
As stated in the Final Report of ATCM XLIV (2022) in Berlin,
Germany, paragraphs 173–174, the Meeting agreed its support for
continued use of the ATCM forum on education and outreach issues
and approved continuing the ICG on Education and Outreach for
another intersessional period, with the following terms of reference:
• Fostering collaboration at both the national and international
level, on education and outreach;
• Identifying key international activities/events related to education
and outreach for possible engagement by the Antarctic Treaty
Parties;
• Sharing results of education and outreach initiatives that
demonstrate the work of Antarctic Treaty Parties in managing the
Antarctic Treaty area;
• Emphasizing ongoing environmental protection initiatives that
have been informed by scientific observations and results, in order
to reinforce the importance of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol
on Environmental Protection;
• Promoting related education and outreach activities by Experts
and Observers, and encouraging cooperation with these groups;
• Sharing best practices and encouraging, enhancing and promoting
diversity and inclusion across the global Antarctic community,
including among scientists, logisticians, policymakers and all others
engaged in Antarctic matters, in order to lower any barriers to the
engagement of all the talents needed to tackle the challenges of the
future of Antarctica;
• Encouraging Parties to provide the Secretariat with link(s) to their
web page(s) with educational and outreach resources (the
Secretariat will include these links in its “Educational Resources”
section of the Secretariat webpage); and
• Inviting Parties, Observers and Experts to review, during the
intersessional period at the ATCM Education and Outreach Forum,
the work carried out by the ICG and discuss its future development.
Method of Operation
The ICG operates using the online ATCM Discussion Forum, under
the topic ‘ICG on Education and Outreach’. The discussion is open
to all Parties, Observers and Experts, of which, 20 Parties,
Observers and Experts (up to 28 of March 2023) have participated
in the forum. The ICG began work in October 2022.
Discussions
There were 26 posts with 563 views (up to 28 of March 2023).
There were three topics within the forum: 1- Education and
outreach activities carried out by Parties, Observers and Experts; 2–
Exchange request of information on examples on education of
equity, diversity, and inclusion from Antarctic Programs and 3-
Feedback request on the work carried out by the ICG and discuss its
future development. It can be noted that posts included relevant
links to obtain further information on their activities.
Topic 1: Education and outreach activities carried out by Parties,
Observers and Experts
A total of 16 Parties (Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech
Republic, Finland, India, Italy, Korea (ROK), Malaysia, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Spain, South Africa and USA), two Observers
(SCAR and COMNAP), and one Expert (IAATO) reported their
activities on education and outreach. Reports noted activities such
as lectures/lessons/seminars in schools/Universities/other public
areas, webinars to Antarctic stations/research ships while in the
Antarctic, science/film festivals, online competitions, polar science/
art camps/training courses, outreach information on biosecurity
protocols, outreach ceremonies, national science conferences/
symposiums, events celebrating national contributions to Antarctic
exploration, development of educational materials (including
translation of materials from English language into native language;
incorporation of Antarctic themes into national school curriculums),
citizen science activities, books (including the Polar Resource book
with Polar Educators International (PEI), Association of Polar Early
Career Scientists (APECS) and International Arctic Science
Committee (IASC)), exhibitions; TV/radio/newspaper interviews/
documentaries/video animations/programs linked to media; social
media (e.g. blogs, Youtube channels, Facebook pages, Instagram),
international activities (e.g. Polar WEEKS, in cooperation with the
APECS and PEI, Antarctica Day celebrations, International Antarctic
Ambassador Day, European Researchers´ Night activities, outreach
via research journals, international exhibitions). The large number
of institutions and participants involved in these activities is
noteworthy.
Topic 2: Exchange request of information on examples on education
of equity, diversity, and inclusion from Antarctic Programs
Two Parties (Portugal and Spain) and one Observer (SCAR)
contributed to this topic. Parties expressed their national
contributions on increasing the awareness on equity, diversity and
inclusion within their national programs as well as efforts to fight
discrimination, homophobia and transphobia. Activities included a
special session in the national training programme (focusing on its
basic concepts, public policies and prevention on these topics) and
addition of equity, diversity and inclusion as elements within
national program practises (e.g. inclusive logistical support for all
researchers, evaluation of equity/diversity/inclusion data of the
polar community, surveys to identify potential issues, mechanisms
to promote best practices in terms of codes of conduct. More
cooperation with other polar organizations on these topics are
planned in the near future. SCAR has an EDI Action Group (EDI AG)
which works on topics such as code of conduct, surveying diversity
across the community and SCAR´s capacity building activities (e.g.
celebrated Polar Pride Day, Women in Polar Science initiative) and
COMNAP has a representative on that EDI AG.
Topic 3: Feedback request on the work carried out by the ICG and
discuss its future development
Two Parties (Belgium and Portugal) and one Observer (SCAR)
contributed to this topic expressing their support for the
continuation of the ICG on Education and Outreach for exchange of
information with the ATCM and CEP, the need to promote a higher
level of cooperation between Parties, Observers and Experts on
education and outreach related to the Antarctic Treaty, evaluate
mechanisms to work together with various stakeholders in
obtaining the scientific facts/knowledge (SCAR Capacity Building,
Education and Training (CBET), in engaging the young generations
of scientists (with APECS) and in reviewing the most important
Antarctic topics for education and outreach, carry out national/
international education/outreach activities and identify future
topics that will need to be addressed educationally to connect with
Educators Worldwide (with the PEI)). Finally, given the first ATCM
Workshop on Education and Outreach was held eight years ago
(Bulgaria, 2015), there is support for a second Workshop on
Education and Outreach in order to reflect on the accomplishments
achieved, to identify gaps and needs, and to plan future actions.
Recommendations
The ICG recommends that the ATCM:
Recognise the usefulness of the Forum on Education and Outreach
and support the work of the ICG during one more intersessional
period;
Promote the usage of the Forum to provide information of Parties’
activities related to education and outreach and facilitate experts
within their delegations to access the Forum;
Supports Parties, Observers and Experts to engage in key
international activities/events related to education and outreach,
including those focused on equity, diversity and inclusion;
Encourages Parties to continue to promote not only Antarctica and
Antarctic research through their Education and Outreach activities,
but the Antarctic Treaty and the Environmental Protocol in
themselves;
Discuss the possibility to organise and plan for the second
Workshop on Education and Outreach.
