Urgent measures to be taken with respect to certain tourist and non-
governmental activities
Urgent measures to be taken with respect to certain tourist and non-
governmental activities
Summary
In order to address the urgency highlighted by previous formal and
informal ATCM discussions regarding Antarctic tourism, in
particular issues related to increasing visitor numbers and
diversification of activities, France and the Netherlands propose the
adoption of a Resolution calling on Governments to prevent the
development of certain tourism and non-governmental activities
that are found to be inconsistent with rules and principles of the
Antarctic Treaty System, pending the completion of the discussions
on a comprehensive instrument dedicated to tourism.
Introduction
France and the Netherlands co-chaired an informal workshop on a
strategic vision and policy program for Antarctic tourism, hosted by
France in Paris (8 to 10 March 2023). In this framework,
participants from 17 Consultative Parties, 2 Non-Consultative
Parties, 4 Experts and Observer organisations discussed Antarctic
tourism issues. Based on previous ATCM formal and informal
discussions, the debates highlighted that he ATCM should take
action to address Antarctic tourism related concerns, such as
growth, diversification, monitoring, compliance and governance.
The workshop also emphasized the need to act quickly to address
certain urgent issues, such as those related to specific tourism
activities. These urgent measures are the subject of this WP.
This WP acknowledges that the main outcome of the workshop is
the proposal to discuss at ATCM 45 the draft-Decision to start a
dedicated process on the development of a comprehensive and
consistent framework for tourism and other non-governmental
activities in Antarctica (see Working Paper 13 “Dedicated process
for the development of a comprehensive and consistent framework
for Antarctic tourism and other non-governmental activities”
submitted to ATCM XLV, hereafter referred to as the “WP013”).
However, the above-mentioned urgency on identified specific issues
also justifies a discussion on the adoption of immediate measures.
Acknowledging that developing a comprehensive and consistent
framework will take time, immediate action is necessary to prevent
the continued increase and diversification of tourism activities from
leading to a situation of hard-to-reverse non-compliance with the
ATS rules and principles. The proponents would like to emphasize
the complementary nature of the approaches presented in the
above-mentioned WP013 and the present WP. The latter does not
call into question the need expressed by WP013 to break with a
piecemeal approach with regards to tourism management. It falls
within a different time frame, and simply aims to address urgent
issues that cannot wait for the process proposed by the WP013 to be
completed.
‘No regret’ measures
Based on the discussions in the Paris Workshop, the proponents of
this WP propose to the ATCM to discourage the following activities
from being carried out in the Antarctic:
overnight camping in the top-20 most visited sites;
any off-ship activities in Antarctica from vessels carrying more than
500 passengers (additionally to the landing prohibition of Measure
15 (2009)), to ensure these activities are real ‘cruise only’ activities;
helicopter or any other motorized land vehicle use for tourism and
other non-governmental activities, except in case of emergencies
and for the purpose of enhancing human safety;
site visits that are not covered by ATCM or IAATO site-specific
guidelines and/or ATCM management plans and/or visits to sites
that have never been visited by tourists or other non-governmental
activities.
The proponents of this WP consider that these activities may
contravene Article 3 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
the Antarctic Treaty. Overnight stays, off-ship activities conducted
by large numbers of passengers during a long period of the day,
recreational use of motorized vehicles, visits to unexplored sites, or
access to new wildlife colonies on which little or no scientific data
are available, are found to be inconsistent with the respect of the
intrinsic value of Antarctica, including its wilderness and aesthetic
values and its value as an area for the conduct of scientific research.
In addition, these activities may pose safety issues that could pose
serious threats on the ability of operators to respond efficiently and
timely to incidents.
Proponents of this WP suggest that the implementation of these
activities be discouraged through a specific Resolution. It will have
the following benefits:
It will provide the Parties with an ATCM instrument to use to
prevent the development of activities that are not in line with the
principles, values and rules of the ATS, especially article 3 of the
EP, taking into account the fact that it is easier to act before these
activities develop too widely, while it is more difficult to go back
and stop activities that have already been deployed at a large scale;
It will contribute to meet the General Principles of Antarctic
Tourism adopted by Resolution 7 (2009);
It will allow for the harmonization of practices of all Parties, avoid
inconsistency in this regard, and thus provide a level playing field
for operators.
Proposals to the 45th ATCM in Helsinki
France and the Netherlands, propose to the 45th ATCM in Helsinki:
to discuss and adopt the proposed Resolution annexed to the
present WP
Resolution XX (2023)
[title]
The Representatives, Concerned about the continuing and
substantial increase in the numbers and diversity of tourism and
other non-governmental activities in Antarctica;
Acknowledging that the concerns associated with the growth,
diversification, monitoring, compliance and governance in relation
to Antarctic tourism and other non-governmental activities in
Antarctica require the ATCM to take urgent responsibility for
international governance action;
Recalling Resolutions 2 (2022), which adopted and updated lists of
sites subject to Site Guidelines for Visitors (“Site Guidelines”);
Recalling Measure 15 (2009) and the “General Principles of
Antarctic Tourism” adopted by Resolution 7 (2009);
Recommend that their Governments:
Require their operators organizing or conducting tourist or other
non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area, for which
advance notification is required in accordance with Article VII(5) of
the Antarctic Treaty:
to refrain from conducting overnight camping activities in Top
Twenty Most-Visited Sites between the 2016-17 and 2021-22
seasons, as listed in Appendix 1 to the present Resolution;
to refrain from conducting any off-ship activities in Antarctica from
vessels carrying more than 500 passengers;
to refrain from using helicopter or any other motorized land vehicle
for tourism and other non-governmental activities, except in case of
emergencies and for the purpose of enhancing human safety;
to refrain from landing in sites that are not covered by ATCM or
IAATO site-specific guidelines and/or ATCM management plans
and/or visits to sites that have never been visited by tourists or
other non-governmental activities.
