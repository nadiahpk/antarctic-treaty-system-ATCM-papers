Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected
Area (ASPA) No. 170 Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic
Peninsula
Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected
Area (ASPA) No. 170, Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic
Peninsula
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management
Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) No. 170 Marion
Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula, and has determined
that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom
recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised
Management Plan.
Background
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management
Plan for ASPA No. 170, Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic
Peninsula, in accordance with Annex V to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the ‘Revised
Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic
Specially Protected Areas’ appended to Resolution 2 (2011).
ASPA No. 170, Marion Nunataks (69o45’S, 75o15’W) is located in
the northwest corner of Charcot Island, to the west of Alexander
Island, Antarctic Peninsula. The Area was designated as ASPA No.
170 under Measure 4 (2008), following a proposal by the United
Kingdom, primarily to protect environmental values, and, in
particular, the terrestrial flora and fauna within the Area. The
terrestrial fauna is unique for the maritime Antarctic in that it
appears to contain neither predatory arthropods nor Collembola
(springtails), which are otherwise ubiquitous and important
members of the terrestrial fauna of the zone.
A revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 170 is provided at
Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Management
Plan. Minor amendments are summarised as follows:
The Supporting Documentation has been updated.
The text has been updated to record the discovery of a new species
of tardigrade, Hebesuncus mollispinus, identified from samples
taken from the Area.
The following text has been added under section 7(ii) Access to and
movement within or over the Area: ‘Overflight of bird colonies
within the Area by Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) shall
not be permitted unless for compelling scientific or operational
purposes, and in accordance with a permit issued by an appropriate
national authority. Furthermore, operation of RPAS within or over
the Area shall be in accordance with the ‘Environmental guidelines
for operation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) in
Antarctica’ (Resolution 4 (2018)) (available at: https://
documents.ats.aq/recatt/att645_e.pdf).’
A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout,
including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA
Management Plans and with the ‘Revised Guide to the Preparation
of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’.
Recommendation
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the
attached revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 170, Marion
Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula (Attachment A).
