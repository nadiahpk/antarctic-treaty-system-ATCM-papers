Background
Over the past decades, we have witnessed a significant increase in
the participation of women in all their diversity in the Antarctic
science and research. The share of women in Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meetings (ATCM) and Committee for Environmental
Protection meetings is also increasing, and more and more women
are leading their national delegations. In several occasions, Parties
have emphasized the importance of equality and inclusiveness in
the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty and many countries
have announced their commitment to promoting inclusivity and
diversity in their national Antarctic programs.
In addition, many international organizations have adopted
guidelines for gender-neutral language in their reporting, written,
and spoken communication. This is an encouraging development
and deserves to be recognized and enhanced. It is not just about
using the language correctly; gender-neutral language powerfully
reflects and influences attitudes, behavior and perceptions.
Gender-neutral language is a generic term covering the use of non-
sexist language, inclusive language or gender-fair language. The
purpose of gender-neutral language is to avoid word choices that
connect the word or a given concept only to one gender or that may
be interpreted as biased, discriminatory or demeaning by implying
that one sex or social gender is the norm. Using gender-fair and
inclusive language also helps reduce gender stereotyping, promotes
social change and contributes to achieving gender equality.
Gender equality is a universal goal that should be strived for in all
activities. It is often a matter of us systematically taking into
account the importance of gender equality in our own activities, no
matter how insignificant the matter may seem. The purpose of this
Working Paper in to draw the attention of Parties, Observers and
Experts to a certain dimension of the matter, in other words to the
use of language in documentation and communication related to
Antarctica.
