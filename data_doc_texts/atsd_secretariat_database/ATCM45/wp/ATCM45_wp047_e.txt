Subsidiary Group on Management Plans
Report of activities during the intersessional period 2022-2023
Working Paper submitted by India on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
The Subsidiary Group on Management Plan (SGMP) reviewed two
draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plans
referred by the Committee for intersessional review, during the
2022-23 intersessional period, in accordance with its Terms of
Reference 1 to 3. The SGMP recommends that the Committee
adopts the attached revised management plans (1) merger of
 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas No. 152 Western Bransfield
Strait and No. 153 Eastern Dallmann Bay, and (2) a new
Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of
the Western Sør Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East
Antarctic
Also, under its Terms of Reference (ToR) 4 and 6, the the SGMP
initiated a pre-meeting review of submitted reviewed and revised
management plans, starting immediately after working paper
deadline and reporting separately to CEP .
During CEP XXIV meeting, it is considered to include the task of
SGCCR within the purview of SGMP mandate under ToR 4&6 which
is reflected in paragraph 168, CEP XXIV Final report. SGMP,
initiated discussion under Terms of Reference 6, review and revise
where necessary existing management tools according to provisions
of Climate Change Work Response (CCRWP) action 2(e).
Tasks agreed by CEP XXIV for the work of the SGMP during the
intersessional period
For the intersessional period 2022-23 the SGMP had been
commissioned to work under the Terms of Reference (ToR) agreed
by CEP XIV (Appendix A) and in relation to the tasks incorporated
in the Work Plan of the Group, which is presented below, as
reflected in paragraph 168, CEP XXIV Final Report:
Terms of Reference
Suggested tasks
ToRs 1 to 3
Review draft management plans referred by CEP for intersessional
review and provide advice to proponents (including the three
pending plans from the previous intersessional period)
Submit Working Paper to CEP XXV on SGMP ToR 1 to 3
ToRs 4 to 6
Work with relevant Parties to ensure progress on the review of
management plans overdue for five-year review

necessary existing management tools for protection and subsequent
management of environments and habitats at risk from climate
change," consider if and how they effectively take climate change
issues into consideration and submit progress report to CEP XXV
The SGMP was convened by the CEP Vice-Chair from India. SGMP
members (CEP Members and Observers) participated in the
intersessional work, noting that the draft management plans for
merger of ASPA 152 and 153 as well as new proposed ASPA, in
parts of the Western Sør Rondane Mountains, was available for
comment from any CEP member during the SGMP process.
Discussions took place using the CEP Discussion Forum, may be
accessed for further information.
Task under Terms of Reference 1 to 3
Revision and merger of the Management Plans for Antarctic
Specially Protected Areas No. 152 Western Bransfield Strait and No.
153 Eastern Dallmann Bay
At CEP XXIV (2022), Unites States submitted WP 6 Revision and
merger of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected
Areas No. 152 Western Bransfield Strait and No. 153 Eastern
Dallmann Bay. Concerning ASPA 152 and ASPA 153 (WP 6), the
United States reported that the comprehensive review of these sites
had identified that there would be considerable benefit to merging
the two ASPAs into a single plan covering both areas. The United
States noted that the merger would maintain the same level of
protection as before while simplifying the Plan and eliminating
needless duplication associated with the common purposes, aims,
objectives, and management policies shared by ASPA 152 and ASPA
153. The United States considered that the revisions were major
and thus, recommended intersessional review by the SGMP and that
the Management Plan would be submitted to CCAMLR for approval
in accordance with Decision 9 (2005). Noting the major changes,
including the proposed merger of two sites, the Committee agreed
with the proponents’ recommendation to refer the draft revised
management plan to the SGMP for review in the intersessional
period (CEP XXIV Final report, para. 102). The SGMP’s review of
the management plan was coordinated by the SGMP member from
Argentina (Martín Andrés Díaz).
In October 2022, the SGMP convener issued an invitation to all CEP
contact points to submit comments on the draft management plan.
In November 2022 the SGMP provided its initial advice to the
proponents, stating that the draft Management Plan provided by the
United States is well written and, with some minor modification as
suggested, is likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and
objectives. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion
Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponents:
should include a principal reason or direct statement of the purpose
of the designation;
provide clarity that the Management Plan explicitly states that
commercial fishing is prohibited within the area, and it would be
useful to consider and, if appropriate, add some specific measures
for underwater;
should modify their boundaries to simplify the management of both
ASPAs and thus be more effective in meeting the objectives;
to add information about the important features of the site and the
scientific research and other activities taking place there as well as
to include in the introduction in summary form the activities that
take place in or near the area (e.g., research, boating, fishing,
tourism),
may consider necessity to include areas with important or unusual
assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native
birds or mammals;
to include the impacts and threats of climate change on the values ​
to be protected were included in the ASPA; and
to consider whether the details of maps should be presented in
color, incase photocopies are used.
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications,
the plan was likely to be effective in achieving the stated objectives
for management of the Area.
In January 2023, United States provided an updated draft
management plan as well as three maps and a separate document
explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP reviewed
the updated draft, further provided comments in first week of
February 2023.
In second week of March 2023, SGMP submitted checklist
endorsing coordinator’s comments concurrent to the response
received from the proponent, however no further comments
received from the members.
The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was
well written, of high quality, and proponents have closely
considered the SGMP's advice and have addressed the large
majority of the SGMP's suggestions. Therefore, the revised draft
management plan is improved and likely to be effective in
achieving the management objectives for the Area. The resulting
revised draft management plan and updated maps are presented in
Attachment A to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a
coversheet prepared by United States are presented at Appendix B.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the “Revision and
merger of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected
Areas No. 152 Western Bransfield Strait and No. 153 Eastern
Dallmann Bay” (Attachment A).
Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of the
Western Sør Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East
Antarctic
At CEP XXIV (2022), Belgium submitted WP 15 Proposal for a new
Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of the Western Sør
Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctic. Belgium
explained that the primary reason for designating several sites of
the Western Sør Rondane Mountains as an ASPA was to protect the
Area's unique terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems. It also noted
that this Area was the subject of scientific research on the
biodiversity and impact of climate change. Highlighting the sites as
representative of the natural terrestrial biological communities
typical for Antarctic mountainous regions, Belgium further noted
that the ASPA would increase the representation of mountainous
habitats in the Antarctic protected area system and enhance the
representation of ASPAs in the Antarctic Conservation
Biogeographic Region (ACBR) 6. The site also contained important
scientific,
wilderness, and aesthetic values. Belgium added that the proposed
management plan was built on the prior assessment presented in
CEP XX - WP 42 and referred to CEP XXI - IP 42.
Belgium recommended that the Committee forward the proposal to
the SGMP for review in the intersessional period. The Committee
reaffirmed that it recognised that the outstanding values of the Sør
Rondane Mountains site warranted protection. The Committee
agreed to advise the ATCM that it had decided to forward the draft
management plan for a new protected area to the SGMP for review
(CEP XXIV Final report, para. 109). The SGMP’s review of the
management plan was coordinated by the SGMP member from
Norway (Astrid Høgestø).
In October 2022, the SGMP convener issued an invitation to all CEP
contact points to submit comments on the draft management plan.
In December 2022 the SGMP provided its initial advice to the
proponents, providing sufficient time to the proponent to consider
in updating the Management Plan. In turn proponent submitted
revised document including response to the advice of SGMP as well
as commitment to improve the maps according to the SGMP advice.
The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In
particular, the group suggested that the proponents:
should improve the maps, and that the significance of the unique
terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem could be expanded on to
cover the flora and fauna at these sites;
should explain the actual or potential risks of values from human
activities and other pressures such as climate change;
should include some further information on the different species
that are present in the different nunataks;
should add more description of why the aesthetic values are
considered outstanding. Specific questions to consider were if there
have been artistic photographs or paintings of the area, or other
evidence of its aesthetic values;
should set up a restricted zone near Princess Elisabeth Station, so
that cumulative levels of air borne contamination in the vicinity of
the station could be measured and compared with the more pristine
sites protected in the proposed ASPA
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications,
the plan was likely to be effective in achieving the stated objectives
for management of the Area.
In second week of March 2023, SGMP submitted checklist
endorsing coordinator’s comments stating that proponents have
considered the SGMPs advice, and revised the draft management
plan in accordance with the advice given. However proponents
were not able to provide the updated maps and figures together
with their revised plan, but committed to provide maps and figures,
considering the commitment the revised draft management plan is
likely to be effective in achieving the management objectives for
the Area.
In first week of April 2023, Belgium provided an updated draft
management plan and other suggested documents as advised by
SGMP, explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice.
The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was
well written, of high quality, and proponents have closely
considered the SGMP's advice and have addressed the large
majority of the SGMP's suggestions. Therefore, the revised draft
management plan is improved and likely to be effective in
achieving the management objectives for the Area. The resulting
revised draft management plan and updated figures are presented in
Attachment B to this
Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared
by Belgium are presented at Appendix C.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP recommends that the CEP approves the “Proposal for a
new Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of the Western Sør
Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctic”
(Attachment B).
Review of other draft Management Plans under ToRs 1 to 3
At CEP XV (2012) the Committee considered draft revised
management plans prepared by Chile for ASPA 144 'Chile Bay'
(Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands and
ASPA 146 South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago, and
decided to refer these management plans to the SGMP for
intersessional review (CEP XV Final Report para. 92). At CEP XVII
(2014) the Committee considered further draft revised management
plans prepared by Chile for ASPA 125 Fildes Peninsula, King George
(25 de Mayo) Island and ASPA 150 Ardley Island (Ardley
Peninsula), Maxwell Bay, King George (25 de Mayo) Island, and
decided to refer these management plans to the SGMP for
intersessional review (CEP XXVII Final Report para. 153).
At CEP XXIV (2022), Chile submitted IP 128 Analysis of the current
status of the Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 144, Chile Bay
(Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island. Chile informed the Committee
of a review taking place on the de-designation of ASPA No. 144. It
noted that analysis was being carried out according to the CEP’s
Guidelines for de-designation of ASPAs, and that its full analysis
was presented in IP 128. Chile noted that it intended to submit a
Working Paper with a final conclusion related to revision of the
ASPA for Members’ consideration at CEP XXV.
The SGMP has reported during CEP XXIV that Chile intended to
submit; draft management plans for ASPA 125 Fildes Peninsula,
ASPA 146 South Bay and ASPA 150 Ardley Island before next CEP
meeting to SGMP for review. The management plans are still under
review by the proponent (Chile), so there is no progress to report at
the time of the presentation of this paper.
Task under ToRs 4 and 6
“Work with relevant Parties to ensure progress on review of
management plans overdue for five-year review”
Through the SGMP forum, Parties were invited to contact the SGMP
if they so wished. No requests were received from Parties that may
need advice to initiate the five-year review of Management Plans,
but we should recall that the SGMP is available to advise, facilitate
or guide the review tasks when necessary. A list of the Management
Plan of ASPA and Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) due for
review during ATCM XLV is attached at Appendix D.
Pre-meeting review of all Management Plans with minor changes
and submit a summary of recommendations to CEP
Based on experiences from the pre-meeting subforum review of
revised management plans to CEP XXIII, consider options for
efficient pre-meeting review of revised management plans
submitted to the CEP for consideration and adoption.
The establishment of the pre-meeting discussions on management
plans was a response to the shortened, virtual meeting in 2021. At
CEP XXIV, members supported the idea of a pre-meeting review of
revised management plans to guide and streamline the revision
process, noting that early reviews could help save valuable time
during the meeting. Some Members also emphasised that all CEP
Members may become active members of the SGMP and that broad
participation in 2021 proved effective (CEP XXIV report para 166).
The Committee agreed to add a new SGMP Term of Reference to
reflect the new regular task of pre-meeting review of Management
Plans. To initiate this task, a separate sub-forum created, posting
relevant documents in the forum by the moderator, Polly Penhale
(USA).
Since the pre meeting review of the Management can only be
started after the due date of submission of the WP to the XLV-
ATCM, following timeline and action adopted to achieve the
objective:
March 1, 2023: (Optional) Proponents of management plans may
contact the moderator to make plans for submission known, such as
ASPA/ASMA number or name of proposed ASPA/ASMA
April 14, 2023: Working Paper deadline
April 16, 2023: Moderator begins to review management plans
submitted as Working Papers to ATCM/CEP and may contact the
proponent directly before the posting, to identify apparent issues
April 30, 2023 (or earlier if possible): Initial Posting of the Opening
message, accompanied by the individual management plans under
review by the moderator, and members will be encouraged to post
comments
May 7, 2023: Moderator begins to assemble a spreadsheet of issues
raised and outcomes of the discussion
May 19, 2023: Closing date of comments by the members on the
management plans
May 22, 2023: Summary of Discussions shall be submitted to the
SGMP Convener
Review and update SGMP work plan
To implement CCRWP action 2(e) "Review and revise where
necessary existing management tools for protection and subsequent
management of environments and habitats at risk from climate
change," consider if and how they effectively take climate change
issues into consideration.
The SGMP in the 2022/23 intersessional period had as a task under
its ToR 6 to ‘Review and revise where necessary existing
management tools for protection and subsequent management of
environments and habitats at risk from climate change,’ and
‘consider if and how they effectively consider climate change issues.
A discussion among the CEP/SGMP members/Observers initiated in
a separate sub-forum under the SGMP workplan to effectively
define the roadmap and implementation of the CCRWP task.
Members discussed this task through two rounds of discussions. A
full record of this discussion is retained on the CEP Discussion
Forum. As a conclusion, however, it was widely accepted the need
to review and revise where necessary existing management tools for
protection and subsequent management of environments and
habitats at risk from climate change,’ and
‘consider if and how they effectively consider climate change
issues.  The SGMP members discussed whether it would be best to
either (a) update existing management tools documents, or (b)
develop a new guidance document.  Currently it is considered that
the best way forward will be to carefully chose the document which
needs urgent attention and subsequently revised them one after
one.
Discussions so far indicate that it may be appropriate to prioritize in
the first-round review of the Guidelines for implementation of the
Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the
Environmental Protocol. Annex to Resolution 1 (2000) and the
(Revised) Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for
Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. The SGMP will initiate this
work in the next intersessional period, and report back to CEP XXVI
on progress.
Proposed Work Plan for the SGMP, for the intersessional period
2023-24
The SGMP proposes the following Work Plan, to which other
actions that CEP XXV may consider appropriate may be added.

Advice to the CEP
The SGMP provides the following advice to CEP:
that the three management plans pending in the previous periods
continue to be within the scope of the SGMP, in order to provide
advice once the proposing country has made the revised versions
available to the Group and that the CEP endorses the proposal to
explore mechanisms and additional tools to facilitate the review of
pending plans;
that the CEP approves the management plan; ASPA 152 “Western
Bransfield Strait and No. 153 Eastern Dallmann Bay”;
that the CEP approves the new management plan; “Proposal for a
new Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of the Western Sør
Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctic”;
that the CEP consider under ToR 5, pre-meeting review of revised
Management Plans, such as the approach in advance of CEP, as a
standing practice;
that the CEP consider to under ToR 6 to continue the discussion
under the action plan of SGCCR to develop guidance for addressing
climate change in the process of identifying and managing
protected areas;
that the CEP consider the Work Plan and suggests appropriate
modifications if needed, based on the deliberations during CEP
XXV.
Appendix A Revised Terms of Reference for the Subsidiary Group
on Management Plans. (CEP XIV, Final Report. Appendix 4)
The original four Terms of Reference for the SGMP were defined in
Appendix 3 of the CEP XI (2008) report. Following a review of the
effectiveness of the SGMP at CEP XIII (2010), a fifth Term of
Reference was added. In 2022, an additional Term of Reference was
introduced to reflect the new regular task of pre-meeting review of
Management Plans. The current Terms of Reference are presented
in Appendix 4 to the CEP XXIV report:
Examine any draft new or revised Management Plan recommended
by the Committee for intersessional review to consider, in
consultation with relevant experts if appropriate:
whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the
Protocol, particularly, Articles 3, 4 and 51, and with relevant CEP
guidelines2;
its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness3;
whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation4; and
whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the
Antarctic protected
areas system as a whole5.
Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft
Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.
Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the
adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management
Plan, identifying where the Plan reflects comments received by
Members, and where they have not been, the reasons for not doing
so. The Working Paper is to include all revised Management Plans
and the information required by the ATCM's Legal and Institutional
Working Group.
Operate a pre-meeting subforum on the review of all revised
Management Plans with minor changes, irrespective of whether or
not they have been submitted to the SGMP, and provide a summary
of the recommendations arising from the pre-meeting review for
consideration by the CEP during the discussion of revised
management plans.
Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving
Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review.
Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a
long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA
management plans contain adequate content, and are clear,
consistent and likely to be effective6

Appendix B: Introductory Comments by United States
Revision and merger of the Management Plans for Antarctic
Specially Protected Areas No. 152 Western Bransfield Strait and No.
153 Eastern Dallmann Bay
The management plans for ASPA No. 152 Western Bransfield Strait
and ASPA No.153 Eastern Dallmann Bay were last reviewed in
2015, and review therefore fell due in 2020. Accordingly, the
United States has undertaken a comprehensive review of these sites
in close consultation with scientists working in the Area. The review
verified that the values under special protection at these sites are
still valid and that measures for protection of those values are
sufficient.
The review identified that ASPA No.152 and ASPA No.153 share
common purposes, aims, objectives and management policies, and
scientific activities within these areas are also similar. As such, the
United States proposed a merger of the two ASPAs into a single plan
covering both sites. The United States considered the modifications
proposed to the management plan were major, and therefore the
plan was referred for consideration intersessionally by the SGMP.
In November 2022 the SGMP provided its advice to the United
States recommending consideration of changes to the revised
management plan. The United States thanks the SGMP for advice
provided, and as a result made a range of modifications and updates
to the management plan and maps.
In January 2023, the United States provided an updated draft
management plan and maps and a separate document explaining its
responses to the SGMP’s advice for consideration by the SGMP.
The United States welcomes the advice of the SGMP that the revised
management plan, with the modifications made as a result of the
SGMP advice, be recommended by the CEP for adoption by the
ATCM.
As per Decision 9 (2005), the management plan was submitted to
CCAMLR for consideration of whether the provisions in the plan
might prevent or restrict CCAMLR related activities.
The Commission did not reach consensus to approve the revised
management plan for merging ASPAs Nos 152 and 153; thus, the
ATCM may not adopt the revised management plan at this time.
The United States plans to resubmit the current draft of the
management plan for merging ASPAs Nos 152 and 153 to CCAMLR
in 2023.

two spatially separate components: Site A and Site B which are in
the same location as the existing ASPAs.
(vi) Other - brief summary of other types of changes, indicating the
paragraphs of the management plan in which these are located.
The description of the Area merges the text in the existing
management plans into a single narrative. The scientific description
of the Area has been updated to reflect recent information and
results.
5. If a new ASPA or ASMA is proposed, does it contain any marine
area?
Yes, the merged ASPA contains the marine areas of ASPAs No.152
and No.153.
6. If yes, does the proposal require the prior approval of CCAMLR in
accordance with Decision 9 (2005)?
ASPAs No.152 and No.153 are already approved by CCAMLR in
accordance with ATCM Decision 9 (2005) and are listed in the
CCAMLR Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2022/23
(Annex 91-02/A).
7. If yes, has the prior approval of CCAMLR been obtained?
Approval exists for the existing ASPAs.
If yes, please list the CCAMLR Final Report and Paragraph No.
N/A
8. If the proposal relates to an ASPA, what is the primary reason for
designation (i.e., which part under Article 3.2 of Annex V)?
The primary reason for designation is to protect the shallow shelves
in the marine region in western Bransfield Strait and eastern
Dallmann Bay which are used for
scientific studies of the composition, structure and dynamics of
marine communities. Under Article 3.2 of Annex V the main reason
for special protection is:
(e) areas of particular interest to on-going or planned scientific
research.
9. Have you identified the main Environmental Domain represented
by the ASPA/ASMA (Resolution 3 (2008))?
N/A. The EDA classification is based on terrestrial criteria, and
therefore has limited applicability in the marine environment.
10. Have you identified the main Antarctic Conservation
Biogeographic Region represented by the ASPA/ASMA (Resolution
3 (2017))?
N/A. The ACBR classification is based on terrestrial criteria, and
therefore has limited applicability in the marine environment.

Appendix C: Introductory Comments by Belgium
Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of the
Western Sør Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East
Antarctic
The Sør Rondane Mountains are located approximately 200 km
inland (71°–72° S/20°–30° E), in the Eastern part of Dronning Maud
Land, East Antarctica, and form a typical coastal margin
mountainous area, composed of a series of nunataks. The proposed
multi-site ASPA in parts of the Western Sør Rondane Mountains
(71°50’-72°S; 22°50’-23°50’E) includes seven ice-free areas:
Tanngarden Nunatak and Ridge, Petrellnuten Nunatak, range of
seven Pingvinane Nunataks, two Nunataks of the Perlebandet range,
a small part of the Teltet Nunatak, the Yuboku Valley. The proposed
management plan includes the designation of two Pingvinane
Nunataks as prohibited zones in order to allow future research to
compare these inviolate reference sites with similar localities that
have been affected by human activities.
The objective of the proposed ASPA is to protect scientific,
environmental, aesthetic and wilderness values. The primary reason
for designating several sites of the Western Sør Rondane Mountains
as an ASPA is to protect the unique terrestrial biodiversity and
ecosystem features of the area that are also the subject of scientific
research on the biodiversity, evolution and function of the
biological communities, including their (micro)organisms, and the
impact of climate change on these values. The selected sites are
representative of the natural terrestrial biological communities
typical for inland Antarctic mountainous regions. Therefore, the
proposed ASPA would increase the representation of mountainous
habitats in the Antarctic protected areas system.
Belgium presented a prior assessment for the proposed ASPA at CEP
XX (WP42 Prior assessment of a proposed Antarctic Specially
Protected Area (ASPA) in the Sør Rondane Mountains). Belgium
responded to questions raised by several Members of the Committee
with regard to the prior assessment in CEP XXI IP 42 Update on the
proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) in the Western
Sør Rondane Mountains. At CEP XXIV, Belgium presented a revised
version of the proposed Management Plan in WP 15 Proposal for a
new Antarctic Specially Protected Area in parts of the Western Sør
Rondane Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctic. During
this meeting, the CEP reaffirmed that it had recognised that the
outstanding values of the site warranted protection and had
forwarded the draft management plan for the area to the SGMP for
review.
In response to comments received from the SGMP, Belgium revised
the proposed management plan. The most notable revisions were
the following: changes to and improvement of the maps provided in
line with the comments by the SGMP; the addition of information
on the presence of birds in the general area and on the different
sites; the addition of information on the potential impact of climate
change; the addition of information on the aesthetic and wilderness
values of the Area, including an Appendix with pictures; the
inclusion of 500m buffer zones around each site to protect the
microbial life against potential pollution from motorized vehicles;
the addition of information on the lakes present in Yûboku-dani
Valley (site F) as well as the enlargement of the surface area of this
site in order to capture as best as possible the catchment area for
these lakes; the addition of an aim to ‘minimise the possibility of
the introduction of pathogens which may cause disease in fauna
populations within the Area’; the addition of measures to protect
from transfer of species from site to site within the Area; the
addition of references to relevant SCAR and COMNAP guidelines
and codes of conduct.
The revised management plan is presented to the CEP for approval.

Appendix D : Status of Antarctic Specially Protected Area and
Antarctic Specially Managed Area Management Plans
At the 8th meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection
(CEP) in 2005 the Committee agreed to establish on the websites of
the CEP and the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty a register of the
status of the protected area management plans.
The following tables indicate the status of the Antarctic Specially
Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas
(ASMAs) adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
The tables present the following information:
The protected/managed areas are listed according to the official
numbers given to the ASPAs/ASMAs;
The names are those agreed in Decision 1 (2002) and further
Measures adopted by the ATCM;
The Recommendation (or Measure) through which the area was
designated is shown in one column while other Recommendations,
Measures, Decisions and Resolutions that relate to updating the
management plan, extending the expiry date, etc, are listed as a
separate column;
The Recommendation (or Measure) through which the first
management plan for the area was adopted is marked with an
asterisk (*);
Recommendations through which management plan expiry dates
have been extended are marked (E);
“Annex V format adoption” refers to the year of adoption of the
management plan according to the Protocol;
“Next review” informs the deadline for five yearly review of the
management plan, as required by Article 6.3 of Annex V;
Additionally, information is provided on the Environmental
Domain, Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Region and
Important Bird Areas associated with any ASPA or ASMA
Note: Those ASPAs or ASMAs whose management plans were
revoked are shown in italics.
