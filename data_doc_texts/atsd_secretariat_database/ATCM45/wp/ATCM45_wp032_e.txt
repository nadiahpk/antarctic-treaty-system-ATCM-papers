Report of the intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) to
Review the Draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation
prepared by Argentina for the ‘Redevelopment of Petrel Station,
Dundee Island, Antarctica’
Working Paper submitted by New Zealand
Summary
An intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) was established
in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP
consideration of draft CEEs to consider the draft Comprehensive
Environmental Evaluation (CEE) prepared by Argentina for the
‘Redevelopment of Petrel Station, Dundee Island, Antarctica’.
Participants commended Argentina for the preparation of the draft
CEE and several aspects of its proposal. On the basis of comments
provided by participants, the ICG advises the CEP that the draft CEE
is generally well structured and largely conforms to the
requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection.
However, the ICG noted that while the draft CEE contains well-
presented high-level summaries of the environmental aspects,
potential impacts of the proposed activity and mitigation measures
(Annex’s 2-6), the supporting description of the proposed activity in
the main body of the CEE is lacking information, making it difficult
to assess whether the environmental impacts of the proposed
activities on the environment have been identified and whether the
suggested mitigation measures are appropriate. The ICG identified a
number of aspects for which additional information or clarification
would be useful to include in a final CEE, if Argentina plans to
proceed with the proposed activity.
Background
On 30 January, 2023 Argentina notified the CEP Chair of the
availability of the draft CEE for the ‘Redevelopment of Petrel
Station, Dundee Island, Antarctica’. The draft CEE was prepared by
the Environmental Management and Tourism Programme of the
Argentine National Antarctic Directorate.
The full document, was available for download from https://
drive.google.com/drive/
folders/1PyF_Oo0xKcMEAgXf5ZEnjIhuUa2W9VG6
and via the CEP Workspace on the website of the Secretariat of the
Antarctic Treaty: https://www.ats.aq/devAS/EP/CEPWorkspace.
In accordance with the Procedures for intersessional consideration
of Draft CEEs (CEP XX Final Report, Appendix 3) the CEP Chair
issued:
CEP Circular 3 / CEP XXV (31 January 2023), which:
advised CEP contact points of the availability of the draft CEE;
advised of the need to establish an open-ended intersessional
contact group (ICG) to review the draft CEE;
proposed that New Zealand’s CEP representative, Ms Ceisha Poirot,
convene the ICG;
proposed terms of reference for the ICG; and
invited CEP Members to comment on the proposed convener and /
or terms of reference.
CEP Circular 4 / CEP XXV (15 February, 2023), which noted that
no comments had been received on the proposed convener or terms
of reference.
Terms of reference
The ICG addressed the four standard terms of reference outlined in
the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs:
The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of
Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol
Whether the CEE: i) has identified all the environmental impacts of
the proposed activity; and ii) suggests appropriate methods of
mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts
Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported
by the information contained within the document
The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE
Method of operation
All ICG correspondence was available to CEP Members and
Observers via the CEP Discussion Forum. A link to the Spanish and
English language versions of the full draft CEE was posted to the
Discussion Forum, with all language versions made available via the
CEP Workspace once full translations of the CEE were completed.
All languages of the Non-Technical Summary and the template for
comment were posted to the Discussion Forum.
ICG participants were reminded by the CEP Chair and ICG convener
of the CEP’s agreement that the Procedures for intersessional
consideration of Draft CEEs do not detract from the right of any
Party to the Protocol to raise an issue on a draft CEE at meetings of
the CEP or at an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM).
The ICG commenced with an opening message from the convener
on 8 March, 2023 and an initial comment period from that date
until 29 March, 2023. The convener circulated a draft ICG report
for comment on 8 April, 2023 and prepared a final report,
addressing comments received, by the 14 April, 2021 deadline for
submission of Working Papers to CEP XXV.
Summary of comments received from ICG participants
Comments were submitted to the ICG by ten CEP Members
(Australia, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, France, Germany, New Zealand,
Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States) and one
Observer (ASOC). The following sections summarise the main points
raised by ICG participants, in accordance with the ICG terms of
reference. The full submissions provided by participants are
available in the CEP Discussion Forum. If Argentina decides to
proceed with the proposed activity, it should also have reference to
the matters raised in those full submissions.
Participants commended Argentina for the preparation of the draft
CEE and several aspects of its proposal, including the plans to
utilise a location already subject to human disturbance from
previous activities, to address legacy environmental issues through
the removal of disused facilities and associated materials, the plans
to maximise energy efficiency and use renewable energy
methodologies to meet energy requirements, to establish advanced
scientific facilities and make them available for international
collaboration, and to implement a comprehensive environmental
monitoring program.
However, it was considered that some parts of the draft CEE might
be improved in the light of the detailed comments set out below.
The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of
Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.
ICG participants considered that the draft CEE largely and broadly
conforms to the formal requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the
Environmental Protocol. However, in their reviews, participants
identified a number of aspects for which additional information or
clarification would be useful to include in a final CEE, if Argentina
plans to proceed with the proposed activity. In the following, a
summary of these comments is provided against the requirements of
Annex I, Article 3.2.
Description of the proposed activity including its purpose, location,
duration and intensity, and possible alternatives to the activity,
including the alternative of not proceeding, and the consequences
of those alternatives (Annex I, Article 3.2(a))
Participants considered that the proposed activity, including its
purpose, location, duration and intensity were described in
Chapters 1, 2 and 4. In some areas there was a large amount of
technical detail provided, with some areas lacking in information
regarding the impacts on the environment. There was repetition
and lack of consistency of information across these chapters which
led to a lack of clarity of what was in scope for the CEE, what stage
of the renovation had already been completed and what activities
had been considered but excluded from the proposed activities, of
which the latter should be moved to the consideration of
alternatives. Despite the comprehensive information provided,
participants suggested that additional detail could be included on:
the planned intensity of operations at the station over the 30-year
design life (including the number of people per season at the
station);
a description of the projected waste and wastewater production
during the construction and operational phases of the activity;
an estimate of fuel use during the construction and operational
phases of the activity;
estimated ship-to-shore operations (including movement of
passengers and cargo) during the construction and operational
phases of the activity, including fuel transfer and spill prevention
during resupply operations;
how non-native species introductions will be minimised or
prevented;
the rational/operational need for the construction of two runways,
rather than one, and how this outweighs the additional
environmental impact;
the anticipated frequency and timing of aircraft movements;
the location and nature of ancillary infrastructure, such as roads
and scientific installations (e.g. masts, communications antennas,
pipelines) to be established to support planned logistics and
research activities;
a more comprehensive description of the historical wastes and site
contamination and the extent to which removal/remediation is
planned and whether the clean-up will include management of
residual contaminants in the soil (e.g. hydrocarbons, heavy metals,
asbestos);
whether the proposed activities have been planned to facilitate
eventual decommissioning (of the base or the runway) in a manner
that minimises environmental impacts; and
plans, if any, for the facilities to be available to support tourism
activities.
Regarding the consideration of alternatives, participants considered
that Chapter 5 provides a thorough consideration of alternatives,
including the alternative of not proceeding. Participants suggested
that additional detail or consideration of the following could be
consider for inclusion in a final CEE:
why the alternative of not proceeding, and the clean-up of Petrel
Base and Cape Welchness more comprehensively, was not
considered;
options to restore the local ecosystems and remove historical debris;
why other stations and existing infrastructure in Antarctica,
belonging to Argentina or other Parties, were not considered (other
than the Marambio Base), to provide a more fulsome examination
of international cooperation, distances from other logistics facilities
or other aspects as alternatives to the redevelopment;
the option of importing aggregate instead of quarrying local
materials;
constructing only one runway rather than two and whether a longer
(1800 or 2100 m) runway extending into the nearshore marine
environment is more suitable or not;
the construction of an asphalt runway surface vs. gravel;
the construction of a pier / wharf and associated infrastructure;
scheduling elements of the construction activities and aviation
operations to avoid sensitive periods for local wildlife (e.g.
moulting, fledging); and
alternatives to drawing domestic water from the nearby lagoons.
Description of the initial environmental reference state with which
predicted changes are to be compared and a prediction of the future
environmental reference state in the absence of the proposed
activity (Annex I, Article 3.2(b));
Participants considered that Chapter 6 comprehensively describes
the environment of the broader northern Antarctic Peninsula and
surrounding environment, as well as the geographic and physical
characteristics of Dundee Island but does not provided a
comprehensive description of the environment and the particular
sensitivities of Cape Welchness where the proposed activities are
planned to take place.
Participants suggested that further details should be provided
regarding:
development of, and presentation of the results of a baseline survey
of the environment of the area including vegetation composition
and distribution, freshwater biodiversity, terrestrial invertebrate
biodiversity and marine intertidal biodiversity;
the existing physical disturbance footprint (i.e. the size and location
of areas of the landscape at Cape Welchness that have already been
disturbed by human activities);
the presence and distribution of terrestrial flora and fauna and
proximity to the various elements of the proposed activity,
including aircraft flight paths;
the nearshore marine environment in the vicinity of the proposed
activity (e.g. marine communities, habitats, macroalgae,
invertebrates, hydrodynamics);
the locations, nature and extent of contaminated sites associated
with past activities;
environmental features in the vicinity of the quarries and water
supply lagoons; and
wilderness and aesthetic values, taking into consideration past
activities.
Participants indicated that the predicted future state of the
environment was also not explicitly clear. Some descriptions had
been presented (e.g. climate change) but a dedicated section could
be included. In addition, it was suggested that Argentina should
clean up the historical waste at this site, regardless if the proposed
activity goes ahead or not.
Description of the methods used to forecast the impacts of the
proposed activity (Annex I, Article 3.2(c))
Participants thought there was clear methodology described (in
Section 7.1) but further detail could be provided regarding the data
used to forecast the impacts and a review of the assessments
provided in the annexes which for some impacts did not seem
accurate, and some likely impacts were noted as being absent. One
participant was not clear on the use of a fifth factor relating to
‘legal aspects’ that was included in the significance calculation and
further information could be provided on its use.
Estimation of the nature, extent, duration, and intensity of the
likely direct impacts of the proposed activity (Annex I, Article
3.2(d)) and Consideration of possible indirect or second order
impacts of the proposed activity (Annex I, Article 3.2(e));
Participants noted that this has been considered and included in the
annexes impact assessment tables though it was thought that they
were limited in content and some impacts may have been
overlooked or absent.
Consideration of cumulative impacts of the proposed activity in the
light of existing activities and other known planned activities
(Annex I, Article 3.2(f));
Participants suggested this section of the draft CEE (Section 7.6) did
not have enough detail to provide a proper assessment of
cumulative impacts and could provide a greater explanation and
further detail to better understand the conclusions described in this
section.
Identification of measures, including monitoring programmes, that
could be taken to minimise or mitigate impacts of the proposed
activity and to detect unforeseen impacts and that could provide
early warning of any adverse effects of the activity as well as to
deal promptly and effectively with accidents; (Annex I, Article
3.2(g))
Participants noted that mitigation measures are identified in the
impact assessment tables in Annex 2-6. The monitoring programme
is included in Chapter 8 and it is noted that details of the
monitoring programme are still to be developed once the station is
operational. It is not clear what monitoring will be carried out
during the redevelopment phases to detect any unforeseen adverse
impacts of the activities on the Antarctic environment as well as to
deal promptly and effectively with environmental accidents.
Participants suggested further thought was needed on the frequency
of some monitoring and the consideration/inclusion of terrestrial/
soil invertebrate surveys. Further information is provided under
ToR#2.
Identification of unavoidable impacts of the proposed activity
(Annex I, Article 3.2(h));
The participants noted that unavoidable impacts were not explicitly
identified but could be inferred from the impact assessment tables
in Annex 2 to 6.
Consideration of the effects of the proposed activity on the conduct
of scientific research and on other existing uses and values (Annex
1, Article 3.2 (i)):
Participants noted that the draft CEE indicates that the purpose of
the proposed activity is to establish a new science and logistics hub
for Argentina’s Antarctic program to support the science
programme and to facilitate international cooperation, but
suggested that the CEE should describe the effects, if any, of the
proposed activity on the conduct of scientific research or on other
existing uses, as the information provided was considered relatively
limited.
An identification of gaps in knowledge and uncertainties
encountered in compiling the information required under this
paragraph; (Annex I, Article 3.2(j))
The participants noted that Section 9 of the draft CEE describes
knowledge gaps but suggested that some additional gaps and
uncertainties evident from the remainder of the document, together
with an indication of what steps will be taken to address them,
should be considered including:
the current state of the nearshore marine environment and a
detailed understanding of the diversity, abundance and distribution
of terrestrial biota;
the amount of wastes expected to be generated during station
operations, and the planned approach to managing solid
biodegradable wastes and waste water (including effluent discharge
location);
locations for discharge to the marine environment of waste water
effluent and brine from the reverse osmosis plant;
implications of runway construction for the local hydrology /
drainage and flow into the marine environment;
locations, volume and types of historical wastes and ground
contamination; and
the uncertainties around interaction of the runway and the moraine
under different climate change scenarios, especially given the
impacts already experienced at Marambio Base.
A non-technical summary of the information provided under this
paragraph; (Annex I, Article 3.2(k)) and The name and address of
the person or organization which prepared the Comprehensive
Environmental Evaluation and the address to which comments
thereon should be directed (Annex I, Article 3.2(l)).
The participants noted the Executive Summary, contact details on
the front cover and Section 12 which list the authors and advisors.
Whether the CEE: i) has identified all the environmental impacts of
the proposed activity; and ii) suggests appropriate methods of
mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts
Participants noted that the proposed activity is complex but the
draft CEE has broadly identified the majority of environmental
impacts of the proposed activity and outlines the activities to be
undertaken to mitigate (reduce or avoid) those impacts.
However, despite a detailed technical description of Petrel Base
Renovation (Chapters 1, 2 and 4) and a description of the
environment (Chapter 6), some elements of the proposed activity
are lacking in information regarding the impacts on the
environment (as outlined under ToR#1) and consequently, the full
impacts of the proposed activities on the environment are hard to
assess.
While Annex 2 - 6 of the draft CEE contain well-presented high-
level summaries of the environmental aspects, potential impacts of
the proposed activity and mitigation measures, the supporting
description in the main body of the CEE (Chapter 7) is lacking or
absent, making it difficult to determine whether the environmental
impacts of the proposed activities on the environment have been
identified and whether the suggested mitigation measures are
appropriate.
Potential areas for improvement include:
a more detailed description of the planned activities (including, for
example, on construction methods, quarrying methods, use of
stockpile areas, and presence and use of roadways between the
different areas of the site);
identification and description of the environmental aspects that will
arise from the planned activities;
clear descriptions of how the identified aspects will impact upon the
environment;
a dedicated and detailed section on management and/or mitigation
measures with a full description of the proposed mitigation
measures, including measures M1-M30 referenced in Annexes 2 to 6
as well as mitigation measures for environmental impacts not
already identified;
clarify that mitigation measures will be implemented for all impacts
of low significance, as evident from Annexes 2 to 6, which reflects
an appropriately precautionary approach; and
provide links to / summaries of supporting management plans (e.g.
Base Contingency Plan, Wildlife Manual, Waste Management Plan,
Small Boat Manual, Directive for Work Abroad of the Argentine
Antarctic Program).
Having the impact assessment tables split into the different
activities (i.e. the repair, maintenance and demolition of original
facilities (Annex 2); the construction of new buildings (Annex 3);
the construction, use and maintenance of the airport area (Annex
4); the construction of the photovoltaic power plant (Annex 5) and
the water supply lagoons (Annex 6)) is useful. However, it was
suggested this did not allow a thorough assessment of activities that
would be
happening in parallel as it appeared they were considered
individually. Therefore, consideration could further be given to how
the impact assessment tables are presented in the final CEE.
The participants suggested that some environmental impacts may
have been overlooked or not consider and could be discussed as
relevant in the final CEE. These may include:
impacts to the marine environment, associated with:
the extension of the runway(s) into the nearshore marine
environment;
the runway earthworks and potential erosion, dust generation and
sediment runoff from planned drainage channels, existing streams
and rills;
disposal of brine from the reverse osmosis plant; and
ship to shore operations, including use of landing barges and fuel
transfer;
impacts to terrestrial flora and fauna associated with dust generated
during demolition activities, and construction and operation of the
runway and other new facilities;
impacts of light pollution and new structures (e.g. masts, windows)
on flying birds;
impacts on wildlife and vegetation at Cape Welchness arising from
an increase in human activities following redevelopment of the
station (i.e. increased scientific and logistics activities and
personnel);
impacts from the presence and visibility of the station and facilities
in the Antarctic landscape (e.g. impacts to wilderness and aesthetic
values);
habitat and ecosystem level impacts of construction and ongoing
operation;
human health impacts, noting there is no permanent human
population in the vicinity of the base, the effects on construction
and other personnel could be considered;
impacts of the chlorine that will be used in the treatment (and
disposal) of the wastewater;
impacts from noise and atmospheric emissions during construction
and operational stages;
potable water requirements per person and for the whole operation;
and
possible impacts on cooperation with other nations and nearby
stations in terms of logistic operations.
Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported
by the information contained within the document.
The participants all agreed that due to the scale and complexity of
the proposed activities outlined in the CEE for the Redevelopment
of Petrel Station, the impacts are likely to have more than a minor
or transitory impact on the environment and that a CEE is the
appropriate level of environmental impact assessment for the
proposed activity.
However, ICG participants felt that the conclusion of the draft CEE
does not align with the environmental impact assessment and
identified mitigation measures presented in Annex 2-6. Noting that
Chapter 11 of the draft CEE states that, ‘Of a total of 209
environmental impacts estimated in the original assessment, 102
were low risk, 83 medium risk and 24 high risk. After the
mitigation measures were proposed, finally 200 were low risk, 9
medium risk and none high risk’, participants thought this
assessment seemed unlikely and optimistic and indicated that a
review of the environmental impact assessment and a more
thorough description and consideration of mitigation measures was
needed to support the conclusion of the CEE.
The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE
ICG participants commented generally that the draft CEE is a clear,
well-structured, well written, thorough document. However, due to
the complexity of the proposed activities, participants suggested the
following improvements to enhance the presentation and clarity of
the document:
Consolidate the description of the station and renovation project,
particularly Chapter’s 2 and 4, into one chapter to avoid duplication
or repetition of information;
Ensure clarity of the information presented to avoid confusion of
the proposed activities. For example, contradicting information is
presented which makes it unclear whether or not the port facility
has been included or discarded;
Reorganise some of the information presented to improve the flow
of information for the reader, moving important context
information sooner in the document;
Remove or relocate technical/engineering information into an
annex where not relevant to the assessment of environmental
impacts. This will support reduction in the overall size of the
document;
Move the environmental impact assessment tables into the body of
the text and discuss the impacts more comprehensively within the
document to support understanding of the impacts and review the
colour coding used in the tables for accuracy and consistency;
Dedicate a section to describe the mitigation measures and effects
they mitigate within the document;
Include a ‘List of Figures’, a ‘List of Tables’ and a ‘List of Acronyms’
with the Table of Contents and ensure the Table of Contents
matches the structure of the document;
Ensure that all Figures and Tables are labelled and referred to
accurately in the text of the document as many are mislabelled or
missing;
Ensure the use of acronyms are explained first before use across the
document;
Improve the resolution and clarity of maps and figures throughout
the document, ensuring they are appropriately labelled, and
translated where possible, as many figure labels were unreadable;
Ensure all maps include a scale, orientation and legend; and
Remove the reference to the ‘Argentine Antarctic Territory’ (page
40).
Conclusions
Having reviewed the draft CEE prepared by Argentina for the
‘Redevelopment of Petrel Station, Dundee Island, Antarctica’ in
accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration
of draft CEEs, the ICG advises the CEP that:
The draft CEE largely conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of
Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty, although there is a need to address some elements
of Article 3 in greater detail.
Argentina should consider the issues raised during the ICG and, if it
decides to proceed with the proposed activity, there are several
aspects for which additional information or clarification should be
provided in the required final CEE. These matters are outlined in
detail in the submissions made by participants, and are summarised
in this ICG report. In particular, the Committee’s attention is drawn
to the suggestions that further details should be provided regarding:
the description of the proposed activity, particularly including more
detail of both construction of, and operational activities of the
future station such as water consumption and management, waste
and wastewater management, fuel management, ship to shore
activities (i.e. passengers, cargo and fuel supply/delivery), runway
operations, clean-up of legacy waste and prevention of non-native
species introduction;
alternatives to the proposed activity, including further examination
of not proceeding and the comprehensive clean-up of Petrel Base
and Cape Welchness more broadly, a more thorough analysis of
why other stations and existing
infrastructure in Antarctica were not suitable and options regarding
the number and construction alternatives for the runway(s) and
port;
the initial environmental reference state, including a more
comprehensive assessment of terrestrial and nearshore flora and
fauna and extent of human disturbance and contamination at the
station site and Cape Welchness more widely;
the methodology used to forecast the impacts of the proposed
activity, including how impact significance ratings were determined
given the scale and complexity of the proposed activity and lack of
some information presented in the CEE;
a more comprehensive assessment of cumulative impacts that might
arise with the proposed activities, existing activities and other
known planned activities in the area;
a more comprehensive assessment and description of the mitigation
measures, including for impacts not addressed or sufficiently well
described;
the environmental monitoring program before, during and after
construction activities; and
gaps in knowledge, particularly including the understanding of the
diversity, abundance and distribution of flora and fauna in the
terrestrial and nearshore marine environment, details of operational
issues such as number of people, waste and wastewater generation
and discharge to the environment, aircraft activities and impacts of
runway construction for the local hydrology / drainage and flow
into the marine environment, locations, volume and types of
historical wastes and ground contamination and the uncertainties
around interaction of the runway and the moraine under different
climate change scenarios, especially given the impacts already
experienced at Marambio Base.
Due to the scale and complexity of the proposed activities outlined
in the CEE for the Redevelopment of Petrel Station, impacts on the
environment are likely to have more than a minor or transitory
impact on the environment and that a CEE is the appropriate level
of environmental impact assessment for the proposed activity.
However, the conclusion of the draft CEE does not align with the
environmental impact assessment and identified mitigation
measures and it is suggested that a review of the environmental
impact assessment and a more thorough description and
consideration of mitigation measures was needed to support the
conclusion of the CEE.
The draft CEE is generally clear, well structured, and well-presented
although due to the scale and complexity of the proposed activities,
suggestions were made to enhance the presentation and clarity of
the document.
