Infrastructure supporting tourism and other non-governmental
activities in Antarctica
Infrastructure supporting tourism and other non-governmental
activities in Antarctica
Summary
ATCM XLIV (§ 229 of the Final Report) agreed to continue an
Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) on permanent facilities for
tourism and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica. In
three rounds of discussions, the ICG made an inventory of existing
permanent and semi-permanent infrastructure currently used or co-
used for tourism and other non-governmental activities, exchanged
views on possible concerns relating to such facilities and discussed
the question of whether the ATCM should take action on the issue.
The report of the ICG is an attachment to this WP and should be
considered together with the proposal for a draft Resolution text in
this WP.
Introduction
During the 2021-22 ICG and ATCM XLIV several Parties and experts
noted, that where Resolution 5 (2022) focuses on preventing the
construction and/or exploitation of permanent infrastructure used
exclusively for tourism and other non-governmental activities over
multiple seasons, the broader issue of infrastructure supporting
tourism and other non-governmental activities deserves further
discussion. Therefore, ATCM XLIV decided that the ICG should
continue its work to address this issue.
The report attached to this WP summarises the lively and
productive discussions, to which a large number of Parties and
experts contributed : Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France,
Germany, Norway, United Kingdom, United States of America,
ASOC and IAATO.
Discussions focused on developing an inventory of infrastructure
supporting tourism and other non-governmental activities,
discussing potential concerns as well as potential policy responses
for consideration by ATCM XLV.
An inventory of infrastructure supporting tourism and other non-
governmental activities in Antarctica
Generally, participants indicated that they would welcome the
establishment of an inventory of permanent and semi-permanent or
temporary infrastructure in Antarctica.
Based on the ICG discussions, the following categories of
infrastructure have been distinguished for the purpose of making
the inventory, attached to the ICG-report as an annex:
Permanent infrastructure, originally and currently primarily
dedicated to science (e.g., research stations, set up and run under
the auspices of a National Program), which is co-
used to any extent In the context of this WP and attached report,
co-use refers to a secondary function of a facility, less than 50% of
the facility activities. to support tourism and other non-
governmental activities and allowing for overnight stays;
Permanent infrastructure, originally and currently or formerly
primarily dedicated to science (e.g., research stations, set up and
run under the auspices of a National Program), which only allows
for limited number of guided tours of the facility and/or for
providing information to tourists;
Permanent and semi-permanent/temporary infrastructure for
logistical support, used or co-used to any extent to support tourism
and other non-governmental activities (e.g., logistical facilities set
up and run either under the auspices of a National Program, or by a
non-governmental actor);
Permanent infrastructure originally destined for tourism and other
non-governmental activities and not falling within categories A to
C.
Semi-permanent and temporary infrastructure, originally destined
for tourism and other non-governmental activities (e.g., land based,
deep field camps and associated logistical infrastructure that are
run by a non-governmental actor).
ICG participants suggested different approaches for updating the
overview with the aim of avoiding a static, one off inventory. The
conveners have followed suggestions and consulted the Secretariat
on this issue. It was confirmed that all the necessary information
can be included in the EIES and that the repository may be updated
on the basis of the EIES.
Concerns relating to such infrastructure, including, for instance,
environmental concerns and pressure on the search and rescue
capacity of national programs
Contributions to the ICG indicated that participants are keen to
engage in developing more coherent and robust policies in relation
to tourism and NGO land-based infrastructure in Antarctica.
In the final report of the ICG to ATCM XLIV (WP36), a number of
concerns relating to permanent infrastructure for tourism and other
non-governmental activities have been identified. Most participants
in the current ICG 2022-23 expressed the view that these concerns
also apply to infrastructures, and some additional concerns have
been raised.
These additional concerns relate to the level of activity (e.g., skiing,
hiking, etc.) and ‘potential civilization problems’ (waste, sewage,
emissions and noise) that permanent and semi-permanent/
temporary infrastructure for tourism implies. It was also noted that
concerns did not only relate to new infrastructure for tourism and
other non-governmental activities but also to already existing
infrastructure originally designed for the support of National
Programs and currently also supporting tourism .
From the discussion, it became apparent that in current situations
there is often a mix of governmental and NGO activities, which may
hinder governance responses.
A number of concerns that should be dealt with as a matter of
priority have been proposed in the ICG, including on cumulative
impacts on ecosystems and wilderness values, a lack of spatial
planning to prevent expansion, risks of negative effects on scientific
research and/or scientific
values of Antarctica, the potential assertion of property rights or
‘rights to use’ and related concepts (e.g., lease), the increase of
complexity of ownership structures and related questions, for
instance in relation to liability, and increasing air traffic and related
emissions to and from Antarctica, as well as related concerns on
Search & Rescue capacity.
Proposals for the ATCM
Based on the very constructive ICG discussions and on the
conclusions contained in the ICG-report, and with a view to
ensuring transparency in tourism developments in Antarctica and to
promote progress in Antarctic tourism governance, the Netherlands,
as convener of the ICG has formulated three lines for possible
ATCM action:
Initiating further research and discussion on a number of sub-topics;
The establishment of an inventory of infrastructure for tourism and
other non-governmental activities in Antarctica to increase
transparency regarding developments (component of a Resolution);
Taking non-legally binding action that on the one hand sets certain
limits to the further increase of (co-)use of infrastructure (either
originally designed for science, logistics or tourism) for tourism and
other non-governmental activities in Antarctica, while allowing
space for governments to develop their own policy, regarding
(co-)use of infrastructure for science, e.g. in the context of National
Programs..
This results in the following proposals to the ATCM:
The inclusion in the ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan of:
An analysis of the development of air traffic to and in Antarctica to
support governmental as well as tourism and other non-
governmental activities;
An analysis of risks and benefits from the perspective of SAR of
infrastructure for tourism and other non-governmental activities in
Antarctica;
An analysis of (potential) property issues and related issues, such as
liability;
An analysis of the interconnection between governmental and non-
governmental use of infrastructure in Antarctica;
An identification of currently inviolate areas where semi-permanent
facilities for tourism and other non-governmental should not be
allowed
The adoption of the following Resolution:
Resolution … (2023)
Infrastructure for tourism and other non-governmental activities in
Antarctica
The Representatives,
Recalling the designation of Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted
to peace and science in Article 2 and the Environmental Principles
contained in Article 3 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection
to the Antarctic Treaty;
Also recalling that Resolution 5(2007) and Resolution 7(2009)
referred to the need to avoid that tourism activities contribute to
the long-term degradation of the Antarctic environment and values.
Noting that Resolution 5 (2022) recommended applying restrictions
on the construction and/or exploitation of facilities supporting
tourism, where its construction, operations or removal is expected
to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic
environment and values;
Desiring to take a pragmatic and precautionary approach in order
to prevent wilderness degradation in Antarctica, as agreed in
Resolution 7(2009);
Noting also the desirability of making available and accessible
updated and reliable information on the infrastructure supporting
tourism and other non-governmental activities in Antarctica, with
the aim of ensuring transparency in tourism developments and
promoting progress in Antarctic tourism governance
Recalling Resolutions 5(2007), 7(2009) and 5(2022);
Recommend to their governments:
To establish, through the Electronic Information Exchange System
(EIES), a repository of infrastructure supporting tourism and other
non-governmental activities in Antarctica, following the model
annexed to this Resolution, considering that the inclusion of any
infrastructure in this repository does not necessarily imply that this
infrastructure and/or its use is legitimized;
To request the Secretariat to produce a summarized report and a
downloadable table, based on the information provided by Parties
to the relevant section of the EIES as detailed in Decision XX
(2023), post them publicly on its website and keep them updated;
To make every effort to prevent, and not authorise, permit or
approve for the expansion of tourism and other non-governmental
activities:
new situations in which research stations allow co-use for tourism
and other non-governmental activities, as meant in category A of
the repository;
increase in size or capacity of existing permanent infrastructure for
tourism or other non-governmental activities, as meant in category
D of the repository;
the establishment of new semi-permanent and temporary
infrastructure for tourism or other non-governmental activities, as
meant in category E of the repository, in inviolate areas of
Antarctica;
That for existing situations as meant in category A of the repository,
involved governments are invited to consider setting a maximum
ratio of NAP staff/ tourists, and are encouraged to not allow further
expansion of co-use for tourism and other non-governmental
activities;
That their governments, when establishing or authorising new
facilities for logistical scientific support, clearly indicate as early as
possible in the process whether co-use for tourism and/ or other
non-governmental activities is considered appropriate and, if
applicable, to identify a limit to the level of such co-use.
