Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection
to the Antarctic Treaty
Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection
to the Antarctic Treaty
Information paper submitted by Australia, France, and Spain
Summary
This paper reports on representations conducted by Consultative
Parties, in accordance with Resolution 1 (2012) and other recent
ATCM Declarations, 2016 Santiago Declaration on the Twenty Fifth
Anniversary of the signing of the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, 2019 Prague Declaration on the
Occasion of the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty and the
2021 Paris Declaration on the occasion of the Sixtieth anniversary
of the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty and on the Thirtieth
anniversary of the signing of the 1991 Madrid Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. encouraging
States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but are not yet Party to the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (“the
Madrid Protocol”) to accede to the Protocol. While 42 of the
Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty are party to the Madrid
Protocol, including all 29 Consultative Parties, there are 14 Non-
Consultative Parties that are not yet party to the Madrid Protocol.
As 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of the Madrid Protocol’s entry
into force, Australia, France, and Spain, together with other
Consultative Parties, made representations to 13 Non-Consultative
Parties, not yet party to the Protocol. For three (3) of these 13 Non-
Consultative Parties, it was the first outreach undertaken as part of
this process. There was general support among the Parties for the
objectives and principles of the Protocol. Several Parties indicated
that they would further consider the steps required to accede,
whereas others were not yet in a position to formally respond.
Background
In accordance with Resolution 1 (2011) and Resolution 1 (2012), in
the period from 2012 to 2019, Australia, France and Spain
coordinated four rounds of outreach by Consultative Parties to
encourage States party to the Antarctic Treaty, but not yet Party to
the Madrid Protocol, to accede to it. Reports on these outreach
activities were presented in ATCM XXXV/WP31, ATCM XXXVI/
IP79, ATCM XXXVI/IP62, ATCM XLII/IP153. Since the
commencement of these outreach efforts, there have been a further
eight (8) new parties to the Madrid Protocol.
In the 2021 Paris Declaration on the occasion of the Sixtieth
anniversary of the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty and on
the Thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the 1991 Madrid Protocol
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the
Consultative Parties welcomed the increase in Parties to the Madrid
Protocol and encouraged other States that are committed to the
objectives and purposes of the Protocol to accede.
In light of the success of these previous efforts, and the declaration
made by the Consultative Parties in 2021, Australia, France and
Spain agreed to undertake a further round of outreach in 2023 to
those non-Consultative Parties that have yet to accede to the
Madrid Protocol.
Preparation and conduct of the representations in the intersessional
period
Australia, France, and Spain coordinated a fifth round of
representations in April 2023, which were undertaken with support
and participation from fifteen (15) other Consultative Parties (see
Annex 1).
Representations were made to 13 States that are a Party to the
Antarctic Treaty but have not yet acceded to the Madrid Protocol:
Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Estonia, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland,
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, San Marino, Slovakia,
and Slovenia.
These renewed efforts to encourage accessions to the Protocol were
considered to be particularly timely given that 2023 marks the 25th
anniversary of the Madrid Protocol’s entry into force.
In conducting the representations, Australia, France, and Spain
prepared a supporting aide-memoire. Supporting documentation
and information on the Madrid Protocol and steps required for
accession were also prepared and handed over, as appropriate.
Outcomes of the representations
Overall, the demarches indicated that there is support for the
objectives and principles of the Madrid Protocol among those Non-
Consultative Parties that have not yet acceded to it.
One party indicated that they had initiated discussions regarding
the possibility of accession, although no formal decision has yet
been taken.
Three of the parties expressed support for the Protocol, its
objectives and principles of environmental protection, and
undertook to consider the issue further and consult across
Government, which is likely to take some time.
One party noted that they shared the goals of the Madrid Protocol
and undertook to consider the issue further, following an
administrative reorganisation.
One party expressed that acceding to the Madrid Protocol is not a
possibility at present but undertook to continue discussion with the
competent domestic institutions on a possible approach to
accession.
One party was unable to express a clear commitment but requested
more information about upcoming meetings where the Madrid
Protocol would be discussed.
One party showed interest in the possibility of acceding to the
Madrid Protocol but noted that there are some domestic difficulties,
including an upcoming election, which make accession unlikely in
the short term.
One party, while recalling the importance they attached to the
protection of the environment, indicated that accession to the
Protocol would require extensive consultation and
interdepartmental review.
One party was not able to express a clear commitment, as it was not
able to identify the appropriate domestic authorities.
Three other parties could not provide formal responses ahead of
ATCM 45.
Australia, France, and Spain were encouraged by the support
expressed by a number of the States for the objectives and
principles of the Protocol and by the intention of some States to
give further consideration to becoming Parties to the Madrid
Protocol.
Given that not all States were able to commit to accession and/or
ratification at this time, it remains important for the Consultative
Parties to continue to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty
Parties, but not yet Party to the Madrid Protocol, to become Party
to the Protocol.
Australia, France and Spain consider that further intersessional
work, in accordance with relevant ATCM decisions and
declarations, would support:
efforts to strengthen the Antarctic Treaty system;
harmonisation of standards for the protection of the Antarctic
environment for all Antarctic Treaty Parties and their nationals;
continued growth in the community of States that have formally
demonstrated their commitment to the objective of
comprehensively protecting the Antarctic environment and
dependent and associated ecosystems and that have designated
Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science; and
the work of the Committee for Environmental Protection to provide
advice and formulate recommendations to the Parties in connection
with the implementation of the Protocol and its Annexes.
Australia, France, and Spain will continue these efforts following
ATCM 45 and encourage other Consultative Parties to do the same.
