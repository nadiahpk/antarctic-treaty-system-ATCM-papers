Plastic Pollution in the Southern Ocean
Plastic Pollution in the Southern Ocean
Information Paper submitted by SCAR
Summary
Plastic pollution has been reported in the Southern Ocean for at
least the past four decades. It is important to understand the origins
of plastics, their transport routes and their distribution in the
Southern Ocean, sub-Antarctic islands and continental Antarctica.
There is an urgent need to assess the impact of macro-, micro-, and
nanoplastics on the environment and biota, and how these interact
with other anthropogenic stressors, such as toxic chemicals,
fisheries, ocean acidification, and climate change. We highlight the
benefits of introducing standardised monitoring and impact
assessment methodologies and tools, as well as the importance of
increased global cooperation in addressing the issues of plastic
pollution in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.
Introduction
The Southern Ocean provides fundamental ecosystem services for
our planet, playing a major role in global oceanic circulation, being
responsible for 40% of the global anthropogenic carbon uptake, and
supporting fisheries for Antarctic krill and toothfish (Kennicutt et al.
2015).
Antarctica is often considered to be a “pristine” environment, but
despite significant measures in place for environmental protection,
plastic pollution has been reported from open ocean, marine and
coastal environments around the Antarctic continent and many sub-
Antarctic Islands (e.g. Waller et al. 2017; Jones-Williams et al.
2020; Caruso et al. 2022). Being well adapted to extreme but stable
environmental conditions, with unique phenotypic traits, Antarctic
species can be highly vulnerable to environmental perturbations
and chemical pollution, with plastic pollution posing a potentially
serious threat to finely balanced Southern Ocean ecosystems.
Plastic found in the Southern Ocean is likely to have originated
from both local and global sources, with new evidence that some
items may have entered the ocean at lower latitudes, crossing
perceived oceanographic barriers to reach Antarctic coasts (Rota et
al. 2022). Therefore, it is critically important that the impact of
plastic pollution on Southern Ocean ecosystems should not be
considered in isolation but set in a global context. It is widely
accepted that scientific research needs to address this issue in a
transdisciplinary manner, encompassing knowledge and
competencies from both global and regional experts. Understanding
the interconnection between the various anthropogenic impacts
(including climate change) affecting the Antarctic must be
considered a priority in order to properly assess the impact of
plastic pollution.
The SCAR Plastic in Polar Environments Action Group
The SCAR Plastic in Polar Environments Action Group (Plastic-AG)
was established in June 2018 in order to connect researchers from
around the globe with an interest in plastic pollution in Polar
regions. The key aims of the Plastic-AG are to collate information,
establish baselines, understand the impacts of plastic pollution,
establish standardised procedures for sampling and monitoring, and
propose new measures to reduce and/or limit any potential
negative impacts on Polar Environments.
Key milestones to date include:
launch of the PLASTIC-AG at a side meeting at SCAR POLAR 2018
in Davos, Switzerland;
collation of open access data for all plastic pollution records in the
Southern Ocean, from published literature (up to 2016) hosted by
the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) http://
www.soosmap.aq/;
an International workshop on “Plastic in the Polar Environment:
sources, impacts and solutions” in 2019 at the University of Hull,
UK;
the publication of a special issue of the journal Environment
International (Elsevier) in 2020 entitled: “Plastics in Polar Regions”;
a session on “Plastic in the Southern Ocean” during the XXXI SETAC
Europe Annual Meeting in 2021;
a Satellite Activity under the umbrella of the UN Ocean Decade on
“Plastic pollution in the Southern Ocean: a global outlook” in 2022;
the establishment of a Plastic-AG Early Career researcher network
to share upcoming events and opportunities;
the establishment of the first open access polar plastics repository
summarising national and international projects dealing with plastic
pollution in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions (https://
www.scar.org/scar-news/plastic-news/project-repository/).
Types of plastic pollution in the Southern Ocean
Macroplastics (defined as > 5 mm) were first observed in the
Southern Ocean in the 1970s with reports of seals entangled in
marine debris (Bonner and McCann 1982) and the ingestion of
plastics by seabirds (Van Franeker and Bell 1988). Microplastics (1
µm-5 mm) were first reported by Thompson et al. (2004), but not
recorded in the Southern Ocean until 2009, when particles were
identified in intertidal sediments from South Georgia Island (Barnes
et al. 2009). Since then, microplastics have been reported in
shallow waters (<50 m depth) at a number of locations around the
Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia; in deep sea sediments of the
Weddell Sea; in East Antarctic sea ice and in circumpolar surface
waters (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Waller et al. 2017; Kelly et
al. 2020; Suaria et al. 2020).
Nanoplastics (< 1 µm) are the most recently reported type of
plastic in Antarctica, with a single record from a sea ice core from
Cape Evans, Ross Island (Materić et al. 2022). As such, nanoplastics
may originate from sources such as emissions from atmospheric and
marine transport, (re)emission, deposition and ice incorporation,
however both their environmental occurrence and distribution are
still in the very early stages of evaluation.
Impact of plastic pollution on Southern Ocean ecosystems
The presence of macroplastics on shorelines and in association with
seabirds (Waluda et al. 2020; Phillips and Waluda 2020), and their
impacts on marine species including entanglement (Waluda and
Staniland 2013) have been monitored by the Commission for the
Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) since 1989
(https://www.ccamlr.org/en/science/marine-debris). In addition,
CCAMLR has implemented measures to reduce the amount of debris
entering the marine system and to mitigate its impact in Antarctica.
While microplastic pollution is recognised by CCAMLR as an
emerging threat, it is not currently part of its routine monitoring
programme.
Microplastics have been shown to be present in terrestrial
collembola, marine invertebrates, fish and air-breathing predators
such as penguins and seals (Caruso et al. 2022), however neither
sources nor transfer mechanisms through the Antarctic food webs
have yet been clearly described. It is likely that the unique and
extreme environment of the Southern Ocean (high levels of
ultraviolet irradiance in summer, wave action, ice scour and low
temperatures) may contribute to the rapid breakdown of
macroplastics into micro- and nanoplastics, increasing their
bioavailability and potential risk to Antarctic species and
ecosystems.
Recent findings show how sea-ice-associated species, such as
Antarctic krill could play a role in the fragmentation of
microplastics down to nanoscale dimensions, increasing the
probability of exposure through marine food webs (Dawson et al.
2018). Due to their size and high surface
reactivity, nanoplastics can easily cross biological barriers with
resulting adverse toxicological effects. Cellular uptake and
disruption to the immune response of some Antarctic benthic
grazers (sea urchins) and changes in swimming and moulting of
Antarctic krill have only recently been reported (Bergami et al.
2019; Bergami et al. 2020).
Plastic pollution and multiple stressors on Southern Ocean
ecosystems
Addressing the potential impact of plastic pollution in isolation does
not allow us to fully predict consequences in years to come. It is
critical to account for potential cumulative effects with other
stressors, and efforts should be made to implement a holistic and
interdisciplinary approach to studying plastic pollution in the
Southern Ocean.
The interactions between climate change and micro- and
nanoplastics are likely to magnify the potential for interactions with
other toxicants, as well as lead to an enhanced susceptibility of
Antarctic species to these stressors. A particular focus on keystone
species, such as Antarctic krill, which support Southern Ocean
ecosystems, is required in order to understand realistic plastic
toxicity thresholds and potential trophic cascade impacts through
the pelagic food web. Some impacts of multiple stressors have
already been shown, with the development of Antarctic krill
embryos being lowest under a scenario where nanoplastic exposure
is coupled with ocean acidification (Rowlands et al. 2021).
Nevertheless, expanding the scope of studies from single to multiple
stressors is challenging, requiring a combination of empirical,
experimental, and modelling approaches.
Improving understanding of plastic pollution in the Southern Ocean
The challenge of understanding the impact of plastic pollution in
Antarctica is compounded by the difficulty in collecting samples
and data, due to the remote location and inaccessibility of many
study areas and species. For this reason, it is crucial to develop a
common set of actions and strategies for consistent and replicable
data collection and to establish standard procedures for monitoring
the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. This will also enable scientists
to increase spatial and temporal data coverage in order to improve
our understanding of the fate and behaviour of plastics and their
effects. This will require a joint effort from all stakeholders
operating in the Southern Ocean and in adjacent regions, as well as
knowledge and information exchange between scientists, industry,
environmental agencies and conservation and management bodies.
ATCM Resolution 5 (2019) on Reducing Plastic Pollution in
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean noted that there is a current
lack of plastics monitoring data to inform decision-making and
recommended the support of greater monitoring of plastic pollution
in Antarctica using developing standards and comparative
methodologies, particularly near areas of human activity. The
Resolution further invited SCAR to report as new information
emerges that quantifies plastic pollution and details the risks to
Antarctic species and communities.
The CEP has also identified specific science needs regarding plastic
pollution, including:
Assess the impact of plastic pollution on natural systems under
“multiple stressors” scenarios.
Determine sources and transport routes of plastic pollution in
Antarctic marine and terrestrial environments.
To support these aims and science needs, SCAR recommends that
further research should be focussed on the following priorities:
Evaluating the extent of plastic pollution in the Southern Ocean.
This includes assessing the distribution and concentration of plastics
generated from both within and outside the Southern Ocean, and
defining their behaviour across food webs as well as their response
to specific environmental conditions. The PLASTIC-AG will continue
its mission to increase awareness of the importance of studying
plastic pollution in the Southern Ocean, and encourages the
participation of additional nations and scientific research institutes
operating in Antarctica in future meetings and scientific
publications.
Improving our understanding of current and future effects of plastic
pollution on Southern Ocean biota and ecosystems. This can be
achieved by identifying critical hotspots of cumulative impact of
plastic with other toxic chemicals, determining individual and
additive toxicity thresholds, and identifying biological and genetic
adaptation strategies that may provide resilience to the impact.
Furthermore, it is important to set plastic pollution in the context of
climate change by taking into account the interaction between
plastic pollution and multiple stressors. The PLASTIC-AG has also
established an ongoing collaboration with the SCAR Input Pathways
of Persistent Organic Pollutants to Antarctica (IMPACT-AG), with
the aim of progressing common objectives.
Providing the research evidence needed to underpin effective global
co-operation to build a common framework for developing an
Antarctic “plastic footprint” action plan. The PLASTIC-AG has
already instigated a number of activities including the Plastics at
the Poles workshop and Ocean Decade satellite event, with more to
come in the next 2 years.
Consolidating information on plastic-related activities and
initiatives from different nations operating in Antarctica. The
PLASTIC-AG has made published locations of plastic pollution
available via SOOSmap (http://www.soosmap.aq/) and is leading
the generation of an Antarctic plastics repository along with a user-
friendly map displaying current project locations. This will be made
freely available at: https://www.scar.org/science/plastic/home/.
