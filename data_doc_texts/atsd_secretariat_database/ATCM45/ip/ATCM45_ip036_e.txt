Summary
Since its foundation in 2012, Polar Educators International (PEI)
has grown into a network for polar education practice. To date,
more than 3000 PEI members from 43 countries have collaborated
with researchers to share their polar knowledge and expertise,
connecting polar education, research and the global community.
The PEI Executive Committee and Council provide a leadership
platform for polar scientists and educators who are passionate about
promoting the educational value of Antarctica and Antarctic
research (in its widest aspects) to many diverse sectors of society.
PEI has the support from various organisations (including formal
endorsements from SCAR, IASC, ARCUS, APECS) engaged in
numerous educational activities (e.g. “Polar Resource Book”, PEI
international Workshops, polar science/educational projects). PEI
advocates polar literacy and environmental stewardship for
international processes and aims to continue fostering international
cooperation of teachers around the world on polar education.
Introduction
Education and outreach on the value and importance of Antarctic
science with the governance objectives of the Antarctic Treaty are
imperative. Teachers and educators can provide a crucial link in
transferring knowledge from the scientific community both to the
academic community and the general public.  Education is now a
regular agenda item for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings
(ATCM) since 2015, with considerable effort from Parties,
Observers and Experts who engaged in the Workshop on education
and outreach at the ATCM in Bulgaria (2015; ATCM XXXVII/
WP009), followed by the establishment of an Intersessional Contact
Group on Education and Outreach that has demonstrated an
increased interest in education and outreach activities within ATCM
(ATCM XXXIX/WP24, ATCM XL/WP24, ATCM XLII/WP33, ATCM
XLIII/WP15, ATCM XLIV/WP23). This report aims to review the
work carried out by PEI since its creation in 2012, following the
previous report of its work (e.g. ATCM XXXVII/IP2; ATCM XLII/
IP95; ATCM XLIII/IP32). 
The mission and objectives of Polar Educators International 
PEI is a professional network for polar educators, created at the
International Polar Year 2007-08 (IPY) conference in 2012
(Montreal, Canada). The ongoing legacy of IPY Education Outreach
and Communication is most clearly evidenced in the ongoing
activities and process of maturation of APECS, PYRN and PEI
(Hindshaw et al. 2018, Tanski et al. 2019, Roop et al. 2019). PEI is
an essential network of educators and researchers with a mission to
connect polar education, research and the global community by
collaborating to provide a broad audience with a deeper
understanding of current polar sciences and the polar regions.
Members of this international network demonstrate respect for
diverse cultures and uphold the PEI core values of being welcoming,
credible, passionate and dedicated, engaging diverse audiences in
understanding the polar regions and their connection to all earth’s
systems. PEI believes strongly that children and young people have
the right to education, and strives to actively welcome all learners
equally, addressing the needs of hard-to-reach audiences, and
supporting the needs of individuals and communities discriminated
against on the basis of their gender, sexual orientation, age, culture,
beliefs, disabilities, or social and economic situation.
PEI similarly does not discriminate against its members on the same
basis, supporting actions on equity, diversity and inclusion.   
PEI has formal endorsement from the Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the International Arctic Science
Council (IASC), and a close partnership with the Association of
Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) and the Arctic Research
Consortium of the United States (ARCUS). Less formal partnerships
include Students on Ice (SOI), PolarTREC and INTERACT. PEI has
many members and partners that are involved in Antarctic Treaty
countries. Currently PEI has over 3000 members from 43 countries,
24 of which are Antarctic Treaty Contracting Parties (Argentina,
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, France,
Germany, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, The Netherlands,
Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, United
Kingdom, Uruguay, and the United States of America). 
Now celebrating over ten years of activity (since ATCM 15 IP 002
10/03/2014), PEI has grown in visibility and importance through
its activities including Six international conferences and educator
workshops (Coimbra, Portugal; Hanover, Germany; Rovereto, Italy;
Cambridge, UK; Höfn, Iceland), PEI Master Classes for polar
educators (led by science-education partnerships) both available via
the PEI website https: //polareducator.org/), multiple PEI papers
delivered by active members at international polar science
conferences (e.g. AGU, ASSW, EGU and SCAR Open Science
Meetings), Policy level representation (COP26, Glasgow (press
conference “Polar Education and Climate Change”, Pre-COP, Milan,
Italy, September 2021, Arctic Science Ministerial Meeting (ASM3),
and currently, the ICARP IV process). With the urgent need to
inform the next generation of leaders and engage them in positive
action to mitigate anthropogenic climate forcing, the goal is to take
education and science communication ‘UPSTREAM’ in the polar
research process (see https://youtu.be/Gtf0sqShkZs), sharing
important research more directly, in accessible formats, exactly
where it is needed. Members connect and interact via PEI social
media platforms (FaceBook, Instagram and Twitter) and in person
at polar education workshops. As an example, between 2020-2022,
throughout the COVID pandemic, 17 volunteer PEI Council
members reached out to over 11,000 adults and 4500 young people
through 45 online activities focused specifically on the polar
regions, and provided a crucial international support network for
teachers.
PEI is highly involved in updating the IPY publication Polar Science
and Global Climate: An International Resource for Education and
Outreach (Kaiser et al. 2010), known as the “Polar Resource Book”
(PRB). Currently a collaboration with APECS, SCAR and IASC, the
aim is to create a professional, co-produced, open access resource to
connect, inspire and support educators, science communicators,
students and emerging polar researchers with a shared commitment
to outreach and education. There are plans to expand the network
of contributing partners, in preparation for IPY 2032-2033.  
Future plans
Following the legacy of the last IPY, when many Contracting Parties
carried out numerous education initiatives (ATCM 15 IP 002
10/03/2014), PEI continues to advocate for the inclusion of
education at all levels as a fundamental part of planning for the
future of the Antarctic in the lead up to IPY 2032-33 and engage
ATCMs in discussion of potential future objectives for education and
outreach, based on the urgent need of polar educators and the
wider polar community. PEI shares the goal of a society that is
informed about important global issues and the role that Antarctica
plays in life-supporting Earth Systems (Xavier et al. 2019a, b),
connecting polar education, science and communities through
collaboration (PRB project), advocacy (SCAR CBET (Capacity
Building, Education and Training), ASSW and ICARP IV), and
regular, international, educator-led initiatives (PEI2025-Boulder,
Colorado).
