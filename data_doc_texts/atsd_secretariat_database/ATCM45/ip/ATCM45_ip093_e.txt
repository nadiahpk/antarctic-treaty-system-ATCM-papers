Antarctica 2300 (ISMIP6) Projections
Antarctica 2300 (ISMIP6) projections
Summary
The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (ISMIP6, Nowicki et
al., 2016) is a crucial part of the World Climate Research
Programme’s Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
(CMIP6), which focuses on ice sheets. The goal of ISMIP6 is to
provide processed-based projections of ice sheet contribution to sea-
level rise for the 21st century (Nowicki et al., 2020; Goelzer et al.,
2020; Seroussi et al., 2020), and to assess the uncertainties
associated with these projections and their origins. It is also
essential to consider ice sheet projections beyond the 21st century,
as instability mechanisms have the potential to rapidly destabilize
ice sheets, and several regions may reach tipping points, potentially
leading to much larger sea level contributions. ISMIP6 Antarctica
2300 Projections is a continuation of the successful ISMIP6 project,
and extends previous simulations to 2300, using climate forcings
from both CMIP5 and CMIP6 under different scenarios.
Protocol and experiments
Fourteen experiments are forced with evolving climate conditions
from Global Climate Models (GCMs). These experiments are based
on 5 different CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs and most are based on a
high carbon emission scenario (RCP 8.5 and SSP5-8.5). The
majority of experiments are forced with climate conditions
(atmospheric and oceanic conditions) simulated by GCMs until
2300, but a few simulations are based on repeated forcings from the
end of the 21st century. In this case, conditions from 2080 to 2100
are repeated for the following two century. In order to avoid
repeating the same interannual patterns, annual conditions are
selected randomly from the 2080-2100 period to create forcing for
the entire length of the experiments. The same selection is used by
all ice flow models to ensure they are forced with similar
conditions. Additionally, two experiments use a low carbon
emission scenario (RC P2.6 or SSP1-2.6) and four experiments
introduce ice shelf collapse that happens when ice shelves
experience elevated amounts of liquid water at their surface for a
period of ten years or more (Trusel et al., 2015).
Similar to the philosophy adopted for initMIP-Antarctica (Seroussi
et al., 2019) and ISMIP6 Antarctica projections (Seroussi et al.,
2020), there are no constraints on the method or datasets used to
initialize ice sheet models. The exact initialization date is also left
to the discretion of individual modeling groups, so the historical
experiment length varies among groups (some groups start directly
at the beginning of 2015 and therefore did not submit a historical
run). The resulting ensemble includes a variety of model
resolutions, stress balance approximations, and initialization
methods, representative of the diversity of the ice sheet modeling
community for more details on participating models. 16
international groups submitted experiments using 13 different ice
flow models, resulting in a total of 45 sets of experiments.
Antarctic contribution to sea level rise
ISMIP6 Antarctica 2300 Projections results show a contribution to
sea level rise by 2100 consistent with previous ISMIP6 efforts
despite the ensemble of models being slightly different from the one
in Seroussi et al. (2020). The Antarctic ice loss and its contribution
to sea level increases rapidly after 2100 to reach up to 4.2 meters of
global mean sea level rise by 2300 (see Fig.1). However, some
simulations suggest a mass gain that continues beyond the 21st
century, leading to an overall sea level fall of up to 0.8 meters by
2300. Simulations forced by CCSM4 cause the least amount of mass
loss, due to the increased snow precipitations in East Antarctica,
while simulations forced with CESM2, HadGEM and UKESM suggest
relatively similar amounts of sea level change. Additional
experiments (not shown) performed with repeated forcings from
the end of the 21st century show significantly less sea level
contribution, up to 1 meter less sea level rise, while experiments
including ice shelf collapse show a notable increase in sea level rise
contribution, up to 1 additional meter sea level rise by 2300 for the
most extreme cases.

conditions from CCSM4 (blue), HadGEM (red), CESM2 (yellow) and
UKESM (green) until 2300. No ice shelf collapse is included in these
experiments. Adapted from Seroussi et al. (in prep.)
Our results demonstrate the large uncertainty coming from both ice
flow models as well forcings from climate models (Barthel et al.,
2020). They suggest that continued development and improvements
are needed to both enhance the reliability of ice flow models, as
well as to provide accurate projections of climate evolution in polar
regions in the 21st century and beyond.
In conclusion it is essential for all Treaty Parties to consider ice
sheet projections beyond the 21st century, as instability
mechanisms have the potential to rapidly destabilize ice sheets, and
several regions may reach tipping points, potentially leading to
much larger sea level contributions and a commitment to multi-
meter (intergenerational) sea-level rise.
Membership
The ISMIP6 consist of ice flow modelers as well as physical
oceanographers, atmospheric scientist, climate modelers, and data
scientist from 11 countries over 4 continents. We welcome new
members and would be happy to extend the involvement of this
initiative to other interested groups worldwide.
