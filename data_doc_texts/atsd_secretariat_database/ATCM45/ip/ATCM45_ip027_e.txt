The retrospective modeling as an approach to cumulative impacts
assessment due to operation of scientific stations in the Antarctic
Information paper submitted by the Republic of Belarus
Cumulative impacts onto Antarctic environment belong to less
methodologically worked out among the impacts, which should be
assessed according to the Protocol on Environmental Protection.
The Information Paper is intended to draw attention to supplement
to the progress on this issue.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, construction of the first
stations in Antarctica began. This process accelerated during the
International Geophysical Year (1957/1958) and since then, it is
believed (Tin et al., 2009) that the intensity and scale of human
activity in Antarctica have continued to grow. But quantitative
assessment of trends of levels of anthropogenic impacts due to
operation of Antarctic stations on the environment are still limited.
The atmospheric impact modeling was started on the example of
the Vecherny Oasis (eastern part of the Thala Hills) for the period
from 1985 to 2015 was continued for a larger area and for a longer
period with higher temporal resolution (Kakareka and Salivonchyk,
2022).
The article is devoted to the assessment of trends of atmospheric air
pollution and atmospheric impacts on the environment in the oases
of the Thala Hills, Enderby Land, East Antarctica. Estimates of
annual emission of SO2, NOx, PM10 and CO and their dynamics
over 56 years of Thala Hills exploration are given, as well as levels
of surface concentrations of SO2, NOx, PM10 and PM10
atmospheric deposition using air dispersion modeling. It is shown,
in particular, that average annual emissions of NOx, PM10 and CO
peaked in the early 1990s and have decreased 30.9 times by now.
Sulfur dioxide emissions were highest in the late 1960s – late
1970s, and decreased 270 times.
Results of comparison of modeled air concentrations and
depositions with the available data on measurement of air surface
pollutant concentrations and atmospheric depositions are presented.
Sources of uncertainties in the estimates of emissions, ground-level
concentrations and depositions are described.
Proposed approaches can be used to assess the cumulative impacts
of ongoing and planned activities on atmospheric air and on other
components of the environment through the atmospheric air in the
Antarctic Treaty area.
