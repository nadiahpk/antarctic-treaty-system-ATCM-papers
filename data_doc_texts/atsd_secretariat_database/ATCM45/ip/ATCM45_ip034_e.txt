Summary
This paper evaluates the key topics and their target audiences
mentioned by the Parties, Observers and Experts in their ATCM
papers that relate to education and outreach. Since the Antarctic
Treaty entered into force in 1961, a total of 200 ATCM papers on
education and outreach have been produced. The number of papers
has increased since the 1990s, during which time the Protocol on
Environmental Protection entered into force. The topics addressed
most in the ATCM papers were “science” and “wildlife/biodiversity/
environment”. The target audience for most of the reported
education and outreach activities were the general public and those
attending schools and Universities. Since the first workshop on
education and outreach in 2015, and the subsequent establishment
of the ATCM Intersessional Contact Group on Education and
Outreach, the number of ATCM papers on education and outreach
has increased, as has the level of information sharing by Parties. We
encourage further work on education and outreach, including
through the ATCM Intersessional Contact Group on Education and
Outreach.
Background
Education and outreach has been an element of the ATCM and CEP
multi-year strategic work plans since 2015. This was due to the
workshop on education and outreach at ATCMXXXVIII in Bulgaria
(2015) that aimed to provide greater visibility of Parties’ public
education and outreach activities (ATCM XXXVII/WP009). Thirty-
seven Parties, Observers and Experts (ATCM XXXVIII/BP26, report
ATCM XXXVIII Paragraph 323) attended the workshop, whose
outcome was the establishment of an Intersessional Contact Group
on Education and Outreach that has subsequently demonstrated an
increased interest and active engagement in education and outreach
activities by ATCM Parties, Observers and Experts (ATCM XXXIX/
WP24, ATCM XL/WP24, ATCMXLII/WP33, ATCMXLIII/WP15,
ATCMXLIV/WP23). While the increasing trend in the number of
ATCM papers has been described previously (ATCM XLIII/IP32)
(Xavier et al. 2019), this paper aims to provide an overview of the
key topics mentioned in the ATCM papers and their target
audiences.
Growth in the number of papers on Education and Outreach in
relation to their topics and target audience
A search for the words “education” and/or “outreach”, as well as
papers within the category “Educational Issues”, at the documents
page of the Antarctic Treaty System (http://www.ats.aq), between
1961 and 2022 (noting that there was no ATCM in 2020) was
carried out. For each ATCM paper, key topics (i.e. “cooperation”,
“wildlife/biodiversity/environment”, “science”, “climate change”,
“ATS/Protocol legislation”; “Equity, Diversity and Inclusion”) and
audiences (“Policy makers”, “Antarctic personnel”, “Artists”,
“Journalists”, “Public”, “Schools (inc. Universities)”), and references
to the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) and
Polar Educators International (PEI), were identified.
A total of 200 ATCM papers were submitted to ATCMs between
1961 and 2022 (Figure 1) that related to education and outreach.
Up until the 1990s, most delegations considered education and
outreach a low priority. With the implementation of the Protocol on
Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1998) and the establishment of
the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach
(2015), there has been an increasing number of ATCM papers on
the topic of education and outreach (Figure 1). Indeed, the number
of papers submitted during 2021 and 2022 almost reaching the
same number submitted to ATCMs during the period 2010-2014.
The peak in number of ATCM papers on the topic during the period
2015-2019 is attributed to the education and outreach workshop
held at ATCMXXXVIII in Bulgaria and subsequent submissions in
the years thereafter.
Figure 1. Number of papers submitted to the Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meetings between 1961 and 2022 (grouped by 5-year
clusters; e.g. 1960 = 1960–1964). Data obtained from a search on
“education” and/or “outreach”, and within the category
“Educational issues” at the documents page of the Antarctic Treaty
System website (http://www.ats.aq/) (following Xavier et al. 2019).
Note: the data for “2020” (in red) includes only data for 2021 and
2022 (whereas all other clusters include 5 years of data).
Over half (54%) of Parties, Observers and Experts published at least
one ATCM paper on education or outreach, which included 83% of
the Consultative Parties, 31% of the non-Consultative Parties, 100%
of Observers and 31% of Experts (see Appendix 1). Those Parties
that produced the most ATCM papers were Chile (21%), the United
Kingdom (10.5%), Bulgaria (9.5%), Brazil (9.0%), Portugal (9.0%)
and Belgium (7.5%). The topic most commonly addressed in the
ATCM papers was “science” (75.5%) and “wildlife/biodiversity/
environment” (74.0%). Only 57% of the ATCM papers aimed to
provide information concerning “ATS/protocol legislation” (Table
1). “Equity, Diversity and Inclusion” seemed to be little addressed,
being mentioned in only 2% of all ATCM papers.
In terms of targeted audiences, most ATCM papers included
activities directed to the “public” (80.0%) and to schools, including
Universities (68.5%). When comparing the periods 1961-2014 (pre-
establishment of the ICG on Education and Outreach) and
2015-2022 (post-establishment of the ICG on Education and
Outreach), ATCM papers on education and outreach focused more
on “research” (+16.5%), “ATS/protocol legislation” (+ 11.0%) ,
“cooperation” (+8.5%) and “climate change” (+8.0%) in the later
period (Table 1). APECS (+10.5%) and PEI (+4.5%) were also
mentioned more in the later period as organizations did not exist
until recently (I.e. APECS was founded in 2007 and PEI in 2012)
(Table 1).
The importance of sharing information related to education and
outreach is now recognized by most ATCM Parties, Observers and
Experts, as illustrated in the ATCM/CEP multi-year strategic work
plans. The number of papers submitted to the ATCM on education
and outreach
has greatly increased, particularly in recent years, due to the
increased priority given to these issues by Parties and by the
contribution of the ATCM ICG on Education and Outreach.

We continue to encourage Parties, Observers and Experts to
organize, disseminate and collaborate nationally and internationally
in education and outreach initiatives related to the Antarctic Treaty,
following the Antarctic spirit of cooperation. Future ATCM papers
address new relevant topics (e.g., “Equity, Diversity and Inclusion”)
with the engagement of the next generations of scientists (via
APECS) and educators (via PEI).
