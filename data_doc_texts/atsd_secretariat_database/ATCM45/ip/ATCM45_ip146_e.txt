Revitalization of the A. B. Dobrowolski Polish Antarctic Station

Revitalization of the A. B. Dobrowolski Polish Antarctic Station
(Bunger Hills, East Antarctica)
Summary
As part of the agreement on research cooperation between the
Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (IG PAS) and
the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), four
Polish scientists joined the 67th Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE)
in the summer season 2021/2022 (see also ATCM40_bp005-e,
ATCM43_ip087-e). The group has visited the Dobrowolski Station
(Poland) in the Bunger Hills, East Antarctica.
The members of the Polish expedition have inspected the condition
of the infrastructure of the Dobrowolski Station after 42 years of
non-use. Two accommodation huts and two measurement huts were
cleaned up and new furnishings and equipment were installed. The
expedition members conducted a reconnaissance geoscience
program that included environmental studies, geological fieldwork
in multiple sites and seismological, magnetic, meteorological and
ionospheric measurements at the Station. Debris and rubbish from
the huts and the surrounding area was removed and transported to
Cape Town for disposal. Historical artefacts, found in the huts and
nearby, were preserved and transported to Poland. The Station was
left clean and in good order, ready to serve as a summer base for
future expeditions. Future plans include installing an automatic and
autonomic magnetometer and seismometer, and continuing
research programs into geomorphology, geology and environmental
remediation. Details of the Polish expedition’s activities at the
Dobrowolski Station were presented at the SCAR conference in
India (2022). The presentation is available online
