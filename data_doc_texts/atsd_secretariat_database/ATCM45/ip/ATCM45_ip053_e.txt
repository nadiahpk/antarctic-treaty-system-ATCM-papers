A Five-Year Overview and 2022-23 Season Report on IAATO
Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM
Visitor Site Guidelines
Information Paper submitted by IAATO
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM
information on IAATO Operator Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines use. This information paper presents data collected by
IAATO from IAATO Operator Post Visit Report Forms for the
Antarctic Peninsula during the 2022-23 season. Visits by non-
IAATO members are not included in this analysis.
In addition to our annual data sets, building on discussions with
different Antarctic Treaty Parties around growth, we have included
some historical data which may aid in future discussions around site
usage and management.
Due to the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, data sets from the
2020-21 season have been excluded to provide a more
representative overview of the statistics.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found
in ATCM XLV IP56 IAATO Vessel Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2022-23 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24 Season, and
on the IAATO website https://iaato.org/information-resources/
data-statistics/.
Historic Overview of Antarctic Peninsula Traditional Seaborne
Tourism
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional
commercial seaborne (SOLAS Vessel) tourism in the Antarctic
Peninsula, which accounts for over 95% of all landed activity.
A SOLAS vessel is any ship to which the International Convention
for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 applies; namely: a passenger ship
engaged on an international voyage, or a non-passenger ship of 500
tons gross tonnage or more engaged on an international voyage.
Yacht (vessels carrying 12 passengers or less) numbers are only
included where specifically mentioned.
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different
aspects of traditional commercial seabourne tourism (number of
passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used).
Figure 1: Factor Change in Traditional Landing Ship-borne Tourism
in the Antarctic Peninsula 1989–2022.
During the 2022-23, season all traditional commercial seaborne
tourism with landings around the Peninsula was conducted by
IAATO Operators. Table 1 provides a detailed summary of number
of passengers, voyages, landings, sites and vessels over the past five
seasons. It shows the industry growth over the period 2017-2022,
and potential number of passengers and voyages for 2023-24.

voyages, landings, sites and SOLAS vessels on the Antarctic
Peninsula for the past five years, 2017–2022, and potential number
of passengers, vessels and voyages for 2023/24. Passenger data
presented in Table 1 includes IAATO operated Yachts.

Since IMO’s International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters
(Polar Code) was adopted, there has been substantial investment by
operators in existing and new build vessels. The 2019-20 season
saw the first new SOLAS vessels launched after the Polar Code came
into force in January 2017
Some new vessels scheduled for the 2021-22 season were delayed
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and some Operators did not
operate all their vessels. The 2022/23 season saw the launch of
these delayed vessels.
Operators saw fewer clients willing to travel during the 2021-22
season due to COVID-19 and therefore had lower occupancy, as
well as truncating their season with the emergence of the Omicron
variant.
As new vessels are introduced into the IAATO fleet, the average
passenger capacity per vessel has increased. For example, relatively
more Category 1 vessels being added now operate at their upper
limit capacity 200 passengers.
Analysis of site use and activities (found in ATCM XLIV IP56 IAATO
Vessel Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2022-23 Season and
Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24 Season) has shown Operators are
responding to IAATO’s multi layered strategy to encourage them to
spread activities across a range of platforms: ship cruising; small
boat cruising; kayaking; etc., in order to reduce activity at landing
sites. IAATO has encouraged this practice since 2012 and
strengthened it during our 2019 Annual Meeting by incorporating
into our Bylaws a new Code of Conduct for Vessels.
Specific Landing Site Use for the 2022/23 season
The top five visitor sites for the 2022-23 season were Cuverville
Island, Neko Harbour, Damoy Point/Dorian Bay, Whalers Bay and
Portal Point. These sites account for approximately 25% of all
landings made during the season. The top twenty most-visited sites
accounted for approximately 65% of all landings.
Appendix I lists the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made
from 2017–2022
Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative number of landings made per
day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula over a five-year
period (2017–2022). During the 2022-23 season, landings occurred
in the Antarctic Treaty area over a period of approximately 160
days from 24 October to 01 April.
Figure 2: Cumulative number of landings made per day at all sites
within the Antarctic Peninsula 2017–2022.
There is variation in levels of activity. These peaks and troughs are
remarkably similar from season to season, and demonstrate the
fluctuations in levels of visitation, resulting from schedules for
expeditions revolving around holiday season timetables.
Factors such as ice patterns and weather strongly contribute to site
selection and visitation patterns by either allowing or restricting
access. Additionally, during the 2022-23 season, site selection was
also focused on the enhanced biosecurity procedures for Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), and sites such as Portal Point
and Damoy Point/Dorian Bay received higher visitation due to open
space away from wildlife.
Additional tourism statistics are available on the IAATO website:
https://iaato.org/information-resources/data-statistics/.
Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines
Appendix II provides a five-year analysis (2017-2022) of active
seasons (2020-21 excluded) of the total number of known landings
made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines. An
assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines was conducted through an analysis of the ATCM Post
Visit Report Forms for traditional commercial ship-borne and yacht
tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula.
Use of IAATO Visitor Site Guidelines
In addition to ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, IAATO Operators are
bound to follow IAATO Visitor Site Guidelines, which have been put
into effect to further assist in site management where ATCM Site
Guidelines are not in place yet. The sites can be either terrestrial or
marine based, and the criteria by which they are created includes:
sites which are visited often, have particular values to be protected,
and/or need particular guidance for safety or environmental
reasons. IAATO continues to update and enhance guidelines and
operational procedures as appropriate.
Appendix III provides a list of visitor sites covered by IAATO Visitor
Site Guidelines. IAATO welcomes collaboration with Parties on the
development of new site guidelines, and reviewing any of the
existing IAATO site specific guidelines.
Conclusion
The information extracted from these ATCM Post Visit Report forms
for traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic
Peninsula shows that while overall tourism levels continued to rise
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase is not uniform across
all visitor sites as demonstrated in Appendix II. A few sites continue
to prove very popular with a greater increase in activity, while
some other sites saw a decrease in activity. The pattern of
concentrated increase is believed to be partially explained by the
popularity of these sites for their reliable access, ease of visitor
management, and aesthetic value and historic interest. Additionally,
factors such as ice patterns and weather strongly contribute to site
selection and visitation patterns by either allowing or restricting
access.
All of the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by
ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Antarctic
Program Management guidelines.
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP
and ATCM on its Operators’ activities. In addition, IAATO Operators
remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of
ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
