Seismic activity and associated risk in Antarctica
Seismic activity and associated risk in Antarctica
Information paper submitted by SCAR
Summary
In 2021, ATCM Resolution 7 invited SCAR to provide a report on
seismic activity in Antarctica, recognising the risks of seismic and
volcanic activity for people and infrastructure, and the need to
undertake monitoring and research on seismic activity and the risks
associated with a high-magnitude seismic or volcanic event. This
paper provides information on the causes and locations of seismic
activity in Antarctica, and associated seismic hazard. It also
provides an inventory of seismic stations which locate and record
seismic activity, and recommends ongoing support for seismic
monitoring and research. SCAR will continue to work with The
Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP)
towards further assessment of seismic risk near Antarctic stations,
noting that priority should be given to the northern Antarctic
Peninsula, Bransfield Strait, South Shetland Islands and South
Orkney Islands, as well as other regions with seismic clusters such
as Victoria Land, Ross Island, Queen Mary Land and Adélie Land.
Background
Antarctica is mostly a seismically quiet continent surrounded by
oceans. Compared to other parts of the world, seismic activity in
Antarctica is generally low (Kaminuma, 1976; Reading, 2007;
Kanao, 2014). The thick ice sheet inhibits most earthquakes on the
Antarctic continent (Johnston, 1987), although glacial isostatic
adjustment resulting from ice loss favours glacial seismotectonic
activity (Muir-Wood, 2000; Turpeinen et al., 2008). Most seismic
activity in Antarctica is caused by tectonic movements near plate
boundaries located in the Southern Ocean although intraplate
activity has also been observed (Lough et al., 2018). Active plate
boundaries are found near the Antarctic Peninsula, including the
boundaries between the Antarctic, South American, Scotia, and
Sandwich plates. Victoria Land also experiences significant seismic
activity. The largest earthquake ever recorded in or around
Antarctica, with a magnitude of Mw 8.1, occurred in the Southern
Ocean near the Balleny Islands in 1998 (Nettles et al., 1999;
Himeno et al., 2011). Additionally, seismic activity is related to
glacial isostatic adjustment and cryoseismicity, mainly in local areas
near coasts. The seismic activity related to volcanoes is local but
also significant, such as at Mount Erebus (Kaminuma, 1987; Rowe
et al., 1998, 2000; Konstantinou et al., 2019) and Deception Island
(Carmona et al., 2012; Jimenez-Morales et al., 2017, 2022; Moreno-
Vacas and Almendros, 2021).
Seismic hazard is a function of the magnitude and depth of seismic
activity and the geological structure that determines the peak and
spectral ground motion parameters in addition to earthquake
recurrence. Seismic risk depends on seismic hazard and in addition
it is influenced by other factors such as population density, location
and infrastructure vulnerability, and other processes associated with
seismic events, such as landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. It is
crucial to assess ground shaking and related geohazards to prepare
for worst-case scenarios and take measures to reduce vulnerability
to seismic events.
Location of seismic stations in Antarctica
Seismic stations are essential for the location and characterisation
of seismic activity in Antarctica. Although stations situated far from
the study area around the world can still record significant
earthquakes, those located proximally enable a more accurate
location and recording of seismic activity, particularly for low-
magnitude local earthquakes. The inventory of seismic
stations in Antarctica (Table 1, Figure 1) includes the stations of the
International Registry of Seismograph Stations, which are
maintained by the International Seismological Centre and the World
Data Center for Seismology (http://www.isc.ac.uk/registries/).
However, it does not perform continuous control of the stations and
may be not be up to date. Permanent stations with real-time records
around the world are part of international virtual networks, such as
the Global Seismographic Network (GSN), which is part of the IRIS
consortium (https://www.iris.edu/hq/programs/gsn). The
permanent seismic stations of the IRIS network in Antarctica (e.g.
South Pole; Anthony et al., 2021) are shown in Figure 1. These
stations cover Antarctica and help quickly identify and locate major
earthquakes. Furthermore, several institutions from different
countries have deployed seismic stations in areas of high seismicity,
such as around the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula (e.g.
Seismographic Argentinian- Italian network, Linares et al., 2021;
Spanish network, and other stations, see Annex 1) and in Victoria
Land. Other countries are expanding and improving their seismic
networks.
In addition, non-permanent networks are important because they
allow lower earthquake detection thresholds, better understanding
the behaviour of seismicity in a region, and determining the
geological structures responsible for earthquake generation. They
have been deployed as part of the International Polar Year 2007-08,
such as the Polenet/Anet network (Figure 2) (https://polenet.org/
sites/), and some of them remain active. Several examples of
temporary deployments exist in the Bransfield Strait (Robertson-
Maurice et al. 2003; Dziak et al. 2010; Ibanez et al. 2017;
Almendros et al. 2020).
It is necessary to update the list of operational seismic stations to
determine whether there is sufficient station coverage in areas of
seismic hazard interest.
Seismicity distribution in Antarctica and seismic hazard
The USGS Earthquake Catalogue is one of the most comprehensive
databases providing information on the location of seismicity in
Antarctica (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/).
Most seismic activity south of 60˚S (Figure 3) is shallow (0-33 km
deep), mainly of tectonic origin, and is associated with plate
boundaries which in some cases is also linked to volcanic activity
(Reading, 2007; Kanao, 2014). Seismicity primarily occurs in
oceanic areas, but two continental regions show significant seismic
activity due to tectonic deformation: (i) the South Shetland Islands
– northern Antarctic Peninsula, and (ii) the Victoria Land – Ross
Sea.
The South Shetland continental block, which is separated from the
Antarctic Peninsula by a rifted basin in Bransfield Strait, is the area
with the highest seismic activity around Antarctica (Kaminuma,
1976; Pelayo and Wiens, 1989; Larter, 2001; Reading, 2007; Kanao,
2014) (Figure 4). Earthquakes with Mw>5 have affected this
region because of the tectonic opening of the Bransfield Strait,
reaching magnitudes of Mw 7.0 and Mw 6.9 on both extremes of
the strait due to ongoing crustal deformation, confirmed by the
earthquake focal mechanisms and geodetic GPS measurements.
Additionally, seismicity related to volcanic activity and ongoing
extension repeatedly occurs in the form of high-rate seismic
swarms. For example, in 2014, a seismic swarm with ~9000
earthquakes and maximum magnitude of 4.9 (mb) occurred SE of
Livingston Island (Almendros et al. 2018). A recent episode
southeast of King George Island has been particularly intense, when
a swarm of > 85.000 earthquakes reached magnitudes of up to Mw
5.7 (Olivet et al., 2021; Cesca et al., 2022). Further seismicity
unrest has also occurred near Deception Island (Carmona et al.,
2012; Moreno-Vacas and Almendros, 2021; Jiménez-Morales et al.,
2022). Further east, significant seismicity, including earthquakes
reaching Mw 7.7, occurs near the South Orkney Islands, and is
related to the slow left-lateral strike-slip motion on the Scotia/
Antarctic plate boundary (Ye et al., 2014).
In Victoria Land, seismicity is distributed (Adams, 1969; Reading,
2007; Kanao, 2014) (Figure 3) and reaches up to Mw 6.3, probably
related to the reactivation of a major geological boundary that
separates East and West Antarctica, limited by the Trans-Antarctic
Mountains, or related to glacial processes. Mount Erebus volcano,
located in Ross Island, also has related seismicity (Kaminuma, 1987;
Rowe et al., 1998).
Sparse seismicity also occurs in other Antarctic areas (Figure 3)
with magnitudes lower than Mw 5, probably related to glacial
seismotectonic activity associated with glacial isostatic adjustment
of Antarctica, which favours seismicity in continental crustal rocks
(Kaufmann et al., 2005; Pascal et al., 2010) and cryoseismicity
(Nettles et al., 2010) related to ice displacement. Significant clusters
of earthquakes reaching up to Mw 5.7 events occur in Queen Mary
Land (SE of Casey station), and up to Mw 5.4 in Adélie Land (west
of Dumont D’Urville station), but they are relatively far from the
nearest Antarctic stations.
The earthquake hazard begins to become significant when the
magnitude reaches Mw > 4, which can cause local damage.
However, the hazard to infrastructure and the development of
landslides and liquefaction increase when the magnitude reaches
Mw > 5. Most earthquakes reported in the region are shallow,
meaning that they are closer to the surface and thus pose a greater
hazard to surface infrastructure in active seismic areas.
There is a limited amount of research on evaluating peak ground
motion parameters and Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis
(PSHA) in Antarctica, with most studies being recent and focused
on local areas such as Palmer station (Feenstra et al., 2019) and
Scott Base (Burbidge et al., 2020). These contributions are crucial
for determining the seismic hazards in the region.
In addition, there are few studies on seismic-related effects, such as
landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction in Antarctica. The seismic
unrest at the Bransfield Strait (Olivet et al., 2021; Cesca et al.,
2022) has been interpreted as the result of crustal magmatic
intrusions on the base of seismological and geodetic data (Cesca et
al., 2022), although it could not be ruled out, so far, if this was
accompanied by a submarine eruption. Both shallow seismicity and
magmatic-driven seismicity have the potential to trigger tsunamis.
Moreover, the Antarctic Peninsula-Scotia Sea region has
experienced large submarine landslides that have been linked to
seismic activity (Ruano et al., 2014; Pérez et al., 2016). Large
submarine landslides have also affected the southern Weddell Sea
(Gales et al., 2014). However, no studies have examined the
potential for large submarine landslides that could result in
significant tsunamis, as observed in the Arctic Ocean (see, e.g.,
Vanneste et al., 2006; Pedrosa-González et al., 2022).
Vulnerability and seismic risk
The most seismically active and hazardous area of Antarctica,
which is relatively populated in comparison to most of Antarctica
and with a strong fluctuation of population over different seasons,
is the Shetland Islands, the Bransfield Strait coasts, and the northern
Antarctic Peninsula. Moving eastward, the South Orkney Islands
area is also one where there is a high seismic hazard, but with only
two Antarctic stations. The Argentinian Base Orcadas is exposed to
tsunami risk being only 4 m above the sea level and close to large
earthquakes (e.g, Mw7.7 November 17, 2013 earthquake) (Figure
5). The Victoria Land – Ross Sea area also has several Antarctic
stations and seismic activity is moderate.
Antarctic infrastructure is generally well built and designed to
withstand strong weather conditions with high horizontal stress.
Therefore, in general, constructions should also be relatively sturdy
to support earthquake shaking, although they should be tested.
However, interior furnishings may be most vulnerable to damage
and may pose the highest risk with regards to injuries from falling
debris, and should be evaluated accordingly.
The main vulnerability issue for coastal Antarctic stations is their
location. This placement increases the vulnerability to tsunamis that
may be produced by sharp seabed fault displacement or by the
indirect effect of submarine landslides. There is also a potential
vulnerability to far-travelled tsunamis resulting from great
earthquakes in other parts of the world.
Recommendations and conclusions
Seismic monitoring should be supported, particularly in areas of
high seismicity and where population is present (South Shetland
Islands - northern Antarctic Peninsula; Victoria Land). Monitoring
of other regions with seismic clusters should also be improved (e.g.,
Queen Mary Land, SE of Casey station and Adélie Land, west of
Dumont D’Urville station).
The seismic stations with adequate maintenance generally provide
the location of relevant earthquakes (Mw> 4 to 5). An update of
the database of operative seismic stations is necessary to identify
whether there is adequate station coverage in the areas of interest,
and to determine the threshold level of the seismic magnitude
captured by the permanent stations. Improved GNSS networks in
these regions can also help better identify ground deformations
related to seismic hazard.
Efficient sharing of records, ideally in real time, is needed to
quickly evaluate hazards related to seismic events.
Promotion of research related to the determination of ground
motion parameters, Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA)
supported by physics-based numerical simulations and modelling of
landslide stability close to Antarctic stations.
With respect to tsunami hazards, submarine faults and areas where
large landslides have occurred in the Bransfield Strait, South
Orkney Islands and Victoria Land should be identified to model
their tsunamigenic effects.
SCAR will continue to work with COMNAP towards further
assessment of seismic risk near Antarctic stations, noting that
priority should be given to the northern Antarctic Peninsula,
Bransfield Strait, South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands,
as well as to other regions with seismic clusters such as Victoria
Land, Ross Island, Queen Mary Land and Adélie Land.

Annex 1 – Information on existing seismic stations
Information from National Antarctic Programmes on seismic
stations in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands (as
reported to COMNAP, October 2022)
Argentina – seismic network comprising 7 permanent stations (AI
network). This network is run in conjunction with Italy, through an
agreement between the National Institute of Oceanography and
Applied Geophysics (OGS) in Trieste and Dirección Nacional del
Antártico (DNA)–Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA). The real‐time
waveforms from AI network are freely accessible from IRIS and
ORFEUS services. It improves the worldwide seismic networks’
detection capabilities and contributes to refining regional
earthquake locations released by the USGS. Argentina has other
instruments on Deception Island for volcanic monitoring and is
working to implement new instruments at 4 new monitoring
stations.
Republic of Korea – monitoring system on King George Island; it is
an on-going seismic project at initial stage.
Poland – two working devices transmitting online and the data are
available.
Ukraine – seismic station at Vernadsky Station.
Uruguay – seismic station on King George Island.
Deception and Livingston islands seismic network
The Spanish National Geographic Institute (IGN) is in charge since
September 2020 of the volcanic monitoring of Deception Island. To
meet this objective, during the last two campaigns (2021-2022 and
2022-2023), a new volcanic monitoring network has been set up.
The new network in Deception Island is formed by 5 permanent
broadband seismic stations and 3 GNSS stations for deformation
measurements. Each of the stations, consists of a stainless-steel-
structure hut that is energetically autonomous, sending both seismic
and GNSS data in real time to Spain, via a satellite link installed in
the Spanish Gabriel de Castilla Base. Moreover, in order to
strengthen the regional monitoring, the IGN has also installed a
seismic-GNSS station in the vicinity of the Spanish Juan Carlos I
Base, on the Livingston Island.
