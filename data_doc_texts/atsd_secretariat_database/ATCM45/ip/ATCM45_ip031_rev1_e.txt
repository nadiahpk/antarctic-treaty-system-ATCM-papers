Highlights of Scientific Research Results
Information Paper Submitted by the United States
Summary
The U.S. National Science Foundation has supported several
decades of research on the unique fish populations in ASPA 152
(Western Bransfield Strait) and ASPA 153 (Dallmann Bay).
Recognized as important habitat and probable spawning grounds
for several fish species, including the notothen (rockcod)
Notothenia coriiceps and the icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus, these
ASPAs were established in 1991 as important sites for scientific
research and protection of the dynamic fish and benthic
communities there. The research summarized below has resulted in
dozens of scientific publications on the marine communities of
ASPAs 152 and 153 that span the disciplines of ecology, physiology,
climate change impact, evolution, and genomics. Research
highlights from these disciplines are described.
Ecology
On the High Antarctic shelf, Notothenioids (which includes
icefishes) today dominate the fish fauna and are recognized as one
of the few examples of a species flock of marine fishes.
Studies of these fishes advance the understanding of the
ectothermic mode of life, especially in extreme cold.
Antarctic fish, especially in their early larval stages, are an
important component of the food web that sustains life in the cold
Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. Larvae feed on smaller
organisms (phytoplankton and zooplankton) and in turn are eaten
by larger animals. Some adult notothenioid species are important
prey for seals and killer whales.
Western Bransfield Strait supports a rich seasonal bloom of
microorganisms at the base of the food web, and Thysanoessa
macrura is the most common euphausiid.

Physiology
Icefishes are physiologically unique as they are the only vertebrates
that are white-blooded, meaning they lack hemoglobin, the protein
of red blood cells that binds oxygen in the blood, and have lost the
red blood cells that carry hemoglobin. It has been hypothesized that
these mutations were selectively advantageous in the icefish lineage
because they might decrease oxidative damage within the body,
thereby conferring an evolutionary advantage in the extremely cold
and oxygen-rich waters of the Southern Ocean. However, this
hypothesis is not universally accepted, and the white blood of
icefishes may simply be a result of neutral mutations. Nonetheless,
icefishes have co-evolved a
suite of physiological changes that maintain cardiac and circulatory
function in the absence of hemoglobin.
Neutral buoyancy is unusual in notothenioid fishes; however, many
species of the flock have evolved toward neutral buoyancy, a trait
that facilitates feeding in the water column.

Climate Change
Antarctic fishes live near the limits of their physiological tolerance
and are threatened by warming temperatures, ocean acidification,
and commercial fishing pressures.
White-blooded icefishes are particularly sensitive to increasing
temperatures due to their lack of hemoglobin, and studies on these
“sentinel species” investigate their responses to current and
projected warming of the waters surrounding the Antarctic
Peninsula.
The cellular proteome of Antarctic fishes will likely be resilient to
current rates of warming, at least for several centuries.
However, embryos of Notothenia coriiceps developed twice as
quickly under projected warming scenarios for the next two
centuries. Accelerated embryonic development would result in a
decoupling of the phenology of hatching and light-driven food
availability (phytoplankton), with hatchling starvation a likely
outcome. Moreover, a significant proportion of embryos develop
abnormally at warmer temperatures, which also would negatively
affect food web dynamics and hatchling recruitment.
In 2018 researchers discovered that specimens of the crowned
notothen Trematomus scotti near the ASPA 152/153 area exhibited
highly concerning large pink tumors that covered 10-30% of their
bodies. One specimen of a diseased painted notothen Nototheniops
larseni was found in ASPA 153. The researchers determined that
rare single-celled parasites called “X-Cells” are causing the tumors.
The disease is causing weight loss and other detrimental health
impacts in affected fishes. Studies are under way to learn more
about this phenomenon, but it may be a result of warming waters
and melting ice in the habitat.

Evolution and Genomics
Multiple studies have been performed to investigate the
evolutionary loss of Hemoglobin (Hb) and Myoglobin (Mb) in
icefishes. Results suggest that deletion of genomic regions
containing hemoglobin genes may have been facilitated by mobile
genetic elements.
Understanding of genome evolution in Antarctic notothenioid fishes
is rapidly advancing based on specimens collected in ASPAs 152
and 153 and the Western Antarctic Peninsula. These genome
sequences have shown that expansion of mobile genetic elements
and evolution of novel microRNAs have contributed to notothenioid
adaptation. The public availability of these genomes is stimulating
worldwide research on the notothenioid species flock.

Applications to Human Health
Results of icefish studies have led to a greater understanding of the
mechanisms responsible for oxidative stress, which is a
phenomenon associated with multiple human diseases (cancer,
Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s) and aging.
Comparison of the expression of blood genes by white-blooded
icefishes and closely related, but red-blooded, notothenioids
revealed the role of hemogen as an important transcription factor
that is required for the terminal maturation of red blood cells.
Comparative studies (see previous bullet) also revealed that the
bloodthirsty gene encodes an RBCC/TRIM gene required for
erythropoiesis.
Research on the unique, cold-adapted microtubule proteins of
Antarctic fishes may lead to new therapies for treatment of cancers,
dementias, injuries, and other diseases.
