Irreversible near-term consequences of Southern Ocean acidification
with current CO2 emissions pathways
Information Paper submitted by ASOC
Summary
CO2 levels in the atmosphere have exceeded 423 ppm several times
in 2023, exhibiting the same year-on-year increase of ≈2.5ppm
that began in the early 2000s. Should this current rate continue,
atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will reach the 450ppm critical
level, established by the National Academies, in just eleven years.
Shell damage due to acidification has already been observed in
samples taken from the Ross Sea in 2006. Only the lowest IPCC
Sixth Assessment (AR6) emissions pathways, in which emissions
decrease by 43% in the next eight years, will prevent widespread
shell damage throughout the Southern Ocean, in long-tail ocean
chemistry processes that will persist for 30-70,000 years.
Recent Research of Concern
Mounting research indicates that that a high emissions scenario
would lead to catastrophic Southern Ocean marine species loss by
2100, at a scale on par with the five mass ocean extinction events in
Earth’s past.1, 2
Exposure to new stressors such as nanoplastics could worsen the
effects of acidification for Southern Ocean marine species.3
Westerly winds have shifted closer to the Antarctic continent,
causing water eddies to erode the base of ice sheets and increase
meltwater input into the ocean. This shift may have negative
impacts on Southern Ocean ecosystems and species, and
underscores the influence this ice sheet holds over local ecosystems,
as well as the global climate system.4
Sea ice loss is increasing the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide
by surface water and driving rapid acidification of the western
Arctic Ocean at a rate three to four times higher than that of the
other ocean basins; as sea ice is lost around Antarctica, portions of
the Southern Ocean may soon see similar dynamics.5 A decline in
plankton diversity and carbon flux has already been observed in the
waters off the West Antarctic Peninsula, where ice-free conditions
occurred during the past austral summer.6
Background
Increasing CO2 concentration leads not only to climate change, but
also to increasing rates of acidification of the world’s oceans.7
Oceans provide a vital service to the global climate system by
absorbing CO2; limiting global warming, despite sharp increases in
human carbon emissions. However, such ocean carbon absorption
comes with a price: when dissolved into seawater, CO2 forms
carbonic acid (H₂CO₃). This phenomenon is known as ocean
acidification; and rates of acidification today are faster than at any
point in the past 300 million years.8
The Southern and Arctic Oceans have absorbed the lion’s share of
this dissolved CO2, mostly because colder and fresher waters can
hold more carbon, which gets transferred to deep waters allowing
more CO2 to be taken up at the surface. By some estimates,
Antarctic waters have absorbed up to 40% of the total carbon taken
up by the world’s oceans thus far.9 This makes it an important
carbon sink, helping to hold down global heating. This “sink” harms
polar marine
environments, however, because it also results in higher rates of
acidification than anywhere else on Earth.
Acidification makes it more difficult for Southern Ocean shell-
building animals to build and maintain their structures; while in all
water-dwelling organisms, ocean acidification increases the energy
costs to maintain pH in the cells and tissues. In this way, ocean
acidification harms key organisms such as marine gastropods and
pteropods, sea urchins, clams, and crabs.10 Polar species of the
Southern Ocean are adapted to the stable pH, temperature and
saltwater conditions that have existed for several million years.
They are sensitive to even small changes in seawater chemistry. 11
There is currently no practical way for humans to reverse ocean
acidification. The only way to slow and eventually, halt the
acidification process is through rapid CO2 emissions reductions and
future carbon dioxide removal (CDR). If emissions continue to rise,
these more acidic conditions will persist for tens of thousands of
years. This is because processes that buffer the acidity from the
ocean occur very slowly, over nearly geologic time scales. Although
CO2 “only” lasts for 800-1000 years in the atmosphere, ocean
processes are much slower. It will take some 50-70,000 years to
bring acidification and its impacts back to pre-industrial levels,
following the weathering of rocks on land into the ocean.12 This
very long lifetime of acidification in the oceans is one reason why
mitigation efforts focused on “solar-radiation management,” as
opposed to decreasing atmospheric CO2 represent a special threat
to the health of the Southern Ocean environment.
In the Southern Ocean, the ability of some vulnerable organisms to
build shells declined by around 4% between 1998 and 2014.
Pteropods – tiny marine snails known as “sea butterflies” – are
particularly susceptible to these expanding corrosive waters, with
shell damage documented in several Southern Ocean regions.13
Pteropods are important in the polar food web, serving as a key
source of food for the young of many marine species.
Global temperatures peaking at 1.5°C will occur at atmospheric CO2
levels of around 450 ppm, which scientists of the Inter-academy
Panel (a consortium of national Academies of Sciences) identified in
2008 as an important threshold for serious global ocean
acidification.14 However, current pledges (even if completely
fulfilled) will result in CO2 levels above 500 ppm, and temperatures
of around 2.1°C.15 At that point, acidity will have more than
doubled in the Southern Ocean, projected to cause widespread areas
of corrosive waters.
Global ocean acidity has been relatively stable over the past several
million years. Today’s rate of change is unprecedented, however, in
at least the past 300 million years, when severe changes in ocean
conditions, including high rates of acidification resulted in the mass
extinction of many organisms. The speed of today’s acidification is
therefore a key part of its threat: it is occurring far too quickly to
allow species of today to evolve and survive.20
The Southern Ocean around Antarctica also has warmed more than
other ocean regions, in particular the western Antarctic Peninsula,
placing additional stress on ecosystems and species.19 The
Bellingshausen Sea was completely ice-free in 2023, which will
increase both acidification and warming in this region. Southern
Ocean warming also seems increasingly important in overall global
ocean heat increase. Ocean pollution, particularly that from
plastics, add another layer of stress to Southern Ocean species.3
Southern Ocean waters contain some of the world’s richest fisheries
and most diverse marine ecosystems. At 2°C or higher, the
combination of sea ice loss for several months of the year, ocean
warming, freshening and acidification will alter this marine
ecosystem beyond our recognition. A world kept close to 1.5°C or
lower can limit these irreversible effects on Southern Ocean
ecosystems and fisheries, though some losses unfortunately are now
inevitable.12 The projected effects of climate-induced stressors on
this marine ecosystem will have negative implications for the global
economy.3,12
Increased run-off from glaciers and the Antarctic ice sheet is also
freshening surface waters. This colder, fresher water sits like a lid
on top of the deeper, warmer and saltier levels below, preventing
nutrients from reaching the surface where most species live.10,18
This phenomenon of a freshwater “lid” can also impact ocean
currents, including the Global Meridional Ocean Circulation
(GMOC). Freshwater incursion from the Antarctic ice sheet
therefore has consequences for global circulation of important
nutrients, gases and heat.
These impacts above 2°C are essentially irreversible, and will occur
with all but the very lowest emissions pathways. These require a
50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, motivated by high
ambition and commitment toward global decarbonization; with
essentially zero emissions by 2050, and negative emissions
(removing carbon from the atmosphere) thereafter.15 Until, and
unless, human-caused CO2 levels begin to fall sharply, there is high
likelihood that the damage to Southern Ocean species observed thus
far are a harbinger of much worse to come.
Input from ATCM
While global oceans have received increasing attention through a
variety of forums, including the annual UNFCCC Oceans and
Climate Dialogues, the closeness of the Southern Ocean to serious
and irreversible acidification thresholds remains virtually
unaddressed in these forums. Parties and Stakeholders should
consider ways to raise this serious threat to marine ecosystems and
fisheries from CO2 levels that continue to rise toward the critical
450ppm threshold identified by the research community fifteen
years ago.
