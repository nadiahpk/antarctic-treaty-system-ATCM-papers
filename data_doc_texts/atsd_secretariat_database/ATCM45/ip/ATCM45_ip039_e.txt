United Kingdom procedures for preventing the introduction or
spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Antarctica
United Kingdom procedures for preventing the introduction or
spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Antarctica
Summary
This paper provides information on the procedures that the United
Kingdom has put in place to prevent the introduction or spread of
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Antarctica.
Introduction
Since the beginning of 2022, the increasing intensity of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks has resulted in
the death of hundreds of thousands of seabirds in the Northern
Hemisphere, around the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and southern
Africa. There is a heightened risk of HPAI being introduced to
Antarctica.
ATCM XLV WP3 Surveillance and coordination for the prevention
and detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Antarctica
recommends that the CEP encourages Parties to develop and
implement procedures for preventing the introduction or spread of
HPAI by their National Antarctic Programs. The United Kingdom
takes the opportunity to provide information on procedures
implemented during the 2022-2023 season to prevent the
introduction or spread of HPAI in Antarctica.
United Kingdom HPAI Response
The United Kingdom’s response plan for HPAI (at Annex A) applies
to all members of the UK’s National Antarctic Programme (British
Antarctic Survey). The response plan follows a phased approach,
based on a regular risk assessment process that is applied as new
evidence arises.
Throughout the 2022-2023 season the United Kingdom also
required participants in UK-authorised activities in Antarctica to
follow guidelines to prevent the spread of HPAI (Annex B). The
guidelines were based on the recommendations in the report The
Risk of Avian Influenza in the Southern Ocean: A practical guide for
operators interacting with wildlife Dewar et al. 2022. The
guidelines required taking steps such as thoroughly removing any
soiled material from boots and disinfecting clothing before visiting;
assessing whether colonies might potentially be infected with HPAI;
aborting visits if there are signs of an unusual/mass mortality event
or behavioural signs of HPAI within a colony; and maintaining
minimum distances from wildlife at all times. Authorised
participants were required to report any signs of HPAI to the UK
National Competent Authority.
The United Kingdom will review its procedures and guidelines in
advance of the 2023-2024 season to ensure they remain up to date
and that they reflect the risk and any new science.

Purpose of the paper
_____________________________________________________________
The purpose of this paper is to discuss the risks and contingencies
associated to the Avian Influenza epidemic (AI) seen in the
Northern Hemisphere. There are substantial concerns that the
epidemic will spread southward (through South America) over the
coming months with migrating birds. As a result, there could be
scenes of mass mortality in certain bird species in the Antarctic
region, as observed already in, for example, UK seabird colonies on
the Farne Islands and Bass Rock. The current assessment of the risk
of that scenario occurring in Antarctica is ‘low’; however, BAS has a
duty to respond and prepare to protect both the bird colonies that
we study and the personnel who carry out that work.
Current risks identified
______________________________________________________________
Risk to human health
The current risk to human health has been assessed by the UK
Health and Safety Executive as ‘very low’ (minimal). The risk is
increased through conditions such as enclosed poultry farms with
high levels of dust and close contact with confirmed infected birds.
Cases of the current strain of AI have been recorded in a small
number of humans, but all have been asymptomatic. The current
consensus from UK Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and
the UK HSE is human safety controls only need to be implemented
once AI is ‘suspected’ in a local bird population. Up to that point,
close monitoring and awareness of
the potential for AI to arrive is considered an appropriate response.
Normal working practices should prevail (Phase 0). Once AI is
‘suspected’ in a bird population, face-fitted masks and other PPE
will likely be required when handling birds for science (Phase 1).
NOTE: The BAS Health and Safety Team have provided the teams
who will be working with birds this season (22/23) with
appropriate training, face mask fit testing and supplies of
contingency stocks of appropriate PPE and materials.
Risk that BAS could spread AI through its activities
The primary biosecurity risk originates from the transfer of AI-
contaminated material (e.g., dead birds, guano, etc.) between major
locations of operation. In the BAS operation, transfer of AI is most
likely to occur via cargo on board vessels that has been
contaminated following exposure to local bird population whilst
being stored outside. Lack of data makes the assessment of the
effectiveness of currently implemented BAS biosecurity measures
difficult to ascertain. However, existing practices, such as cleaning
of cargo, vehicles, footwear, etc., will reduce the risk.
Risk to science business continuity
A widespread AI outbreak (Phase 3) is likely to have a major impact
on the delivery of existing research projects concerning bird and,
potentially, seal populations. The current risk assessment suggests
the risk of AI effecting the Antarctic bird populations is potentially
low. AI infected birds are likely to have their navigation abilities
severely impaired, which may reduce the likelihood of infected
birds completing their long-distance migration routes to the South
Atlantic region. Nevertheless, sequential shorter movements of
infected birds through South America will likely bring AI to the
Antarctic region within the next 2 years.
BAS science teams are working to prioritise their research activities
to facilitate more rapid decision making in the event of a suspected
or confirmed AI outbreak.
The worst case scenario
Whilst very unlikely in an Antarctic context, there have been three
cases of AI transmission to seals in the Northern Hemisphere.
Should AI transmission from birds to marine mammals occur near a
BAS research station, the potential risk to humans coming in close
contact with the seal population would be a major concern.
Advisers from APHA UK suggest that such a scenario would
necessitate a reassessment of the safety of personnel remaining on
station.
Reputational risk
The issue of AI is being considered by IAATO, the Foreign,
Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and many national
Antarctic programmes. Owing to BAS’s science activities on highly
important bird colonies, it is vital BAS demonstrates an appropriate
and competent response and identifies appropriate mitigation
measures to minimise the potential threat of spreading AI between
bird populations. For this reason, BAS has sought out authoritative
advice from the APHA, i.e., the APHA Avian Virology Workgroup
Leader and Deputy Director of the International Reference
Laboratory for Avian Influenza, Swine Influenza and Newcastle
Disease. See Appendix 1.
The BAS Contingency Plan for Avian Influenza (AI)
______________________________________________________________
Phased approach
A phased approach is being applied to the BAS response to AI. It is
anticipated that Phase 0 will prevail but planned contingencies will
be implemented to control further eventualities. The phased
approach is based on a regular risk assessment process that will be
applied as new evidence arises. Current predictions suggest that
BAS will remain in Phase 0 for the foreseeable future. However, the
likelihood of AI arriving at our Gateways should be
considered likely at some stage in the future. Should this occur,
then it could be anticipated that suspected AI cases in the vicinity of
BAS stations may be immanent.
Phase 0
No change to current ways of working with bird populations
Existing biological safety and hygiene practices should be
maintained
Maintain heightened awareness (training) and undertake existing
biosecurity checks for cargo transfers and storage
Monitor reports of AI in South American bird population
Monitor local bird populations for signs of pathogenicity (in
consultation with BAS Cambridge team)
The main focus of Phase 0 will be to monitor progress of cases of AI
through South America. The monitoring activity will be led by the
BAS AI Risk Review Team using a variety of sources. The
monitoring will also include any reported changes in the level of AI
virus pathogenicity to humans.
Phase 1
AI confirmed at Gateways
Personnel at Gateways instructed to stop visits to local bird colonies
Review risk assessment for those activities which involve close
contact with birds
Review station practices to reduce the risk of local spread of AI
Should AI be suspected or confirmed at Gateways then the BAS AI
Response Team will review the risk assessments for activities
associated with birds. The risk to health will continue to be low but
heightened safety controls may begin at this point.
Phase 2
Monitoring shows enhanced levels of bird mortality near stations
Pause all work requiring physical contact with birds or bird colonies
visits for further assessment
Decision point: either move back to Phase 1, or progress to Phase 3
Phase 2 is intended to be a brief decision phase. Available data shall
be reviewed, and expert advice sought. Confirmation (resulting
from laboratory analysis of samples) of the presence of AI infected
birds in colonies near stations will take some time. Consequently,
rapid decision making may be required without the benefit of full
information, and therefore a precautionary approach will be
required, i.e., either to return to Phase 1 or to escalate the situation
to Phase 3.
Phase 3
AI outbreak in local bird colony strongly indicated or confirmed
Only risk assessed and approved activities to proceed (both science
& stations)
AI confirmatory samples to be collected for the APHA UK by
training personnel only
Local seal populations to be closely monitored for signs of unusual
mortality levels
Exclusion zones and disinfection areas established for the stations
Should a Phase 3 situation be declared, then the BAS Cambridge AI
Risk Review Team shall undertake a risk assessment review and
only approve priority science activities involving birds. The risk
assessment review will also consider operational and recreational
activities that could facilitate exposure to or spread of the virus. At
this point, it shall be mandatory that individuals with permission to
continue working in close contact with birds shall use fit tested PPE
and protective clothing.
To reduce risks to health and virus transmission in the vicinity of
the station, heightened biosecurity measures are anticipated
involving, for example, clothing and outdoor footwear cleaning
routines.
Phase 4
Suspected evidence of AI within the seal population
Halt all interactions with seals
Undertake risk assessment and obtain specialist advice
BAS Major Incident system initiated to manage response
Phase 4 is intended to be a brief decision phase (similar to Phase 2).
AI infection and symptoms in seals, as a result of the virus jumping
from birds to mammals, is a cause for concern regarding the health
of humans in the local vicinity. BAS should seek advice from
relevant experts and stakeholder in order to undertake a risk
assessment to ensure personnel are not at risk of contracting AI. In
this scenario BAS will use the BAS Major Incident Plan, Bronze,
Silver, Gold structure to manage and make appropriate decisions.
Monitoring
______________________________________________________________
BAS AI Risk Review Team
A critical task for BAS is to remain informed of risks associated with
AI and the location of outbreaks in the Southern Hemisphere. There
will be a BAS AI Risk Review Team who will meet regularly to
review the situation and facilitate appropriate decision-making and
authority regarding AI in Antarctica. The team will monitor (i)
reports of the spread of AI in bird populations in the Southern
Hemisphere and (ii) emerging evidence that the virus has changed
pathogenically whereby the potential risk to human health is
increased. The team will be chaired by the Head of Risk and
Assurance. The November meeting of the BAS Management Team
will provide confirmation and approval that this team is given the
authority to make decisions regarding risk controls for AI through
Phases 0, 1, 2 and 3. Should the situation warrant a Phase 4
situation to be declared, then it is expected the BAS Major Incident
System will be instigated and BAS Gold team will take over decision
making.
Reporting
______________________________________________________________
A monthly update to the BAS Management Team will be provided
by the BAS AI Risk Review Team to ensure any changing risk levels
are understood.
The Station Leaders will be kept abreast of the current status of AI
so that any move between phases is anticipated and the context
understood. BAS AI Risk Review Team will also require regular
reporting and monitoring by Station Leaders and staff for AI-related
evidence.

Appendix 1 summary of advice from Animal Plant Health Agency
Avian Influenza update
19 October 2022
Key Points – understanding influenza virus classification and
surveillance
The seasonal highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus has
two types – Type A and Type B.
There are eight RNA gene segments that contain the instructions for
viral replication
The virus surface proteins – hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA) – determine important biochemical and infection properties of
the virus.
Genetic variations can alter the proteins, and thereby properties of
the virus.
The Centre for Disease Control undertake ongoing surveillance of
both human and animal influenza strains to monitor genetic
mutations, including characteristics that
can alter infection risk, severity of symptoms and effectiveness of
vaccines and antiviral treatments.
Surveillance includes the potential for influenza virus in animals to
infect humans.
Human avian flu infections are considered rare.
Risks
Current risk to humans
Overall risk to public health from the strain of avian influenza
(A(H5N1)) involved in current outbreaks in the UK is considered
very low.
To date, no cases of pathogenicity involving the strain of A(H5N1)
currently present in Northern Hemisphere bird populations have
been detected in humans.
Positive cases of the current strain of A(H5N1) in humans are rare
(and have only been seen where humans are in close proximity to
poultry/water fowl) and were asymptomatic.
Person to person transfer has not been detected.
Current risk to bird populations
The current A(H5N1) strain is highly pathogenic within bird
populations.
Infection is present in migratory pathways, increasing the spread of
infection geographically.
High mortality rates are seen in some species, others appear to
recover.
Water birds are the main source of infection.
The neurological effects of the virus is likely to impact migratory
ability: viral spread to Antarctic via migratory species originating in
the Northern Hemisphere in low.
Some cases have been reported recently in the southern USA.
Therefore, there is a strong risk of viral spread to South America.
Current risk to mammals
A(H1N1) has been shown to transmit to mammals (seals, foxes,
bobcats, rats…)
It is thought that infection occurs as a result of scavenging and the
consumption of infected birds.
The neurological effects of viral infection include brain
inflammation which can alter behaviour, e.g. foxes twitching and
walking in circles, bobcats having no fear of humans. Utimately,
viral infection in mammals can result in seizures and death.
It is not thought likely that the virus can be transferred between
individual mammals.
Recommendations from a biological safety perspective
Current situation
The current human risk as a result of standard human activity
around BAS stations and during interactions with wildlife is
considered minimal. Steps should be taken to increase the
awareness of BAS personnel to the biological risks and need for
good personal hygiene and biosecurity measures.
BAS should monitor for outbreaks in South America, and if
detected, move to the next risk level.
BAS should monitor available information on the level of risk to
human health. The BAS risk level should be increased if the Centre
for Disease Control (CDC) or Animal and Plant Health Agency
(APHA) advise changes.
PPE (including the use of a face mask and eye protection) should be
worn where the appropriate activity risk assessment identifies
increased biological hazard resulting from aerosols/fluids, such as
contact with guano or collecting biological samples.
Steps should there be an Increase in risk of infection resulting from
the viral strain reaching bird populations in the wider Antarctic
region
BAS personnel should increase vigilance for signs of the virus and
associated symptoms in local bird populations.
Activities should be re-assessed with regard to their risk of
biological hazard risk in light of an increase potential for virus to be
present the wildlife populations. Decisions to (i) cease activities
involving interaction with wildlife, (ii) increase PPE or (iii) modify
procedures to reduce risk should be taken as deemed appropriate.
Keep 1m distance from birds where possible for work activities.
Biosecurity measures shall be increased for travel between Antarctic
sites and on each BAS station.
BAS personnel shall record and report any suspected infections:
date, time, location, description of symptoms and behaviours. A
video shall be taken, if possible. (See BAS Animal Mass Animal
Mortality Event response plan within the BAS Biosecurity
Regulations)
BAS shall provide clear instruction not to touch any sick or dead
birds.
Suspected outbreak in bird populations in sub-Antarctica/Antarctica
All activities involving interaction with wildlife shall be paused and
the situation monitored.
Instruction not to touch any sick or dead birds shall be reiterated
Any suspected new infections shall be reported and recorded.
Information reported shall include: date, time, location, description
of symptoms and behaviours. A video shall be taken, if possible.
Activities should be re-assessed with regard to their risk of
biological hazard risk in light of the presence of the virus in local
wildlife populations. Decisions to (i) cease activities involving
interaction with wildlife, (ii) increase PPE (gloves, face masks,
goggles/visor, waterproof outer clothing), or (iii) modify procedures
to reduce risk should be taken as deemed appropriate.
Staff shall increase vigilance for signs and symptoms in other local
bird populations and seal populations.
Following full discussion and training by BAS Cambridge personnel,
a nominated person is to collect samples for subsequent return to
UK for analysis (detailed instructions to be provided).
Suspected outbreak in mammal populations in sub-Antarctica/
Antarctica
Pause all activities in the vicinity of the suspected outbreak and
restrict movement to Station only.
Report immediately to the BAS H&S Office.
Provide details of the suspected outbreak including: Date, time,
location, description of symptoms and behaviours. Provide a video,
if possible.
Wait for a response from BAS Cambridge before taking any further
action.
Annex B: Guidelines that all UK-authorised activity participants
were required to follow during the 2022-23 season
Avian influenza 
 
Since the beginning of 2022, the increasing intensity of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks has resulted in
the death of hundreds of thousands of seabirds in the Northern
Hemisphere, around the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and southern
Africa. There is a heightened risk of HPAI being introduced to
Antarctica during the 2022/23 Austral summer by migrating
seabirds. If you detect signs of HPAI you must report this to the
permit authority, which may issue further specific instructions.  
 
The below guidelines should be followed to prevent the spread of
HPAI.  
 
Before leaving for Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic: 
 
All expeditioners/guides working in other wildlife areas (e.g.,
seabird colonies, the Arctic, Alaska, etc.) should thoroughly remove
any soiled material (i.e., soil, faeces) from their boots and disinfect
all clothing, footwear and any equipment before leaving for
Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic to prevent introduction of HPAI
from other wildlife areas. It is recommended to use new clothes,
footwear and equipment when possible. 
 
All guests should remove all soiled material and disinfect footwear
before boarding the vessel, especially if they have been near
wildlife colonies.  
 
The use of Virkon™ S, F10 or soap followed by 10% bleach is
recommended for disinfection of boots and outer clothing. 
 
Before visiting a colony or wildlife aggregation: 
 
In general, regional specific advice/regulation may exist, so you
should adopt whichever is the more precautionary. 
 
To identify if a colony is potentially infected with HPAI, an
appropriately trained or experienced guide/research team should be
sent out via zodiac and avoid landing if possible (or via high
vantage point at remote southern colonies) and observe the colony
using binoculars to look for carcasses and behaviour of live birds
(further information in guidance - https://ecoevorxiv.org/8jrbu/)
before entering site/sending tourists/parties to shore. In case of
terrestrial approaching, observations using binoculars will be made
at a distance of 150 m from the closest animal aggregation. 
 
If there are signs of an unusual/mass mortality event or behavioural
signs of HPAI within a colony, the visit should be aborted.
Equipment and clothing should be disinfected as soon as possible
and the observations reported to your permit authority
immediately. There may also be other specific reporting forms or
procedures, particularly for sub-Antarctic Islands. 
 
In general, all equipment (including boots, backpacks, hiking poles,
tripods, and cones or route markers, etc.) should be cleaned of any
soiled material (i.e., soil, faeces) and disinfected before
disembarking the boat/leaving base and every time after visiting a
colony. 
 
During a visit: 
 
Unless permitted, visitors to wildlife colonies, should always keep a
minimum distance of 5 metres from wildlife, in addition to strict
adherence to IAATO guidelines/ATCM general guidelines or any
other local requirements (https://documents.ats.aq/recatt/
att483_e.pdf) given a greater distance may be required for different
animal species and age cohorts. If an animal spontaneously
approaches an individual or visitors, they should retreat to ensure
this minimum distance is rigorously adhered to unless specifically
studying or sampling animals. 
 
People should refrain from sitting on or lying on bare ground or
rocks, or leaving any equipment on bare ground or rocks close to
animal activity or faecal matter (within 10 metres of nests, haul-out
sites or pathways). Freshwater pools should also be avoided. 
 
To minimise animal exposure to equipment/potential fomite
transmission (i.e., transmission from objects or equipment carrying
infection), field equipment should not be left unattended and
should be kept far from wildlife. 
 
Visitors should adhere to strict recommendations for personal
hygiene at all times (frequent hand washing for the appropriate
time and regular disinfection). 
 
Never touch birds, dead or alive unless you have a permit that in
this case specifically includes birds with suspected disease.  
 
Post visit: 
 
All equipment (including boots, tripods, etc.) should be also cleaned
of any soiled material (i.e., soil, faeces) and disinfected upon
returning to the ship or a base after a shore visit. Wear a mask to
prevent inhalation during cleaning. 
 
Field equipment disinfection procedures should be carried out prior
to and after shore visits.
