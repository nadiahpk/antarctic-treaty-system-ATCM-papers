Background
Satellite imagery is a transformational technology that has radically
expanded our capacity to explore and study the world’s most
remote places. Over just the last 30 years, the availability of
publicly-available satellite imagery of Antarctica has skyrocketed,
and commensurate improvements in spatial resolution now allow us
to map the finest details of Antarctica’s geology and even much of
its biology. Newly-launched sensors now allow scientists to measure
ice loss, follow the flow of glaciers, map Antarctica’s bedrock, and
even track the distribution and abundance of animal populations. At
the same time, we can now harness satellite imagery to track
human impacts on the landscape, from runways to footpaths, and
more precisely design protected areas around key features. This
Information Paper summarises the 2023 SCAR Lecture by Prof
Heather Lynch, and describes the recent technical advances in the
use of satellite imagery for Antarctic research and some of the
future research areas where continued development is likely.
Antarctic geology and climate change
Many of the most notable scientific findings to emerge from
Antarctica over the last several years have relied on satellite-based
remote sensing in some fashion, and both active sensors (e.g., radar,
LiDAR) and passive sensors (e.g., Landsat, MODIS) have been
critical to our current understanding of climate change, glacial
retreat, ice sheet instability, and the very nature of the Antarctic
continent itself.
Of particular note are several recent studies that improve our
understanding of Antarctic ice sheet dynamics and mass loss,
particularly the improved mapping of Antarctic bed topography
known as BedMachine (Morlighem et al. 2020) and several
subsequent studies using BedMachine to understand ice sheet
evolution (e.g., Seroussi et al. 2020, Velicogna et al. 2020).
Satellites have also been critical in tracking the advance and retreat
of ice shelves, improving our understanding of major events such as
the disintegration of the Larsen A and B ice shelves (Wille et al.
2019, Christie et al. 2022) and the partial collapse of the Wilkins
Ice Shelf (Rankl et al. 2017), as well as the more gradual processes
that drive ice sheet dynamics (e.g., Gudmundsson et al. 2019, Wille
et al. 2019) and glacial retreat (e.g., Milillo et al. 2022). One of the
most advanced satellite systems measuring ice mass is the Gravity
Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on
mission GRACE-FO. These two missions allow for extremely precise
measurements of surface mass anomalies and have allowed us to
track the loss of ice contained within the Antarctic ice sheet
(Velicogna et al. 2014).
Many of these advances involved the careful synthesis of satellite-
based data products with airborne or field observations,
highlighting the manner in which satellite data complements, rather
than replaces, field observations and measurements. For example,
Schmidt et al. (2023) used an underwater vehicle to observe the
grounding line of the Thwaites Glacier and the detailed topography
of the ice base. These observations provide a better understanding
of the processes contributing to ice melt observed using satellite
imagery (e.g., Fahnestock et al. 2016, Wild et al. 2022).
Climate change is unfolding in Antarctica on both fast and slow
time scales, and satellite remote sensing provides a means by which
we can track tiny changes occurring over long periods of time as
well as sudden events, like a collapsing ice shelf, that would
otherwise be inaccessible to scientific observation. Satellites also
recently marked an inauspicious record when, on February 13,
2023, Antarctic sea ice extent hit an all-time low (NSIDC 2023).
These dynamics have globally-important implications for global
temperature variability and sea level rise (Golledge et al. 2019,
DeConto et al. 2021), and satellites have played an important role
in our understanding of these future risks.
Wildlife research Some of this text has been adapted from an article
originally written for the Marine Technology Society Journal (Lynch
[2023]).
Satellite imagery has been in regular use for earth observation and
monitoring for over 40 years but much of this work has been
focused on mapping the planet itself (ocean colour, sea ice, forest
cover, etc.) rather than the animals that live on it. Though the idea
that we could use satellites to map polar seabirds was explored
early on (Schwaller et al. 1984, Schwaller et al. 1989), the last
decade has seen a major expansion of these efforts in step with a
rapid increase in the number and variety of sensors now currently
available for wildlife research. Wildlife research in the polar regions
has historically been limited by the logistical constraints of site
access, but recent developments in the use of satellite imagery for
animal detection has unlocked new possibilities for pan-Antarctic
monitoring of animal populations. A range of different sensor
systems have been used for wildlife research but most have focused
on optical sensors that collect data in the visible spectrum and can
be directly interpreted similar to a photograph. These include
medium-resolution sensors like Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10
m) and very high-resolution sensors such as Maxar’s Worldview-2
(51 cm) and Worldview-3 (31 cm). These long-established satellite
systems have been joined more recently by constellations of smaller
satellites (so-called ‘Small Sats’) that offer imagery of comparable
spatial and spectral resolution to those operated by Maxar. This
rapidly-expanding portfolio of earth observation satellites offers the
potential for a radical transformation of wildlife research in polar
regions, but the sheer volume of data now being collected now
eclipses our capacity for manual imagery interpretation. To meet
this challenge, researchers are now harnessing advances in
computer vision that, coupled with improvements in computing
capacity, promise to deliver a new era in our ability to monitor
polar wildlife.
Worldwide, satellite imagery has been used to survey everything
from penguins and whales to cattle and elephants (see review by
LaRue et al. 2017 and references therein). Though the potential for
wildlife survey by satellite imagery is global, several factors have
made the polar regions a leader in the technical development and
operationalization of satellite-based monitoring. For one, the polar
areas are exceptionally difficult and expensive to survey using more
traditional means, so alternative methods provide not only a
complement to but often the only feasible means of tracking
wildlife over large spatial areas. Research in the polar regions,
particularly the Antarctic, is also inherently international. The
confluence of multiple earth observation programmes operating in
the polar regions provides the opportunity to compare and combine
the strengths of different sensor programmes. The absence of trees
or other woody vegetation also facilitates the use of satellite
imagery for animal survey, since the simplified landscape provides
little cover that might obscure animals viewed from above. Finally,
the polar areas also enjoy a geographical advantage, as polar
orbiting satellites pass over the Arctic and Antarctic much more
frequently than they do areas at lower latitudes and the
development of a very high-resolution digital elevation model for
the Antarctic (Howat et al. 2019) has established in fine detail the
coastline and bare rock areas on which wildlife are likely to be
found.
Though the 30 m resolution precludes the direct census of animals,
Landsat imagery has been used to survey Adélie penguins
(Schwaller et al. 2013, Lynch & Schwaller 2014), emperor penguins
(Fretwell & Trathan 2009), and Antarctic petrels (Schwaller et al.
2018), the first two
of which are considered sentinel species for climate change and are
regularly monitored as part of international efforts for Antarctic
conservation. In the Antarctic, most of the work using sub-meter
resolution commercial imagery to estimate animal abundance has
focused on penguins (e.g., Barber-Meyer et al. 2007, Fretwell et al.
2012, Lynch et al. 2012, Lynch & LaRue 2014, LaRue et al. 2014,
Strycker et al. 2020), though crabeater seals (Gonçalves et al. 2020,
Gonçalves et al. 2022), Weddell seals (LaRue et al. 2011, LaRue et
al. 2021), fur seals (Foley 2019), and southern elephant seals
(McMahon et al. 2014, Fudala & Bialik 2022) have all been
enumerated in sub-meter commercial satellite imagery as well. Pilot
studies have demonstrated that even whales can be observed in
satellite imagery and can be detected using automated classification
models (Fretwell et al. 2014, Borowicz et al. 2019, Guirado et al.
2019).
While optical imagery has been the most promising satellite-based
technology for wildlife survey, there has been some exploration of
alternative data types. Radar imagery such as that provided by
TerraSAR-X has been explored for penguin colonies, in the hopes
that the height of penguins clustered at the colony might be
distinguishable from the background substrate. Similar hopes are
held for the newest generation of laser altimetry sensors, such as
that on NASA’s Icesat-2 satellite. While there has been some
evidence that emperor penguins might be observable in this way
(particularly during the winter when penguins are tightly packed
together), efforts to observe colonies of the smaller nest-building
species have proven unsuccessful (Mustafa et al. 2012). Thermal
infrared (TIR) imagery is another intriguing technology in the polar
regions because it seems as though seabirds and marine mammals
should be considerably warmer than their background environment
and the relative scarcity of animals in the polar regions should
minimize noise in the thermal signal. Unfortunately (in this
context), the most promising target for thermal surveying is
emperor penguins and their body surface is actually a bit cooler
than the surrounding air (McCafferty et al. 2013), and a recent
study using drone imagery found no benefit in penguin abundance
classification performance when including TIR data (Hinke et al.
2022). Though several polar species (e.g., polar bears, walrus, seals)
have been surveyed successfully using airborne thermal sensors,
satellite-based TIR imaging is captured at much lower spatial
resolution (e.g., 30 m on Landsat-8; 90 m on Terra) than optical
imagery, and this sets a very high threshold for the smallest
detectable aggregation.
Conclusions
The number of Earth-observing satellite sensors has grown rapidly
over the last several decades, and the resources available for space-
based scientific research in Antarctica is sure to grow. While
satellite-based research will not replace direct observations from
field teams working on the ground, it can complement field
observations by allowing for safer access to sites, more efficient
planning of operations, and an expanded capacity to extrapolate
field measurements to larger spatial areas. Full utilization of these
tools will benefit from continued collaboration among countries
whose assets reflect the diversity of operational capabilities and
whose strengths are highly complementary. To that end, SCAR will
continue to play a crucial role in coordinating these efforts for the
greatest benefit of the Antarctic community.
