Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia: Comparative data from fifteen
seasons
Information paper submitted by Argentina
Summary
This document presents a comparison of different aspects of tourist
flows to Antarctica via the port of Ushuaia, from summer season
2008/2009 to the last season, 2022/2023, based on the data
provided by Argentina to the ATCM for fifteen years [IP 119
(2009), IP 129 (2010), IP 20 (2011), IP 88 (2012), IP 86 (2013), IP
84 (2014), IP 126 (2015), IP 108 (2016), IP 137 (2017), IP 63
(2018), IP 63 (2018), IP 84 (2019), IP 111 (2022) and IP 106
(2023)].
Number of passengers that visited Antarctica
The number of passengers to Antarctica via the port of Ushuaia
show different variations along the fifteen seasons that were
analised. First thing to note is the significant decrease of 27 % in
the number of passengers for the 2011/2012 season, compared to
the previous one. However, in the following seasons the number of
passengers increased and continued to grow until the outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/2021. In the 2021/2022 season,
activity started to recover with few voyages, reaching the highest
figures in the history of Antarctic tourism in the last 2022/2023
season. Figure 1 shows the evolution of tourist flows and the
number of voyages over the past fifteen years (see Figure 1).

Even though this Information Paper deals with the comparison of
the past fifteen seasons, it should be noted that the 2007/2008
season showed a peak of 44,605 passengers who visited
Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia The IP 160 (2017)
submitted by Argentina presents a synthesis of the movement of
Antarctic maritime tourism through the port of Ushuaia over 60
years., number that was only reached again ten years later, in the
2017/2018 season, when a total of 43,000 passengers made the
journey. In part, the decrease that occurred after the 2007/2008
season was due to the international financial crisis.
A significant difference appears in the ratio between the number of
visitors aboard vessels that carry more than 500 passengers and
those that carry up to 500. The number of passengers aboard the
largest ships, which do not land but only navigate Antarctic waters,
has remained practically constant from the 2008/2009 to
2010/2011 seasons, only to drop notably in the following season.
This decrease began with the amendments to Annex 1 of the
MARPOL (IMO) Convention which entered in force in August 2011,
banning the use and transport of heavy fuel south of the 60º S
degrees, thus affecting large vessels, which activity dropped 75%
compared to the previous season. However, for the following season
(2012/2013), the number of passengers aboard large vessels
increased, and steadily grew until the 2019/2020 season. This type
of vessels did not make any voyages to the Antarctic Treaty Area for
two seasons due to the pandemic (2020/2021 and 2021/2022), but
their activity recovered in the 2022/2023 season, demonstrating a
relevant increase both in the number of passengers on board and in
the number of voyages (see Figure 2).

Vessels carrying up to 500 passengers showed more moderate
fluctuations, with a gradual decrease in the 2009/2010 and
2010/2011 seasons, beginning a relatively constant increase until
the 2020/2021 season when there was no movement at all. In the
2021/2022 season a total of 17,265 visitors were registered, a
65.3% decrease compared to the 2019/2020 season. Figure 3 shows
the number of visitors and voyages made by said vessels during the
period of analysis.

Number of vessels that travelled to Antarctica
Although the number of vessels varies each season, fluctuation can
be observed until the 2014/2015 season, as from the 2015/2016
season onwards there is a constant growth in the number of vessels
that make landings (except for the Covid pandemic).
On the other hand, it is interesting to note that during the last few
seasons there has been a change in the shipping fleets, as these tend
to provide greater capacity, thus allowing an increase in the
number of passengers transported. Some innovations include hybrid
power units and battery systems that facilitate navigation without
emissions and silently in sensitive areas, solar panels, advanced
systems for waste treatment, waste heat recovery systems, anti-icing
systems for bridge windows, among others. In addition, some
vessels include specific equipment such as helicopters, small
submarines and submarine remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).
Some vessels may also have hydrophones that can capture the
sounds of the sea. In this respect, vessels must comply with the
requirements derived from the Polar Code on environmental and
safety matters that came into force in 2017. Figure 4 shows the
number of vessels that operated throughout the different seasons.

Length of the seasons
In general terms, the tourist seasons present a greater extension
since the 2015/2016 season, coinciding with the increase in
voyages and passengers, except for the 2008/2009 season which
lasted 179 days.
In the first seasons of the analysed period, the departure of the
icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov marked the early beginning of
voyages in October.
Four seasons lasted more than 170 days, with the 2018/2019
season being the longest, as it extended for 180 days.
Based on the consequences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a
small dip is observed in the 2019/2020 season compared to the
previous one, since some voyages were cancelled by the end of the
season.
The 2021/2022 season is the shortest, coinciding with the lower
flow of tourists as a result of the pandemic. Figure 5 presents the
extension of the tourist seasons for the entire period of analysis.
