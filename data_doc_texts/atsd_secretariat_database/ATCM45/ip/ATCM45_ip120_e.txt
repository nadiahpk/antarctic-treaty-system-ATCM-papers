Increasing evidence of critical sea-level rise
with emissions above 1.5°C Paris agreement limit
Information Paper submitted by ASOC
Summary
Increasing published research on projected Antarctic ice sheet loss,
using ever-more sophisticated methods, points to thresholds of
irreversible sea-level rise at lower temperatures and emissions
pathways than previously considered, even within the upper 2°C
Paris Agreement limit. These studies forecast loss not only from
smaller glaciers of the Peninsula and West Antarctic Ice Sheet
(WAIS), but vulnerable sections of East Antarctica. Greater efforts
are needed to support continued monitoring and modelling, as well
as communicating this research, including at COP28 in Dubai, as
one output from the ATCM’s first Climate Day.
Introduction – Recent Developments
Beginning with its AR6 Working Group I Report (Physical Science
Basis, 2021), the IPCC raised the possibility of extreme sea-level
(SLR) rise occurring sooner, and faster than previously considered.
It found such projections sufficiently serious to include them in its
Summary for Policy Makers (SPM), despite comprising only two
very recent studies16, 44 as “high impact, low likelihood”
projections -- with the latter phrase referring however not to their
likelihood, but simply to the lack of similar studies at that time.
Since then, a growing number of these more sophisticated
modelling studies have pointed to similar results, implicating a
threshold for irreversible ice loss already around 1.8°C, with losses
becoming far more rapid between 2-3°C and once 3°C is exceeded.
Important research published just in the year since the Berlin ATCM
includes:
The East Antarctic Ice Sheet, once considered relatively stable,
could contribute substantially to sea level rise should temperatures
rise above 1.8°C1, 2.
There is increasing evidence that warming Southern Ocean waters,
and changes in ocean currents will bring warmer water to the edge
of the ice sheet and increase the rate and extent of sea-level rise
from Antarctica4,5,6,7,8,9.
Heatwaves in Antarctica continue to break records, putting ice
shelves at greater risk of collapse10.
There is increasing evidence from the paleo-climatic record that ice
sheets can collapse relatively quickly, with outlet glaciers retreating
hundreds of meters per day.11, 12
Background
Antarctica holds enough ice to raise sea level by 58 meters. The
Earth’s climate record makes clear that warming above even 1°C
over pre-industrial has resulted in very different coastlines in
Earth’s past, due to extensive melting of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet (WAIS); and by 1.5°C, possibly parts of East Antarctica1.
While some of these changes occurred very slowly, over thousands
of years, there have also been periods where extremely rapid sea
level rise (around 4 meters per century) occurred due to rapid ice
sheet collapse. Termed “melt-water pulses,” the last took place
around 14,000 years ago, when global sea levels rose between
12-18 meters in just 350 years, with ice sheets retreating up to
hundreds of meters per day11,12.
However, the observed human-induced global temperature increase
over the past few decades is much faster than anything documented
in Earth’s past. CO2 increases in the last 50 years are 200 times
greater than during the end of the last Ice Age. This means that
future rates of ice sheet loss and sea-level rise could increase even
further beyond the acceleration observed over the past few decades,
and potentially be more rapid than at any other time in the past
130,000
years13. Better understanding of ice sheet behavior, especially
interactions between the ice and the warming oceans that surround
them, informs us that ice sheet collapse and rapid sea-level rise
cannot be ruled out,14, 15, 16, 17 especially if peak warming were
to exceed 3°C.
At least parts of Antarctica have certain thresholds where
irreversible melt becomes inevitable and, in the case of the WAIS,
potentially rapid18, 19. Much of the WAIS actually rests over island
archipelagoes separated by extremely deep (>2.5 km below sea
level) and vast downward-sloping basins20, 21. As warm water
melts the marine edges of the WAIS, this exposes more of the
underside to warming waters. These processes may cause very rapid
ice sheet loss and resulting sea-level rise over just a few centuries.
In Earth’s past, several of these thresholds have occurred
somewhere between 1 and 2 degrees of warming: for the WAIS and
Antarctic Peninsula (containing around 5 meters SLR), about
1-1.5°C. Some studies indicate that the WAIS threshold for
inevitable loss already may have been passed at around 0.8°C above
pre-industrial22, 23, although its loss might be slowed to take place
over many centuries if temperatures remain close to the lower Paris
Agreement goal of 1.5°, with an aim to return below that level as
soon as possible.24
Similar conditions exist in parts of East Antarctica and have become
far better documented on the continent through coordinated
scientific efforts over the past five years, though much remains to
be learned25. Recent work also suggests that although the East
Antarctic Ice Sheet was once considered relatively stable, the ice
sheet could contribute substantially to sea level rise if temperatures
rise above 1.8°C 1, 2. Parts of East Antarctica, especially the Wilkes
and Aurora Basins (~4 meters of SLR), may have a threshold
around or just beyond 2°C1, 26.
Because of the existence of these thresholds, when temperatures
reached 2°C above pre-industrial in the Earth’s past, sea levels
peaked at around 12-20 meters higher than present-day.27 Such
extensive sea-level rise would be catastrophic for today’s coastal
communities, but we are currently on track for even higher
temperatures than those that drove sea-level rise in the past.
Antarctic sea ice and ice shelves play an important role in ice-loss
processes, as they hold back the ice sheets upstream. Loss of this
buttressing effect through ice shelf thinning and break-up can
accelerate the rate of ice flow from the land into the sea28. From
1997 to 2021, Antarctic ice shelves experienced a net area loss of
over 36,000 km2, equal to the size of the country Guinea-Bissau29.
Ice shelves have also become thinner, driven by intrusion of warmer
ocean currents30 and water ponding on the surface31. Reduced ice-
shelf buttressing could drive increasingly significant sea-level rise in
the future32, 33, 34, 35.
Ice loss from Antarctica has doubled over the past 20 years 36, 37,
38, 39, 40. For a growing number of ice sheet experts, the true
“guardrail” to prevent dangerous levels and rates of sea-level rise is
actually 1°C above pre-industrial 2, 16, 17. We are currently 1.2°C
above pre-industrial. A key argument therefore in favor of very low
emissions, is that staying close to the 1.5°C limit will allow us to
return more quickly to that 1°C level, drastically slowing global
impacts from ice sheet loss, and WAIS collapse especially 41, 42.
This will help provide low-lying nations and communities more
time to adapt through sustainable development, though some level
of managed retreat from coastlines in the long term is now
inevitable.43
However, rates of SLR from Antarctica may reach as much as 5cm a
year by 2150 should today’s emissions continue and cause
temperatures to reach 4°C above pre-industrial in 2100.44 A key
impetus for 1.5°C-consistent emissions reductions is that once ice
sheet melt accelerates due to such higher temperatures, it cannot be
stopped or reversed for many thousands of years, even once
temperatures stabilize or decrease.2, 44 Ice core and sea level
records clearly show that it takes tens of thousands of years to re-
grow an ice sheet. Sea level lowering from these new highs will not
occur until temperatures go well below pre-industrial, initiating a
slow ice sheet
re-growth.3, 45, 46, 47 Sea-level rise caused by overshoot of Paris
Agreement goals is therefore an essentially permanent impact, one
not reversible on human time scales.
The rate of future sea-level rise, and associated risks to security and
development, now largely depends on human decisions on future
emissions of greenhouse gases. To maintain the possibility of
staying below 1.5°C, CO2 emissions must be at least halved by
2030, and reduced to zero by mid-century.41, 43 Otherwise, due to
the long-term response of Antarctica, world leaders are de facto
making a decision to erase all human settlement along many
coastlines within the next few centuries, displacing hundreds of
millions of people and erasing some nations from physical land
existence.
Outputs from ATCMXVL/CEPXXV Climate Day
Given the widespread global impacts of climate change on
Antarctica and growing evidence of irreversible sea-level rise at
lower temperatures than previously projected, ASOC believes that
the ATCM should raise this science to the attention of all
governments in cooperation with ASOC, SCAR, the WMO, UNEP
and other UN bodies.
