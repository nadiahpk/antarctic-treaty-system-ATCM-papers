Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in
Ushuaia during the 2022/2023 Austral summer season
Information Paper submitted by Argentina
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and
vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2022/2023 Austral
summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. The number of
voyages, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew
per vessel, expedition staff and the registers of ships, are included
as well.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South
America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of
Antarctic ship-borne tourism since the mid-1990´s, concentrating
approximately 90% of the worldwide ship-borne Antarctic tourist
activity.
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has
contributed to facilitate Antarctic cruise ships operations through
the port of Ushuaia. In addition to the short distance between
Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, those works allowed tour
operators to extend the frequency of their Antarctic operations
during the tourist season.
Regarding Antarctic ship-borne tourism that operates from the port
of Ushuaia, we can make a clear distinction between different types
of vessels, according to their activities in the Antarctic Peninsula
area. On the one hand, vessels that make landings at different
locations; and, on the other hand, vessels of a much larger size
which only sail Antarctic waters without enabling landings.
Moreover, a further distinction can be made when looking into the
services the vessels require from the port of Ushuaia: those vessels
that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American
and Antarctic itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia’s port as
their summer base of operations. Generally, in the latter case,
operations carried out in Ushuaia involve passenger changeover,
using the city’s airport, port and maritime services, as well as the
general supply of provisions and tourist services. Finally, it should
be noted that at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic
tourist season, most vessels arrive to and/or depart from the port of
Ushuaia, and engage in positioning voyages from or towards other
destinations.
In order to present the status of tourist flows of visitors and vessels
that, through Ushuaia’s port, visited Antarctica in the 2022/2023
season, data was collected from the ship’s dispatches It refers to the
inbound and outbound clearance documentation provided by the
master of the vessel. provided to Prefectura Naval Argentina
(Argentine Coast Guard), national competent authority to that
effect, together with documents in custody at the Dirección
Provincial de Puertos (Provincial Port Authority) in Ushuaia. In
some cases, this information was compared to the itineraries
provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained
from alternate sources. Such information was used to prepare a
database for each Antarctic tourist season.
This document updates the data provided in similar papers
presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meetings since 2009, providing information that may contribute to
discussions related to Antarctic tourism.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that
operated through Ushuaia during the 2022/2023 Austral summer
season
The 2022/2023 tourist season started on October 13th when the
vessel Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions) set sail for Antarctica, and
finished on April 4th with the arrival of the vessels Sylvia Earle
(Aurora Expeditions) and Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions) to the
port of Ushuaia. There were a total of 407 voyages run by 52
vessels, including the SV Bark Europa. January was the busiest
month regarding the number of Antarctic voyages (27.76%),
followed by December (22.60%) (See Figure 1).

During the 2022/2023 season, 96,274 visitors went to Antarctica,
using Ushuaia as a connection port from and/or to the Antarctic
territory. Three passenger categories can be identified: a) those that
departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that
either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is, passengers who
went through Ushuaia only once, either on arrival or departure to
Antarctica- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way
to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports
(See Table 1). In the first case (a), only the departure of the vessels
was considered in order to count the passengers. In the second case
(b), both the passengers who arrived at, and the ones who departed
from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account, because several
vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, either
combining with other means of transport such as flight-cruise, or
visited Antarctica as part of the beginning and/or end of season
voyage, operating locally (in Ushuaia) during the rest of the season.
Finally, the last case (c) refers to vessels in transit, with passengers
that were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the case
when calling in at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. In this
regard, a distinction was made, according to the provisions of
Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting, between vessels that transported 500
passengers or less, and those that transported more than 500
passengers. Therefore, 10 vessels carried more than 500 passengers
completing 21 trips in total and transporting 34,413 passengers,
representing 35.74% of the passengers that visited Antarctica.
The average number of crew members and passengers The average
number of passengers on board is taken into account -not the
capacity of the vessel, because in some cases it could be that vessels
transport a smaller number of passengers than their total capacity.,
as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in Table
2. Figure 2 shows passenger averages per vessel.

Among the vessels in transit in Ushuaia, those that sailed through
Antarctic waters without disembarking in Antarctica are
noteworthy. As previously stated, these cruise ships completed
itineraries around the southern parts of South America, or were
involved in more extensive voyages and, on certain itineraries, they
included navigating in waters close to the Antarctic Peninsula. Most
of these vessels run “pendular” trips along Beagle Channel to
connect ports located on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and visit
Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3
provides an overview of the vessels that transported more than 500
passengers per trip, highlighting if the visit to Antarctica was before
or after the port call in Ushuaia.

voyage.

It is worth noting that the vessels Greg Mortimer, Magellan
Explorer, Ocean Adventurer, Ocean Nova, Ocean Explorer and
Sylvia Earle, operated differently than the rest of the vessels in
some voyages, as they did so directly from King George Island (Isla
25 de Mayo), South Shetland Islands (Islas Shetland del Sur),
embarking passengers that flew in and out from Punta Arenas
(Chile). Voyages that started and/or ended in Ushuaia were
considered in the count when carrying passengers, but those that
operated only with crew and staff were not.
Besides, other vessels such as the National Geographic Endurance,
Le Commandant Charcot and Ortelius made circumnavigation
voyages of the Antarctic continent between Ushuaia and Bluff (New
Zealand) in both directions according to the ship destination.

Furthermore, 32 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica
operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account
for 62% of the total number of vessels that were analyzed. Each of
these vessels made between 7 and 16 voyages to Antarctica, as
indicated in Figure 3.
Regarding visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of
Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers who made landings were
registered. In this regard, more than 100 nationalities were
identified, with most of the passengers being from the United
States, followed by Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada,
France, China, Switzerland, Netherlands, New Zealand and the
Russian Federation, among others. Percentages of the main
nationalities are represented in Figure 4, where a total of 20
nationalities account for the 95.02% of all visitors.

According to Measure 15 (2009), adopted at the XXXII Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one
guide every 20 passengers, expedition staff members included on
the crew and/or on the passenger lists, have been identified.
Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, expedition staff
members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders,
naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading
passengers during the landing activities. The only trips considered
here have been the ones made by vessels that carry 500 passengers
or less. In most voyages, expedition staff is included in the crew
manifest, followed by the passenger manifest (See Table 4). It is
worth mentioning that the expedition staff position is stated only
when they are so listed on the crew manifest.

According to the registration of the vessels that operated in
Antarctica throughout this season from Ushuaia, we observed that
among the Flag States of those vessels, four (4) are Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Parties (France, the Netherlands, Norway and United
Kingdom) and one (1) is a Non-Consultative Party (Portugal). On
the other hand, seven vessels (7) are not registered to a Party to the
Antarctic Treaty (Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Malta,
Panama and Togo) (See Figure 5).

Concluding remarks
From the gathered data, it has been possible to elaborate statistic
information allowing for the identification of the vessels that
operated in Antarctica using the port of Ushuaia, during the
2022/2023 season, the number of trips made, the number of
passengers and their nationalities, the average of crew members per
vessel, the expedition staff and the countries where the ships are
registered.
The development of this season shows a significant increase in the
number of vessels, voyages and number of passengers. Taking the
2019/2020 season as a reference, as it was barely influenced by the
COVID-19 pandemic, the total number of passengers who have
visited Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia increased by 40.83%.
Voyages rose 29.61%.
The number of voyages made by larger vessels that only navigate
Antarctic waters has increased to 21 trips made by ten vessels,
transporting 34,413 passengers; showing 84.73% more passengers
than the reference season 2019/2020.
The data herein presented aims to contribute, as an alternative and
complementary source, in the assessment of tourism in the
Antarctic Peninsula region, with special emphasis on those tourist
vessels that call in at the port of Ushuaia.
