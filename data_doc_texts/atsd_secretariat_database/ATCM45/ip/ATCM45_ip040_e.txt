Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in
2022-23
Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in
2022-23
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina,
Chile, United States and the International Association of Antarctica
Tour Operators (IAATO)
Summary
This paper consolidates information from the United Kingdom,
Argentina, Chile, United States and IAATO relating to yachts
sighted in Antarctica, or indicating an intention to travel to
Antarctica, during the 2022-23 season.
Background
The ATCM has previously welcomed information about yachts
sighted in, or planning to travel to, Antarctica. This has enabled
Parties to consider the overall volume of yachts known to be
visiting the continent, and to confirm whether appropriate
authorisations for such activities had been obtained.
Since 2010, the United Kingdom and IAATO have provided reports
to the ATCM about the number of yachts sighted in the Antarctic
during each previous season, while Argentina has provided reports
detailing yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia. From 2016
to 2021 Chile, Argentina, the United Kingdom and IAATO presented
a joint paper (ATCM XXXIX/WP34, ATCM XL/WP19, ATCM XLI/
IP55, ATCM XLII/IP107 and ATCM XLIII/IP054). In 2022, Chile,
Argentina, the United Kingdom, IAATO and the United States
presented a joint paper (ATCM XLIV/IP080 rev.1).
As in previous years, this paper includes information collected as
part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and
vessels) at the UK-operated base Port Lockroy; information from
Argentina on yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia and
yachts observed from Brown Station; information provided by Chile
based on details recorded from yachts indicating an intention to
travel from Puerto Williams/Punta Arenas to Antarctica; and
incidental sightings recorded by IAATO members and other vessels
in Antarctica. The paper also includes information from the United
States on yachts observed from Palmer Station. It would be helpful
if Parties could provide any supplementary material, which adds to
or verifies this information.
A total of 42 yachts were sighted in, or reported an intention to sail
to, Antarctica during the 2022-23 season. This represents the same
number as reported in the 2021-2022 season. 15 of these were
IAATO members (table 1); 19 were non-IAATO members but had
Party authorisation to travel to Antarctica (table 2); and 8 vessels
appear to the cosponsors to be unauthorised vessels (table 3).
Parties are reminded that the EIES contains a summarised reporting
tool, which can generate a complete list of all vessels included in
pre-season information as having obtained authorisation to operate
in Antarctica (https://www.ats.aq/devAS/InformationExchange/
SummarizedReports?lang=e). This facility makes it much easier to
determine whether a yacht is authorised, and consequently, this
may be a useful tool for use in-season to expedite the verification of
the authorisation status of any sighted yachts. Parties are therefore
requested to ensure that the EIES is updated regularly to include all
authorised tourism vessels.
Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom,
Argentina, Chile, United States and IAATO believe that it is
important that the ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting
activities in Antarctica and encourages Parties to share information
about yachts they have authorised through the EIES Pre-Season
Information facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with
Resolution 10 (2021). We would also point to the continued activity
of yachts that have been operating in the region without
authorisation from a Treaty Party. We urge the ATCM to consider
further the matter of unauthorised yachts.
