IAATO Deep Field and Air Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2022-23
Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24 Season
IAATO Overview of Deep Field and Air Tourism: A Historical
Review of Growth, the 2022–23 Season, and Preliminary Estimates
for 2023-24
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide the statistical data compiled from Deep
Field and Air Operator Post Visit Reports for the 2022-23 season
and the preliminary estimates for 2023-24 season as of 01 May,
2023.
We take this opportunity to build on discussions with different
Treaty Parties around growth and diversification of Deep Field and
Air activities, by including some historical perspective which may
aid ongoing considerations. The data presented throughout this
paper are based on information provided to IAATO by its Operators
in Post Visit Reports. Visitor numbers reflect only those travelling
with IAATO Operator companies and do not include Observers,
Government Officials, or those individuals taking part in research
projects that are being supported by Deep Field Operators. It does
not include information from any non-IAATO operators, nor does it
include information about IAATO Operator support of National
Antarctic Programs (NAPs).
It should be noted at the outset that the worldwide SARS CoV-2
pandemic has had a significant impact on Antarctic private sector
travel and consequently the numbers reported in this paper.
Specifically, we draw attention to the fact that:
During the 2020-2021 season, there were no IAATO Deep Field and
Air Operations, although some National Antarctic Program Support
was given by IAATO Operators, following COMNAP and NAP
COVID-19 Protocols. As this was not a representative season for
IAATO the 2020-2021 data has been omitted from overall
deliberations in this paper.
During the 2021-2022 season there was a resumption of activities
however visitor numbers remained depressed.
IAATO’s Deep Field and Air Operators encompass all of the private-
sector tour operators. Operator activities are permitted or
authorized through Environmental Impact Assessments, Advance
Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management Permits, and
submitted in advance of the season.
All Deep Field and Air activities, that follow ATCM, COMNAP and
IAATO policies and guidelines, have been authorised and conducted
on expeditions since the 1990’s. Regular deep field activities
commenced towards the end of the 1980s, although there were
exceptional one-off expeditions prior to this period, e.g. Transglobe
Expedition (1980–81); In the Footsteps of Scott (1984–1987).
IAATO Operators conduct their operations in a safe and
environmentally responsible manner, and all activities are planned
to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic
environment.
1.0 IAATO Member Nationalities
Reflecting on the latest period of growth, the Post Visit Reports
submitted to IAATO indicate the top 10 nationalities who visited
Antarctica (vessel and deep field) have remained relatively
consistent over the last ten seasons, although proportionately and
prior to the pandemic, China had seen the greatest increase in
travelers to Antarctica. During the 2023-24 season Chinese
visitors are expected to return in pre-pandemic numbers. An
overview of the last 10 years can be found in Figure 2.

2.0 IAATO Deep Field and Air Operations Overview
This section focuses on IAATO Deep Field and Air Operations.

and Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24 Season.
2.1 IAATO Deep Field and Air Operators
IAATO members currently include four Operators who conduct
deep field and air tourism activities, and one air Operator that
supports air-cruise operations and single- or multi-day Antarctic
experiences in the South Shetland Islands.
Table 2 provides an overview of Deep Field and Air Operators
primary areas of seasonal operation/base camp. Deep Field
Operators also utilise seasonal satellite field camps and runways for
their different activities and flights. Figure 3 provides a pictorial
view of the areas of operation. Figure 4 gives an overview of the
deep field and air client numbers for the last decade. Table 3 offers
additional information about Deep Field and Air activities.

Figure 3: Deep Field and Air Areas of Operation
Figure 4: Deep Field and Air Operator Clients 2012-2022 (excluding
2020-21)
Deep Field and Air Operators usually maintain a higher client to
staff ratio than is typical for seaborne tourism, often one guide to
every three clients (1:3). The exception is solo expeditions, for
example during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are
supported remotely and closely monitored daily through
communication protocols. All Deep Field and Air Operators prepare
contingency plans for the health, safety, medical care and
evacuation for their staff and clients to meet ATCM Resolutions 6
(2017) Guidelines on Contingency Planning and 6 (2021) Air Safety
in Antarctica.
IAATO Air Operators comply fully with ATCM Measure 4 (2004)
Insurance and Contingency Planning for Tourism and Non-
Governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area (updated by
Resolution 6, 2017), and each Operators’ air activities are planned
to have the appropriate contingency in place to effect search and
rescue and medical evacuation.
2.2 Deep Field and Air Operator Programs and Activities
The last five seasons’ activities, including the operation of standard
programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions,
and logistical support of other expeditions, are outlined in Table 3:
Programs and Participant Numbers (clients) for 2017-22. Total
numbers participating include clients from all five IAATO Deep
Field and Air Operators. Note that some clients participated in
multiple programs. Most activities detailed below have been offered
consistently since the 1990s and have not changed during this latest
period of growth. Activities for air Operator DAP Antarctica are
listed for seasons 2018-2022, reporting on their activities since
becoming an IAATO Member.
