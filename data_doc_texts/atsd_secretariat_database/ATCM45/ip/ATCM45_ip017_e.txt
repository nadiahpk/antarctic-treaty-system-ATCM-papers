Gender Perspective and Actions in the Antarctic Scientific
Expedition of the Chilean Antarctic Institute
Summary
The actions implemented in the Antarctic Scientific Expedition
organised by the Chilean Antarctic Institute are described in order
to advance towards equality between men and women and offer
safe spaces, free of violence and discrimination.
Background
Since 2019, the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) has been
formally mainstreaming the gender perspective in its scope of
action, through the establishment of commitments that have been
incorporated into the regional gender and ministerial agendas,
which seek to advance towards equality and reduce existing
inequities, barriers and gaps, especially in the area of science and
the world of work.
The first INACH Gender Agenda (2019-2022) focused on the
collection of information, the analysis of the dynamics that exist in
the scientific community, the incorporation of the gender approach
in communications and the promotion of an organisational culture
in based on equality between people and part of the results were
previously reported in IP 43 of ATCM XLIII (2021).
As a result of this work, a high segmentation by sex was evidenced
in the choice of careers and that less than a third of those who
study STEM careers (science, technology, engineering and
mathematics) are women; the flight of female talent throughout
their professional development; the low representation of women in
leadership positions; that throughout life gender biases and
stereotypes are assimilated and accumulated that can limit the
development of people in their areas of interest and; that in the
scientific career there is a higher prevalence of harassment towards
women, increased questioning of their family or personal
environment, and they are more frequently the object of sexist
practices and comments.
Science, and Antarctic science, are not exempt from the
reproduction of violent and sexist behaviours, which is why the
INACH has implemented a series of measures that seek to ensure
that the Antarctic Scientific Expedition (ASE) offer safe spaces, free
of violence and discrimination through awareness and prevention
actions that promote good treatment, to consolidate a culture of full
respect for the dignity of people.
Actions
Code of Conduct: document that seeks to report the expected
behaviour of the people who participate in the Antarctic Scientific
Expedition, emphasising dignified and respectful treatment and
professional and ethical behaviour. It includes a special section to
define abuse, workplace and sexual harassment, recommendations
for their prevention and instructions on how to proceed if one is a
victim or witness of inappropriate behaviour. In addition, the
sanctions that may entail the commission of actions contrary to the
code are made explicit.
Procedure for the prevention and punishment of mistreatment,
workplace and sexual harassment: Work was done on updating the
procedure with the aim of incorporating all the activities organised
or managed by the INACH (Chilean Antarctic Institute) within its
scope and establishing that the headquarters of our Antarctic bases
or other platforms can act as recipients of complaints.
Personnel selection procedure for logistics activities: The selection
procedure was updated by introducing a labour-psychological
evaluation within the requirements to fill the positions. In addition,
it was defined that the composition of the logistics personnel be
equal.
Clothing and personal protection elements: The number of extra-
small and extra-large size garments, technical clothing for women,
as well as anti-exposure suits in different sizes was increased in the
inventory for the purpose that each person has access to the
appropriate clothing to carry out their work and their labour-
related dignity.
Induction for ACE participants: Two modules were added to the
compulsory face-to-face induction programme:
INACH for Good Treatment (40 minutes): The Code of Conduct is
made known, recognising behaviours associated with good
treatment and examples of how and when it is applied during the
expedition; likewise, it specifies actions contrary to it, granting
definitions of discrimination, abuse, workplace and sexual
harassment.
Regarding the prevention of workplace bullying, guidelines for its
prevention are provided based on the awareness that an attitude
that does not cause discomfort to one person can be threatening to
another, in the characteristics of consent and the guideline to ask
and respect. Exercises are carried out based on stories that help
recognise inappropriate attitudes and, together, more appropriate
solutions are sought to face situations related to sexual affectivity.
Finally, it is invited to reflect by showing a short list of situations
that participants from previous expeditions have reported as
uncomfortable, unsafe or threatening and they are invited to avoid
these behaviours and to channel reports with the base headquarters
when they occur, to carry out the corrective actions that are
necessary to restore the spaces of coexistence.
Procedure for the prevention of abuse, workplace and sexual
harassment (25 minutes): It explains what the procedure for
reporting and investigating consists of, the reception channels
available, the reporting forms and where to find them, the
prevention measures to be expected in case of events of this nature,
and the penalties that may be applied.
Preliminary results
During the Antarctic Scientific Expedition 2022-2023 (ASE-59) 45%
of the persons who formed the teams for logistics activities were
women and the scope of the mandatory induction was 200 people,
including logistics personnel, investigators, the media and guests,
who declared that they knew and accepted the code of conduct.
With these actions, the INACH has made explicit the expected
behaviour of those who participate in the ASE and its institutional
response; this has allowed people to use the available
communication channels more frequently in the face of
inappropriate behaviour, and the reaction to complaints of
workplace, and the spaces for coexistence have been re-established
in a more optimal way.
Conclusions
Implementing actions to promote gender equality and offering safe
spaces, free of violence and discrimination, should be elementary
considerations when planning and developing our activities,
particularly those in Antarctica.
The generation of these processes makes it possible to obtain
systematised information, useful for decision-making and to
improve prevention and response, making our tools to deal with
inappropriate behaviour more robust.
We encourage all Parties to implement actions in these matters and
to share their experiences and results.
