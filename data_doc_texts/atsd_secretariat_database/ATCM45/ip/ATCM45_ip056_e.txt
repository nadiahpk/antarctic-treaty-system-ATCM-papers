IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: The 2022-23 Season, and
Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24
IAATO Overview of Antarctic Vessel Tourism: The 2022-23 Season,
and Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide the statistical data compiled from Post
Visit Reports for the 2022-23 season and the preliminary estimates
for 2023-24 season as of 01 May, 2023.
It should be noted at the outset that the worldwide SARS-CoV-2
pandemic has had a significant impact on Antarctic private sector
travel and consequently the historical numbers reported in this
paper. Specifically, we draw attention to the fact that:
During the 2020-2021 season, and the height of the pandemic, only
two yachts and 15 visitors operated in the Peninsula area. As this
was not a representative season for IAATO the 2020-2021 data has
been omitted from overall reporting in this paper.
During the 2021-2022 season there was a resumption of activities
however these numbers remained depressed as some Operators took
the difficult decision not to operate. Furthermore, as Omicron
became prevalent, others chose to cancel expeditions or curtail their
season. Lastly, in many cases, Operators also had lower occupancy
as fewer clients travelled.
We also take this opportunity to build on discussions with different
Treaty Parties around growth and diversification of activities, by
including a historical perspective which may aid ongoing
considerations. The data presented throughout this paper is based
on information provided to IAATO by its Operators in Post Visit
Reports (PVRs). Visitor numbers reflect only those travelling with
IAATO Operator companies and do not include Observers,
Government Officials, or those individuals taking part in research
projects that are being supported by IAATO Operators. It also does
not include information from any non-IAATO operators.
IAATO’s membership continues to encompass the majority of
private-sector tour operators. IAATO Operator activities are
permitted or authorized through Environmental Impact
Assessments, Advance Notifications and, where relevant, Waste
Management Permits, and submitted in advance of the season.
Nearly all activities, which follow ATCM and IAATO policies and
guidelines, have been authorized and conducted on expeditions for
more than two decades, and in many cases since the beginning of
Antarctic tourism circa the 1960’s. IAATO Operators conduct their
operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and
all activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory
impact on the Antarctic environment.
1.0 Historical Overview on Managing for Growth
1.1 IAATO Member Activities and Managing for Growth
The growth of the Antarctic tourism industry is a topic of great
interest within the Antarctic and worldwide communities. In past
three decades, IAATO has seen two other periods of growth - once
during the mid-1990s and then again in the period 2003-2008.
During each of these periods of growth, and in the intervening
break, IAATO has implemented a series of tourism management
measures, many of which were subsequently adopted by the ATCPs.
With advancements in technology, reporting and communications,
and building on lessons learned in the past, IAATO has been able to
accurately forecast and monitor growth, making measured
decisions and advancements to properly position the organization
as changes happen, and be fleet of foot to respond as appropriate.
As forecasted, the 2022-23 activity levels exceeded pre-pandemic
rates. Anticipating this and the continued increase in numbers of
passengers and vessels, IAATO continues to strengthen, test, and
refine its suite of ‘tools’ to ensure the continued successful
management of activities.
In this current period of tourism growth, there is an opportunity for
all Antarctic Stakeholders to work together to continue evolving a
pragmatic approach to tourism management – this was
demonstrated at the recent Paris Workshop, March 8-10, 2023,
“The future of Antarctic tourism: time to adopt a common vision
and to build a basic policy program.” IAATO looks forward to
continued communication and collaboration around tourism
management.
Incremental changes on existing tools have been made during the
past ten years to address the continued increase in activities.
Figures 1.1 – 1.3 give an overview of some of the key growth
management tools introduced by IAATO during three periods of
growth between 1993-Present.

response to growth between 1993 and 2001
Figure 1.2: Examples of IAATO management tools introduced in
response to growth between 2001 and 2011
Figure 1.3: IAATO management tools introduced in response to
growth between 2011 – Present
1.2 IAATO Member Nationalities
Reflecting on the latest period of growth, 2014-2022, the Post Visit
Reports submitted to IAATO indicate the top 10 nationalities who
visited Antarctica have remained relatively consistent over the last
ten seasons, although proportionately and prior to the pandemic,
China had seen the greatest increase in travelers to Antarctica. An
overview of the last 10 years can be found in Figure 2.

2.0 IAATO Vessel Operations Overview
This section focuses on IAATO Vessel Operations, and includes
yacht activities.
For Deep Field and Air Operator information please refer to ATCM
XLV IP057 IAATO Deep Field and Air Overview of Antarctic
Tourism: 2022-23 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2023-24
Season.
2.1 IAATO Vessel Activities
For the last 31 years shipborne tourism on the Peninsula has been
the dominant vector of travel. The vast majority of tourism voyages
(98%) operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the seven-
month austral summer season (from October to April), and depart
from Ushuaia, Argentina or, to a lesser extent, from other ports
north of the Antarctic Treaty Area.
During the 2022-23 season, two non-IAATO cruise only Operators
conducted activities in Antarctica. Both Operators were authorized/
permitted, and collaborated on SAR information with IAATO. One
of these non-IAATO Operators was voted in as a Provisional
Operator at the 2023 IAATO annual meeting. To the best of our
knowledge, all other commercial SOLAS passenger ship Operators
conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area are
members of IAATO.
Table 1. offers a summary of the last decade 2012-13 –2022-23) of
both IAATO SOLAS and non-SOLAS vessel tourism (including
Yachts and Cruise Only).

In accordance with IAATO Bylaws Article X – Section B, all
Operators and Provisional Operators are to comply with operational
conditions pursuant to the Antarctic Treaty System, including the
Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
the Antarctic Treaty, along with IMO Conventions and similar
international and national laws and agreements.
2.2 Scope of IAATO Vessel Activities
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small
inflatable boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.),
shore landings, and to a lesser extent activity such as, but not
limited to, kayaking, climbing, and short overnight stays.
Through the years descriptions and the type of activities have been
expanded in the Post Visit Reports to facilitate greater accuracy for
reporting and planning. For instance, RPAS Flights, although
banned recreationally in coastal waters by IAATO, has been
expanded to differentiate between commercial, scientific, and
operational/navigation flights. Likewise, what was once described
as swimming, has now been expanded to swimming – distance and
polar plunge.
Representing the current expansion of descriptions during this last
period of growth, Figure 3 illustrates activities offered by IAATO
vessels including yachts, during the 2022-2023 season. Small boat
cruising and landings remain the most popular activities (49%) for
vessels, while scenic ship cruising also remains a key activity. A
range of other activities (e.g., kayaking, and
short overnight stays) contribute to a smaller portion (8%) of off-
ship activities. It is anticipated that ship cruising, small boat
cruising and small boat landings will continue to be the dominant
activities and other activities will remain small scale in comparison.
For more information on IAATO Operator activities see ATCM XLII
IP145 A Catalogue of IAATO Operator Activities.
