Monitoring and eradication of a non-native grass, Poa annua, from
the Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South
Shetland Islands - 2022/2023 update
Summary
This report provides information on the monitoring and progress of
eradication of the non-native grass Poa annua within the west coast
of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, during the 2022/2023
season.
Background
The non-native grass Poa annua L. was accidentally introduced at
the Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station (hereafter Arctowski) during
the 1980s. Its presence was initially recorded in the austral summer
of 1985/86, first in sites disturbed by human activities, later on the
deglaciated moraines of Ecology Glacier, within ASPA No. 128
Western Shore of Admiralty Bay. In 2014-2017, a research program
entitled “The causes, course and consequences of the expansion of
Poa annua L. in Western Antarctica, a multi-aspect population
study” was conducted, a component of which was regular
eradication of P. annua from Point Thomas Oasis and ASPA no. 128.
The last individuals of non-native plants within ASPA no. 128 were
recorded and eradicated in the 2015/2016 season, and since then,
individuals of the non-native grass were recorded only in the Point
Thomas Oasis, encompassing the Arctowski infrastructure. In the
2018/2019 season, monitoring and eradication of P. annua became
part of the complex non-native species monitoring carried out by
Environmental Observers at Arctowski.
In accordance with Annex II of the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, as well as the CEP non-native
species manual and the Management Plan of ASPA No. 128,
measures to eradicate P. annua from the area were taken. Progress
was reported at the ATCM XXXVIII/CEP XVIII (IP78), ATCM
XXXIX/CEP XIX (IP60), ATCM XL/CEP XX (IP47), ATCM XLII/CEP
XXII (IP150) and ATCM XLIII/CEP XXIII (IP89) meetings.
Follow-up activities taken in the 2022/2023 season
Point Thomas Oasis
In the summer season of 2022/2023, the vicinity of the Arctowski
Station was thoroughly checked for the presence of tussocks and
seedlings of P. annua. With the Arctowski redevelopment underway
in 2022/2023 and the risk of spreading soil material containing P.
annua propagules associated with the works, monitoring in the
Point Thomas Oasis has intensified. During the period of
30.11.2022–14.03.2023, 18 eradication events were carried out,
resulting in the removal of 4,707 individuals of P. annua, which
were mostly in the early stages of development. Eradication was
carried out in accordance with the methods used in the multi-year
research program “The causes, course and consequences of the
expansion of Poa annua L. in Western Antarctica, a multi-aspect
population study” (Galera et al. 2016). Removal was conducted by
hand by trained environmental observers, ensuring that native plant
species were not disturbed. Each tussock was dug up with the roots
and surrounding soil. All of the material was incinerated. Each site
was photographed, and the GPS location was recorded.
To minimize the risk of spreading seeds deposited in seed banks,
zones were designated for the movement of construction machinery,
and all station staff and construction workers were trained in
methods to prevent the spread of material outside the station
infrastructure zone.
ASPA No. 128
Inspections of ASPA no. 128 were conducted in 2022/2023 by two
environmental observers. The inspections did not indicate the
presence of P. annua. Monitoring, both around Arctowski and in
ASPA no. 128, will be continued during the next Antarctic season.
