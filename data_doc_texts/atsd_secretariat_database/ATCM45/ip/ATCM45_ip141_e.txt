National Measures on Antarctic Legislation
Abstract
The aim of the Indian Antarctic Act, 2022 is to provide for national
measures for protecting the Antarctic environment and dependent
and associated ecosystems and to give effect to the Antarctic Treaty,
the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty. In the Act, provisions are made for the penalty for
contravention of certain activities, involving a person, vessel or
aircraft.
Introduction
India signed the Antarctic Treaty on the 19th of August, 1983 and
in due course was accorded the status of a consultative party on the
12th of September, 1983. Further, on the 17th of June, 1985 India
ratified the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources (CCAMLR) and became a member of the
Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
Finally, India signed the Madrid Protocol which came into force on
the 14th of January, 1998.
According to Article 13 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection
to Antarctica Treaty, it is incumbent upon each State Party to
undertake appropriate measures as may be within its competence,
including the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative
actions and enforcement measures, to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this Protocol. Since India has provisions for the
protection of the environment in its Constitution, it is imperative to
have its national measures that ensure the protection of the
Antarctic environment along with its dependent and associated
ecosystem
The need to establish a regulatory framework for the management
of various Indian activities in Antarctica in consonance with its
obligations under various instruments of the Antarctic Treaty
System made it necessary to promulgate the Indian Antarctic Act,
2022. This Act assented to by the Honâ€™ble President of India on 6th
August 2022after passing by the Parliament.
