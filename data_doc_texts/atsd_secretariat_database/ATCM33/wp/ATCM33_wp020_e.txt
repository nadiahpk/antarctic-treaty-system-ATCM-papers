Forwarding of recommendations on operational matters to COMNAP
Introduction
The Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty is currently engaged in the process of reviewing the recommendations approved by previous Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) on operational matters, environmental issues and Protected Areas and Monuments. The aim of this exercise is to produce new or revised versions of the documents in question with a view to preparing the ATCM’s decisions on recommendations that are no longer in effect (ATCM XXXII SP 4 Draft Secretariat Programme 2009-2010).
One of the functions of COMNAP is to provide technical assistance to the Antarctic Treaty System, particularly with respect to operational matters, given the longstanding experience its working groups have in this field; the importance of COMNAP was also explicitly stated in Resolution 2 (2009) Role and Place of COMNAP in the Antarctic Treaty System. As a result, it would be appropriate to request COMNAP’s assistance when evaluating the status of the recommendations on operational matters.  
The Secretariat Paper ATCM XXXIII SP 9 Analysis of the status of ATCM recommendations establishes that once it has been determined which recommendations have been replaced by later recommendations adopted by the ATCM and COMNAP guidelines, the ATCM can decide whether they should be replaced by decisions or resolutions recommending the Parties’ compliance based on COMNAP’s report.
