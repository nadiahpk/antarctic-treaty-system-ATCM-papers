Queen Maud Land – a new center of non-governmental activity in the Antarctic




Queen Maud Land – a new center of non-governmental activity in the Antarctic
In August 2003 in Brest (France) after the COMNAP meeting, representatives of the NAPs of Belgium, Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Finland, Sweden, RSA and Japan (later joined by India) have signed the main provisions and scope of work of the international aviation program in the Queen Maud Land area “The Dronning Maud Land Air Network” (DROMLAN). The DROMLAN Program provides aviation support on a corporate financial basis for the aforementioned national Antarctic expeditions, operating on the Queen Maud Land and in the adjoining territories. Transcontinental flights are carried out from Cape Town to Antarctica to the ice airfields of Russian Novolazarevskaya and Norwegian Troll stations. Inland flights are made by BT-67“Basler” and “Twin Otter” aircraft with ski-wheel landing gear. Transcontinental flights to Novo are made in November-December and in February-early March of each Antarctic season. In January, the flights are stopped, due to melting of the airstrip surface. The airstrip of Troll is suitable for landings and takeoffs of heavy transport wheel aircraft of IL-76ТD type without interruptions. The DROMLAN aviation support was periodically requested by the NAPs of Argentina, Italy and China. A total of 68 transcontinental flights from Cape Town to Antarctica were made from December 2001 to February 2010 with more than 5,109 passengers transported to and from Antarctica to Cape Town. The passengers included participants of NAPs, national inspection teams, Heads of the States, Governments and Ministries, members of parliaments of countries-participants to the Antarctic Treaty, journalists and well-known businessmen.

As agreed with all program participants, a private company from the RSA “Antarctic Logistic Center International” (ALCI), Cape Town, has become air operator of the DROMLAN Program. It is registered in RSA, meeting fully the legislative and financial requirements of this country in its activity. ALCI charters required aircraft, flight crews and ground technical teams in different countries, deals with problems of aircraft ramps and refueling in the airports, their flights from permanent locations to operating areas. Its activity also includes receiving, warehousing and customs clearance of NAPs’ cargo, accommodation of passengers, provision of meals and climatic clothing during their stay at the Novo airfield camp, support of ground services at the Novo airfield, including aircraft refueling, accommodation of crews and passengers, provision with different radio- and satellite communication and aircraft loading-unloading operations. Preparation and maintenance of the runway, receiving of aviation fuel from ships and its delivery to the airfield from the ice barrier is provided by RAE personnel. Meteorological support of inland flights in Antarctica is provided by the German Antarctic Georg von Neumayer station. Receiving inland flights at the Antarctic stations and seasonal field bases, including refueling is carried out by NAPs’ personnel at these stations and bases. 
The DROMLAN Program holds annually two meetings, where in April-May the results of the Antarctic season are summarized and preliminary plans for the next season are exchanged. The program air operator, ALCI Company, submits its detailed financial report on the completed season. All final official applications for the next Antarctic season are accepted by ALCI until 1 August and in the end of August after processing they are disseminated to applicants in the framework of plan-schedules of transcontinental and inland flights with costs of individual airfare for a transcontinental flight and cost of delivery of 1 kg of cargo. The cost of transcontinental flights is determined from the plan flight duration along the given route taking into account return to the base point in the absence of order for such return flight. The pre-seasonal DROMLAN meeting is held in October, and final plans of air operations for the forthcoming season are made.
In November 2004, as commissioned by RAE, a fuel paradrop by IL-76ТD aircraft to Vostok station under DROMLAN was made. This operation has significantly expanded technical capabilities of DROMLAN enabling aviation support to different inland operations for delivering fuel and spares for transport vehicles using such technology.
Organization of a constantly operating air bridge between South Africa and the Queen Maud Land and possibilities of inland air operations have attracted attention of NGO of different countries dealing with support of exploratory and adventure tourism in the Antarctic. One of such companies was “The Antarctic Company” (TAC) registered in Cape Town and operating according to RSA legislation similar to ALCI. In June 2009, ТАС has joined the IAATO, which in November 2009 sent its inspectors to Novo for acquainting with TAC activity in the Antarctic.
In total beginning from the 2006–07 season, airplanes charted by ALCI for DROMLAN support have transported to Antarctica and back 195 tourists: 28 in 2006-07, 39 in 2007-08, 56 in 2008-09 and 72 in 2009-10. The events organized and held by ТАС in the season of 2009-10 include: 
    • Sky diving expedition (Russia);
    • Frederik Paulsen Expedition (Sweden, France, Germany and Russia);
    • Austrian Antarctic expedition;
    • French Mountaineering Expedition;
    • One day trip to Antarctica by Boeing В-727 (RSA, Great Britain, Switzerland, Russia);
    • White desert, Ltd. (Great Britain);
    • Zavod Projekt Atol (Slovenia).
Flights of tourists and participants of different non-governmental expeditions to Antarctica using aircraft charted for DROMLAN allowed ALCI to reduce airfare prices for the Cape Town– Novo – Cape Town route for program participants, and no DROMLAN participant had official objections against such arrangement. At the same time the international community has an opinion that this non-governmental activity in the Queen Maud Land area is carried out with RAE support. 
The Russian Delegation at ATCM has repeatedly stated that RAE is not implicated in organizing this kind of activity, but this stereotype still exists. In August 2009 in Punta-Arenas (Chile) at DROMLAN meeting, RAE has again raised the problem of official attitude of all DROMLAN participants to using national expedition infrastructures at the Queen Maud Land by non-governmental operators. This proposal was not supported again on the grounds that this is a private RAE practice with the NGO of other countries. It is of interest that state authorities of some DROMLAN countries issue permits for non-governmental activities of their citizens or legal entities at the Queen Maud Land not giving consent to use their own national Antarctic stations or seasonal field bases as starting sites of such non-governmental expeditions. Some of these countries rendering in fact a real support for the non-governmental activity to their citizens and legal entities express officially within the ATCM framework a negative attitude to development of non-governmental activity in the Antarctic region. This makes it possible to apply double standards in the issues regarding development of activity of the international Antarctic community. 
After Protocol ratification by the RF, special procedures for issuing permits for Antarctic activity to Russian citizens and legal entities were established. They cannot naturally apply to citizens of other countries or foreign NGO and Russia cannot officially prohibit any non-governmental activity undertaken at the Russian expedition infrastructure facilities. No such procedure exists up to now in RSA, so the activity of ALCI and TAC companies in Antarctica is not regulated. It is clear that simultaneous arrival of 70-80 passengers onboard IL-76ТD to the Novo ice airfield from Cape Town produces additional environmental impact in the airfield area, but this impact has never been evaluated. 
Russia issues official permits for ice airfield operations at Novo and intercontinental flights of the Russian crews of IL-76ТD in the Antarctic. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of this activity considers a technogenous impact (aircraft, loading-unloading vehicles, fuel trucks, etc.), rather than the impact of flight passengers – participants of foreign Antarctic governmental and non-governmental programs. To eliminate this gap, ALCI plans in 2010 before the new summer season to prepare a separate EIA for this activity carried out in the airfield camp of Novo. 
Realization and development of non-governmental activity on Queen Maud Land using DROMLAN has strict logistical restrictions. Further increase of transcontinental flights to Antarctica is connected with using additional transport vessel for aviation fuel shipping to the ice barrier of Novo and significant increase of ground transport fleet for its delivery to the ice airfield. Neither RAE nor ALCI have such capabilities. At the same time DROMLAN participants are seriously concerned with keeping prices down for air transportation from Cape Town to Antarctica and back. An increase of non-governmental activity provides the required support for addressing this economical problem. The Parties should make these decisions not by tacit agreement but on condition of mutual consent. It can be achieved if the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty participating in DROMLAN officially coordinate this type of activity with national operators, owners of the Antarctic expedition infrastructure before issuing their national permits for non-governmental activity, based on the infrastructure of other NAPs.
