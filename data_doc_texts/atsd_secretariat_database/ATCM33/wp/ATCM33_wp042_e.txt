Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guidelines for Seabee Hook, Cape Hallett, 
Northern Victoria Land, Ross Sea
Working Paper submitted by the United States
(Working with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators – IAATO)

Cape Hallett has attracted tourist visits since at least the 1970s because of its outstanding scenery, the presence of a large penguin colony on Seabee Hook (~64,000 pairs 2009-10), the interest in the former Hallett Station (NZ / US), and its comparative accessibility on the northern coast of Victoria Land. Tourist visits to Cape Hallett have, however, generally been at a low level, with visits carefully managed. The total number of tourists visiting Cape Hallett in recent years has been 521 in 2005-06, zero in 2006-07 and 2007-08 and 270 in 2008-09 (IAATO data, accessed Feb 2010).
Cape Hallett is also a site of considerable biological and scientific interest, and Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 106 Cape Hallett (at 170°13'25" E, 72°19'11" S) was originally designated in 1966 (as SPA No. 7) for an area of rich and diverse terrestrial ecology. In 2002 the boundaries of ASPA No. 106 were expanded to include the substantial Adélie penguin colony because of its significant scientific interest related to recolonization of the site of the former Hallett Station. The Management Plan of ASPA No. 106 allowed for controlled tourist visits to the Area within a Managed Zone, which extended around the coastline of Seabee Hook and encompassed former station areas.
A revised Management Plan for ASPA No. 106 was submitted by the United States for consideration by the Parties in 2008 (ATCM XXXI/WP013). This draft proposed a reconfiguration of the ASPA boundary and a deletion of the Managed Zone, proposing instead that tourist visits be managed using ‘Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guidelines’, the concept for which had recently been agreed by the Parties (Resolution 5 (2005)). However, this draft plan and the associated Visitor Site Guidelines for Seabee Hook could not be adopted because of the definition of boundaries as proposed. As a result, the United States undertook a field visit in November – December 2009 specifically to address these concerns and more generally to gather up-to-date information on the area.
The recent field visit carried out an accurate survey of both the coastline and the 2009 extent of Adélie penguin breeding areas in order to define a fixed protected area boundary and to assess whether areas existed that would be suitable for continued tourist visits. In addition, consideration was given to responses received in consultations with the scientific community and with national programs operating in the area. 
Following these extensive analyses and consultations, the Management Plan for ASPA No. 106 has been substantially revised, and is being submitted for consideration at the XXXIII ATCM (2010; WPxxx). As a part of this process, two separate areas on Seabee Hook were assessed as suitable for continued tourist access such that the values for which ASPA No. 106 was designated would not be compromised. It was concluded that Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guidelines represented the most appropriate framework for management of continued tourist activities, which would take place outside of the ASPA.
The two Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guide areas identified are located on the northern and northwestern (Visitor Site A) and southeastern (Visitor Site B) coasts of Seabee Hook. The boundaries of the Visitor Site Guidelines areas in part share the boundary of ASPA No. 106, which are fixed and defined by coordinates and are demarcated on large-scale maps. The boundaries maintain a minimum distance of 5 m from the 2009 surveyed extent of the Adélie colony and extend to the coast of Seabee Hook. The sites were selected as the most suitable for continued visitor access on the grounds that:
    • The boundary revision ensures maximum protection to the values of ASPA No. 106, while accommodating some limited visitor access to previously impacted areas;
    • The Managed Zone presently contains a number of areas considered unsuitable for tourist visits. The proposed changes address this and also ensure the revised plan is consistent with policy adopted elsewhere in the Antarctic in relation to tourist entry into ASPAs;
    • The proposed more limited visitor site in the vicinity of the former station is previously impacted and any visitor access is therefore likely to contribute minimal additional disturbance;
    • The majority of former station areas remain within the ASPA, ensuring scientific values related to studies of colony recovery are protected;
    • The boundary is accurately surveyed and defined by coordinates, and therefore would be fixed while the ASPA No. 106 Management Plan is in force;
    • The visitor areas are readily identifiable by reference to the flat unoccupied areas against raised penguin nesting mounds and guano stains, which are the most prominent natural features on Seabee Hook;
    • The proposed visitor areas maintain a distance of >5 m from Adelie breeding subcolonies, and provide broad, flat viewing areas where visitors can move about easily without causing disturbance;
    • The emergency cache remains accessible to visitors in all circumstances;
    • The visitor areas allow for a spread of parties, which helps reduce any visual intrusion that may arise;
    • The visitor areas have good seaward access, which allows for some flexibility in landings and viewings depending on sea and ice conditions, and is therefore safer;
    • The preferred landing sites are those in Visitor Sites A & B. If conditions make these sites dangerous, for safety reasons an alternate landing site along the shoreline between these two sites may be used. Thus, when sea ice is absent or unsafe, small, closely guided groups may walk along the shoreline boundary of ASPA No. 106 between the two visitor sites. These walking groups must be strictly controlled and maintain a ratio of 1 guide to 10 passengers. 
The draft Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guide for Seabee Hook, Cape Hallett, attached to this Working Paper is consistent with the contents and format established in Resolution 2 (2006), with the objective of being consistent with existing guidelines or those that are in the process of being adopted.  
It is proposed that: 
    • the list of sites subject to Site Guidelines that have been adopted by the ATCM be extended to include Seabee Hook, Cape Hallett; 
    • the Secretariat publishes the Antarctic Treaty Visitor Site Guide for Seabee Hook, Cape Hallett, on its website and in hard copy.
