Report of the CEP Observer to the twenty-eighth meeting of the Scientific Committee to CCAMLR; 26 – 30 October 2009
Abstract
The Chair of the Committee for Environmental Protection, Dr Neil Gilbert (New Zealand), was the CEP Observer at the twenty-eighth meeting of CCAMLR’s Scientific Committee (SC-CAMLR), 26 to 30 October 2009.  
This report highlights the outcomes to SC-CAMLR XXVIII meeting that are of interest to the CEP, and in accordance with those issues agreed to be of common interest by the joint CEP / SC-CAMLR workshop (April 2009).  These include:
    • Climate change
    • Biodiversity and non-native species
    • Species requiring special protection
    • Marine spatial management and protection
    • Ecosystem and environmental monitoring

CEP Observer’s Report
The joint CEP / SC-CAMLR workshop1 had recommended that: 
“[the process of exchanging reports] be continued and focused primarily on the five issues of common interest addressed in this report (i.e. climate change, biodiversity and non-native species, species requiring special protection, marine spatial management and area protection, and ecosystem and environmental monitoring). It was suggested that the reports exchanged between CEP and SC-CAMLR have a common formatting so that readers can easily find information and recommendations of particular interest”.
This report follows that recommendation.
The full report of the Scientific Committee meeting will shortly be publicly available on the CCAMLR Secretariat website at www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/sr/drt.htm.

CEP / SC-CAMLR interaction
The Scientific Committee noted the positive relationship between SC-CAMLR and the CEP, as a result of the Joint Workshop in April 2009.  The Scientific Committee agreed that the workshop had established a joint understanding of how these two bodies might collaborate in the future.  
The Scientific Committee endorsed the recommendations contained in the Workshop report, and recommended that the Chairs of the respective Committees liaise in order to consider:
    • options for making progress on the various recommendations from the Joint Workshop;
    • options for further joint meetings and workshops, and possible timing of such meetings;
    • how to improve coordination on other intersessional meetings and workshops that may be of common interest; and
    • in doing so, take into account the recommendations from the CCAMLR Performance Review Panel on how to improve coordination with the Antarctic Treaty System.

Climate Change
The Scientific Committee agreed that climate change has the potential to induce rapid change within ecosystems which may affect how data collected through CCAMLR’s ecosystem monitoring programme (CEMP) might be used to detect fisheries impacts as well as for distinguishing fisheries impacts from climate impacts.
The Scientific Committee agreed that reviewing CEMP in an era of rapid climate change, is now a priority issue and tasked WG-EMM with undertaking the work.  The Scientific Committee noted that such a review was timely given forthcoming meetings such as the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Climate Change.

The Scientific Committee noted the challenges involved in establishing adequate monitoring measures at established CEMP sites and new sites, including for national programmes in allocating resources to support such monitoring.

The Scientific Committee also noted the report of a workshop on the Southern Ocean Sentinel Programme, facilitated by Australia (see http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=35088).  The workshop recognised that reference areas will be critical for monitoring changes in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and for attributing which of these changes are climate change impacts.

Biodiversity and Non-native Species
No discussions were held at SC-CAMLR XXVIII with regard to non-native species.  It is noted that the joint workshop recommended that CEP take the lead on this issue ensuring that SC-CAMLR is kept informed.

Species Requiring Special Protection
CCAMLR regularly reviews the status and trends of target species, by-catch species and key ecosystem “indicator” species.
SC-CAMLR XVIII reviewed the report of its Working Group on Incidental Mortality Associated with Fishing (WG-IMAF) and:
    • encouraged close collaboration between CCAMLR and ACAP and requested Members to submit data on incidental mortality of Convention Area birds that may occur in their fisheries outside of the Convention Area;
    • noted that WG-IMAF was unable to provide an estimate of seabird and marine mammal mortality as a result of IUU activity due to a lack of information on the potential rate of interactions with IUU gillnet fisheries;
    • reviewed France’s actions to reduce the impacts of the longline fishery on white-chinned and grey petrels in the Crozet archipelago, and noted France’s commitment to assess the population size in the area to further understand the status of these species; and
    • agreed that the relatively low levels of incidental mortality within most areas of the Convention Area meant that a biennial schedule for evaluating the levels of incidental mortality was now appropriate.

Marine Spatial Management and Protection
SC-CAMLR XXVIII considered a proposal to protect a marine area to the south of the South Orkney Islands, selected on the basis of a systematic conservation planning analysis, and incorporating an area of importance for winter penguin foraging and unique oceanographic frontal systems.
SC-CAMLR XXVIII:
    • recommended adoption of the area (subsequently endorsed by the Commission);
    • recommended further work in relation to the additional areas of conservation importance in the South Orkney Islands region; and
    • agreed that WG-EMM consider research plans that could be used to support a management plan for the area once developed.
The Scientific Committee noted that projects were underway on marine spatial protection in several of the 11 priority regions (Appendix 4 to the report of CEP XII refers), but that significant further work is required to progress the establishment of a network of MPAs by 2012.
The Scientific Committee agreed on a series of milestones to be achieved over the next two years:
    • by 2010, collate relevant data for as many of the 11 priority regions as possible, and characterise each region in terms of biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes, physical environmental features and human activities;
    • by early 2011, convene a workshop to review progress, share experience on different approaches to the selection of candidate sites for protection, and determine a work program for the identification of MPAs in as many of the priority regions as possible;
    • by 2011, identify candidate areas for protection in as many of the priority regions as possible, based on the collated data and regional characterisations, and using appropriate selection methods;
    • by 2011, submit proposals for areas for protection to the Scientific Committee; and
    • by 2012, submit proposals on a representative system of MPAs to the Commission.

The Scientific Committee further requested WG-EMM to consider the following topics:
    • provision of advice on the development of a representative system of MPAs within the Convention Area by 2012;
    • review of progress at each milestone towards the 2012 target, and coordination between regional projects;
    • coordination with the CEP, and with groups such as SCAR-MarBIN and CAML, to ensure utilisation of the best available scientific data; and
    • convene a workshop in 2011 to review progress, share experience on approaches to the selection of candidate sites for protection, and determine a work program for the identification of MPAs.

The Scientific Committee agreed that experts/observers from the CEP and SCAR should be invited to attend meetings of WG-EMM, and to participate in intersessional work on MPAs.

Bottom fishing activities and vulnerable marine ecosystems 
SC-CAMLR XXVIII evaluated work undertaken by WG-EMM and WG-FSA, as well as the outcomes from an experts workshop convened and hosted by the USA.
The Scientific Committee recommended to the Commission:
    • a number of changes that needed to be made to the relevant CCAMLR Conservation Measures pertaining to VMEs and to their implementation;
    • adoption by the Commission of a new CCAMLR VME Taxa Classification Guide; and
    • that 28 identified VMEs be added to CCAMLR’s VME register and that they be given protection by closing specified management areas in CCAMLR Subarea 48.2.

Ecosystem and Environmental Monitoring
CCAMLR’s ecosystem monitoring programme (CEMP) aims to:
(1) detect and record significant changes in critical components of the marine ecosystem within the Convention Area, and

(2) distinguish between changes due to harvesting of commercial species and changes due to physical and biological environmental variability.
With regard to CEMP, SC-CAMLR XXVIII:
    • noted the report of a strong ecosystem anomaly at South Georgia during 2009, manifested in the lowest krill density on record, very low land-based predator breeding performance, changes in the diet of icefish and anomalous values for sea-surface temperature.  SC-CAMLR noted the importance of ecosystem monitoring for early detection of such anomalies;
    • welcomed
        ◦ new initiatives for CEMP monitoring including at Petermann Island;
        ◦ new data collected in a manner consistent with CEMP standard methods, from penguin colonies used to monitor tourism impacts on Goudier Island.
    • noted the need for a broad monitoring network to provide the necessary information available to manage CCAMLR fisheries, particularly the krill fishery, in the face of climate change and that the joint SC-CAMLR / CEP workshop had also highlighted the importance of exploring new and innovative ways to augment existing resources dedicated to ecosystem monitoring;
    • encouraged further development of new photographic methodologies by Australia to provide penguin breeding population estimates, which may be incorporated into CEMP Standard Methods;
    • encouraged Members to investigate other innovative ways to augment monitoring approaches.


SC-CAMLR Chair
SC-CAMLR XXVIII elected Dr David Agnew (UK) as its new Chair.
Next meeting
The CEP is invited to nominate a representative to attend SC-CAMLR-XXIX in October 2010.
