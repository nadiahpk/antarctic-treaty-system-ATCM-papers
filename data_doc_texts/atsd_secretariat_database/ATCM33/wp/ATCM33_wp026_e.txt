Final Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on the revision of List A “Permanent Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations” appended to Resolution 5 (1995)
Presented by Argentina
Summary 
The present document contains the Final Report of the ATCM Intersessional Contact Group, convened by Argentina, tasked by ATCM XXXI (Kyv, 2008) to review Checklist A “Permanent Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations” contained in Resolution 5 (1995). The main objective of this revision was to contribute to make inspections more efficient and to help both inspectors and inspected staff, by providing clearer and more comprehensive questions and likely sources of information to obtain and/or check data collected at the station. 
Introduction
At ATCM XXXI (Kyiv, 2008) Argentina presented Working Paper 54 “Proposal to revise the inspection checklists contained in Resolution 5 (1995)”. In agreement with WP 54, ATCM XXXI (Kyiv, 2008) decided to establish an open-ended web-based ICG to review, with support from the Secretariat, Checklist A “Permanent Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations” contained in Resolution 5 (1995), as the first step towards reviewing all the checklists contained in this Resolution. The main objective of this revision was to contribute to make inspections more efficient and to help both inspectors and inspected staff, by providing clearer and more comprehensive questions and likely sources of information to obtain and/or check data collected at the station. 
The following terms of reference were agreed for this group: 
    • Identify which questions in Checklist A seek information that should already be provided by Parties to the Antarctic Treaty Information Exchange System; 
    • Consider the possible updating of the Checklist by rewording these questions and/or by adding new ones to enable the checklist to facilitate the inspection of permanent Antarctic stations and associated installations, and suggest which questions might more appropriately be answered by direct observation and which questions could be preliminarily answered by consulting the documents and information regarding the base in question. 
    • Submit a report with a draft revised checklist to the next ATCM, mindful that questions should not be deleted if the information sought is currently unavailable in other databases or information exchanges, and that the report should not preclude inspection teams from asking questions in addition to those contained in any checklist. 

Argentina agreed to be the convenor of the ICG and to report progress to ATCM XXXII (Baltimore, 2009). A progress report of this ICG was presented to ATCM XXXII as Working Paper 37 (Argentina). The Meeting agreed to allow this group to continue its work for another intersessional period (Final Report ATCM XXXII, para 236) to fulfil the mandate given by ATCM XXXI (Kyiv, 2008) and submit a report with a draft revised checklist to the ATCM XXXIII (Punta del Este, 2010). 
The following Parties and observers have actively contributed with comments to this ICG: Argentina, Australia, France, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States and COMNAP. 

Summary of Proposed Changes to the original Checklist “A”
Attached to this document as Appendix 1, is a draft revised Checklist “A”, as prepared after several rounds of discussion within the ICG since ATCM XXXI (Kyiv, 2008). 
The main changes introduced to the original Checklist “A” can be summarized as follows: 
a) Format 
The original list includes 21 sections, while some sections comprise one or two questions only.  A proposal to modify (and reduce to 12) the original sections of the checklist is presented in the attached document, in order to more adequately group the existing 116 questions and to put together related issues, as a contribution to a better understanding of the revised checklist.

b) References to the Antarctic Treaty Information Exchange System and other likely sources of “off-site” and “on-site” information
When applicable, references to sources where information can be collected prior, during and after an inspection takes place, were introduced. 
An “Off site Source” corresponds to a source of information which can be accessed both prior and after the inspection (although this should not prevent inspection teams to access other off site sources not listed), while an “On site source” corresponds to a source of information which can only be accessed while the inspection team is visiting the station (bearing in mind that other ways of obtaining/checking in situ information not listed here can exist). 

c) Editorial changes
Editorial changes on sixty-six (66) questions were introduced in order: 
    • to clarify the accurate meaning and/or the scope of the question 
    • to provide inspectors with more elements/examples to broaden the scope of the question. 
    • to reflect agreed provisions and recommendations stemmed from the Antarctic Treaty System 
    • to avoid misunderstandings when translated in different languages.
    • to make questions simpler to inspectors 
    • to keep consistency throughout the checklist 

d) New questions
A total of fourteen (14) new questions were added to the original checklist so as:
    • to cover all existing Antarctic Treaty System’s provisions up to date
    • to keep consistency with questions contained in related sections 
    • to incorporate relevant issues to certain sections

e) Deletion of questions
A total of eleven (11) questions were deleted based on some of the following facts: 
    • provisions contained in the question were no longer applicable.
    • overlapping occurred with existing and/or new questions
    • the staff of the station is not in the position to provide the information requested 


All questions were listed without any numbers, below each of the new proposed sections. A single asterisk (*) points out those questions with editorial changes, while a double one (**) indicates new questions. These asterisks will be removed once this revised checklist is agreed. 
Recommendation 
Argentina, on behalf of all participants of this ICG, recommends that the ATCM adopt, by means of a Resolution, the proposed draft revised document included in Appendix A, with a view to finalising the review of Checklist A “Permanent Antarctic Stations and Associated Installations” contained in Resolution 5 (1995).
