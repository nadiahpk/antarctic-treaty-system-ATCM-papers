Report from Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Implications of Climate Change for Antarctic Management and Governance
Co-chairs’ executive summary with advice for actions1
The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on impacts of climate change for management and governance of the Antarctic region (ATME) was attended by 36 representatives of 15 Antarctic Treaty Parties, 8 invited experts from 4 organisations and one representative from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat. The meeting took place in Svolvær, Norway on 7-9 April 2010. The ATME was convened in accordance with Decision 1 of ATCM XXXII which requested the meeting to examine the following topics relevant to the issue of climate change in Antarctica: 

    • key scientific aspects of climate change and consequences of such change to the Antarctic terrestrial and marine environment;
    • implications of climate change to management of Antarctic activities;
    • the need for monitoring, scenario planning and risk assessments;
    • outcomes of the Copenhagen negotiations relevant for the Antarctic; and
    • the need for further consideration of any of the above issues and manners in which this can be achieved.

Altogether 3 working papers and 13 information papers were submitted to the ATME and presented in plenary on the first day of the meeting. The wide-ranging contents of these papers were a major reason for the considerable progress that the ATME was able to make on the various issues. The work during the rest of the ATME was organised partly in working groups, partly in plenary. In the final plenary the Meeting reached agreement on all 30 recommendations in this report. 

The Meeting underscored the importance of the SCAR’s report on the Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment, the ACCE report, as a fundamental source of scientific information informing its deliberations, and the importance that the scientific knowledge presented in the report as well as its key findings should play in further consideration of topics related to climate change in the Antarctic.  

The recommendations from the Meeting are listed below as a summary of the advice for actions by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:  

Recommendation 1: The ATME recommends that the ATCM acknowledge and welcome the SCAR ACCE report as an important resource for its own deliberations and as an input to the wider global climate negotiations, e.g. the UNFCCC. 

Recommendation 2: The ATME recommends that the ATCM considers developing an Antarctic climate change communication plan to bring the findings of the ACCE report to the attention of other decision makers, the general public and the media. 

Recommendation 3: The ATME recommends that the ATCM consider how best to provide information about Antarctic climate change to fora discussing and negotiating global climate change.  

Recommendation 4: The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to:
    • acknowledge and encourage continuing efforts in developing and exchanging experience of energy efficiency and alternative energy practices so as to promote reduction of the carbon footprint of activities in Antarctica and cut fossil fuel use from stations, vessels, ground transportation and aircraft;
    • solicit from COMNAP a report on progress on the implementation of its Best Practice for Energy Management – Guidance and Recommendations (endorsed by CEP X in Delhi), and ask for an update including details of best practices on energy efficiency and alternative energy deployment; and 
    • welcome the efforts of IAATO in working towards developing best practice towards reducing the carbon footprint of its tour ships.

Recommendation 5: Recognizing the importance of emission cuts in Antarctica and their symbolic value in the global context, the ATME recommends that the ATCM encourage COMNAP to work with national programmes to use consistent methods to quantify and publish savings made by energy efficiencies, and which contribute to both (a) reducing carbon footprint, and (b) reducing fuel consumption and operating costs. 

Recommendation 6: The ATME recommend that Parties be advised to use atmospheric models to evaluate the wind regimes around their individual stations, to determine the potential for wind power as a means of cutting fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

Recommendation 7: Welcoming the risk assessment approach taken by Australia to identify potential climate change implications for current and future Antarctic infrastructure, logistics and environmental values, the ATME recommends that Parties be encouraged to undertake and report on appropriate risk assessment processes. 

Recommendation 8: In developing EIAs for new facilities, the ATME recommends that Parties be requested to take climate change considerations into account.

Recommendation 9: Noting that the WMO Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar Observations, Research and Services, promotes and coordinates relevant programs carried out in the polar regions, the ATME recommends that the Panel and others be urged to increase the refinement of Antarctic climate models, and the WMO be invited to provide regular reports to the ATCM to update Parties on progress with outcomes of the Committee’s activities.  

Recommendation 10: The ATME recommends that Parties be advised to expand research that will refine and enhance our ability to predict future climate change with increasing accuracy on various temporal and geographical scales; and to encourage steps to link scientific research efforts to the activities of operational agencies involved in providing climate services and other related activities.   

Recommendation 11: Given that the IPY has been very successful in significantly increasing the volume and interdisciplinary character of polar research, especially in relation to understanding climate change, the ATME recommends that national agencies be urged to maintain the momentum of that research as a key contribution to the IPY legacy.

Recommendation 12: The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage the collaboration required to develop comprehensive and advanced integrated Earth System models capable of producing outputs at decadal scales and regional scales that can be used to assess the likelihood, timing and amplitude of climate change.  

Recommendation 13: The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage the space agencies to continue coordinated observations of the Antarctic region from space, in the context of improving the operation of observing systems for climate change, and to attend a future ATCM to give a demonstration of the use of modern space-based technologies for observing the Antarctic region in the context of climate change.  

Recommendation 14: The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to continue to strongly encourage collaboration and development of sustained integrated observing systems using in situ, air and space-based techniques.

Recommendation 15: Recognizing that Parties are obliged under the Treaty to share scientific data and information, and that there is a great deal to be gained from working more closely together on the collection of observations of climate change and its effects, the ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage greater collaboration in such collections, and to support access to such data through the Antarctic Master Directory. 

Recommendation 16: The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage national operators and SCAR to seek close cooperation and synergies with existing climate observing and assessment initiatives such as the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the IPCC.

Recommendation 17: The ATME recommends that the ATCM encourages SCAR to incorporate identification of key regions, habitats and species at greatest risk from climate change effects into its research programmes.

Recommendation 18: The ATME recommends that ATCM and CEP give consideration to taking a more regional approach in the application of environmental management tools, in addition to the current continent-wide approach.

Recommendation 19: The ATME recommends that the CEP consider developing a climate change response work programme. Such a work programme should attempt to incorporate, inter alia:
    • The need to continue to afford a high priority to the management of non-native species;
    • A classification of existing protected areas according to climate change vulnerability;
    • The need for more sophisticated and coordinated ecosystem monitoring, including the need for increased collaboration between CEP and SC-CAMLR;
    • A review of existing management tools to assess their continuing suitability in a climate change context (e.g. EIA guidelines (particularly with regard to planned long-term activities), Specially Protected Species guidelines, the guide to the preparation of management plans).

Recommendation 20: The ATME recommends that the ATCM and CEP encourage national Antarctic programmes to undertake marine and terrestrial biodiversity surveys and to submit, as a matter of urgency, all relevant biodiversity data to appropriate databases (e.g. the Biodiversity Database).  In conducting such surveys, priority attention should be paid to regions considered to be at high risk of climate change impacts as well as to existing protected areas established to protect biological values.

Recommendation 21: The ATME recommends that the CEP give consideration as to means for improving climate change related data and information management to support its environmental management responsibilities.  

Recommendation 22: The ATME recommends that the CEP consider:
    •  using established methods of identifying a) Antarctic environments at high risk from establishment by non-natives and b) non-native species that present a high risk of establishment in Antarctica;
    • implementing non-native species monitoring protocols at areas of high risk, as well as at protected areas;
    • developing decision making tools to aid responses to identified establishments of non-native species.

Recommendation 23: The ATME recommends that Parties be encouraged to comprehensively and consistently implement management measures to respond to the environmental implications of climate change, particularly measures to avoid introduction and translocation of non-native species, and to report on their effectiveness.

Recommendation 24: The ATME recommends that CEP review the means of applying protected and managed area management tools to ensure sufficient flexibility to account for climate change effects. Such a review should consider: 
    • the need to ensure that climate change effects are assessed during each five-yearly review of management plans, including for example, the need to establish protected and managed area boundaries that are climate change resilient; and
    • the potential to delist sites at which the original values to be protected have been lost or degraded.

Recommendation 25: The ATME recommends that the CEP consider a systematic approach to protected or managed areas to:
    • protect species, or habitats identified to be of particular risk to climate change consequences (cf. Recommendation 18);
    • accommodate areas that have potential to be environmental or climate refuges;
    • set aside areas for future climate change related research, including reference areas.

Recommendation 26: The ATME recommends, recognising the responsibilities of and need to coordinate with CCAMLR, that the CEP consider, and advise the ATCM accordingly, as to means by which automatic interim protection might be afforded to newly exposed areas, such as marine areas exposed through ice-shelf collapse.

Recommendation 27: The ATME recommends that the CEP and SC-CAMLR be encouraged to ensure that sufficiently frequent biodiversity surveys and adequate monitoring programmes are established to provide an understanding of climate change induced responses in species distribution and abundance.

Recommendation 28: The ATME recommends that CEP and SC-CAMLR continue to develop means for collecting and sharing data and information on the status and trends of species of interest to both bodies (seals, penguins and seabirds), including the need to cooperate with other experts bodies such as SCAR and ACAP.

Recommendation 29: The ATME recommends that the CEP remain alert to the development of climate change related conservation tools elsewhere in the world that may also have application in an Antarctic context (e.g. climate change adaptation plans, risk assessment tools and mechanisms for assisted translocation of endangered species).

Recommendation 30: The ATME recommends that Parties consider making climate change a separate agenda item on the ATCM and CEP agendas. 
Concluding remarks
The Meeting agreed that climate change and the implications for governance and management in Antarctica is both a relevant and important topic to discuss under the Antarctic Treaty system. It was also noted that this is an extremely broad topic, and that this ATME has, despite its 30 recommendations, only skimmed the surface and has been able to visit only a few selected topics in depth. 

The Meeting furthermore underscored the fact that the extensive and well-established cooperation in Antarctica will be a good foundation for achieving concrete results through concerted action (e.g. best practices, exchange of experiences and information with regard to logistics/infrastructure, environmental management, etc.). The Meeting noted the potential symbolic value of any actions taken in Antarctica, and the potential transferability of such actions to other regions of the world.  

The Meeting emphasized that the Antarctic offers a unique environment for the study of climate change and the recommendations and scientific findings should be used to inform other bodies such as IPCC and UNFCCC.

The Meeting underlined that the importance of the topic of climate change justifies a separate item for the agendas of the CEP and ATCM. 

Finally, the Meeting emphasized the importance of continuing the discussions on climate change issues in Antarctica. The Meeting encourages the ATCM to discuss/consider which of the recommendations of this meeting should be brought forward in further discussions in the first instance.
