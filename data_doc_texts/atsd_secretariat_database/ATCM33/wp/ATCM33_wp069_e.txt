Recommendations for reducing risks that affects the safety of human life, considering the increase in tourism in Antarctica during the last decade


INTRODUCTION

This document was presented by the Chilean delegation during the Meeting of experts on the management of ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic Treaty Area, Wellington, New Zealand, 9 to 11 Dec 2009. Considering the relevance of the topics covered and in addition to increase of passenger vessels performing touristic visits to the Antarctic we consider it necessary to present it again within the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting so that participating member acknowledge its recommendations, which should be applicable to all vessels visiting the Antarctic or those having the intention to navigate in those waters. Particular emphasis has been made to encourage the reporting of position of vessels, auxiliary means to offer in emergencies to other vessels and the need that officers on duty on bridge are properly trained in operations and navigation in Antarctic waters.

a)  Legal framework for the SAR scope

The State of Chile is part of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974 and of the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), 1979.

For all purposes, the Chilean Navy, as a sign of the State at sea, carries out the maintenance and operation of the Maritime Search and Rescue Service throughout the year. The purpose of this service is to rescue crew and passengers in distress as a result of an accident at sea within the Area of Responsibility of the National Search and Rescue Area (SAR Area). This purpose is accomplished by coordinating the use of institutional resources and those related to the Merchant Marine, to fishing or sport areas, which are ready to offer assistance.

b)  Maritime national area of Responsibility in the Antarctic Territory 

Maritime Search and Rescue Fifth District  (MRCC Punta Arenas).

From latitude 48° 49' 00" S to the South Pole, and up to longitude 131° W, including all waters west of the line binding A, B, C, D, E and F points of Chart No. 1 of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Argentina. Waters that being located in the South of parallel 58° 21',1 S are W of the meridian 53° 00' 00" W and up to the Antarctic Territory.

The Maritime Search and Rescue Centre – MRCC – is located in the Office of the Maritime Governor of Punta Arenas.

c)   Information on tourism voyages to the Antarctic

During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest to visit Antarctica. Therefore shipping companies have implemented tourist routes towards this continent using major passenger ships.

High season for Ship-Borne tourism is between November and April each year, when meteorological conditions are far more appropriate to visit this continent.

In the last decade, there were several incidents of passenger ships, which have jeopardized crew and passengers. These situations have occurred in SAR areas belonging to Chile and Argentina. Both countries have offered their assistance in such incidents and have coordinated and performed actions using their own resources and ships under different flags operating in the mentioned area.

The increase in the number of vessels has had such an effect that all countries that are bound by the Antarctic Treaty have their concerns, and therefore they have implemented different measures to reduce risks of accidents as well as of potential environmental damage.

To date, two workshops have been conducted: the first one in Chile and the second one in Argentina. They have been sponsored by the mentioned countries and leaded by the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP), with a massive participation of other countries adhering to the Antarctic Treaty and the presence of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO).

The main topic of these workshops was to recommend measures so as to all vessels implement them and thus reduce risks to passengers and crews.

One of the main problems for the countries bearing SAR responsibility in the Antarctic area is the little information on the position of vessels navigating in the area. To date this problem has been partly solved through the support given by the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) and the IAATO, notwithstanding the aforesaid, it is still necessary that vessels that do not belong to such entities send also their daily report.

It is also important to mention that, based on a reciprocal cooperation agreement between Chile and Argentina, and for ten years already, a Combined Naval Antarctic Patrol vessel has been operating from November to April. The purpose is to maintain in the area naval resources capable of performing rescue operations.  

As from 5 September 1991, the State of Chile has the Antarctic Navigation Academy “Piloto Luis Pardo Villalón”, where the course “Operations in Antarctic Waters” is offered to international students with classroom training and lectures in Spanish and simultaneous interpretation into English. Additional information about this course is available for ATCM XXXIII delegates as Information Paper, IP 111. 

It is worth mentioning that Chile requires that all masters and crew navigating towards the Antarctic in national vessels must pass the “Operations in Antarctic Waters” course.

d)     Statistical Analysis

As follows statistics on tourism and scientific vessels that have navigated towards Antarctica and through Chilean SAR area between 1998 and 2008, including both years. Information on their accidents is also included.

It is possible to see that the likelihood of accidents is greater when there is a higher quantity of vessels navigating, which can be expected. According to the research results, it has been inferred that these accidents are due to groundings in superficial waters and collisions against adrift ice, which would indicate the lack of knowledge of the bridge personnel regarding the navigation area. On the other hand, there is also a lack of understanding of the meteorological data, some reckless actions carried out by masters when approaching with their vessels.

Regardless recent efforts made by the countries adhering to the Antarctic Treaty as well as entities such as COMNAP and IAATO, it is deemed necessary to insist on the fact that ship-owners should implement measures tending to reduce risks to navigation.

e)     Summary

Bearing in mind the increase of touristic cruises voyages and of passengers to Antarctica in the last decade, the accidents and future impact, Chile proposes to adopt additional safety measures in order to minimize risks to navigation in Antarctic National SAR area, and remarks upon the need of submitting compulsory reports in the SAR Antarctic area under national responsibility.

f)     Recommendations

1.	To request those Flag States, which vessels undertake touristic voyages in Antarctica, to train their bridge crew in navigation in antarctic water. The subjects must be controlled before granting authorization to depart towards the Antarctic area.

2.	To request vessels undertaking touristic voyages to Antarctica and that do not belong to COMNAP or IAATO to report daily to MRCCs responsible of the SAR Antarctic areas. This request shall be done through the corresponding Flag States.







3.	To request all touristic and scientific vessels that along with the submission of their first report when entering Antarctic waters, they shall indicate their rescue and medical assistance capacities as well as the support they could offer. This information should be sent via e-mail to the Chilean and Argentinean MRCCs.

4.	To encourage member countries of the Antarctic Treaty to comply with the Resolution 3 (2004) “Tourism and non-governmental activities: more cooperation among Parties”, approved during the XXVII ATCM in Cape Town, South Africa.
