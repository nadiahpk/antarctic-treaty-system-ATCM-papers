Site Guidelines for Danco Island, Errera Channel, 
Antarctic Peninsula

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and United States (in conjunction with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators – IAATO)



Summary

1. Danco Island is a one mile long island in the southern part of the Errera Channel. Its north shore is characterised by a wide flat cobbled beach with a long snow free slope behind which rises up to the islands ice covered summit. Permanent ice dominates the top and south side of the island.  The concrete foundations of a former British hut (Base “O”) are located on the point. The site is frequently visited by tour operators, private yachts and occasionally national Antarctic programmes. 

2.  Following the adoption of Site Guidelines by Resolution 5(2005), the UK and US, in conjunction with IAATO, have prepared Site Guidelines for Danco Island, and recommend that the CEP submit these for adoption by the ATCM.
