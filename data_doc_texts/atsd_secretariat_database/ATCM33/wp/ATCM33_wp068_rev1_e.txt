Recommendations for controlling yachts under a third flag navigating
 in the Antarctic Chilean SAR area



A. 	SAR SCOPE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SPORT YACHTS:

    1. The State of Chile is part of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974 and of the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), 1979. 

    2. For all purposes, the Chilean Navy, as a sign of the State at sea, maintains and operates the Maritime Search and Rescue Service year-round. The purpose of this service is to rescue crew and passengers in distress as a result of an accident at sea within the Area of Responsibility of the National Search and Rescue Area (SAR Area). 

    3. The National Maritime Authority, under the Chilean Navy, works with the assistance of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS System) to protect human life at sea. It also incorporates satellite communication systems such as INMARSAT, COSPAS/SARSAT and the digital selective calling system. The main objective of this system is to alert on-shore search and rescue authorities and ships navigating in the nearby areas of the ship in distress regarding the danger situation so as they could participate in the coordinated SAR operation without any delay.

    4. On the other hand, under the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued detailed international instructions for the implementation of rescue operations of crew and passengers, setting out terminology and acronyms recognized and commonly used in the international maritime community.

    5. Chile, as a party to UNCLOS, recognizes the existence in Antarctica of all marine spaces recognized by international law, but the implementation of the SAR convention in Antarctic waters requires that each country, as Flag State, be responsible for its ships navigating in such waters and demand that they comply with essential safety measures regarding the safeguarding of human life at sea.
B.	MARITIME AREA OF NATIONAL SAR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ANTARCTIC TERRITORY:

Fifth District of Maritime Search and Rescue  (MRCC PUNTA ARENAS)

As from Latitude 48° 49' 00" S to the South Pole corresponding up to Longitude 131° W, all waters located West of the line connecting points A, B, C, D, E and F of Letter No 1 of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Argentina, and waters that, located South of parallel 58° 21',1 S are West of the meridian 53° 00' 00" and up to the Antarctic Territory.

The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) is located in the Maritime Governorship of Punta Arenas.

In the Antarctic Territory there are three maritime stations, under the Chilean Navy, that constantly maintain the state of alert in order to respond to any distress situation affecting not only human life at sea but also the marine environment. They act as the first alert and coordination instance for immediate mitigation actions.


C.	DATA RELATED TO STATISTICS ON YACHTS NAVIGATING IN THE ANTARCTIC DUE TO SPORTS ANDTOURISTIC PURPOSES:

In recent years, there has been a substantial increasing interest in visiting the Antarctic due to sport and tourism activities, using as mean of transportation sport yachts of different types and sizes.

According to statistics controlled by the MRCC CHILE, there was a total of 20 yachts visiting the Antarctic during the 2009/2010 season. This is shown in the following chart:



With the aim of explaining the list of yachts showing departure from the Antarctic, we can say that it is unknown the country from which they departed. This demonstrates the lack of information about their navigational route. Besides the aforesaid, there is also no information on the demands that the Flag State imposes to its own sport crafts navigating overseas.

Likewise, it is also noticeable that there is a variety of Flag States, which yachts sail towards Antarctic waters. This is shown in the following graphic:




STATISTICS ON YACHTS BY FLAG STATE 



In the last season there were three yacht incidents. There was little information about the yachts, as they had not departed from a Chilean port and one of the emergencies was known only due to information provided by one of the yachts. In all other cases, information was obtained from a Chilean maritime station in the Antarctic.

During the reception process of yachts in the Antarctic, personnel of the maritime stations detected that the majority of them were only carrying short range communication equipment (VHF), which with no doubt represents a risk in case they need to report an emergency. It is also unknown if they carried EPIRB or other means to report any emergency. 

Yachts navigating in Antarctic waters belong to different Flag States and normally there is no information about their last port of call. In most of the cases, they do not have appropriate communication equipment to report an emergency.

Although few accidents have been reported, there is a potential risk due to the inherent difficulties that Antarctic waters present to navigation.

According to the agreement of the countries of the Antarctic Treaty, it is recommended that port of departure countries shall make equipment demands to crafts navigating in Antarctic waters.

Generally, countries with SAR responsibility in Antarctic waters, have no information about yachts navigating in such area. Also, yachts do not report on their positions unless they are in distress.



D.  RECOMMENDATIONS:

    1. To request Flag States, which yachts navigate in Antarctic Waters, to improve communication equipment and to carry on board at least VHF, HF and EPIRB equipment as well as a life raft that can save the crew in an emergency.

    2. To request, through the Flag State of those yachts conducting sport and touristic visits to the Antarctic, to report daily to the MRCCs responsible of the Antarctic SAR areas.

    3. To suggest the States of the last port of departure of yachts navigating to Antarctic waters to inform about their navigational routes to MRCCs of the States responsible of the Antarctic SAR areas. They should also inspect the yacht on the required equipment for such navigation, according to provisions made by their own Flag State.

    4. To encourage member countries of the Antarctic Treaty to comply with the Resolution 3 (2004)  “Tourism and non-governmental activities: more cooperation among Parties”. This resolution was approved during the XXVII ATCM in Cape Town, South Africa.

    5. Based on the spirit of cooperation among the Parties to the Treaty, to encourage the information exchange on yachts, which while navigating consider making arrivals in the Antarctic Region and that have previously complied with the regulations of the Antarctic Protocol on Environmental Impact Assessment
