Review of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 101, 102, 103 and 164
Working Paper submitted by Australia 
Abstract
Australia has conducted a five-yearly review of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 101, 102, 103, and 164, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. Australia recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plans for each of these ASPAs. 
Introduction
In accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia has conducted a five-yearly review of the Management Plans for:
    • ASPA 101 Taylor Rookery, Mac.Robertson Land;
    • ASPA 102 Rookery Islands, Holme Bay, Mac.Robertson Land;
    • ASPA 103 Ardery Island and Odbert Island, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land; and
    • ASPA 164 Scullin and Murray Monoliths, Mac. Robertson Land
The reviews were conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (1998). The following sections briefly introduce each Area, and describe the proposed amendments arising from the review of each Management Plan.
ASPA 101 Taylor Rookery, Mac. Robertson Land
ASPA 101 Taylor Rookery, is located on the eastern side of Taylor Glacier, Mac.Robertson Land (67°27'S; 60°53'E). The site was originally designated as Specially Protected Area No. 1, through Recommendation IV-I (1966), after a proposal by Australia.  In accordance with Resolution XX-5 (1996) the site was redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 101.  A management plan for the Area was adopted under Recommendation XVII-2 (1992) and revised under Measure 2 (2005). The Area is primarily designated to protect the largest known colony (approximately 3000 adults) of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) located entirely on land. A revised management plan for ASPA 101 is provided at Attachment A.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 101
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A statement of the primary reason for designation is included in Section 1.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • The conditions in Section 7(ii) for accessing the Area have been updated to address the use of fixed wing aircraft.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 8 is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans.
ASPA 102 Rookery Islands, Holme Bay, Mac. Robertson Land
The Rookery Islands are a group of small islands and rocks in the western part of Holme Bay, lying to the north of the Masson and David Ranges in Mac.Robertson Land, East Antarctica (67°36'36.7" S, 62°32'06.7" E). The Rookery Islands were originally designated as Specially Protected Area No. 2 through Recommendation IV-II (1966), after a proposal by Australia. In accordance with Resolution XX-5 (1996), the site was redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 102.  A management plan for the Area was adopted under Recommendation XVII-2 (1992) and revised under Measure 2 (2005). The Area is primarily designated to protect breeding colonies of all six bird species resident in the region, including the southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) and the Cape petrel (Daption capensis) which are not known to occur elsewhere in the region. The Area is one of only four known breeding colonies of southern giant petrel on continental Antarctica. A revised management plan for ASPA 102 is provided at Attachment B.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 102
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A statement of the primary reason for designation is included in Section 1.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • Southern giant petrel and other seabird population figures have been updated in Section 1 and Section 6(i) to reflect the most recent censuses.
    • The provisions in Section 3 and Section 7(i) relating to access to the Giganteus Island Restricted Zone are slightly modified. Where previously the management plan allowed access to Giganteus Island during the breeding period only once every five years for the purpose of conducting a southern giant petrel census, the plan now encourages the conduct of a census at least once every five years. Providing the opportunity for more frequent censuses, undertaken in an appropriate manner, improves the chances of developing a more detailed understanding of population status and trends, and is consistent with Resolution 5 (2009) on Protection of the Southern Giant Petrel.
    • The conditions in Section 7(ii) for accessing the Area have been updated to address the use of fixed wing aircraft.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 8 is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans.
ASPA 103 Ardery Island and Odbert Island, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
Ardery Island and Odbert Island are among the southernmost of the Windmill Islands in the south of Vincennes Bay, off the Budd Coast of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (66°22'S; 110°28'E). The islands were originally designated as Specially Protected Area No. 3 through Recommendation IV-III (1966), after a proposal by Australia.  In accordance with Resolution XX-5 (1996), the site was redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 103. A management plan for the Area was adopted under Recommendation XVII-2 (1992) and revised under Measure 2 (2005). The Area is primarily designated to protect the unusual assemblage of several breeding species of petrel found on the islands, and an example of their habitat. The Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) and the southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) are of particular scientific interest. A revised management plan for ASPA 101 is provided at Attachment C.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 103:
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A statement of the primary reason for designation is included in Section 1.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • The conditions in Section 7(ii) for accessing the Area have been updated to address the use of fixed wing aircraft.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 8 is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans.
ASPA 164 Scullin and Murray Monoliths, Mac.Robertson Land
Scullin Monolith (67° 47'S, 66° 42'E) and Murray Monolith (67° 47'S, 66° 53'E) are situated on the coast of Mac.Robertson Land some 160 km east of Australia’s Mawson station. The monoliths were designated as ASPA 164 under Measure 2 (2005), following a proposal by Australia.  The Area contains the greatest concentration of breeding colonies of seabirds in East Antarctica. Seven species occupy territories in the Area: five species of petrel (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, Cape petrels Daption capense, southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides, snow petrels Pagodroma nivea, Wilson’s storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus), one penguin (Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae) and one larid (south polar skua Catharacta maccormicki). A revised management plan for ASPA 101 is provided at Attachment D.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 164:
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A statement of the primary reason for designation is included in Section 1.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • The conditions in Section 7(ii) for accessing the Area have been updated to address the use of fixed wing aircraft.
    • A requirement that visitors take precautions against the introduction of alien organisms to the Area, and guidance on appropriate precautions, has been added to Section 7(x).
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 8 is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans.
