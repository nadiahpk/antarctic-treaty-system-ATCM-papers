XXXI SCAR Meeting – XXXIII COMNAP Meeting 
Buenos Aires – 2010
(Argentine invitation for participants)

Argentina hereby extends a warm invitation for participants to attend the XXXI Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and its Open Scientific Conference (OSC) as well as the XXXIII meeting of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) to take place in Buenos Aires between July 30 and August 12 of 2010.

The SCAR Meeting includes the following events:

1)	SCAR Business meetings (July 30-August 2)
2)	SCAR Open Science Conference (August 3-6)
3)	SCAR Delegates Meeting (August 9-11). 

The COMNAP Meetings will take place between August 9 – 12 of 2010.

Participation at the scientific group meetings (SCAR Business meetings) and at OSC meetings is open. Whilst the former meetings are also free of charge the latter ones imply an attendance fee. Argentina has, nonetheless, made significant efforts to allow for the OSC registration fees to be as low as possible and has also offered several grants to cover such costs for students and young investigators who wish to take part in the event.            

Under the title “Antarctica –Witness to the Past and Guide to the Future,” this is SCAR´s first scientific meeting after the finalization of the field and observation activities undertaken as part of the International Polar Year (IPY), thus it is an excellent opportunity for the initial results obtained to be presented. 

The topics of the OSC scientific sessions as established by an ad-hoc international scientific committee will be as follows:
