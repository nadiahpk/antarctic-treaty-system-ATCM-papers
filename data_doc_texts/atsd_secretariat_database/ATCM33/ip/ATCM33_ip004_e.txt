Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the Thirty-Third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
Executive Summary

Introduction 
    1. The Twenty-Eighth Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)1 was held in Hobart from 26 October to 6 November 2009. Emphasis in this report is given to items that are particularly relevant to the ATCM XXXIII agenda. Paragraph references for relevant discussions and decisions from CCAMLR XXVIII are provided in Appendix I.
CCAMLR Fisheries in 2008/09
Catches in 2009/098 
    2. The catches of the three main target species over the last three seasons are shown in Table 1

Table1. Catches of toothfish (Dissostichus spp.), icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and krill (Euphausia superba) reported from the CAMLR Convention Area during the seasons 2006/07 to 2008/09.


    3. It is estimated that, in addition to these reported catches, some 938 tonnes of Toothfish. were taken as a result of IUU fishing in the Convention Area in 2008/09, compared with 1168 tonnes in 2007/08. The catch of krill in 2008/09 was taken from the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney regions with <1t taken from South Georgia. 

Development of the krill fishery

    4. In response to evidence of market-led changes in the krill fishery CCAMLR this year agreed to: 
    • spatially sub-divide the existing catch trigger level among subareas in Area 48.
    • increase the reporting frequency of krill catches 
    • implement a process to obtain systematic observer coverage from all krill vessels.

Conservation Measures 
  
    5. CCAMLR introduced  a requirement (CM 23-07)  for daily catch and effort reporting from exploratory fisheries (with the exception of krill) to allow more accurate forecasting of the closure of fisheries, especially those with low catch limits.   

    6. Three new CCAMLR Resolutions were introduced at CCAMLR XXVIII:

    • Resolution 29/XXVIII Ratification of the Salvage Convention by Members of CCAMLR 
    • Resolution 30/XXVIII Climate Change 
    • Resolution 31/XXVIII Best Available Science 
    7. All measures and resolutions are published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2008/09 available from the CCAMLR Secretariat or http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cm/09-10/toc.htm. 
Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Fishing 
    8. IUU fishing for Dissostichus spp. in the Convention Area has been a major issue for the Commission since 1997. CCAMLR affords high priority to eliminating such fishing and implements an integrated suite of administrative, political and enforcement-related measures to address the problem consistent with international best practice.
Ecosystem Monitoring and Management
    9. The CCAMLR scientific community is continuing to develop procedures to allow data on the ecosystem, including those collected through CEMP, to be formally incorporated into precautionary management decisions. In this respect, the Commission has afforded high priority to:
    • Ecosystem Effects of Fishing for krill, 
    • Spatial Management to Facilitate the Conservation of Marine Biodiversity including Marine Protected Areas and  avoiding significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems 
    • Ecosystem models
    • Climate change in relation to conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.

Deep-sea bottom fishing and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs)
    10. CCAMLR  received 30 VME indicator notifications of which seven consisted of at least 10 VME indicator units and resulted in seven Risk Areas being declared, and closed to fishing, in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2.

    11. The Secretariat has also received a total of 30 notifications of encounters with VMEs made during the course of research surveys, following the procedure outlines in Conservation Measure 22-06, and  these VMEs be recorded in the Secretariat’s VME Register.  CCAMLR agreed that the VMEs reported in Subarea 48.2 should be given protection in the experimental harvest regime for crabs in that subarea by closing experimental blocks A, C and E.


 
Incidental mortality in CCAMLR  Fisheries
    12. Compliance with seabird mitigation measures in  CCAMLR managed fisheries has resulted in low or near zero  incidental mortality.  However, the levels of incidental mortality i of seabird species breeding in the Convention Area n adjacent fisheries  remains a cause for concern. 
Marine Protected Areas (MPAS)
    13. CCAMLR and the CEP have concluded that a system of marine areas for biodiversity conservation in the Southern Ocean should be addressed as a matter of priority (CCAMLR XXIII, paragraph 4.13; CEP-IX, paragraph 94 to 101). 
    14. In 2009 CCAMLR endorsed the Scientific Committee recommendations on a proposal for a marine protected area in the South Orkney Islands  and adopted Conservation Measure 91-03 (2009) ‘Protection of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf’. This 94000km2 MPA (Figure 1) was selected on the basis of a systematic conservation planning analysis and includes representative examples of two pelagic bioregions, incorporates an area of key importance for winter penguin foraging and unique oceanographic frontal systems.

  CCAMLR Performance Review
    15. CCAMLR recognises the need to develop the capacity to ensure the long-term  provision of high-quality scientific advice.  Following the generous offer by Norway to provide A$100 000 CCAMLR established a ‘General Science Capacity Special Fund’ to facilitate the provision of the best scientific information available to the Commission by :
        i) securing wider participation, not least from young scientists, in the work of the Scientific Committee, 
        ii) promoting burden sharing and build capacity within the Scientific Committee, through assistance with the collection, study and exchange of information. 
        iii) encouraging and promoting  the conduct of cooperative and collaborative research in order to extend knowledge of the marine living resources of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.
    2. In response to the recommendations of the CCAMLR Performance Review to highlight  obligations arising from connections between the CAMLR Convention and the Antarctic Treaty the CCAMLR Secretariat prepared an information pack (CCAMLR-XXVIII/BG/16) with a covering note prepared by Australia (as Depositary) (CCAMLR-XXVIII/BG/38).  These documents outlined the nature of those  connections, along with other information, to be provided to States wishing to accede to the Convention, as well as to Acceding States wishing to become Members of CCAMLR.  
Co-operation with international organizations, particularly the ATCM.
ATCM 
    3. CCAMLR  noted the importance of ATCM XXXII as it marked the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Antarctic Treaty. CCAMLR also recognised the importance of Ministerial Declarations on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty and the International Polar Year and Polar Science.  These declarations included an affirmation of the principles of the Antarctic Treaty System that are at the core of CCAMLR and the promotion of the science that underpins all of the Commission’s work.  In recognition of their importance, CCAMLR agreed to append the text of these Declarations to its report (CCAMLR XXVIII  Annex 7). 
    4. CCAMLR  endorsed the recommendations of the Joint SC-CAMLR–CEP Workshop report and agreed that this had been a very productive and timely meeting. 

Non-Contracting Parties
    5. As part of this policy CCAMLR approved expenditure to support a capacity building training event in Africa in order to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing in the Convention Area which is undertaken by vessels flagged to NCPs in Africa and / or supported by activities and services found in the ports of NCPs in Africa.

Co-Operation with Other International Organizations
    6. CCAMLR continues to urge its Members to accept and ratify a number of relevant international agreements, such as the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). In order to facilitate these interactions  CCAMLR works closely with the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels and in April 2010 agreed an MOU with ACAP to formalise data sharing and other arrangements between the two bodies.


Appointment of the Executive Secretary
    7. The Heads of Delegations of CCAMLR Members appointed Mr Andrew (Drew) Wright (Australia) to take over from the present Executive Secretary. Mr Wright is currently Executive Secretary of the WCPFC and will take up this appointment at CCAMLR in April 2010.  
    8. The Commission agreed that the outgoing Executive Secretary Dr Denzil Miller was the embodiment of CCAMLR and an asset to the Antarctic Treaty System and would be missed very much.
