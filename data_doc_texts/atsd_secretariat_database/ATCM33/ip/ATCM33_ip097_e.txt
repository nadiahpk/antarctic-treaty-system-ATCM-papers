Title: The Structure and dynamics of polar ecosystems: Interhemispheric comparisons of micro, macroflora and biogeochemical processes in relation to climate change
 
Abstract: INTER-HEMISPHERE is a new activity developed within PolarCLIMATE Theme 3, a bipolar project, aiming to generate local/zonal and inter-hemispheric comparative studies and models to relate JRP results to the polar climate system based on the geographic variation in climate and disturbance regimes. INTER-HEMISPHERE involves a broad international cooperation-13 partners in 12 countries in Europe, Asia and Australia between specialists in various fields to understand the structure and dynamics of polar ecosystems by correlating JRP data and research on micro, macroflora and biogeochemical processes in various polar areas with the climate change, based on a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach. Field work will be performed in Arctica (Spitsbergen, Greenland, Lapland, Arctic Russia) and East&West Antarctica. INTER-HEMISPHERE focuses on climate change consequences bio/ecosystems in both polar area to ascertain the rates/magnitude of impact and the system adaptation/modification, by generating knowledge on polar microclimate, pedobiology, limnology and adaptation mechanisms in extreme environments. Analysis of ecosystem structure/responses to climate changes will be performed to preserve the genetic and ecosystem structure information and reveal the modification trends. INTER-HEMISPHERE scientific objectives reflect its IPs&APs objectives: Polar microbiology/microbial ecology (8 partners: Australia, Bulgaria, Denmark,  India, Italy, Romania, Russia, Spain, Ukraine); Permafrost and polar pedobiology (2: Estonia, Romania); Polar vegetation (3: Czech Republic, Poland, Russia) and Polar ecology (6: Czech Republic, Estonia, India, Spain, Romania, Ukraine). To this aim in view, the WorkPlan includes the work packages; WP3-Environment characterization (Arctic and Antarctic): ascertaining of terrestrial/aquatic environment conditions, climate included; WP4-Biodiversity assessment; WP5-Ascertaining of climate change impacts on ecosystems and model elaboration. JRP purpose is to accomplish this complex research in the field and laboratories by establishing the adequate scientific, logistic and cooperation frameworks to enable the integration of  partner research, benefiting from the state-of-the-art approach, equipment, methodologies and access to more polar research areas and facilities. INTER-HEMISPHERE (2010-2012) along with partner IPY projects will generate a legacy a joint database for future research.
