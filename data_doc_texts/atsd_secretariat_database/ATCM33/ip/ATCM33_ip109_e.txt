Argentina has announced it will be hosting the Open Science Conference (OSC) which takes place as part of the biennial SCAR meetings which is scheduled for August 3-6 2010 in Buenos Aires.

The organizational costs of international scientific events where a large number of experts is expected (i.e. Oslo IPY Conference) is usually very high which has lead to registration fees also being considerable. In addition, increased travel and lodging expenses, as well as the per diems which scientists need to face in order to present their works in these fora is resulting in inconvenient limited participation. Therefore there is the risk that these types of scientific meetings become exclusive to those with a more flexible financial situation, thus jeopardizing participation of students and younger investigators who, at such an early stage in their careers, lack the necessary means for funding their participation at these conferences. 

Argentina has noted this situation with concern, an has so expressed its point of view through its delegates at different fora (like SCAR) and therefore, upon taking up the organization of the OSC 2010 has made the commitment to make a large investment so as to allow for registration fees to be as low as possible (even lower than the previous meeting).

At the same time we have offered 250 grants for students and young investigators under 40 years of age, of any nationality, who wish to attend the event and present at least one scientific work. They cover the OSC registration fee either totally or partially. Further detailed information may be consulted at the sites official website http://www.dna.gov.ar/scar2010/  under the “travel grants” section. 

Argentina is fully aware that this view is also shared by other members of the Antarctic Treaty who have also offered assistance to facilitate attendance to this event.
