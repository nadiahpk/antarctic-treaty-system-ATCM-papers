Spatial Patterns of Tour Ship Traffic in the 
Antarctic Peninsula Region

Introduction
As quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of tour ship traffic may aid efforts to monitor and manage Antarctic ship-borne tourism, the United States and IAATO felt that the attached paper would be of interest to ATCM XXXIII and CEP XI. This paper by Oceanites, Inc. and the Antarctic Site Inventory (ASI), the University of Maryland and the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), published in Antarctic Science in November 2009, reviews the pattern of tour ship traffic along the Antarctic Peninsula using 19 years of passenger landing statistics and five years of reconstructed itineraries. 
The five year reconstruction extends from the 2003-04 season to 2007-08 – a period which saw a sharp increase in tourism related activities. The paper provides a useful insight on the implications of any further increase in activity while recognizing that the marked drop in tourism that began in the 2008-2009 season is expected to continue for a further two or three seasons. 
From a management perspective, detailed knowledge of patterns of tour ship traffic and landings provides data useful for:

    • Discussion of cumulative impact involving all human activities in the Peninsula region;
    • Prioritization of sites for future detailed monitoring programs; and
    • Discussion of strategic approaches to the development of future management tools and review of current management tools.

While this paper does not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. Government, the U.S.A. and IAATO are pleased to offer this paper to assist with the discussions at both CEP XIII and ATCM XXXIII.
