Report on the Evacuation of an Injured Expeditioner at Zhongshan Station
Submitted by China

An expeditioner of CHINARE 26 at Zhongshan Station of China suffered abdominal injury in the course of construction on January 8, 2010. Because of the limited medical resources at Chinese Zhongshan Station, we decided to seek help from the nearby Progress Station of Russia. With the swift reply from the Russian Progress Station, the injured expeditoner was transferred to the Progress Station after necessary medical treatment. The doctors from China and Russia consulted and decided an immediate operation was very necessary. 

During the time period of preparing the operation, Mr. Mark, the vice station leader of Australian Davis Station, and the other two doctors of the Davis Station, arrived at the Progress Station for help. 

The doctors from three different countries, Australia, Russia and China, performed the timely operation for the total time of 9 hours and 45 minutes. The operation was successful and the injured expeditioner was saved out of danger.

When the injured expeditioner’s condition and the weather condition permitted, he was transported to Hobart on Jan. 12, by means of S76, C212 and A319 with great endeavors of Australian Antarctic Division. The injured expeditioner received proper treatment in Royal Hobart Hospitalis. On Feb.21, the injured expeditioner returned to china for further treatment with the aid of international SOS. 

We would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration, to thank Australian Antarctic Division and Russian Antarctic Expedition for their efforts and arrangements to save our injured expeditioner. We believe this rapid response to emergency follow the Antarctic Spirit of cooperation and embody the friendship among us.
