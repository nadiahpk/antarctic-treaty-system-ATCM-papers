Tourism and Land-based Facilities in Antarctica: Analysis of a Questionnaire Distributed to Antarctic Treaty Parties at XXXII ATCM1
Summary 
This document summarizes the results of a questionnaire on tourism use of land-based facilities operated by Antarctic Treaty Parties distributed at XXXII ATCM.  Out of 30 Antarctic Treaty Parties (both ATCPs and NCPs) operating 111 Antarctic facilities, eight Parties operating 12 facilities responded the questionnaire.  The respondents were representative of all Antarctic Treaty Parties that run facilities in all parts of the region. None of the respondents provides any support to tourism other than free basic hospitality.  Most respondents opposed the notion of Parties being involved in tourism operations.  No Party reported to be aware of land-based facilities from other Parties being used for tourism purposes in their area of operations.  However, two of the eight responses indicated that one or more National Antarctic Programs (other than the respondents) possibly transport and/or accommodate tourists.  ASOC would appreciate the inputs of all Parties that have not yet done so to respond to the questionnaire attached to this information paper.
    1. Overview
This document summarizes the results of a questionnaire on tourism use of land-based facilities operated by Antarctic Treaty Parties distributed by ASOC at XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in 2009.  The questionnaire aims to obtain information on the tourism use of land-based facilities based on the experience and observations of Antarctic Treaty Parties active in the Antarctic.  
At ATCM XXXI Japan noted that it “would welcome IAATO and ASOC to come to ATCM XXXII with as much information as possible and an analysis of land-based facilities.”2 Japan also requested all Parties “…to verify such information and to provide supplementary information.”3 Responding to this request, at ATCM XXXII ASOC submitted IP023 Tourism and Land-based Facilities in Antarctica.  XXXII ATCM/IP023 focused on Antarctic land-based facilities used to support and/or manage tourism, whether by Antarctic Treaty Parties or private interests, both commercial and non-commercial.  Based on the comments received by some Parties ASOC submitted a revised version (XXXII ATCM/IP023 rev.1).4 
This document analyses a questionnaire appended to XXXII ATCM/IP023 rev.1.  The analysis is based on the responses received by ASOC between May 2009 and March 2010.  An overview of the respondents’ profile is included in Appendix 1. The respondents have been kept anonymous.  The questionnaire responses are summarized in Appendix 2.  The questionnaire is included in Appendix 3.
    2. Methods
Data collection
A hard copy of the questionnaire appended to XXXII ATCM/IP023 rev.1 was distributed by among all Parties during XXXII ATCM at the Tourism Working Group in May 2009.  
A slightly revised version of the questionnaire was distributed in January 2010 among all Parties that had not answered the original questionnaire, eliciting a further response.  This document analyses the responses received using both versions of the questionnaire.
Data analysis
Seven responses were received between May and November 2009.  These responses were analyzed and a document summarizing them was submitted at the CEP Tourism Study 2009-2010 in December 2009.
In the original questionnaire Question 1 was originally formulated as: “Does your program have a policy for tourism use of your land-based facilities?”.  When analysing responses to the questionnaire it became apparent that the phrasing of this question was somewhat ambiguous so that the question could be interpreted in two ways:  
    • Meaning 1: Literally, it may mean whether or not a Party has a policy for tourism visits at its land-based facilities, regardless of the content of this policy.  For instance, some Parties may have a policy of limiting the annual number of visits at its stations; other Parties may not have any policy on tourism visits as its stations are outside the tourism circuit.   
    • Meaning 2: The question can also be interpreted in the sense of whether or not a Party is encouraging or supporting tourism at its facilities in some way.  
In all but one of the seven responses received between March and November 2009 it was possible to ascertain which interpretation the respondents used, based on accompanying comments.  A revised version of the questionnaire was produced resolving this ambiguity. In the revised questionnaire (distributed in January 2010 and reproduced in Appendix 3) Question 1 was split into two:  
    a. “Does your program have a policy for tourism use of your land-based facilities?”; and 
    b. “Does your program encourage or support tourism use of your land-based facilities (other than allowing brief visits, purchases at gift shops, and use of postal services)?”
    3. Results
Respondents’ profile
Thirty Antarctic Treaty Parties operate 111 facilities in Antarctica.5  Of these, twenty-eight are Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties and two are Non-Consultative Parties.  Eight Antarctic Treaty Parties responded to ASOC’s questionnaire representing 27% of all Parties operating in Antarctica; 29% of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties; and the operators of 11% of all Antarctic facilities.   
Overall, the respondents are broadly representative of Antarctic Treaty Parties; of the global spread of Antarctic nations; and of the total number of Antarctic facilities in all parts of the region.  
Overview of responses 
Question 1 - Does your program have a policy for tourism use of your land-based facilities? Does your program encourage or support tourism use of your land-based facilities (other than allowing brief visits, purchases at gift shops, and use of postal services)?
The answers to the this question were as follows:
    • Three Parties responded that they have a tourism policy for their stations, while the remaining five did not; and
    • Seven Parties responded explicitly or implicitly that they do not support tourism, while in the case of one Party the intent of the response was uncertain. 
Overall, no Party expressed support for Parties encouraging or supporting tourism, whether implicitly or explicitly.  In addition:
    • One Party noted that they do not have a policy on tourism but are strongly opposed to tourism at their stations and are drafting a policy in this regard; 
    • One Party described a policy statement in place that limits the extent of support to tourist and other non-governmental activities to humanitarian assistance and basic hospitality; and 
    • Another Party expressed its position on tourism in a separate note, stating that in its view governments should not actively encourage or promote Antarctic tourism, let alone organise tourism activities in Antarctica themselves.  
Question 2 - Please list the use or uses by tourists and/or tour operators of land-based facilities operated by your program:
    • Three Parties responded that tourists did not use their facilities.  However, one of these Parties noted that air tourism transfers were “possibly” taking place “in cooperation with other nations” and provided further verbal information.  This answer was analysed under Question 4; 
    • Five Parties responded that tourists used their facilities for basic hospitality, use of gift shop and post office, or the stamping of passports; and 
    • The question was not applicable to the case of one Party.
Question 3 - Are these facilities used by tourists and/or tour operators on commercial bases (excluding purchases at gift shops and use of postal services)?
    • Seven Parties responded that the use of their facilities by tourists, as in the previous question, was not conducted on a commercial basis (excluding purchases at gift shops and use of postal services). 
    • The question was not applicable to the case of one Party.
Question 4 - Are you aware of land-based facilities (not belonging to your program) that are used for tourism purposes in your area of operations?
    • No Party responded positively to this question;  
    • Six Parties responded that they were not aware of land-based facilities from other National Antarctic Programs being used for tourism purposes.  However, one of these Parties noted under Question 2 that air tourism transfers were “possibly” taking place “in cooperation with other nations” and provided further verbal information; 
    • One Party did not answer “yes” or “no” to this question, but suggested “checking” a nearby station, which it identified by its name and operator; and
    • One Party responded that the question was not applicable in its case.
Question 5 - Any other comment about this topic?
    • Two Parties provided additional written comments stating their position or current policy on tourism.  
    • One Party representative provided additional verbal comments about possible air transfers of tourists.
    4. Closing remarks
Although a relatively small number of Parties responded to ASOC’s questionnaire, the respondents were representative of all Antarctic Treaty Parties that run facilities in all parts of the region.  
None of the respondents provides any support to tourism other than free basic hospitality, and most respondents explicitly opposed the notion of Parties being involved in tourism operations.  No Party reported to be aware of land-based facilities from other Parties being used for tourism purposes in their area of operations.  However, two of the eight responses indicated that one or more National Antarctic Programs (other than the respondents) possibly transport and/or accommodate tourists.  
The responses suggest that the use of land-based facilities operated by Antarctic Treaty Parties for tourism purposes is not regarded as appropriate by a representative number of Parties.  Yet, it is possible that other Parties think differently and use their transport and/or accommodation facilities for tourism. 
ASOC requests Parties that have not already done so to respond to the questionnaire included in Appendix 3.  Responding to the questionnaire is one way of obtaining the information that has been requested by several Parties at the ATCMs and by observers conducting inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol.6  This information would also be of interest to the ongoing CEP tourism study.
