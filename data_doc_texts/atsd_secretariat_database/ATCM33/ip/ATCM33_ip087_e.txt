Two recent International Climate Change Scientific Events held in Chile





Two recent International Climate Change Scientific Events held in Chile
Introduction
Earth’s atmosphere is experiencing unprecedented changes that are modifying global climate. Hence climate change and effects of its dynamic processes motivates nowadays a global awareness and great interest of scientific community. Some of the most dynamic cryospheric changes are occurring in the southern hemisphere, including the Andes, the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica. Patagonia and particularly the Antarctic Peninsula regions are among the areas that have been experiencing the most dramatic regional climate changes in recent times. Therefore, this sector of the earth draws the attention of scientists all over the world who are willing to record these changes and improve their understanding at the regional and global scales. Consequently, this territory can be seen as a natural laboratory where it is offered the opportunity to study the enhanced climate change phenomenon along its stretched latitudinal gradient.
Two international scientific events were recently organized by Chilean institutions in order to join relevant scientists and to contribute to the advance of the scientific knowledge in these subjects. Both events are presented in this document.
1. The international Colloquium “Climate Change in Magellan and Antarctic Regions: Evidence and Challenges for the Future”
The international Colloquium “Climate Change in Magellan and Antarctic Regions: Evidence and Challenges for the Future” (www.umag.cl/cambioclimatico) was held in Punta Arenas during 27-31 October, 2009. It was organized by the University of Magallanes (UMAG) and the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), being supported by the Regional Division of the National Commission for Science and Technology (CONICYT – FICR) and the Magallanes Regional Government. 
This meeting gathered together an important group of international scientific experts on this matter, which came from Australia, Brazil, Chile, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States of America, with a wide audience of local authorities, decision makers, academics, students and general public. Using a format of invited keynote speakers presentations, followed by round table discussion, four main sessions were programmed: 
    • Paleoclimatic and Glaciological Evidence of Regional Climate Change,
    • Modeling and Prediction of the Regional Climate Change,
    • Effects of Climate Change on Regional Biodiversity, and
    • Climate Change Opportunities for Collaborative Research. 

A number of resulting products can be highlighted as like: a special volume with the presentation’s papers that will be published in the Anales del Instituto de la Patagonia journal, the on-line Internet broadcasting of presentations transmitted through the academic REUNA consortium network and the public statement of the “Magallanes Declaration” (see Annex A). 
This proclamation endorses the recognition of the scientific value of the region and express the decision concerning to the establishment of a Magallanes and Antarctica climate change and biodiversity research network. At the same time, send a call to all relevant national and international bodies to contribute substantial resources to implement long-term research on climate, glaciers and biodiversity in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments, to improve current monitoring efforts, and to strengthen existing partnerships between scientific institutions in the region. In this context, it is necessary that government and academic institutions define and coordinate a set of common objectives, aimed at addressing the ecological, social and economic impact of climate change. The colloquium, based on regional evidence and future scientific challenges, showed the state-of-the-art of the understanding of phenomenon and proved to be a precious opportunity to motivate the dialogue and the discussion from different knowledge’s perspectives around the topic of climate change. 

2. International Glaciological Conference "Ice and Climate Change: A View from the South" (VICC 2010)
The glaciological Conference "Ice and Climate Change: A View from the South" (VICC 2010) (www.cecs.cl/vicc/) was held in Valdivia between 1 and 3 of February, 2010. The Conference was sponsored by Imagen de Chile Foundation and was organized by the Center for Scientific Studies (CECS). Co-sponsors included the Climate and Cryosphere Project (CliC) of WCRP-IASC-SCAR, the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS), the Snow and Ice Working Group for Latin America of the International Hydrological Programme of UNESCO (IHP-GTNH), the International Glaciological Society (IGS), the Center for Advanced Studies in Arid Zones (CEAZA), CONICYT, through its Bicentennial Science and Technology Programme, the Centro de Ingeniería de la Innovación (CIN) and Millennium Science Initiative (ICM). Concurrently CliC (Scientific Steering Group), IHP-GTNH (national representatives) and APECS (Association of Polar Early Career Scientists) hold official meetings during the Conference.
The objectives of the Conference were to present new results and discuss ongoing cryospheric and climate changes in the Southern Hemisphere and their impacts and consequences on society and the environment. Although the main focus was glaciology and climatology, interdisciplinary discussion about climate change through the contribution of other disciplines in earth sciences and social sciences were developed. Some of the key questions addressed were: 
    • What is the current extension of the cryosphere in the Southern hemisphere and what changes it is presently experiencing? 
    • Is climate the main driver of these cryospheric changes? 
    • What is the role of non-climatic factors such as ice dynamics? 
    • Is there cyclicity to present ice-climate changes or are we experiencing secular trends due to anthropogenic forcing? 
    • Can we identify tipping points in the Earth-climate system? 
    • What are the present and future impacts of these cryospheric changes? 
    • What are the primary similarities and differences when contrasted with the cryospheric components of the Northern hemisphere? 
    • How is the society responding to climate change issues? 
    • How can we address climate changes in a way that is also compatible with other urgent development needs?
    • What can be achieved by the general public in order to tackle this problem? 
The opening ceremony was lead by the former President of the Republic of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, who expressed that it was the first international conference in glaciology after the Copenhagen Summit on Climate Change, emphasizing the major contribution being made by the scientific community, acknowledging its crucial role in creating a worldwide awareness of the seriousness of the problem of global warming and how imperative it is for Chileans to take steps in order to halt it. The former President also stressed that work of the scientists has to be untiring as it will be critical to underpin the difficult decisions that political leaders all over the world will have to take within the next few years and in the forthcoming decades.
