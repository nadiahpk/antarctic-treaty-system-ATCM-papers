The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS):  Shaping the Future of Polar Research

Background
Established in 2006 during the planning stages of the International Polar Year, the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) has evolved into the pre-eminent international organization supporting polar researchers in the beginning or early stages of their careers.
APECS represents an international and interdisciplinary body of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, early faculty members, educators and others with interests in Polar Regions and the wider cryosphere.
APECS’ mission is “to raise the profile of polar research by providing a continuum of leadership that is both international and interdisciplinary in focus, and to stimulate collaborative projects in research and outreach.”
APECS provides a strong voice for young researchers, enabling information sharing between early-career and more established professionals, promoting and organizing science, education and outreach events, and being actively involved with other polar organizations in the support of polar research. 
APECS pursues three overarching goals:
    • Facilitate international and interdisciplinary networking to share ideas and experiences and to develop new research directions and collaborations;
    • Provide opportunities for professional career development; and
    • Promote education and outreach as integral components of polar research and to stimulate future generations of polar researchers.
The Structure of APECS
APECS is governed through democratically elected officers working together in an Executive Committee and an open Council and a directorate similar to an organizational secretariat that is responsible for day-to-day operations, sustaining continuity and strategic planning.  Furthermore, professional advice and support from senior colleagues is provided through an Advisory Committee. 
Council
The APECS Council, guided by a Council Charter, is composed of individual members who are (self-) nominated and approved by the Executive Committee.  Council members contribute to the smooth implementation of APECS activities and contribute regularly to the monthly newsletter, job postings and website content. 
Executive Committee 
Annually elected by the Council, the Executive Committee manages the organization and approves major decisions, in consultation with the Council.  The Executive Committee facilitates project development and works closely with the Council, Committees and Working Groups to implement new initiatives and assure information exchange and oversees the Directorate.
Directorate 
The APECS Directorate represents the physical secretariat of APECS and is located in Tromsø, Norway.  Providing continuity and serving as the main point of contact for the organization, the Directorate is critical to the success of APECS and ensures the transfer of institutional knowledge which is critical for an early-career organization whose members and leaders turn over quickly.  The Directorate is currently sponsored by the University of Tromsø, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Research Council and the Tromsø Kommune with funding confirmed until June 2011.  APECS is seeking additional funding to maintain its Directorate beyond June 2011 and is working to develop a sustainable funding plan.
Standing Committees
Research Activities Committee 
The Research Activities Committee links APECS and international scientific groups such as the Permafrost Young Researchers Network.  Structured by research disciplines with an overarching, cross-disciplinary leadership, the Research Activities Committee ensures the sharing of information from various disciplines with the entire APECS membership and encourages cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary cooperation. 
Education and Outreach Committee 
The Education and Outreach Committee is responsible for helping APECS disseminate information to wide audiences of all ages and provide support to national education and outreach programmes.  One key activity of the Education and Outreach Committee has been the creation of the IPY book: Polar Science and Global Climate: An International Resource for Education and Outreach to be released in June 2010.
National Committees
APECS encourages and supports the formation of national chapters which facilitate the strengthening of national networks of early-career polar researchers and coordinate polar career development, education and outreach activities on a national level.  Active national committees exist in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Working Groups
Working groups typically consist of 3-10 individuals cooperating on a clearly outlined project.  They enable individual APECS members, or groups of members, to focus on an activity or projects related to the polar regions or the wider cryosphere and develop a process and timeline for implementation.  Currently, working groups exist for APECS’ mentoring programme, field sites initiative, establishing an acronym definitions database and climate change education in various languages.
Partnerships and collaborations
Since its inception, APECS has strived to develop a strong network of partnerships with international polar organizations and scientific bodies.  In 2008, APECS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC).  As a result of the MoU, APECS was invited to nominate delegates for all SCAR standing scientific groups, research projects and conference planning committees.  The APECS representatives on SCAR committees serve as a valuable link between both organizations. In addition to close partnerships with SCAR and IASC, APECS works with a number of other polar and scientific organizations in various capacities, examples of which are listed in Appendix A. 
Capacity building, education and outreach 
The core of APECS’ work focuses on capacity building aimed at students and early-career researchers as well as education and outreach regarding polar research.  Capacity building takes various forms – from the organization of field schools to participation in international conferences (as detailed in Appendix B) to a dedicated mentorship programme, career development workshops and virtual poster sessions.
Career development workshops
APECS has initiated a number of interdisciplinary career development workshops, which SCAR and other organisations often co-sponsor.  The workshops encourage the sharing of ideas, concerns and expectations and, through a series of devoted presentations and practical sessions, help early-career researchers gain valuable insight from more experienced colleagues (see Appendix C).
Field schools 
APECS has participated in the organization of various polar field schools and plays an active role in helping members find funding to attend these programmes.  The APECS Field School Network, linked via the APECS website, is a community of connected field schools concerned with the polar regions, the cryosphere and climate change.  APECS co-organised an APECS/IARC International Field School at Bellingshausen Station, Antarctica in January 2010 and an APECS/UNIS/UArctic Interdisciplinary IPY Polar Field School in Svalbard (June – July 2009).  Two more Arctic field schools are planned for 2010 and 2011.  APECS is also working with Students On Ice to create additional opportunities for young researchers to learn about and experience the polar regions.
Mentorship programme
Launched in February 2010, this initiative is an extension of the mentor panels that APECS runs at major conferences.  The mentorship programme provides an unprecedented opportunity for more experienced polar researchers and professionals to network with early-career researchers and share their experience and advice.  As part of this programme, APECS has created an online database of mentors (http://apecs.is/mentors) who are willing to share their knowledge with and offer guidance to talented early-career researchers. 
Virtual poster session 
Sponsored by a grant from the Nordic Council of Ministers, the virtual poster session is an initiative aimed at bringing the poster presentation beyond the walls of the conference hall and creating an online database of polar research poster publications open to the public.  It enables APECS members to discuss their results in a collegial fashion during conference calls, receive feedback from peers, improve their presentation skills and establish new collaborations.  Visit http://apecs.is/virtual-poster-session for more information.
Education and outreach 
APECS provides regular updates about its activities through a monthly newsletter, emails and its website (http://apecs.is), which also serves as a platform for community outreach and communication.  Individual APECS members contribute to outreach activities by giving talks to schools and the wider public and by contributing to initiatives such as the IPY Polar Resource Book, which has been developed in collaboration between the APECS and IPY Education and Outreach Committees.  Further projects such as an APECS Polar Policy Essay Contest, coordinated in collaboration with the Antarctic Treaty Summit International Board, and Frost Bytes, an initiative by APECS and US National Science Foundation’s Arctic System Science Thermakarst (ARCSS TK) research project, are actively reaching out to the community by engaging elementary, high-school and tertiary students and the wider public.  Frost Bytes, for instance, involves the creation of a series of short audio and video messages from researchers working to help understand the coldest regions of our planet.
Sustaining APECS into the future
The International Polar Year has encouraged many new enthusiastic and talented young researchers to commit to polar research pathways in order to help better understand the world’s polar systems.  This motivation and momentum needs to be retained by 
    • securing funding for research in polar regions;
    • an adaptation of academia to changing societal needs and education and outreach activities; and
    • maintaining and expanding joint efforts to develop leadership and career skills. 
The APECS membership body is eager to make lasting and committed contributions in pursuit of these goals, but to achieve extensive societal benefits and sustained success requires strong national and international partnerships.
