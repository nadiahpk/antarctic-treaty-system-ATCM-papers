New State of the Art Polar Research and Supply Vessel for South Africa





New State of the Art Polar Research and Supply Vessel for South Africa

The South African Department of Environmental Affairs signed a contract with STX Finland Oy on 17 November 2009 for the construction of a Polar Research and Supply Vessel. This vessel will be built in their Rauma Shipyard at a cost of about EUR 116 million. The vessel will replace the 1977 Mitsubishi built      ice-strengthened research/supply ship, the SA Agulhas. The SA Agulhas has had a very successful ’career’ servicing the research bases in the Southern Ocean and on the Antarctic continent managed by the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP). The ’new’ ship will be a multi-purpose vessel and it will carry 100 passengers, 4000 m³ of cargo space to supply the three remote stations, carry two Super Puma class helicopters and have approximately 800m² dedicated space for research laboratories to do deep water oceanographic and geological research cruises to depths of 6000 metres. It will also carry six specialist container laboratories and keep continous record of weather data for meteorological institutions around the world.



The Key Dimensions of this ‘new ship are:

Length overall	      134.00 m 
Length between perpendiculars	         121.25 m 
Breadth, moulded  	21.70 m 
Depth to Upper Deck, moulded  	13.55 m 
Depth to Main Deck, moulded  	10.55 m 
Design draft  	7.65 m 
Deadweight at design draught, (about)	         5 020 t
Gross Tonnage (about) 	      12 000   
Service Speed 	    14.0 knots
Speed in 1.0 m level ice                        	      5.0 knots
Passengers        	                  100
Crew	                    44
Cargo hold capacity	          4 000 m3

Class notation: + 1A1, ICE CLASS IACS PC5, WINTERISED BASIC, DAT(-35), EO, RP,           HELDEK-SHF,CLEAN DESIGN,COMF V(2)/C(2),NAUT-AW,TMON, BIS,        DYNPOS-AUT, DE-ICE, LFL 
Note: Structure DNV ICE-10
Flag: 	   South Africa
Number of passenger cabins:	46
Number of crew cabins:           								     41

The above Classifications Notations cover such elements as:

    • Compliance with SOLAS 2010 Rules pertaining to Safe Return to Port
    • Navigate through 1 meter first year ice at 5 knots
    • Ability of the vessel to maintain a Geo-stationary position without the use of any mooring equipment via a dynamic positioning system
    • Navigate with one person on the bridge   
    • To be inspected In Water hence extending the periods between visits to dry-dock
    • The vessel’s redundant Propulsion and unmanned machinery spaces
    • Carry low flashpoint liquids (polar diesel, helicopter fuel, petrol) in designated spaces
    • This ship will most likely to be the first ship to comply with the 2010 SOLAS Regulations         (safe-Return-to-Port).

Principle Particulars of the new build are as follows:

Overall Length			134.0m
Breadth moulded		21.7m
Design draft			7.65m
Deadweight			5 000 T
Propulsion	Diesel electric, twin screw CPP.  4 x 3 00 kW generator set, 2 x 4 500 kW propulsion motors
Thrusters		2 x 600 kW bow thrusters, 1 x 800 kW stern thruster
Speed		14 knots cruising, 5 knots in 1 metre ice
Range and endurance	1500 nautical miles, 90 days

The ship will further have two gyms, a library, an Auditorium, a Business Centre and a well equiped three bed hospital.
According to the shipyard this is one of the biggest individual civil trade agreements Finland has made with South Africa. SANAP is extremely pleased with this development. Allocating this level of funding for the new vessel despite the current pressure on the national fiscus reflects the South African Government‘s commitment to not only the South African National Antarctic Programme but also to research addressing global concerns like climate change. The new ship, apart from its supply function, will be a catalyst to rebuild the deep-sea oceanography capacity in South Africa. This would also attract participation of international scientists and researchers, thus significantly contributing to research projects addressing new challenges and changing interests, for instance, climate change research.
While most cruises will be undertaken in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic Waters, the ship is also designed to operate in tropical waters to enhance its ability to serve a wider user community.
