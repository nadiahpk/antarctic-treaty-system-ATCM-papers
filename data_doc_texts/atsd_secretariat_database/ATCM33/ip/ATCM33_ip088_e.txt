Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) Report to ATCM XXXIII






Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) Report to ATCM XXXIII 
Executive Summary
1.	Introduction
This report provides an overview of COMNAP's current activities. 2009 continued to be a year in transition for COMNAP under the new way of working and new constitution. 
2.	Supporting Science
There is often a misconception that COMNAP’s sole focus is logistics. Today, COMNAP’s mission is much broader, since the Managers of National Antarctic Programs control more than the logistics of their respective programs.
Increasingly complex science questions are being poised which can only be answered by multi-disciplinary and often multi-national science teams.  This complexity, along with more demanding environmental measures and, in some cases, reduced funding, contribute to added pressure on National Antarctic Programs and to an even greater need for international collaboration. COMNAP works in support of greater collaboration between National Antarctic Programs and recognises the need for robust partnerships with organisations with similar goals.
3.	Supporting the Antarctic Treaty System
COMNAP was, in 1991, given the status of Observer at ATCMs.
4.	COMNAP Constitution 
COMNAP’s Constitution states that our purpose is “To develop and promote best practice in managing the support of scientific research in Antarctica”.  COMNAP membership is only open to those organisations with national responsibility for managing the support of scientific research in the Antarctic Treaty Area on behalf of their respective governments, which must have signed the Antarctic Treaty and ratified its Protocol on Environmental Protection. 
For further information, see: ATCM XXXII IP078 COMNAP's 20 years: a New Constitution and a New Way of Working to Continue Supporting Science and the Antarctic Treaty System.
5.	COMNAPs Restructure
In conjunction with the new Constitution, COMNAP adopted in St Petersburg, a new way of working. Development and implementation of this new way of working is still in progress. So that 2009/2010 is a year in transition for COMNAP. New rules of procedure have been developed and are in the process of review and will be discussed at the upcoming COMNAP Annual General Meeting in August 2010.
In support of the COMNAP objective to facilitate and promote international partnerships, there is recognition that strategic partnerships with other key Antarctic organizations are important to COMNAP as an organization.  To support this, COMNAP has created standing items within the tasks of its Executive Committee (EXCOM) to develop and support key relationships with the CEP, SCAR and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.

7.	An overview of COMNAP activities and services
7.1	COMNAP Ship Position Reporting System (SPRS)
The COMNAP SPRS is an optional, voluntary system for exchange of information about National Program ship operations and capabilities. Its primary purpose is to facilitate collaboration between National Programs.
7.2	Review of the Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM) 
The AFIM is a handbook of aeronautical information published by COMNAP as recommended by the ATCM Recommendation XV-20 Air safety in Antarctica. 
An in-depth review of the AFIM was conducted in 2008-2009. Now, the results of that review are being considered as a strategic project for 2009-2010. 
7.3	Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM)
The ATOM is an evolution of the handbook of telecommunications practices that ATCM Recommendation X-3 Improvement of Telecommunications in Antarctica and the Collection and Distribution of Antarctic Meteorological Data refers to - it is no longer limited to stations and ships. It now also includes contact details for National Antarctic Programs, Search and Rescue (SAR) authorities and a number of other stakeholders. COMNAP members and SAR authorities have access to the latest version (August 2009) at http://www.comnap.aq/atom.
7.4	Accident, Incident and Near-Miss Reporting (AINMR)
Information on problems encountered in Antarctica has always been exchanged. The very first ATCM recommended in Recommendation I-VII Exchange of Information on Logistics Problems that this should be so. 
COMNAP AGMs offer an opportunity for Members to exchange such information and also a new, comprehensive AINMR system is under development as one of COMNAP's strategic projects. 
7.5	Hydrographic surveying using ships of opportunity
COMNAP worked with the Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) to develop a “Collection and Rendering of Hydrographic Data Form” that can be used by ships of opportunity operating in the Antarctic. A presentation by the HCA was also made at the COMNAP AGM in August 2009 in Punta Arenas, Chile. A COMNAP representative, Henry Valentine (SANAP) attended the HCA9.
7.6	Information Exchange
The COMNAP infoX electronic information exchange system will manage a range of dynamic information on National Antarctic Program capabilities and activities. 
There have been many delays to the completion and deployment of the COMNAP infoX system. It is currently still under development and not ready for implementation.
7.7	SCAR/COMNAP Action Group
As a result of the joint SCAR/COMNAP Executive Committee Meeting held in August in Punta Arenas, Chile, SCAR/COMNAP have formed an Action Group which met for the first time in March 2010.  
Work on this important relationship will continue and will be reported at the COMNAP AGM and the SCAR Meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in August 2010.
7.8	Collaboration with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat
The COMNAP and Antarctic Treaty Secretariats have developed and maintained a close and constructive working relationship and discuss a number of practical matters as and when appropriate. 
7.9	Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME) on the Management of Ship-bourne Tourism in the Antarctic Treaty Area
COMNAP attended the ATME and presented IP10 Search and Rescue Coordination and Response in the Antarctic: Workshop Discussions.  
7.10	Antarctic Treaty Summit
The Chair and the Executive Secretary of COMNAP attended the Antarctic Treaty Summit in Washington D.C. The COMNAP Chair delivered a presentation entitled The Role of COMNAP as part of the Summit session entitled “International Cooperation in Antarctica”.
