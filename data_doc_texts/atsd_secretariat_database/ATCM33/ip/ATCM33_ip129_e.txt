Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in Ushuaia during the 2009/2010 austral summer season 

Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and vessels that visited Antarctica during 2009/2010, operating from the port of Ushuaia.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic shipborne tourism, and it concentrates more than the 90% of the worldwide Antarctic tourist activity.   
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend their Antarctic operating schedules.  
With respect to the vessels that operate from Ushuaia, a distinction should be made between those that make landings and those of a much larger size which just sail Antarctic waters without landing passengers. Similarly, a further distinction should be made between those large vessels which arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia as the port of base from which they run their Antarctic voyages.  
In general terms, these operations refer to passenger turnaround, port and land services as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist services. Also, at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic season most vessels arrive at the port of Ushuaia and/or depart on a positioning voyage from or towards other destinations.
In order to present the status of Antarctic tourist flows of visitors and vessels in Ushuaia in the 2009/2010 season, data was collected from the manifests provided by cruise ships to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority). Information from the manifests was compared to itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained from enquiries whenever needed. 

Brief summary of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships which operated in Ushuaia during the 2009/2010 austral summer season 
Antarctic tour operators started operating at the port of Ushuaia on October 23rd 2009, when the IB Kapitan Khlebnikov (Quark Expeditions) set sail from Ushuaia for Antarctica, and finished on March 30th 2010 with the arrival of the MV Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions) from the Antarctic Peninsula. 
Out of 2251 scheduled Antarctic voyages calling at the port of Ushuaia, 2022 were actually run by 35 vessels, including the SV Bark Europa and the MY Hanse Explorer. January is the busiest month as regards the number of Antarctic voyages (39 %) followed by February (25 %) and December (23 %) (See figure 1).

Source: data collected from 2009/2010 manifests, Argentine Maritime Authority.
A total of 33.526 visitors went to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2009/2010 season. Of these, three groups can be identified: a) those that both departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is to say, passengers who were in Ushuaia once either on the arrival or departure- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports.   
In the first case, 19.084 visitors both embarked and disembarked at the port of Ushuaia, accounting for 57 % of the overall total, and involving 174 calls at the port. For this group, passengers were counted only upon departure from Ushuaia.  
In the second case, 2.737 visitors either embarked or disembarked at the port of Ushuaia, and they account for 8 % of the total, involving 17 calls at the port. Several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, and many visited Antarctica as part of the trip of the beginning or end of the season, and then operated from Ushuaia the rest of the season. In this instance the passengers who arrived at or departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account.
Finally, 11.705 visitors were in-transit passengers, and they account for 35 % of the total distributed in 11 port calls in Ushuaia. This category includes the MS Deutschland and the MV Vistamar which carried less than 500 passengers. On the other hand, the other vessels in transit carried more than 500 passengers and cruised in Antarctica only without making any landings. Their visit to the Antarctic Peninsula was just part of a longer voyage in South America or a more extensive itinerary. These vessels were: MS Amsterdam, MS Prinsendam, MS Veendam, MV Star Princess, MV Crystal Symphony, MV The Oceanic and MV Seven Seas Mariner.  Passengers in transit were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the East or West direction of the cruise ship when calling at the port of Ushuaia.  It may be worth mentioning that the MV Celebrity Infinity had planned to visit the Antarctic Peninsula area on two out of her six itineraries, but had to cancel due to bad weather conditions.
Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. A distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Measure 15 (2009) in the Antarctic Treaty System, which recommends: “Parties shall require their operators organizing tourist or other non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area (…) to refrain from making any landings in Antarctica from vessels carrying more than 500 passengers”. Therefore, taking into account the average number of passengers on board, it is noticed that 80 % (28 vessels) belongs to cruise ships which carried up to 500 or fewer passengers whereas the other 20 % (7 vessels) correspond to vessels that carried more than 500 passengers. An average number of crew members and passengers as well as the number of voyages of each vessel are presented in table 1; and in figure 2 passenger averages per vessel are shown.

Furthermore, 14 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they represent the 39% of the total number of vessels.  Each vessel made between 7 and 12 voyages to Antarctica, as indicated in figure 3. These vessels carried an average number of 106 passengers per voyage, ranging from 235 to 54, these being the highest and lowest number of passengers on board (see table 1). It is worth noticing that the MV Professor Multanovskiy operated in a different way during December when she conducted some voyages from 25 de Mayo Island, embarking passengers who arrived from Punta Arenas by airplane. On November 22nd she left Ushuaia carrying passengers towards South Shetland Islands, and returned to the port of Ushuaia on January 6th, also carrying passengers from Antarctica. From then onwards she continued operating from Ushuaia.

With regard to vessels in transit in Ushuaia, most of them are large cruise ships which cruise Antarctic waters but do not make passenger landings in Antarctica.  As it has been previously stated, these cruise ships are on itineraries round southern South America or on more extensive voyages, and on certain itineraries, they include a visit to Antarctica.  Most of these cruise ships run “pendular” voyages along Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and to visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 2 below provides an overview of the movement of these cruise ships through Ushuaia including the number of crew and passengers per voyage.

As regards visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers who travelled in vessels carrying less than 500 passengers were counted. In this respect, 74 nationalities were identified. Most of the passengers are from the United States, followed by Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan, among others. Percentages are presented in figure 4.

Furthermore, it is interesting to consider the expedition staff members3 who may be included either on the crew or on the passenger lists. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, staff members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the landing activities. For this reason only staff members on board vessels which carry up to 500 passengers have been considered. It has been noted that staff are not always identified on the manifests and sometimes their positions on board are not stated. Most of the times staff members are included on the passenger manifest, in some cases they are on the crew list, and there are also other occasions where they are listed on both, as shown in table 3. It is worth recognising the role of the expedition staff as regards Measure 15 (2009) which recommends that “Parties shall require their operators organizing tourist or other non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area (…) in the case of vessels carrying 500 or fewer passengers (…) maintain a 1:20 guide-to-passenger ratio, unless a more restrictive ratio is otherwise specified in applicable ATCM measures”. Also, it could be noted that in some cases the presence of an ice master is stated on the manifests.

Concluding remarks
The information presented in this document contributes to identify the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the port of Ushuaia in the 2009/2010 summer season, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff, tour operators, vessel owners, ship management companies and the registers of ships.
It is worth mentioning that in the 2009/2010 Antarctic season the number of passengers to Antarctica has decreased5 7 % compared to the 2008/2009 season6. Furthermore, the number of voyages has also been reduced from 233 to 202; however, the number of vessels was practically the same: 36 for the 2008/2009 season and 35 for 2009/2010. Some of the vessels which operated during the 2008/2009 season did not operate in the 2009/2010 season whereas other vessels were involved.
Also, the number of vessels which operated Antarctica regularly from the port of Ushuaia was reduced from 21 in 2008/2009 to14 in the 2009/2010 season; nevertheless, the number of voyages per vessel, between 7 and 12, has remained the same.  
In the 2009/2010 season the overall number of visitors on board ships that carried more than 500 passengers which were cruise-only has increased, showing a variance of 17 % compared to the 2008/2009 season.
As regards visitors’ nationalities in the last two seasons, United States holds the first position, having increased the number of passengers significantly by 13 %; Germany in second place with an increase of 9 % and the United Kingdom has shown no variation.
Two new ship registries were identified with respect to the previous season, Belize and Union of the Comoros.
The information presented in this paper contributes to the assessment of ship-borne tourist activities in the Antarctic Peninsula region, focusing on the flows of Antarctic visitors and vessels that operate in the port of Ushuaia during the austral summer seasons.
