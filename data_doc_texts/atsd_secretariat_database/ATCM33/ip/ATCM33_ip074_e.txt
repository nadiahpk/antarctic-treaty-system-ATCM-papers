Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Under Extreme Conditions: Case Studies From Antarctica1


1. Two Decades of Experience 

Over the past two decades, facility managers of National Antarctic Programs have used a mix of different technologies and approaches to enhance energy efficiency and embrace renewable energy in Antarctic operations. Advanced energy management controls, robust energy efficiency measures, encouragement of behavioral change, low energy instrumentation, improved insulation, innovative snow removal techniques and cogeneration have contributed towards reducing energy demands. Solar collectors, solar panels and wind turbines have further reduced the need for fossil fuel. Energy efficiency measures, small-scale renewable energy applications, and management of energy needs through technical means and behavioral change have the added advantages of being flexible, portable, relatively cheap and requiring little infrastructure. The ambition to run entire stations or field camps on 100% renewable energy is increasingly common and feasible, though not entirely feasible at all locations.

Examples include:
    • Energy consumption at Rothera station has been reduced through changing space heating from electrical to hot water, retrofitting lighting systems, fitting freezers with energy saving devices, enhancing insulation within buildings and encouraging staff to actively save energy whenever possible. New buildings are optimized for minimum snowdrift in order to reduce the energy needed for snow clearance.

    • The walls and ceilings at Wasa station have 30-50 cm rock wool insulation, all windows are triple glazed and there are no windows facing south. Most of the power is generated by solar panels. Scientists and logisticians are very conscious about the limited power that they have at their disposal, and they get together to discuss their energy needs, energy conservation and alternatives prior to each field season.

    • All space heating needs at Concordia station are met using waste heat recovered from the cooling system and the exhaust of diesel generators.

    • Two commercial-size wind turbines at Mawson station have been functioning since 2002, resulting in fuel savings of around 30% per year. A wind turbine, specially designed for use on ice shelf, has been in use at Neumayer station since 1991. Its outstanding performance has led to the decision to construct five additional wind turbines coupled with a diesel generator to meet all of the electricity needs of the station. The diesel generator will only serve to backup the wind turbines and it is expected that only 25% of its full output will be needed over the course of the year. The new wind farm on Ross Island has the eventual goal of providing 100% of the energy of Scott Base and meeting part of the power requirements of McMurdo station.

    • Syowa station makes use of solar panels, solar collectors and a solar hot water system to provide energy for electricity, and air and water heating.

    • The summer energy needs of Princess Elisabeth station are designed to be met entirely by its nine wind turbines and over 300 m2 of solar panels. 

    • At Cape Royds, solar panels meet almost all of the energy needs of two researchers living and studying the penguin colony over a period of three months during summer each year. Low-power electronics, small-scale wind turbines and solar panels have enabled instrumentation to function in Antarctica continuously and autonomously throughout the year.

    • One of the earliest experiences of energy efficiency and renewable energy in Antarctica was the pilot alternative energy system used at Greenpeace’s World Park base operated in Ross Island between 1987 and 1992. The system combined solar and wind power, and through annual improvements eventually allowed for a considerable reduction in fuel consumption, with a peak reduction of approximately 36% for 19912.

Years of successful operation at these facilities demonstrate that even in one of the world’s most difficult environments, well designed and well-engineered energy efficiency programs can make a substantial contribution to reducing energy use, displacing imports and minimizing environmental impacts. 


2. Proven Economic Benefits

Although subject to methodological differences and uncertainties, economic cost-benefit analyses can be useful in providing some kind of indication of the costs and benefits of introducing energy efficiency and renewable energy in Antarctica. However, in Antarctica as elsewhere, the results of such analyses should be treated with care and considered only as indicators of parts of a complex reality.3 Despite the shortcomings of economic cost-benefit analyses, we hope that the following information provides an indication of some of the costs and benefits of renewable energy systems in Antarctica.

    • Undiscounted simple payback period for the wind farm project at Mawson station is estimated to be from 5 to 12 years, depending on assumptions made on the cost of fuel landed and stored in Antarctica. Since commissioning, the wind farm has provided an average annual fuel saving of around 32%, equivalent to a saving of 2918 t of carbon dioxide during the first six years of operation (Tin et al., in press). 

    • The hypothetical installation of nine 100 kW wind turbines at South Pole station is estimated to cost approximately US $4.3 million and would result in potential net savings of almost US $18 million over a 20-year project life (Baring-Gould et al., 2005). 

    • The possible installation of wind turbines of approximately 1MW at McMurdo is estimated to cost US $2–3 million. Total fuel consumption would potentially be reduced by between 600,000 and 1,200,000 l/year resulting in net savings of between US$1 million and US$4 million over a 20-year project life (presuming a simple undiscounted payback rate) (Baring-Gould et al., 2005). 

    • At SANAE IV station, the hypothetical installation of a 100 kW turbine is estimated to reduce the cost per kWh produced by potentially up to 20%, with a simple undiscounted payback period of about 10 years (Teetz et al., 2003). 

    • A flatplate solar thermal system at SANAE IV could potentially save over 10,000 liters of fuel annually and have a short payback period of 6 years (Teetz et al., 2003). 

Antarctic research stations are often designed for a lifetime of at least 20-25 years. Payback periods of 6-20 years are short in comparison. Such short payback periods should largely justify the costs of investing into energy efficiency and renewable energy applications, especially as more collective experience is accrued and best practices can be shared.  The compilation of a document of such best practices would be a positive step towards increasing the use of efficient and renewable technologies at research stations.
