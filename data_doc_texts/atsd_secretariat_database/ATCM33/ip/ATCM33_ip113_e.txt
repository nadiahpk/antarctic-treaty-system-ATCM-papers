IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2009-10 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2010-11 Antarctic Season and Beyond
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Introduction
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide an overview of Antarctic tourism for the recently completed 2009-10 season, estimates for the following season and some projected trends up to and including the 2012-13 Antarctic season.
Compared with the total number of visitors for the 2008-09 Antarctic tourism season (37,858), the total for the 2009-10 season dropped slightly to 36,881 (counting IAATO Member visitors only). Details of the 2009-10 season can be found in Appendix 1 of this paper.

Estimates for the 2010-11 season can be found in Appendix 3 of this paper. Overall, these estimates indicate a total of 34,168 visitors. As a result of the lingering effects of the world economy and recent amendments to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) MARPOL Annex I adopted at the 60th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), it also may be useful to look into the near-term future of Antarctic tourism, particularly ship-borne tourism.

1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As during the past 19 seasons, IAATO membership continues to incorporate the majority of recognized Antarctic private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS vessel-based operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty area are members of IAATO at the present time. All these operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National Authority.
A summary of IAATO member activities for the 2009-10 season follows:

    • 21,622 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area, a 19.7% reduction from the previous season. Of this total:
        ◦ 20,700 passengers landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area, 18.6% fewer than the previous season;
        ◦ 397 passengers landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica, down 61% from the previous season;
        ◦ 180 passengers sailed aboard yachts (sailing or motor) that carry 12 or fewer passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula, a 3.4% increase from the previous season;
        ◦ 345 passengers participated in air-cruise voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula area and flew from South America to King George Island to embark a vessel and cruise for six days, making landings. This represents a 21% increase from this segment.

    • 15,026 passengers traveled aboard large vessels operating “cruise-only” voyages, making no landings in the Antarctic Treaty Area. This is a 41% increase in the number of cruise-only passengers from the 2008-09 season.

    • 233 clients participated in multi-day land-based expeditions in the continental interior, a similar number to the previous season. However, this number includes for the first time visitors from new IAATO associate member The Antarctic Company (TAC) as well as longtime member ANI-ALE.

    • No passengers participated in IAATO-member over-flights to the Antarctic continent.


1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, running events, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. 
Appendices to this addendum provide further details of the scope of IAATO-member activities, including vessel/aircraft, departures, passenger numbers and activities. The appendices are as follows:

The vast majority of commercially operated voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the six-month austral summer season (from mid-October to early April), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Treaty Area. 

1.3	Nationalities
The nationalities of Antarctic visitors are derived from the Post Visit Report Forms that are submitted to IAATO at the end of each season. At the time of this paper’s submission to ATCM XXXIII, this data was not yet available. This information will be available soon in the Tourism Statistics section of the Tourism Overview page of the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).

1.4	Commercial Tour Vessels Operating in 2009-10
A full list of IAATO member-operated commercial tour vessels that completed cruises to the Antarctic, including information on their registry, permitting authority and passenger capacity is given in Appendix 1. In total, there were 26 vessels carrying between 13-199 passengers and four vessels carrying between 200-500 passengers, plus nine cruise-only vessels each carrying more than 500 passengers.

1.5	Commercial Yacht (Sailing and Motor) Activities
Based on Post Visit Reports from IAATO-member yacht operators, 180 passengers were reported to have traveled to the Antarctic Treaty Area aboard 12 commercially operated small yachts during the 2009-10 season. This information is also detailed in Appendix 1.

Visits and activities by yachts not operated by IAATO members are not included in these statistics. IAATO continues to make available its IAATO One-Off Private Expedition Yacht Package, which details IAATO and ATS guidelines, procedures and recommended best practices. One non-IAATO private yacht subscribed to this service for the 2009-10 season. IAATO remains concerned about tourists traveling on those non-IAATO operated yachts that appear to be unauthorized and whose crew does not follow the Environmental Protocol and its obligations. These concerns are further described in ATCM XXXIII IP075 Non-IAATO Tourism and Visitation in Antarctica.

1.6	IAATO Member-Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels & Yachts
All activities are approved through the Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documentation submitted in advance of the season, and are intended to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

1.6.1	Short Overnight Stays on the Peninsula
Seven IAATO members conducting traditional seaborne tourism to the Antarctic Peninsula offered short overnight stays in conjunction with the cruise. These short overnight stays provide an opportunity for tourists to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica, separate from being on the ship. Guides accompany each group ashore. This activity has taken place for more than 10 years in the Peninsula region.

When this activity takes place at sites where birds are breeding, tents are located at least 450 ft. (150 m) from nesting birds, including penguins, and located on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites, or organic debris might be covered. Each tent site is used for no more than a few nights per season. Toilets are taken ashore; human waste is returned to the ship and meals are eaten only on board the ship.

1.6.2	Climbing and Kayaking from Vessels in the Peninsula Area
Six IAATO members, including some yacht operators, offered climbing and/or kayaking activities to their passengers during the 2009-10 season. These activities have taken place for more than 10 years in the Peninsula region.




1.6.3	SCUBA Diving
Four IAATO members, including two yacht operators, conducted SCUBA diving activities to their passengers during the 2009-10 season. SCUBA diving has taken place in the Peninsula region for at least ten years.

1.6.4	Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
One IAATO member has utilized an ROV for more than eight years in the Antarctic Peninsula. The ROV is used for educational purposes, with video footage aired aboard ship for passengers to get a better understanding of undersea life.

1.6.5	Helicopter Operations
One IAATO member provided helicopter operations in conjunction with their cruises during the 2009-10 season. Helicopter operations for tourism purposes have taken place since the 1992-1993 season.

1.6.6	Hovercraft Operations
One IAATO member used a hovercraft in the Ross Sea area during the 2009-10 season.

1.7	Commercial Land-Based Tourism 
With the 2009-10 season, IAATO has one member and one associate member that operate land-based tourism activities: Adventure Network International / Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below), which conducted activities for the 24th consecutive season, and The Antarctic Company (referred to as TAC below), which operated in Antarctica for the fifth consecutive season and first as an IAATO associate member.
ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile and TAC operated out of Cape Town, South Africa.
Together, the two companies employ experienced staff and guides, 80%-90% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in Antarctica.

1.7.6	Government Activity Supported by ALE
ALE also supports National Antarctic Program (NAP) activities. Requests from National Operators, research institutes and government agencies resulted in ALE providing support for 53 National Antarctic Program (NAP) scientists and logistic staff and 36 NAP flight crew. 
Research groups, government representatives and their logistic support visited Patriot Hills and were accommodated at the camp for varying periods. ALE hosted visitors from British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Centro de Estudios Científicos, Chile (CECS), Ejército de Chile (Chilean Army), FACh (Chilean Airforce), National Science Foundation (USA), and Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide, Italy (PNRA).
One of ALE’s ski aircraft, Douglas DC3-TP67, was contracted to PNRA to fly staff between McMurdo (USA), Terra Nova Bay (Italy), Concordia (Italy, France) and Dumont d’Urville (France) stations as part of their seasonal deployment.
A group of scientists and support staff from NSF were accommodated at Patriot Hills camp and provided with logistic and flight support while working on POLENET (www.polenet.org).
ALE also provided flight and overland support for a continuation of glacier studies at Union Glacier by researchers from the Centro de Estudios Cientificos, Chile (CECS).
ALE supported the exchange of personnel and transported two tons of cargo to Belgrano-II Station for the Ministerio de Defensa, Argentina.
Fuel caches were placed for research projects that will commence in the 2010-11 season, and as part of the build up to the Lake Ellsworth Drilling project (www.geos.ed.ac.uk/research/ellsworth). 

1.8	Air / Land-Based Activities conducted by IAATO Members in the Antarctic Peninsula1
For the 2009-10 season, IAATO associate member Destination Management Chile (DMC), operating through Aerovias DAP, conducted seven separate day-trips and one overnight trip from Punta Arenas, Chile to King George Island. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers calling at Punta Arenas. A total of 285 passengers were escorted on visits to Frei Base and Zodiac rides to Ardley Island. Seven of these passengers participated in the overnight trip, with accommodations at Frei Base. Eight other planned trips were cancelled due to inclement weather or the effects of the earthquake that struck Chile.


1.9	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members
For the 2009-10 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO members.

2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2010-11 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2010-11 season. According to estimates provided to IAATO by members, 18,885 seaborne and yacht (sailing and motor) passengers are expected to land in Antarctica from commercially organized vessels, 558 from combination air-cruise programs, and 375 on air/land-based expeditions during the 2010-11 season. Another 14,350 are anticipated on cruise-only programs. No over-flights by passengers aboard IAATO-member aircraft are expected during the 2010-11 season.
Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B, Naiad, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV.

3.0 Projected Tourism Trends through the 2012-13 Antarctic Season
As noted in the introduction of this paper, recent actions taken at the IMO to ban the use and carriage of heavy fuel oil will affect Antarctic tourism in the next few years. This, along with recent interviews with IAATO members, makes it possible to look beyond the upcoming 2010-11 Antarctic season and forecast tourism trends through the 2012-13 season. 

The ban will significantly affect the operation of large cruise-only ships (500+ passengers) that transit around the tip of South America and briefly visit Antarctic waters. In addition to the financial implications, the ban on the carriage of these fuels will make these voyages very difficult logistically, as banned fuels must be completely utilized, or discharged to shore or to barges in areas where virtually no fuel-transfer capabilities exist, in order to meet the requirements of the ban. 

IAATO expects that a percentage of large cruise-only vessel operators and some mid-size vessel (201-500 passengers) operators will leave the Antarctic tourism market because of these logistical factors, once the amendment comes into effect August 1, 2011. It should be noted that factors other than the fuel oil ban have been responsible for some of these mid-size vessels leaving the market following the 2008-09 Antarctic season. These expectations, based on recent interviews with IAATO cruise-only and mid-size vessel operators, are shown in Tables 5 and 6 below.

It is not expected that the fuel ban will have a significant impact on small expedition vessels carrying fewer than 200 passengers (traditional tourism with landings), that carry and use lighter distillate fuels such as marine gas oil (MGO) or marine diesel oil (MDO), both of which continue to be permitted under the new requirements.

Extrapolating overall passenger statistics for future years based on the above projection of ships and voyages in Tables 5 and 6, overall Antarctic tourism numbers for the 2011-12 season are expected to drop 15%-20% from the 2009-10 season, as shown in Table 7 below:

Predicting the number of tourism vessels, including cruise-only and mid-size ships, beyond the 2012-13 season is more difficult. However, it can be expected that demand on the part of consumers to visit Antarctica will continue, and that growth could resume in 2012-13 and the years following, should economic conditions be favorable for tourism. 

As new cruise ships are brought into the Antarctic tourism market, the fuel ban – as well as IMO low sulfur emission requirements that call for the use of lighter distillate fuels – and other regulatory guidelines will be important considerations. Improvements in logistics and operational planning in managing fuel use are also expected to play a role in the predicted resumption of growth in the cruise-only and mid-size vessel segments of the market.

4.0 Historic Antarctic Tourism Trends 
A trends chart showing the change in cruise-borne tourism (with landed passengers), dating from the 1992-1993 season and including estimates for the 2010-11 season, can be found in Appendix 2 of this paper. Appendix 4 shows a decade of Antarctic tourism trends, from 2003-04 to 2012-13.
