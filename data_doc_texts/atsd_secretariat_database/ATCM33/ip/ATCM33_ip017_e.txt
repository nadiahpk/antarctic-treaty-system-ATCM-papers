1st India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum Seminar on Antarctica: exchange amongst Antarctic programs
Formally established on June 6, 2003, through the "Brasilia Declaration", the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA) represents a major initiative of policy coordination aiming at strengthening multilateralism, reinvigorating south-south cooperation and fostering democratization of decision making within major international instances.
India, Brazil and South Africa have developed, since the 1990's, a very active international profile on the grounds of shared attributes: large intermediate countries, consolidated democracies with ‘booming’ economies and with a strong influence in their own regions and interested in becoming active global actors; at the same time and due to large domestic inequalities, the three countries face common development challenges.  
Stimulated by these commonalities, India, Brazil and South Africa have manifested convergent interests on the nature and scope of a renewed international order. Being the most practical tool of IBSA, the Working Groups have as their objective to promote concrete ways of cooperation in the terms established by the superior structure.
In 2008, the Working Group on Science and Technology has agreed that representatives from Antarctica research from the three countries should strive to meet on the margins of international multilateral Antarctica meetings in order to coordinate their priorities and set up a framework for collaboration.
It was in this context that the 1st India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum Seminar on Antarctica was organized. The IBSA representatives gathered in Brazil, in August 2009, with the aim to increase their understanding of Antarctica. And in so doing, promote scientific research in IBSA countries to benefit their citizens and accelerate the development of their regions. 
The official and scientific representatives of the respective national Antarctic Programs encouraged and enhanced the exchange of scientists in the respective IBSA countries’ National Antarctic Programmes and reinforced the importance of joining efforts with the IBSA-OCEAN forum specifically with regard to its interface within their Southern Ocean component.
The nationals recommended the following platforms, which are seen as areas that could provide IBSA with strategic advantages in terms of cutting edge research. 
 
Platforms:
[A] Continental Antarctica
[B] Marine Antarctica - IBSA-OCEAN
[C] Atmospheric Antarctica 
[D] Cryo-sphere
[E] Space 
•	Geo-space
•	Astronomy
[F] Biotechnology 
[G] Technology
[H] Human dimensions 

Crosscutting themes
•	Geo-tracers
•	Understanding of the connection of South Africa, India and Brazil with Antarctica
•	Environmental monitoring (long term observations to understand variability and change)
•	Observing Systems (Southern Ocean, Meteorological)
•	Earth Systems’ Modeling 
•	Data dissemination policy in terms of the ATS
•	Building capacities

The representatives agreed on a five year time frame for a first phase. As a result, the Antarctic Research was included in a call for project proposals raised simultaneously in all three countries. Results of this initiative are still being expected.
