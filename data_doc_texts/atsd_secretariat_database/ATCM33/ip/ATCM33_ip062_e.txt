Report on IAATO Member use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines1
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 

Introduction
Due to the timing of ATCM XXXII, IAATO was unable to submit information on IAATO Member landing site and site guideline use for the 2008-09 season. During ATCM XXXII, IAATO did note that it would provide this information during ATCM XXXIII. This information is presented here. For similar timing reasons, IAATO will provide the information for the 2009-10 season at ATCM XXXIV. 
IAATO’s Updated Revision (September 15, 2009) Overview of Tourism 2008-2009 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2009-2010 Antarctic Season, which can be found on the IAATO website under Publications and Papers (see http://www.iaato.org/info.html), details Antarctic-wide levels of reported visitor activity of all IAATO members for the 2008-2009 season. 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional ship-based tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, representing over ninety-five percent (95%) of landed activity. The data in this information paper targets this sector of IAATO member activity. As all traditional ship-based tourism to the Peninsula during the 2008-09 season was conducted by IAATO member operators, it is believed that this information is reflective of actual levels of this activity. 
Antarctic Peninsula Landing Site General Activity
Preliminary analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates how the decrease in activity which is reported in IAATO’s Updated Revision (September 15, 2009) Overview of Tourism 2008-2009 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2009-2010 Antarctic Season has manifested itself in terms of variations in number of ships, voyages, passengers and landings during the 2008-09 season among traditional ship-borne tourism to the Antarctic Peninsula (see Figure 1). 
The decrease in all activity during the 2008-09 season is believed to be a consequence of the global economic downturn. This is borne out by the comparative decreases which took place across the board from the 2007-08 season. Notably, the most substantial decrease was in the number of passengers, down eighteen percent (18%) from 2007-08, while the number of vessels decreased by nine percent (9%), due to a combination of vessels being retired and companies pulling out of the market. Comparitively, there was only a minor level of decrease that took place in the number of voyages, down three percent (3%); landings made, down two percent (2%); and sites used, down one percent (1%).



Specific Landing Site Use

Table 1 illustrates the 20 most-visited sites during the 2008-09 season, in terms of landings made, in the Antarctic. This represents nearly seventy percent (70%) of the total number of landings made and indicates that the tendency for landings to concentrate at a few popular sites continues.

All but two of these most-visited sites – Damoy Point/ Dorian Bay and Danco Island – are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Site Guidelines or through National Program management through their proximity to stations. While visits by IAATO member operators to these sites follow standard codes of conduct for visits to Antarctic landing sites, IAATO is pleased to note that Site Guidelines for both Damoy Point / Dorian Bay and Danco Island are being tabled at ATCM XXXIII/CEP XIII (ATCM XXXIII WP39 and WP56).
Figure 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula. The full season extended over 173 days, from the first departure of an ice breaker for an early voyage to visit an Emperor Penguin colony on 9 October, to the last vessel leaving the area on April 4. The main season ran for 140 days, from the beginning of November through to mid-March. On the basis of the full season dates, no site received an average of one visit per day and on the basis of the main season only two sites received an average of more than one visit per day (Goudier Island with an average of 1.16 visits per day and Whalers Bay with 1.02 visits per day).


Additional tourism statistics are posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).


Use of ATCM Endorsed Site Guidelines 

An assessment of the use of the 14 sites covered by the ATCM Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms. 

The total number of known landings made at sites covered by the ATCM Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met, is shown in Table 2.

Co-ordination among field staff remains very effective. However, analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms noted that on one occasion during the 2008-09 season, the number of visits per day exceeded the limits set by the guidelines. When followed up with the operator and expedition leader involved, the mistake was acknowledged as an unintended oversight. 

Field staff continue to raise the issue of seasonal appropriateness on the limitations of the site guidelines. For example, once the breeding birds have left a site towards the end of the season, it would seem unnecessary to maintain visitation limits.

During two instances IAATO field staff reported non-IAATO visitation taking place simultaneously to their visit at sites covered by Site Guidelines.  In both cases the Guidelines were not followed by the non-IAATO visitation. 
Wider Policy Issues
In ATCM XXXI IP 82 Update on the Antarctic Peninsula Landing Site Use and Site Guidelines, IAATO identified four issues which should be addressed to ensure the continued success of the ATCM Site Guidelines:
    • An efficient systematic review process needs to be developed for the ATCM Site Guidelines already established. To this end, IAATO would recommend that the CEP and ATCM may wish to consider developing a review process in conjunction with IAATO; 
    • Awareness of the seasonal applicability of Site Guidelines, noting that there may be certain sites where the restrictions are no longer valid once the breeding season is completed; 
    • Assurance that all tourist activities are included in a single detailed tourism database. On this basis, IAATO would recommend that the ATCM may wish to consider encouraging all authorized tourist activities to submit Post Visit Reports Forms (on the standard excel form) to IAATO for inclusion in the IAATO tourism database. This will enable IAATO to continue to provide the ATCM with the most complete picture of tourist-related and non-governmental activities at all sites each season, in particular those which have limits applied. 
    • A mechanism should be considered to coordinate landings of non-IAATO operators to ensure the Site Guideline requirements are met where appropriate.
IAATO is pleased that through the work of the CEP Tourism Study, consideration is being given on how to make progress on some of these issues.
