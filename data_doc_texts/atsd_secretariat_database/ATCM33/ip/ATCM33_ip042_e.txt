Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment





Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment 

CEP Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

The introduction of invasive species is one of the greatest threats to Earth’s biodiversity, as they can reduce native biodiversity and alter ecosystem structure and function.  The majority of terrestrial ecosystems on Earth have already been impacted by invasive species, including many of the sub-Antarctic Islands but, although at risk, to date Antarctica has remained largely protected from impact by invasive species.  
Table 1 lists the non-native species known from the Antarctic terrestrial environment and provides details of their colonisation status and the areas over which they have spread.  From this information, the following conclusions can be drawn:
    1. All non-native species were found close to research stations or field huts.  
    2. Species from a range of biological groups are capable of colonising Antarctica
    3. The flightless midge Eretmoptera murphyi and grass Poa annua are both expanding their distribution and may present a greater threat to Antarctic terrestrial biota than the other non-native species.
A better understanding of current distribution, colonisation status, and ecological impacts of all known non-native species may help inform future management decisions (i.e. eradication or control/containment measures).  
The impact of non-native species on the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem may be increased greatly if they are dispersed to other Antarctic locations, by either natural or human-mediated processes.  Little can be done to prevent natural dispersal processes; however, biosecurity measures may reduce the risk of further human-mediated dispersal of known non-native species to other Antarctic locations and should be a priority within CEP (see ATCM XXXIII/CEP XIII WP 09 Open-ended Intersessional Contact Group on “Non-Native Species” (NNS) - 2009-2010 Report).

Eretmoptera murphyi
Signy Research Station, South Orkney Islands, Scotia Arc
1967, 1968 (?)
Expanding
~35,000 m2

Present in high numbers (mean 21,000 larvae m-2) within an area of c. 35,000 m2. Favoured habitat is dead moss and peat.
Hughes and Worland (2010)
Christensenidrilus blocki
Signy Research Station, South Orkney Islands
1967, 1968 (?)
Persistent
< 150 m2
Present in low numbers around the original introduction site.
Hughes and Worland (2010)
Poa annua
Arctowski Station, King George Island, South Shetland Islands
1985/86
Expanding
Has spread over 500 m into the vicinity of the nearby Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay. Expansion may be attributed to regional warming
1985/86: first found in metal grating at Arctowski Station main building 1990: spread to greenhouse area and above subterranean hot water pipes within a single area of c. 0.4 km2 1991/92: found in a number of locations with disturbed ground 2005/6: found growing amongst indigenous plant communities for the first time.                                          P. annua invasive on four sub-Antarctic islands

Poa pratensis
Primavera Station, Cierva Point, Palmer Archipelago, Antarctic Peninsula
1954/55
Persistent (?)
Limited to an area  c. 40 cm across, possibly because the micro-climatic is unsuitable for growth outside this restricted area.  
Transplant experiments of Nothofagus antarctica and Northofagus pumilo in soil imported from Ushuaia (Terra del Fuego). P. pratensis invasive on three sub-Antarctic islands.

1993 (?)
Eradicated
Single plant
