Bird populations on Deception Island

1- Breeding species on Deception Island

The most recent data refer to nine species of breeding birds on Deception Island (Ibañez & Monge, 2003): the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), cape petrel (Daption capense), Wilson’s storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), Antarctic cormorant (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis), greater sheathbill (Chionis alba), sub-Antarctic skua (Catharacta antarctica), South Polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata). The habitual presence, in greater or lesser quantities, of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) has also been recorded. Other species may be present on a sporadic basis or in very low numbers. 

Information on the size of breeding species populations is highly fragmented, even in the case of penguins. In some cases, censuses have been conducted late in the season (February to April) (Bo & Copello,  2000), which means that the resulting counts are clearly underestimated, as some nests fail by that time, while other pairs have already completed breeding. In other cases, censuses have been restricted to the bay’s interior, with vessels employed in the process (Kendall et al., 2003), which may also lead to an underestimation of the data. 

If one takes the data of Ibañez & Monge (2003) as a reference, population estimates show that there are at least 2110 breeding pairs of cape petrel (1500 in the area of Neptunes Bellows, 70 at Macaroni Point, 500 at Baily Head and 40 at New Rock), 500 pairs of Wilson’s storm petrel distributed throughout the island, 15 pairs of Antarctic cormorant at Neptunes Bellows, 40 to 60 pairs of greater sheathbill (20 at Baily Head, 12 at Macaroni Point, 3 at Neptunes Bellows, 1 in the area of Whalers Bay and 3 at Pendulum Cove), 30 pairs of sub-Antarctic skua distributed throughout the island, 5 pairs of South Polar skua, 174 pairs of kelp gull (60 in the area of the playa de la lobera, 30 on the NE slope of Mount Kirkwood, 4 in the area of Whalers Bay and 80 at Baily Head) and 147 pairs of Antarctic tern (50 at Whalers Bay, 20 at Telefon Bay, 70 at Punta Castilla and 7 in the area of Fumarole Bay). 

2- Chinstrap penguin censuses 

Chinstrap penguins merit being dealt with separately, as they are by far the most prevalent species on the island. Eight penguin rookeries were already described by Leppard & Kennedy (1954; cited in Downie, 2002), all located on the island’s exterior: Macaroni Point, West Macaroni Point, Baily Head, Entrance Point, South Entrance Point, South Point, Punta de la Atrevida and Punta Descubierta. The current population of chinstrap penguins on the island is unknown, as no censuses of the entire island have been conducted since 1987 (Shuford & Spear, 1987), when the maximum total number of pairs was estimated at 191,000.  

Partial censuses have been conducted of the rookery (14 colonies) at Punta Descubierta (Vapour Col), where counts were made from 1991 to 2008 (Barbosa, data not published), and of the rookery at Baily Head (4 colonies) from 1992 to 2002 (Naveen, 2003). 

The results from Punta Descubierta show a decrease of approx. 38% in the population, using the 1991 data as a reference (Barbosa, data not published). If one considers that the original estimate of the number of breeding pairs at this rookery was of some 20,000 (Moreno et al., 1994; Barbosa et al., 1997), this means that the population currently stands at roughly 12,000 breeding pairs. 

In the case of the penguin rookery at Baily Head, the largest on the island with a population of 90,000 breeding pairs according to data from Korte (1996), the census data collected from 1992 to 2002 (Naveen, 2003) indicates an average increase of 17%, although it should be noted that the colonies included in the census represented less than 10% of the total number of existing colonies. During the same period of time, there was a decrease of 21% at Punta Descubierta. This might be interpreted to mean that there was a movement of populations toward the Baily Head area. 

3- The penguin rookery at Baily Head

The penguin rookery at Baily Head is the only one on Deception Island that receives frequent visits from tourists. Data from 2003 indicate that the rookery received a total of 19,691 visitors from 1989 to 2003. Given the special characteristics of this penguin rookery, where penguins have to access the beach through a 50-meter-wide corridor, and its large population, one must consider the possible impact of such a large number of visitors on the penguins’ sea entry and exit dynamics, the possible consequences this could have on chick feeding practices, and the resulting risk of chick malnutrition and death.  

Over the past 19 years, a number of studies have been carried out examining the reproduction of chinstrap penguins on the island. Generally speaking, one can establish the average hatching date at December 22 and the average reproductive success at 1.67 chicks per nest (de León, 2000). Without being exhaustive, the results to date have determined this species’ reproductive strategies as regards breeding dates (Moreno et al., 1994;1997), the effects of nest building and position on reproductive success (Barbosa et al., 1997), behavioural strategies for nest defence (Viñuela et al., 1995), the effect of egg size on chick size (Belliure et al., 1999), the effect of chick size on survival (Moreno et al., 1999a), and predation avoidance strategies (Martin et al., 2006). 

There have also been studies of the link between the quality of individuals and their state of health (Moreno et al., 1999b), and more recently there have been studies of the presence of parasites and pathogens, immune response and the possible effect on populations (Barbosa et al., 2007a; Palacios et al., 2010), as well as studies of the levels of pollutants (heavy metals) in the population (Jerez et al., 2008) and of stress (Barbosa et al., 2007b).
