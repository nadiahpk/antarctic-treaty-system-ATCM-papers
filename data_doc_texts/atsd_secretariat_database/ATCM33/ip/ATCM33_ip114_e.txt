Report of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC)
    1. Introduction
ASOC is pleased to be in the Oriental Republic of Uruguay for this annual Antarctic Treaty meeting. This report briefly describes ASOC’s work over the past year, and outlines some key issues for this ATCM, further discussed in our Information Papers. 
The precedent of holding a meeting of experts on climate change, in Norway in April, was welcome and important. ASOC participated actively, submitting four papers. We fully support the recommendations made by the ATME to this ATCM. 
The ATME on ship-borne tourism held in New Zealand last December also was an important event, at which ASOC participated actively. We have re-submitted for this ATCM some of our papers presented there because they are relevant to the CEP and Tourism Working Group.
    2. ASOC Worldwide
ASOC maintains its Secretariat office in Washington DC, USA. Our website (http://www.asoc.org) provides details about the organisation, including its governance, staff and associated experts, finances and history. It contains a document and photo archive, a blog, and other information about ASOC and its work.  
ASOC has 30 full member groups, with member offices in most signatory countries to the Antarctic Treaty. ASOC campaigns are coordinated by teams of scientists, lawyers and policy experts located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and USA.
    3. ASOC Intersessional Activities Since XXXII ATCM 
Since XXXII ATCM ASOC monitored all discussions in the ATCM and CEP Fora, and contributed actively to the discussions on biological prospecting, non-native species, revision of Recommendation XVIII-10, effects of tourism, and protected areas. 
In addition, ASOC attended:
    • 28th Meeting of CCAMLR in October-November 2009, introducing papers on Antarctic krill management, Marine Protected Areas, the Ross Sea, and impacts of climate change.
    • International Maritime Organization (IMO) meetings, including the 59th and 60th Marine Environment Protection Committee sessions, and the 53rd session of the Ship Design and Equipment sub-committee regarding a Polar Code for ships operating in polar waters.
    • Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Management of Ship-borne Tourism in Wellington, New Zealand, December 2009.
    • Annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Santiago in June 2009 and the March 2010 IWC Working Group meeting in Florida as an accredited observer.
    • Meeting of Parties to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels in Norway, May 2009, as an accredited observer, and its Advisory Committee in Argentina, April 2010 by WWF as an accredited observer. 
    • Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Climate Change held in Svolvær, Norway, April 2010. 
    4. Information Papers for XXXIII ATCM
ASOC has introduced 10 Information Papers, which suggest steps for the ATCM, CEP and CCAMLR that will help to better achieve effective protection of Antarctic ecosystems and wilderness values over the longer term. Several highlight the need for closer, more effective working relationships between the ATCM and CCAMLR and their respective CEP and SC-CAMLR, and between the Antarctic Treaty System and the IMO, ACAP and IWC. 
    • IP 68: Working Towards A Polar Vessel Code – This paper identifies critical issues related to Antarctic vessel operations. ASOC supports a mandatory, legally-binding instrument for all vessels operating in polar waters, which addresses both safety aspects and the full range of environmental impacts from vessels operating south of the Antarctic Polar Front. 
    • IP 70: Comparison of Three Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Shipping and Tourism – This paper compares the outcomes of the recent Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Ship-borne tourism (Wellington, 2009) with previous ATMEs on shipping (London, 2000) and tourism (Norway, 2004). Progress on regulation of shipping and tourism should continue at a more rapid pace, so that regulation has substantive effects on tourism developments and shipping standards.
    • IP73: Key Climate Change Actions in Antarctica: Emissions Reduction, Adaptation and Science – Activities related to climate change need to take place in three areas: 1) Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through use of energy efficiency and coordination of transport and logistics; 2) Implementation of climate adaptation strategies to reduce the vulnerability of climate-sensitive ecosystems; and 3) Continued timely dissemination of the findings of climate research in Antarctica to policy makers and the world population in general. 
    • IP 74: Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Under Extreme Conditions: Case Studies From Antarctica – This paper was recently published in the internationally peer-reviewed journal Renewable Energy and provides examples of energy efficiency and renewable energy systems in use at Antarctic research stations. Years of successful operation demonstrate that these can make a substantial contribution to reducing energy use. 
    • IP 77: The Case for Inclusion of the Ross Sea Continental Shelf and Slope in a Southern Ocean Network of Marine Reserves – ASOC proposes that the Ross Sea shelf and slope be protected as an MPA for a range of scientific and environmental reasons. It is the least affected large stretch of continental shelf remaining on Earth, a site of unique evolutionary significance, a region with exemplary benthic biodiversity and globally-significant populations of Adélie and emperor penguins, Antarctic petrels, Antarctic minke whales, Ross Sea killer whales and Weddell seals. It is projected to be the least affected large marine ecosystem in the face of global climate change, and thus an excellent climate reference zone and refugium. 
    • IP 79: Tourism and Land-based Facilities in Antarctica: Analysis of a Questionnaire Distributed to Antarctic Treaty Parties at XXXII ATCM – ASOC has continued updating information on land facilities used to support tourism in Antarctica, based on responses to a questionnaire distributed at XXXII ATCM. ASOC would appreciate the inputs of all Parties to the questionnaire attached to the paper.
    • IP 80: Making Tangible Progress on a Strategic Vision for Antarctic Tourism – This paper recommends that key legally binding instruments that are still not in force become effective as soon as possible; that Parties adopt binding regulations in implementing the general principles of Resolution 7, 2009, by means of Measures; review and improve how EIA is applied to tourism; and use protected area instruments proactively as strategic tourism management tools.  
    • IP 81: Coastal Hydrocarbon Pollution: A Case Study From Deception Island, Antarctica - This paper updates results of monitoring activities conducted by ASOC at Deception Island in 2001-2002 jointly with the Institute of Chemical Physics of Materials, Environment and Energy, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, as reported to the SCAR/IASC Open Science Conference, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, July 2008.  
    • IP 82: Antarctic Ship-borne Tourism and Inspections Under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection – This paper reviews official inspections of tourism cruise vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area between 1959 and 2009. Tourism is a major Antarctic activity and should be the focus of inspections to a greater degree than hitherto. Purpose-made checklists for tourism would be useful.   
    • IP 83: Rising to the challenge: Key steps to deliver a Comprehensive and Representative Marine Protected Areas Network in the Southern Ocean by 2012 – This elaborates on key outcomes required during 2010 to ensure that a representative network of marine protected areas and marine reserves is in place across the Southern Ocean by 2012, and the importance of close collaboration with CCAMLR by the ATCM and CEP in this endeavour.
In addition, ASOC has prepared a poster that explores the human footprint in Antarctica for display at XXXIII ATCM.
    5. Other Important Issues for XXXIII ATCM
    • ASOC urges Parties to increase their efforts in implementing the Environmental Protocol to high standards. This includes addressing strategic environmental issues such as establishment of new stations, protection of wilderness values, and research on the subglacial environment.
    • Bringing Annex VI on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies into force as rapidly as possible should be a high priority for all ATCPs.  ASOC urges all Parties to redouble their efforts over the next year to solve the remaining implementation problems, so that Annex VI can be ratified and come into force in 2011. 
    • Biological prospecting represents a further penetration of commercial interests into the Antarctic, and is currently unregulated. ASOC supports a framework for managing it, including much more transparent sharing of data and information by Parties. ASOC remains surprised by the limited responses to Recommendation 2 of Resolution 7 (2005), which requires Parties to provide information annually on the nature and extent of their biological prospecting activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area by their scientists and companies. 
Concluding Remarks
The Antarctic region is facing many new pressures from global climate change and a wide and expanding range of activities within the region. ASOC and its member groups around the world hope that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties will take concrete actions and make decisions in Punta del Este that will protect the Antarctic over the longer term.
