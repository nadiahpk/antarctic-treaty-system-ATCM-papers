Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area
(ASMA) Management Group report

Joint Information Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, the UK and the USA



1. Introduction

Deception Island was formally adopted as Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 4 by Measure 3 (2005).

Working Paper XXVIII ATCM/ WP 20 and Information Papers XII SATCM/IP8, XXIV ATCM/IP63, XXV ATCM/IP28 and XXVI ATCM/IP48 summarise the extensive consultation amongst those Parties with major interests in Deception Island, and the process that lead to its adoption as an ASMA.
Following the formal adoption of ASMA No. 4, XXIX ATCM/IP19 reported on the establishment of a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the plan, and on the success of the Deception Island management group in these years (2005/2010) to effectively resolve the previously reported conflicts between science and tourism. 
At XXX ATCM, IP 108, ATCM XXXI IP 126, ATCM XXXII IP 112 ASMA gave an overview of the activities undertaken on Deception Island during the 2006/09 austral summers, and informed the Meeting of the planned intersectional work that the Management Group were considering.  
Present Information Paper is a summary of the activities undertaken in Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), those of the Management Group and the planned work over the intersessional period 2009-2010, in order to fulfil the objectives and principles of ASMA No. 4 Management Plan. 
  
2.  Overview of Activities at Deception Island 2009/10

2.1 Science and Logistics

Spain
Gabriel de Castilla Spanish Antarctic Base was open from 2009, November 25 to 2010, February 25 finishing along present campaign an important upgrading process with following objectives:

-  Improve the habitability sector to a capacity of 24 researchers.
    • Increase the facilities and research spaces in the Base to fulfil the research requirements of Spanish Antarctic campaign in the Island.
    • To decrease the environmental impact including removable energies, changing old habitability buildings for new ones, with less energy requirements, and to improve the fuel safety storage capacity with two new auxiliary fuel depots and 
    • To perform an external inspection (AENOR) to check that the Base fulfil all environmental requirements. As a result of the environmental inspection the Base has received the ISO 14001 certificate. The certificate means a complete management system to prevent and operatively correct any environment incident in the Base and its surrounding. .

A successful program of science was undertaken in Gabriel de Castilla Antarctic Base, mainly focussing on geodesy, geophysics, biology, and ecology, including following research projects :

    • Sanitary state of mammals in Antarctica Peninsula Area. Human activities impact.
    • Mesoscale Physical and biological coupling in South Shetland Island surroundings.Distribution and interaction of phytoplacton and mesoplacton)
    • Interaction with parasites and inmunity answers of three different antarctic pinguins species . Effects of global climate change.
    • Climate change effects over the ecology of intertidal sediments bentonic macrofauna of Livingston and Deception Islands. South Shetland Antarctica
    • Climate change, intertidal bentonic invertebrates , temporal series , reproductive cycles)
    • Nature and development of continental margins and initial stages of oceanic gateways opening in the NE Antarctic Peninsula (Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage, Antarctica)
    • Biomolecules detection in a global study
    • Data maintenace, control and analyses  of TSP-IPY  and CALM – S (ANTPAS-IPY) Livingston and Deception islands. Antarctic campaign 2009/2010)
    • Time geodetic series in Antarctica)
    • (Sismo –Volcanic activity in Deception Island)
    • Geotermic time series in Antarctica SERTEMANT- FLUX 
 
United Kingdom

A UK field party visited Deception Island between 19-26 January 2010. The objectives of this visit were to:

    • Determine the colonisation status of two recently discovered vascular plant species near Whalers Bay and take appropriate management action (see IP **).
    • Undertake field work to facilitate the review the  Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 140 
    • Undertake biodiversity studies of Deception Island’s terrestrial invertebrates
    • Take soil sample around the Whalers Bay area for hydrocarbon and heavy metal pollution quantification 

All of these objectives were met, and the invaluable support provided by the Spanish Antarctic Programme at Gabriel de Castilla Base is gratefully acknowledged.

Chile

Since 2008-2009 Antarctic season, Chile has been developing a study on psycrophilic microorganisms in Deception Island, with the support of Gabriel de Castilla Base. In December 2009, three researchers worked for around a week in the area collecting samples. The last field season is programmed for the next year.

2.2 Tourist Activities

During the 2009-2010 season an estimated 192 visits to various landing sites on Deception Island were scheduled to take place by IAATO passenger ships.  Of these, 54 visits involved landings at more than one location on the island. 

These figures exclude yacht visits and non-IAATO vessels. 

3. Intersessional work of the Deception Island Management Group (2009-2010)

Chairmanship

The Deception Island Management Group, decided that the Chairmanship of the group will rotate every 2 years amongst the 6 member Parties. United Kingdom and Argentina has already completed its 2 years, and in the last meeting of the Group, in the margins of CEP XII (Baltimore, 2009), it was agreed that Spain would chair the group for the following two year period.  

Work plan
In ATCM XXXII the ASMA group presented the Information Paper 112 ‘Report of the Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management Group’.  IP112 report that ASMA Management plans for their inter-session work (2009-10) the following objectives: 

- Assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities in the Area, encourage co-operation between Antarctic Treaty Parties and other stakeholders, and manage potential or actual conflicts of interest between different activities, including science, logistics and tourism;
- Avoid unnecessary degradation following on, by human disturbance, to the unique natural values of the Area;
- Minimise the possibility of non-native species being introduced through human activities;
    • Prevent unnecessary disturbance, destruction or removal of historic buildings, structures and artefacts;
    • Safeguard those working in or near to, or visiting, the Area from the significant volcanic risk;
    • Provide an opportunity for visitors to experience this unique island, and promote awareness, through education, of its significance. 

Review of the ASMA
The Deception Island Management Plan is due for its five year review in accordance with Annex V of the Environmental Protocol. A process has been initiated, but it is has been concluded that more time is required to complete the review.

Following the group’s interssesional discussions, and to progress our knowledge about threats over present ASMA values knowledge, it seems to be necessary to ask active researchers in the island to report ASMA about actions to be considered to protect island natural, scientific, historic, educational, aesthetic and wilderness values.

However, the following steps have nevertheless already been taken during the last year with respect to the review of ASMA and ASPA Management Plan Provisions for Port Foster Marine Area

    • During the 2009-10 intersessional period, the Management Group continued its review of the ASMA and ASPA management plan provisions for the Port Foster marine area. Port Foster is one of the most unique and best-known marine areas in Antarctica, with high scientific importance for studies on marine flora and fauna and the effects of volcanic activity on marine environments. Deception Island also has one of the most complete current species estimates for any Antarctic marine area (Barnes et al., 2008), and is therefore an important location for monitoring the potential introduction of non-native marine species. 
    • The UK has undertaken an initial study to examine possible approaches for management and protection of the marine environment, such as revising the boundaries of the existing marine ASPA, and the implementation of zoned areas within the ASMA. The results of this study have been considered by the Management Group, and it was concluded that there is a need for improved measures to be implemented. 
    • The Group has considered possible options for extending the boundaries of ASPA No. 145 to include a greater variety of habitats, as well as areas of geomorphological interest and existing reference sites. 
    • Recognising the high level of ship traffic at Deception Island, the Group also considered alternative approaches to reduce the risk of accidents. Experiences from Svalbard provide a useful example of the type of management approaches which might be considered, such as guidance on communications between inbound and outbound vessels, consideration of visibility, sea state and current, and speed restrictions. 
On relation to nesting penguin area of Bailey Head, Spain report the group about recent studies performed in the island (Barbosa et al , 1997, 2010; Benayas, 2009, 2010) and the necessity to follow, with these and other studies, that could advise future protection actions. . 
The group agreed that further work is required to identify the most appropriate components for the revised ASMA and ASPA management plans, and the Management Group would welcome the input of the CEP on any additional issues to be considered. The Group plans to continue the Management Plan review during the 2010-11 intersessional period. 
3. Planned inte-sessional work of the Deception Island Management Group (2010-2011)

After five operational years ASMA needs a complex and deep revision, so the management group report ATCM that ASMA review needs to follow, at least, another intersessional year for any proposal. 

During next year the Management Group, will study measures required to protect the important natural values of Deception Island and Port Foster, and support the implementation of the Management Plan for the Deception Island ASMA No. 4. 

Consequently the group will maintain contacts with qualified scientist in Deception Island actives in the different topics of geophysics, geology, volcanology, ecology, biology... to review with updated scientific and technical advise the different chapters of Deception Island ASMA 

The Deception Island Management Group will also ask that those with field work or visits on site complete, per Resolution 4 (2008), the "Checklist for inspections of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas". as one basis for consideration of revisions to the management provisions
