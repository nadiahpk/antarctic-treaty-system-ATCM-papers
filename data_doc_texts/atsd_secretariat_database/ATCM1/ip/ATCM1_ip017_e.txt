SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE HONOR`BLE MR. WILLIAM J. SEBALD, LEADER OF
THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION, AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE MEETING.

10 July 1961

I would like to express first our thanks and appreciation to the
Prime Minister for his kind words of welcome. I should also like to offer
my congratulations to you, Senator Gorton, upon your unanimous election as
Chairman of this Meeting.

It is a source of considerable gratification to my Government that
this Meeting is taking place under the Antarctic Treaty which was signed at
Washington on December 1, 1959, and entered into force on June 23 of this
year.

As you all know, the Treaty was the result of many months of
preliminary negotiations prior to the convening of the Conference on
Antarctica on October 15, 1959. During these negotiations, as well as
during the Conference itself, it was necessary to take into account and to
reconcile differing viewpoints of the countries concerned, which represented
all of the six continents of the globe. The conclusion of the Treaty is a
most heartening example of the fact that in spite of the many difficult
problems, both large and small, confronting the nations of the worlds in
those times, it is still possible with patience and good will for nations to
agree on matters of benefit to all mankind.

The United States has had a deep and abiding interest in the vast
forbidding reaches of Antarctica since the last decades of the eighteenth
century when the early navigators braved the South Seas in quest of new herds
of seals and whales. Later on, Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the United States
Navy, who sailed from Sydney in 1839, led an expedition along the coasts
lying south of the Indian Ocean and Australia, establishing that the area was
indeed a continent and collecting important scientific data. In the present
century, the flights of Lincoln Ellsworth and the four expeditions led by
Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd foreshadowed and inspired the large-scale
United States Antarctic research program which was initiated with the
International Geophysical Year.

During the International Geophysical Year the United States, in co-
operation with the nations represented here, established a program of intense
scientific exploration and studies on that continent which occupies such a
large portion of the earth's surface and about which we really know so
little.

The major efforts under the International Geophysical Year involved
studies in meteorology, ionospheric physics, aurora, geomagnetism, cosmic rays,
seismology, glaciology and geodesy. Since then the United States program has
been expanded to include also studies in biology, medical sciences,
oceanography, geology and cartography. This broader program reflects the fact
that this continent lies in a geographical location which makes it the only
possible laboratory where many of these studies can be undertaken. The United
States is fitting out a unique research vessel which will be ready within the
next six months to carry on programs in oceanography as well as in the other
sciences in the sea areas around Antarctica.

Data obtained at any Antarctic station gain immensely in scientific
value when studied in conjunction with similar data obtained from all the
other stations on that continent. For this reason we have made all data from
our Antarctic stations freely available and are happy that this shall be
continued under the terms of this unique Treaty. We also hope that the
program for the exchange of scientists under the Treaty may be expanded and
that arrangements can be made for scientists from the countries represented
here to join us at our stations and on our ships.

One of the principal aspects of basic scientific research is that one can never predict the ultimate value of information obtained. A vigorous scientific program must therefore be subject to continuing evaluation and change. For this reason we are prepared at all times to revise and modify our program of research to include new ideas that appear most useful and interesting.

The Antarctic program of the International Geophysical Year rested on co-operation among the participating countries. The Antarctic Treaty ensures the continuation of this co-operation by fostering scientific investigation throughout Antarctica, and by promoting international co-operation for this purpose among our countries. This scientific work is being carried out in the difficult natural circumstances of Antarctica, thanks to the patience and devotion of the members of the several expeditions there, and the spirit of co-operation that springs from a common purpose among scientists of our several countries.

Not only, however, does this Treaty provide for the continuation of co-operation in science; it realizes another great objective, that of preventing the use of a region as extensive as Antarctica for military purposes and ensuring that this continent will continue to remain an area where only peaceful activities are pursued.

The provisions of the Treaty are complemented by a system of inspection designed to promote the Treaty's objectives and ensure the observance of its provisions. We expect that the exercise of the rights of inspection established by the Treaty will be a normal activity under the Treaty. We (too) would not regard the exercise of these rights as necessarily indicating that there is suspicion of activities contrary to the Treaty. Indeed, the practice of inspection is the best way of assuring the absence of suspicion. The inspection system is a useful and practical feature which will contribute to the effectiveness of the Treaty and the realization of its basic objectives, which are peace and co-operation

Another significant provision is the system of continuing consultation among the Governments of countries actively engaged in Antarctica by such Meetings as the one for which we are gathered here.

As the First Consultative Meeting to be held under the provisions of 
the Antarctic Treaty, this Meeting in a real sense represents the entry into 
operation of the Treaty, as well as the beginning of a new era in the history 
of Antarctica, which the United States is confident will be marked by peaceful 
and co-operative relationships in that vast continent.

Mr. Chairman, the United States Delegation is indeed happy to be able 
to participate in this historic event. We are looking forward to a constructive 
and successful Meeting.
