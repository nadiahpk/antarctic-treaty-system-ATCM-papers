PRESS COMMUNIQUE

The First Consultative Meeting of the signatory
Governments to the Antarctic Treaty was held in Canberra from 10 to
24 July 1961. The purpose of the Meeting was to formulate recommenda-
tions to Governments on measures in furtherance of the principles and
objectives of the Treaty.

A total of sixty-five delegates, alternates and advisers
represented the twelve signatory nations - Argentina, Australia, Belgium,
Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of South Africa,
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America.

The delegates met in the Chamber of the House of
Representatives of the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, Canberra,
under the Chairmanship of Senator the Honourable J. G. Gorton.

The Representatives emphasised the importance of the
preservation of the Treaty area for peaceful purposes only and recalled
that the signatories had agreed to a system of inspection by observers
to this end as well as a ban on nuclear explosions.

Delegates reached unanimous agreement on sixteen
recommendations which were presented to their individual Governments relating
to co-operation in various aspects of scientific investigation,
logistics, conservation of living resources in
the Treaty area and other recommendations are set out in full in the
final report of the Meeting.

The Meeting unanimously agreed to recommend to their Governments the acceptance of an offer by Argentina to hold the next Consultative Meeting in Buenos Aires on a date to be agreed upon by Governments.

The proceedings have been conducted in the same spirit of international harmony which inspired the signing of the Treaty in Washington, U.S.A. on 1 December, 1959. In the opinion of all participants, the Consultative Meeting has provided a good foundation for further co-operation among the parties to the Treaty in carrying out scientific investigation in Antarctica and in the use of that area for peaceful purposes only, as provided for under the Treaty.
