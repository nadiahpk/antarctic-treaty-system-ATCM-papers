SPEECH BY R. O. NORDLAND, LEADER OF THE NORWEGIAN
DELEGATIOF, AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE MEETING

10 July 1961

Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of the Norwegian Government I wish to thank the Australian
Government for having convened and organized this meeting. We feel that it
is very fitting that Canberra has been selected as the place for the first
meeting, in view of Australia's great contributions to, and achievements in,
Antarctica. Norway has always had a great interest in Antarctica. We have
been pioneers in its exploration. We have been interested in whaling and
Norway was, as a matter of fact, the first country to start pelagic
whaling.

My Government looks with great satisfaction on the fact that, under
the Antarctic Treaty, this vast continent has been put aside for peaceful
purposes only. We feel that this might be a great step towards
world peace, that examples from this Treaty might be embodied elsewhere, and
that the spirit of this Treaty might prevail in other spheres. The
Norwegian delegation has come to this meeting to discuss the matters on the
agenda in the spirit of this Treaty - that there shall be co-operation among the
nations, that we shall exchange the various scientific results, with the hope
that the well-being of the world will thereby be achieved. I wish to thank
you again for having convened this meeting and we look forward to the
discussion being very fruitful. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
