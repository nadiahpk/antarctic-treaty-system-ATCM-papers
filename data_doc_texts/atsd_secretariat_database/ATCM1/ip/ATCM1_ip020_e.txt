MESSAGE TO WINTERING PARTIES IN ANTARCTICA

The First Antarctic Consultative Meeting sends 
greetings from Canberra to all who are wintering in the Antarctic 
area. Your work still involves great persistance, courage and 
self sacrifico in the best tradition of Antarctio exploration.
We hope that the practical measures we are recommending unanimously 
to our Governments will help all expeditions and stations by 
confirming and extending co-operation in the peaceful Antarctic 
among the twelve nations here represented.
