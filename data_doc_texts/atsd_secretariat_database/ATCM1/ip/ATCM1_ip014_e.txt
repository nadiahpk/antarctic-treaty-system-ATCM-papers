SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY MR. H. H. WOODWARD, LEADER OF THE   
SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION, AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE   

MEETING           
10 July 1961       

Mr. Chairman, Your Excellencies and Delegates:     

I should like, on behalf of my delegation, to express our appreciation   
of the fact that you, Mr. Chairman, are in the chair at this meeting.  I am   
quite sure that, with your qualifications, you will give us the best possible   
guidance during our deliberations in the course of this Conference. I gather,   
Sir, that you have a further qualification which a great many of us do not have.   
You have actually visited Antarctica.     

I should like to join with other delegations in expressing our appreciation   
of the fact that this meeting is being held in Canberra.  The Australian record   
of exploration and scientific research is one of which every country should be   
proud, and it is only fitting that this First Meeting should be held in this city.   
My delegation also joins with other delegations in thanking the Australian   
Government for organising this meeting and for arranging the hospitality and   
all the facilities that go with it.     

I should like to pay one further tribute, and that is to the   
Representatives who attended the meetings of the Interim Group in Washington   
over the past eighteen months.  To their efforts this Meeting I am sure,   
owes a great deal, for they in fact prepared the groundwork.

South Africa is associated with Antarctica in a geographical as well as a scientific sense. Capetown is the last port of call, or has been the last port of call, for the expeditions of many lands in their voyages southwards ever since Captain Robert Falcon Scott embarked on his gallant but ill-fated journey to the South Pole. Since that time other Antarctic expeditions have called at Capetown and, during the International Geophysical Year, such visits were a frequent occurrence. At the present time we are happy to record that the South African National Antarctic Expedition is, in fact, on the Antarctic Continent, and we are fortunate indeed in being able to operate from a base established by Norway, whose notable contribution to Antarctic research began with the spectacular journey of Amundsen.

I do not propose to say much about the Treaty itself. As we all know, it is based on the principles of peace and co-operation. Science has a very good record of co-operation in the international field. During the last century the record of international co-operation in science, particularly in the earth sciences, is worthy of note. The International Geodetic Association in 1861, the International Meteorological Organization in 1878, the International Seismological Association in 1903, the two International Polar Years, 1882-1883 and 1932-1933, and, more recently, the International Geophysical Year organised under the auspices of the International Council of Scientific Unions all bear witness to the recognition by scientists of the will to work together.

Bearing this in mind, we must recognize that co-operation is also a responsibility. We have the responsibility of going forward with this work which has been done in the past. We must endeavour to make a real contribution to this Meeting in carrying out the principles which it lays down.

Mr. Chairman, my Delegation is confident that the free exchange of views around this table will prove of the greatest benefit not only to those represented here today, but to the world of science, as a whole. Thank you very much.
