SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY M. PHILIPPE MONOD, LEADER OF THE  
FRENCH DELEG: TION, AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE MEETING  
10 July 1961                                    

Mr. Chairman,

In this troublad world of ours, public opinion is always alive 
to differencos among nations, and it is often more given to fe:r than to 
rejoicing.

Perhaps it is not sufficiently realised that, if there is cause 
for alarm, there is also cause for hope. Is not the entry into force of 
the Antarctic Treaty proof that, despite the vicissitudes of its evolution, 
and perhaps even because of them, the modern world is capable of finding 
the way towards a better understanding among nations and governments, as 
a result of the progress in scientific research now at the disposal of 
the international community?

This, at any rate, is the significance for the French Government 
of the Meeting which opens today, and this is also the wish it expresses 
for the outcome of the work of the Meeting. The achievement of the aims 
set forth in the preamble to the Treaty depends on the will of the Con-
tracting Parties. In regard to certain items, rapid progress can be 
achieved now, and it is on these specific items that this First 
Meeting should concentrate. The future is bound to depend on the initial 
impetus given, and hence it is important that this impetus should be, 
in every respect, in keeping with the common ideal so clearly set forth 
in the Treaty. The French Delegation will do its utmost to ensure that 
this is so.

(ORIGINAL: FRENCH)

Let us hone that we shall at once succeed in establishing a basis 
for friendly and fruitful co-operation in the scientific and technological 
fields. If, as I firmly believe, we can achieve this, we shall have 
served the cause, not only of human progress, but also of better inter-
national relations.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, I should like to congratulate you on your 
unanimous election and to say that nothing could be more fitting than the 
choice of Canberra for this first Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. 
At the same time, may I, on behalf of the French Government and its 
Delegation, thank the Australian Government for its generous hospitality.
