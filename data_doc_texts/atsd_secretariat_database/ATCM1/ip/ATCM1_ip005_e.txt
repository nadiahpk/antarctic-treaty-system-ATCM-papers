STATEMENT BY SENATOR THE HONOURABLE J. G. GORTON,
LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION

UPON HIS ELECTION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE MEETING.

I should like to express my gratitude to the proposer and
the seconder of the motion that I be appointed Chairman and to all the other
delegations here for the honour which they have done me.  I realize that I
have been appointed Chairman largely as leader of the Australian delegation
and because you are meeting in this country.  I now ask the Deputy Leader
of the Australian delegation, Mr. Harry, to take the seat of the Representative
of Australia.

Gentlemen, the Antarctic Treaty entered into force from 23rd
June, and this Meeting has been convened by the Australian Government pursuant
to the provisions contained in Article IX of the Treaty.  I take this
opportunity of recalling these provisions.  They are -

"Representatives of the Contracting Parties named in the
preamble to the present Treaty shall meet at the City of
Canberra within two months after the date of entry into
force of the Treaty, and thereafter at suitable intervals
and places, for the purpose of exchanging information,
consulting together on matters of common interest
pertaining to Antarctica, and formulating and considering,
and recommending to their Governments, measures in
furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty"...

MEETING UNCLASSIFIED
DOC./5
10 July 1961
(ORIGINAL IN ENGLISH)

It is in pursuing that resolution that this meeting is being held.

We have, in pursuance of that objective, extended invitations on 23rd June, for the Governments of Argentina, Belgium, Chile, the French Republic, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, to be represented at this the First Consultative Meeting in Canberra within the required period.

General agreement was reached that the Conference should be held between the dates of 10th and 24th July. We have made provision for plenary sessions to continue, if necessary, until the afternoon of 24th July. This seemed to be a reasonable requirement having regard to the number of items inscribed on the agenda. Nevertheless, we hope - and I as Chairman would hope - that possibly the business of the meeting might be concluded before that date.

I am now, Sir, entirely in the hands of this Meeting, but may I, as Chairman, suggest that the hours of plenary session be agreed upon by delegates. Our proposal is that meetings be held from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., with fifteen minute recesses at 11.15 in the morning and 3.45 in the afternoon, and that these meetings be held from Monday to Friday, except as might otherwise be decided. With the approval of this meeting, I propose that this inaugural public session should extend to 1 p.m. today, following which we shall resume in private at 2.30 p.m. to consider the business of this Consultative Meeting.

I now call upon the Honorable Representative of Argentina.

(The Chairman subsequently nominated Mr. W. G. A. Landale as Secretary of the Meeting and this nomination was confirmed by the Meeting.)
