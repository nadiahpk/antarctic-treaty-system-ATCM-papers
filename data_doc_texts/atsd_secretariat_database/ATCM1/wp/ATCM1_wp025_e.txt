PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION OF LIVING
RESOURCES

The Working Group has submitted the following draft:

The Representatives recomend to their Governments that:

    (i)    they recognise the urgent need for measures to conserve the
           living resources of the Treaty area and to protect them from
           uncontrolled destruction or interference by man;

   (ii)    they encourage the interchange of information and international
           co-operation with a view to promoting scientific studies of
           Antarctic life as the essential basis for long-term conservation
           measures;

  (iii)    they bring to the attention of all persons entering the area
           the need for the protection of living resources;

   (iv)    they consult on the form in which it would be most suitable
           to establish in due course internationally agreed measures
           for the preservation and conservation of the living resources
           of the Antarctic, taking into account the discussion at and
           documents submitted to the First Consultative Meeting;

    (v)    as an interim measure, and to the extent possible under national
           legislation and binding international conventions, they issue general
           rules of conduct on the lines of the attached statement extracted
           from the recomendations of SCAR as contained in the report of the
           Meeting held at Cambridge in August, 1960;

STATEMENT

GENERAL RULES OF CONDUCT FOR PRESERVATION AND
CONSERVATION OF LIVING RESOURCES IN ANTARCTICA

1.      Animals and plants indigenous to Antarctica shall not be
        unnecessarily disturbed and shall not be destroyed or
        injured. Exceptions shall be permitted on a strictly
        controlled scale which will not deplete the local stock
        and only for the following purposes:

        (a)     collections and studies for scientific purposes;

        (b)     food, (e.g. meat, eggs) for men and dogs;

        (c)     living specimens for zoological gardens;

        (d)     taking a strictly limited number of specimens,
                especially natural casualities, for private
                purposes.

        Exceptions (c) and (d) shall not apply for the time being
        to fur seals.

2.      Alien forms of flora and fauna should not be deliberately
        introduced except when rigidly controlled having regard to
        their chances of survival, capacity of reproduction and
        utilization by men.

3.      The following activities should be regulated with a view
        to preventing serious harm to wildlife:

        (a)     Allowing dogs to run free,

        (b)     Flying helicopters or other aircraft in a manner
                which would unnecessarily disturb bird and seal
                colonies, or landing near (e.g. within 200 yards)
                such colonies,

        (c)     Driving vehicles unnecessarily close to breeding
                colonies of birds and seals,
