AGENDA ITEM 9

RELATIONS WITH SCAR

Submitted by:  Argentina

Recognising the fact that the free interchange of information
and opinions among Scientists who are members of SCAR, and the recomendations
made by the said body on programmes and scientific co-ordination, constitute
a very valuable contribution to international scientific co-operation in the
Antarctic, the representatives gathered here recomend to their Governments
that:

Without detriment to their right to conclude among themselves any
agreements considered necessary for further the objective of
scientifc co-operation provided for in the Treaty, they encourage
and support SCAR in continuing the consultative work which it has
carried out so successfully, thereby facilitating to a large extent
international co-operation in scientific research.

PRESS COMMUNIQUE

The First Consultative Meeting of the signatory
Governments to the Antarctic Treaty was held in Canberra from 10 to
24 July 1961. The purpose of the Meeting was to formulate recommenda-
tions to Governments on measures in furtherance of the principles and
objectives of the Treaty.

A total of sixty-five delegates, alternates and advisers
represented the twelve signatory nations - Argentina, Australia, Belgium,
Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of South Africa,
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America.

The delegates met in the Chamber of the House of
Representatives of the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, Canberra,
under the Chairmanship of Senator the Honourable J. G. Gorton.

The Representatives emphasised the importance of the
preservation of the Treaty area for peaceful purposes only and recalled
that the signatories had agreed to a system of inspection by observers
to this end as well as a ban on nuclear explosions.

Delegates reached unanimous agreement on sixteen
recommendations to be presented to their individual Governments relating
to co-operation in various aspects of scientific investigation,
logistics, communications and the conservation of living resources in
the Treaty area. These recommendations are set out in full in the
final report accepted by the Meeting.

24 July 1961

(ORIGINAL IN ENGLISH)

The Meeting unanimously agreed to recommend to their
Governments the acceptance of an offer by Argentina to hold the next
Consultative Meeting in Buenos Aires on a date to be agreed upon by
Governments.

The proceedings have been conducted in the same spirit of
international harmony which inspired the signing of the Treaty in
Washington, U.S.A., on 1 December, 1959. In the opinion of all
participants, the Consultative Meeting has provided a good foundation
for further co-operation among the parties to the Treaty in carrying out
scientific investigation in Antarctica and in the use of that area for
peaceful purposes only, as provided for under the Treaty.
