AGENDA ITEM 13

PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION OF LIVING RESOURCES

Proposal by the Chilean Delegation

(1) Consider all land and water areas to which the Treaty applies,
including the permanent ice, the ice shelf and ice barriers, and also the
coastal waters south of 60 south latitude, as natural reserves subject
to protection.

(2) Issue permanent instructions to the personnel of their expeditions,
bases and stations in the Antarctic, to observe rigorously in the Treaty
Area the conservation measures recommended by SCAR, as specified in the
report of the meeting held by that body at Cambridge, England, in August
1960.

(3) Give orders to the Heads of their Antarctic bases, the commanders of
vessels and aircraft travelling south of 60 south latitude, and all other
persons vested with authority within that zone, to ensure strict compliance
with the instructions referred to in paragraph (2) of this Recommendation.

(4) Convene a Technical Meeting of expert representatives of the Contract-
ing Parties, at such place and date as may be agreed upon by the Governments,
but in any case before the next Consultative Meeting to be held in accord-
ance with Article IX of the Treaty, in order to draw up and present to that
Meeting a report which would include, inter alia:

DOC./P. 15 (CORRI)

13 July 1963

(ORIGINAL IN SPANISH)

(a) A comparative study of the national legislation of each of the Contracting Parties in respect of the protection and conservation of living resources.

(b) A draft Convention, based on such a comparative study and on the recommendations made by SCAR, which would make possible the unification of conservation measures in the Treaty Area.

(c) A technical opinion as to the species indigenous to Antarctica which are most vulnerable and call for special measures of protection to prevent their extinction.

(d) An indication of specific areas within the Treaty Area which should be declared wild life sanctuaries and within which no interference of any kind, not even such exceptions to the conservation measures recommended by SCAR as are allowed in the rest of Antarctica, would be permitted.
