AGENDA ITEM 10:

RELATIONS WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS HAVING A
SCIENTIFIC OR TECHNICAL INTEREST IN ANTARCTICA.

The followin: resolution, submitted by Australia and the
U.S.S.R. was adopted on 12th July, 1961:-

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that they
should individually encourage the work of international organisations
having a scientific or technical interest in Antarctica, including
the specialised agencies of the United Nations, and should promote on
a bilateral basis the establishment and development of co-operative
working relations with these organisations.

In this connection, the representatives take note of the
letter to the Minister of State for External Affairs of Australia
from the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organisation
dated 28th June, 1961, circulated at the Meeting. They welcome the
offer made by the World Meteorological Organisation of co-operation
in questions of meteorology and of the collection and relaying of
meteorological data in the Antarctic, and recommend to their
Governments that they should establish co-operation in these matters
through their representatives in that Organisation.
