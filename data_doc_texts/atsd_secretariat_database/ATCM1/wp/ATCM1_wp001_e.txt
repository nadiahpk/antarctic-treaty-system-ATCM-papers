AGENDA ITEM 12

MATTERS RELATING TO LOGISTIC SUPPORT

The following resolution, initially submitted by New
Zealand but subsequently amended, was adopted on the 13 July 1961:-

"The Representatives recomend to their Governments
that they should undertake to exchange information on
logistic problems. This might include information on the
design and construction of buildings and airstrips, the
provision of power supplies, the performance of aircraft,
ships, tractors and other vehicles, techniques of supply of
coastal and inland stations, the transport and handling of
cargo in Antarctic conditions, food and cold weather clothing.
They further recomend that consideration should be given to
the calling of a meeting or symposium of experts to consider
the question of the exchange of information on experience
gained in matters of the organisation of expeditions,
logistic support and transport, and that proposais for the
calling of such a meeting or symposium should be discussed
at or before the next Treaty Consultative Meeting."
