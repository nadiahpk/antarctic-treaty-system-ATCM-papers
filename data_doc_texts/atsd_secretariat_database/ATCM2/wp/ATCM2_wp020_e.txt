POINT 9 OF THE AGENDA

COMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION SUPPLIED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE VII,
PARAGRAPH 5 OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY, AND RECOMMENDATION
I-VI OF THE FIRST CONSULTATIVE MEETING.

Presented by Argentina

Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty refers to observers
and to the inspections they may carry out in Antarctica in furtherance
of objectives and to ensure the fulfilment of the provisions of
the Treaty.

To this end, paragraph 5 of the aforementioned article
VII requires the Contracting Parties to give previous advice of the
expeditions they intend to make, the stations they occupy, and the
personnel or military equipment they may introduce into Antarctica.

These provisions were subsequently the object of
recommendation I-VI approved at the First Antarctic Treaty Consul-
tative Meeting (Canberra, 1961) indicating the manner and time in
which this information should be given.

As it is very probable that during the pursuance of
the activities on the programme, these may or must, for various
reasons, be extended, restricted or modified, it is deemed highly
advisable to complement these regulations with the following project:

The representatives recommend to their respective
governments that as soon as possible and in any case before the
30th of June of each year and by diplomatic channels, they report
on the result of the activities, information of which was previously
supplied in accordance with Article VII, paragraph 5 of the Treaty,
and Recommendation I-VI of the First Consultative Meeting.

In cases in which expected activities and those already
notified have been extended, restricted or modified, further informa
tion regarding them must be given on this occasion.
