ITEM 6 OF THE AGENDA

MEASURES TO ENSURE THE EXCHANGE OF THE RESULTS
AND DATA OF SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS

CARRIED OUT IN ANTARCTICA

Presented by the Secretariat

The following draft recommendation is the result of a working
group debate held on July 19, in connection with the draft recom-
mendations presented by the United States (P. 12).

The representatives recommend to their Governments that, in
accordance with Article III of the Antarctic Treaty and with due
consideration of the recommendations of S.C.A.R. they take measures
contributing to:

1. The completion by July 1, 1963, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, of the transmission by scientific organizations,
to the recognized international data gathering centers, of
scientific observations carried out in antarctica from 1957
till 1959 inclusive, and 1960 if possible.

2. The free availability and exchange, by all appropriate means,
of scientific observations and results, in every scientific
discipline, made by expeditions in any part of antarctica,
as well as the prompt transmission (preferably within a year
of the receipt in each country of the date from antarctica)
of such observations and results to the recognized interna-
tional data gathering centers, where such centers exist.

3. The free availability of published results of Antarctic
research since the beginning of the International Geophysi-
cal Year and the transmission to the recognized international
data gathering centers, before July 1, 1963, of such publica-
tions as have already been issued and of subsequent publica-
tions within two months of their publication or as soon
thereafter as practicable.
