POINT 12 OF THE AGENDA

ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITIES FOR INCOMING AND OUTGOING
SAMPLES, SPECIMENS AND SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS

Presented by Argentina

Bases:

Article III of the Antarctic Treaty establishes the need
to proceed to the fullest possible extent to exchange scientific
observations and results, and recommendations I-I and I-III of
the First Consultative Meeting likewise bear this in mind.

In many cases, the exchange of information or scientific
research may require the despatch from one country to another
of biological or geological specimens, celluloid, phonemagnetic
or paper tapes recording date registered by automatic instruments;
whether to complete collections in the exchange of specimens, for
some specialist to analyze them or in order to be deposited in
the world data centres.

In particular cases, such as bacteriological samples collected
and preserved in conditions of sterility to prevent their deteriora-
tion, or collections of rocks to determine their paleomagnetic pro-
perties, or samples of water and air that are to undergo special
tests in certain laboratories, it is also necessary that the despatch
should conform to certain special requirements for handling and to
avoid delay.

In all countries, there are usually some restrictive regula-
tions, regarding the entry and outgoing of articles, and generally
speaking, the public employees in charge of their enforcement are
naturally unaware of the significance of these consignements for
scientific progress, and this may be particularly so in the case
of Antarctica. The exercise of their function also makes them
distrustful and specially when confronted with a strange or excep-
tional case. This may cause difficulties that impair the achieve-
ment of the lofty objectives pursued by the aforementioned speci-
fications of the Antarctic Treaty.

In other circumstances, it is necessary to despatch certain 
instruments for comparison and calibration with their respective 
"standards" or to transport some apparatus accompanying the re-
search workers who, in the exchange of personnel also recommended 
by article II of the Treaty and resolution I-II of the First Con-
sultative Meeting, have to travel from one zone to another of 
Antarctica, passing through other signatory nations of the Treaty 
to join their expeditions.

These instruments may be classified as: optical, photographic, 
radioelectric, etc., which are usually also subject to restriction 
by regulations, and which cause inconveniences or difficulties when 
enforced.

Recommendation:

The Representatives recommend to their Governments, in view 
of the specifications of articles II and III of the Antarctic Treaty 
and of the recommendations I-I and I-II of the First Consultative 
Meeting, and in order to contribute to the furtherance of its 
objectives:

a) that they provide special facilities for despatching and 
receiving samples and scientific specimens (biological, 
geological, geophysical, bacteriological), celluloid, paper 
or phonomagnetic tapes registering scientific data, and 
scientific cooperation, are despatched to, or proceed from, 
either separately or accompanied, another signatory nation 
of the Antarctic Treaty;

b) that they bear in mind the need of certain samples, specimens, 
tapes and instruments to be transported in order to meet certain 
special requirements and at times with the utmost dispatch, in 
order to fulfill the purpose for which they are being sent from 
one country to another.
