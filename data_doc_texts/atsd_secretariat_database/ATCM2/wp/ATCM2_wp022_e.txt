POINT 10 OF THE AGENDA

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION REGARDING LOGISTIC ACTIVITIES

Presented by Argentina

Bases:

At the First Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (Canberra,
1961), recommendation I-VII was approved recommending an exchange
of information on logistic problems and suggesting the convening
of a meeting or symposium of experts to consider the question of
the exchange of information on experience gained in matters of the
organisation of expeditions, logistic support and transport, and
also that proposals for such a meeting or symposium should be
discussed before or during the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting.

A symposium will be held in the coming month of August at
Boulder, Colorado, the United States. Organised by SCAR, it will
deal with logistics and the results may be most useful for purposes
of information. The same applies to the results of the 1962/63
Antarctic campaign.

It is considered appropriate to adopt now the measures
necessary for the implementation of recommendation I-VII, since
the technical information to be obtained from the aforementioned
symposium will be available in the near future. Consequently, the
following recommendation is proposed:

Recommendation:

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that in
view of the contents of Recommendation I-VII, adopted by the
Consultative Meeting of Canberra and which was intended to comply
with one of the aims of the Antarctic Treaty, that is, the creation
of conditions necessary for the carrying out of scientific research,
and in view of the proximity of the date of the holding of a
symposium on logistics organised by SCAR:

a) A meeting or symposium of experts be held in the second
semester of 1963 to review the present status of knowledge

on the organisation of expeditions, logistic support, and 
transport, for the purpose of appraising that knowledge;
and

b) That mutual consultations be held on the date and at the 
place considered most suitable for holding the symposium, 
as well as for purposes of organisation and the adoption 
of an agenda.
