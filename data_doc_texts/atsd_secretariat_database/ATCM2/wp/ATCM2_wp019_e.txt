ITEM 7 OF THE AGENDA

CONSERVATION OF WILD LIFE

Presented by the United Kingdom

Article IX 1 (f) of the Antarctic Treaty envisages the
discussion by Contracting Parties of measures regarding the
preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica.
Recommendation VIII of the Canberra Consultative Meeting proposed
certain interim measures and recommended to governments that "they
consult on the form in which it would be most suitable to establish
internationally agreed measures for the preservation and conserva-
tion of living resources of the Antarctic, taking into account the
discussion at and documents submitted to the first consultative
meeting". It was also recommended that this question should be
included in the Agenda for the next Consultative Meeting.

2. The United Kingdom Government believes that an International
Convention is the best method of dealing with this problem. They
accordingly submit a draft Convention for discussion and hope
that an agreed text can be formulated by representatives and
recommended for the consideration of governments.
