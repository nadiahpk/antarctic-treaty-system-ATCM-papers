MATTERS RELATING TO THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION

IN ANTARCTICA

Presented by the United Kingdom

Article I: (1) of the Antarctic Treaty includes among the
subjects specifically to be discussed at the consultative meetings
"questions relating to the exorcise of jurisdiction in Antarctica".
It is realised that this is a very complex subject and for that
reason the United Kingdom delegation at Canberra (as the leader of
the delegation, Sir William Oliver, explained) refrained from rais-
ing the substance of the issue at the first consultative meeting to
be held under Article IX of the Treaty. However, in the opinion of
Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom the matter is one
which ought now to be considered by the governments concerned. Although
there is in the Antarctic Treaty a provision which refers to
jurisdiction (Article VIII), it does so in terms which do not
really touch the heart of the problem. It is fortunate that so far
the absence of satisfactory measures relating to the exercise of
jurisdiction in Antarctica has not given rise to any serious dif-
ficulty, but with the ever increasing level of activity in the area
the problem is likely to arise in an acute practical form sooner
or later.  In the opinion of Her Majesty's Government it would be
better not to wait until this happens before beginning to consider
the complex issues involved. Furthermore the Antarctic Treaty it-
self clearly envisages that the terms of Article VIII are in some
respects in an interim nature (see Article VIIII (2)).

For these reasons Her Majesty's Government put forward the
attached Resolution which envisages the appointment of a Committee
of Experts to study the problem and to formulate measures relating
to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica.
