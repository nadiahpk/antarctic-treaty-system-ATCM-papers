POINT 17 OF THE AGENDA

OTHER MATTERS

Presented by the South-African Delegation

Having in mind the need of improved administrative arrange-
ments to maintain efficient contact between the Antarctic Treaty
Powers and other organisations and to assist them in carrying out
their commitments under the Antarctic Treaty, the South African
Delegation proposes the following as a basis of non-committal
discussion preparatory to a more concrete arrangement to be decided
upon at the next Consultative Meeting:

The formation of a working group consisting of the Diplomatic
Missions accredited in the capital of one of the Contracting Parties,
preferably in the Southern Hemisphere, to deal with the business of
the Treaty Powers.

The tasks of the working group will be:

(i) to make the administrative arrangements for the next Consult-
ative Meeting;

(ii) remind member governments of their commitments under the
Treaty;

(iii)co-ordinate and distribute papers amongst the member govern-
ments;

(iv) to deal with such other matters as may be entrusted to it by
member governments or Consultative Meetings.

The Working Group will remain in the capital mentioned above
for the duration of 2, 3 or such number of Consultative Meetings
as may be decided upon, having regard to the increased efficiency
provided by continuity of personnel dealing with Antarctic problems.

After this period the Working Group could by com:on consent
be established in another capital always bearing in mind that all
Treaty Powers should be diplomatically represented in such capital.

The Chairman of the Working Group will be the Representative
of the country responsible for convening the next Consultative
Meeting.

The Working Group will have facilities provided free of charge
by the host government, consisting of an official together with such
typing staff as may be necessary to carry out the administrative
requirements of the Working Group.

The above measures are designed to eliminate the possibility
of even the embryo of a permanent secretariat. It will provide an
"address" for the Treaty Powers and thus establish an efficient
communications channel for member governments inter se and with other
organisations.
