ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING

Presented by Australia

The representatives recommend to their Governments:

(i) that they should make arrangements for the expeditious
examination of recommendations adopted by Consultative
Meetings, and should undertake to act as promptly as
they reasonably can, subject to any practical or
constitutional requirements, in signifying their approval
of recommendations;

(ii) that if they find themselves unable to give early approval
to one or more of the recommendations of a Consultative
Meeting, they should signify their approval of the remain-
ing recommendations, whether separately or as a group,
as soon as they are able to do so;

(iii)that they should notify other Contracting Parties, after
three months have elapsed from the closing date of a
Consultative Meeting, of the stage which has been reached
in their consideration of any recommendations of that
meeting still awaiting approval.
