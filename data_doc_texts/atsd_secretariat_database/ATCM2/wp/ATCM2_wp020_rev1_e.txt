POINT 11 OF THE AGENDA

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE CARRYING OUT OF THE
PROPOSED ANTARCTIC ACTIVITIES

Presented by Argentina

Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty refers to observers
and to the inspections they may carry out in Antarctica in furtheran-
ce of objectives and to ensure the fulfilment of the provisions of
the Treaty.

To this end, paragreph 5 of the aforementioned article
VII requires the Contracting Parties to give previous advice of the
expeditions they intend to make, the stations they occupy, and the
personnel or military equipment they may introduce into Antarctica.

These provisions were subseqently the object of
recomendati=n I-VI approved at the First Antarctic Treaty Consultati-
ve Meeting (Canberra, 1961) indicating the manner and time in which
this information should be given.

As it is very probable that during the pursuance of
the activities on the programme, these may or must, for various
reasons, be extended, restricted or modified, it is deemed highly
advisable to complement these regulations with the following project:

The representatives recomend to their respective
governments that as soon as possible and in any case before the
30th of June of each year and by diplomatic channels, they report
on the result of the activities, information of which was previosly
supplied in accordance with Article VII, paragraph 5 of the Treaty,
and Recommendation I-VI of the First Consultative Meeting.

In cases in which expected activities and those alrea-
dy notified have been extended, restricted or modified, further in-
formation regarding them must be given on this occasion.
