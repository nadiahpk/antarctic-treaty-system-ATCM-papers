ITEM 9 OF THE AGENDA

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UNDER ARTICLE VII.5

Presented by Australia

Article VII.5 of the Antarctic Treaty requires each Contracting
Party to circulate certain particulars of their expeditions etc. "at
the time when the Treaty enters into force for it" and thereafter to
"give notice in advance." Recommendation VI of the Canberra Consult-
ative Meeting sets out these requirements in greater detail, and
further stipulates that this information shall be exchanged "as early
in each year as possible and in any case before the end of November
each year".

Eleven of the twelve original signatories participated in a
voluntary interim exchange of information before the Treaty entered
into force. Further particulars were supplied subsequent to the First
Consultative Meeting by the following Treaty members, (the dates shown
being the date of their transmission through diplomatic channels to
the Australian Government):

Australia                     -   1st December, 1961
United Kingdom               -   11th December, 1961
U.S.A.                       -   12th December, 1961
Argentina                    -   13th December, 1961 and
                                 23rd February, 1962
U.S.S.R.                     -   20th January, 1962
Japan                        -   5th February, 1962
New Zealand                  -   6th February, 1962
France                       -   16th February, 1962
South Africa                 -   22nd February, 1962
CONFIDENTIAL
- 2 -                 Memo Expl.3

The Australian Government has not received communications from Chile,
Norway and Belgium.

The Australian Government is disappointed that the information
circulated by Contracting Parties shculd not have been supplied in
advance of the departure of 1961/2 Antarctic expeditions and that in
many cases, it did not include full particulars set out in Recom-
mendation VI. Australia regards the exchange of information as an
important practical means of ensuring observance of the provisions
of the Antarctic Treaty and is anxious that the application of
Article VII should not become weakened as a result of the failure
of signatories to meet their obligation to supply prompt and
comprehensive particulars, in advance, of their Antartic activities.
It is hoped that returns for 1962, including "nil returns", will be
prepared and circulated with these objectives in mind.

CONFIDENTIAL
