Final Report :


Proposed text for Item 14


. The meeting was provided with a report of the activities of
WMO since the presentation of definitive data on the Antarctic
observation and telecommunication network at ATCM XIV. WMO has
carried out monitoring tests of the ability of the
observation/communication system to deliver timely and accurate
data for short periods in both 1987 and 1988 and these continue
to indicate considerable scope for improvements in technology
and detailed procedures. WMO further intends to hold a meeting
of telecommunication experts in December 1989 to define
problems and seek remedies.  The WMO working Group on Antarctic
Meteorology will hold to 4 yearly meeting in September 1990 and
will further consider these problems and the progression of the
WMO Long Term Plan for the World Weather Watch in Antarctica.


The full text of the WMO report to ATCM XV is reproduced at
Appendix...


8. The Meeting therefore agreed to:


. note the continuing efforts of WMO to improve the
availability of Antarctic meteorological data via improved
communication systems and practices;


. invite WMO to provide through its national Permanent
Representatives the report of the special meeting of experts on
Antarctic Telecommunications (to be held in December 1989) to
the appropriate operators of national Antarctic programmes;


. note the WMO intention to proceed with its Long Term Plan for
Antarctic meteorological services in the light of relevant
decisions of ATCM XV concerning Air Safety and Marine
Meteorological Services and related meetings which have been
held with SCAR and IOC;


. invite WMO to provide further information on these matters
following the 5th session of EC-WGAM to ATCM-XVI.


* Appendix should then consist of existing paragraphs 1 to 7 of
