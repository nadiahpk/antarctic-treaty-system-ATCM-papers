ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING IN ANTARCTICA
(Submitted by the Delegation of United States)
Draft Recommendation

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING IN ANTARCTICA

The Representatives,

Recognizing that, because of its relatively pristine state, Antarctica provides an important natural laboratory to obtain baseline information on Antarctic environments and for detecting and monitoring some of the effects of human activities on the global environments and ecosystems upon which the welfare and survival of the human species depend ;

Recognizing also that Scientific research, related logistic support activities, tourism, natural resources exploration and development, and other human activities in Antarctica could have local, regional or global environmental effects, or compromise the scientific value of Antarctica ;

Recalling the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) response to Recommendation XII-3 and Recommendation XIV-2, which call upon the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to establish programs for detecting and monitoring the effects of human activities on key components of Antarctic ecosystems ;

Conscious that determining cause-effect relationships between certain human activities and observed changes in Antarctic environments will require knowledge of natural variation in Antarctic environments and accurate records of such things as the types and quantities of fuels used to supply heat and light to Antarctic stations and to operate aircraft and land vehicles in Antarctica ;

Aware of the ecosystem monitoring program being developed to help meet the objectives of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Ressources ;

Desiring to identify and initiate cooperative, long-term monitoring programs necessary to verify the predicted effects and to detect and quantify the possible unforeseen effects of human activities on the Antarctic environment ; and

Recognizing that the design and implementation of integrated, comprehensive, and cost-effective environmental monitoring programs in Antarctica serve both scientific and environmental protection purposes,

Recommend to their Governments that :

1. They encourage their national Antarctic programs, individually and collectively, to continue and, as appropriate, expand programs in Antarctica aimed at detecting and monitoring global environmental change, including its effects on the ozone layer over Antarctica, effects on Antarctic terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric environments as well as effects on Antarctic living resources ;
2.  They undertake, individually and collectively, to 
establish environmental monitoring programs to verify the 
predicted effects and to detect the possible unforeseen effects 
on Antarctic environments and living resources of activities in 
the Antarctic Treaty area, including

- wastes disposal
- contamination by oil or other hazardous or toxic 
  substances ;
- construction and operation of stations, field camps, and 
  related ship, aircraft and other logistic support 
  facilities ;
- conduct of science programs ;
- recreational activities, and
- those affecting the purposes of designated protected 
  areas.

3. They take such steps as necessary to maintain accurate 
records of the activities of their national programs in 
Antarctica, including, among other things, maintaining accurate 
records of the types and quantities of fuels and other 
materials transported to and used to support their national 
programs in Antarctica, the types and quantities of materials 
subsequently removed from Antarctica, and the types and 
quantities of materials disposed of in Antarctica by various 
means, bearing in mind Recommendation XV- ;' and

4. They convene, in accordance with Recommandation IV-24, a 
meeting of experts to consider and provide advice on :

    a. The types of cooperative, long-term monitoring programs 
       that would be useful for detecting, quantifying, 
       monitoring, and determining the likely causes of 
       observed changes in air quality, snow and water 
       quality, and other key features of Antarctic environ-
       ments and living resources ;

    b. on the methods that should be used to collect, report, 
       store, exchange, and analyze needed data ; and

    c. on where and how frequently various environmental 
       parameters should be measured.

5. They exchange information and establish cooperative working 
relating with those Specialized Agencies of the United Nations 
and other international organizations having a scientific or 
technical interest in Antarctica that are engaged in the 
planning and implementation of related scientific research and 
environmental monitoring programs.
COMPARABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL DATA

The representatives,

Recalling :

i)     Recommendation XIII-5 inviting the Scientific Committee 
on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer scientific advice on how 
to improve the comparability and accessibility of scientific 
data ;

ii)    that   the Report of the XIVth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting identified two important initial steps to 
improve data comparability and accessibility,  those of 
determining types of useful data for management and assessment 
of the development of a directory ;

Noting :

i)     that the Report of XX SCAR responds to Recommendation 
XIII-5 by describing several steps needed for the establishment 
of  an  Antarctic data system  and  by  calling  for  the 
establishment  of a group of  specialists to  advise  on  the 
development of such a system ;

ii)    that the Report of XX SCAR identifies the development of 
national  directories of Antarctic data as  the  logical  first 
step in the development of a data system ;

Desiring to create an Antarctic scientific data system for use 
in facilitating environmental assessment and monitoring and the 
promotion of scientific research ;

Recommend to their Governments that :

1)     through their National Committees they encourage SCAR to 
establish a group of data specialists ;

2)     they  develop  and  make  available  to  SCAR  and  other 
Antarctic Treaty Parties a directory listing where and in what 
format Antarctic scientific data now exsists ; and

3)     they convene, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, a 
Meeting of Experts to consider how to establish an Antarctic 
scientific data system, including, inter alia

     a)  the creation of an Antarctic Scientific Data 
Directory ;

     b)  a program of work describing other next steps needed 
to created an Antarctic Scientific Data System ;
c) technologies useful in the creation of an Antarctic Scientific Data System ;
d) parameters which should be monitored in Antarctica
