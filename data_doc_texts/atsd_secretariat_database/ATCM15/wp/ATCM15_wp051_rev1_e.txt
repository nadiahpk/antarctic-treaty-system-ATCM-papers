SUGGESTED LANGUAGE FOR THE REPORT REGARDING ITEM 12 (a)

(Submitted by the delegation of the United States)
XV ATCM/WP/51

Suggested language for the report regarding Item 12 (a)

The United States delegation introduced a draft Recommendation recalling the actions of ATCM XIII and XIV and the Report of SCAR XX and calling for Parties to develop data directory listings, the compilation of an Antarctic Scientific Data Directory, as well as the identification of other future steps in the creation of an Antarctic Scientific Data System.

The draft was generally welcomed and several suggestions for changes were made. Several delegations suggested that government efforts be closely coordinated with those of SCAR and that a more detailed programme of work be included.

Based on informal discussions in a small group, the items were addressed by amending several paragraphs in the Recommendation.

These changes are intended to assure that consideration of how to create an Antarctic Scientific and Environmental Data System with SCAR occurs in close cooperation with government data management experts, so as to assure the production of a practical plan of action. Another mechanism to assure this outcome is the convening of a group of Experts meeting to consider the SCAR draft report.

Recommendations XV-___ was adopted.
COMPARABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF ANTARCTIC SCIENTIFIC DATA

The Representatives,

Recalling :

i)     Article III (1) (c) of the Antarctic Treaty calling on 
Parties to exchange and make freely available scientific 
observations and results from Antarctica;

ii)    Recommendation XIII-5 inviting the Scientific Committee on 
Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer scientific advice on how to 
improve the comparability and accessibility of Antarctic 
scientific data;

iii)   that the Report of the XIVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting identified two important initial steps to improve data 
comparability and accessibility, those of determining types of 
useful data for management and assessment and the development 
of a directory;

Noting :

i)     that the Report of XX SCAR responds to Recommendation 
XIII-5 by describing several steps needed for the establishment 
of an Antarctic data system and by calling for the 
establishment of a committee on data management to advise on 
the development of such a system;

ii)    that SCAR has established such a committee with the 
following terms of reference:

       a)  to determine the requirements within SCAR for a 
coordinated approach to data;

       b)  to consider the possible compilation of a SCAR 
directory of available items, data bases, geographical 
information systems, data centers, specimin holdings 
relevant archives and bibliographic collections;

       c)  to consider the formation of guidelines for common or 
minimum formats for data collection and archiving; and

       d)  to suggest areas for coordination with external 
activities or organisations.

iii)   that the Report of XX SCAR identifies the development of 
national directories of Antarctic data as the logical first 
step in the development of a data system;
Desiring : 

i)  to improve the accessibility and comparability of 
Antarctic scientific data to help give effect to Article III 
(1) (c) of the Antarctic Treaty; and

ii)  to create an Antarctic scientific data system for use in 
facilitating environmental assessment and monitoring and the 
promotion of scientific research;

Recommend to their Governments that :

1)  they develop and make available to SCAR and other 
Antarctic Treaty Parties a directory listing where and in what 
format Antarctic scientfic data now exist; and

2)  they agree, working in cooperation with the SCAR Committee 
to compile an Antarctic Scientific Data Directory;

3)  they agree to assist the SCAR Committee to develop a 
programme of work describing further steps needed to create an 
Antarctic Scientific and Environmental Data System, including 
consideration of relevant technologies; and

4)  upon completion of the draft programme of work developed 
by SCAR, in cooperation with relevant governmental experts, 
they convene, in accordance with Recommendations IV-24, a 
Meeting of Experts, with expertise in data management, to 
consider how to establish an Antarctic Scientific and 
Environmental Data System.
