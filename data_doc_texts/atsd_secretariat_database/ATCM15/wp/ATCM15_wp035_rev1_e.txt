DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON NEW SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC
INTEREST

(Working paper submitted by the delegation of the United
Kingdom)
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

XV ATCM : Facilitation of scientific research : Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest : Iterim guidelines : additional 
sites.

The Representatives,

Recalling, recommendations VIII-3 and VIII-4;

Noting that management plans have been prepared and approved by 
the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) for 
certain Sites of Special Scientific Interest additional to 
these already designated :

Considering that it would be advantageous to gather experience 
of the practical effect of the management plans prepared for 
these sites;

Recommend to their Governments that they voluntarily take 
account of the management plans, annexed to this 
Recommendation, for the following sites :

Site n° 29 : Ablation Point-Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island.

Site n° 30 : Avian Island, North-West/Marguerite Bay.

Site n° 31 : Mount Flora, Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula.
SSSI No  29

ABLATION POINT-GANYMEDE HEIGHTS, ALEXANDER ISLAND

1.  GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION

The Ablation Valley-Ganymede Heights massif and its valley systems
(70°49'S, 68°25'W) is situated on the mid-east coast of Alexander Island
overlooking the shelf ice of George VI Sound and about 120 km from open sea
to the north.

2.  MANAGEMENT PLAN

(i)  Description of site

The site extends from lat. 70°45'S to lat. 70°55'S and from long. 68°40'W
to the George VI Sound coastline.

The largely ice-free area comprises three main and two lesser valley
systems separated by often precipitous ridges and plateaux 650-760 m high.
The Site is bounded by Grotto Glacier to the north, Jupiter Glacier to the
south and west, and George VI Sound to the east. The area extends 18 km
from north to south and 10 km from east to west, rising to a maximum
altitude of 1070 m.

(ii) Reason for designation

The site represents one of the largest ablation areas in West Antarctica.
It has a complex geology, the main rock types being conglomerates, arkosic
sandstones and shales with subordinate pebbly mudstones and sedimentary
breccias. The base of the succession is formed of a spectacular melange,
including large blocks of lava and agglomerate. This crops out on the
valley floors and at the base of several cliffs. It possesses a wide range
of geomorphological features including raised beaches, moraine systems and
patterned ground. There are several permanently frozen freshwater lakes
and many ice-free ponds supporting a diverse flora (including aquatic
bryophytes) and fauna. There are a few major streams  and many smaller
ones in summer.  The vegetation is generally sparse, with a unique moss-
and liverwort-dominated community type being restricted to "oases" where
water issues from otherwise dry barren hillsides.  The terrestrial and
freshwater ecosystems are vulnerable to human impact and therefore merit
protection from the uncontrolled presence of Man.

(iii) Outline of research

Several detailed geological, geomorphological, glaciological and
limnological studies have been made by BAS scientists within the Site and
it is proposed to undertake terrestrial ecological research throughout the
area.

(iv) Date of expiry of designation

31 December 1999.

AVIAN ISLAND, NORTH-WEST MARGUERITE BAY

1.  GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION

Avian Island (67°46'S, 68°54'W) lies c. 1 km south of the south-west tip of
Adelaide Island in north-west Marguerite Bay.

2.  MANAGEMENT PLAN

(i)  Description of site

The Site consists of Avian Island together with its littoral zone.  It is
1.45 km long by 0.8 km at its widest, and rises to about 45 m altitude.  It
is largely ice-free in summer and there are several shallow melt pools, the
largest being on the eastern raised beach area. Excluded from the Site is
the north-western corner of the island where there is a small refuge hut;
this area is bounded by a line extending from the north-east end of the
southern of two long inlets at the north-west of the island, due north over
the western slope of a low rocky hill, to the north coast of the island.
All land to the west of this line is not included in the Site.

(ii)  Reason for designation

The Site is exceptional for its abundance and diversity of breeding
seabirds (e.g. Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, c. 40,000 pairs; blue-
eyed shags, Phalacrocorax atriceps, c. 300 pairs; southern giant petrels,
Macronectes giganteus, c. 200 pairs; dominican gulls, Larus dominicanus, c.
60 breeding pairs, total adult birds c. 200; south polar skuas, Catharacta
maccormicki, 30 breeding pairs, total adult birds c. 200; Wilson's storm
petrels, Oceanites oceanicus, several hundred pairs).  The giant petrel
colony is the farthest south known breeding population, while the blue-eyed
shags are very close to the southern limit of their breeding range.  Avian
Island is therefore of outstanding ornithological importance and merits
protection from unnecessary human disturbance.

(iii)  Outline of research

None currently proposed but protection is justified to safeguard the avian
populations from potential tourist visits and other disturbance, for the
reasons outlined in (ii).

(iv)  Date of expiry of designation

31 December 1999.

(v)  Access points

None specified.

(vi)  Pedestrian and vehicular routes

Vehicles should not be used within the Site.  No pedestrian routes need to
be marked, but every care must be taken to avoid unnecessary disturbance of
the avifauna. No helicopter landings should be made anywhere on the
island.

MOUNT FLORA, HOPE BAY, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA

1.  GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION

Mt. Flora (63°25'S, 57°01'W) is situated c. 1 km south of Hope Bay and c. 1 
km south-east of the Argentine station Esperanza, at the northern tip of 
Trinity Peninsula.

2.  MANAGEMENT PLAN

(i)  Description of site

The Site comprises the upper slopes of Mt. Flora above 250 m altitude where 
the plant-beds of sandstone and siltstone crops out as a distinct black 
band between the lower band of conglomerates and light coloured volcanic 
rocks which cap the mountain.

(ii)  Reason for designation

The site is of exceptional scientific importance for its rich fossil flora. 
It was one of the first fossil floras discovered in Antarctica and has 
played a significant stratigraphic role in deducing the geological history 
of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Its long history as an easily accessible site 
and the large amount of fossilferous debris occuring in scree has made it 
vulnerable to souvenir collectors, and the amount of material available for 
serious research has been considerably depleted.  For this reason the Site 
merits urgent protection.

(iii)  Outline of research

None specified.  Designation as an SSSI is justified by the exceptional 
scientific interest of the site and the vulnerability of its fossils to 
over collecting.

(iv)  Date of expiry of designation

31 December 1999

(v)  Access points

None specified.

(vi)  Pedestrian and vehicular routes

None specified.

(vii)  Other kinds of scientific investigations which would not cause 
harmful interference

None specified.
