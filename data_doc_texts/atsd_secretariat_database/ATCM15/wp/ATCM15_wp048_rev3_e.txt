DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON ANTARCTIC ICE

(Submitted by the Delegation of Chile)
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

THE REPRESENTATIVES,

CONSIDERING that the ice existing in Antarctica represents the world's largest freshwater reserve ;

NOTING that, once properly developed, technology would make it possible to take advantage of icebergs becoming detached from the continent to cater for freshwater requirements, especially in areas near to coasts ;

RECALLING the principles enshrined in the Antarctic Treaty, which lay down a regime for international co-operation guaranteeing that Antarctica shall continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord ;

CONVINCED that the structure established under the Antarctic Treaty has proved effective in promoting international harmony, in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter ;

CONCERNED that uncontrolled activities relating to the exploitation of Antarctic icebergs could also have an adverse effect on the unique Antarctic environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems ;

NOTING that sufficient scientific information is not yet available on the prejudicable effects on the environment and atmospheric circulation which might occur in the event of floating icebergs being used for that purpose ;

NOTING that the harvesting of ice in the coastal regions of Antarctica, especially if this were to require land-based installations, could give rise to a number of additional environmental or other issues ;

ACKNOWLEDGING that the Antarctic Treaty is the most appropriate framework for fostering international relations guaranteeing the protection of the environment and giving impetus to the freedom of scientific research and co-operation in Antarctica ;

RECOGNIZING the desirability that commercial exploitation of Antarctic ice not occur, in any case, prior to examination by the Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty of the issues posed by such activity ;

RECOMMEND THAT THEIR GOVERNMENTS :

1. Exchange information and invite SCAR, as appropriate through the National Antarctic Committes, to :
INTRODUCTION

At the Preparatory Meeting held in May last, the Delegation of 
Chile presented information document IP.10 concerning Antarctic 
Ice, in which it briefly described the potential importance and 
complexity of the issue.

This issue has come to be raised since studies and negotiations 
commenced on a regime aimed at regulating activities for 
exploiting the mineral resources of the Antarctic. In that 
connection, it is necessary to recall the statement made in 
SCAR's E.A.M.R.E.A. report presented at the IXth Consultative 
Meeting, particularly with regard to icebergs as a potential 
freshwater source, and in the report of the I.U.C.N/SCAR Group 
of May 1986 relating to long-term conservation in the 
Antarctic. This issue was also briefly considered at the XIIth 
and XIIIth Consultative Meetings. However, the subject has be 
no means been exhausted and more specific studies and more far-
reaching consideration of the legal and environmental aspects 
are needed.

The Delegation of Chile considers that until the requisite 
studies have been completed and the subject examined in depth, 
it would be advisable to agree to a voluntary moratorium 
regarding the exploitation of Antarctic Ice.

Moreover, SCAR should be requested to make a more specific 
evaluation, based on the available information, as to the 
possible environmental impact in the event of such activities 
being carried out.
i) provide advice on the feasability of commercial 
exploitation of icebergs, relevant technologies and possible 
environmental impacts;

ii) continue to co-ordinate research programmes in polar 
glaciology, biology, oceanography, and meteorology in relation 
to Antarctic ice;

2. Include an item on "Antarctic Ice" on the agenda of the 
XVIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
