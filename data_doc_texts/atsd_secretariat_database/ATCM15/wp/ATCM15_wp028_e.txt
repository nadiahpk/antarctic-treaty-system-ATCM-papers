(Working paper submitted by the Delegation of the United
Kingdom and the Delegation of the German Democratic Republic)
(Note : this working paper is written in the form of draft paragraphs for the Report, without prejudice to further discussion in the Meeting).

The German Democratic Republic submitted a proposal for creating a new Site of Special Scientific Interest at Ardley Island, Maxwell Bay, King George Island (INF/24). This had been drafted by the group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). It had not at that time received the full scrutiny of SCAR but would be submitted for approval at XXI SCAR in Brazil in 1990. If, as seemed likely, it were approved there, it would be passed through National Committees to Governments for consideration at a subsequent Consultative Meeting.

The Meeting noted the significance of bird and plant communities at Ardley Island to the Antarctic environment, and the importance of research work being carried out there, notably by scientists from Chile and from the German Democratic Republic, and agreed to take note of the provisions of the draft management plan for Ardley Island contained in the paper (INF/24) submitted by the German Democratic Republic.
