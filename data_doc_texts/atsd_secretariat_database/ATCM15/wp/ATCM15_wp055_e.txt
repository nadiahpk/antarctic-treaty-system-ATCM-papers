DRAFT RECOMMENDATION : COOPERATION IN THE HYDROGRAPHIC 
CHARTING OF ANTARCTIC WATERS.

The Representatives,

Recognising the importance and historical value of activities 
carried out by the countries who developed the present status 
of Antarctic hydrography;

Aware that there have been significant increases in both the 
number and size of vessels operating in Antarctic waters in 
recent years;

Recognising that severe environmental concitions in the Antarc -
tic give rise to particular risks for shipping and hydrographic 
activities.

Recognising that sea ice concitions can lead to the diversion 
of shipping from acknowledged routes, thus requiring the exten-
sion of charting into waters contiguous with such routes;

Conscious that the safety of life at sea and the protection of 
the Antarctic marine environment and dependent and associated 
ecosystems requires that the Consultative Parties should take 
all possible steps open the them to ensure the safety of navi-
gation and therefore that maritime accidents are reduced to a 
minimum by improving the charting of Antarctic waters;

Recognising that the resources available to devote to hydrogra-
phic survey and the accurate positioning and depiction of the 
Antarctic coastline are scarce;

Conscious of the benefits to be gained by making provision for 
international cooperation between those countries which unċertake 
hydrographic surveys and charting of Antarctic waters and of 'uti-
lising to the maximum extent cooperative arrangements wich alreaćy 
exist.routinely between hydrographic offices and therefore, of 
the need to avoid the establishment of a parallel system;
Aware of the role traditionally played by the International
Hydrographic Organization in contributing to cooperation
between hydrografic offices, and by the Scientific Commitee on
Antarctic Research in all cartographic and other scientific
activities in Antarctica;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They increase their mutual cooperation in the
   hydrographic survey and charting of Antarctic
   waters in order to contribute to the safety of
   navigation, the protection of the Antarctic envi-
   ronment and dependent and associated ecosystems,
   and for scientificpurposes; and that,

2. For the purposes of hydrographic survey and char-
   ting and associated terrestrial surveys and mapping,
   they coordinate their activities within the frame-
   works of the International Hydrographic Organization
   and the ScientificCommittee on Antarctic Research,
   as appropiate.
