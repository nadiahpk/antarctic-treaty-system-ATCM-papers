REPORT LANGUAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
Report language for environmental monitoring

The question of the need for environmental monitoring
arose in connection with seveal agenda items, including items
7,8,9,10,12, and 13.

The United States introduced a draft Recommendation (WP )
intended to synthesize the various concerns expressed into an
integrated course of action. The draft Recommendation
emphasized the need for environmental monitoring both with
respect to the effects of human activity in Antarctica and
regarding the importance of Antarctica as an ideal location for
monitoring early indicators of global environmental change.

After discussion, the Meeting adopted Recommendation XV-
which calls on governments to continue and as appropriate,
expand monitoring of global environmental change as well as
local monitoring programs related to human activities. In
addition, governments were urged to maintain accurate records
of materials introduced into and removed from Antarctica and to
establish cooperative working relationships with other
international organizations involved or interected in
environmental monitoring.

Finally, it was agreed that governments should work
together to identify cooperative long term monitoring programs,
methods for the collection and handling of data and the
environmental parameters to be measured.

Draft Recommendation

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING IN ANTARCTICA

The Representatives,

Recognizing that, because of its relatively pristine state,
Antarctic provides an important natural laboratory to obtain
baseline information on Antarctic environments and for
detecting and monitoring some of the effects of human
activities on the global environments and ecosystems upon which
the welfare and survival of the human species depend;

Recognizing also that scientific research, related logistic
support activities, tourism, resource activities, and other
human activities in Antarctica could have local, regional, or
global environmental effects, or compromise the scientific
value of Antarctica;

Recalling the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)
response to Recommendation XII-3 and Recommendation XIV-2,
which call upon the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to
establish programs for detecting and monitoring the effects of
human activities on key components of Antarctic ecosystems;

Conscious that determining cause-effect relationships between
certain human activities and observed changes in Antarctic
environments will require knowledge of natural variation in
Antarctic environments and accurate records of such things as 
the types and quantities of fuels used to supply heat and light 
to Antarctic stations and to operate aircraft and land vehicles 
in Antarctica;

Aware of the ecosystem monitoring program being developed to 
help meet the objectives of the Convention on the Conservation 
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources;

Desiring to identify and initiate cooperative, long-term 
monitoring programs necessary to verify the predicted effects 
and to detect and quantify the possible unforeseen effects of 
human activities on the Antarctic environment; and

Recognizing that the design and implementation of integrated, 
comprehensive, and cost-effective environmental monitoring 
programs in Antarctica serve both scientific and environmental 
protection purposes,

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They encourage their national Antarctic programs, 
individually and collectively, to continue and, as appropriate, 
expand programs in Antarctica aimed at detecting and monitoring 
global environmental change, including its effects on the ozone 
layer over Antarctica, effects on Antarctic terrestrial, 
marine, and atmospheric environments and dependant and 
associated ecosystems as well as effects on Antarctic living 
resources;

2. They undertake, individually and collectively, to 
establish environmental monitoring programs to verify the 
predicted effects and to detect the possible unforeseen effects 
on Antarctic environments, dependent and associated ecosystems, 
or living resources activities in the Antarctic Treaty area, 
including

- waste disposal
- contamination by oil or other hazardous or toxic 
substances;
- construction and operation of stations, field camps, 
and related ship, aircraft and other logistic support 
facilities;
- conduct of science programs;
- recreational activities; and
- those affecting the purposes of designated protected 
areas;

3. They take such steps as necessary to maintain accurate 
records of the activities of their national programs in 
Antarctica, including, among other things, maintaining accurate 
records of the types and quantities of fuels and other 
materials transported to and used to support their national 
programs in Antarctica, the types and quantities of materials 
subsequently removed from Antarctica, and the types and 
quantities of materials disposed of in Antarctica by various 
means, bearing in mind Recommendation XV- ;
4. They initiate work to identify:

a. the types of cooperative, long term monitoring 
programs that would be useful for detecting, quantifying,
monitoring, and determining the likely causes of observed
changes in air, snow and water quality, and other key features
of Antarctic environments, dependent and associated ecosystems,
or living resources;

b. the methods that should be used to collect, report,
store, exchange, and analyze needed data; and

c. where, how, and how frequently various environmental
parameters should be measured;

To this end, they invite SCAR through their national
committees, to consider and provide advice on the above
matters;

5. They exchange information and establish cooperative
working relations with those Specialized Agencies of the United
Nations and other international organizations having a
scientific or technical interest in Antarctica that are engaged
in the planning and implementation of related scientific
research and environmental monitoring programs.
