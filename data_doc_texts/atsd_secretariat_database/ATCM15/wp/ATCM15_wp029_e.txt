COMPARABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF ANTARCTIC SCIENTIFIC DATA

The Representatives,

Recalling :

i)      Recommendation XIII-5 inviting the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer scientific advice on how to improve the comparability and accessibility of Antarctic scientific data ;

ii)     that    the Report of the XIVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting identified two important initial steps to improve data comparability and accessibility, those of determining types of useful data for management and assessment and the development of a directory ;

Noting :

i)      that the Report of XX SCAR responds to Recommendation XIII-5 by describing several steps needed for the establishment of an Antarctic data system and by calling for the establishment of a group of specialists to advise on the development of such a system ;

ii)     that the Report of XX SCAR identifies the development of national directories of Antarctic data as the logical first step in the development of a data system ;

Desiring to create an Antarctic scientific data system for use in facilitating environmental assessment and monitoring and the promotion of scientific research ;

Recommend to their Governments that :

1)      through their National Committees they encourage SCAR to establish a group of data specialists ;

2)      they develop and make available to SCAR and other Antarctic Treaty Parties a directory listing where and in what format Antarctic scientific data now exist ; and

3)      they convene, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, a Meeting of Experts to consider how to establish an Antarctic scientific data system, including, inter alia :

        a)      the creation of an Antarctic Scientific Data Directory ;

        b)      a program of work describing other next steps needed to create an Antarctic Scientific Data System ;
c) technologies useful in the creation of an Antarctic 
Scientific Data System ;

d) environmental parameters which should be monitored in 
Antarctica.
