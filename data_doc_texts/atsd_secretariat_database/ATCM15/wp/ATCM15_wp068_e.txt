Draft Report language and recommendations on Agenda item 10 (d)
(iv): Establishment of a Multiple-Use Category of Antarctic
Protected Area

Recommendation XIII-5 called upon Antarctic Treaty Parties,
through their national committees, to invite the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to consider and provide
advice on measures that might usefully be taken to improve the
system of protected areas in the Antarctic. In ist response
provided in a Report entitled "The Protected Area System in the
Antarctic", SCAR recommended among other things that an
additional category of protected area be established to provide
for coordinated management of activitites in areas where
multiple activities may interfere with one another or cause
cumulative environmental impacts.

The SCAR recommendation was considered at XIV ATCM. Several
delegations were of the view that the concept of multiple-use
planning in Antarctica was not well enough developed, either
operationally or conceptually, to act on the SCAR
recommendation. It was suggested and agreed that, in order to
obtain a better idea of the scope and possible consequences of
the proposed multiple-use category of Antarctic Protected Area
(APA), it would be helpful if illustrative management plans for
several possible APAs could be prepared and distributed at the
Preparatory Meeting for XV ATCM; In response to this
suggestion, the delegations of Australia, the United Kingdom,
and the United States prepared and at the Preparatory Meeting
for XV ATCM circulated illustrative draft management plans for:
the Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land (XV Prep ); 
Signy Island, South Orkney Islands (XV Prep ); and the area
around Palmer Station on Anvers Island (XV Prep8).

To further facilitate consideration of this matter at XV ATCM,
the United States delegation tabled a draft recommendation (XV
ATCM/WP/38) to establish a new, multi-purpose category of
Antarctic Protected Area. In addition, the delegations of
Australia and the United Kingdom tabled revisions of their
illustrative draft management plans for the Vestfold Hills (XV
ATCM/INF/32) and Signy Island (XV ATCM/INF/43).

During discussion of this matter a XV ATCM, there was
recognition that the expanding scale and scope of activities in
Antarctica were increasing the risk of activities interfering
with each other and causing cumulative environmental impacts,
particulary in certain high-use areas. There also was
recognition that the risk of interference and possible
cumulative environmental impacts could be avoided oo minimized
by cooperative planning and coordination of activities in areas
where a variety of activities were ongoing or planned. However,
a number of delegations expressed doubt about the need for and
the practical application of multiple-use plannig techniques in
Antarctica. Concerns were expressed that --- while it was not
intended --- designation of Antarctic Protected Areas, as
recommended  by  SCAR  and  provided  for  in  the  draft 
recommendation tabled by the United States, might result in 
restricting access to parts of Antarctica and the freedom of 
scientific  research guaranteed  by  the  Antarctic  Treaty. 
Further, uncertainties were noted as to who would be able to 
propose designating APA's and related management plans; how 
proposals would be developed, considered, and approved; who 
would  be  responsible  for  implementing  approved  management 
plans; and how approved plans would be revised and updated to 
take account of changing circumtansces (e.g., termination of or 
change in ongoing activities, or initiation of new activities). 
Also,  uncertinties  were  noted  as  to  the  size  and  number  of 
areas that mignt be proposed for designation as APAs.

The exchange of views on this matter indicated that some of 
this uncertainty was caused by use of the term "Antarctic 
Protectid Area". To some, this term implied that the purpose of 
APAs was simply to protect areas that may be damaged by the 
cumulative  effects  of  multiple  activities  in  those  areas. 
During the debate it was noted that the purpose may be two-
fold:

        (1) to promote cooperative planning and coordination 
of activities so as to avoid or minimize the risk of 
ongoing and planned activities interfering with one 
another in designated areas; and

        (2)  to  avoid  environmental  damage  due  to  the 
cumulative effects of such activities.

It was agreed that a more accurate and descriptive term would 
be "Multiple-Use Planning Area (MPA)." It also was agreed that 
the proposed recommendation should be revised to more clearly 
reflect the following understandings:

* MPAs  would  improve  protection  of  environmental 
values  by  promoting  cooperative  planning  and 
coordination of human activities in Antarctic areas 
where such activities may interfere with one another 
and would help avoid or minimize the cumulative 
impacts  of  such  activities  on  the  Antarctic 
environment;

* the number and size of MPAs should be kept to the 
minimum necessary  to  accomplish  their  intended 
purpose;

* MPAs  should  be  used  to  assist  in  cooperatively 
planning and coordinating activities only in areas 
where there is reason to believe that such activities 
are interfering or likely will interfere with one 
another or cause cumulative environmental impacts, 
and where such interference or environmental impacts 
can  be  avoided  or  minimized  by  preparing  and 
implementing an agreed management plan:
* management plans should be developed through consultations among the Parties conducting and planning activities that could be affected by the and should be subject to approval by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties; 

* proposed management plans should be provided to SCAR, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine living Resources, and as appropriate to other components of the Antarctic Treaty System for review and comment before they are considered by the Consultative Parties, and any comments provided should be considered by the Parties when deciding whether to approve proposed plans;

* management plans should be reviewed and updated periodically to take account of changing circumstances and to ensure that they are accomplishing their stated objectives; and

* pending development of practical experience in preparing and implementing agreed management plans for Multiple-Use Planning Areas, Parties will voluntarily take account of approved plans as they do approved plans for Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).

The proposed recommendation was revised to reflect these understandings and was adopted as Recommendation XV -
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION XV-

ESTABLISHMENT OF MULTIPLE-USE PLANNING AREAS (MPAs)

The Representatives,

Desiring to protect and maintain the unique biological, geological, glaciological, geomorph@logical, ecological, scientific, historic, aesthetic, scenic and wilderness values of Antarctica;

Recalling Recommendation XIII-5(i) inviting the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer advice on the system of protected areas in the Antarctic;

Noting that SCAR's response to Recommendation XIII-5(i), provided in its report "The Protected Area System in the Antarctic", recommended among other things that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties create an additional category of protected area where coordinated management of activities would minimize harmful environmental impacts so as not to detract from the values for which the area was designated;

Recalling the importance of preserving the freedom of scientific research guaranteed by the Antarctic Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1) They take cooperative action to ensure that ongoing and planned human activities in Antarctica, through their combined or cumulative effects, do not result in mutual interference or in adverse impacts upon the Antarctic environment;

2) As one means to this end, they designate, where appropriate, Multiple-Use Planning Areas (MPAs) to assist in coordinating human activities in those areas where such activities pose identified risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts;

3) The number and size of MPAs be kept to the minimum necessary to meet the objectives set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2;
4) Each Multiple-Use Planning Area shall be designated pursuant 
to  a management plan developed through consultations, as 
appropriate, among interested Parties and approved by the 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. Such plan shall, as 
appropriate, include:

    a) a description of the purposes and objectives of 
the management plan;

    b) a description of the area to which its provisions 
apply;

    c)  a description of ongoing and planned human 
activities, including the operation of research 
stations and related logistics activities;

    d) identification of any Specially Protected Areas 
(SPAs), Sites of Special Scientific Interests 
(SSSIs), Specially Reserved Areas (SRA), and Historic 
Monuments (HMs) within the MPA;

    e) a description of the environmental characteristics 
and  features and subjects of current and planned 
scientific research, if any, threatened by 
interference among ongoing or planned human 
activities or their cumulative impacts;

    f)  specific measures to avoid or minimize mutual 
interference and cumulative impacts, including where 
necessary measure applicable to:

       i) construction and operation of stations and 
related logistic support facilities;

      ii) vessel operations, including identification 
of areas which are unsafe for navigation, 
designation of safe anchorages and sea lanes or 
channels for safe access to stations;

     iii) small boat operations, including 
maintenance and discharge control , and 
identification of areas where operations should 
be prohibited (except for essential research);

      iv) aircraft and helicopter operations, 
including designation of safe landing areas, and 
identification of areas where operations below a 
designated altitude should be prohibited;

       v) vehicle operations, including maintenance and 
discharge controls and identification of areas 
which are unsafe or unsuitable for operation;
vi) scientific research activities, including means to ensure the availability of up-to-date information about the nature and location of ongoing or planned field work, and means to prevent disturbance of organisms or features being studied by various-investigators;

vii) visitors, including designation of areas within which access by tourists or other visitors should be limited or prohibited, and/or as areas to which such access might be directed to obtain maximum benefit from exposure to the characteristics of the area;

viii) information, including means to ensure that all individuals present of intending to be present within the MPA, are fully aware of the provisions of the management plan, as well as other relevant measures adopted by the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty (e.g. provisions governing access to scientific stations);

ix) notification, as far in advance as possible, by each Party of research and other activities which it or its nationals intend to carry out in the MPA, including copies of any necessary permits issued;

x) annual reports by each Party of activities it or its nationals carried out in the MPA, of measures taken to ensure compliance with the provisions of the MPA management plan and any instances of possible violations of the management plan;

g) provisions for periodically reviewing the plan to identify changes that may be necessary to take account of changing circumstances or to better accomplish their purposes;

5) They invite SCAR, through their national committees, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and, as appropriate, other components of the Antarctic Treaty System to review and comment on proposed management plans for Multiple-Use Planning Areas before designation is considered by the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty; and

6) They periodicaly review management plans to ensure that they are being implemented effectualy and, as appropriate, approve proposed changes necessary to take account of changing circumstances or to better accomplish their purposes.
