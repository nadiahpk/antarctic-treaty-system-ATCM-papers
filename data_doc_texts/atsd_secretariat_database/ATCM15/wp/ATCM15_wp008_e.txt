COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF
THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
AND DEPENDENT AND ASSOCIATED ECOSYSTEMS

A Working Paper
Submitted by
the United States

It is the United States view that the Parties to the
Antarctic Treaty have a shared commitment to see that all human
activities in Antarctica are conducted so as to avoid adverse
impacts upon the Antarctic environment. Through the operation
of the Antarctic Treaty system, a wide range of steps have been
taken to secure protection of the environment. These include
the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty itself, agreed
recommendations setting forth guidelines, procedures and
legally binding measures, and separate international agreements.

At the same time, it is clear that there is need for
continual revision and extension of this network of
environmental provisions as the ambit and scale of activities
in Antarctica grows. During the last decade, for example,
there has been significant expansion of human presence in
Antarctica, as witnessed by increased numbers of scientists,
support personnel and tourists, as well as growth in research
bases and logistics activities and facilities. Taken together,
these trends have intensified and will continue to intensify
environmental stress in Antarctica, including challenges to its
values as a wilderness area and scientific laboratory for
studying processes of regional and global significance.

For these reasons, the United States supports concerted
action to ensure achievement of comprehensive protection of the
Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.
Meeting and sustaining this objective will require that the
Parties to the Antarctic Treaty proceed on the basis of a clear
and integrated program of work.

Elements: The starting point for such a program of work
should be a delineation of the individual elements that need to
be addressed in the aggregate of comprehensive measures.
Taking into account the work already set forth in other working
papers on this item, the United States delegation believes that
these elements can be identified as follows:

Standards and Procedures:

a) protection of native mammals and native birds;
b) protection of native plants;
- 2 -

c) prevention of the introduction of alien species;

d) area protection

    i) Specially Protected Areas (SPAs);

   ii) Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs);

  iii) Historic Sites and Monuments;

   iv) Antarctic Protected Areas (APAs);

    v) other categories of protected area;

e) waste disposal;

f) storage and handling of fuel and hazardous materials;

g) marine pollution;

h) air pollution;

   i) pollution response and contingency planning, including actions and procedures in emergency situations and provision for containment and clean up capability;

j) technical criteria and standards;

k) environmental impact assessment;

l) inspection, information exchange, reporting and other means to ensure compliance;

m) liability; and

n) monitoring (used in this paper to mean the collection of time series of scientific and environmental data);.

Activities:

a) scientific research and associated logistic activities, including scientific drilling;

b) station construction and siting;

c) tourism and non-governmental expeditions;

d) uses of Antarctic ice;

(It should be noted that this list rests on the assumption that 
the acceptability and specific control of possible resource 
activities in Antarctica will be carried out pursuant to the 
Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS), the 
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR); and the Convention on the Regulation of 
Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (the Antarctic Minerals 
.Convention.))

Appraisal Criteria:  The U.S. delegation believes that the 
Parties to the Treaty should undertake a thorough appraisal of 
the existing network of environmental protection measures and 
the degree to which they adequately and effectively address the 
elements (standards and procedures and activities) listed above 
in order to:

    a)  identify those provisions which should be updated, 
strengthened or otherwise improved;

    b)  identify and fill in the gaps in the existing network 
of environmental protection;

    c)  clarify and strengthen the nature of the legal 
obligations assumed by Treaty Parties in relation to 
environmental protection provisions;

    d)  ensure integration and consistency among the various 
categories of environmental protection provisions;

    e)  ensure the conduct of monitoring necessary to assess 
the effectiveness of the environmental protection 
provisions and to identify the need for strengthening and 
supplementing them; and

    f)  ensure establishment of an information and data base 
adequate to support the effective implementation and, 
where necessary, revision and extension of environmental 
protection provisions.

Milestones:  The United States delegation further believes 
that, as a result of this appraisal, the Parties to the Treaty 
should establish concrete objectives for the immediate and 
longer term future.  These include:

    a)  specific actions to be taken at the Fifteenth 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XV);

    b)  concrete proposals for structuring the future work to 
be undertaken by the Treaty Parties; and
- 4 -

c)   subject areas upon which additional information is 
required as a basis for consideration of specific measures 
by the Treaty Parties.

Areas of Emphasis:  The program of work relating to 
comprehensive measures outlined above results in three major 
areas of emphasis:  first, ensuring that all activities in 
Antarctica are subject to effective standards and procedures 
for environmental protection; second, ensuring that clear and 
enforceable obligations are established; and third, elaborating 
mechanisms to ensure that standards and procedures are 
effectively implemented, consistently applied, and kept up to 
date.

Standards and Procedures:  This first area of emphasis has 
been to date the primary object of attention by the Treaty 
Parties, though, as illustrated by the agenda of ATCM XV, there 
remains significant work to be done.

Specifically, the United States believes that there are 
steps to be taken at ATCM XV in this area which would make a 
major contribution to the elaboration of comprehensive measures 
for protection of the environment.  These include:

a)   adoption of an updated, strengthened and legally 
enforceable set of waste disposal practices as recommended 
by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

b)   further development of the system of protected areas 
for Antarctica;

c)   adoption of concrete measures to prevent marine 
pollution, including commitment to strict application of 
existing international marine pollution conventions in 
Antarctica, as well as steps to provide response 
capability to pollution incidents;

d)   steps to improve navigational charts for Antarctica 
and to ensure widespread and ready availability of such 
charts; and 

e)   further work to develop collective criteria and 
procedures for the effective implementation of 
environmental impact assessment procedures, as a follow up 
to Recommendation XIV-2.

Clear and Enforceable Obligations:  It is also the view of 
the United States delegation that this second area of emphasis 
merits priority attention in order to keep pace with the 
"standard and procedures" side.  One of the most important
- 5 -

contributions that could be made to achieving an effective and 
comprehensive network of environmental protection measures is 
to ensure that these measures (existing and future) are 
formulated so as to make clear to governments and all those 
involved in activities in Antarctica the legal requirements and 
obligations that they must observe in carrying out such 
activities.  This could clarify for Parties newly active in 
Antarctica as well as for private expeditions and tourist 
groups subject to the jurisdiction of Antarctic Treaty Parties 
that they must comply with such requirements and obligations. 
In its approach to waste disposal, to marine pollution and to 
the protected area system, for example, the United States has 
sought not only to articulate effective standards but to cast 
them as clear and enforceable obligations.  Such formulation 
could add significantly to the ability of the Treaty Parties to 
ensure effective and consistent compliance with environmental 
protection measures.

Mechanisms:  This third area of emphasis also bears 
directly on the effectiveness of comprehensive measures.  In 
the United States' view, it is essential to ensure that the 
framework of such measures is dynamic - capable of evolving as 
necessary to achieve environmental protection objectives in 
light of new information and knowledge, as well as new 
activities and circumstances.  The United States believes the 
questions of environmental monitoring, data and information, 
and infrastructure require immediate attention if the Treaty 
Parties are to utilize the ATCM mechanism most effectively to 
achieve the objective of comprehensive measures.

Environmental Monitoring:  The increasing intensity of 
human activities affecting Antarctica emphasizes the importance 
of monitoring programs to identify and keep under review 
impacts upon the environment.  The issue of environmental 
monitoring is a key component in addressing comprehensive 
measures and is directly linked to the following items on the 
agenda of ATCM XV:

    Item 8 - the Role of Antarctica in Understanding and 
Monitoring Global Change, including the Ozone Layer;

    Item 9(a) - Waste Disposal (the SCAR report on waste 
disposal calls for research and monitoring in this area);

    Item 9 (b) - Marine Pollution;

    Item 9 (c) - Implementation of Environmental Impact 
Procedures (Recommendation XIV-2 calls for monitoring of 
key indicators of the environmental effects of activities 
in Antarctica;
- 6 -

Item 10 - the Antarctic Protected Area System (Management 
plans for protected areas will call for monitoring to 
ensure that they achieve their designated purpose; more 
broadly, protected areas offer the opportunity for 
monitoring environmental change and the effects of human 
activities in Antarctica, including the establishment of 
baselines.

Item 11 - Promotion of International Scientific 
Cooperation;

Item 13 - Effects of Tourism and Non-Governmental 
Expeditions in the Antarctic Treaty Area.

As is obvious from these items, the conduct of monitoring 
is increasingly recognized as essential to securing protection 
of the Antarctic environment.  Equally important, monitoring 
has emerged as a key part of programs of scientific research in 
Antarctica, which remains the most important human activity in 
the Treaty area.

For these reasons, the United States believes that ATCM XV 
offers the opportunity to initiate work toward comprehensive, 
integrated and cost-effective monitoring programs for 
Antarctica to serve both scientific and environmental 
protection purposes.  Specifically, the United States 
delegation would suggest adoption of a recommendation on 
monitoring, including recognition of the principle that 
monitoring to obtain baseline information on the Antarctic 
environment and to detect the impacts of human activities is 
integral to the conduct of such activities.

Data and Information:  To achieve effective comprehensive 
measures, it will be necessary that there exist appropriate 
mechanisms to provide for compilation, review and utilization 
of relevant data and information, particularly to ensure that 
the results of monitoring and scientific research are 
effectively applied in assessing, and where necessary revising 
and extending, environmental standards and procedures applied 
to human activities.  Item 12 (a) of the agenda of ATCM XV - 
Improving the Comparability and Accessibility of Scientific 
Data in Antarctica - specifically addresses this point and the 
United States supports further work at ATCM XV to identify, 
develop and integrate a scientific and environmental data base 
for Antarctica.

Infrastructure to Provide an Integrated Data Base:  From 
the broader perspective, the issue of data and information 
directly relates to the question of infrastructure for the 
Antarctic Treaty consultative mechanism and to the frequency of
- 7 -

ATCMs.  In the United States view, the Treaty Parties, at ATCM 
.XV, should initiate action to address both the scientific and 
environmental data base and the requirements for the support of 
the Antarctic Treaty consultative mechanism (see the U.S. paper 
on this subject).  Such action is necessary to ensure that they 
are in a position to effectively manage activities which 
increasingly require attention on a real time basis.  Therefore 
two important aspects in attaining the objective of 
comprehensive environmental protection measures are:

  o  a practical and expeditious process within the 
consultative mechanism to allow measures to be updated in 
light of new stresses upon the Antarctic environment, as 
well as in light of new information on adverse impacts or 
on technologies and procedures that could avoid or 
mitigate such impacts; and

  o  effective communication with relevant international 
organizations to take advantage of the possibility of 
reinforcing the application of ATCM measures through 
broader fora (as has been suggested in the U.S. paper on 
marine pollution) and to ensure that ATCM measures are no 
less strict than relevant environmental protection 
standards adopted pursuant to more broadly applicable 
agreements (e.g., those on marine pollution, atmospheric 
pollution and hazardous waste).

In relation to the first point, the more complete the 
integrated data base serving the Antarctic Treaty, the more 
readily will the Parties be able to discern and anticipate 
possible environmental problems and identify low-impact, cost 
effective technologies and procedures for operating in 
Antarctica.  This capability would make an essential 
contribution to efforts to revise and elaborate ATCM measures 
to avoid adverse environmental impacts in the future.
