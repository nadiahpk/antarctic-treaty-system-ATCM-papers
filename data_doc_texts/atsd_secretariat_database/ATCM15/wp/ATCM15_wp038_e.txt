SCAR RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHEMENT OF A NEW,
MULTI-PURPOSE CATEGORY OF ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA

Submitted by the delegation of the United States
Recomendation on Antarctic Protected Areas

[Appropriate Preambular Paragraphs]

Recommend to their Governments that:

1) They take action to ensure that human activities in 
Antarctica, through their combined or cumulative effects, do not result in mutual interference or in adverse impacts upon 
the Antarctic environment.

2) As one means to this end, they designate, where 
appropriate, Antarctic Protected Areas (APAs) in which human 
activities would be specifically regulated, including 
limitations upon activities, so as to avoid or minimize such 
mutual interference or adverse impacts.

3) Each Antarctic Protected Area shall be designated 
pursuant to a management plan, approved by the Antarctic 
Treaty Consultative Parties, which shall include:

a) a description of the area to which its provisions 
apply;

b) a description of ongoing and anticipated human 
activities, including the operation of research 
stations and related logistics activities;
- 2 -

c) identification of any Specially Protected Areas 
(SPAs), Sites of Special Scientific Interests (SSSIs), 
Special Reserves, and Historic Monuments within the APA;

d) a description of the environmental characteristics 
and features and areas of current and future scientific 
research opportunities, if any, threatened by 
interference among ongoing or anticipated human 
activities or their cumulative impacts;

e) specific measures to avoid or minimize mutual 
interference and cumulative impacts, including where 
necessary measures applicable to:

     i) vessel operations, including identification of 
areas which are unsafe for navigation, designation 
of safe anchorages and sea lanes or channels for 
safe access to stations;

    ii) small boat operations, including maintenance 
and discharge requirements, and identification of 
areas where operations should be prohibited 
(except for essential research);
- 3 -

iii) aircraft and helicopter operations;
      including designation of safe landing areas, and
      identification of areas where operations below a
      designated altitude should be prohibited;

iv) vehicle operations, including maintenance and
      discharge requirements and identification of areas
      which are unsafe for operation;

v)   scientific research activities, including
      means to ensure the availability of up-to-date
      information about the nature and location of
      ongoing or planned field work and to prevent
      disturbance of research sites or collection or
      disturbance of organisms or features being studied
      by other investigators;

vi)  visitors, including designation of areas
      within which access by tourists or other visitors
      should be limited or prohibited, and/or as areas
      to which such access should be directed to provide
      exposure to the characteristics of the area;

vii) information, including means to ensure that
      all individuals present or intending to be present
      within the APA, are fully aware of the provisions
      of the management plan, as well as other of the
- 4 -

management plan and relevant measures adopted by
the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty (e.g.
provisions governing access to scientific
stations);

viii) notification, as far in advance as
possible, by each Party of. research and other
activities which it or its nationals intend to
carry out in the APA, including copies of any
necessary permits issued;

ix) annual reports by each Party of activities it
or its nationals carried out in the APA, of
measures taken to ensure compliance with the
provisions of the APA management plan and any
instances of possible violations of the management
plan.

4) They invite SCAR, through their national committees, the
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources, and other components of the Antarctic Treaty
system to review and comment on proposed management plans
for Antarctic Protected Areas before designation is
considered by the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.
