AGREED MEASURES FOR CONSERVATION OF
ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA:
MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR SPECIALLY PROTECTED
AREAS: AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE VIII


The Representatives,

Noting that under Article VIII of the Agreed Measures:

    i)   paragraph 1 provides for designation as Specially
         Protected Areas, "areas of outstanding scientific
         interest...in order to preserve their unique natural
         ecological system";

   ii)   paragraph 2(c) provides that entry into a Specially
         Protected Area is prohibited except in accordance
         with a permit;

  iii)   paragraph 4 provides that such "a permit shall have
         effect within a Specially Protected Area provided
         that:

         (a)    it was issued for a compelling scientific
                purpose which cannot be served elsewhere; and

         (b)    the actions permitted thereunder will not
                jeopardise the natural ecological system
                existing in that Area";

Noting further that Recommendation VII-2 urges that
representative examples of the major Antarctic land and
freshwater ecological systems shall be included in the series
of Specially Protected Area;

Desiring to provide for greater certainty in the interpretation
of paragraph 4 by means of the application of Management Plans
relevant to each Specially Protected Area;
Recognising that to be fully effective such Management Plans must be accorded the same status as the conditions in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 4;

Recommend to their Governments that the following subparagraph be added to paragraph 4 of Article VIII:

"and  (c) the actions permitted thereunder are in accordance with any Management Plan accompanying the description of a Specially Protected Areas."
