SPANISH PROPOSAL                                           Item 16
                                                           on the provisional agenda

Coordination of topographical surveys and hydrographic studies and their
publication in relation with navigational safety standards and scientific
research in Antarctica.

The increase in maritime traffic resulting from the growing interest in
scientific studies, servicing for Bases and tourism, etc., is a matter of
concern to the Spanish Delegation. The Spanish Delegation is of the
opinion that measures designed to improve navigational safety in the
region should be studied. Efforts should be made to apply the means and
processes available through modern technology to bring navigational
conditions in the Arctic seas up to the same security standards as those
applied throughout the rest of the planet.

Hydrography is a science and a technique which is costly from an economic
point of view and is a laborious, slow and risky process especially when
it is carried out in isolated regions or under the usual extreme weather
conditions in the Arctic seas.

Consequently, the Spanish Delegation considers that the time has come
to examine the possibility of joint hydrographic efforts in the region
covered by the Treaty which would make it possible to:
- Promote and recommend hydrographic surveys in the Arctic Seas, notably 
in the regions where traffic is densest, for example, the Base access 
zones as well as the exploration of anchoring zones;

- Propose to the International Hydrographic Organisation, the creation 
of a Hydrographic Regional Commission responsible for the zone covered 
by the Treaty, in order to:

. coordinate hydrographic surveys utilising the resources of the 
international community to their fullest by avoiding the excessive 
concentration of efforts within a given zone and the duplication of 
surveys;

. coordinate and publish the resultant data in line with recommended 
navigational standards by promoting the most suitable recom-
mendations for the distribution of maps of the Antarctic zone;

. Propose the unification of Antarctic toponymy in view of the positive 
effects that would result for navigational safety.
