DRAFT DECLARATION ON THE OZONE LAYER
DRAFT DECLARATION ON THE OZONE LAYER AND CLIMATE CHANGE

The XVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting decided to approve the following declaration :

    The Representatives taking part in the Fifteenth
Antarctic Consultative Meeting

- Recalling : Recommendations I-IV; I-V; II-VIII; V-3; VI-4;
VII-7; VIII-13; IX-5; XII-8; XIII-5 and XIV-10,

- Considering : The essential role of the Antarctic continent
and the Southern Ocean in the Earth's energy budget and ocean
dynamics, including its role in regulating the climate which
has become all the more important because of international
concern with the issue of global climate change;

- Basing themselves : on scientific studies that indicate the
possibility of changes in the physical and chemical composi-
tion of the atmosphere, directly caused by human activity
outside the Area of the Antarctic Treaty and which may  have
harmful effects on human health, on terrestrial and marine
ecosystems and may cause interference with other legitimate
uses of the Antarctic environment;

- Taking into account : with appreciation the work done by
SCAR on assesing the importance of ocean and atmospheric
interactions of the Antarctic ecosystems and the ozone layer;

- Recognizing: the existing activities in the field of monito-
ring the depletion of the ozone layer developed by SCAR throug
its Working Group on Atmospheric Sciences;
2.-

1 Strongly support  the Parties to the Vienna Convention and
its Montreal Protocol in their efforts to eradicate the causes
giving rise to the depletion of the ozone layer, having regard
to  the declaration drawn up in Helsinki in May this year and
the forthcoming  review of the terms of the Montreal Protocol
at Second Meeting of the Parties in London in June 1990.

2 Appeal  to all Antarctic Treaty Parties that have not done so
to consider adherence of the Vienna Convention on the Protection
of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol.

3.- Take note with appreciation of the work being done with
regard to global climate change and encourage UNEP and other
relevant Internationals Organisations, on the basis of proposals
being developed by the UNEP/WMO Intergovernmental  Panel on
Climate Change, to take firm action, through legal instruments
and otherwise, to mitigate  man-induced causes of climate
change.

4.- Urge the Antarctic Treaty Parties to establish, in coordina-
tion with SCAR, cooperative research programmes on the environ-
mental effects of the ozone layer depletion,  including the
functional integrity of ecosystems in the Antarctic Treaty
Area.

5.- Decide  to keep the item on the ozone layer depletion
on the agenda of the XVI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
