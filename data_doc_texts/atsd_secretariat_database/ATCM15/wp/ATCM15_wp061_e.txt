DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON THE CONCENTRATION

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON THE CONCENTRATION
OF THE SITING OF STATIONS

(presented by the delegations of Chile, the United Kingdom,
and Uruguay)

The Representatives,

Reaffirming that freedom of scientific investigation as set out
in Article II of the Antarctic Treaty is one of the fundamental
principles of the Treaty ;

Affirming that measures adopted in this recommendation are not
intended to interfere with the possibility of a non-
Consultative Party establishing a station in Antarctica but to
ensure that such Parties may maximize their contribution to
knowledge and the protection of the Antarctic ;

Recalling Recommendations I-I, VI-4, VII-1, VIII-11, VIII-13,
IX-5, XII-3, and XIV-2 ;

Recalling that at the XIIIth Consultative Meeting,
Recommendation XIII-6.was adopted, calling for consultations
between nations of Antarctic programmes operating existing
stations in the same vicinity ;

Recalling that the Final Report of the XIVth Consultative
Meeting records agreement on the following three points :

a) that new stations had a greater possibility of
maximizing their scientific potential if established
in the widest possible range of areas ;

b) that SCAR had recorded its concern that the
continued increase in the number of stations in some
parts of the Antarctic could result in unproductive
duplication of scientific programmes and that SCAR
had recommended that adequate prior notice be given
of intent to undertake a development or scientific
activity that is likely to have a major environmental
impact; and
c) that what was needed was a process of consultation 
which started as early as possible in the planning 
stage  of  the  new  station  and  continued  through 
subsequent  stages,  including  the  development  and 
implementation of routine operations ;

Recognizing  that the establishment of a new station or major 
logistic support facility is an activity which is likely to 
have more than a minor or transitory effect on the environment 
and is therefore subject to the Comprehensive Environmental 
Evaluation procedure described in Recommendation XIV-2 ;

Bearing  in  mind  that while the establishment  in  the  same 
vicinity of scientific research stations and logistic support 
facilities  may  favour  scientific  co-operation  and  the 
functioning of these stations, the excessive concentration of 
such  installations may have a negative effect on scientific 
activities and on the environment ;

Recommend to their Governments that :

1. They urge Contracting Parties, when considering the 
establishment of new stations or facilities, to take 
the  following  measures  to  avoid  the  excessive 
concentration  in  Antarctica  of  such  stations  or 
facilities :

      a) As  early  as  possible  when  considering  the 
establishment of a new station or facility in 
the vicinity of one or more existing stations or 
facilities, Contracting Parties should initiate, 
through their national Antarctic programme , a 
process  of  consultations,  co-ordination  and 
possible co-operation with the other concerned 
national  Antarctic  programme  or  programmes, 
which should continue  through  the  subsequent 
stages,  including  the  development  and 
implementation of routine logistic operations, 
with a view to minimizing both interference with
existing programmes and impact on the
environment ;
b) Before establishing a new station or facility,
Contracting Parties should prepare a
Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation in
accordance with Recommendation XIV-2 ; and

2. In the case of a station or facility which the
national Antarctic programme of a non-Consultative
Party proposes to establish, they offer assistance to
the managers of that programme with respect to the
choice of site and the preparation of the
Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation, with a view
to maximizing the scientific output of the new
programme and minimizing its environmental impact.
