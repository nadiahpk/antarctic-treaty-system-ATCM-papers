Recalling Article II of the Antarctic Treaty and the
recommendations relating to questions of cooperation in the

Recommendation XIV-10 on the marine meteorological and sea ice

Wishing to act to increase the efficiency and safety of
maritime and air navigation in the Treaty Area on the basis of
international cooperation,

Recommend to their Governments that,

1. They continue to consider ways of developing and
improving meteorological and sea ice information services for
maritime and air navigation in Antarctic Treaty Area.

2. The report of the Leningrad meeting of the group of
experts be referred to the WMO Working Group on Antarctic
Meteorology for formal consideration and comment at its next

association with SCAR, for the purpose of recommending any
appropriate further joint, or individual actions to the next

4. In order to assist in improving meteorological services
to maritime and air navigation, they take prompt measures to
participate in IGOSS, difting-buoy and automatic weather
station programmes to provide maximum data for international
exchange and operational use.
