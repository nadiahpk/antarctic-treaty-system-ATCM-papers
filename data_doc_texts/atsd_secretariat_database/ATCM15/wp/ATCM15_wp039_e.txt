SCAR RECOMMENDATION THAT MANAGEMENT PLANS BE PREPARED AND
ADOPTED FOR SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS (SPAS)
(Submitted by the delegation of the United States)
PREPARATION OF MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Flora 
and Fauna, adopted as Recommendation 8 of the Third Antarctic 
Treaty Consultative Meeting, provide that areas of outstanding 
scientific interest may be designated as "Specially Protected 
Areas", with the unanimous agreement of the Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Parties, and that areas so designated shall be 
afforded special protection "in order to preserve their unique 
natural ecological system." Article VIII of the Agreed Measures 
calls upon the Contracting Parties to prohibit their nationals 
from entering SPAs except in accordance with a permit issued for 
a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere, 
and when the actions authorized by the permit will not jeopardize 
the natural ecological system existing in the SPA.

Neither the Agreed Measures nor the descriptions of 
existing SPAs indicate what would constitute a compelling 
scientific purpose and/or the types of activities which would or 
would not adversely affect the unique ecological system being 
protected by the SPA. Further, the descriptions of existing SPAs, 
provided in Annex B of the Agreed Measures, do not describe the 
precise ecological system or the components of the system that the 
protected area designation is intended to preserve. Consequently, 
the Report of the SCAR ad hoc Group on Additional Protective 
Measures, presented to and considered by the Fourteenth Antarctic 
Treaty Consultative Meeting, recommended among other things that 
management plans be developed and agreed for each existing and all 
future Specially Protected Areas.

The SCAR recommendation could be implemented by requesting 
that the countries which originally proposed designating SPAs 
(i.e., those listed in Annex B of the Agreed Measures) prepare 
improved site descriptions and proposed management plans for those 
areas (for consideration at ATCM XVI), and by requiring that 
future proposals for designation of SPAs be accompanied by 
detailed site descriptions and proposed management plans. 
Minimally, the site descriptions should include:

(1)	a clear description of the location and the key 
        physical and biological features of the area, 
        including a description of the markers and/or 
        natural features that delineate the area; and

(2)	a map and/or photographs showing the boundaries 
        and key features of the area;
The management plan should include:

(1)	a description of the key components of the unique natural ecological system intended to be preserved by the SPA;

(2)	descriptions of the types of activities (including the area) that could jeopardize the unique ecological system intended to be preserved by the SPA; and

(3)	descriptions of steps that should be taken to avoid or minimize damage in cases where access to the SPA is for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere.

Toward this end, the United States proposes adoption of a recommendation along the lines of that which is attached.
Draft Recommendation

DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED DESCRIPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT PLANS 
FOR SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives,

Recalling

(1) 	that the purpose of Specially Protected Areas is to 
preserve the unique natural ecological systems of areas 
of outstanding scientific interest; and

(2) 	that the appropriate national authority of Antarctic 
Treaty Contracting Parties may issue permits authorizing 
its nationals to enter Specially Protected Areas for 
compelling scientific purposes which cannot be served 
elsewhere;

Noting that the descriptions of Specially Protected Areas in Annex 
B of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Flora 
and Fauna do not provide detailed descriptions of the natural 
ecological systems and components thereof that the Protected Areas 
are intended to preserve;

Noting also that the descriptions of Specially Protected Areas do 
not indicate the types of activities that could or could not be 
carried out in the designated Specially Protected Areas without 
harming or damaging any of the components of the natural 
ecological systems that the areas are intended to preserve;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.	They review the descriptions of Specially Protected 
Areas in Annex B of the Agreed Measures and, for those 
Areas which they or their nationals had proposed be 
listed in the Annex, they provide a more detailed 
description of the natural ecological system that the Area 
is intended to preserve and a provisional Area management 
plan for consideration at the XVIth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting;

2.	Future proposals for designating Specially Protected 
Areas include:

	a.	a clear description of the location and the 
key physical and biological features of the 
Area to be protected, including a description of 
the markers and/or natural features that delineate 
the Area;
b. a map and/or photographs showing the boundaries 
   and key features of the proposed Specially Protected 
   Area;

c. a detailed description of the key components 
   of the unique natural ecological system intended to 
   be preserved by designating the Area as a 
   Specially Protected Area;

d. descriptions of the types of activities 
   (including activities outside the Area) that 
   could jeopardize any of the components of the 
   unique ecological system intended to be 
   preserved; and

e. descriptions of steps that should be taken 
   to avoid or minimize damage in cases where 
   access to the Area may be authorized for a 
   compelling scientific purpose which cannot be 
   served elsewhere;

3. They invite SCAR, through their national committees, to 
   have regard to the precading when considering proposals 
   for Specially Protected Areas; and

4. They annually advise SCAR and the Antarctic Treaty 
   Parties of any activities that they authorized to be 
   conducted in Specially Protected Areas during the 
   preceding year and that they expect to authorize in 
   the upcoming year.
