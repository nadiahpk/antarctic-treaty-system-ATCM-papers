Agenda item 12 b

Concentration of siting of stations

The  Meeting  noted  that  in  some  parts  of  the  Antarctic 
concentrations of stations might result in adverse impacts on 
the  environment,  the  improfitable  duplication  of  scientific 
programmes and interference with scientific research. On the 
other  hand,  it  was  noted  that  the  establishment  of  some 
research  stations  in  the  same  vicinity  may  favour  scientific 
and logistic cooperation and enhance safety. Newcomers to the 
Antarctic might benefit from advice on possible locations for 
establishing  stations  so  as  to  maximise  scientific 
opportunities and minimise negative effects.

Papers presented by Chile, the United Kingdom and Uruguay on 
this issue were considered.

After detailed discussion, amongst both Consultative and non-
Consultative Parties, Recommendation XV-  was adopted. This 
urged Contracting Parties, when considering establishing new 
stations,  to  consult  and  coordinate  with  others  concerned  with 
a  view  to  minimising  interference  and  adverse  impacts.  They 
should  prepare  a  Comprehensive  Environmental  Evaluation  in 
accordance  with  Recommendation  XIV-2.  Consultative  Parties 
should assist non-Consultative Parties proposing to establish a 
station with respect to choice of site and the preparation of 
the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation.
