Item 9 (c)

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

New Zealand's approach to the application of environmental
impact assessment procedures is set out in the New Zealand
"Working Paper on the Protection of the Antarctic
Environment" in Document XV ATCM/WP/4. It is recognised,
however, that in view of the relative newness of the
procedures set out in Recommendation XIV-2 and the limited
time available at this Consultative Meeting it is probably
not possible to develop all aspects of these ideas at this
Meeting. Nevertheless, we think it desirable that the
Report of this Consultative Meeting should reflect the
various suggestions that have been made to expand the
scope and application of the procedures contained in
Recommendation XIV-2.

To this end, the following suggestions are put forward for
consideration:

a       The procedures set out in Recommendation XIV-2 should
        be extended to all human activity in Antarctica to
        include, for example, tourism and activities by
        non-Consultative Parties (bearing in mind that CRAMRA
        establishes separate strigent EIA procedures for
        mineral resource activities);

b       There should be agreed criteria to determine whether a
        proposed activity is likely to have a significant
        impact and therefore warrants the preparation of a
        Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation;

c       It should be made clear that the procedures of
        Recommendation XIV-2 apply to all significant changes
        to an activity at any stage of its operation,
        including, for example,  the decommissioning of
        facilities (as recommended by SCAR in 1986);

d       Procedures should be developed to ensure:

        i       that timely notification is given to other Treaty
                Parties that a Comprehensive Environmental
                Evaluation is to be prepared;  and

        ii      that documentation prepared for a Comprehensive
                Environmental Evaluation is given timely
                circulation to other Treaty Parties to ensure
                adequate opportunities for comments to be made and
                to be considered.

A reflection of the those ideas in the Report of this
Meeting would provide a good basis for further substantive
discussion of environmental impact assessment procedures
at subsequent discussions of the Antarctic Treaty Parties.
