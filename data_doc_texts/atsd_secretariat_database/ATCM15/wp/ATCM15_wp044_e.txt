DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED

BY THE DELEGATION OF CHILE

(Preambulatory paragraphs)

RECOMMEND THAT THEIR GOVERNMENTS

1 - Provide their official agencies responsible for regulating tourism   with   increased   facilities   and   authority   for
coordinating and exercising a greater degree of supervision and control over their national operators, in pursuance of the
relevant Recommendations pertaining to the protection of the Antarctic environment.

2 - Adopt in their domestic legislation the requisite legal measures in respect of liability for the damage caused by their
nationals to the Antarctic environment through the development of tourism and non-governmental activities.

3 - Require all those engaging in tourism and non-governmental activities to take out insurance in respect of persons and
means of transport that will at least cover the costs entailed in their rescue.

4 - Plan tourism and non-governmental activities in periods that do interfere with on-going scientific programmes or the
normal operation of the bases during the Antarctic summer.
