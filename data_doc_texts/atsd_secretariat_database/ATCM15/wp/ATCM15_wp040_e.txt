(submitted by the Spanish Delegation)
PRELIMINARY DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON THE 
COORDINATION OF NAUTICAL CHARTS OF THE ANTARCTIC SEAS.
SURVEYS AND THEIR PUBLICATION

The Representatives:

RECOGNISING  the  importance  and  value  of  the  historic 
contribution of nations to the development of current Antarctic 
cartography;

RECOGNISING  the growing value of cartographic surveys of the 
Antarctic seas arising from increased sea traffic in the area 
set  aside  for  scientific  studies,  from  logistical  support 
provided to stations and from tourism, etc.;

RECOGNISING  the difficulties involved in Antarctic cartography 
owing to the extreme climatic and echographic conditions;

RECOGNISING  that Antarctic cartography in its present form is 
unsatisfactory in some areas and incomplete in others;

AWARE  of its highly negative effect on navigational safety and 
its possible repercussions on the Antarctic environment;

CONSIDER  the advantages of promoting international cooperation 
between  countries  taking  an  active  interest  in  Antarctic 
cartography,

RECOGNISING  the role played by the International Hydrographic 
Organisation;

RECOMMEND  to  their  governments  that  they  invite  the 
International Hydrographic Organisation to set up a Commission 
which  would  take  into  account  the specific  technical, 
geographical, legal and political aspects of the Antarctic and 
further  the  coordination  of  concrete  efforts by  nations  in 
Antarctic  cartography,  because  of  its  positive  effect  on 
navigational  safety  and  its  direct  benefits  for  the 
conservation of this unique environment.
