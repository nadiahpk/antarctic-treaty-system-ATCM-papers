REPORTS ON SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST, SPECIALLY
PROTECTED AREAS AND HISTORIC MONUMENTS

(Working paper submitted by the Delegation of the United
Kingdom)
(Note : This Working Paper is submitted in the form of draft paragraphs  for the Report, without  prejudice  for  further discussion).

As noted in the Report of the XIV Consultative Meeting (para. 119), it is stated in relation to the management plans for Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Preambles of the relevant Recommandations (VIII-4, X-5, XIII-8 and XIV-5) that it would be advantageous to gather experience of the practical effect of the management plans. One way of doing this is periodically to visit and report on the state of the Sites. If such reports are made available they will save to provide base-line information on which assessments of the effectiveness of the management plans can be made.

Similarly, reports on visits to Specially Protected Areas and Historic Sites and Monuments will contribute to knowledge of these Areas, Sites and Monuments, allowing the continuing value of Specially Protected Area to the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, on the continuing value of Historic Sites and Monuments to Antarctic cultural values to be assessed.

The Meeting agreed that an appropriate way of making the information available would be append such reports on visits to Specially Protected Areas, Sites of Special Scientific Protected Areas, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and Historic Sites and Monuments, with a minimum of editing, to the account of each Area, Site or Monument in the handbook. This without prejudice to any decision reached as a result of consideration of the whole issue of area protection at the next Consultative Meeting.

The Meeting welcomed reports on visits to Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Specially Protected Areas and Historic Sites and Monuments prepared by New Zealand (INF/-), the United Kingdom (INF/6), the USSR (INF/-) and the United States (INF/-).
