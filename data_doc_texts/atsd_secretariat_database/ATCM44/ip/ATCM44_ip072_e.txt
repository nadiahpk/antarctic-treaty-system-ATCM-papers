Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment: A Decadal Synopsis
and Recommendations for Action
Summary
A major update by SCAR to the Antarctic Climate Change and the
Environment report has been compiled. This Information Paper
provides the update report as an Attachment.
Background
In 2009, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)
published its landmark report Antarctic Climate Change and the
Environment (ACCE Report) (Turner et al. 2009). On the basis of
the report, the ATCPs convened a Meeting of Experts on Climate
Change. In turn, that meeting resulted in the establishment of a
Climate Change Response Work Programme within the CEP, and
more recently a Subsidiary Group on Climate Change Response with
the mandate to give effect to the priorities identified within the
Work Programme. SCAR published a further update to the ACCE
Report in 2014 (Turner et al. 2014), and has produced annual
synopses of research outcomes for the ATCMs since 2009.
A major update by SCAR to the ACCE report (Chown et al., 2022)
entitled Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment: A Decadal
Synopsis and Recommendations for Action has now been compiled
based largely on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Changeâ€™s Sixth Assessment Reports (IPCC AR6).
A summary of the key findings of the update report and a series of
policy recommendations derived from these findings is provided in
ATCM XLIV Working Paper 30. Recommendations on research
imperatives are provided in ATCM XLIV Working Paper 31.
This Information Paper provides the ACCE update report as a pdf
Attachment.
