Czechia-Turkey Scientific and Logistic Collaboration in Antarctica
Czechia-Turkey Scientific and Logistic Collaboration in Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by Czechia and Turkey
Summary
This paper presents information on the collaboration between
Czechia and Turkey in the sixth Turkish Antarctic Expedition (TAE-
VI).
Czechia -Turkey Collaboration
Mutual collaboration is crucial in Antarctic research as Antarctica is
a continent dedicated to science. Turkey aims to support mutual
progress by signing bilateral agreements with the Antarctic Treaty
Parties in order to highlight the intention to promote global
scientific development. This mutual collaboration between Czechia
and Turkey has been conducted in the context of the Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) Between the Ministry of Industry and
Technology of the Republic of Turkey and the Ministry of
Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic on Scientific
Cooperation in Antarctic Research which was signed in Prague on
July 8, 2019.
During TAE-VI, the importance of cooperation in Antarctica
emerged once again. The parties fulfilled their commitment to
support each other and carried out a joint operation that is worthy
of the solidarity spirit of Antarctica.
Scientific and logistic collaboration was conducted with Czech
scientists during the TAE-VI on the way back from King George
Island to Punta Arenas. Turkey shared available seats on the
chartered flight with Czech Antarctic Research Program.
Conclusion
Scientific and logistic collaboration enhances the statesâ€™
international collaboration and also reduces the carbon footprint in
the Antarctic region. It was a mutual pleasure to work together in
the last season. Czechia and Turkey intends to increase this
collaboration with further available sources in the upcoming years.
