Bulgaria-Turkey Scientific Collaboration
Within the scope of the 30th Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition (30
BAE) and the 6th Turkish Antarctic Expedition (TAE-VI), field
studies of the bilateral research project “Glacier Monitoring and 3D
Modelling in Horseshoe Island Antarctica Based on UAV-GPR
Observations”, between the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute and The
Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)
Marmara Research Center (MAM), Polar Research Institute (PRI),
were conducted in the Horseshoe Island which hosts Turkish
Scientific Research Camp.
The applications were made with joint projects to the bilateral
cooperation project call between TUBITAK and the Bulgarian
Academy of Sciences. The international research project prepared
by Assist. Prof. Dr. Mahmut Oguz Selbesoglu and Assist. Prof. Dr.
Anna Veselinova Lazarova- Georgieva was accepted to be
supported. The depth of glaciers and the topographic structure were
observed by comprehensive data collection methods including UAV
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Photogrammetry and UAV GPR (Ground
Penetrating Radar) technologies within the project.
In addition to the scientific collaboration, logistic capabilities were
shared with Bulgarian scientists within the TAE-VI on the way back
to King George Island and Punta Arenas. This logistical support not
only enhanced the international collaboration but also reduced the
carbon footprint of both states in the Antarctic region. It was a
mutual pleasure to work together during the last season and we
hope that this collaboration will continue in the future years.
