Antarctic Blue Carbon
Antarctic Blue Carbon
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
Resolution 8 (2021) Antarctica in a Changing Climate
recommended that Parties consider, research and communicate the
implications of climate change for Antarctica (including at UNFCCC
COP26), and seek to avoid or mitigate further stresses to Antarctic
terrestrial and marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Blue carbon is
significant in the Southern Ocean’s coastal fjords and continental
shelf where new carbon sinks are emerging and increasing. A new
British Antarctic Survey / WWF project aims to map georeferenced
blue carbon stocks around the Southern Ocean, initially focussing
on West Antarctica.
Introduction
‘Blue carbon’ refers to the carbon stored in coastal and marine
ecosystems. Through photosynthesis, marine ecosystems very
efficiently convert CO2 from the atmosphere and dissolved in water
into the tissues of marine organisms. This is an ecosystem service
(benefit from nature) with considerable climate mitigation
potential. Protecting blue carbon habitats and sinks may be
considered an important strategy in mitigating climate change
globally.
Antarctica does not possess mangrove, seagrass or salt marshes
which are typically considered as blue carbon habitat. However, its
coastline does include many fjords which are ideal blue carbon
habitat, and the continental shelf carbon sinks occupy a vast area of
4.4 million km2. Besides considerable size, polar continental shelves
show many key features for effective carbon sinks including near
intact ecosystems with less direct human impacts and so far seem to
increase in power with climate change intensity (i.e. work as
mitigating ‘negative feedbacks’ on climate change).
New blue carbon sinks are emerging and increasing with changes to
the marine environment around Antarctica, for example through 1)
ice shelf collapses generating new phytoplankton blooms and
benthic assemblages; 2) seasonal sea ice losses leading to a doubling
of growth by underlying benthos over the last 25 years; and 3)
glacier retreat exposing super-productive fjord systems. Hotspots
have been found in terms of habitats (e.g. fjords and moraines) but
also at larger regional scale such as the South Orkney Islands shelf.
A new British Antarctic Survey / WWF project aims to map
georeferenced blue carbon stocks around the Polar Regions, initially
focussing on West Antarctica.
Blue carbon and the climate and nature crises
Intensifying human activities and resource requirement have led to
a rapid, recent and massive increase in greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. This has directly led to warming, ocean acidification,
ice losses, sea level rise, weather and precipitation change, and
many significant knock-on effects all grouped together as ‘climate
change’. In parallel, the same activities have led to widespread and
historically unprecedented nature losses. These crises are linked
because each increases the other; nature is very efficient at CO2
greenhouse gas sequestration and thus climate regulation. Tackling
one without considering the other can be less effective and even
counterproductive; meaningful protection and restoration of
carbon- and species-rich systems is a key part of the solution [1,2].
COP26 and other initiatives have driven a steep rise in societal
interest in valuing and protecting marine nature in order to halt its
decline, help to mitigate climate change and benefit the quality of
human life.
What is polar blue carbon?
Ecosystems along polar coasts are quite different from those at
lower latitudes. In the polar regions there are no mangrove,
seagrasses or salt marsh but there are extensive carbon-rich
ecosystems fuelled by macro- and micro-algae. Per unit area or time
polar blue carbon is thought to be less productive or efficient as a
carbon pathway (and thus climate mitigation) as low latitude
coastal wetlands because of seasonal darkness and very low
temperatures. However, although still little researched to date,
there is strong evidence that polar blue carbon could be important
as a ‘nature-based solution’ to aid climate mitigation. Not least
because one of the most carbon-rich habitats proven to be strong in
sequestration of carbon are fjords, which occur mainly at high
latitudes.
The fate of much of the rich, endemic biodiversity living in polar
fjords is burial in the anoxic muds on the fjord floor [3,4], but there
are much more extensive polar carbon sinks throughout the deep
and sometimes wide continental shelves. Key features for strong
carbon sink and climate mitigation performance in nature are that
ecosystems are 1) intact or near intact; 2) extensive and long term;
and 3) involve conservation that is not too focussed on single goals.
Unlike those at lower latitudes polar continental shelf carbon sinks
meet all these, with a massive 4.4 million km2. They have a
number of advantages over carbon sinks elsewhere. Being far from
urban centres they have fewer other anthropogenic stressors, few
other complicating factors such as non-indigenous species, and
mainly require protection, rather than time, effort and finance
costly restoration or creation. Perhaps most importantly, polar areas
work as the largest negative (mitigating) feedbacks on climate
change – that is they drawdown, store and sequester more carbon
with intensity of climate change [3-6].
How and why is polar blue carbon changing?
Physio-chemical change and biological responses to these around
the Polar Regions are complex in both space and time [7]. Arctic
seas can generate considerable blue carbon but clear climate-driven
change in this remains to be detected [8]. Blue carbon estimation
and quantification in the Southern Ocean has involved investigating
the magnitude and density of organismal carbon storage on the
seabed [3,9], or organic carbon in sediment cores, or both [4].
Increases in blue carbon have been found associated with three
main climate-forced processes:
Ice shelves collapse to generate new phytoplankton blooms and
benthic assemblages [10]. The combination of opening up new bay
scale ecosystems and enrichment in the wake of the giant icebergs
created can amount to a million tonnes for a single giant iceberg
[6].
Seasonal sea ice losses change the timing, duration and cell size of
phytoplankton blooms [7], leading to a doubling of growth by
underlying benthos over the last 25 years [9]. This can be
complicated by carbon losses in some areas caused by a) increased
iceberg scour in the shallows [11]; b) increased seasonal sea ice in
some areas [12]; and c) losses of ice associated zooplankton
biomass [13].
glacier retreat along fjords exposes potential new productive habitat
for phytoplankton at the surface, macro-algae in the shallows and
rich biodiversity on the seabed [3,4]. This is the most important of
the three processes per unit area, but occupies by far the least area.
Where are the hotspots of polar blue carbon?
Blue carbon magnitude has been little mapped in either Polar
Region to date, though there is a considerable literature on
georeferenced biomass and carbon content of sediment cores. A new
British Antarctic Survey / WWF project will map existing
information from July 2022 onwards. Despite being relatively
young, fjords are likely to be hotspots [4]. Beyond the habitat scale
the South Orkney Islands shelf (44,000 km2) appears to be a
regional hotspot, overlapping with a CCAMLR Marine Protected
Area. The size, distribution and export of macro algal forests will
be a key area to look at in forthcoming blue carbon hotspot
mapping. One of the key challenges of such mapping will be issues
of spatial scale and interpolation and scaling up in a very data-poor
region of complex change.
Is polar blue carbon vulnerable?
Polar biota is slow growing, sensitive to change and highly
vulnerable, and faces a complex diversity of stressors as well as
climate change so disruption to growing carbon sinks could be
significant. Polar continental shelves offer a rare opportunity for
reducing nature loss and aiding efficient climate mitigation by
protection of growing blue carbon sinks (rather than expensive and
less effective, restoration and creation of habitat).
To date, no areas have been protected under the Antarctic Treaty
System specifically for their blue carbon value. However, as new
embayments, fjords and other areas open up with marine ice losses,
productivity is likely to considerably increase [4,6,7,9,10] and such
areas may be subject to human activities, such as fishing, tourism or
new infrastructure.
