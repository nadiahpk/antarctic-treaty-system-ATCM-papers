A Five-Year Overview and 2021–22 Season Report on IAATO
Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM
Visitor Site Guidelines
Information Paper submitted by IAATO
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM
information on IAATO Operator Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines use. This information paper presents data collected by
IAATO from IAATO Operator Post Visit Report Forms for the
Antarctic Peninsula during the 2021–22 season. No non-IAATO
member visits are included in this analysis.
In addition to our annual data sets, building on discussions with
different Antarctic Treaty Parties around growth, we have included
some historical data which may aid in future discussions around site
usage.
It is important to note, due to the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19)
pandemic, IAATO Operator expeditions during the 2020–21 season
were limited to two individual expeditions on the Antarctic
Peninsula. For this reason, data sets from the 2020-21 season have
been excluded to provide a more representative overview of the
statistics. The 2021-22 season was also truncated due to COVID-19.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found
in ATCM XLIV_IP42 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: A
Historical Review of Growth, the 2021–22 Season, and Preliminary
Estimates for 2022–23, and on the IAATO website https://
iaato.org/information-resources/data-statistics/.
Historic Overview of Antarctic Peninsula Traditional Seaborne
Tourism
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional
commercial seaborne LAS Vessel) tourism in the Antarctic
Peninsula, which accounts for over 95% of all landed activity.
A SOLAS vessel (as defined in Maritime Rule Part 21) is any ship to
which the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea
1974 applies; namely: a passenger ship engaged on an international
voyage, or a non-passenger ship of 500 tons gross tonnage or more
engaged on an international voyage. Yacht (vessels carrying 12
passengers or less) numbers are only included where specifically
mentioned.
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different
aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages,
landings made and sites used).
Figure 1: Factor Change in Traditional Landing Ship-borne Tourism
in the Antarctic Peninsula 1989–2021.
IAATO Operator expeditions during the 2020–21 season were
limited to two individual expeditions, and 15 clients on the
Antarctic Peninsula. For this reason, data sets from the 2020-21
season have been excluded to provide a more representative
overview of the statistics.
During the 2021-22 season all traditional commercial seaborne
tourism with landings around the Peninsula was conducted by
IAATO Operators. Table 1 provides a detailed summary of number
of passengers, voyages, landings, sites and vessels over the past five
seasons shows the industry growth over the period 2016–2021, and
potential number of passengers and voyages for 2022–23.

voyages, landings, sites and SOLAS vessels on the Antarctic
Peninsula for the past five years, 2016–2021, and potential number
of passengers and voyages for 2022–23. Passenger data presented in
Table 1 includes IAATO operated Yachts.

Since the IMO’s
International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code)
was adopted, there has been substantial investment by operators in
existing and new build vessels. The 2019–20 season saw the first
new SOLAS vessels launched after the Polar Code came into force in
January 2017
Some new vessels scheduled for the 2021–22 season were delayed
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and some Operators did not
operate all their vessels.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic some Operators took the difficult
decision not to operate for the 2021-22 season early on and when
Omicron became prevalent, others chose to cancel voyages or
curtail their season.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, all vessels were benefiting from
the world’s economic strength and operating at near-full passenger
capacity.
Operators saw fewer clients willing to travel during the 2021–22
season due to COVID-19 and therefore had lower occupancy.
As new vessels are introduced into the IAATO fleet, the average
passenger capacity per vessel has increased, with many of the
Category 1 vessels being added now carrying up to 200 passengers.
Analysis of site use and activities (found in ATCM XLIV_IP42 IAATO
Overview of Antarctic Tourism: A Historical Review of Growth, the
2021–22 Season, and Preliminary Estimates for 2022–23) has
shown Operators are responding to IAATO’s multi layered strategy
to encourage them to spread activities across a range of platforms:
ship cruising; Zodiac cruising; kayaking; etc., in order to reduce
activities at landing sites. IAATO has encouraged this practice since
2012 and strengthened it during our 2019 Annual Meeting by
incorporating into our Bylaws a new Code of Conduct for Vessels.
Specific Landing Site Use for the 2021-22 season
The top five visited sites for the 2021-22 season were Cuverville
Island, Neko Harbour, Whalers Bay, Danco Island and Halfmoon
Island - Chinstrap Colony. These sites account for approximately
26% of all landings made during the season. The top twenty most-
visited sites accounted for approximately 64% of all landings.
Appendix II lists the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made
from 2016–2022
Figure 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all
sites within the Antarctic Peninsula over a five year period (2016–
2021). During the 2021-22 season, landings occurred over a period
of approximately 188 days from November to April. The 2020-21
season has been excluded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Figure 2: Cumulative number of landings made per day at all sites
within the Antarctic Peninsula 2016–2021.
There is variation in levels of activity. These peaks and troughs are
remarkably similar from season to season, and demonstrate the
fluctuations in levels of visitation, resulting from schedules for
expeditions revolving around holiday season timetables.

Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines
Appendix III provides a five-year analysis (2016-2022) of active
seasons (2020-2021 excluded) of the total number of known
landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines. An
assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines was conducted through an analysis of the ATCM Post
Visit Report Forms for traditional commercial ship-borne and yacht
tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula.
Conclusion
The information extracted from these ATCM Post Visit Report forms
for traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic
Peninsula shows that while overall tourism levels continued to rise
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase is not uniform across
all visitor sites as demonstrated in Appendix II. A few sites continue
to prove very popular with a greater increase in activity, while
some other sites saw a decrease in activity. The pattern of
concentrated increase is believed to be partially explained by the
popularity of these sites for their reliable access, ease of visitor
management, and aesthetic value and historic interest. Additionally,
factors such as ice patterns and weather strongly contribute to site
selection and visitation patterns by either allowing or restricting
access.
All of the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by
ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Antarctic
Program Management guidelines.
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP
and ATCM on its Operators’ activities. In addition, IAATO Operators
remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of
ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
