Antarctic tourism policies after the “pandemic pause”
Antarctic tourism policies after the “pandemic pause”
Information Paper submitted by ASOC
Summary
The pause in Antarctic tourism caused by the pandemic is easing
and recovery will be a matter of time (barring other global
disruptions). Given that tourism is a highly dynamic activity, ASOC
suggests that the ATCM should be proactive in identifying emerging
tourism trends and shaping tourism management for the next
decade. ASOC considers that it would be more fruitful if the ATCM
focused on identifying concrete ways to anticipate and manage
tourism pressure. This document examines potential Antarctic
tourism developments following the coronavirus pandemic. Key
actions for the ATCM include:
Expanding area protection under Annex V;
Developing dedicated programs for monitoring of tourism impacts;
Ensuring consistent assessment of tourism activities;
Evaluating the effectiveness of existing tourism regulation; and
Encouraging low impact modalities of tourism.
Introduction
Over the last three decades, tourism has been one of the most
discussed topics at the ATCM, including through numerous
Intersessional Contact Groups (ICGs). However, many of these
discussions have not resulted in significant policy action. ASOC has
concluded that tourism requires instead pragmatic approaches
(ASOC, 2019). In parallel, the seasons prior to the pandemic
reached record levels of Antarctic visitors. Pre-pandemic trends
pointed towards a quite significant growth of polar tourism in a few
years hence, putting stress on the existing regulatory system for
Antarctic tourism (ASOC, 2018). At the start of the 2019-2020
season, it was apparent that continued growth of Antarctic tourism
could potentially lead to instances of “overtourism” – or rather its
Antarctic equivalent – at some times and places (Roura, 2019).
Then COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. The year 2020 has
been described as the “worst year on tourism history” for global
tourism (UNWTO, 2021a). In January 2021, the UNWTO noted
“Global tourism suffered its worst year on record in 2020, with
international arrivals dropping by 74%... This compares with the
4% decline recorded during the 2009 global economic crisis.”
(UNWTO, 2021a). In Antarctica, the greatest effects were felt in the
2020-2021 season where there was practically no tourism (IAATO,
2021). The timing of Antarctic tourism recovery is unknown but it
is apparent that the “pandemic pause” is easing and that tourism in
the region will eventually rebound, barring the emergence of other
global disruptions. In a World Tourism Organization expert survey
on global tourism recovery (excluding Antarctica), 45 percent of
those polled projected that international tourism will recover to
2019 levels in 2024 or later, while 43 percent predicted a recovery
in 2023 (UNWTO, 2021b). Given that tourism is a highly dynamic
activity, the ATCM should be proactive in identifying emerging
tourism trends and shaping tourism management for the next
decade as activities in Antarctica resume. To what extent is this
happening?
Some recent developments
Based on pre-pandemic trends, the two main vectors of Antarctic
tourism recovery will more likely involve the resumption of
“traditional” shipborne tourism, primarily focused in the Antarctic
Peninsula area; and tourism in the Antarctic interior, which is air
supported, land-
based, and spread out over a large area. These activities target
different but partly overlapping market segments and develop
following different patterns.
Examples of recent developments that may anticipate future trends
include:
One of several forthcoming purpose-built luxury expedition ships
was launched in 2020, and after sea tests it began operating in the
Arctic in 2021. A hybrid-electric Polar Class 2 ice breaker, she
reached the North Pole on 6 September 2021 (Nielsen, 2021).
Nuclear-powered icebreakers have transported passengers on
voyages from Murmansk to the North Pole every summer since the
early 1990s (Nilsen, 2021).
The first landing of an Airbus A340 took place in the polar plateau,
about a five-hour flight south from Cape Town, in 2 November
2021 (Cormack, 2022).
The first Antarctic tennis cruise has been announced for 2022-2023.
It involves two tennis celebrities playing a show match in
Antarctica in a high-end cruise that follows an otherwise standard
itinerary. The higher-level cabins and packages enable greater
access to the tennis celebrities through during “…private lunches,
dinners, zodiac rides or cocktail parties, while guests of the top
three suites will even get the chance to face the brothers on the
court during a five-minute doubles rally” (Gross, 2021).
Citizen science activities focusing on opportunistic data collection
from cruise ships are becoming more common. Citizen science is
not a substitute for“big science” or a justification to expand
tourism, but may provide useful complementary data for Antarctic
ecosystem protection (e.g. Johannessen et al, 2021).
These examples illustrate that the possibilities for expanding polar
tourism and creating new tourism activities and packages are
endless, particularly at the higher end of the market.
Some significant discussions have taken place intersessionally,
building from the 2018 Rotterdam Antarctic Tourism workshop.
Intersessional discussion on permanent tourism and non-
governmental activities facilities post ATCM XLIII resulted in an
inspiring exchange of ideas (Netherlands, 2022). Based on the
performance of earlier ICGs on tourism (ASOC, 2019) it remains to
be seen if the discussion will result in a breakthrough (a new
perspective of examining land-based facilities associated with or
used to support tourism) or avoid the central issue by excluding
some current forms of land-based tourism or tourism support from
closer scrutiny.
Relevant research initiatives underway include the Strategic
Conservation Planning process led by SCAR and IAATO; and some
international research programs focussing relevant to the
management of tourism. These include SCAR’s Integrated Science to
Inform Antarctic and Southern Ocean Conservation (ANT-Icon);
SCAR, IAATO and partners’ Systematic Conservation Plan for the
Antarctic Peninsula; and two research programs funded by the
Dutch Research Council (NWO): the recently started Proactive
Management of Antarctic Tourism: Exploring the Role of ATS
Principles and Values and Best Practices Beyond the ATS (Pro-Act);
and Polar Tourism - Research Programme on Assessment of Impacts
and Responses (PT-REPAIR) (under development). ASOC welcomes
current initiatives aiming at the conceptual and practical
implementation of tourism monitoring (Ecuador, Spain and the
United States, 2022; Germany, 2022).
Key actions for the ATCM
In recent years ASOC has recommended several key actions for the
ATCM (ASOC 2018, 2019, 2021), with an emphasis on pragmatic,
tangible actions. Most of these recommendations are still valid
today. Key actions for the ATCM include:
Expanding area protection under Annex V;
Developing dedicated programs for monitoring of tourism impacts;
Ensuring consistent assessment of tourism activities;
Evaluating the effectiveness of existing tourism regulation; and
Encouraging low impact modalities of tourism.
Some recent and ongoing initiatives or proposals currently under
discussion are broadly compatible with several of these proposed
actions. ASOC looks forward to seeing how these and other policies
unfold in the near future as post-pandemic Antarctic tourism
resumes.
