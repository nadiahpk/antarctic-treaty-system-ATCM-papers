Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in
2021-22
Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in
2021-22
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina,
Chile, United States and the International Association of Antarctica
Tour Operators (IAATO)
Summary
Since 2010, the United Kingdom and IAATO have provided reports
to the ATCM about the number of yachts sighted in the Antarctic
during each previous season, while Argentina has provided reports
detailing yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia. From 2016
Chile, Argentina, the United Kingdom and IAATO have presented a
joint paper (ATCM XXXIX/WP34, ATCM XL/WP19, ATCM XLI/
IP55, ATCM XLII/IP107 and ATCM XLIII/IP054).
This paper consolidates information from the United Kingdom,
Argentina, Chile, United States and IAATO relating to yachts
sighted in Antarctica, or indicating an intention to travel to
Antarctica, during the 2021-22 season.
Background
The ATCM has previously welcomed information about yachts
sighted in, or planning to travel to, Antarctica. This has enabled
Parties to consider the overall volume of yachts known to be
visiting the continent, and to confirm whether appropriate
authorisations for such activities had been obtained.
As in previous years, this paper includes information collected as
part of a wider visitor monitoring programme (for all visitors and
vessels) at the UK-operated base Port Lockroy; information from
Argentina on yachts travelling to Antarctica from Ushuaia (Brown
Base remained closed for the 2021/2022 season); information
provided by Chile based on details recorded from yachts indicating
an intention to travel from Puerto Williams/Punta Arenas to
Antarctica; and incidental sightings recorded by IAATO members
and other vessels in Antarctica. This year the paper also includes
information from the United States on yachts observed from Palmer
Station. It would be helpful if Parties could provide any
supplementary material, which adds to or verifies this information.
A total of 42 yachts were sighted in, or reported an intention to sail
to, Antarctica during the 2021-22 season. This represented an
increase from the 8 reported in 2020-21 (a season that was
significantly affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, with travel
restrictions and quarantine requirements reducing the number of
yachts travelling to Antarctica). 16 of these were IAATO members
(table 1); 18 were non-IAATO members but had Party authorisation
to travel to Antarctica (table 2); and 8 vessels appear to the
cosponsors to be unauthorised vessels (table 3).
Parties are reminded that the EIES contains a summarised reporting
tool, which can generate a complete list of all vessels included in
pre-season information as having obtained authorisation to operate
in Antarctica (https://www.ats.aq/devAS/InformationExchange/
SummarizedReports?lang=e). This facility makes it much easier to
determine whether a yacht is authorised, and consequently, this
may be a useful tool for use in-season to expedite the verification of
the authorisation status of any sighted yachts. Parties are therefore
requested to ensure that the EIES is updated regularly to include all
authorised tourism vessels.
Whilst the attached list is not exhaustive, the United Kingdom,
Argentina, Chile, United States and IAATO believe that it is
important that the ATCM continues to monitor the level of yachting
activities in Antarctica and encourages Parties to share information
about yachts they have authorised through the EIES Pre-Season
Information facility and via the post-visit site reports, in line with
Resolution 10 (2021). We would also point to the continued activity
of yachts that have been operating in the region without
authorisation from a Treaty Party. We urge the ATCM to consider
further the matter of unauthorised yachts.
