Background
In 2017, the United Nations proclaimed a Decade of Ocean Science
for Sustainable Development (hereafter referred to as the UN Ocean
Decade) from 2021 until 2030 to support efforts to reverse the cycle
of decline in ocean health. To achieve this ambitious goal, this
initiative aims to gather ocean stakeholders worldwide behind a
common framework that will ensure ocean science can fully support
countries in creating improved conditions for sustainable
development of the world’s oceans. The initiative strives to
strengthen the international cooperation needed to develop the
scientific research and innovative technologies that can connect
ocean science with the needs of society at the global scale.
The need for a Southern Ocean Action Plan
In the Southern Ocean, human presence, and the combined effects
of various forms of pollution, transport, infrastructure, and the use
of living resources, together with accelerated climate change at
high latitudes, are exerting increasing pressures on the
environment. These changes have the potential to alter the role of
the Antarctic and Southern Ocean in regulating global climate and
other systems, as well as impacting a host of other important
ecosystem services. Being well adapted to stable environmental
conditions, with unique traits, Antarctic species are considered
more vulnerable to environmental perturbations and pollutants,
compared to species from more northerly latitudes.
Since the Southern Ocean community of stakeholders is globally
unique in its operation within the Antarctic Treaty System, which is
based entirely on scientific understanding and environmental
protection, it is imperative to strengthen international
collaborations to increase scientific understanding of the Antarctic
region. Underlying the UN Ocean Decade is the need for data
management to be aligned with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) principles to achieve the ambitious data
objectives of the UN Ocean Decade.
The UN Ocean Decade Societal Outcomes align strongly with the
remit of the Antarctic Treaty and its Committee for Environmental
Protection. The Southern Ocean community therefore recognises the
need to develop and implement a coordinated, international plan
that builds on our existing understanding of how human interaction
with the Southern Ocean can benefit people and societies in ways
that will also contribute to the protection and conservation of the
unique characteristics of these regions.
The Southern Ocean Action Plan will, as part of the UN Ocean
Decade, deliver in achieving the UN Agenda 2030 and its
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a polar context.
The Southern Ocean Action Plan process
Based on the recommendations in the Implementation Plan of the
United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable
Development (Version 2.0, July 2021), the Southern Ocean
community engaged in a stakeholder-oriented process to develop
the Southern Ocean Action Plan. This process engaged a broad
community, which includes the scientific research community, the
business and industry sector, and national and international
management bodies. This inclusive approach is a key pillar of the
Southern Ocean contribution to the UN Ocean Decade and will be
prioritised throughout its implementation.
As part of this global effort, the Southern Ocean Task Force
(coordinated by SCAR, and including the SCAR Antarctic
Biodiversity Portal, SOOS, ICED, SCOR, EPB, IODE, IAATO,
CLIVAR, WCRP, SORP, NIOZ, PewTrusts, WWF, RBINS and BELSPO

Climate and Ecosystem Dynamics in the Southern Ocean

Sciences; BELSPO – Belgian Federal Science Policy Office.)
identified the needs of the Southern Ocean community to address
the challenges related to the unique environmental characteristics
and governance structure of the Southern Ocean. Through this
community-driven process, we identified synergies within the
Southern Ocean community and beyond in order to elaborate an
Action Plan that provides a framework for Southern Ocean
stakeholders to formulate and develop tangible actions and
deliverables that support the UN Ocean Decade vision.
The Southern Ocean process sheds light on the cross-cutting nature
of constraints affecting the management of, and activities within,
the Southern Ocean, and the resulting mismatch between the needs
of society and research interests and outputs. These include the
need for (i) more and better-coordinated research facilities, (ii)
increased access to data, infrastructure and resources, and (iii)
improved efficiency of mechanisms for collaborations between
different sectors (academia, government, industry, etc.)
The way forward
Through the publication of the Southern Ocean Action Plan in April
2022, the Southern Ocean Task Force aims to mobilise the Southern
Ocean community and inspire all stakeholders to seek engagement
and leverage opportunities to deliver innovative solutions that
maintain and foster the unique conditions of the Southern Ocean.
This framework provides an initial roadmap to strengthen links
between science, industry and policy, as well as to encourage
internationally collaborative activities in order to address existing
gaps in our knowledge and data coverage.
