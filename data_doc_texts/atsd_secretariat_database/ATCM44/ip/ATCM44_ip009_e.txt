Report of a new non-native insect (moth fly) on King George Island,
South Shetland Islands
Report of a new non-native insect (moth fly) on King George Island,
South Shetland Islands
Information Paper submitted by Chile and the Republic of Korea
Summary
A new non-native insect, the moth fly, Psychoda albipennis
(Diptera: Psychodidae), was found inside the sewage treatment
buildings at two research bases (Frei Base and King Sejong Station)
on King George Island in 2019/2020 and 2021/22 season,
respectively. To avoid further spread of the moth fly, it is urgently
required that all Parties operating their Antarctic programmes on
the island should check their facilities whether they are infested
with the non-native fly, P. albipennis. Each Party is strongly
encouraged to conduct monitoring of the moth fly in its facility and
remove the new non-native species if found, before it further
disperses within the island like the case of the non-native winter
crane fly (Trichocera maculipennis).
Background
In the context of recent global climate change, Antarctic ecosystems
are faced with continuous threats of the invasion of non-native
species as well as unwanted impacts of the species that have already
become invasive (Frenot et al. 2005; Chown et al. 2012; Hughes et
al. 2019, 2020; Chwedorzewska et al. 2020; Bertlett et al 2021).
Currently, the drivers of biological invasion have been related to
increasing human activities such as scientific programmes and
tourism in Antarctica (McGeoch et al. 2015). In this context, there
are some detailed investigations indicating that the pathways of
unintentional introduction of alien invertebrates is related to the
national Antarctic programmes (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013;
Houghton et al. 2016). The substantial number of inadvertent
introductions are insects, many of which have established
successfully in their invasive habitats, giving subsequent impacts on
the Antarctic biota (Chown and Convey 2016). Approximately 200
species, comprising one-third of known non-native species
established in Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands, are insects
(Frenot et al. 2005; Chown and Convey 2016). Currently, a winged
winter crane fly, Trichocera maculipennis (Diptera: Trichoceridae)
has established in synanthropic habitats, and most likely in natural
environments in King George Island as well. The winter crane fly,
known as a holarctic species, has a very broad native range that is
comprised of Europe, North America, and Asia including India,
covering from temperate to Arctic regions (Dahl 1970; Petrašiūnas
and Podenas 2017; Potocka and Krzmińska 2018).
Since 2007, there have been reports of infestations of the non-
native winter crane fly, T. maculipennis, in and around the sewage
treatment facilities of at least six Antarctic stations in Maxwell Bay
and one in Admiralty Bay. Some infested stations (Uruguay,
Republic of Korea, and Poland) have attempted separately to
eradicate the winter crane fly from their facilities (Volonterio et al.
2013; León et al. 2021; ATCM XLIII–IP88). To achieve more
effective monitoring and control of the non-native winter crane fly,
most of the parties to the Antarctic Treaty operating research bases
in the island have been participating in a joint programme,
collaborating on efforts to find out suitable management measures
of this species (ATCM XLI – IP 50; ATCM XLII – IP120; ATCM XLIII
–IP35, IP88). Nevertheless, effective control measure and
eradication tactics that can be applied across different stations have
yet to be developed against the non-native fly, although the efforts
to stop their dispersal and inter-station movements have been made
over the last years. Meanwhile, we found a new non-native insect at
two research bases in the island and would like to inform CEP
members our observations to prevent its further expansion.
Non-native insect detection and identification
During a routine inspection of UV traps in December 2019 as a joint
effort to monitor the non-native winter crane fly, the presence of
several small live insects was discovered inside a sewage treatment
building at the Chilean Frei Base in King George Island. The insects
were then tentatively identified as a moth fly (Figure 1). The
presence of the moth fly in the building was further confirmed in
two more visits during December 2019-January 2020. We identified
the moth fly through DNA barcoding (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I (COI) gene sequences of mitochondrial DNA) at Korea
Polar Research Institute in 2021, confirming that the moth fly is
Psychoda albipennis (Diptera: Psyschodidae) with 100% similarity
to its northern American population and that of Kerguelen Islands
on the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system (https://
www.boldsystems.org/). The moth fly, P. albipennis, is known as a
cosmopolitan species, and adult flies are often seen in various
places with high moisture, including bathrooms and toilets. Moth
fly larvae usually occur in aquatic habitats. Although moth flies do
not bite, their larvae can be a serious health problem, causing
human urinary myiasis (Shimpi et al. 2018). During the 2021/2022
season, a small number of the moth fly adults was additionally
found at the sewage treatment facility in King Sejong Station.
Response and monitoring
The moth fly adults discovered in King Sejong Station were fewer
than ten in total, when observed over a period of a month between
December 2021 and February 2022. Monitoring and removal of the
moth fly adults are currently being conducted by routine visual
inspection and with UV traps which have been used for the
monitoring of the winter crane fly, T. maculipennis. We now have a
plan to investigate whether whole life cycle of the moth fly is
successfully completed in the facilities of two research bases during
2022/23 season. A female moth fly disposing eggs was collected in
Frei base in 2019/20 season although it was unclear if the moth
flies could lay viable eggs in these facilities (see Figure 1B).
Conclusions
Currently, the non-native moth flies have been found only in
synanthropic habitats in King George Island. Although their
reproduction and other biology in the stations’ facilities is yet
unknown, their successful reproduction in the station appears
highly likely, considering their occurrence, biology and habitat
preference. The larvae of moth flies (genus Psychoda) have been
found together with those of T. maculipennis in synanthropic
habitats (Karandikar 1931). To avoid further spread of the moth fly
in King George Island, it is urgently required that all Parties
operating their Antarctic programmes on the island check if their
facilities are infested with any moth flies. Otherwise, the moth fly
may be introduced unintentionally into other research bases and
establish its populations there as T. maculipennis did. Unlike the
winter crane fly, moth flies can have multiple generations a year
since they can complete a life cycle in a short period of time, which
is a serious concern in their invasive habitat as a large population
can easily build up. Therefore, we encourage the Parties to
undertake periodic monitoring outside and inside of their facilities
and supply chains, at the moment sending cargo to Antarctica and
while it is moved into other places, and to consider co-ordinated
responses against the new non-native moth fly as well as the other
non-native fly, winter crane fly (T. maculipennis).
