Switzerland’s contribution to snow research in Antarctica

Information Paper submitted by Switzerland
Summary
This paper summarizes the past decade of research activities
concerning snow and firn in Antarctica at different host stations
conducted by scientists in Switzerland.
Background
Snow and firn are understudied key components of the recent
geology and atmosphere of Antarctica. In close collaboration with
different national research institutes and agencies, the expertise in
snow and firn research within Switzerland's research institutes
could be exploited.
Introduction
The WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research and the
Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences at EPFL conducted several
measurement campaigns in collaboration with different nations and
institutes. The main goal of this research was to improve the
interaction between precipitation, sublimation and snowdrift, and
the microstructural properties of the snow and firn pack. The
following institutes and organizations allowed conducting these
joint expeditions:
LGGE-CNRS Grenoble, France (now IGE-CNRS Grenoble)
National Institute for Polar Research (NIPR), Japan
Australian Antarctic Service (AAS)
French Polar Institute Paul-Émile Victor
Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine
Research
US Antarctic Program (NSF)
International Polar Foundation
We thank all these institutions for their support in logistics and help
at the stations.
Summary of expeditions and publications
The "Allan Hill blue ice as analog of Snowball Earth" expedition, led
by S. Warren, could be joined by M. Schneebeli (WSL). This resulted
in the first detailed imaging of blue ice and allowed improved
modelling of the albedo (Dadic et al, 2013, Dadic et al, 2015). The
expedition was part of the US. Antarctic Program.
The main goal of the EXPLORE expedition led by chief scientist J.
Chappellaz (IGE) in 2011-2012 was to investigate the snow and firn
conditions around and in between the Russian station Vostok and
the French-Italian station Concordia in view of the “oldest ice
project”. Due to logistical difficulties, only a two-day intense snow
measurement session could be conducted on the traverse between
Vostok and Concordia at Point Barnola. The results of these
measurements are published in Calonne et al, 2017.
One researcher from WSL-SLF could join the CoFi-expedition led by
the chief scientist S. Kipfstuhl (AWI) in 2012-2013. The goal of the
snow research at Kohnen station was to investigate the micro- and
macrostructual properties of a low accumulation snowpack in
comparison to Point Barnola. Several new instruments could be
tested in an Antarctic environment (Proksch et al, 2015).
Drifting and blowing snow and sublimation are dominant ablation
processes in the polar regions. It is crucially important to quantify
their contribution to the mass balance of our ice sheets. Their
quantification also helps in assessing precipitation and sea level
changes as climate warms. In this context, members of the CRYOS
lab at EPFL and the research unit Snow and Atmosphere at WSL/
SLF have installed three automatic weather stations, which have
specifically been designed to not only measure meteorological
parameters, surface energy balance and snow depth but as well
drifting snow with a Japanese snow particle counter (SPC). Two
such stations have been installed in the vicinity of the Princess
Elisabeth Station run by the International Polar Foundation (IPF)
starting with a first expedition in 2016/17 (M. Lehning; N. Wever).
These stations have in the following years been serviced and
extended by H. Huwald, N. Wever and A. Sigmund. In 2018,
additional such stations have been established in the vicinity of the
Japanese Syowa station (specifically at S17) and at the Australian
Davis station. The data from the stations are used in model
validation (Sharma et al., 2022) and to understand surface mass
exchange under blowing snow (Sigmund et al., 2021).
With participation in overall three Antarctic cruises (Sipex - E.
Trujillo, AntEx - N. Wever, K. Leonard, ACE - I. Gorodetskaya), the
CRYOS lab has also gathered data on snow distribution on sea ice
(Trujillo et al., 2016), which allow improved modelling of sea ice
dynamics and mass balance (Wever et al., 2020) and of snow on sea
ice (Jafari et al., 2020).
Within the framework of the IPEV project NIVO, the project
partners (Ghislain Picard (PI, IGE, Grenoble), Amaelle Landais
(LSCE, Paris), Henning Löwe (WSL-SLF, Davos)) investigate the
imprint of near-surface snow processes in the creation of climate
signals in low-accumulation areas at the French-Italian Concordia
Station. In 2018 a WSL-SLF researcher participated in the Antarctic
summer field season on Dome C for deploying a metamorphism
experiment and conducting other operational measurements for the
project. The preliminary results (Löwe et al, 2018) suggested an
iteration of the experiment which is approved within the third
funding period NIVO3 (2021-2025) and scheduled for the field
season 2023/2024.
