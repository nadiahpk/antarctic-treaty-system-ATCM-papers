Summary
This document reports on the recent update of the "Plan Estratégico
de Turismo Sustentable de la Provincia de Tierra del Fuego"
("Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism of the Province of Tierra
del Fuego"), of the Fuegian Institute of Tourism (INFUETUR), under
the authority of the government of the Province of Tierra del Fuego,
carried out with the participation of the national and provincial
public sectors and the private sector, to work on developing tourism
in the province. The plan included issues related to the role of
Ushuaia as the gateway city to Antarctica and the main port of
support for Antarctic cruise ship tourism activity. The document is
an invitation to the Meeting, extended particularly to the countries
with gateway cities to Antarctica, to consider its content, with a
view to integrating possible joint actions framed in strategic plans
for the development of Antarctic tourism such as that presented
here.
Background
In December 2010, the INFUETUR, approved the "Plan Estratégico
de Turismo Sustentable de la Provincia de Tierra del Fuego (PETS-
TDF) - Itinerario 2020" ("Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism of
the Province of Tierra del Fuego” (PETS-TDF) - 2020 Itinerary).
During its preparation, INFUETUR relied on the work of a group of
external (local) consultants, with the support and assistance of
internal consultants from the Institute, and with significant
participation from the stakeholders in tourism and the community
of the entire province.
The general objective of the PETS is for tourist activity to develop
sustainably, contributing to improving the quality of life of the local
population, providing higher quality to the travel experience for
visitors, maintaining the balance of the environment, thus obtaining
greater levels of economic profitability of the tourist activity for the
benefit of the local population.
In 2021, the PETS 2025 update was initiated, applying a new
planning and management model appropriate to the current post-
pandemic scenario and the evolution of tourism as an economic
sector.
Development of the update
The PETS TDF 2025 was developed following a work dynamic that
included survey stages, interviews and workshops during August
and October 2021 with the public and private sectors of Ushuaia,
Puerto Almanza / Punta Paraná, Tolhuin and Río Grande, as well as
with key stakeholders related to Antarctic tourism, both nationally
and provincially.
The updating of the PETS represents the strategy for the tourism
development of Tierra del Fuego for the next four years, considering
production of the Plan to be the beginning of the planning
sequence. For this reason, the new PETS incorporates a
management and monitoring system for its annual operating plan as
an organisational tool.
Accordingly, it was prepared with the support of the Federal
Investment Council (CFI), by a team of external consultants, the
technical departments of the Institute and the participation of the
stakeholders directly and indirectly related to the tourist activity.
The aforementioned Plan contains the vision, general objective,
specific objectives, strategic areas, programmes, projects and
actions to be carried out by the Fuegian Institute of Tourism for the
next four years, indicating the direction towards which efforts
should be directed and setting the horizon to be reached, using
tourism as the means and management as the process.
In order to contribute to the fulfilment of the provincial strategy,
each PETS project linked to tourism management in Tierra del
Fuego was analysed in light of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).
Over the last few decades, cruise ship activity has positioned itself
worldwide as an outstanding tourism segment, presenting a
sustained growth rate and significant dynamism. Many of the
tourists who visit the city of Ushuaia arrive by sea, so the cruise
ship segment is of great importance for the destination, as it
represents a significant percentage of tourist and visitor arrivals
during the summer season.
Due to this, to the importance of the City as a gateway to
Antarctica, and because the aim was to strengthen the axes linked
to Antarctic tourism, with regard to the previous Plan, three
technical round tables linked to the Antarctic region were held: one
with stakeholders of provincial bodies in Ushuaia; another in
Buenos Aires with participants from national organisations and,
virtually, with the attendance of organisations from the province,
plus a final technical round table for both provincial and national
organisations, also held virtually.
To update the PETS, a participatory approach was followed from
the diagnosis to the drafting, in order to listen to all the needs and
interests of the stakeholders that make up the province's tourism
sector, including providers, municipal and provincial officials,
academics and even national organisations linked to the
management of Antarctic tourism.
In order to strengthen the city of Ushuaia’s links and proximity to
the Antarctic continent, in its Antarctic section, the Plan is aimed
at:
Highlighting Argentina’s 118-year presence in Antarctica, through
interpretive and thematic tourist routes;
Continuing the development of operational and logistics services in
the port of Ushuaia;
Strengthening the training of local human resources, highlighting
enrolment in the courses available in the Master's Degree in
Antarctic Studies of the National University of Tierra del Fuego
(UNTDF), which provides up-to-date training in historical, political,
environmental, scientific-educational and logistical aspects of the
Antarctic problem, including the creation of new opportunities for
the innovation and development of public and private projects
linked to the subject.

Conclusions
This Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism of Tierra del Fuego
2025 presents Tierra del Fuego as a province with a potential for
environmental and cultural integration, giving each of its regions an
identity, embracing the differences that complement it as a
destination, so that tourist activity can contribute to development
that benefits Fuegian society to strengthen "the End of the World" as
a brand that includes the entire province.
To this end, it was essential to organise the actions so that tourist
activity could develop sustainably, contributing to improving the
quality of life of the local population, promoting inclusion,
providing
higher quality to the travel experience for visitors to the province’s
different regions, and for those who continue their journey to
Antarctica, maintaining the balance of the environment and
obtaining higher levels of economic profitability from tourism
activity for the benefit of the local population.
Argentina invites the Parties, especially those with gateway cities to
Antarctica, to consider the content of this document, with a view to
integrating possible joint actions framed in strategic plans, such as
that described here, for the development of Antarctic tourism.
