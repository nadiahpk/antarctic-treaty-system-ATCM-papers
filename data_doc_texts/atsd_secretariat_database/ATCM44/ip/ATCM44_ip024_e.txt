Ship traffic connects Antarctica to worldwide locations, with
implications for non-native marine species introduction risk
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom presents the results of a quantitative analysis
of ship movements into Antarctic waters, and a spatially-explicit
assessment of introduction risk for non-native marine species in all
Antarctic waters by fishing, tourism and national Antarctic operator
vessels.
Background
Antarctic environments are increasingly at risk from a variety of
impacts from human activities, including the introduction of non-
native species (see: ATCM XXXV WP5; ATCM XLII IP27; ATCM XLII
IP32). However, relatively little detail is known about the risk of
introducing non-native species to the marine environment across all
industries and activities (see ATCM XXXV WP5 and ATCM XLIII
IP6). 
The potential risks of marine non-native species were highlighted at
the CEP Non-native Species Workshop in Christchurch in 2006 (see
ATCM XXIX WP 13) and Practical Guidelines for Ballast Water
Exchange in the Antarctic Treaty area were agreed through
Resolution 3 (2006).  The CEP has repeatedly recognised the
importance of receiving up-to-date scientific knowledge to evaluate
the threat to Antarctic marine ecosystems from marine non-native
species introduction, for example:
The Non-native Species Manual Annex ‘Guidelines and resources
requiring further attention or development’ identified the need to
improve understanding of risks and pathways for marine
introduction. 
The CEP Five Year Plan identified the need for an assessment of the
risk of marine non-native species introductions; and 
The Climate Change Response Work Programme (CCRWP)
identified, as a high priority (Priority 1.8), the need to undertake a
risk assessment to identify marine habitats at risk of invasion and
pathways for introduction.
The aim of this Information Paper is to provide an update on recent
knowledge of ship activity within Antarctic Treaty area, focusing on
areas of high ship traffic. It identifies marine locations at high risk
of non-native marine species introductions. The contents of this
Information Paper are based predominantly on a recent academic
paper by McCarthy et al. (2022).
Ship traffic to Antarctica
Recent research has shown that an extensive network of ship
activity connects Antarctica directly to all global regions, especially
to South American, South Atlantic and European ports. Antarctic
gateway cities are important last ports of call, especially for
research and tourism vessels and were last ports of call for 63% of
voyages to Antarctica during the period 2014 to 2018. However,
during the same period, vessels departed direct to Antarctica from a
total of 58 ports (Figure 1). Therefore, a wide range of ports and
regions may act as direct connections for the introduction of
terrestrial or marine non-native species. It may be appropriate for
Parties to
give further consideration to the potential implementation of
appropriate practical biosecurity measures prior to vessel departure
for Antarctica.
Figure 1: The port-to-port traffic network of all ships that visited
Antarctica from 2014 to 2018 shows 75 ports had direct links to
Antarctica, including 58 last ports of call for Antarctic voyages.
Lines show connections between locations but do not show the path
travelled. Line opacity reflects the number of voyages between
ports, with darker lines representing more voyages. Circle colour
indicates the number of visits to each port, and circle size
represents the relative importance of ports within the network
based on their connectivity to other highly ranked ports.
Highest risk areas of introductions
Research has shown that ship visits are more than seven times
higher to the Antarctic Peninsula (especially east of Anvers Island)
and the South Shetland Islands than elsewhere around Antarctica:
together accounting for 88% of visits to Southern Ocean. Almost all
of the locations (18 of 20) most vulnerable to introductions from
marine non-native were located in the Antarctic Peninsula and
South Shetland Islands (see Table 1). Non-native species are
considered more likely to establish in these locations than other
parts of Antarctica, with for example the establishment of mussels
already reported in Maxwell Bay, King George Island (see Cárdenas
et al., 2020).
Conclusions
The Southern Ocean is the most isolated marine environment on
Earth and is the only global marine region without any known
biological invasions. However, ship movements related to fishing,
tourism, research and supply expose the Antarctic continent to
pollution, disturbance, and invasive non-native species. Increasing
ship activities in the region increase the opportunities for non-
native species introductions, while climate change makes non-
native species establishment more likely. Development and
implementation of methods to reduce
species transfer on vessels may go some way to reducing this risk
marine non-native species present to Antarctic marine habitats.

Table 1. Top 20 sites at risk of non-native species introductions,
based on the total number of visits, number of ships and median
time stopped from 2014-2018, and four sites from East Antarctica
for comparison. AP = Antarctic Peninsula, SSI = South Shetland
Islands, SOI = South Orkney Islands, RS = Ross Sea. Visit trend is
increasing (+), decreasing (-) or steady (=), based on the
cumulative mean number of visits from 2014-2018. Mean winter
temperature for the top 20 locations shown range from -1.727 to
-1.379, and for East Antarctic locations -1.890 to -1.784, data from
NOAA World Ocean Atlas. The mean ice-free days and estimated
percentage of days above 0ºC for each location is for 2014-2018.
