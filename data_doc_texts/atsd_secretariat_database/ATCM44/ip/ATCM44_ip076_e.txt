Wastewater management practices at Antarctic stations: Preliminary
survey results
Wastewater management practices at Antarctic stations: Preliminary
survey results
Information Paper prepared by COMNAP
Summary
A COMNAP survey was undertaken with the purpose to understand
current wastewater management practices on stations within the
Antarctic Treaty area by COMNAP Member national Antarctic
programmes. All Member programmes with stations responded to
the survey (Appendix 1).
Overall, survey results indicate that forty-six (46) stations use a
wastewater treatment system to manage wastewater, using one or
more treatment methods, comprising 69% of the stations operated
by COMNAP Member national Antarctic programmes in the
Antarctic Treaty area. Additionally, the survey indicates that, out of
the forty-six (46) stations having a wastewater treatment system,
forty-three (43) stations (93%) are using pre-treatment methods,
thirty-six (36) stations (78%) are using primary treatments, thirty-
seven (37) stations (80%) are using secondary treatments, and
thirty-one (31) stations (67%) are using tertiary treatment or
filtration methods.
Background
Annex III “Waste Disposal and Waste Management” to the
Environmental Protocol obliges Parties to reduce as far as
practicable the amount of wastes produced or disposed of in the
Antarctic Treaty area (Article 1(2)). Article 5(1) “Sewage and
domestic liquid wastes may be discharged directly into the sea…
provided that:” inter alia “(b) large quantities of such wastes
(generated in a station where the average weekly occupancy over
the austral summer is approximately 30 individuals or more) shall
be treated at least by maceration.”

doi:10.1111/j.1751-8369.2008.00056.x on waste disposal practices
at stations and from the “Advancing Antarctic Station Waste Water
Management Workshop”, held by COMNAP on 28 August, 2014, as
part of the COMNAP Annual General Meeting (AGM) in
Christchurch, New Zealand, as presented in ATCM XXXVIII (2015)
IP074, COMNAP undertook a survey in 2021/22 to understand
current wastewater management practices on stations within the
Antarctic Treaty area by COMNAP Member national Antarctic
programmes. Preliminary results are presented in this Information
Paper. COMNAP have also asked its membership to provide waste
and wastewater management data into the COMNAP database since
August 2021.
Survey
The COMNAP database lists (as of 26 October 2021) twenty-nine
(29) national Antarctic programmes as operating an open Antarctic
station. The COMNAP Secretariat conducted a survey through the
twenty-nine (29) COMNAP Member national Antarctic programme
Managers which were listed in the COMNAP database as
administering one or more open stations within the Antarctic Treaty
area. A total of sixty-seven (67) stations, thirty-nine (39) of which
are year-round and twenty-eight (28) are seasonal, have been
included in the survey which opened on 26 October 2021 and
closed, with an extended deadline, on 1 March 2022. Answers to
some of the survey questions for the sixty-seven (67) stations have
been recorded and presented in Appendix 2.
Results
This Information Paper presents preliminary results predominately
from Section 3 of the survey. In the survey, a non-exhaustive list of
examples was provided with each question as was the opportunity
to select “other” and add free text in response.
Question 7: Does this station have a wastewater treatment system?
Yes or No
There were forty-six (46) “Yes” responses to this question. Forty-six
(46) of the sixty-seven (67) stations included in the COMNAP
Database have a wastewater treatment system, using one or more
treatment methods, comprising 69% of the stations operated by
COMNAP Member national Antarctic programmes in the Antarctic
Treaty area. Thirty-one (31) of the stations which stated to have a
wastewater treatment system are year-round and fifteen (15) are
seasonal. Out of the twenty-one (21) stations that do not have a
wastewater treatment system, eight (8) are year-round and thirteen
(13) are seasonal. 79% of year-round stations have a wastewater
treatment system, meaning 21% lack a wastewater treatment
system; it is a 16% increase since 2009 Ibidem. A total of 54% of
seasonal stations have a wastewater treatment system, meaning
46% lack a wastewater treatment system; it is a 23% increase since
the 2009 Ibidem survey.
Question 9: Is pre-treatment used? Yes or No (e.g., separation of
oils/fats, removal of rags/solids, maceration, other)
Forty-three (43) of the forty-six (46) stations which have a
wastewater treatment system recorded an affirmative answer “Yes”,
meaning 93% of the stations are using pre-treatment methods as
part of their wastewater management practises.
Question 10: Is primary treatment used? Yes or No (e.g., settlement,
other)
Thirty-six (36) of the forty-six (46) stations which have a
wastewater treatment system recorded an affirmative answer “Yes”,
meaning 78% of the stations are using primary treatment methods
as part of their wastewater management practises.
Question 11: Is secondary treatment used? Yes or No (e.g., biolfilm,
aeration, membrane filtration, other) 
Thirty-seven (37) of the forty-six (46) stations which have a
wastewater treatment system recorded an affirmative answer “Yes”,
meaning 80% of the stations are using secondary treatment
methods as part of their wastewater management practises.
Question 12: Is tertiary treatment used? Yes or No (e.g., Ozone, UV
radiation, chlorination, reverse osmosis, hydrogen peroxide, other
advanced oxidation processes such as fenton catalytic reactions,
etc.)
Thirty (30) of the forty-six (46) stations which have a wastewater
treatment system recorded an affirmative answer “Yes” to Question
12, meaning 65% of the stations are using tertiary treatment as part
of their wastewater management practises. In addition, one station
replied “No” to Question 12 but “Yes” to Question 13 indicating
that tertiary filtration was used, meaning thirty-one (31) of 46
stations (67%) used a tertiary-level process (either treatment or
filtration or both).
Preliminary Comments and Conclusions
Further analysation of the survey results is required. Preliminary
results confirm that implementation and use of wastewater
treatment systems at Antarctic stations has increased since the time
of the last survey carried out in 2009 by 16% for year-round
stations and by 23%
for seasonal stations. In general, there is a higher level of
wastewater treatment use at year-round stations as compared with
seasonal stations. Overall, processes continue to improve with more
stations installing and using more sophisticated treatment methods
than ever before. In addition to the increased use of treatment
systems, a range of other positive practices have also been
implemented which aim to reduce the amount of wastewater
generated in the first instance or which use grey water recycling
systems and operations which also decreases both wastewater
discharge volumes and fresh water volume usage.
Appendix 1: COMNAP Wastewater Management Practices Survey
Wastewater Management Practices
 
The aims of this survey are to:    
(i) understand current wastewater management practices on
stations within the Antarctic Treaty area by COMNAP Member
national Antarctic programmes; and  
(ii) facilitate sharing of information.  
 
As a result of the survey, it is hoped the information gathered will
assist in further developing best practice related to the implemented
wastewater treatment systems and practical and technical
information: what worked well, what did not work well and why,
and cost/benefit issues.  
 
Please complete the survey for each station that your programme
operates in the Antarctic Treaty area.  
 
The questionnaire has been prepared by the COMNAP
Environmental Protection Expert Group, September 2021 and
reviewed by the COMNAP EXCOM.
