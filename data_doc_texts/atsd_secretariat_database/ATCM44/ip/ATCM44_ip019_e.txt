Annual Report 2021/22 Council of Managers of National Antarctic
Programs (COMNAP)
COMNAP Annual Report 2021/22 1 July 2021 – 1 April 2022
Highlights and Achievements
Key outcomes of COMNAP Annual General Meeting (AGM) XXXIII
(2021)
The AGM was scheduled for 12–14 July 2021in Toyama, Japan,
hosted by Japan’s National Institute of Polar Research. Due to the
continuing global pandemic, the in-person meetings were cancelled
and the AGM moved to an online platform across the same dates.
Plenary business, regional break-out and expert group sessions were
the main components. A total of 297 people from all 30 Member
programmes, five Observer programmes (see Table 1 in Attachment
1) and invited experts participated in one or more sessions across
the fourteen online sessions convened. During plenary business, a
new COMNAP Chair and four Vice Chairs were elected (see Table
2a in Attachment 1) and the Membership application from
TÜBITAK Marmara Research Center, Polar Research Institute,
Turkey, was unanimously approved; therefore, becoming the 31st
COMNAP Member programme.
Regional sessions were: Peninsula, Ross Sea, East Antarctica,
Larsemann Hills Management Group, Dronning Maud Land, and
High Plateau. The Antarctic High Plateau is becoming of increased
interest to the science community, with that area holding the key to
our understanding of how the Antarctic is a driver and responder to
change, with access to the world’s oldest ice, and providing a
unique and important atmospheric sciences platform with clear and
dark skies. National Antarctic programmes are actively supporting
and coordinating international efforts to provide globally important,
policy relevant cryosphere data from the Antarctic Treaty region.
Their facilities, vessels and scientific platforms are fundamental to
delivering such data. During all regional sessions, Members and
other operators exchanged pre-season information for Antarctic
research season 2021/22 noting intentions to return to near pre-
pandemic levels of activity, especially acting to support more
scientific personnel in the Antarctic than what was possible given
risk identified during the 2020/21 season.
Programmes freely exchanged and further developed their expertise
during topical Expert Group forums (see Table 2c in Attachment 1):
Air Operations/Aviation, Advancing Critical Technologies, Safety,
Education, Outreach & Training, Marine Platforms, Environmental
Protection, Science Facilitation, and Human Biology & Medicine.
Members endorsed the draft COMNAP Ambitions Framework that
addresses continuing to improve energy efficiency in our Antarctica
and inter-Antarctic operations, and looks to identify and quantify
improvements in environmental practices. COMNAP renewed its
COVID-19 Outbreak Prevention and Management Guidelines for the
2021/22 Antarctic Season, to assist national Antarctic programmes
in the preparation of their own protocols. The challenges were still
many, given the continuing global pandemic, however, programmes
continued to endorse the community-supported goal to keep
Antarctica COVID-19 free. Through the combined efforts of
everyone involved, through risk analysis and implementation of the
pre-departure isolation and testing protocols, it was possible to
identify positive cases in expeditioners before departure to
Antarctica. Contingency plans could then be implemented. As a
result, by-and-large, there was overall success and extremely low
COVID-19 cases in Antarctica within the national Antarctic
programme population since the start of the global pandemic (12
March 2020).
COVID-19 Preparedness & Response (see also IP to this ATCM)
As an organisation, COMNAP remained focused on devising a
strategy that collectively strengthened national efforts to avoid
introducing the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease to Antarctica.
Building on the COMNAP COVID-19 Outbreak Prevention &
Management
Guidelines for the 2020/21 Antarctic Season and addressing risk
related to the evolving global situation, COMNAP continued to
review and publish guidance (non-mandatory) especially for the
start of Antarctic season 2021/22. During COMNAP Townhall
Meetings, programmes shared preliminary plans to return to near
pre-pandemic levels of activity for the 2021/22 Antarctic season. In
March 2021, the Joint Expert Group on Human Biology & Medicine
(JEGHBM) produced information on COVID-19 Vaccination:
Current Predicted Challenges; Important considerations for National
Antarctic Programs Guidance for Members (V5.1).
Through the leadership of the Secretariat and the COVID-19 ad hoc
Subcommittee, COMNAP issued COVID-19 guidance, based on
current World Health Organisation (WHO) technical advice, on 15
June 2021, 15 July 2021, and 11 January 2022. The January 2022
version (9) has a specific focus on the omicron variant and was in
response to a review of the guidelines, given the positive cases
identified in Antarctic expeditioners in December 2021. In addition,
information was shared on boosters and immunity, and the
potential impact of variants on antigen tests.
The COVID-19 ad hoc Subcommittee remains convened. The
COMNAP COVID-19 Outbreak Prevention & Management
Guidelines (version 9, January 2022) continue to be reviewed and
evolve based on current research, WHO guidance, and the situation
globally. Regular and open communications continue with our
Members, Observers and other stakeholders, including IAATO.
In early 2022, COMNAP work began on understanding risks related
to moving from elimination guidance to mitigation guidance in
preparation for the 2022/23 Antarctic season and given the current
status of the global pandemic and advice from WHO.
COMNAP Projects
Antarctic Aviation Work continued on this project. COMNAP’s
additional advice to the ATCM in regards to the ATCM review of
Resolution 1 (2013) (no longer current), now Resolution 6 (2021),
is provided as WP017. The COMNAP Antarctic Aviation Workshop
was held in virtual format from 15 February−15 March 2022.
There were 95 registrants for the online workshop, which consisted
of 15 presentations and a plenary session. The COMNAP Antarctic
Aviation Workshop Report is available in IP006. The topic of Air
Operations and Safety both remain fundamental foci for COMNAP.
As a result of the workshop, new work for the Air Operations Expert
Group was identified, however, this specific project will be brought
to a close at COMNAP AGM (XXXIV) 2022 (July).
Earthquake, Tsunami, Volcanic Events Awareness
In response to national Antarctic programme concern about unusual
seismic activity around the Antarctic Peninsula, and the request by
the ATCM to COMNAP in Resolution 7 (2021) Earthquake
Emergency Management System, this project reviews, updates and
expands upon a COMNAP project on tsunami awareness (2012).
Preliminary information is available as WP018. A COMNAP project
Technical Collaboration Group will advance this work through to
COMNAP AGM (XXXV) 2023.
New Vessel Builds
This project showcased innovative examples of new icebreaking-
capable vessels via a peer-reviewed publication in Polar Record (see
BP002) and is now complete.
Antarctic Research Fellowships
Two COMNAP Antarctic Research Fellowships 2021 awarded: Paola
Barros Delben (Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis,
Brazil) “Health and Safety Risk Management in Isolation,
Confinement, and Extreme Contexts” working with the Instituto
Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida, Lisboa,
Portugal; and Renan Lima (Universidade
Federal do Rio Grande, Rio Grande, Brazil) “Coping with a fast-
changing environment: an isotopic insight on the foraging ecology
of pack-ice seals from the Antarctic Peninsula” working with the
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA. See also joint IP005.

COMNAP Products and Tools
Website & Database
The new website went live in October 2021. The website links
Members through to the COMNAP database (Quickbase application)
and requires a username/password to access. The database contains
information on facilities, vessels, and programme contacts, which is
used by the Membership and by the Secretariat to inform COMNAP
products. Some data is shared with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.
For example, on 6 December 2021, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat
announced that the Secretariat website had new links to COMNAP
facility data using a GIS map platform. Some data is publicly
available on the website and at
https://www.comnap.aq/antarctic-facilities-information and at
https://github.com/PolarGeospatialCenter/comnap-antarctic-
facilities/releases and https://github.com/PolarGeospatialCenter/
comnap-antarctic-vessels.
Antarctic Flight Information Manual (e-AFIM)
COMNAP AFIM general information
e-AFIM is a handbook of aeronautical information published in PDF
format as a tool towards safe air operations in Antarctica as per
ATCM Resolution 6 (2021). Releases were 15 September, 5 October,
1 December 2021 and 15 March 2022.
COMNAP Asset Tracking System (CATS) COMNAP Asset Tracking
System general information
CATS is a voluntary information exchange system developed by the
Australian Antarctic Division to display positional information for
situation-awareness of vessels. Recently, aircraft have been added to
the display. For the 2021/22 season at its peak use, CATS contained
positions for 63 assets (41 aircraft, 21 vessels and 1 research
balloon). We invite greater participation from operators with
vessels and aircraft operating in the Antarctic Treaty Area.
Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM)
ATOM is the collection of contact details to which ATCM
Recommendation X-3 refers. Access is via the COMNAP Quickbase
database and the CATS. Update of the ATOM is now in real-time,
meaning, when a national Antarctic programme updates their
information in the COMNAP Quickbase database, the field is
automatically updated in the online ATOM.
Search and Rescue (SAR) As per ATCM Resolution 4 (2013),
COMNAP provides a SAR webpage of all Rescue Coordination
Centre (RCC) contacts. The next triennial SAR Workshop (V) will
take place in 2023.
