Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in
Ushuaia during the 2021/2022 Austral summer season
Information Paper presented by Argentina
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and
vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2021/2022 Austral
summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. The number of
voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average
number of crew per vessel, and the registers of ships, are included
as well.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South
America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of
Antarctic ship-borne tourism since mid-1990´s, concentrating
approximately 90% of the ship-borne Antarctic tourist activity
worldwide.
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has
contributed to facilitate Antarctic cruise ships operations through
the port of Ushuaia. In addition to the short distance between
Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, those works allowed tour
operators to extend the frequency of their Antarctic operations
during the tourist season.
Regarding Antarctic ship-borne tourism that operates from the port
of Ushuaia, we can make a clear distinction between different types
of vessels, according to their activities in the Antarctic Peninsula
area. On the one hand, vessels that make landings at different
locations; on the other hand, vessels of a much larger size which
only sail Antarctic waters without enabling landings. Moreover, a
further distinction can be made when looking into the services
vessels require from the port of Ushuaia: those vessels that arrive in
Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American and Antarctic
itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia’s port as their summer
base of operations. Generally, in the latter case, operations carried
out in Ushuaia involve passenger changeover, using the city’s
airport, port and maritime services, as well as the general supply of
provisions and tourist services. Finally, it should be noted that at
the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic tourist season, most
vessels arrive to and/or depart from the port of Ushuaia, and
engage in positioning voyages from or towards other destinations.
However, given the situation caused by COVID-19, during the
season of analysis for this report (2021-2022), only voyages carried
out by vessels that made landings in Antarctica took place. These
vessels used the port of Ushuaia as a base port for their operations.
Large ships did not make trips this season.
In order to present the status of tourist flows of visitors and vessels
that, through Ushuaia’s port, visited Antarctica in the 2021/2022
season, data was collected from the ship’s dispatches It refers to the
inbound and outbound clearance documentation provided by the
master of the vessel. provided to “Prefectura Naval Argentina”
(Argentine Coast Guard), the national competent authority to that
effect. In some cases, this information was compared to the
itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data
obtained from alternate sources. Such information is used to
prepare a database for each Antarctic tourist season.
This document updates the data provided in similar papers
presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meetings since 2009, providing information that may contribute to
discussions related to Antarctic tourism.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that
operated via Ushuaia during the 2021/2022 Austral summer season
The 2021/2022 tourist season started on November 9th when the
vessel National Geographic Endurance (Lindblad Expeditions) set
sail for Antarctica, and finished on March 28th with the arrival of
the vessel Ocean Victory (Albatros Expeditions) to the port of
Ushuaia. There were a total of 135 voyages run by 23 vessels,
including the SV Bark Europa Other small vessels such as Hanse
Explorer, La Datcha and Nansen Explorer are not included in this
report.. December was the busiest month regarding the number of
Antarctic voyages, followed by January (see Figure 1).

per month.

2021/2022 ship’s dispatches, Argentine Coast Guard.
During the 2021/2022 season, 17,265 visitors went to Antarctica,
using Ushuaia as a connection port from and/or to the Antarctic
territory. As noted in the introduction to this report, all visitors
counted here correspond to vessels that have embarked and/or
disembarked passengers in Ushuaia on their itinerary to or from
Antarctica, using the local port as a base port for their operations.
These ships transported less than 500 passengers, thus being able to
make landings based on the provisions of Measure 15 (2009). It
should be noted that during the 2021/2022 season, no large ship
voyages carrying more than 500 passengers took place.
The average number of crew members and passengers The average
number of passengers on board is taken into account -not the
capacity of the vessel, because in some cases it could be that vessels
transport a smaller number of passengers than their total capacity.,
as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in Table
1. Figure 2 shows passenger averages per vessel.
Furthermore, 7 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica
operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account
for 30,43 % of the total number of vessels that were counted. Each
of these vessels made more than 7 voyages to Antarctica, as
indicated in Figure 3.

We registered the nationalities of passengers who went to
Antarctica via Ushuaia’s port, identifying more than 80
nationalities. Most of the passengers were from the United States,
followed by Germany, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom,
Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Argentina, Netherlands, among
others. Percentages of the main nationalities are represented in
Figure 4, where a total of 20 nationalities account for the 95,10% of
all visitors.

According to the registration of the vessels that operated in
Antarctica throughout this season from Ushuaia, we observed that
among the flag States of those vessels, three (3) are Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Parties (France, Netherlands and Norway) and one (1)
is a Non-Consultative Party (Portugal). On the other hand, four (4)
vessels are not registered to a Party to the Antarctic Treaty
(Bahamas, Cyprus, Marshall Islands and Malta) (see Figure 5).

Concluding remarks
From the gathered data, it has been possible to elaborate statistic
information allowing for the identification of the vessels that
operated in Antarctica using the port of Ushuaia, during the
2021/2022 season, the number of trips made, the number of
passengers and their nationalities, the average crew members per
vessel, and the countries where the ships are registered.
It is worth noting that due to the situation caused by the pandemic,
the 2021/2022 season has resumed trips to Antarctica after a
previous season (2020/2021) without Antarctic tourism activity.
However, there is a significantly lower number of ships, trips and
number of passengers compared to the 2019/2020 season, in which
a total of 68,360 visitors were transported to Antarctica via
Ushuaia, distributed in 41 vessels that made 314 trips. In other
words, during the season studied the decrease in the number of
visitors was practically 75% with regard to 2019/2020. It is
important to point out that large vessels did not participate during
this last season.
All tour operators followed the health protocols established due to
COVID-19. Several scheduled voyages were cancelled, and ships
were observed nearby Ushuaia harbor having to remain in isolation.
The data herein presented aims to contribute, as an alternative and
complementary source, in the assessment of tourism in the
Antarctic Peninsula region, with special emphasis on those tourist
vessels that call in at the port of Ushuaia.
