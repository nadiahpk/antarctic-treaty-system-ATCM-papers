Recent status of emperor penguin population in Northern Victoria
Land, Ross Sea
Information Paper submitted by the Republic of Korea
Summary
In the context of global warming, the emperor penguin population
is projected to decline significantly even under the most optimistic
scenario. To contribute to the protection and management as well
as the review of Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the
emperor penguin, the Republic of Korea provides monitoring
information of the colonies in Northern Victoria Land, Ross Sea.
Background
The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri Gray, 1844) is well
adapted for life on ice and endemic to Antarctica. Its colonies occur
in coastal regions around Antarctica and most of the colonies
depend on fast ice (Trathan et al. 2020). The population trend of
the species is predicted to be strongly linked to the condition of ice
cover around Antarctica. 80% of the emperor penguin colonies are
projected to be quasi-extinct under business-as-usual greenhouse
gas emission (Jenouvrier et al. 2020). However, under the most
optimistic scenario, the global emperor penguin population is
projected to decline by more than 50% (ATCM XLIV WP XX, draft
Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the emperor penguin
Aptenodytes forsteri Gray, 1844).
In this context SCAR introduced WP 37 Projections of future
population decline emphasise the need to designate the emperor
penguin as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species at CEP XXIII.
The Committee agreed to establish an ICG to prepare a draft Action
Plan to be presented to the ATCM XLIV-CEP XXIV.
The Action Plan shall be assessed and revised every 5 years. Each
review should ensure that Action Plan information is up to date,
based on the best available science. During the review, the
Committee should take into account the scientific data and
information provided by members (ref. draft Action Plan).
Since 2014, the Republic of Korea has run research and monitoring
programmes on emperor penguin colonies in Northern Victoria
Land, from Jang Bogo Station at Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea. Korea
Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) has conducted the programmes
supported by the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Oceans
and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea. We believe that our results
will contribute to the protection and management of the emperor
penguin as well as the review of the Action Plan.
Monitoring Methodology
There are three emperor penguin breeding colonies located along
the coast of Northern Victoria Land, Ross Sea. KOPRI conducted
population monitoring survey on three emperor penguin colonies,
Cape Washington (ASPA No. 173), Coulman Island and Cape Roget
(Figure 1). The colony at Cape Roget was surveyed by researchers
for the first time in November 2021. The emperor penguin chick
counting on Cape Washington was conducted seven times during
the austral summer seasons from 2014 to 2021. KOPRI surveyed the
colony of Coulman Island, one
of the largest colonies in Antarctica, four times from 2017 to 2021.
We visited on the ground and counted chicks in November 2014
and December 2015, while we applied high-resolution aerial
photography systems to determine the colony size of emperor
penguins from 2016. We could not visit the colonies of Cape
Washington and Coulman Island in 2020, because our field
activities had to be suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Population Status
Table 1 provides the colony size of each breeding site with number
of chicks in Northern Vitoria Land. A total of 16,793 emperor
penguin chicks were counted on November 15, 2021. The minimum
number of Cape Washington colony reported was 11,093 in 2002,
and the maximum number was 26,511 in 1992 (Table 1). After
24,997 chicks were counted in 2015, the colony size of emperor
penguin at Cape Washington was in downward trend, and
decreased to 12,472 in 2017. However, from 2018 to 2021, the
number has recovered and has shown a similar population size
compared to 2014. The maximum number of emperor penguin
chicks counted at Coulman Island was 34,765 in 1992 (Barber-
Meyer et al. 2008), whereas the mean number of chicks were
reported as 23,859. KOPRI have counted 23,223 chicks at the
colony in 2021, which is a decreased of 1,241 individuals when
compared to 24,464 chicks surveyed in 2019. The number of chicks
counted at Cape Roget was 8,021 in November 2021.
Discussion
The number of emperor penguin chicks at Cape Washington showed
fluctuation. This is thought to be influenced by the environmental
conditions such as sea ice concentration and regional weather
changes as reported in previous studies (Barber-Meyer et al. 2008,
Jenouvier et al. 2009). On the other hand, it was difficult to
describe the population fluctuation at Coulman Island due to a lack
of census data.
Both Cape Washington and Coulman Island qualify the criteria (A1,
A4ii) for Important Bird Area (IBAs) in Antarctica until 2021, and
no significant decline in emperor penguin population were detected
around these regions. Nevertheless, it is predicted that it will have a
negative impact on the emperor penguin population if global
warming and sea ice decreases continue in the future (Jenouvier et
al. 2009, Trathan et al. 2020).
KOPRI has been conducting long-term monitoring to understand
how environmental changes affect the dynamics of emperor
penguin population at Northern Victoria Land, Ross Sea. ATCM,
CCAMLR, and SCAR should encourage Parties to conduct relevant
research and monitoring activities that will contribute to the
protection and management of the emperor penguin.
