Microplastics in the Antarctic marine food web: evidence from
penguins
An Information Paper submitted by Portugal and the United
Kingdom
Summary
Microplastic pollution (plastic particles < 5 mm in diameter) has
been found in Antarctic waters and sediments, but the presence and
effects of microplastics within food webs still little understood. This
paper describes recent research reporting the presence of
microplastics in the marine food web of the wider Antarctic region,
with microplastics found in 20% of examined penguin faecal
samples. Portugal and the United Kingdom encourages future
studies on the potential effects of microplastic on penguins and
other Antarctic organisms and support further assessments of the
levels, origins and fates of microplastics within Antarctica.
Introduction
Within marine debris, plastic is the most commonly recovered item.
Microplastics has been reported in Antarctic sediment and onshore
surface waters, but recent studies show that offshore surface waters
have very low levels of microplastics. In one study that examined
benthic invertebrate fauna near Mario Zucchelli station, 83% of the
macrobenthic species contained microplastics. Further scientific
evidence shows that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) can turn
microplastics into smaller, nanoplastic particles through its
digestive system, with reduced acute toxicity, which may give us
information on the fate of microplastics. Here we report the
occurrence of microplastics in penguins in the Southern Ocean
(Bessa et al. 2019).
Assessing microplastics in penguins
Eighty penguin faecal samples (as a proof of ingestion), from gentoo
penguins from the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, were collected and
analysed (Bessa et al. 2019). Microplastic was found in 20% of
faecal samples. The microplastics included microfibers (58%),
fragments (26%) and films (16%) and were of different sizes,
colours and polymer compositions. Microplastic levels were lower
than those found in seabirds in other regions worldwide, which
could be attributed to the geographic isolation of the region and
low levels of human activity compared to other regions of the
world. Recently, microplastics have also been found in king
penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) (Le Guen et al 2020) from the
sub-Antarctic and other penguins (Fragão et al. 2021).
Conclusions
This research encourages Parties to conduct future studies on the
potential effects of microplastics on penguins and other Antarctic
organisms and supports further assessment of the levels, origins and
fates of microplastics within Antarctica in line with Resolution
5(2019).
