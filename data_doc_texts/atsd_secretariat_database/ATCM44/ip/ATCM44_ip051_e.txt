Communicating the Antarctic Treaty System

The 2021 report of the United Nations Secretary General entitled
“Our Common Agenda” (“the Report”) (https://www.un.org/en/
content/common-agenda-report/assets/pdf/
Common_Agenda_Report_English.pdf) is important and addresses
some of the most urgent challenges facing the international
community now and in the coming years. However, the section of
the Report dealing with the “Global Commons” erroneously
includes Antarctica and refers to Antarctica as “commons that are
beyond national jurisdiction.” Eight Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Parties informed the UN Under-Secretary General by letter that it is
not accurate to include Antarctica in discussions of the “Global
Commons” or “beyond national jurisdiction,” since the Antarctic
Treaty system (ATS) provides the internationally legally binding
framework governing the area.
The letter explained that the special legal status of Antarctica is set
out in the Antarctic Treaty and other ATS instruments. The
Antarctic Treaty establishes a regime of international cooperation
through Consultative Meetings. Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty
makes clear that nothing contained in the Treaty is “a renunciation
by any Contracting Party of previously asserted rights of or claims
to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica” or “a renunciation or
diminution by any Contracting Party of any basis of claim to
territorial sovereignty in Antarctica,” and does not prejudice the
position of any Contracting Party regarding its recognition or non-
recognition of claims or basis of a claim to territorial sovereignty in
Antarctica. The co-sponsors of this IP recall that all spatial
management plans in the Antarctic Treaty area are subject to the
terms of Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty.
The co-sponsors of this IP requested the United Nations give due
consideration to the points raised in the letter and noted that any
follow-up on the Secretary General’s Report regarding Antarctica
should take place in the ATS and at the initiative of the Contracting
Parties to the ATS agreements. The letter to the UN is attached.
