IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2021-22 Season and
Preliminary Estimates for 2022-23 Season
IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: A Historical Review of
Growth, the 2021-22 Season, and Preliminary Estimates for
2022-23
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide the statistical data compiled from Post
Visit Reports for the 2021-22 season and the preliminary estimates
for 2022-23 season as of 29 April, 2022.
It should be noted at the outset that the worldwide SARS CoV-2
pandemic has had a significant impact on Antarctic private sector
travel and consequently the numbers reported in this paper.
Specifically, we draw attention to the fact that:
During the 2020-2021 season, and the height of the pandemic, only
two yachts and 15 visitors operated in the Peninsula area. As this
was not a representative season for IAATO the 2020-2021 data has
been omitted from overall deliberations in this paper.
During the 2021-2022 season there was a resumption of activities
however these numbers remained depressed as some Operators took
the difficult decision not to operate during the 2021-22 season.
Furthermore, as Omicron became prevalent, others chose to cancel
expeditions or curtail their season. Lastly, in many cases, Operators
also had lower occupancy as fewer clients travelled.
Looking ahead to the 2022-2023 season while there is a hope
within IAATO’s membership for continued recovery and resumption
of activities, operations will continue to be dictated by the
pandemic evolution and worldwide travel restrictions.
We also take this opportunity to build on discussions with different
Treaty Parties around growth and diversification of activities, by
including a historical perspective which may aid ongoing
considerations. The data presented throughout this paper are based
on information provided to IAATO by its Operators in Post Visit
Reports. Visitor numbers reflect only those travelling with IAATO
Operator companies and do not include Observers, Government
Officials, or those individuals taking part in research projects that
are being supported by IAATO Operators. It does not include
information from any non-IAATO operators.
IAATO’s Membership continues to encompass the majority of
private-sector tour operators. Operator activities are permitted or
authorized through Environmental Impact Assessments, Advance
Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management Permits, and
submitted in advance of the season. Nearly all activities, which
follow IAATO policies and guidelines, have been authorised and
conducted on expeditions for more than two decades, and in many
cases since the beginning of Antarctic tourism circa the 1960’s.
IAATO Operators conduct their operations in a safe and
environmentally responsible manner, and all activities are planned
to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic
environment.
1.0 Historical Overview
1.1 IAATO Member Activities and Managing for Growth
Prior to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, the growth of the Antarctic
tourism industry was a topic of great interest within the Antarctic
and worldwide communities. In three decades, IAATO has seen two
other periods of growth - once during the mid-1990s and then again
in the period
2003-2008. During each of these periods of growth, and in the
intervening ‘lull’ in activities, IAATO has brought in a series of
tourism management measures, many of which were subsequently
adopted by the ATCM. With advancements in technology, reporting
and communications, and building on lessons learned in the past,
IAATO has been able to accurately forecast and monitor growth,
making measured decisions and advancements to properly position
the organisation as changes happen.
It is anticipated that with the current state of the global pandemic,
2022-23 activity levels will rise as forecasted to pre-pandemic rates.
Anticipating this, IAATO continues to strengthen, test, and refine
the suite of ‘tools’ to ensure the continued successful management
of activities.
Incremental changes on existing tools have been made during the
past ten years to address the continued increase in activities. More
recently one of these actions has been this a review of field staff
experience. IAATO set a benchmark in its early years that 75% of
field staff would have previous Antarctic experience. Over the
years, the breadth of activities offered has expanded as has the
range of operations, requiring a broader range of specialized skills
for field staff. With more advanced tools in place, such as the
IAATO Online Assessment and the development worldwide of
professional standards in guiding and other activities, this
benchmark has been reviewed to recognise and reflect these
changes. In accordance with IAATO Bylaws, Operators are required
to hire a sufficient number of expedition staff, at least 80% of
whom have previous professional guiding experience relevant to
their specific role (e.g. kayak guide, small boat drivers), and 50% of
whom have previous Antarctic experience, as agreed by IAATO
definition. During the 2022 IAATO Annual Meeting, IAATO
members agreed that organizers are not only required to ensure that
all field staff under their control take and pass the relevant IAATO
online assessment module, but also senior navigators (ex. Captains,
Safety Officer), other senior crew (ex. Hotel Manager,
Environmental Officer) and relevant office support staff.
Figures 1.1 – 1.3 give an overview of some of the key growth
management tools introduced by IAATO during three periods of
growth between 1993-2001.

1.2 IAATO Member Nationalities
Reflecting on the latest period of growth, the Post Visit Reports
submitted to IAATO indicate the top 10 nationalities who visited
Antarctica have remained relatively consistent over the last ten
seasons, although proportionately and prior to the pandemic, China
had seen the greatest increase in travelers to Antarctica. An
overview of the last 10 years can be found in Figure 2.

operators between 2012-2021
2.0 IAATO Seaborne Operations Overview
This section focuses on IAATO Seaborne Operations.
2.1 IAATO Seaborne Activities
For the last 31 years shipborne tourism on the Peninsula has been
the dominant vector of travel. The vast majority of tourism voyages
(98%) operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the seven-
month austral summer season (from October to April), and depart
from Ushuaia, Argentina or, to a lesser extent, from other ports
north of the Antarctic Treaty Area.
Currently, to the best of our knowledge, all commercial SOLAS
passenger ship Operators conducting tourism activities in the
Antarctic Treaty Area are members of IAATO. Table 1. offers a
summary of the last decade of both IAATO SOLAS and non-SOLAS
vessel tourism.

In accordance with IAATO Bylaws X – Section B, all Operators and
Provisional Operators are to comply with operational conditions
pursuant to the Antarctic Treaty System, including the Antarctic
Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty, along with IMO Conventions and similar
international and national laws and agreements.
2.2 Scope of IAATO Seaborne Activities
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small
inflatable boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boats, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.),
shore landings, and to a lesser extent activity such as, but not
limited to, kayaking, climbing, and short overnight stays.
Through the years descriptions and the type of activities have been
expanded in the Post Visit Reports to facilitate greater accuracy for
reporting and planning. For instance, RPAS Flights, although
banned recreationally in coastal waters by IAATO, has been
expanded to differentiate between commercial, scientific, and
operational/navigation flights. Likewise, what was once described
as swimming, has now been expanded to swimming – distance and
polar plunge.
Representing the current expansion of descriptions during this last
period of growth, Figure 3 illustrates activities offered by IAATO
vessels including yachts, during the 2021-2022 season. Small boat
cruising and landing remain the most popular activities (60%) for
vessels, while scenic ship cruising also remains a key activity. A
range of other activities (e.g. kayaking and short overnight stays)
contribute to a smaller portion (13%) of off-ship activities. It is
anticipated that ship cruising, small boat cruising and small boat
landings will continue to be the dominant activities and other
activities will remain small scale in comparison.
For more information on IAATO Operator activities see ATCM XLII
IP145 A Catalogue of IAATO Operator Activities.

Expedition Vessels and Yachts for 2021-22
3.0 IAATO Deep Field and Air Tourism Overview
IAATO currently has five Operators who conduct deep field tourism
activities. One air Operator also supports air-cruise operations and
offers single day or multi-day Antarctic experiences in the South
Shetland Islands. However, during the 2021-22 season, only three
deep field operators and one Peninsula air operator ran programs
for visitors. Table 2 provides an overview of Deep Field and Air
Operators primary areas of seasonal operation/base camp. Deep
Field Operators also utilise seasonal satellite field camps and
runways for their different activities and flights. Figure 4 gives an
overview of the deep field and air client numbers for the last
decade. Table 3 offers additional information of those operations.

Figure 4: Deep Field and Air Operator Clients 2012-2021
Deep Field and Air Operators usually maintain a higher client to
staff ratio than is typical for seaborne tourism, often one guide to
every three clients. The exception is solo expeditions, for example
during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are supported
remotely and closely monitored through communication protocols.
All Deep Field and Air Operators prepare contingency plans for the
health, safety, medical care and evacuation for their staff and
clients to meet ATCM Resolution 6 (2017).
3.1 Deep Field and Air Operator Programs and Activities
The last five seasons’ activities, including the operation of standard
programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions,
and logistical support of other expeditions, are outlined in Table 3:
Programs and Participant Numbers (clients) for 2016-21. Total
numbers participating include clients from all five IAATO Deep
Field Operators. Note that some clients participated in multiple
programs. Most activities detailed below have been offered
consistently since the 1990s and have not changed during this latest
period of growth. Additionally, activities for air Operator Aerovias
DAP are listed for seasons 2018 – 2021, reporting on their activities
since becoming an IAATO Member.
