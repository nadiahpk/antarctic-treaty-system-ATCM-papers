Report on emergency plans and implementation of natural disaster
risk assessment at Antarctic stations
Report on emergency plans and implementation of natural disaster
risk assessment at Antarctic stations
As per invitation to COMNAP in ATCM Resolution 7 (2021)
Summary
ATCM Resolution 7 (2021) invited COMNAP “to present a report to
assess the general situation of emergency plans at Antarctic bases
and its support operations, and the degree of implementation of
natural disaster risk assessment programmes”. A COMNAP survey
was undertaken to assess the general situation of emergency and
evacuation plans, procedures and the availability of shelters or
evacuation locations in case of natural disaster affecting Antarctic
stations and their support operations.
All Member programmes with stations responded to the survey.
Overall the survey results indicate that twenty (20) of the twenty-
nine (29) COMNAP Member national Antarctic programmes with
one or more stations in the Antarctic Treaty area have emergency
plans in the event of natural disaster. Additionally, the survey
results also indicated that twenty-three (23) of the twenty-nine (29)
COMNAP Member national Antarctic programmes with one or more
stations in the Antarctic Treaty area have shelters external to, and
as an alternative to, the station that can be used when needed
including in case of natural disaster.
Background
In response to national Antarctic programme concern about unusual
seismic activity around the Antarctic Peninsula, and the request by
the ATCM to COMNAP in Resolution 7 (2021) Earthquake
Emergency Management System, COMNAP began the project
“Earthquake, Tsunami, Volcanic Events Awareness”.
The project started with a desktop exercise to identify the locations
of all sixty-seven (67) Antarctic stations. In regards to natural
hazard, details such as station height above sea level and station
distance to nearest active volcano or active tectonic boundary are
important to overview.
While height above sea level is not the only risk factor for
inundation from tsunami, the desktop exercise indicates that forty-
one (41) stations are at a height above sea level less than or equal
to 30 metres, with twenty-one (21) of those stations sitting at a
height above sea level less than or equal to 10 metres. There are
twenty-seven (27) stations that sit at an altitude above 30 metres,
including many well-above this height. Work is continuing to
understand stations’ distances to active volcanoes and risk of
seismic activity in the region.
As the next step in the project, COMNAP will convene a Technical
Collaboration Group to identify knowledge gaps and collaboratively
strengthen the ability to actively prepare for, and in real-time
respond to, risk related to seismic-related hazard.
Through a survey, part of the project was aimed to provide a
response to the ATCM Resolution 7 (2021) which invites COMNAP
“to present a report to assess the general situation of emergency
plans at Antarctic bases and its support operations, and the degree
of implementation of natural disaster risk assessment programmes”.
A survey of all the COMNAP Member national Antarctic
programmes who administer an Antarctic station(s) in regards to
emergency plans was undertaken to assess the general situation of
emergency and evacuation plans, procedures and the availability of
shelters or evacuation locations in case of natural
disaster affecting Antarctic stations and their support operations.
This Working Paper presents the survey results for ATCM
consideration in response to the ATCM invitation to COMNAP.
Survey
The COMNAP database lists (as at 1 December 2021) twenty-nine
(29) national Antarctic programmes as operating an Antarctic
station. The COMNAP Secretariat conducted a survey through the
twenty-nine (29) COMNAP Member national Antarctic programme
Managers which were listed in the COMNAP database as
administering one or more open stations within the Antarctic Treaty
area. A total of sixty-seven (67) stations were included in the survey
which opened in December 2021 and closed on 28 February 2022;
answers for sixty-six (66) stations have been recorded (Table 1).
Question 1: Does this station have emergency plans for natural
disaster?
Forty-four (44) stations recorded an affirmative answer “Yes” and
twenty-one (21) stations recorded a “No” answer for Question 1.
One (1) station recorded a “not applicable” answer. Meaning 66%
of stations have emergency plans for natural disaster.
Question 2: Does this station have external shelters? If yes, how
many?
Forty (40) stations recorded an affirmative answer “Yes” and
twenty-six (26) stations recorded a “No” answer for Question 2.
Meaning 60% of stations have external shelters.
