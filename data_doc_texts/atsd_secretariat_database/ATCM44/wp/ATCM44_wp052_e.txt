Proposal for Modifications to the Location Coordinates of Nine
Historic Sites and Monuments
Proposal for Modifications to the Location Coordinates of Nine
Historic Sites and Monuments
Working Paper submitted by Argentina
Summary
A proposal is presented to modify the coordinates of nine HSMs for
which Argentina is in charge or shares the responsibility of their
management, so that they are included through the approval of a
measure, in the Database of Historical Sites and Monuments of the
Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty.
The information presented in this Working Paper is complemented
by Information Paper XX Analysis of the precision of the location
coordinates of some Historic Sites and Monuments.
Background
Based on the proposals presented by Argentina to ATCM XLII in
WP 65 (2019) and in ATCM XLIII with WP 60 rev. 1 (2021), the
Meeting then agreed to add new information fields to the list of
Historic Sites and Monuments (HSM), as established in Decision 1
(2019), in order to ensure consistency, improve information and
harmonise it with recent developments in policies and debates
between Parties regarding HSMs. For this reason, finally, the new
HSM listing was adopted through Measure 23 (2021).
In line with Decision 1 (2019), the fields related to the state of
conservation and management tools contain information that may
require relatively frequent updating due to the nature of the
information they contain. Thus, the list of HSMs is a formal
mechanism established through the Environment Protocol, and any
changes to the list have historically required a specific Measure.
This Decision established that certain fields (including "location")
remain a formal part of the list and that any changes in those fields
require adoption through a Measure. Moreover, it established that,
in the case of other fields considered complementary information to
the list of HSMs, any change must be agreed by the CEP and
communicated in its report to the ATCM.
Revision
Based on the provisions of paragraph 4(c) and (d) of the appendix
to Resolution 3 (2009) Guidelines for the designation and
protection of Historic Sites and Monuments, Argentina undertook a
comprehensive review of the location of the following HSMs:
The purpose of the revision is to establish a more precise position
than that currently recorded in the list of Historic Sites and
Monuments (Measure 3 (2021)). The general problem detected is
that when expressing coordinates "by minute", this means taking
discrete staggered steps approximately 2 km apart (1852 m = 1
nautical mile) with regards to latitude, with no intermediate
alternatives (for longitude, this is multiplied by the cosine of the
latitude). This situation means that the representation of the sites in
some Geographic Information Systems does not allow the precise
location of the HSMs.
Based on their revision, Argentina proposes to amend the
description of Historic Sites and Monuments for HSM 26, 29, 36,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43, who is responsible for its management or
shares with other parties based on Measure 3 (2003), by changing
their “location” to establish more precise coordinates. The new
geographic coordinates of said sites can be found in Appendix A to
this document.
Appendix B: DRAFT MEASURE
Measure XXX (2022)
Historic Sites and Monuments: New Location Coordinates of HSMs
No. 26, 29, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43
The Representatives,
Noting the requirements of Article 8 of Annex V to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to maintain a list
of existing Historic Sites and Monuments, and noting that these
sites must not be damaged, removed or destroyed;
Noting, likewise, the Guidelines for the designation and protection
of Historic Sites and Monuments adopted by Resolution 3 (2009)
and the Guidelines for the assessment and management of heritage
in Antarctica adopted by Resolution 2 (2018); Also taking into
accountDecision 1 (2019), in which the Parties agreed to add the
new information fields to the existing fields in the "List of Historic
Sites and Monuments";
Taking into account that the Historic Sites and Monuments involved
have been designated by means of Recommendation VII-9 (HSM 26,
29, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42) and Recommendation VII-9 Measure
5 (1997) (HSM 41); Looking to update the descriptions of Historic
Sites and Monuments 26, 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43 included
in Measure 23 (2021), in accordance with the format prescribed by
Decision 1 (2019); Recommend their Governments the following
Measure for its approval, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article
8 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty:
That the corrections in the geographic coordinates proposed for
HMS 26, 29, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43 be approved, as
indicated in the Appendix to this Measure, and
That the new geographical coordinates of these HSMs be included
in the Database of Historic Sites and Monuments of the Secretariat
of the Antarctic Treaty.
