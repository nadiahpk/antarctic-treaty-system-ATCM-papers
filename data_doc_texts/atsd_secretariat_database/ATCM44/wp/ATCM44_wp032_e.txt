Summary
In accordance with Item 3 of Article 6 of Annex V to the Protocol
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Guide
to the Preparation of Management Plans for the Antarctic Specially
Protected Areas (Resolution 2 (2011)), the Russian Federation,
based on newly obtained data, conducted a five-year Revision of the
Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No 127
“Haswell Island” (Haswell Island and the adjacent fast ice field with
a colony of emperor penguins) and came to the conclusion that only
minor changes are necessary.
A minor editorial revision was made to bring the document into
conformity with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of
Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas
(Resolution 2 (2011)).
Data from sightings and zoological surveys conducted over a five-
year period were added to subsection 6(i), hence Table 4 was
amended with information for the 2020/2021 season.
Recommendation
The Russian Federation invites the CEP to approve the attached
Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No 127
“Haswell Island” (Haswell Island and the adjacent fast ice field with
a colony of emperor penguins).
