Discovery of the wreck of Endurance - Updating information for
HSM 93 and Development of a Management Plan
A Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and South
Africa
Summary
This paper proposes to update information in the listing of HSM 93,
Wreck of Endurance, following its discovery on 5 March 2022.
Recalling Resolution 2 (2021) and Decision 1 (2021) the United
Kingdom and South Africa recommend that the Committee:
Recommends the ATCM adopts a Measure (draft at Annex II) to
update the ‘Description’, ‘Site Location’, ‘Conservation Status’,
‘Management Tools’, and ‘Physical features of the environment and
cultural and local context’ information fields of HSM 93; and
Notes that a Management Plan will be developed for HSM 93, now
that the wreck has been located.
Background
The wreck of the Endurance, the vessel owned and used by Sir
Ernest Shackleton during his 1914-16 Imperial Trans-Antarctic
Expedition, was designated an Historic Site & Monument (HSM)
through Measure 12 (2019). At the time of designation the actual
location of the wreck was unknown. However the Endurance’s
skipper and master navigator, Captain Frank Worsley, recorded the
coordinates of the location of sinking of the ship, and these were
included in the original HSM designation.
Endurance22 Expedition
The British-led Endurance22 expedition set out from Cape Town,
South Africa on 5 February 2022 with the aim to locate, identify
and survey the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship Endurance,
which was trapped and crushed by the ice and sank in the Weddell
Sea in 1915. Embarked on board the South African vessel S.A.
Agulhas II, the Endurance22 expedition team used SAAB Sabertooth
underwater vehicles to search for the wreck.
On 5 March 2022, the Endurance22 expedition found the
Endurance at a depth of 3,008 metres in the Weddell Sea at location
68°44'21'' S, 52°19'47'' W, one hundred years to the day after the
burial of Sir Ernest Shackleton.
Description of the shipwreck
The ship was found in a remarkable state of preservation given its
fate in 1915. The hull sits upright on the sea bed with many of its
recognisable features still visible. The ship’s name and polestar
remain emblazoned across the stern, and the ship’s wheel and the
anchor chains are still in place. The masts and rigs, which were lost
when the ship was crushed by the ice, are, as expected, in a
collapsed state. But the pictures show a vessel still very much
recognisable.
The Endurance22 expedition captured high definition film, 4K
resolution photography, and laser scans of the entire wreck. This
data will be used for further analysis and will provide
unique visual access to the ship 107 years after it was lost to the
Weddell Sea. The photographs have been reproduced in this paper
with the kind permission of the expedition

Observed Biodiversity
The images obtained by the expedition have also provided
opportunity for study of biodiversity colonising the wreck. British
Antarctic Survey scientists have studied the video from the wreck,
and determined that the Endurance is home to a wide variety of
sessile, filter feeding animals and what appears to be a type of squat
lobster. The filter feeding animals include many large sea
anemones, a stalked crinoid (sea lily), numerous tunicates (sea
squirts), probable hydroids, and glass sponges (Hexactinellidae) - all
of which are classed as vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) taxa by
CCAMLR, and a six-armed brisingid starfish. In addition to the filter
feeding animals, several decapod crustaceans, most likely squat
lobsters from the genus Munidopsis,
were observed on the decks of the ship, although further
identification for all the animal groups will require higher
resolution images.

Whilst the discovery of marine life on the wreck after 107 years is
not unexpected, the observations represent the second ever record
of a squat lobster within Antarctic waters, and the first for the cold
waters of the Weddell Sea. Knowing the date of the sinking also
offers scientists a unique timeframe for natural colonisation of hard
substrates and growth rates of important animal groups in the
Antarctic deep sea. The remarkable preservation of the timbers of
the ship also supports previous theories that wood eating organisms
(such as shipworms a burrowing type of bivalve mollusc),
commonly found elsewhere in the world's oceans, are absent from
Antarctic waters due to the lack of any nearby forests on the land.
Updating the record for HSM 93
Now that the wreck has been located, we can provide updated
information for the listing of HSM 93. On advice from the
International Polar Heritage Committee (IPHC) and International
Committee on Underwater Cultural Heritage (ICUCH), it is also
recommended that the area encompassed by the HSM listing is
expanded from 150m to 500m radius. This is in recognition that the
current 150m radius is likely insufficient to capture all of the
historic material that will have dispersed while dropping through
more than 3,000m of water.
Development of a Conservation Management Plan
The Endurance has been located in a well-preserved state, and its
discovery has generated considerable heritage and scientific
interest. In line with best practice for HSMs, the UK therefore plans
to develop a Conservation Management Plan as a guiding document
for the conservation and management of the wreck, as well as to
consider any additional forms of protection that may be required.
The Conservation Management Plan will be developed during the
2022-2023 intersessional period, in consultation with relevant
expert bodies including the IPHC, ICUCH and other interested
organisations, and presented to CEP XXV.
Recommendations
The United Kingdom and South Africa recommend that the
Committee:
Recommends the ATCM adopts a Measure (draft at Annex II) to
update the ‘Description’, ‘Site Location’, ‘Conservation Status’,
‘Management Tools’, and ‘Physical features of the environment and
cultural and local context’ information fields of HSM 93; and
Notes that a Conservation Management Plan will be developed for
HSM 93, now that the wreck has been located.

(ix) Description of the historical context
Endurance was the vessel owned and used by Sir Ernest Shackleton
during his 1914-16 Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Endurance became
beset in the sea ice before being crushed and eventually sinking to
the sea floor in 1915. What followed was a daring rescue by
Shackleton by taking the lifeboat James Caird to South Georgia to
fetch help. All the men marooned on Elephant Island were saved
and retuned home in 1916.

(xiii) Physical features of the environment and cultural and local
context
The exact location of the wreck is unknown as the ship floated in
the pack ice for some distance. We know that the wreck is
somewhere, approximately 2 miles deep, on the seabed in the
Weddell Sea. Location records made by Frank Worsley, Shackleton’s
skipper and master navigator, give precise coordinates of the
location of sinking of the ship but these have not been verified since
1915. These last known coordinates have been included as the
‘location’.
The wreck is located on the floor of the Weddell Sea at a depth of
3,008m at location 68°44'21'' S, 52°19'47'' W .
