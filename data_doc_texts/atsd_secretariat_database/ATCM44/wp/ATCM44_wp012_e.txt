Prior assessment of a proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area at
Otto-von-Gruber-Gebirge (Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica)
Working Paper submitted by Germany and the United States of
America
Summary
A prior assessment for a proposed Antarctic Specially Protected
Area (ASPA) Otto-von-Gruber-Gebirge (Dronning Maud Land, East
Antarctica) has been carried out by Germany and the United States
of America. The proponents recommend that the CEP: (1) agrees
that the values within the proposed ASPA merit special protection,
(2) endorses the development of a Management Plan for the area,
and (3) encourages interested Parties to work with Germany and
the United States of America informally during the intersessional
period in the development of a Management Plan for submission to
CEP XXV.
Introduction
In accordance with the provisions in Annex V to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Protocol),
Germany and the United States of America would like to propose
the establishment of an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA)
Otto-von-Gruber-Gebirge (Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica).
The proposed ASPA would be a multi-site ASPA intended primarily
to protect a range of values.
Environmental values:
large and deep ice-covered freshwater lakes (Untersee, Obersee)
with extremophile microbial ecosystems (including the only known
large, conical stromatolites in Antarctica);
large breeding colony of snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea);
isolated polar desert oasis ecosystem with sparse vegetation.
Scientific values:
ecology: lakes as habitat for microbial extremophiles;
ecology: uncommon lake chemistry with one of the highest
dissolved methane concentrations in a natural aquatic ecosystem;
ecology: dynamics of the population of one of the largest known
snow petrel colonies and the significance of such habitat for the
global population of this species;
exobiology: ecosystems of the perennially ice-covered lakes
represent analogues to study conditions for possible extra-terrestrial
life;
geomorphology/paleoclimatology: mountain landscape with a high
variety of glacial, periglacial and high alpine processes, landforms
and sediments;
paleoclimatology: large subfossil stomach oil deposits (‘mumiyo’) of
snow petrels as a valuable paleoclimatological archive
geology: rocks among the youngest known massif-type anorthosite
formations world-wide.
Historic values:
plaque placed for commemorating the first visit by the Soviet
Antarctic Expedition in 1969.
Aesthetic values:
spectacular mountain peaks protruding from the inland ice sheet.
Wilderness values:
low human footprint.
Ongoing scientific research:
limnology, aquatic ecology, microbial ecology, geochemistry,
periglacial geomorphology, exobiology.
Prior assessment
Following discussions at CEP XX (2017), the Guidelines: A prior
assessment process for the designation of ASPAs and ASMAs were
up dated to include a non-mandatory ASPA prior assessment
template to facilitate the provision of information consistent with
the Guidelines (ACEP XX report, Appendix A). Germany and the
United States of America have completed the prior assessment
template for the proposed ASPA (see Attachment A), which includes
a map, photos and a list of relevant publications.
If the CEP agrees that the area merits special protection, Germany
and the United States of America intend to develop intersessionally
a Management Plan for the proposed ASPA in collaboration with all
interested parties to be submitted for consideration during CEP
XXV.
Recommendations
Germany and the United States of America recommend that the
CEP:
notes the completed prior assessment for a proposed multi-site
Antarctic Specially Protected Area at the Otto-von-Gruber-Gebirge
(Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica) at Attachment A
agrees that the values within the proposed ASPA merit special
protection, as described under Annex V to the Protocol;
endorses the development of a Management Plan for the Area, led
by Germany and the United States of America; and
encourages interested parties to work with Germany and the United
States of America informally during the intersessional period in the
development of a Management Plan for submission to CEP XXV.
