Report of the CEP Intersessional Contact Group established to
develop a Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the emperor
penguin
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom as ICG Convener
Summary
This paper reports on the outcomes of the CEP Intersessional
Contact Group (ICG) tasked with the preparation of a draft Action
Plan for the emperor penguin for presentation at ATCM XLIV - CEP
XXIV together with SCAR’s assessment of the emperor penguin’s
conservation status (Vulnerable).
The ICG recommends that the CEP:
considers the draft Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the
emperor penguin developed by the ICG and provided as Attachment
A to this Working Paper;
forwards the draft Action Plan and SCAR’s assessment of the
conservation status of the emperor penguin (provided in ATCMXLIII
WP37) to the ATCM for their consideration; and
recommends to the ATCM (i) the designation of the emperor
penguin as a Specially Protected Species under Annex II to the
Protocol through adoption of the draft Measure in Annex 1 and (ii)
that it encourages Parties to undertake the timely implementation
of the Specially Protected Species Action Plan.
Background
At CEP XXIII, SCAR introduced WP 37 Projections of future
population decline emphasise the need to designate the emperor
penguin as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species. SCAR described
how loss of breeding habitats and the profound transformation of
the foraging habitat associated with significant change in and loss
of sea ice as part of climate change are primary threats to emperor
penguins.
In its review on the status of the emperor penguin, SCAR found that
the emperor penguin was vulnerable to ongoing and projected
climate change, thereby warranting protection as an Antarctic
Specially Protected Species. SCAR recommended that the
Committee establish an ICG to review the draft Action Plan
prepared by SCAR (provided in Annex A to ATCMXLIII WP37) and
provide a draft Action Plan.
The Committee agreed to establish an ICG to prepare a draft action
plan for the emperor penguin to be presented to ATCM XLIV - CEP
XXIV, together with SCAR’s assessment of the emperor penguin’s
conservation status (provided in ATCMXLIII WP37).
The Committee agreed that the ICG would operate in accordance
with the following terms of reference:
With reference to the ‘Guidelines for CEP Consideration of
Proposals for New and Revised Designations of Antarctic Specially
Protected Species under Annex II of the Protocol’, and taking into
consideration ATCM XLIII/WP37, ATCM XLIII/IP22 and other input
from Members, Observers, and other relevant scientific,
environmental and technical organisations, prepare a draft Action
Plan for the emperor penguin.
Report to CEP XXIV
At the fortieth meeting of the CCAMLR Scientific Committee,
Working Paper SC-CAMLR/40-9 rev.1 informed CCAMLR about the
work of the ICG, including an invitation to CCAMLR
Members to provide advice on practical measures to provide special
protection for the emperor penguin.
Development of the Action Plan
During the 2021-22 intersessional period, an ICG called
‘Development of a Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the
emperor penguin’ was established that communicated via the CEP
Forum. The ICG was convened by Dr Kevin Hughes of the United
Kingdom. The ICG undertook six rounds of discussion with
participation by Argentina, Australia, China, Ecuador, France,
Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, the
United Kingdom, the United States, ASOC, COMNAP, IAATO and
SCAR. The draft Action Plan was prepared with reference to the
‘Guidelines for CEP Consideration of Proposals for New and Revised
Designations of Antarctic Specially Protected Species under Annex II
of the Protocol’ and took into consideration information contained
within ATCM XLIII WP37 and ATCM XLIII IP22.
The draft Action Plan is provided as Attachment A to this Working
Paper. The draft Action Plan is comprised of several sections.
Section 2 provides background information on emperor penguin
biology, conservation status, vulnerability to direct and indirect
threats and also provides details of Antarctic Treaty System
agreements and management tools that are in place to protect this
species. In Section 3, the Action Plan goal is established and in
Section 4 the overarching objectives to deliver the goal are set out.
In Section 5, specific actions are described for each objective,
including the provision of information on the relevant spatial scale
of each action, the emperor penguin life cycle stage the action is
relevant to and the identification of the organisation(s) that will
lead work to deliver the action.
SCAR’s assessment of the emperor penguin’s conservation status
The assessment by SCAR of the conservation status of the emperor
penguin is provided in ATCMXLIII WP37. In this assessment, SCAR
states that models and analyses ‘indicate that the species might best
be classified within the IUCN Red List as ‘Vulnerable’’.
Conclusion
To fulfil the ICG Terms of Reference, the Group has produced the
draft Specially Protected Species Action Plan, provided as
Attachment A, and SCAR’s assessment of the conservation status of
the emperor penguin is provided in ATCMXLIII WP 37. These
outputs provide the basis for an assessment by the CEP and
recommendation to the ATCM regarding the designation of the
emperor penguin as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species, as set
out in Article 3(4) of Annex II to the Protocol.
Recommendation
The ICG recommends that the CEP:
considers the draft Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the
emperor penguin developed by the ICG and provided as Attachment
A to this Working Paper;
forwards the draft Action Plan and SCAR’s assessment of the
conservation status of the emperor penguin (provided in ATCMXLIII
WP37) to the ATCM for their consideration; and
recommends to the ATCM (i) the designation of the emperor
penguin as a Specially Protected Species under Annex II to the
Protocol through adoption of the draft Measure in Annex 1 and (ii)
that it encourages Parties to undertake the timely implementation
of the Specially Protected Species Action Plan.
Annex 1. Draft Measure for the designation of the emperor penguin
as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species.
Measure X (2022)
Specially Protected Species: emperor penguin
The Representatives, Recalling Article 3(4) of Annex II to the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty ("the
Protocol"), providing for the designation of Specially Protected
Species to be accorded special protection by the Parties; Further
recalling that the Committee for Environmental Protection ("CEP")
adopted at CEP VIII guidelines for consideration of proposals for
new and revised designations of Specially Protected Species;
Concerned about the implications for Antarctica arising from a
warming global climate, including changes to the Antarctic and
Southern Ocean ecosystems;
Noting that the extent of sea ice around Antarctica reached a record
low in early 2022 and bearing in mind the predicted decline in sea
ice upon which the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) largely
relies for breeding habitat;
Noting that SCAR has determined the conservation status of the
emperor penguin to be ‘vulnerable’; Believing that, in the light of
the scientific advice from SCAR, the emperor penguin should now
be added to the list of Specially Protected Species contained in
Appendix A to Annex II to the Protocol; Noting the work by the CEP
to produce a Specially Protected Species Action Plan for the
emperor penguin, the goal of which is ‘to reduce and, where
practicable, prevent threats to emperor penguins and their habitat
at all stages of their life cycle, taking into account observed and
potential impacts of climate change on emperor penguins, in order
to improve the threat status and degree of endangerment of the
species’.
Recommend to their Governments the following Measure for
approval in accordance with Article 9 of Annex II to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: That:
the emperor penguin be designated as a Specially Protected Species
and in Appendix A to Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the words "Aptenodytes forsteri,
emperor penguin" be added; and
the Specially Protected Species Action Plan that is annexed to this
Measure be approved.
