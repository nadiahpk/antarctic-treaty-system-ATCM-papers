Prior assessment of a proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area at
Danger Islands Archipelago (North-eastern Antarctic Peninsula)
Working Paper submitted by Germany and the United States of
America
Summary
A prior assessment for a proposed multi-site Antarctic Specially
Protected Area (ASPA) at Danger Islands Archipelago (North-
eastern Antarctic Peninsula) has been carried out by Germany and
the United States of America. The proponents recommend that the
CEP: (1) agrees that the values within the proposed ASPA merit
special protection, (2) endorses the development of a Management
Plan for the area, and (3) encourages interested Parties to work
with Germany and the United States of America informally during
the intersessional period in the development of a Management Plan
for submission to CEP XXV.
Introduction
In accordance with the provisions in Annex V to the Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Protocol),
Germany and the United States of America propose the
establishment of an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) at
Danger Islands Archipelago (North-eastern Antarctic Peninsula).
The proposed ASPA would be a multi-site ASPA intended primarily
to protect a range of values.
Environmental values:
Area in which > 50 % of the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
population of the Antarctic Peninsula Region exist;
Area with 1.2 % of the global population of Antarctic shags
(Phalacrocorax atriceps);
Area of high biodiversity with breeding sites of 8 additional bird
species.
Scientific values:
Key area for population monitoring of Adélie penguins (55 % of the
population of CCAMLR subarea 48.1);
Key area for understanding the ecology of the regional ecosystem
with its Adélie penguin population as a regional hotspot and
representative for the relatively stable Weddell Sea region colonies
(compared to those in other areas);
Large deposits of ornithogenic soils provide high potentials for
studying paleoecology.
Wilderness values:
Low or medium human footprint for the different sites of the area.
Aestethic values:
Medium because of spectacular geomorphological formations in
some areas.
Prior assessment
Following discussions at CEP XX (2017), the Guidelines: A prior
assessment process for the designation of ASPAs and ASMAs were
updated to include a non-mandatory ASPA prior assessment
template to facilitate the provision of information consistent with
the Guidelines (CEP XX report, Appendix A). Germany and the
United States of America have completed the prior assessment
template for the proposed ASPA (see Attachment A), which includes
maps, photos and a list of relevant publications.
If the CEP agrees that the area merits special protection, Germany
and the United States of America intend to develop intersessionally
a Management Plan for the proposed ASPA in collaboration with all
interested parties to be submitted for consideration during CEP
XXV.
Recommendations
Germany and the United States of America recommend that the
CEP:
notes the completed prior assessment for a proposed multi-site
Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Danger Islands Archipelago
(North-eastern Antarctic Peninsula) at Attachment A;
agrees that the values within the proposed ASPA merit special
protection, as described under Annex V to the Protocol;
endorses the development of a Management Plan for the Area, led
by Germany and the United States of America; and
encourages interested parties to work with Germany and the United
States of America informally during the intersessional period in the
development of a Management Plan for submission to CEP XXV.
