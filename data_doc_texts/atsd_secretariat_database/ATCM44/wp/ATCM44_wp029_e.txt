Antarctica in a Changing Climate – Implementing ATCM Resolution

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Australia,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
United States, SCAR and in conjunction with ASOC
Summary
This paper provides an update to the ATCM on the implementation
of Resolution 8 (2021) Antarctica in Changing Climate, one year
after its adoption.
The United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Finland, France,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United States, SCAR and ASOC
recommend that, consistent with Resolution 8 (2021), the ATCM
encourages Parties to:
Support research on the actual and potential implications of climate
change (including the global threats arising from potential
thresholds and tipping points on the Antarctic ice shelf);
Continue to support SCAR in the communication of the latest
research and information on climate change and its impacts,
through its regular and valued updates to the ATCM, including the
Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment (ACCE) report; and
Support the work of the CEP to consider the environmental
implications of climate change through the Climate Change
Response Work Programme, and continue to report on efforts to
understand and address other implications for the management of
Antarctica.
Implementing Resolution 8 (2021) Antarctica in Changing Climate
Resolution 8 (2021) Antarctica in a Changing Climate was adopted
at ATCM XLIII in response to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere
in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The SROCC provided clear
evidence that climate change is having a profound impact on
Antarctica, and that these impacts have consequential global effects.
Resolution 8 (2021) recommended that Parties consider, research
and communicate the implications of climate change for Antarctica,
including at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change Conference of Parties 26 (UNFCCC COP26), and seek to
avoid or mitigate further stresses to Antarctic terrestrial and marine
biodiversity and ecosystems.
This working paper provides an update to the ATCM on progress in
implementing Resolution 8 (2021) one year after its adoption with
a specific focus on how the implications of climate change in
Antarctica were widely communicated and shared with delegates,
attendees and the wider public at the Glasgow Climate Summit,
COP26 (31 October to 12 November 2021).
The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), the
International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), the Association
of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS), the UK Arctic and
Antarctic Partnership (UKAAP) and Antarctic and Southern Ocean
Coalition (ASOC) member WWF have compiled a list of events held
and briefings shared (Appendix 1) about Antarctica in a changing
climate in the run up to, during and immediately after COP26. The
list is not intended to be exhaustive. Nevertheless, it highlights
more than 20 events/briefings that were
held to share current science and to inform decision-makers about
the implications of climate change in Antarctica, and the
consequences for the rest of the planet.
The events and briefings focused overwhelmingly on two broad
themes: 1) the contribution of Antarctic ice sheets to irreversible
global sea level rise with implications for coastal communities,
including small island developing states (SIDS); and 2) Southern
Ocean ecosystems (including krill) under pressure from climate
change, acidification and freshening, and their role in helping to
maintain a stable climate. Together, they highlighted the need for
urgent action to mitigate global climate change, alongside effective
local conservation and management in order to minimise or avoid
further dangerous and irreversible sea level rise and degradation of
Southern Ocean ecosystems and the associated loss of their wide-
ranging societal benefits. Other themes included Antarctica’s
scientific past and strategic priorities for UK Antarctic science.
