of the ‘Base F’, which was built by the UK in 1947. Wordie House
was recognised for its historical importance and adopted by means
of Measure 4 (1995) as Historic Site and Monument No. 62 under
the Antarctic Treaty. Visits to the site are managed by the United
Kingdom and on site by the Station Leader at nearby Vernadsky

visitor zone with recommended path to the top of the island’s ice
cap were added, as well as the site map for the VSG was updated
and improved.
