Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the
Thirty-Fourth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
Introduction
1.	The Twenty-ninth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources was held in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, from 25 October to 5 November 2010.  It was chaired by Ambassador D. MacKay (New Zealand).
2.	All 25 Members of the Commission were represented.
Standing Committee on Administration and Finance
3.	The Commission received SCAF’s advice with respect to the Executive Secretary’s proposal to undertake a review of the 2002 Strategic Plan and report the results of that review to CCAMLR-XXX.
4.	In addition, the Commission endorsed SCAF’s recommendations that an open-ended informal group consider, inter alia, a comprehensive review of the CCAMLR Financial Regulations and, where appropriate, developing draft amendments to the Financial Regulations including drafting of investment principles.
Scientific Committee 
Harvested species
Krill resources
5.	In 2009/10, six Members fished for krill in Subareas 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3 and most of the catch was taken in Subarea 48.1.  The reported catch to 24 October 2010 was 211 180 tonnes1.
6.	The krill fishery in Subarea 48.1 was closed when the catch reached 99% of the trigger level for the subarea (155 000 tonnes).  The catch in Subarea 48.1 was the highest ever recorded in that subarea, and this was the first time that a subarea had been closed because catches had reached one of the apportioned trigger levels introduced in 2009 (Conservation Measure (CM) 51-07).  
7.	Notifications for krill fishing in 2010/11 were received from seven Members covering 15 vessels with a notified total predicted catch of 410 000 tonnes; there was no notification for exploratory krill fisheries.  
8.	The Commission endorsed the Scientific Committee’s advice on the calculation of B0 estimates for krill.  The revised B0 estimate for Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 48.3 and 48.4 was 60.3 million tonnes with a sampling CV of 12.8%, and this represented the best estimate of krill biomass derived from the CCAMLR-2000 Survey.  
9.	The Commission endorsed the Scientific Committee’s revised precautionary catch limit for krill of 5.61 million tonnes for Subareas 48.1 to 48.4 and agreed that this value would be appropriate for a revision of CM 51-01.  The Commission noted that the current trigger level is not linked to the assessment of B0 and would remain at 620 000 tonnes for Subareas 48.1 to 48.4.

10.	The Commission also noted the need to investigate the potential impact of climate change on recruitment variability, and agreed that a full review of the influence of recruitment variability on the calculation of sustainable yield be undertaken.
Toothfish resources
11.	In 2009/10, 11 Members fished for toothfish in Subareas 48.3, 48.4, 48.6, 58.6, 58.7, 88.1 and 88.2 and Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2, 58.4.3b, 58.5.1 and 58.5.2; Japan also conducted research fishing in Divisions 58.4.4a and 58.4.4b.  The reported total catch to 24 September 2010 was 11 860 tonnes2.
Icefish resources
12.	In 2009/10, three Members fished for icefish in Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2 and the catch reported to 24 September 2010 was 378 tonnes3.
Climate change 
13.	The Commission noted the findings of the SCAR Antarctic Climate Change and Environment (ACCE) report and the recommendations of the Scientific Committee on potential responses of CCAMLR to the protection of sites and species that might be particularly vulnerable to climate change.
14.	The Chair of the Scientific Committee noted that, while there was no substantive advice on the issue of climate change at this meeting, it remains an important part of the agenda of the Committee. 
Scientific Committee activities
15.	The Commission noted the important discussions undertaken in the Scientific Committee on its work over the next 2 to 3 years and endorsed the three priority areas of (i) feedback management of the krill fishery, (ii) assessment of toothfish fisheries (especially in exploratory fisheries), and (iii) MPAs and the allocation of tasks to its working groups.
16.	The Commission endorsed the terms of the CCAMLR Scientific Scholarship.  While the scheme should be funded from the General Science Capacity Special Fund, the long-term nature of the scheme was dependent on additional funding from the Commission and Members.
Bottom Fishing
17.	The Commission noted the discussions and advice regarding bottom fishing and VMEs which had been provided by the Scientific Committee which included:
(i)	the development of a glossary of terms and conceptual diagram;
(ii)	consideration of two alternative approaches to defining the term ‘Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem’;
(iii)	estimation of the cumulative impact of bottom longline fishing on benthic communities and VME taxa; 
(iv)	review of preliminary impact assessments provided by Members’ who had notified their intention to participate in exploratory fisheries in 2010/11;
(v)	consideration of VMEs notified in accordance with CM 22-06 and potential encounters with VMEs notified in accordance with CM 22-07;
(vi)	development by WG-FSA of a Report on Bottom Fisheries and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems.

18.	The Commission endorsed the following aspects of the Scientific Committee’s work:
(i)	a glossary of terms and conceptual diagram relevant to the consideration and management of VMEs in the Convention Area;
(ii)	development of advice on precautionary management actions that can be taken to mitigate immediate risks to VMEs without the definition of a VME;
(iii)	revision of CM 22-06, Annex A, in order to facilitate the work on the estimation of the spatial footprint and potential impact of notified fishing activities in forthcoming fishing seasons;
(iv)	inclusion into the VME Register of two new sites which were identified during a fishery-independent trawl survey in Subarea 48.2.
19.	The Commission noted the Scientific Committee’s work plan on VMEs and related matters, most of which was scheduled for 2012 and 2013 and agreed to review CM 22-07 in 2012.
Incidental Mortality of Seabirds and Marine Mammals during Fishing Operations
20.	The Commission noted that even though the Working Group on Incidental Mortality Associated with Fishing (WG-IMAF) had not met this year, it was important to continue to review IMAF-related information.
Marine Protected Areas
21.	The Commission endorsed the terms of reference and potential workshop outputs from an MPA Workshop to be hosted in France in August 2011.  It is proposed the workshop will review progress, share experience on different approaches to the selection of candidate sites for protection, review draft proposals for MPAs in the CAMLR Convention Area and determine a work program for the identification of MPAs in as many of the priority regions as possible.
22.	The Commission endorsed the revised management plan for ASPA No. 149, Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Islands. 
23.	The Commission endorsed the recommendation that the process for designation of an MPA include the development of a research and monitoring program to be conducted within a specified timetable (e.g. 3 to 5 years), and that the development of a designation process and a monitoring plan may proceed in a step-wise fashion or both processes may occur simultaneously.
IUU Fishing in the Convention Area
24.	Seven vessels had been reported to have engaged in IUU fishing in the Convention Area during 2009/10 and all were believed to be using gillnets.
New and Exploratory Fisheries
25.	The Commission noted that WG-FSA and the Scientific Committee had reviewed progress in assessing the exploratory fisheries for Dissostichus spp.  Many of these fisheries were considered to be ‘data-poor exploratory fisheries’ in, for example, Subareas 48.6 and 58.4, because data are currently insufficient to undertake a stock assessment and in some instances this is despite many years of a structured research and tagging program.
Conservation Measures
26.	Conservation measures and resolutions adopted at CCAMLR-XXIX have been published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2010/11 (www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cm/drt.htm). 

Cooperation with other Elements of the Antarctic Treaty System 
Cooperation with Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties 
27.	The Commission noted the discussion in the ATCM with respect to the development of the IMO’s Guidelines for Ships Operating in Polar Waters and encouraged Members to fully engage in this process, as well as in the work of the Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), noting that many areas within the CAMLR Convention Area have not been surveyed to modern standards. 
28.	There were no resolutions or decisions arising from ATCM XXXIII and CEP XIII requiring decisions to be made at  CCAMLR-XXIX, although the Commission noted the adopted Resolution 5 (2010) ‘Coordination Among Antarctic Treaty Parties on Antarctic Proposals under Consideration in the IMO’ and Decision 1 ‘Compilation of Key Documents of the Antarctic Treaty System’. 
Cooperation with SCAR 
29.	The Commission endorsed the terms of reference of a Joint CCAMLR–SCAR Action Group to improve the strategic alliance between the two organisations, noting that this would address objectives of the Commission as well as the Scientific Committee. 
Implementation of Convention Objectives
Performance Review
30.	The Commission determined that the Performance Review should remain a matter for priority attention at future Commission meetings.  The status of the Commission’s considerations of the recommendations arising from the Review is available at   www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/revpanrep.htm.
Election of Chair
31.	The Commission elected Norway as Chair of the Commission from the end of the 2010 meeting until the conclusion of the 2012 meeting. 
Date and location of the next meeting
32.	The Commission agreed that its Thirtieth Meeting will be held from 24 October to 4 November 2011, in Hobart, Australia. 
30th Anniversary of the CAMLR Convention
33. 	7 April 2012 will mark the 30th anniversary for the entry into force of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
