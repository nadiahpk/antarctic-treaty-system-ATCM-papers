The Initial Responses to the Comments on the Draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation for Construction and Operation of the Jang Bogo Antarctic Research Station, 
Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica

Information Paper Submitted by the Republic of Korea


1. Background
On February 15, 2011, the Republic of Korea notified the CEP (Committee for Environmental Protection) Chair that it has presented the draft CEE (Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation) for the “Construction and Operation of the Jang Bogo Station, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica.” The full document is available for download from http://www.kopri.re.kr/english/ and http://www.antarctica.go.kr. In accordance with the “Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs” (Appendix 4 to the CEP X Final Report) an intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) was established to consider the Republic of Korea’s draft CEE. The Republic of Korea very much appreciates the valuable comments made by the parties and would like to provide the initial responses to the comments for consideration in the CEP. 


2. Initial Responses to the comments from ICG participants
The ICG determined that the draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection. ICG participants raised several issues. In particular, the Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestions that the final CEE should provide further details regarding the possible cumulative impacts of activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region; the ancillary station infrastructure; the wastewater treatment system; the management of sewage and food wastes; oil spill prevention; measures to prevent impacts on the skua colony; measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species; and plans for decommissioning the station. 

The Republic of Korea welcomes all the inquires from the participants and has examined the station design closely after the submission of the draft CEE in order to further reduce the impacts on the Antarctic environment caused by the proposed activities. This effort will be continued until finalizing the design and also during operation in the future. As the first step of this effort, an incineration option is discarded for waste treatment and generator capacity is lowered by reducing power requirement. All the waste including food waste and sewage sludge will be removed from Antarctica and total fossil fuel consumption, which will reduce emissions. 

1. Cumulative impacts of activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region

Several participants pointed out that the proposed site for Jang Bogo station is close to existing facilities operated by Germany and Italy. They suggested that the ‘consideration of cumulative impacts for the proposed activity in light of the existing activities and other known planned activities’ (as required under Article 3.2(f) of Annex I) in the final CEE should be expanded to address the potential cumulative impacts associated with the conduct of science and operational activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region. 
    • There are two existing stations in the Terra Nova Bay region: Germany’s Gondwana Station located approximately 1.2 km south and Italy’s Mario Zucchelli Station, 8 km southeast from the proposed site. Both stations are seasonal. The Italian station is being operated only during the summer while the German station is open every other summer.

Cumulative impacts of the operation and maintenance of the stations
in the Terra Nova Bay region
    • Considering the 8 km distance from the Jang Bogo Station, simultaneous operations of the Mario Zucchelli and Jang Bogo Station is not expected to amount to significant cumulative impacts on air quality, water quality, waste accumulation, and other environmental consequences. At Gondwana Station, there are minimum operational facilities.

Cumulative impacts due to research activities
    • Some cumulative impacts are anticipated by research activities that will be performed by the Jang Bogo Station and the existing stations, including marine research, route development, glacial investigation and Browning Pass utilization. Such impacts will be mitigated through cooperative logistic planning of supply and personnel. The impacts can be further reduced by avoiding duplicate research activities in the Terra Nova Bay region. Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) has already started to collaborate with the Italian and German counterparts. Details will be described in the final CEE.



2. Description station infrastructure

Some participants asked that the final CEE should provide further information about the full complement of station infrastructure, including other major structures (e.g. power plant, maintenance facility, storage buildings, emergency shelter, boat storage, scientific facilities, other ancillary station infrastructure (e.g. heliport, antennae), and the site services (e.g. wires, pipe work) that will run between the station facilities.

    • The full complement of infrastructure will be fixed after completing the final design so that the final CEE could include further details and changes if there are any. Also, the draft CEE provides an impact assessment based on current design and the final CEE will include a reassessment if significant changes are made in the final design.


3. Waste water treatment, re-use and discharge
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should describe the water treatment system in greater detail; whether the same system will be used during the construction and operational phases; the percentage of treated water that will be re-used on station, and for what purposes; the volume of effluent to be discharged (daily / annually); the likely quality of the ‘near pollutant-free’ effluent to be discharged; whether the waste treatment plant will require a full-time specialist operator; and what contingency arrangements will be in place if the plant fails.

.
    • The Internal Circulation in a Sequence Batch Reactor(IC-SBR) is to be installed for wastewater treatment and grey water reclamation. The grey water is supplied for toilet flushing and cleaning which account for about 40% of total water use.
    • Wastewater will be treated and discharged based on the most stringent level in Discharged Water Quality Standard of the Republic of Korea described in the draft CEE (page 82). 
    • The IC-SBR is an unattended system so a full-time specialist is unnecessary. It should be monitored regularly by a technician who is given minimal training by the provider. Even though this system is very reliable, sufficient spare parts should be supplied for contingency.
    • Detailed design of the equipment will be described in the final CEE.


4. Management of sewage and food waste
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should provide further information to the Republic of Korea’s plans to incinerate food waste and sewage sludge (Section 2.5.4, page 37), including the likely volume and moisture content of these waste streams; and the method of reducing moisture content (particularly in sewage sludge) to a point where incineration would be efficient and effective.

    • As mentioned earlier KOPRI, the operator of Jang Bogo Station decided to install a ‘food waste reducer’ rather than an incinerator. This equipment reduces the weight and volume of food waste up to 10~15%. All processed food waste is to be removed from Antarctica. It requires low power, no enzyme, no additives and no fresh water during the process. A backup system is prepared for contingency. Details of the system will be included in the final CEE. 


5. Oil spill prevention
Several participants commented that the description of measures to prevent fuel and oil spills (Section 5.3.2, page 78) focuses on spills from the bulk fuel tanks and pipelines connecting facilities on the station. 

    • As a result of a hydrographic survey conducted in February 2011, the detailed hydrographic chart around the proposed site is available. R/V ARAON was able to approach the fuel tank site within 200m. A floating hose and multilayered oil fence are deployed during pumping from the ship to shore. All staff is on standby during the operation and will act immediately and appropriately against an oil spill according to the Jang Bogo Station contingency plan (2011).
    • All fuel tanks are double skinned and appropriately bundled.
    • Draft CEE includes an oil spill contingency plan for ground and coastal operation as well, some detail information about the measures will be added into the final CEE.


6. Measures to prevent impacts to the skua colony
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should provide further information to clarify the predicted impacts on the skua nesting site, and the planned mitigation measures. 

    • One of the overriding principles of the construction project is not to disturb the major nesting site of South Polar Skua mainly in the eastern hill of the Gondwana Station. Both site selection and construction planning were made based on this principle.
    • Flight routes of helicopters were selected to prevent any disturbance to the nesting site during construction and operation. Positive conservation measures, such as access control by personnel other than researchers were included in the draft CEE.
    • As the impact on 3-4 nests located within the proposed site is inevitable, additional protective measures to minimize the impacts, such as installation of barriers, are being considered. This will be added in the final CEE, in addition to those already described in the draft CEE.
    • A monitoring plan for the nesting site was included in the draft CEE. A more detailed and site-specific plan based on the results of the 2011 investigation will be included in the final CEE.


7. Measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should describe in greater detail the mitigation measures to minimise the risk of introduction of non-native species during the operation of the station (Section 5.7.2, page 90) should be described in greater detail in the final CEE. 

    • To prevent the introduction of Non-Native species (NNS) during the construction and operation of the Jang Bogo Station, all people travelling to and working in Antarctica should take note of the CEP Non-native Species Manual provided as CEP XIII WP009 and its Annex. All cargos, provisions, construction vehicles will be treated and supplied according to the measures. Especially, according to the guidelines provided in CEP XIII WP008, it is mandatory to clean all vehicles and compartments before loading under supervision.
    • Unless new, clothing supplied for use in Antarctica will be cleaned using normal laundry procedures prior to arriving in Antarctica. Pre-worn footwear will be cleaned with detergent and brushing on the ship during transit to Antarctica or between sites in Antarctica. Footwear will be similarly cleaned immediately prior to flights.
    • Fresh foods and food wastes will be strictly managed and removed from the Antarctic to prevent them entering the environment.
    • The highly sensitive areas will be designated and monitored. Non-Native species will be recorded, and the records will be submitted to the alien database managed by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre, as agreed in CEP.

8. Decommissioning
Several participants asked to describe more clearly in the final CEE specifically what is expected to be removed from the site and what will be left in place after decommissioning. 

    • When the Jang Bogo Station is dismantled, all building modules, steel frames, and PC foundations of the main building and other facilities are to be removed from Antarctica. All mat foundation mentioned in the draft CEE will be also replaced by PC foundation in the final design.
    • If removing some items from the site is predicted to impact the Antarctic environment more severely rather than left in the place, those items will be left in the site after decommissioning.
    • After the dismantling is completed, the site will be monitored for a certain period of time to ensure minimal impact from the dismantling and determine whether additional measures are needed to recover the site.
