Summary of key features of Antarctic Specially Managed Areas
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
This paper presents a summary of the key features of the seven existing Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, using information drawn from management plans.
Background
Article 4 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty provides for the designation of Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) ‘to assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, improve co-operation between Parties or minimise environmental impacts’. Since the entry into force of Annex V in 2002, the Parties have designated seven ASMAs, each of which has a management plan prepared in accordance with Article 5.3 of Annex V.
This paper presents a summary of the key features of the existing ASMAs, using information drawn from management plans. It is hoped that this will assist the CEP and Parties with discussions regarding existing and possible future ASMAs, particularly during the CEP Workshop on Marine and Terrestrial Antarctic Specially Managed Areas to be held in Montevideo on 16-17 June 2011.

Overall aim and objectives
To avoid or to reduce the risk of mutual interference and minimize environmental impacts, thus providing an effective mechanism for the conservation of the valuable features that characterize the area
To manage and coordinate human activities in the Area such that the values of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are protected in the long term. 
To assist in planning and co-ordinating current and future activities in the Area, to avoid possible conflicts, and to improve co-operation between Parties in order to avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area. 
To conserve and protect the unique and outstanding environment of Deception Island, whilst managing the variety of competing demands placed upon it, including science, tourism, and the conservation of its natural and historic values. To protect the safety of those working on, or visiting the island. 
To coordinate activities in the Area such that the scientific and environmental values of the Area can be sustained indefinitely, and the historical values preserved to the greatest extent practicable.
To protect the environment by promoting coordination and cooperation by Parties in the planning and conduct of all human activities in the Area.
To conserve and protect the unique and outstanding environment of the southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin region by managing the variety of activities and interests in the Area. To ensure that these important values are protected and sustained in the long-term, especially the extensive scientific data sets collected over the last 100 years.
