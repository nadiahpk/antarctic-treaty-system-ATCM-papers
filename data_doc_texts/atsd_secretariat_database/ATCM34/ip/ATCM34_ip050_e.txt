Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (updated 2011)




Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment (updated 2011)
CEP Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and Uruguay

    1. At ATCM XXXIII (2010) the United Kingdom submitted IP 42: Colonisation status of known non-native species in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.  However, in the last year, there have been: 
    • significant developments in the colonisation status of some of the non-native species described previously and 
    • non-native species reported at new locations.  
    2. Information relating to these developments has been added to the existing information and is shown in Table 1 in bold.
    3. To the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made to eradicate any of the known non-native species in the past year.  Nevertheless, eradication of non-native plants reported from several locations may require minimal amounts of effort, particularly where plant numbers are low or the area of coverage is small.

Plants







Poa annua
Arctowski Station, King George Island, South Shetland Islands
1985/86
Expanding
Grass has spread over 500 m into the vicinity of the nearby ASPA 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, and 1.5 km to the deglaciated foreground of Ecology Glacier (c. 70 individuals in an area of ~100 m2) 
1985/86: first found in metal grating at Arctowski Station main building 
1990: spread to greenhouse area and above subterranean hot water pipes within a single area of c. 0.4 km2 1991/92: found in a number of locations with disturbed ground 2005/6: found growing amongst indigenous plant communities for the first time.                                          
2008/9: found on a glacier forefield, 1.5 km from the station

Poa pratensis
Primavera Station, Cierva Point, Palmer Archipelago, Antarctic Peninsula
1954/55
Persistent (?)
In 1995 the grass was limited to an area  c. 40 cm across, possibly because the micro-climatic is unsuitable for growth outside this restricted area.
