Ukraine policy regarding visits by tourists to Vernadsky station
Information Paper, presented by Ukraine
Summary 
In pursuance of the previous ATCM recommendations (XXXIII Final Report, points 242-148) Ukraine is presenting for Parties’ consideration Ukraine policy regarding visits by tourists and nongovernmental expeditions to Vernadsky station. This policy was revised in March 2011 and now it clearly states the level of availability of infrastructure and personnel to cater for tourism activities. Attached to this document are policies relating to visitors at the station prepared in a format of Visitor Site Guidelines, facilitating tourist vessel expedition crew comprehension and use. 
The priorities of activity at Vernadsky Station 
Scientific research has a priority in relation to all non-governmental activities at the station as the ATCM Resolution 7 (2009) is required. It means that tourist visits are strictly prohibited in the following cases: 
    • during change of winterers team, and while a supply ship is discharging cargo; 
    • in all other cases, when such visits can disturb station work schedules and/or planned research activity going on directly at the station or at adjoining experimental study sites, field camps and supplies.
To help maintain best practice within the Antarctic tourism industry, Ukraine National Antarctic Program prefers, on a priority basis, to accept requests for tour ship visits from full members of IAATO as this association maintains and enforces responsible bylaws and guidelines on them. 
The station personnel provide facilities for basic hospitality as well as for education the public about environmental protection in Antarctica and progress of the National Antarctic Program (as it is accepted at the some stations). Medical and other humanitarian assistance is possible in emergency only.
The Guidelines for visitors were developed and approved in accordance with national standards of paperwork. The extract from the Guidelines is presenting for Parties’ consideration in a format of the Visitor Site Guidelines, facilitating tourist vessel expedition crew comprehension and use (see the attachment to this Paper). A copy of these Guidelines will be available on official web site of the Ukraine National Antarctic Program, in order to ensure a broader access to them. 
Alternative to tourist activity at Vernadsky Station 
Ukraine National Antarctic Program reserves the right to revise its policy to prevent environmental impact and avoid interference with scientific investigations and station work schedules. Such Guidelines may include more restrictions on access, number of visitors and time ashore, in view of the observed high number of visitors and spatial trends in ship-borne tourism in the station area.
As preferred alternative to further development of Antarctic tourism at the station, the leadership of the Ukraine National Antarctic Program considers a possibility to encourage scientific tourism (business travels) by means of establishing a training and scientific centre at Vernadsky station, in order to hold an international workshops and summer field school. For instance, such centre makes a good progress at Russian Bellingshausen station since 2008 (XXXIII ATCM Information Paper No 89). The most essential prerequisites for holding such centre at Vernadsky station are the following:
    • representative sites which play a key role in regional eco-system processes (e.g., Petermann Island is one of the best place for field camp);
    • well-developed station infrastructure allows accommodation up to 10-15 participants;
    • transport accessibility by regular cruise ships;
    • well-know Historic site managed by Vernadsky station personnel (Base F, “Wordie House” on Winter Island).
Operation of such training and scientific centre based on existing infrastructure during summer season will allow Ukraine to implement more active provisions and principles of the Antarctic Treaty, first of all to assist international scientific collaboration.
