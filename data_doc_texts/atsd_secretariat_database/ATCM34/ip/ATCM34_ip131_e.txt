Deception Island Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management Group Report
Joint Information Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, the UK and the USA

1. Introduction
Deception Island was formally adopted as Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 4 by Measure 3 (2005). Working Paper XXVIII ATCM/WP 20 and Information Papers XII SATCM/IP8, XXIV ATCM/IP63, XXV ATCM/IP28 and XXVI ATCM/IP48 summarise the extensive consultation amongst those Parties with major interests in Deception Island, and the process that lead to its adoption as an ASMA.
Following the formal adoption of ASMA No. 4, XXIX ATCM/IP19, and subsequent IPs, reported on the establishment of a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the plan and on the success of the Deception Island Management Group to effectively resolve the previously reported conflicts between science and tourism. 
At XXX ATCM, IP108, ATCM XXXI, IP126, ATCM XXXII IP112 , ATCM XXXIII IP 16 gave an overview of the activities undertaken on Deception Island during the 2006/2007 to 2009/2010 austral summers, and informed the Meeting of the planned intersessional work that the Management Group were considering.  
The present Information Paper is a summary of the activities undertaken within the Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), and the work of the Management Group to fulfil the objectives and principles of ASMA No. 4 Management Plan during the intersessional period (2010-2011).  
The Management Group is currently undertaking a comprehensive revision of the Deception Island management package of measures approved in 2005.

2.  Overview of Activities 2010/11

2.1 Science and Logistics

The Spanish Antarctic Base Gabriel de Castilla, operated by the Spanish Army, was opened from December 19th, 2010 to March 7th, 2011. During the Antarctic campaign, Gabriel de Castilla operated at full capacity and a refurbishment project was completed which aimed to decrease the environmental impact of the station. Steps taken include the installation of renewable energies, replacement of old containers for new ones with lower energy requirements, improvements in the safety and storage capacity of fuel and improved science support capacity. The base has obtained the certificate of the International Organization Standardization ISO 14001.

During the 2010/2011 Antarctic campaign, nine Spanish scientific projects were developed at Gabriel de Castilla Base:

    • Health status of Phocids and Otarids in the Antarctic Peninsula: impact of human activity and latitudinal gradient influence. 
    • Geodetic and geothermal research, time serial analysis and volcanic innovation in Antarctica (South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula) (GEOTINANT). 
    • Thermal state of permafrost and active layer evolution in the TSP and CALM-S network stations on Livingston and Deception islands (Antarctica) (PERMAPLANET). 
    • Start-up and development of a long-term monitoring system for human impact in Deception Island.
    • The role of chemical signals in inter- and intra-specific relationships in Antarctic penguins: Food detection and social communication.
    • Maintenance of broadband seismic stations in the South Shetland Islands (Antarctica) for crustal structure analyses. 
    • Monitoring the seismo-volcanic activity at Deception Island (South Shetland, Antarctica). 
    • Revision of the structure and volcanology of the Deception Island caldera. 
    • Ecological effects of stranded macroalgal wrack in the intertidal sedimentary shores of Port Foster, Deception Island. 
In addition to these projects, works was undertaken in other areas including telecommunications, field support and outreach (e.g. regular video conferences with Spain). 

Argentine researchers worked in Base Decepcion from December 26th, 2010 to February 18th, 2011. Fieldwork was done on volcanic seismology and gas geochemistry. Geological studies on modern pyroclastic cones were also undertaken. Research and monitoring activities on permafrost associated to active volcanic regions, have been initiated during this summer campaign. 

Chile, with the support of the Spanish Antarctic Program, developed scientific activities mainly in Fumarola and Telefon Bays area, collecting sediment, ice, snow and water samples. Four scientists stayed in Gabriel de Castilla Station in January 2011 to conclude the field activities of the project “Antarctica: Source of biological resources”.  

The United States scientific activities within the ASMA were limited to two visits to the Baily Head chinstrap penguin colony and three visits to both Whaler’s Bay and Entrance Point by the Antarctic Site Inventory Project. The work was a continuation of a project designed to document long-term ecosystem changes in Antarctic Peninsula, with a focus on seabird populations.

2.2 Tourist Activities

During the 2010/11 season Deception Island received a total of 198 landings from IAATO member vessels between the period of 23 October, 2010 and 18 March 2011 (148 days). This total number of visits accounts for 119 landings at Whalers Bay, 40 landings at Telefon Bay, 24 landings at Pendulum Cove, 13 landings at Baily Head and 2 landings to Fumarole Bay.  During this period there were 49 days where more than one visit took place. These occurred either as multiple visits from one vessel or separate visits from separate vessels. These figures do not include landings from non-IAATO yachts. 

In February 2011, Chile supported an activity of four national swimmers, whom cross Port Foster no affecting other activities in the area. The group reached Deception Island on board the Chilean Icebreaker “Oscar Viel” and stayed there for around 4 hours.

3. Inter-sessional work (2010-2011)
Chairmanship

The Deception Island Management Group under the Terms of Reference of the Management Group, decided that Chairmanship of the group shall rotate every two years among the six member Parties. 

United Kingdom and Argentina has completed their two years and Spain is going to finish its Chairmanship in the next ATCM at Buenos Aires (2011) where it will have to be decided which Party shall hold these responsibilities next.

Work plan

Following an informal meeting during the ATCM XXXIII at Punta del Este (2010), the management group set the work plan and assigned different sections of the management plan for review based upon Party/group member’s priorities and expertise:

The following provides a status of the progress of this work plan:

    • Maps: US and UK will update relevant overall maps, although management plan maps may be revised by proponents 
    • ASPA No. 145 Port Foster. Chile will revise, taking into account the UK’s comments
    • ASPA No. 140 Parts of Deception Islands.   ASPA 140 is being revised by the UK and will be submitted to ATCM XXXIV.
    • Whalers Bay Conservation Strategy. Norway, Chile and UK are in the process reviewing the strategy, considering the need for revisions.
    • Visitors Site Code of Conduct. Management group, IAATO and ASOC will work together to examine and revise guidelines, including Bailey Head. Whalers Bay visitor site guidelines are being revised and will submitted to ATCM XXXIV
    • Facilities Zone Code of Conduct. Argentina and Spain are working together to draft a proposal.
    • Volcanic Alert and Escape. Argentina and Spain are working together to draft a proposal. It is considered that the existing text needs to be fully revised, taking into consideration recent knowledge on Deception Island and including more detailed information about all the possible evacuation routes in a volcanic emergency and recommending, for safety reasons, the need for a permanent or seasonal instrumental display in the island to detect the level of volcanic risk.
    • Management Plan. Spain with the support of the management group. Spain has as a first step submitted a proposed draft revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Managed Area, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.

The UK indicated that it would be useful to have year-round seismic monitoring on Deception Island. Spain informed the Management Group that they were examining the possibility of establishing a year-round volcanic observatory on the island.  Currently, there is monitoring only during the austral summer when Gabriel de Castilla station is operational. Any action concerning about the observatory would be done in cooperation with Argentina.

The management Group has noted that several potentially challenging issues could arise during the revision of the management plan. Specifically the following issues have surfaced and will be discussed further in the group:

- Shipping restrictions. The group has discussed issues relating to shipping restrictions, recognizing that restricting shipping could present some legal issues. 

Bailey Head. Spain has expressed its concern related with Bailey Head that has the largest Chinstrap penguin rookery in Deception Island and one of the largest in Antarctica.  The main problem in this area is the high number of penguins walking from the colonies to the sea or from the sea to the colonies. It has been observed that there has been a decrease in the population which may require some changes to, or strengthening of, the protection and management of this zone. Taking into account all these facts Spain considered that it would be necessary to significantly reduce the number of visitors. It has, however, been recognized that any such proposals will require further discussion by the Management Group.”

3. Conclusions

The Management Group will consider whether further measures are required to protect the important natural values of Deception Island, and to support the implementation of the Management Plan for the Deception Island ASMA No. 4.
