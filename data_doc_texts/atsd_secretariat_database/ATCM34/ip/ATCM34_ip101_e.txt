Russian proposals on the International Polar Decade Initiative
During the period 1 March 2007 to 31 March 2009, activities of the International Polar Year 2007-2008 (IPY) were carried out in the Arctic and the Antarctic. The IPY has become an outstanding event in the international scientific community. This project was implemented under the aegis of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the International Council for Science (ICSU). Studies carried out in the framework of this program made it possible to once again join efforts of many countries in the study of polar regions, which influence significantly the development of different natural processes and social issues of the peoples inhabiting these Earth’s areas. The idea of organizing the International Polar Decade (IPD) was voiced even before the official end of the IPY Program in June 2008 at the 60th session of the WMO Executive Council. 
It was supported by 40 members of the WMO Executive Council representing the leading countries of all world regions. In July 2008, the SCAR/IASC IPY Open Science Conference “Polar research – Arctic and Antarctic perspectives in the International Polar Year” was held in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Declaration of the Conference also outlined the perspective of further development of international cooperation in the Earth’s polar regions in the framework of the IPD projects. This proposal was later supported in the Ministerial Declaration of the Arctic Council (Tromso, Norway, 2009) and by the ICSU/WMO Joint Committee on the International Polar Year 2007-2008 (Oslo, 2010).
The results of the studies carried out under the IPY 2007/2008 Program serve as an incentive for holding the IPD. This program has become a true international interdisciplinary undertaking consisting of more than 160 international research projects based on proposals of more than 60 countries. Most of the scientific projects were implemented in the Arctic due to the increased interest of the international community in this region after the end of the “cold war” period and in its mineral and hydrocarbon potential. 
Complexity of the Earth’s system structure requires an interdisciplinary approach to its study, necessary to improve our understanding and to increase the quality of natural and social predictions for the future.
The scientific program of IPY 2007-2008 differed significantly from the programs of previous IPYs and other programs of large-scale scientific research in the polar regions. Dozens of the IPY projects were oriented to studies in the field of social science and special efforts were undertaken to include interdisciplinary studies and projects, synthesizing knowledge from different areas of science to the IPY 2007-2008.
As emphasized in the Statement of ICSU/WMO Joint Committee “State of Polar Research”, “for the first time in the history of IPY/IGY, physical, natural, social and humanistic scientists worked together under a common multidisciplinary science program. This new form of cross-disciplinary collaboration is widely perceived as a lasting achievement of the IPY. It marks an extraordinary advance in our vision of the complexities of the polar regions, and of the importance of synthesis, knowledge integration and data sharing in the understanding of processes that affect our planet”.
 A fundamental outcome of IPY 2007-2008 was collection of a large volume of new knowledge about ongoing significant changes of natural conditions of the polar regions. The results of the studies have proved the need for conducting longer continuous studies of the processes determining the environmental changes of polar regions at the decadal scale.
Analysis of the major results of the IPY 2007-2008 has allowed us to define global and regional prerequisites for arranging new international longer-term studies to be implemented in the IPD framework. In the opinion of Russian experts, the former include: 
    • influence of the polar regions on planetary climatic processes in the atmosphere, ocean and cryosphere;
    • development of the world marine fishery requirements, including use of biological resources of the polar oceans and seas, primarily of the Southern Ocean. 
The regional preconditions include an assessment of the temporal variability rates of natural processes in both polar regions, increase in the number of unfavorable weather phenomena and ecosystem disturbances, threatening the traditional lifestyle of the indigenous peoples, nature use, functioning of life support systems and other activity.
Existing differences in the geographic, economical, political, demographic and military-strategic conditions between the Arctic and the Antarctic change the focus of scientific studies in these regions under a possible IPD program. 
The proposed IPD mission is to provide warnings and prevent the climatic, ecological and biosphere catastrophes based on monitoring and investigation of interaction of different environmental components; enhance life quality of the population in the Arctic region; improve the scientific basis to ensure balance of state interests of the countries operating in the polar regions.
The IPD aim is to monitor and investigate critical changes in the Earth’s polar regions influencing the climatic system of the planet, ecosystems and the life quality of the population and to work out recommendations for governmental and non-governmental organizations operating in the Arctic and the Antarctic.
	The following IPD objectives are proposed: 
    1) Long-term monitoring of the changing state of polar regions based on available technologies and development of current observation facilities, integration of the meteorological, oceanographic, hydrological, cryospheric, social-economic and other observation systems and information resources related to the polar regions.
    2) Study of large-scale and local changes in the climatic system and the environmental state in the polar regions and their role in global climate processes.
    3) Increase of efficiency of forecasting dangerous hydrometeorological and natural phenomena in the polar regions, development and establishment of the systems of hydrometeorological security for the population and territories from dangerous natural phenomena.
    4) Study of the geological structure and the geological history for investigating long-term climatic (paleoclimatic) change of the Arctic Basin and the Antarctic, including marine basins surrounding it and for data collection.
    5) Assessment of the ecological state of the environment in the polar regions and development of measures to decrease the adverse consequences of its pollution for man and ecosystems.
    6) Assessment of the impact of changes in the climatic system and the environmental state in the polar regions for social-economic and natural complexes of the country and development of adaptive measures.
    7) Increase of the level of educational and scientific potential in the area of polar studies and spread of knowledge among wide public.
The aforementioned proposals were considered and approved at the session of the Marine Board of the Government of the Russian Federation. 
Obviously in considering a possibility of launching a new international program of polar studies in the IPD framework, other proposals of potential participants of this program should be taken into account. In order to assess the perspectives of implementing the IPD Program, a workshop on “International Polar Decade Initiative” was held on 14-15 April 2011 in St. Petersburg. The WMO and the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Russia) were organizers of the workshop. The workshop was attended by 49 specialists from Belgium, Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Russia, the USA, Finland, France, Sweden and Switzerland. Besides, among participants there were officers of the following international organizations: the European Environment Agency, the European Science Foundation, the International Arctic Science Committee, the International Arctic Social Science Association, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program, the WMO Secretariat and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. The workshop participants worked in a personal capacity and their contributions were not expected to reflect the position of their respective governments and organizations.
On the first day, workshop participants considered:
    • structure, results and legacies of the IPY 2007-2008; 
    • scientific, practical and societal problems of the polar regions; 
    • role of polar climate in global climatic processes;
    • current capabilities of polar weather forecasting and climate prediction; 
    • existing and emerging observing systems in the polar regions;
    • Arctic air pollution; 
    • contaminants influence on human health in the Arctic;  
    • perspectives from indigenous and local communities in relation to “Opening of the Arctic”;
    • role of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica in global climate change; 
    • threats to Southern Ocean biodiversity, 
    • social processes in relation to peoples, societies and cultures in the polar regions, 
    • education, outreach and new generation of polar researchers, 
    • coordination and resource mobilization of national, regional and international scientific studies, 
    • the IPD Initiative funding potentials.

In addition to discussing the IPy results and perspectives of new studies, the participants considered the experience of international scientific cooperation, joint financing of research, the implemented investment projects and the improved data observation networks.
The workshop participants have analyzed the differences between the IPY and the IPD. The former presented a “snapshot” in time reaffirming or establishing new scientific baseline for understanding natural and social processes. An IPD would serve to more focused analysis of the existing natural and social processes with the aim of their further prediction. There were also concerns on IPD timing due to a lack of understanding of appropriate mechanisms for financing this program. It was suggested that the IPD could start not earlier than 2014-2015.
On the second day of the workshop, possible IPD scopes were discussed. It was facilitated through three breakout groups where participants discussed:
    • existing science challenges in polar regions and possible objectives of IPD;
    • IPY achievements and legacies and how to use them in the IPD program;
    • potential stakeholders, possible structure, organization and governance of this program. 
Based on the results of the workshop and taking into account the discussions in the breakout groups, the organizers of the workshop have prepared a Report that was disseminated among its participants. This Report was also circulated via the COMNAP information network to all participants of this international organization. 
The 16th World Meteorological Congress (16 May - 3 June 2011, Geneva) will provide an early opportunity to make assessments and gage the interests of governments in perspectives of holding the IPD. The WMO EC Panel on Polar Observations, Research and Services will present the findings of the St. Petersburg workshop to the Congress. On 12 May 2011, the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting will be held in Nuuk, Greenland, where it is also planned to present the workshop materials on the IPD Initiative. It is supposed that other international organizations including COMNAP, SCAR, CEP and CCAMLR and later the ATCM will also provide their suggestions and comments on the possibilities of establishing this program. The draft Program will be developed in the course of consultations and final documents prepared in different international organizations. 
A critical milestone would be the Montreal 2012 IPY Conference “From knowledge to action”, where the IPY comprehensive results will be reviewed. The next 6-12 months should be used to ensure an open dialogue with all potential stakeholders in an International Polar Decade Initiative.
