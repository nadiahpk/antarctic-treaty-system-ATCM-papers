The historical development of McMurdo Station, Antarctica, an environmental perspective 
Introduction
The United States Antarctic Program (USAP) aims to conduct science and operations in a way that has as minimal an impact on the Antarctic environment as practicable.  Consistent with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the USAP also seeks to undertake “regular and effective monitoring . . . to allow assessment of the impacts of ongoing activities, including the verification of predicted impacts” and “facilitate early detection of the possible unforeseen effects of activities.”  To meet both of these goals, the National Science Foundation has funded a long-term monitoring program that examines the impacts of science and logistics at McMurdo Station, Antarctica’s largest scientific base.  The United States feels that the attached paper, which reports on these monitoring efforts, would be of interest to ATCMXXXIV and CEPXII.  This paper by Texas A&M University, published in Polar Geography in 2008, examines the spatial pattern of the development of McMurdo Station.

Using aerial photographs taken between 1956 and 2005, researchers identified areas where the ground surface has been visibly altered by anthropogenic activities (e.g., roads, buildings, disappearance of the original periglacial microrelief pattern of polygons).  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses of historic and current aerial photographs have shown that most of the disturbance of physical surfaces on land (i.e. the creation of the station’s physical footprint) occurred during the early years of the station’s history and the footprint has not expanded much since the 1970’s.

From a management perspective, these data are useful for 

    • Placing observed environmental impacts in their historical perspective;
    • Providing an understanding of the current state of the environment around McMurdo Station;
    • Assessing station design elements; and
    • Informing monitoring efforts elsewhere in Antarctica.
