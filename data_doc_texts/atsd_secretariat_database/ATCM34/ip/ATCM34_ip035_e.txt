Environmental Monitoring and Ecological Activities in Antarctica
2010-2012

Among the preoccupations and scientific activities within the Romanian Polar Research, we mention some studies on polar climate and modifications of polar terrestrial/aquatic bio/ecosystem characteristics and biodiversity as consequences of climate changes.
The research will focus on climate change consequences in both polar area bio/ecosystems, to ascertain the rates/magnitude of impact and the system adaptation/modification, by generating knowledge on polar microclimate, pedobiology, limnology and adaptation mechanisms in extreme environments. 
An analysis of ecosystem structure/responses to climate changes, to preserve the genetic and ecosystem structure information of endangered environments and reveal the modification trends will also be carried out. 
These environmental monitoring and research activities will be performed, among other projects, within a European and International Joint Research Project INTERHEMISPHERE - an interdisciplinary bipolar project involving 12 countries. (Australia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, India, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Spain and Ukraine, coordinated by Romania, Romanian Polar Research Institute. 
Field research will be performed in the Arctic (Greenland, Northern Siberia, and Svalbard) and West and East-Antarctica, aiming to integrate polar research performed by its Consortium partners in the context of interhemispheric comparative studies/models. 
The principal scientific objectives of the joint research project consist of the following elements: 
Polar microbiology/microbial ecology (9 countries)
-Microbial organism/community characterization, complex estimation of climate factors influence on structure and function of polar extremophiles microbial communities, establishing determining factors in biological activity/adaptation in polar environment. 
-Establishing strain collections and a metagenomic data base, representing the genetic information found in polar microorganisms (terrestrial/aquatic, ikaite included) 
Permafrost and polar pedobiology (2 countries)
Pedobiochemical characterization of the terrestrial crust evolution stage (soil vital/enzymic potential) in polar areas; identification of a soil formation pattern in certain polar sites, as a reference in quantifying the terrestrial crust transformation towards soil under global warming. 
Vegetation (3 countries)
Structure and function of Antarctic oasis and Arctic tundra vegetation in response to polar climate; pathways of macroalgal organic matter in polar food web; polar algae biodiversity.  
 Polar ecology (7 countries)
Environment physico-chemical characterization, microclimate monitoring;  
Clarifying the active layer and upper permafrost role in transformations/movement of solutes (nutrients) in catchments of (sub)polar lakes; 
Understanding the climate change effects on aquatic ecology by N2O biogeochemical flux measurements in the Arctic
Studies of ecophysiology (primary production/respiration in soil/water), eecological interactions, bbiodiversity; 
Environmental diagnostics and biomass monitoring with biosensors. 

Ecological monitoring
The interhemispheric comparisons of climate changes in a number of locations in Arctic and Antarctic regions will be valuable for gaining new data points and integrating observations with a broad spatial and regime coverage.  This will enable the monitoring of more polar ecosystem parameters; obtainment of databases with higher spatial/temporal resolutions; databases for interdisciplinary research in international cooperation/programs, for realist models/scenarios regarding polar ecosystems under global climate changes; elaboration of  a some methodology of ecosystems research/control; creating a more dense net of environmental/climate measuring points, to be used in long-term trend analysis and prognosis of local/regional climate and its effects on biological/ecological processes. 
The JRP partners will operate and collaborate as follows: Australia, India, Italy, Estonia, Romania, Russia, and Spain will work together in Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher Oasis (East Antarctica) and Svalbard, Ny Alesund; Bulgaria, Russia and Romania in Hasswell Archipelago; Czech Republic in Antarctic Peninsula and Spitsbergen, in Czech stations with Spain; Denmark in Ikka Fjord in SW-Greenland and with Romania in their laboratories; Estonia in Kilpisjärvi Station, NW-Finnish Lapland, and India, Romania in Larsemann Hills; Italy; Poland in Antarctica (Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Archipelago) and Arctica (Hornsund, Svalbard), own stations and ships; Russian Federation – in the Arctic and Antarctica, own logistics; Spain-in 4 different stations of different JRP partners, and Byers Peninsula/Deception Island with Spanish logistics; Ukraine and Romania will jointly work in microbiological research, in their own facilities; Australia will provide consulting/training on polar microbiology.   
The results of the project will be monitored by the European Science Foundation-European Polar Board.
