ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR OF THE EXPEDITION PARTICIPANTS AND VISITORS TO THE BULGARIAN BASE IN ANTARCTICA 



BULGARIAN ANTARCTIC INSTITUTE 




Why it is necessary to protect Antarctica?

Antarctica, the area south of 60 degrees south latitude covered by the Antarctic Treaty, is the largest and still virgin region on our planet.  The large distances between Antarctica and the other continents, the extremely stormy Southern Ocean, and the extreme weather conditions have been a barrier to intensive human presence.  However, the number of researchers and tourist visitors has increased in recent decades.

The surface area of Antarctica is some 13 million square kilometers (in comparison, Europe is some 10 million square kilometers).  The polar ice cap of Antarctica with an average thickness of more than 2000 m constitutes 90 % of the ice mass on the planet, and thus is the largest reservoir of fresh water on the Earth.  Ice sheets form a unique archive of the climate’s history. 









The dark layers in the glaciers of Livingston Island are formed as a result of volcanic eruptions on nearby Deception Island.

The climate conditions of Antarctica are extremely severe.  The average temperature there is about – 55 degrees centigrade.  Livingston Island is situated in the zone of influence of the polar front of the Southern Hemisphere.  The location of the Island in the ocean determinates its maritime climate, relatively mild for the Antarctic conditions.  Meteorological conditions of the Island are changing frequently and rapidly, rainfalls are high, the winds are strong and mostly western.

Livingston Island is the second largest island of the South Shetland Islands group.  Its area is 798 square kilometers (73 kilometers long and 36 kilometers wide). 

The Antarctic climate determinates a very short summer (from November to February), during which is the vegetation period and the reproduction season for many species.  Local flora and fauna have adopted in surprising and diverse ways to these extreme conditions.  Consequently, the fragile environment is on the verge of survival, and human presence on the continent has an additional negative impact on that state.  Many plant and animal species are endemic to Antarctica.
In recent years, the number of visits by tourist has increased significantly.

Human activities (walking, transportation, pollution or even destruction of habitats) contribute to the reduction of the areas occupied by local vegetation.

Another factor that affects the populations of many animal species is the global warming.  For example, according to research by Friderich Schiller, University of Yena, there has been a steady decrease of the number of Adeli penguin communities during the last decade.  While1516 couples were counted ay one location in the 1993/94 season; their number was only 334 couples in 2006.  This reduction reflects a general trend for all species.

What is done to protect Antarctica?

Based on the unique and pristine environment and ecological system in Antarctica, there are lots of efforts made for their protection. 

In 1959, 12 countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in Washington.  The Treaty designates the region south of 60 degrees south latitude as an area of peace, international cooperation, and scientific research.  For the first time, the requirements to the human activities of the continent were regulated, and the existing territorial claims were put aside. 

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty signed in Madrid in 1991 appends the Treaty of Washington.  So far, 46 countries have signed the Protocol, including Bulgaria which is a consultative party to the Treaty.  Only 28 countries with this status have the privilege and the responsibility to take part in the decision making.  The Madrid Protocol sets out the principles, methods and the obligations concerning the protection of the Antarctic environment and ecological systems pertaining to it. 

What does this means to me as an expedition member or visitor/tourist?

The following guidelines are based on the recommendations for the protection of fauna and flora adopted at the XVIII meeting of the consultative countries. (Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, ATCM, Kyoto 1994, Recommendation XVIII-1).

The Antarctic Institute asks all of you to take these recommendations to heart and do your best to prevent damages to the environment, flora and fauna in Antarctica. 

The main purpose of the recommendations of the Antarctic Institute is to ensure that expedition participants and visitors are well informed and comply with the Treaty and the Protocol. 

Protection of wildlife

Due to the unique adaptation to the extreme ecological conditions, the Antarctic flora and fauna could hardly survive changes in the environment.  Their sensitivity to disturbance compared to that in other regions on the world is much larger. 

The population of particular species has declined dramatically due to seal hunting and whaling that lasted over a century in the past.  Today in Antarctica it is prohibited to touch, take, injure, or kill penguins and other birds, seals and whales.  Any activity involving noise, approaching, stepping over etc. is also prohibited because it leads to negative impact on the flora and fauna, too.  In order to preserve the unique environment, it is also prohibited to remove or relocate animals and plants, or to import alien species.  Singular exceptions for scientific purposes are authorized by special permits.

Protection of special conservation areas, historical places and monuments, as well as scientific research

Together with the special attention, which each participant in an expedition or visitor is obligated to show to the sensitive environment of Antarctica; he/she is expected to respect and the scientific and cultural activities as well as to preserve the historical heritage.  A number of areas in Antarctica are strictly protected, and are accessible only with special permits. 

The existing numerous artifacts from the time of early explorers can be preserved for the future generations only with much care and respect, too. 

Antarctica is of a great importance for the scientific explanation of the global past ant future of the environment.  According to the Protocol on Environmental Protection, scientific research comes first.

The 10 rules:




Rule 1: Keep silence!

*  Use motor vehicles (boats, ski-doos, helicopters etc.) in a way not to disturb fauna, both on land or in the water.
*  Do not use weapons or explosives.  Noise levels should be reduced to minimum in order not to frighten animals.
(Recomm. XVIII-1)

Low flights of helicopters over animal colonies can cause mass panic migrations.  Frequent tourist visits can also have a negative impact.  An example is Cape Royds, where the frequent tourist visits and low flying helicopters resulted in the reduction of the local Adeli penguin colony.

Another example is the Polish Antarctic base Arctowski.  The southern giant petrel left for two years their breeding sites following the installation of fuel tanks in the area; three Papua penguin colonies left the place, too.  These are but few examples of the sensitivity of the animals to external disturbance.

It is not just the noise of helicopters and land vehicles that causes animal anxiety.  Approaching by motor boats disturbs whales and swimming seals, and the the risks of injuring them by engine propellers is high.  So keep your distance from the whales, seals and other marine anmals.

Rule 2: Keep distance!

*  Do not feed or touch birds and seals.  It is forbidden to approach or photograph the animals in a way which will cause a change in their behavior.  A special care and attention should be paid during the period of animals' breeding or while they are changing their feathers.
*  Keep a safe distance on land and sea to all kinds of animals and plants.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

Animals in Antarctica are wild and are not accustomed to human presence.  They can often feel frightened or threatened.  Be careful not to cause any change in their behavior. 

  Animals always have priority!
  Do not stand in the escape way of the animals to the water!
  Stay on the periphery of the animal colonies!
  Do not surround the animals!
  Stay at a safe distance from animals in water or on land!

A particular attention should be paid to breeding birds, animals with their babies or during the period when they change their feathers.  Feeding and touching the animals is forbidden because it causes changes in their behavior with all the accompanying negative consequences.













"Good relationship " with the skua which carries great dangers

The summer season coincides with the period of incubation, hatching, birth and rearing for a lot of animal species.  A number of attractive places inhabited by numerous animals are frequently visited by tourists, which increases the risks of environmental damage.  For instance, the giant petrels react with great sensitivity to human presence, often abandoning their nests and leaving the young birds unprotected against the cold weather or from attacks by skuas, which endangers the population of the entire bird colony.  Disturbing sea elephants during breastfeeding may inhibit lactation and interrupt the feeding of baby seals.  Should this happen several times during the first three weeks after birth, the underfed young seals take to the water where their chances of survival decrease significantly.

Penguins are quite curious.  It happened that penguins jump into a motor boat with working boat engine.  If it happens that a penguin approaches closer than recommended, please do not touch it in spite of its apparent trust.

Keeping distance from the animals is also important for your safety.  Leopard seals and the Antarctic fur seals may attack you and inflict serious injuries.

What are the indications that we are disturbing wildlife?

An unequivocal sign that we are disturbing the seals is that they rise their heads.  While the Antarctic tern and the Dominican seagull issue warning screams, skuas may actually attack humans.  Penguins and other birds stop their eggs incubating when they feel threatened.

It is difficult for a non-expert to determine when and under what conditions (season, period of breeding, period of rising babies, geographical region) the animals may feel threatened, and what the necessary distance to keep is.  The sensitivity of different species varies considerably, so that it is hard to determine common regulations for the distances.  Penguins, who reside in areas with frequent human presence can be easily inveigled to come closer without fear.  On the other side, that calm behavior should not be wrongly interpreted because the research shows that any human approaching to the penguins leads to hormonal stress and increased heart rate frequency.

According to relevant scientific studies the following minimum distances are recommended: 


0 meters - 

5 meters – Seals, penguins

10 meters – nesting penguins

15 meters – seals with their pups, sea birds, Antarctic fur seal

30 meters – Emperor penguin 

50 meters – Giant petrel 



Regardless these recommended minimum distances, if you notice that the animals change their behavior, you should walk away immediately!


Rule 3: Do not step on!

*  Do not destroy or harm the plants , for example by savaging or using motor vehicles on moss fields or rock terrain covered by lichens.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

The plants in Antarctica are subject to highly extreme climate conditions, and have a very short vegetation period.  Because of that, they are highly sensitive to external influence.  Be careful not to harm the plants, for example when you walk on them or you are using motor vehicles on moss fields or areas with lichens. 

There are only two species of flowering plants on Antarctica – the Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and the Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis).

Most common are the mosses (some 80 species) and the lichens (some 300 species), which are very well adapted to the severe conditions in Antarctica.  The recovery period of the most plants after harming is very long.  The reason for that is that they grow very slowly (some mosses grow by 0.01-0.1 mm annually) and reach an “old age” (up to 4000 years).  Footprints on a moss carpet could be visible even after 100 years.  Mosses on the rocks are hardly noticeable, so a special attention is needed.

Rule 4: Do not bring plants and animals!

* It is forbidden to import into Antarctica plants and animals that are alien to the local flora and fauna (e.g. domestic birds, dogs, cats and crops).
(Recomm. XVII-1)

Due to its geographical location, Antarctica is naturally isolated and its flora and fauna are extremely vulnerable.  The survival ability of the local flora and fauna can be threatened by alien organisms, transmitted infection, or by species competition.  For that reason, the importation of animals or plants without a special permission is forbidden.

During the last 200 years, the imported cows, dogs, cats, rabbits and rats in certain Sub Antarctic islands have caused changes in the low vegetation so that the birds which are hatching there are seriously threatened.  Also the imported plants can replace local plant species.

An example of imported infection is a colony of King Penguins in which 65% of the young penguins are infected with the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), which causes the weakening of their immune system.  That virus thrives only in poultry farms in the Northern hemisphere and was most likely brought by products of poultry chicken meat.  While there have been no registered epidemics so far, rules for quarantine and import are nonetheless necessary.


Rule 5: Respect protected areas!

*  The location and all restrictions regarding the access and the activities in the specially protected areas and their vicinity should be made public.
*  Comply with the restrictions in force.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

There are a number of areas in Antarctica, including marine areas, which on the basis of particular ecological, scientific, historical and esthetical values and in view of their uniqueness, have the status of strict protection.

Not only the protected territories and areas are subject to certain restrictions, but also the territories bordering them.  Therefore, it is necessary that their precise location and relevant restrictions are made known to all participants in the expeditions, as well as to all visitors to Antarctica.  Such information is provided by the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute. 

Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) for example can be areas of special biologic or scientific interest such as ice-free rocks, rare plant communities, places of bird nesting, pristine areas free from human intervention; areas with rare geological formations; ice formations or areas with unusual animal communities.  Entry and overflying by any means (on foot or by motor vehicles and aircraft) into/over these areas without special permission is forbidden. 

Also, there are Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMA) in which by the so called management plans the negative environmental impact is prevented.  Another purpose of these plans is to protect places and monuments of historical significance.  Any intended tourist visits to such areas would need authorization.  According to the Protocol on Environmental Protection, scientific research has priority.

Antarctica is the largest untouched area on the Earth, whose unique nature is protected thanks to the international efforts.  Activities that are not visible can be carried out in the protected areas; for instance, animal species for which an area is the only habitat for survival can be monitored by means of hidden equipment.  Protected areas can be used for outstanding research such as studying global climate change in recent millennia, which is recorded in the Antarctic ice.  Bans and restrictions on the access to protected areas have also the purpose of avoiding the human presence interference with the results of scientific research (various emissions, change in animal behavior etc.)

The availability of access to relevant maps and information on the protected areas is essential.

Rule 6: Respect historical sites and monuments!


*  Do not damage, remove or destroy historical sites and monuments as well as objects related to them (artifacts).
*  Do not write and paint names and graffiti on rocks and buildings.
*  Do not change or destroy historical buildings and huts whether inhabited or abandoned.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

Historic buildings in Antarctica are museums, which are maintained and considered by the relevant countries as national monuments.  In spite of the protective measures, these buildings are subjected to the harmful effects of the local climate (snow, ice, wind and extreme temperatures).  Human presence also contributes to damaging these valuable monuments, which are our common heritage and also evidence of a remarkable history since the time of the early explorers and expeditions.

Rule 7:  No 'souvenirs’

*  Do not pick and do not take with you any biological or geological samples, as well as objects from past times for 'ouvenirs' such as stones, bones, eggs, fossils, and objects or parts of historical buildings.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

Please, respect the originality of Antarctica and do not take with you bones from whales, alive or dead animals or parts of them, and plants (mosses and lichens).

Rule 8: Respect scientific research!


*  Before visiting Antarctic scientific bases it is necessary to obtain due authorization.  Rules and guidelines must becomplied with strictly.
*  Do not remove or alter anything in research equipment and markings.  Do not alter anything in the scientific research base and its surroundings.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

The frequent visits to the scientific research bases during the last few years have lead to interference with the process of research activities and the loss of valuable time.

Tourist visits can distort the very tight schedule (limited recourses, short summer), but they could also be a welcome diversity.  In any case, scientific research has priority over tourism.  The bases have their regulations for such visits in order to avoid the disturbance of normal scientific activities.

Rule 9: Mind your safety!


*  Estimate correctly your capabilities according to the Antarctic risks.  Plan your actions so that not to threaten your safety.
*  Do not rely on emergency services.  Your independence (without relying on someone else’s help) can be ensured by reasonable planning, using quality equipment and well trained staff.
*  Do not walk on glaciers or on large snow fields without using the proper equipment and without any experience.  The danger of getting into hidden glacier crevasses is high.
*  Enter refuges only in the case of emergency.  If you happen to use the equipment or the food stored there, you need to notify immediately the nearest scientific base or state office.
*  Observe and follow the advice and instructions given by the leader.  Do not separate from the group.
*  Observe the smoking ban in and around the buildings.  Prevent by any means the starting of fire.  Fire is one of the greatest dangers in Antarctica.  The dry climate and limited abilities for preventing fires, and also the large amount of fuel on the base increase the risk of fire.
(Recomm. XVII-1)


Avoid walking away from the base without an escort.  Always carry a radio with you. 

The cold winds can blow with gale force in a very short time, and in a combination with low temperatures they can cause frostbite within minutes.

Similarity to many coastlines, unexpected deterioration of visibility (such as 'whiteout' or 'blowing snow') may hinder your orientation and to make your coming back impossible.

Rescue missions could be prevented because of the severe climate conditions despite the modern equipment. 

Many accidents have happened as a result of collapsing snow cornices or falling into hidden glacier crevasses.  Avoid the so called “Russian roulette” attitude to safety.

Take all the necessary precaution measures when going on a boat trip.  Unexpected weather turns (within minutes) can prevent your return to the Base.

One of the worst dangers is the possible burst of fire.  The dry climate, the limited capabilities for preventing it and the large amount of flammable material which is stored make the risk of fire higher. All buildings have to be equipped with instructions for actions during a fire and also with fire extinguishers, which have to be checked every year.  Every expedition participant and every visitor has to be duly instructed.

Rule 10: Keep Antarctica pristine!


*  Do not throw any litter on the soil.  Bonfires are forbidden.
*  Do not harm or pollute the water.
(Recomm. XVII-1)

The remarkable pristinity of Antarctica, which is still preserved and cannot be found anywhere else on the planet fascinates every visitor.  That has to be preserved!

All the activities have to be implemented so that the uniqueness of Antarctica and all of its esthetical virtues are preserved. 

Contribute with all your efforts to keeping the environment by preventing the throwing litter on the ground and in the water.  The dumping of litter in the sea has to be made according to the existing regulations.

Observe the following:

  Do not leave any traces behind; do not take anything but photos for souvenirs!
  Do not throw away anything, not even cigarette butts!
  Do not surround the animals!
  Respect the uniqueness of Antarctica!

The uniqueness of Antarctica is the reason for its great attractiveness.  The increasing number of visitors leaves its traces and the evidence of urbanization makes the human presence on the Continent more and more visible.  Not only garbage as paper handkerchiefs, aluminum cans of drinks, but also the organic litters – for example banana peels and human feces are a problem.  This “heritage” not only makes the environment uglier, but because of the specific climate conditions the process of natural biodegradation may take decades.

Plan well your preparation by minimizing your packing material.  When selecting packaging supplies, washing substances for washing machine and others, give preference to large packaging and simple packaging materials (paper, cardboard, aluminum cans).
