IPY Legacy Workshop




IPY Legacy Workshop
Submitted by Norway


Summary
Attached is the report from the Workshop on the legacy of the International Polar Year. The workshop was discussed at and supported by ATCM XXXII in Baltimore (ref. para 154-157 of the final report). Parties are invited to consider the findings and recommendations of the report as basis in future discussions on the Antarctic IPY legacy. 
Background
At ATCM XXXII in Baltimore Norway and the UK presented WP 6 Maximizing the Antarctic IPY legacy which proposed a scoping study and workshop (joint with Arctic Council) to look at ways in which the legacy of the IPY in Antarctica and the Arctic could be maximized. The suggestion was discussed and supported at ATCM XXXII (ref. para 154-157 of the final report), and it was agreed that the conclusions and recommendations from the workshop would be reported back to ATCM XXXIV.
On basis of support from both the Arctic Council and the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting the Norwegian Polar Institute invited to a workshop on the legacy of the International Polar Year in conjunction with the IPY Oslo Science Conference in Lillestrøm, Norway on 9 June 2010. The workshop was attended by around 60 representatives (scientists and policy shapers) from a number of countries and relevant organizations. 
The discussions that took place during the Workshop proved beyond doubt that the legacy of the IPY is monumental and important, and that continued efforts are needed to ensure the best possible management of this legacy. 
The attached report summarizes the workshop discussions on IPY legacy issues considered most pertinent to pursue within the framework of the Arctic Council and Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, including issues for which declared support from these two polar policy bodies could contribute in facilitating implementation in relevant organizations, in particular IASC and SCAR.
The workshop identified fourteen recommended follow-up action areas within six overarching themes:
    • Data access and management
    • Access to study areas and research infrastructure
    • Education and recruitment
    • Science communication and outreach
    • Scientific directions
    • An International Polar Decade

The recommendations relating to the IPD has more recently been moved forward through the Joint WMO-Roshydromet workshop on the International Polar Decade initiative, held in St. Petersburg (Russia) on 14-15 April 20111.
