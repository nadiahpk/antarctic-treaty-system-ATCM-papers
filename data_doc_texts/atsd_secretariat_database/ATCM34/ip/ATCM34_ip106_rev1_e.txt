IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2010-11 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2011-12 Antarctic Season  
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
In its 20th anniversary year, the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide an overview of Antarctic tourism from IAATO member operators for the recently completed 2010-11 season and estimates for the 2011-12 season.
Compared with the total number of IAATO operator visitors for the previous 2009-10 Antarctic tourism season (36,875), the total for 2010-11 decreased to 33,824 or 8.3%. Details of the 2010-11 season can be found in Appendix 1 of this paper. 

Estimates for the 2011-12 season can be found in Appendix 3 of this paper. These estimates indicate a total of 25,319 visitors, a decrease of 25.1% from the total number for the 2010-11 season just ended. 

This decrease in the number of estimated visitors for the 2011-12 season is primarily due to the withdrawal from the market of several IAATO members that operate cruise-only programs that are affected by amendments to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) MARPOL Annex I that bans the use and carriage of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in the Antarctic Treaty area and comes into effect August 1, 2011.

1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As during the past 20 seasons, IAATO membership continues to incorporate the majority of recognized Antarctic private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS Passenger Ship operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty area are members of IAATO at the present time. All these operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National Authority.
A summary of IAATO member activities for the 2010-11 season follows:

    • 19,065 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic Treaty Area, an 11.8% decrease from the previous season. Of this total:
        ◦ 18,021 passengers aboard traditional seaborne vessels landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area, 13% fewer than the previous season;
        ◦ 331 passengers landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica, down 16.6% from the previous season;
        ◦ 182 passengers sailed aboard yachts (sailing or motor) that carry 12 or fewer passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area, a 1.1% increase from the previous season;
        ◦ 531 passengers participated in air-cruise voyages in the Antarctic Peninsula area, flying from South America to King George Island to embark a vessel and cruise for six-to-nine days, making landings. This represents a 53.9% increase over the 345 passengers from the 2009-10 season. The two vessels participating in this air-cruise segment included a 62-passenger expedition vessel and a 12-passenger motor yacht.

    • 14,373 passengers traveled aboard large vessels operating “cruise-only” voyages, making no landings in the Antarctic Treaty Area. This is a 4.3% decrease in the number of cruise-only passengers from the 2009-10 season.

    • 386 clients participated in multi-day land expeditions in the continental interior, an increase of 153 visitors in this segment, or 65.7%. 

    • No passengers participated in IAATO-member over-flights to the Antarctic continent.


1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, running events, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. 
Appendices to this addendum provide further details of the scope of IAATO-member activities, including vessel/aircraft, departures, passenger numbers and activities. The appendices are as follows:

Appendices:
    • Appendix 1: Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2010-11;
    • Appendix 2: Histogram of 1992-2012 Antarctic Tourist Trends – Landed Passengers, including ship-based and land passenger numbers;

The vast majority of commercially operated voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the six-month austral summer season (from mid-October to early April), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Treaty Area. 

1.3	Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more than 100 different nationalities were represented in tourists who visited the Antarctic during the 2010-11 season. Of those recorded on the Post Visit Report Forms, the majority (77%) came from 10 different countries (see Table 1).

1.4	Commercial Tour Vessels Operating in 2010-11
A full list of IAATO member-operated commercial tour vessels that completed cruises to the Antarctic, including information on their registry, permitting authority and passenger capacity is given in Appendix 1. In total, there were 22 vessels carrying 13-200 passengers; two vessels carrying 201-500 passengers; plus seven cruise-only vessels each carrying more than 500 passengers.

1.5	Yacht (Sailing and Motor) Activities
Sixteen yachts carrying 12 or fewer passengers visited the Antarctic Treaty Area by IAATO member yacht operators during the 2010-11 season. This information is also detailed in Appendix 1.

Visits and activities by yachts not operated by IAATO members are not included in these statistics. IAATO remains concerned about visitors traveling to Antarctica aboard non-IAATO operated yachts; some of these appear not to be authorized and their crews may not be familiar with the Environmental Protocol and its obligations. Non-IAATO yachts sighted in the Antarctic Peninsula are further described in ATCM XXXIV WP020 Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2010-11.  

1.6	IAATO Member-Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels & Yachts
Full details of the activities offered are listed in Appendix 1 and Appendix 3. All activities are approved through the Environmental Impact Assessments or operational documentation submitted in advance of the season. All activities are intended to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for at least a decade. 
Additional information on Antarctic Peninsula activities is presented in ATCM XXXIV IP105 Report on IAATO Operator use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2009-10 & 2010-11 Seasons.

1.7	Commercial Land Tourism 
Two members and one associate member that operate land tourism activities during the 2010-11 season. Adventure Network International / Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below) conducted activities for the 25th consecutive season, and The Antarctic Company (referred to as TAC below), which operated in Antarctica for the sixth consecutive season and second as an IAATO member.
The third operator is White Desert (referred to as WDL below), which operated in Antarctica for the fifth consecutive season and first as an IAATO associate member. Flights and logistics for White Desert are coordinated through TAC.
ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and White Desert operated out of Cape Town, South Africa.
The three companies employed experienced staff and guides, over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their implementation in Antarctica.

1.8	Air / Land Activities conducted by IAATO Members in the Antarctic Peninsula1
For the 2010-11 season, IAATO associate member Destination Management Chile (DMC), operating through Aerovias DAP, conducted two separate day-trips from Punta Arenas, Chile to King George Island. A total of 64 visitors were escorted on visits to Frei Base, with five visitors also taking Zodiac rides to Ardley Island. Eighteen other planned day-trips were cancelled due to weather or other reasons.

1.9	Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members
For the 2010-11 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by IAATO members.

2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2011-12 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2011-12 season. According to estimates provided to IAATO by members, 18,913 seaborne and yacht (sailing and motor) passengers are expected to land in Antarctica from commercially organized vessels, 1,002 from combination air-cruise programs, and 508 on air/land expeditions during the 2011-12 season. Another 4,896 are anticipated on cruise-only programs. No over-flights by passengers aboard IAATO-member aircraft are expected during the 2011-12 season.
Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B, Naiad, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of underwater ROVs.

It is anticipated that air/land tourism will see a one-off season increase in tourism activities during December 2011 and January 2012 due to the Amundsen and Scott centenary celebrations at the South Pole. 

3.0 Tourism Trends
A trends chart showing the change in IAATO operator landed passengers, dating from the 1992-1993 season and including estimates for the 2011-12 season, can be found in Appendix 2 of this paper. 

While partially the result of the lingering effects on tourism from a weak worldwide economy, the overall decrease in visitor numbers over the past three seasons also reflects a decline in the mid-size category of ship-borne tourism (201-500 passengers). During the 2008-09 season, for example, five mid-size vessels conducted 26 voyages and carried 7,738 passengers. For the 2010-11 season, there were two vessels, 12 voyages and 2,574 passengers. Projections for the 2011-12 season are one vessel, 10 voyages and 2,250 passengers, respectively.

As noted in the introduction of this paper, actions taken at the IMO to ban the use and carriage of heavy fuel oil will affect the cruise-only segment of Antarctic tourism over the next few seasons. Therefore, predicting the number of tourism vessels, including cruise-only and mid-size ships, beyond the 2011-12 season is more difficult. 

Nevertheless, demand to visit Antarctica is expected to continue, and growth could resume in 2012-13 and the years following, should economic conditions be favorable.
