The Antarctic Environmental Protocol, 1991-2011




The Antarctic Environmental Protocol, 1991-20111

Summary

This paper reflects on Antarctic environmental protection since the signature of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. There have been some significant accomplishments; some issues remain outstanding; and some developments of concern that  appear incompatible with the commitments expressed under the Protocol. While overall the Antarctic region is protected, it is also under growing environmental pressures, some of which are not being addressed strategically. The challenge for Antarctic Treaty Parties is to respond effectively and in a timely way to emerging pressures, and not let territory or resource interests prevail over international obligations and the global benefits of protecting the Antarctic.

1. Introduction

The signature of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1991 was a turning point in Antarctic conservation, notably because of its prohibition on mineral resource activities.  It generated expectations that the implementation of the Protocol would result in an enhanced protection of the Antarctic environment.  Acting immediately, the Parties committed themselves to interim implementation until the Protocol entered into force.2  It entered into force legally in 1998 following ratification by all the Parties.   Fig. 1 contains a timeline summarising key events of since the negotiations of the Protocol began.

This Information Paper provides a commentary on the nearly twenty years that have elapsed since the signature of the Protocol, evaluating progress on a range of key issues relevant to environmental protection and Protocol implementation.  The paper is not intended to be a comprehensive review of every aspect of implementation of the Protocol, but rather focuses on some key environmental issues and overall implementation trends. 

Overall, there have been some significant accomplishments; some issues remain outstanding; and some developments of concern that  appear incompatible with the commitments expressed under the Protocol.

2. Implementing the Protocol

The Protocol relies on the individual and collective efforts of the Parties for its implementation. Implementation is about establishing an ongoing process rather than reaching a final stage, and includes two basic aspects: legal implementation and practical implementation.3    

Depending on the legal system of each country, some countries needed to pass national implementing legislation to complete the process of ratification of the Protocol, while others did not need to go through this procedure.   As many provisions of the Protocol are not entirely self-executing they need to be implemented by more detailed domestic instruments.  Most Antarctic Treaty Parties have adopted some form of legislation and/or regulations to implement the Protocol.  In some instances this process took well over a decade since the Protocol’s signature.4 The content of domestic legislation should be faithful to the spirit, objectives and principles of the Protocol, and its result should be effective practical implementation, which is primarily the responsibility of those in charge of Antarctic logistics and operations.5 

Practical implementation requires enforcing specific prohibitions, the regular use of Environmental Impact Assessments, and arranging permitting requirements.  It also includes the development of contingency and waste management plans, arrangements to fulfil reporting obligations, and initiatives to stimulate international cooperation. Education and training of Antarctic personnel is important to ensure effective application and enforcement of the provisions of the Protocol in Antarctica.  The right of the public to be informed about the working of the Antarctic Treaty System and to comment on Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations is embodied in the Protocol and is also part of its implementation.

One of the best ways available of assessing the practical implementation of the Protocol is through inspections under Art. 14 of the Protocol (carried out concurrently with inspections under Art. VII of the Antarctic Treaty).6  (Reports under Art. 17 of the Protocol are another way of assessing implementation.7)   Nineteen of such inspections have taken place since 1991 (including three reported at this ATCM)8 providing an insight on progress made to implement the Protocol.9  Necessarily, some aspects of inspections concern matters not directly related to the Protocol but that bear consequences for the environment, such as the conduct of research at Antarctic stations, the use of alternative energies, and tourism policies.  

Implementation standards vary between stations and within different aspects of some stations’ operations.10  Inspections have focused on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the concentration of stations is greater and also the standards of implementation, although there have been inspections also in Queen Maud Land, Ross Island, and elsewhere in Antarctica.   Some stations in comparatively remote areas have been comparatively under-inspected (see e.g. ASOC and UNEP, 2005).  

On the whole, inspections reported progress in many aspects of implementing the Protocol since 1998 – such as waste management – but it is apparent that some aspects are taking a long time to be implemented.   Intriguingly, the findings of recent inspections are in some cases not substantially different from those carried out ten or more years earlier.  Aspects of recurrent concern include fuel storage and handling; waste management (particularly waste storage); sewage treatment; management of former sites (abandoned stations); and limited awareness of EIA and EIA follow up on the ground.  Factors inherent to individual stations (such as size, age, and location) and of the individual National Antarctic Programs influence implementation of the Protocol. Inspection reports have also raised questions about related issues such as the limited use of alternative energy; the relatively high number of unoccupied stations in some areas; tourism policies at some stations; changes in ownership patterns; and the need for greater use of research facilities for science.   

3. Implementation accomplishments

The main accomplishments include the very high standards of implementation by some Parties; the operation of the CEP; the review of Annex II and the signature of Annex VI.

    • Scope and depth of compliance with the Protocol achieved by some Parties:  This is reflected, inter alia, in the detailed consideration of environmental issues in the planning and conducting of some operations (such as the renovation of some existing research stations or construction of some new stations; and some large scale research projects); consistent reporting under Art. 17 of the Protocol and production of EIAs; some clean up operations of past worksites (including the attempted recovery of drilling fluid from a borehole); and the insertion of environmental protection measures at all scales of activity by some Parties.  

    • The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP):  The establishment of the CEP is mandated by Art. 11 of the Protocol.  The regular meetings of the CEP have provided a platform to improve environmental protection, including notably through the consideration of CEEs and the production and review of protected management plans (through the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans) and setting up a five-year work plan.  The mandate and modus operandi of the CEP does not enable it to deal with environmental emergencies as and when they occur (such as the sinking of the MV Explorer) or to take issue with Parties that are plainly failing in their obligations under the Protocol.  However, the CEP has become “the workhorse of the ATCM”11 (Sánchez and McIvor, 2007) and has had a positive role in the promotion of higher environmental standards by its Members.

    • Review of Annex II:  The reviewed Annex was approved in 2009.  The matter had been referred to the Legal and Institutional Working Group by the CEP in 2006, after it had spent several years being reviewed. The final result was a greatly watered down version of what might have been, given the objections of a handful of Parties; it failed to consider microorganisms and invertebrates, and left out mammals. Under the consensus system the lowest common denominator often prevails and this was one such case.  Still, Annex review is one of the obligations of the Protocol and this was eventually accomplished despite political difficulties.12

    • Signature of a Liability Annex: The obligation to develop a liability regime stems from Protocol Article 16 and the Final Act of 11th ATSCM where the Protocol was adopted.  It took 13 years of negotiations to arrive at this Annex.  About half the Consultative Parties favored a comprehensive liability regime, but the prospects of a broad-reaching liability regime disappeared following the articulation of a much more restricted option – addressing environmental emergencies alone – by the US from 1995.  The Annex is far less comprehensive than ASOC and many Parties hoped for, but what has been achieved is an important first step and is a significant enhancement of the Protocol’s obligations. If this first annex has indeed provided a peg on which to hang subsequent development, it may become a more significant achievement.  At the time of the Annex VI signature in 2005 ASOC noted that “[t]he challenge now is to ensure that it enters into force in a reasonable time, and substantially quicker than the seven years it took for the Protocol itself to enter into force.”13 (ASOC, 2005).  Six years after this comment only a handful of Parties have ratified Measure 1 (2005) adopting Annex VI, so that the Annex VI has not yet become effective.  Decision 4 (2010) reflects awareness of this situation and includes a commitment to discuss annually “what action may be necessary and appropriate to encourage Parties to approve Annex VI in a timely fashion.”  

4. Outstanding issues

Outstanding issues of the implementation of the Protocol include aspects related to wilderness values; international cooperation and the proliferation of stations;  the application of Environmental Impact Assessments; the treatment of cumulative impact; and the implementation of aspects of exchange of information and protected areas.  

    • Wilderness values: The protection of wilderness values is one of the basic mandates of the Protocol – notably Art. (3)(1).  While there is no agreed definition of “wilderness” or “wilderness values” in the Antarctic context, there appears to be a broad understanding of what is meant. Overall, remoteness and a relative absence of both people and indications of past and present human presence or activity are key attributes of wilderness. There is also a broad understanding – notably in Art. 3 of the Protocol, and also in various management plans – that the Antarctic wilderness deserves protection, and that actions that compromise or jeopardize wilderness values are undesirable.  So far this concept has had limited practical application, including in the minimisation of the human footprint on the region.14

    • International cooperation and the proliferation of stations:  Under Article 6, Consultative Parties are expected to cooperate in the planning and conduct of activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area. This includes collaboration in relation to the construction of new stations and the sharing of bases and other facilities. In practice, remarkably little such cooperation seems to exist. With the notable and positive exception of The Netherlands, acceding states still seem to feel it necessary to establish their own facilities.   Among others, the Czech Republic, Belgium, India, China, and Chile have built or are building new stations since the Protocol was signed; other stations are planned.  These developments – coupled with new runways, maintained roads, camps, refuges and depots – further encroach upon the Antarctic wilderness.15  

    • Environmental Impact Assessments:16 The preparation of EIAs at the appropriate level is stipulated under Annex I and is essential if the Protocol is to have its intended effect.  There are concerns that EIAs are not being produced for all activities, or at the required level.  Alternatively, an operator may go through the motions of producing an EIA, and even though there are problems with the proposed activity, will consider its completion as sufficient to allow an activity to proceed. The EIA may be only nominally completed resulting in a less than adequate level of protection.  In particular, the CEE process should be strengthened17 and EIAs should be better applied to tourism.18  

    • Cumulative impact: Local human activities in Antarctica have resulted in a broad range of environmental impacts, some of which are cumulative.19  Cumulative impact analysis is an integral part of modern integrated environmental management, and is a required component of Antarctic IEEs and CEEs.  Despite this, it is usually overlooked or considered in a perfunctory manner in Antarctic EIAs.20 The various conceptual and methodological issues surrounding assessment of cumulative impact remain poorly developed. Despite small workshops organized by IUCN (1996) and by NSF/IAATO (2000), the issue remains complex.21  Given the manifest inability of individual operators to work their way independently to an adequate assessment of cumulative impact, this matter should now be addressed by the CEP as a matter of urgency.  The contribution of tourism to cumulative impact is an important area in terms of the Protocol especially since tourism has changed significantly (in scale and scope) since its adoption in 1991. 

    • Exchange of information: Art. 17 of the Protocol requires Parties to report annually on the steps taken to implement the Protocol.  This requirement is a proxy indicator of implementation standards. Information exchange should show not only what Parties are doing implement the Protocol, but also – by omission – what they are not doing.  Only a few Parties have reported consistently since 1998; others began reporting in later years, sometimes in documents submitted to the CEP or otherwise, reportedly, in their websites; yet other ATCPs ignored this requirement of the Protocol.  However, in recent years the Secretariat has set up an electronic information exchange system that encourages Parties to make Exchange of Information submissions on line.  This new system has been implemented with relative success, although not all Parties seem to report consistently all years.  

    • Protected Areas:  To develop an effective matrix of Antarctic Protected Areas, a combination of policy steps and decisions are required. ASOC suggests that the CEP be urgently tasked with providing the ATCM with advice on which parts of Annex V are not yet fully represented with designated Protected Areas, in addition to those parts that no longer represent best-practice or are otherwise outdated, and recommendations on the best new approaches to address the needs of the 21st century. The review and amendment or modification, and any actual drafting of changes to Annex V, can then occur within the ATCM.  An additional issue is the sometimes excessive focus on small areas in detriment to debate and actions addressing “big picture” issues. There has been some progress on addressing issues from broad strategic perspectives, notably at the CEP, but much work is done on the minutiae of what happens at specific sites – such as sites visited by tourists, Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) or Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) – which occupy relatively small areas and tend to be regarded individually rather than linked as a part of a coherent protected area system.22  

5. Developments of concern

Several developments in the Antarctic are of concern, and difficult to understand if one assumes that the Protocol is a key element in Antarctic operations.  These include:

    • Chronic, substandard implementation of the Protocol: The significant gap that developed between those Parties appropriately implementing many Protocol obligations, and those lagging significantly behind, discussed previously, is one of the more disappointing developments since the Protocol was signed.  In fact, some research stations appear to be caught in a pre-1991 time warp.  For instance, observations made by German scientists at Fildes Peninsula in King George Island, as reported to the Oslo 2010 Science Conference, suggested that some things have hardly changed since the late 1980s, or if they improved in the intervening years, they have once again gone back to the old ways.23  Based on the findings of various inspection reports (section 2), including inspections reported at this ATCM, this assessment does not seem to be unique for Fildes Peninsula.  Earlier on ASOC had hoped that with the encouragement of the various components of the Antarctic Treaty System – particularly the Committee for Environmental Protection and, once it began to function, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat – this gap would begin to close and there would be a more consistent implementation of the Protocol across all Antarctic operators. This seems now less likely.

    • The case of the Southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus: The Southern giant petrel was not listed as Specially Protected Species under Protocol Annex II, despite ongoing pressure from resource activities.  ASOC regrets that a more precautionary approach was not taken in the face of insufficient scientific information. 

    • Conflicts between international area protection and national interests: The construction of a new station in the Larsemann Hills outside a proposed Facility Zone (that is, right in the middle of an area set aside for protection from such developments) in spite of the ongoing discussions to establish an ASMA ,  implies a diminution of the wilderness values of the region; and insufficient attention to the proper CEE process regarding the consideration of the alternatives. The conflict has now been satisfactorily resolved by all Parties involved in the area, but this remains as an example of how national interests may prevail over environmental protection, even in the face of international best intentions.   Taking this event as an example, ASOC contends that Antarctic areas with a high concentration of facilities should be internationally managed as a matter of routine, using the area protection and management tools available under the Protocol such as ASPAs and ASMAs, and current experience on the implementation of Protected Areas such as the use of zoning.  

    • Dependent and Associated Ecosystems:  Despite the Protocol’s commitment to ensure protection for dependent and associated ecosystems, there is limited evidence of this innovative and environmentally sane concept in the practical operation of the Protocol. The capacity to designate “marine areas” as protected areas under Annex V has, so far, been made contingent upon CCAMLR agreement.  In 2005 concrete progress was made to further “deconstruct” the Protocol, with the adoption of a Decision on “Marine Protected Areas and other areas of interest to CCAMLR” (Decision 9-2005).  This essentially gives even greater control of the marine component of the Antarctic Treaty Area to CCAMLR, weakening Protocol provisions under Annexes I, II and V.   With CCAMLR now increasingly operating as a regional fisheries agreement, it will be difficult for it to agree to deny any appreciable marine area to Members’ fishing fleets.  

One light at the end of the tunnel is the ongoing discussion on bioregionalization and the establishment of a network of Southern Ocean Marine Protected Areas, which may yet contain, if not prevent, excessive legal and illegal exploitation of the marine resources of the Southern Ocean.  A first step was taken in designating the South Orkneys no-take MPA in 2010, and other important MPAs and Reserves are being considered by CCAMLR now for decision in November 2012.24 

6. Concluding Remarks

The Protocol has been a significant step forward for the protection of the Antarctic environment.  Nearly twenty years after its signature we should ask which way things are going.  While the Antarctic region is nominally protected, it is also under growing environmental pressures – from both without and within the Antarctic Treaty System – that are not always addressed effectively, proactively or strategically.   

The Protocol is not consistently applied and some of its more innovative and progressive aspects of environmental management are constantly under pressure.  A better and more consistent implementation of the Protocol’s letter and intent is required. This includes greater transparency in national implementation, and a greater commitment to international management of the Antarctic region.

Most Antarctic experts agree that increased pressures and impacts loom in the horizon, both short-term and longer term.   The challenge for Antarctic Treaty Parties is to respond more effectively and in a timely way to emerging pressures – through implementing the Protocol effectively, and complementing it with other instruments, as required – and not let territory or resource interests prevail over international obligations and the global benefit of protecting the Antarctic.
