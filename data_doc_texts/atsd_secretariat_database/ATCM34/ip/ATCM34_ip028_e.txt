Technical safety standards and international law affecting yachts with destination Antarctica
    1. Introduction
After the sinking of the Norwegian sailing yacht BERSERK in January 2011, the risk assessment of individual tourist activities strongly came into focus again. Due to the lack of information stated during the CEP discussion on tourism in 2010, Germany attempted to collect data on yachts visiting Antarctica. To describe the state of the art of these tourism activities, INASEA commissioned by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA), compiled literature and web-based data on technical safety standards and legal regulations for yachts in a technical study. 
In the near future, a further increase of sailing trips is expected in conjunction with less sea ice coverage and longer-lasting seasons. Rising interest in the last pristine continent may then result in cumulative impacts which should be obviated by regulations to be taken today. Aspects of general concern are lacking safety standards and potentially insufficient preparation for yacht expeditions in high latitudes. To give substantial information on useful tools to be discussed for binding regulations, the study assembled data and material on recommended safety equipment and general preparation procedures. In addition, legal regulations German yachts have to adhere to were compiled to make clear that laws and regulations applied to these yachts depend on the port of registry. The present survey may encourage discussions within the ICG on the “CEP study on environmental aspects and impacts of tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica” and possibly within other relevant fora.
    2. Summary of safety standards and legal regulations
Depending on the ship size, different international regulations affect the safety equipment. Boats which are smaller than 24 meters fall under national law regulations and are, in most cases, not considered by international law.
        2.1. Ship size and its relevance for international regulations
Sailing yachts are the typical picture when you hear the word ‘yacht’. However, the specific definition is much more difficult. Rarely the size of the boat is relevant to international regulations. Within SOLAS (International Convention for the Safety Of Life At Sea), the number of passengers is a decisive criterion for the distinction between passenger ships and cargo ships, while small cargo ships as well as private pleasure yachts are exempt. 
According to IMO (International Maritime Organisation) definitions, ATCM regulations like Resolutions and parts of Visitor Site Guidelines are valid for passenger ships with more than 12 passengers on-board. In addition, SOLAS contains chapters which specify special rules for ships with more than 36 passengers. 
In line with EU directives, there is a specification of rules for recreational/pleasure craft of a size up to 24 meters which regulates some safety equipment for ships with less than 12 passengers. Working on yacht safety standards also necessitates a clarifying discussion on the term ‘yacht’ on international level.
        2.2. Proposal for the extension of safety regulations for yachts with destination Antarctica
During all phases, from preparation to realization of a sailing trip to Antarctica, the remoteness and sensitivity of the region and its hard conditions have to be carefully considered. It is vital to take along adequate equipment and to instruct everybody on board for special situations as e.g. „Send an emergency call“, „Man Over Board-maneuver“, „Fire on board“, „Abandon Ship“, “Medical emergency”, “Secure navigation under harsh conditions” and “Environmental hazard”. Every precaution possible should be taken.
Following items are highlighted as important preparation and general provision for safety and environmental protection of Antarctica: 

    1) Risk assessment analysis for all parts of expedition, e.g.:
    • Sailing expedition as such
    • Land-based activities
    • Sea-based activities
    2) Simplified Safety Management System (SMS) according to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code including:
    • Safety
    • Environmental protection during land and sea-based activities
    • Specification of responsible person
    • Preparation for emergencies
    • Chart of SAR Plan
    • Information exchange
    3) Choosing a well equipped ship for long-term journeys
    • Construction and design of the yacht, made for open sea (steel or aluminium hull)
    • Strengthened underwater hull
    • Boosted stem bar
    • Collision bulkhead
    • Survival suit for each person on-board 
    • Central pump system (Lenzsystem)
    • Forward sonar
    4) Open sea equipment: e.g. according to the European marking CE- A
    5) Open sea life saving appliances: e.g. according to the European marking CE- A
    6) Man-overboard marking, sturdy boarding ladder
    7) Redundancy of equipment and personal special knowledge
    8) Integration in GDMSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System)
    • EPIRB 406 (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon), PLB (Personal Location Beacon)
    • Satellite weather fax
    • Adapted training for all participants of sailing trips, e.g. „Basic Safety“ according to STCW with fire protection, survival techniques at sea, emergency training, first aid, “Man-Overboard” maneuver plus environmental concerns
    • Additional training for crew members in ship and sailing techniques
Using the Automatic Identification System (AIS), the position of ships or boats may be tracked easily to have an overview of the real ship route taken (Long-Range Identification and Tracking, LRIT). However, up to now, the intensity of yacht tourism may not yet imply the commensurability of such a system within the permit process. In case of an intensification of yacht traffic, it should be recommended to incorporate the tracking system as mandatory item. 
        2.3. Legal tools applying to German yachts attending the Antarctic Treaty area
Concerning the safety status of yachts in the Antarctic Treaty area, no clear regulation seems to affect both, ships carrying less than 12 passengers and sailing boats. Since yachts do not only comply with the regulations valid in the realm of destination but also with those valid at their port of registry, it may be useful to look at the different levels regarding recreational watercraft. Below, the international, European and German level is exemplified:
International regulations
    1) IMO “Convention for Safety of Life at Sea” (SOLAS): these rules are made for merchant ships carrying cargo or passengers for commercial purpose; but some parts may regard “all ships on all voyages”, e.g. V/19 for navigation equipment.
    2) IMO “International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers” (STCW): these important rules regard people who are employed on a ship and thus exclusively apply to bigger yachts.
    3) ATCM Resolution 4 (2004) and implementation of Measure 4(2004) becomes more important in the light of recent incidents as it will include all types of tourism.
EU Directive on Recreational Craft (94/25/EC), for all boats from 2.5 m up to 24 m hull length: 
    1) Annex I, point 2.3. Protection from falling overboard and means of reboarding: Depending on the design category, craft shall be designed to minimize the risks of falling overboard and to facilitate reboarding. 
    2) Annex I, point 3.6. Liferaft stowage: All craft of categories A and B, and craft of categories C and D longer than six metres shall be provided with one or more stowage points for a liferaft (liferafts) large enough to hold the number of persons the boat was designed to carry as recommended by the manufacturer. This (these) stowage point(s) shall be readily accessible at all times.
German law
    1) Act on Ship Safety (Schiffssicherheitsgesetz SchSG BGBl I 1998, 2860: §3): The owner/operator of a seagoing ship is obliged to ensure its safe operation. The owner/operator has, in particular, to take care that the ship itself as well as its equipment are maintained fail-safe, that it is reliably navigated and that all necessary measures are taken to preserve third parties as well as the marine environment from harm resulting from its operation.
    2) Ordinance on Seagoing Pleasure Craft (See-Sportbootverordnung):
    • Pursuant to German law, for any yacht under German flag which is commercially used and navigated by a skipper a safety certificate as well as a drive permit has to be issued (article 14 of the Ordinance on Seagoing Pleasure Craft combined with article 52 a of the Act on Ship Safety)
    • Charter boats under German flag and having their mooring abroad need a German safety certificate, too. 
    • For sailing yachts without a motor a license is not required on a national level. 
    • Commercially used pleasure craft under German flag have to meet the requirements of the Ship Safety Ordinance (safety certificate, test certificate) abroad, too.
    • The yacht master certificate for seagoing watercraft is the official, voluntary license recommended for the global navigation of motor-driven or sailing yachts (all seas). This license qualifies for the navigation of commercially used pleasure craft carrying 12 persons at the maximum as well as for the navigation of traditional vessels of 15 to 25 meters hull length off the shipping area for which a yacht master certificate is needed.
    3. Perspectives for yacht tourism in Antarctica
The interest in sailing to Antarctica may increase with a climate induced change of season duration. A longer-lasting season with less ice coverage may attract less experienced sailors to visit Antarctica. 
The information on technical safety standards of yachts listed above should be taken into account by the Treaty Parties to develop yacht guidelines or similar mandatory rules to mitigate the risks emanating from yacht expeditions.
