Exploration, search and rescue training activities in support of the scientific, technical and logistical operational tasks

Introduction:
During the 2010-2011summer campaign, it took place a training activity in the Collins Glacier in King George Island / May 25th with the aim to form a team able to carry on exploration activities in support of the scientific work and environmental monitoring as well as logistical operations.
Activities:
In January 2011 a camp was established in the Collins Bay zone, in the glacier gradients over the cove formed there.
The camp was established with the minimum means required to keep in safe and comfortable conditions a group of three explorers who carried out geographic reconnaissance hike on the field upon the glacier, on a creviced zone using ropes, crampons and other supporting materials.
Communication devices and GPS were tried out in trips by foot and snowmobile over the glacier as well as survival techniques in extreme cold weather conditions.
Scientific supporting activities were also conducted, guiding the researchers to areas of difficult access, even taking samples in zones far away from Artigas Base, 
Some ground search and rescue (SAR) activities, were conducted in coordination with the Artigas Base crew and scientists, as an exercise.
Conclusion:
The goal of this activity is to create a team that can collaborate with the development of scientific and technical activities which may require specialized support, such as deployment in remote areas, away from the terrestrial bases or the maritime platforms.
It covers a need for security, in relation to the activities of those researchers who want to present projects that require trips to distant or difficult access places.
It is also a contribution to the security for the Antarctic operations. Offering the possibility to count on a team in conditions to support search and rescue activities, with the potential to act specifically in the terrestrial environment.
