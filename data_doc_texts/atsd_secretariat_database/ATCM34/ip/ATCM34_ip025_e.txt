Notice on environmental impacts by small tourist groups within the overall frame of Antarctic tourism

    1. Introduction
Recognising the initiative of ASOC to push forward the development of a strategic vision for Antarctic tourism last year (ATCM XXXIII, IP 80 Making Tangible Progress on a Strategic Vision for Antarctic Tourism) and contributing to the continuing discussion in the ATCM Working group on tourism, Germany likes to recall the potential of environmentally sound individual tourism. Although small groups travelling to Antarctica have no proven major effect on the environment at this time, it is important not to neglect this expanding part of tourism to prevent ungovernable developments.
To support the assessment of individual tourism activities, Ecologic Institute gGmbH commissioned by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) compiled literature und web-based data on Antarctic tourism as well as visions and concerns of both, individual tourists and governmental officers for Antarctic issues. The result is a comprehensive study on individual tourism with familiar approaches within tourism concepts, which is meant as a state-of-the-art input to the discussion on regulation of tourism in general.
    2. Revised extract of the individual tourism study
Based on the analysis of scientific literature, political proposals and papers as well a number of interviews, a collection of ideas and proposals for the management of individual tourism in Antarctica was generated. The first part ‘Setting the Rules’ looks at options for advancing tourism regulation and management schemes. This part includes proposals for different instruments for tourism management, such as zoning, accreditation of tour operators and restrictions of different activities on the one hand, and underlying visions, values and principles to establish a comprehensive management framework, on the other. Above all, it has to be kept in mind that these options have to be part of a coherent environmental management system instead of standing alone. The second part ‘Complying with the Rules’ brings up ideas on how the rules and regulations can be effectively communicated in order to ensure that tourists come to Antarctica well-prepared, and how awareness can be raised for the importance of the protection and conservation of the Antarctic. 
        2.1. Setting the Rules – Options for advancing individual tourism regulation and management schemes
Strategic steps for tourism regulation
    1) Vision of the ‘Antarctic in 15 years’ and strategic plan on how to get there:
    • Development of tourism regulations towards a consistent tourism management framework within a reasonable time frame and steadily progressing at the ATCMs, see Resolution 7 (2009)
    • Creation of future scenarios of locations where tourists might go, transportation they might use and the impacts they might cause 
    • Precautionary principle (cf. Article 3 of the Environmental Protocol) serving as basis for the protection of natural areas 
    • Improved coordination between research and industry
    • Collection of relevant information (monitoring, literature studies, expert knowledge) as basis for reasonable decision making
    2) Potential of treating tourism as a discrete concern in a separate Annex of the Environmental Protocol, because tourism is a non-governmental, mainly commercial activity, not specifically regulated by the Environmental Protocol.

Recommendations
    3) Broader application of site-specific guidelines. 
    • Temporal or spatial limitation of visits of certain sites to protect their values and characteristics
    • Construction or marking of pathways at frequently visited sensitive areas
    • Improved coordination between research and tourist operators for setting rules
    4) Deliberate agreement on minimum approach distances to animals.
    • Agreement on minimum distances to animals depending on number of visitors 
    • Respect of sensitive times of wildlife (e.g. breeding, moult) in connection with minimum distances 
    • Adaptation of tourist behaviour to wildlife reaction to human presence 
    5) Review and improvement of the guide-tourist ratio enabling better supervision for reducing (intentional) misbehaviour.
    6) Proactive zoning as part of a coherent environmental management system together with other management tools.
    • Zoning on larger spatial scale (in contrast to individual sites only) by using (site) guidelines for the whole continent, allowing activities in some areas and closing off others 
    • Use of the existing zoning instruments of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) as a strategic management tool for tourism activity, and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) as a tourism management tool within discrete regions
    • Use of the intrinsic values of Antarctica as guiding criteria for the establishment of further zones (including ASPAs and particularly ASMAs)
    7) Further development of site-specific (and species-specific) guidelines for aircraft operations for pilots in form of awareness maps: Review and evaluation of existing height recommendations for aircraft operations, based on scientific research. 
Restrictions and prohibitions 
    8) Restrictions depending on type of activity, number of tourists and staff involved at sites which are planned to be visited.
    • Control of access to sites and of the type of tourism activities
    • Discussion on caps on the number of tourists
    9) Limitation of landings and activities through binding instruments approved by the ATCM.
    • Ban of land-based tourism and land-based facilities in certain areas
    • Keeping tourism ship-based to minimize the use of existing land-based facilities 
    • Restrictions for tourist activities at potentially sensitive sites 
Other rules
    10) Invitation of Antarctic Treaty Parties to formally transfer Measure 4 (2004) on ‘Insurance and Contingency Planning for Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area’ into national law. 
    11) Review of decontamination guidelines for tourists, especially for decontamination of boots during the journey.
    12) Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for tourist activities as proposed by Kriwoken and Rootes (2000) and Hemmings and Roura (2003).
    13) Assessment of the environmental footprint and regulation of all leisure activities in the Antarctic. 
    14) Creation of an operator accreditation scheme for all types of organized activities (cp. ATME 2004). 
    15) Designation of the Antarctic Treaty area as a ‘Particularly Sensitive Sea Area’ by the IMO as well as the designation of areas to be avoided (cp. ATME 2009).
Special case: yacht activities
    16) Improvement of effective communication of requirements and regulations, e.g. through information and public relations at strategic locations. 
    17) Extension of the information exchange system to other Parties which gathers data on authorized activities regarding private expeditions and yachts.
    18) Incorporation of port state control at gateway marinas to check if journeys are authorized and well prepared.
    19) Requirement for yachts to register at the last port before entering and at the first port after leaving Antarctica. 
    20) Temporary short-term IAATO membership option: use of IAATO’s knowledge and experience for just one event.
    21) Extension of IAATO’s vessel tracking system to private yachts and to non-members.
Overarching Topics
    22) Introduction of the concept of wilderness.
    • Clear definition of wilderness values
    • Wilderness values serving as a basis for regulations as recommended e.g. in Article 3 (1)+(2 b, vi) of the Environmental Protocol
    • Getting an overview of tourism regulations in the Arctic and possibly taking advantage thereof
    • Definition of long-term conservation objectives for the Antarctic
    23) Consideration of cumulative impacts from past, present and future activities in the Environmental Impact Assessments. 
    • Monitoring of frequently visited sites to assess the impacts of ongoing activities
    • Extension of the IAATO data collection on visitor socio-demographics and specific research on impacts of individual tourists
    24) Identification of carrying capacity of tourists for frequently visited sites and debate on whether to concentrate or spread tourism landings.
    25) Establishment of a framework for an observer scheme onboard tourist vessels, at stations or near historic sites. 

        2.2. Complying with the Rules - Communication and Awareness Raising
Aim:
Information of individual tourists in order to make sure that they are well-prepared before starting their journey and that they are aware of obligations and respective rules. 
How?
    • Information and awareness raising should be integrated into the authorization process 
    • Organization of education and training courses for individual tourists before their departure to the Antarctic
    • Information via websites such as www.fco.gov.uk/Antarctica, www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk and www.asoc.org or by means of other relevant material (books, brochures, flyers etc.)
    • Leaflets with necessary preparation information (in the four Treaty Languages) and checklists with the most important issues to take into account before travelling to the Antarctic such as the need to get authorization from the national authority, the need for insurance and backup support, and the obligation to respect protected areas
    • Information provided by commercial sailing guides, or through formal channels in supplying seamen with diverse updates about changes to charts and other aspects of shipping
    • Provision of a web-based Antarctic Footprint to get a better view on the personal impact of each tourist travelling to Antarctica. The Ecological Footprint is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere.
Where?
    • At gateway cities where tourists take off by plane or by vessel
    • On the plane during flight to Antarctica 
    • Yachts in particular:
    • at those points consulted before embarking on their Antarctic adventure 
    • in common places of departure, which are, in most cases, ports in South America, such as at the yacht club in Ushuaia
    • at Port State Control offices
    • in shops selling detailed maps yacht masters are likely to purchase before sailing off
    • From websites like http://www.iaato.org/yachts/ informing about helpful guidelines, government authorization contacts how to protect the environment (waste, invasive species, protected areas etc.). 
    3. Actions requested
The idea of sustainable and environmentally sound tourism is not easily applicable to the Antarctic, already due to the long distance journey. However, the strategic planning of minimum touristic impact to the mainly pristine environment will keep with the idea of the precautionary principle to protect the Antarctic wilderness. 
Germany likes to invite all ATCPs and observers to further cooperate in the development of a common concept for tourism. Recent incidents showed that especially enhanced safety specifications, but also wide-spread education may help to raise awareness for the stringent protection of Antarctica. Impacts on the Antarctic continent do not exclusively result from activities of cruise tourists but also from leisure activities of station personnel and scientists. This aspect has to be considered as well. Furthermore, motorised speed races or similar actions should be carefully evaluated by each competent authority having the precautionary idea in mind to minimise the impact of human activities and the risk of contamination for the Antarctic environment. 
ATCPs are invited to:
    1. take note of the information on the Antarctic tourism study.
    2. discuss the possibilities of international co-ordination of tourism activities as well as the content of specific regulations at an early stage to prevent long-term impacts on the Antarctic environment.
    3. assess whether the legal tools of ATCM are efficient enough to preserve the continent from human-induced changes by leisure activities in general.
    4. strengthen CEP and ATCM actions to progress with the development of a comprehensive tourism strategy.
