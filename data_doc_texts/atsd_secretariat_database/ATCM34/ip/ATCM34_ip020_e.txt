Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in Ushuaia during the 2010/2011 austral summer season 
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and vessels that visited Antarctica during 2010/2011, operating from the port of Ushuaia.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic shipborne tourism, and it concentrates more than the 90% of the worldwide Antarctic tourist activity.   
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend their Antarctic operating schedules.  
With respect to the vessels that operate from Ushuaia, a distinction should be made between those that make landings and those of a much larger size which just sail Antarctic waters without landing passengers. Similarly, a further distinction should be made between those large vessels which arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia as the port of base from which they run their Antarctic voyages. In general terms, these operations refer to passenger turnaround, port and land services as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist services. Also, at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic season most vessels arrive at the port of Ushuaia and/or depart on a positioning voyage from or towards other destinations.
In order to present the status of Antarctic tourist flows of visitors and vessels in Ushuaia in the 2010/2011 season, data was collected from the manifests provided by cruise ships to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority). This information was compared to itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained from enquiries whenever needed. 
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships which operated through Ushuaia during the 2010/2011 austral summer season 
Antarctic tour operators started operating at the port of Ushuaia on October 12th 2010, when the IB Kapitan Khlebnikov (Quark Expeditions) set sail from Ushuaia for Antarctica, and finished on March 27th 2011 with the arrival of the MV Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions) and the MV Sea Spirit (Quark Expeditions) from the Antarctic Peninsula. 
Out of 1951 scheduled Antarctic voyages calling at the port of Ushuaia, 1852 were actually run by 29 vessels, including the SV Bark Europa and the MY Hanse Explorer. January was the busiest month as regards the number of Antarctic voyages (30 %) followed by February (25 %) and December (23 %) (See figure 1).

A total of 33.656 visitors went to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2010/2011 season. Of these, three categories may be identified: a) those that both departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is to say, passengers who were in Ushuaia once either on the arrival or departure- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports (See table 1).
In the first case, passengers were counted only upon departure from Ushuaia. In the second case, several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, and some visited Antarctica as part of the voyage of the beginning or end of the season, and then operated from Ushuaia the rest of the season. In this instance the passengers who arrived at or departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account. Finally, the vessels in transit carried more than 500 passengers and cruised in Antarctica only without making any landings. Their visit to the Antarctic Peninsula was just part of a longer voyage in South America or a more extensive itinerary. Passengers in transit were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the East or West direction of the cruise ship when calling at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. A distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Therefore, taking into account the average number of passengers on board, it is noticed that 76 % (22 vessels) belong to cruise ships which carried up to 500 or fewer passengers whereas 24 % (7 vessels) correspond to vessels that carried more than 500 passengers. An average number of crew members and passengers3 as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in table 2; and in figure 2 passenger averages per vessel are shown.

Furthermore, 15 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account for 52 % of the total number of vessels. Each vessel made between 7 and 15 voyages to Antarctica, as indicated in figure 3. These vessels carried an average number of 117 passengers per voyage, ranging from 224 to 56, these being the highest and lowest number of passengers on board (see table 2). It is worth noticing that the MV Ocean Nova had a different operational activity in December and January when she conducted some voyages from 25 de Mayo Island, embarking passengers whose arrivals and departures were from Punta Arenas (Chile) by airplane. On December 10th she left Ushuaia carrying passengers towards South Shetland Islands, and returned to the port of Ushuaia on January 24th, also carrying passengers from Antarctica. From then onwards she continued operating from Ushuaia.

With regard to vessels in transit in Ushuaia, most of them are large cruise ships, which cruise Antarctic waters but do not make passenger landings in Antarctica. As it has been previously stated, these cruise ships are on itineraries round southern South America or on more extensive voyages, and on certain itineraries, they include a visit to Antarctica.  Most of these cruise ships run “pendular” voyages along Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and to visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3 below provides an overview of the deployment of these cruise ships through Ushuaia including the number of crew and passengers per voyage and indicating if the visit to Antarctica was before or after the port call in Ushuaia.

As regards visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers were counted. In this respect, 80 nationalities were identified. Most of the passengers are from the United States, followed by Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, China, Japan, Netherlands, France and Switzerland, among others. Percentages are presented in figure 4.

It has been possible to identify expedition staff members4 who may be included either on the crew or on the passenger lists. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, staff members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the landing activities. For this reason, only staff members on board vessels which carry up to 500 passengers have been considered. It has been noted that staff are not always identified on the manifests and sometimes their positions on board are not stated. Staff members are not always specified, in several cases they are listed on the passenger manifest, in some cases they are on the crew list, and on some occasions, they are listed on both, as shown in table 4. It is worth acknowledging the role of expedition staff as regards Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one guide every 20 passengers. Also, it could be noted that in some cases the presence of an ice master is stated on the manifests.

Comparison of the last three seasons
According to the data that has been collected from Ushuaia since the 2008/2009 summer season, it is possible to make some comparisons of the overall numbers of the last three seasons.
Out of the three seasons, the total number of passengers to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia hardly shows variations. The 2009/2010 season presents a minor decrease with respect to the previous one (about 6%), but in the following season there is an increase of 0,38%. However, the most significant difference appears in the ratio between the number of visitors aboard vessels which carried more than 500 passengers and those that carried less than 500. In this respect, comparing seasons 2008/2009 to 2010/2011, the former category (vessels that carried more than 500 passengers) has increased the total number of passengers in 52% and the latter (those that carried less than 500 passengers) decreased 27% (See figure 6).
Similarly, the regular voyages and the total number of voyages conducted thoughout the season can be compared. There is a decrease in the overall number of voyages (about 20%), as well as a drop in the total number of regular voyages (See figure 7).

Concluding remarks
The information presented in this document contributes to identify the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the port of Ushuaia in the 2010/2011 summer season, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff, tour operators, vessel owners, ship management companies and the registers of ships.
Besides, some comparisons with the two previous seasons could be made. The total number of passengers in the 2010/2011 season has only increased 0,38% compared to the previous season, without reaching the total number of the 2008/2009 season, showing in this case a slight difference. However, a significant increase in the number of passengers aboard vessels that carried more than 500 passengers could be clearly seen with 29% increase with respect to the previous season and 52% when compared to 2008/2009. This increase keeps an inverse ratio with the number of visitors aboard vessels that carried less than 500 passengers since, in this case, there is a decrease of approximately 27% when comparing the last season (2010/2011) to the first (2008/2009). The total number of voyages as well as vessels has declined showing a variance of 20% for the former and 19% for the latter between the 2010/2011 and 2008/2009 seasons.
The information presented in this paper contributes to the assessment of ship-borne tourist activities in the Antarctic Peninsula region, focusing on the flows of Antarctic visitors and vessels that operate in the port of Ushuaia during the austral summer seasons.
