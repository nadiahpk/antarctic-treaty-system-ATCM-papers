The legal aspects of the Berserk Expedition




The legal aspects of the Berserk Expedition
Submitted by Norway

Summary
The following gives an account of the legal aspects of the Berserk expedition to Antarctica, both in advance of, during and in the aftermath of activity in Antarctica. While the expedition in question lacked the necessary approval from Norwegian authorities, it was nevertheless a concern of the Norwegian government in so far as it involved a Norwegian registered sailboat and four Norwegian nationals. Aspects related to the search and rescue situation following the loss of the yacht Berserk is covered in a separate information paper (IP 18). 
About the Berserk 
The ~47’ yacht Berserk was on a two-year voyage through the Northwest Passage, Alaska, South-East Asia, and New Zealand.  According to the website of the expedition there was also an intention to travel to Antarctica in the context of the 100 year anniversary of Amundsen, including a visit to the South Pole (www.wildvikings.com).  The following elements seem to have been planned aspects of the expedition:
    • Sailing with the yacht Berserk to the Ross Sea 
    • Land expedition Ross Sea – South Pole – Ross Sea by ATV (extra fuel being provided by TAC at South Pole)
    • Potential overwintering (no further information on this, except a media statement by expedition leader that the two doing the traverse were equipped and prepared to overwinter without support from others)

Pre-expedition
The following gives an abridged account of information flow in advance of the expedition:
    • The Norwegian Polar Institute1 was first made aware of a potential expedition to Antarctica by the yacht Berserk and its crew through media (early 2010), and a little later through communication with Treaty Parties and tour operators who had been contacted by the expedition leader for information and questions regarding practical support. 
    • In June 2010, on the basis of these indications, the Norwegian Polar Institute submitted to the expedition leader2 information about relevant Norwegian legislation relating to Antarctica and requirements for activities in Antarctica, in particular with respect to advance notification, environmental impact assessment, contingency planning and search & rescue insurance.  As the expedition was promoted in the media as part of the Amundsen anniversary, it was assumed that it was likely to take place during the 2011/12-season.
    • No information or documentation whatsoever was received from the expedition leader or any person associated with the expedition. 
    • In November 2010 further communication from tour operators and Treaty Parties indicated that the expedition still seemed to be under consideration and was likely to be implemented already in the 2010-11 season. On this basis the Norwegian Polar Institute took the following actions:
    • Informed the expedition that they, due to lack of advance notification, environmental impact assessment and documentation re. search & rescue (including insurance), were liable for prosecution if entering Antarctica. 
    • Informed the US and IAATO that the expedition currently had no approval from Norwegian authorities due to lack of submitted advance notification and environmental impact assessment. 
    • Information others received from the expedition leader (and which Norwegian authorities have received copies of) did indicate that the expedition potentially had approval/permit from somewhere else, but no Party or operator was able to obtain any documentation on this.
    • While in harbor in NZ the expedition was informed by NZ authorities that the expedition was also subject to New Zealand’s Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 and under this legislation required to submit an environmental impact assessment.  
It is Norwegian authorities’ consideration that it is clear that the expedition was well informed about the requirements (both from Norwegian and NZ authorities, as well as a number of entities who requested permit documentation), but that the requirements were purposefully disregarded by the expedition leader. 
While there clearly was a potential that the expedition would enter Antarctica without fulfilling legal requirements, Norwegian authorities did not have the necessary legal basis to act before the expedition entered Antarctica, at which time it could be established that it was acting in violation of the regulations. 
During expedition
    • On 13 February Norwegian authorities received information from both Antarctica New Zealand and USAP indicating that the expedition was observed in the Ross Sea region. From this point forward, it was considered that the expedition was acting in violation of Norwegian legislation. 
    • On this basis initial steps were taken to consider reactions with respect to the expedition. However, before being able to conclude on this matter, the incident involving the yacht Berserk and which led to the loss of three lives occurred. At this point the Norwegian Polar Institute put aside the question of legal formalities and put all efforts into assisting, in the best possible manner, the official ministries and institutions involved in the search and rescue operations. 
    • On 15 February Antarctica New Zealand reported to the Norwegian Polar Institute an observed fuel spill situation near Scott Base. Although a relatively minor spill, this was noted as clearly in contradiction with the Norwegian Regulations Relating to Protection of the Environment in Antarctica (“Antarctic Regulations”) (cf. § 183) 
Post-expedition
    • As soon as the search and rescue efforts were officially terminated the Norwegian authorities once again started considering reactions with respect to the violation (lack of notification/IEE/insurance).
    • The Norwegian Polar Institute decided to report the expedition to the prosecuting authorities for violations of the Antarctic Regulations, i.e. lack of notification and IEE, and lack of search and rescue insurance.  Noted were also the pollution situation (cf. above) and possible unpermitted activity in specially protected areas as noted by New Zealand authorities on basis of interviews with the expedition leader after his return from Antarctica. 
    • Currently the case is under investigation, resting with Troms police district (Tromsø). The expectation is that the investigation itself will be completed by July (although with some uncertainties due to matters outside the control of the prosecuting authority). 
    • It is at this point in time not possible to indicate any direction as to the outcome of the investigation and whether penalties will be imposed.  No infringements of the Norwegian legislation relating to Antarctica have been reported earlier, and therefore no precedence exists. It should be noted, however, that the prescribed penalty scale is stipulated in § 32 of the Antarctic Regulations: Deliberate or negligent violation of these Regulations or of prohibitions or orders issued pursuant to them is punishable by fines or imprisonment for up to one year or both.
    • Norway will inform the Antarctic Treaty Parties on the outcomes of the process in an appropriate manner. 
The future
    • The expedition leader has recently formally notified Norwegian authorities about plans for a new expedition (although also indicating that it is not yet decided whether it will be considered a Norwegian expedition or not). Plans indicate the following potential elements: Sailing to the Ross Sea, ceremony in Ross Sea, search in Ross Sea, traverse (ATV) to South Pole, potential overwintering, sailing to Antarctic Peninsula. 
    • Norwegian authorities are currently waiting for more detailed information from the proponent about the plans before any further consideration of the notified activity is possible. 
    • Norway encourages Parties and organizations to inform relevant authorities about any activity connected to this expedition.
