Background
At the IMO Subcommittee on design and equipment session 55 the Working Group on the development of a mandatory code for ships operating in polar waters was established. 
The Working Group discussion focused on the technical parts of the draft Code. The attached report summarizes the discussions, and includes issues such as certification requirements, ice certification concept, structural integrity and subdivision, engine power requirements and environmental issues.
On the issue of the application of the future polarcode the Subcommittee agreed in principle that a two step approach should be taken ( ref. para 12.7 of the report DE 55\22). Taking into account the urgent need for relevant mandatory requirements the Polar Code should initially apply to SOLAS passenger and cargo ships. As a second step requirements for NON-SOLAS ships such as fishing vessels and yachts may be developed after consideration by IMO. 
The next meeting of the DE takes place 13-17 February 2012.
