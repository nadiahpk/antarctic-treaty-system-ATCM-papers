Non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica via Ushuaia during the 2010/2011 season
Summary
The aim of the present document is to report on the non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2010/2011 season.
Introduction
In the last few years, maritime tourism to Antarctica has grown up, offering various themes and activities. In this respect, particular interest has been observed in the sector of demand for visits to the Antarctic Peninsula area on board pleasure and/or sport vessels.
Pleasure and/or sport vessels are considered to include any vessel that does not intend to engage in business and is used exclusively for recreation or sporting activities.
The city of Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), situated at the extreme southern tip of South America, possesses, besides a commercial pier, the anchorage of the Fuegian Association for Subaquatic and Nautical Activities where some of the yachts and sailing boats visiting Antarctica during the southern summer season put into port. 
Recalling the documents presented at ACTM XXXIII in relation to yachts and sailing boats visiting the Antarctic Treaty area, we present a report on the non-commercial pleasure and/or sport vessels which travelled to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2010/2011 season. To this end we consulted the documentation of these vessels filed at the Argentina Naval Prefecture, the Argentime Maritime authority. In some cases, the information found in these documents has been completed by consulting key informants.
Voyages to Antarctica made by non-commercial pleasure and/or sport boats through Ushuaia
During the 2010/20111 season, three pleasure yachts made non-commercial voyages to Antarctica from Ushuaia, transporting 78 crew members and 43 passengers, with a total of 3 voyages (1 per vessel) (See table 1). 
For sailing boats, a total of 164 crew members and passengers went to Antarctica, distributed in 18 vessels which made 21 voyages (See table 2).
Finally, among all the vessels mentioned (yachts and sailing boats), 11 registers were identified, of which 8 correspond to States that are Consultative Parties of the Antarctic Treaty (Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, New Zealand, Poland, United Kingdom and Sweden) and 3 to States that are not (Antigua and Barbuda, Marshall Islands and Panama) (See Figure 1).
The information is presented in a database that allows the pleasure and/or sport vessels that made voyages to Antarctica through Ushuaia during last season to be identified.
