Training Course for Yachts intending to visit Antarctica
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
As highlighted in ATCM XXXIV/WP20,  Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2010/11  (United Kingdom, in conjunction with IAATO), the United Kingdom has recently developed detailed guidelines about its domestic legislation requirements for those seeking permits to take yachts to Antarctica, and this has been supported by a yacht training course.  This Information Paper provides further details about this course, which may be of interest to other Antarctic Treaty Parties.
Background
    1. In response to increasing concerns about the activities of yachts in Antarctica, the United Kingdom has undertaken a series of outreach initiatives to improve awareness of Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol requirements.   These have included new guidelines about the UK’s domestic legislation in respect of yacht visits to Antarctica, development of a yachting manual, placing of articles in specialist press and supporting development of a bespoke training course for those intending to visit Antarctica.
    2. The UK provided support funding for the training course, which was developed and delivered by the British company High Latitudes, which is a member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO).   The course runs for two-days, and in response to demand, it has already been run in the UK 3 times since last November and there will be a further 2 courses before the end of this year.  
    3. The course covers a wide range of issues, including essential preparations and techniques for those considering an expedition to the Antarctic, as well as safety and contingency planning, environmental considerations and permitting regimes.  The broad programme themes are as follows:
    • Antarctic conditions (weather/ice and the appropriate navigation techniques);
    • Vessel choice and preparations (including modifications);
    • Journey planning;
    • Regulations, permitting and the Antarctic environment (including IAATO requirements);
    • Anchoring; and
    • Safety and emergency planning.
    4. Further information about the course can be found at www.highlatitudes.com.  Initial feedback from the first few courses has been extremely positive, both by those planning to sail, and those planning to take motor yachts to Antarctica.  All the attendees have been keen to prepare well for any voyages to Antarctica, as well as ensuring that they abide by the rules.  
    5. Whilst it is largely tailored to UK legislative requirements, the concept and broad themes of the course are likely to be easily adaptable, and the UK would be happy to provide further information to any interested Party.
