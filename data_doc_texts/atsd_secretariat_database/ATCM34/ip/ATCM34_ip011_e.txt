Permafrost and climate change in the maritime Antarctic 
  5 Years of permafrost research at the St Kliment Ohridski Station in Livingston Island 

Collaborative research between Bulgaria, Portugal and Spain on permafrost started in 2006 in the vicinity of the St. Kliment Ohridski station in Livingston Island (South Shetlands, Antarctic). Initial field activities focused on ground and air temperature monitoring for studying micro scale influence on the active layer thermal regime. These activities complemented the Portuguese collaboration with Spain that started in 2000 in the vicinity of the Spanish Station Juan Carlos I. the integration of the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute in the permafrost monitoring programmed conducted by the Universities of Lisbon and Alcalá de Henares, allowed to widen the study area to new sites in Hurd Peninsula. 

Currently, 5 years after the start of the joint programmed, the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute provides logistical and technical support to permafrost and active layer monitoring activities, framed within collaboration with Earth scientists from the University of Sofia. The St Kliment Ohridski station provides maintenance to 3 permafrost and active layer boreholes integrated in the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P), to one meteorological station and to snow cover monitoring time-lapse cameras. Also, in the framework of the project PERMANTAR-2 - Permafrost and Climate Change in the Maritime Antarctic, other research activities are taking place with the collaboration of the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute. Research emphasizes on: i) monitoring changes in the terrestrial permafrost environment, ii) soil research, iii) snow cover monitoring using SAR and optical remote sensing, iv) terrain deformation monitoring by field electrical resistivity tomography surveying. In the framework of these activities, the St Kliment Ohridski Station has recently hosted researchers from the universities Lisbon and Évora (Portugal) and Wisconsin-Madison (USA).
