Report on IAATO operator use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2009-10 & 2010-11 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 
Introduction
IAATO is committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM information on IAATO operator landing site and site guideline use. Due to the timing of ATCM XXXIII, IAATO was unable to submit information on IAATO Member landing site and site guideline use for the 2009-10 season. This information is presented here, along with information on the recently completed 2010-11 season.
Additional information on IAATO member activities can be found in ATCM XXXIII IP113 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2009-10 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2010-11 and Beyond and ATCM XXXIV IP 106 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2010-11 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2011-12 Season.
Antarctic Peninsula traditional ship-borne tourism 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional ship-based tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, representing over 95% of all landed activity.  Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). As all traditional ship-based tourism to the Peninsula during the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 season was conducted by IAATO member operators, it is believed that this information is reflective of actual levels of this activity.

The decrease in all activities during this period is believed to be a continued consequence of the global economic downturn. This is borne out by the comparative decreases which took place across the board from the peak 2007-08 season, just prior to the economic downturn. Notably, the most substantial decrease was in the number of passengers, down 41% from the peak of 2007-08, while the number of ships decreased by 36%, due to a combination of vessels being retired, companies pulling out of the market or collapsing. Equally, the number of voyages has dropped by 27% over that same period. The number of landings made has dropped down just over seventeen percent 17%)but the number of sites used has stayed constant.
Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 season respectively. For both seasons this represents circa seventy percent (70%) of the total number of landings made and indicates that the tendency for landings to concentrate at a few popular sites continues. 
All but three of these most-visited sites – Port Charcot, Mikkelsen Harbour and Hovgaard Island – are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Site Guidelines or through National Program management through their proximity to stations. While visits by IAATO member operators to these sites follow standard codes of conduct for visits to Antarctic landing sites, IAATO would suggest that priority be given to considering development of site guidelines for Port Charcot and Mikkelsen Harbour in particular. 
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula. For 2009-2010, the season was 148 days (down from 173 the season before). The 2010-2011 season was 163 days. In both instances the season began early due to the first departure of an ice breaker for an early voyage to visit an Emperor Penguin colony. For both seasons, the last landing was made on 28th March, before the vessels left the area. The core season ran for 140 days, from the beginning of November through to mid-March. On the basis of the full season dates, no site received an average of one visit per day and on the basis of the core season only Goudier Island received an average of more than one visit per day.
Additional tourism statistics are posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).
Use of ATCM Endorsed Site Guidelines 
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms. 

The total number of known landings made at sites covered by the ATCM Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met for both seasons is shown in Appendix 3.
Co-ordination among IAATO field staff remains very effective. Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms noted that on no occasion during the 2009-2010 season the number of visits per day exceeded the limits set by the guidelines.  The 2010-2011 season data is still being analysed. 
Conclusion
IAATO will continue to provide this information annually to the CEP and ATCM for their activities. The IAATO Members remain interested in understanding better the use of ATCM Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
