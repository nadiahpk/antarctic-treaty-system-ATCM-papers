Brief Introduction of the Fourth Chinese 
National Arctic Expedition
Summary
With a solid study basis of three Arctic surveys in the past years, The Fourth Chinese National Arctic Expedition was carried out on board of R/V Xuelong from July 1 to September 20 of 2010, which took 82 days and sailed 12,600 nautical miles.  The Expedition finished the implementation work of a multi-disciplinary research mission as planned. 
1. Team composition
The Expedition was composed of 121 members which included the crew and 5 scientists from USA, France, Finland and Estonia respectively. More than 20 domestic institutions and universities sent their researchers to participate in last year’s survey. 
2. Survey area
The survey area covered 135 comprehensive marine research sites and 10 comprehensive ice research sites which included 8 short-term sea ice investigations and one long-term combined sea-ice-atmospheric observation respectively in Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Chukchi Platform as well as Canadian Basin and one investigation in North Pole. Please see the figures below.

3. The scientific objectives 
The theme of the Expedition is the Arctic Sea Ice Rapid Transition and the Response of Marine Ecosystem which determine the two scientific objectives of the Expedition as follows: 
    • The mechanism of the Arctic Sea Ice Rapid Transition;
    • The response of Marine Ecosystem to S the Arctic Sea Ice Rapid Transition. 
4. The scientific projects
Under the scientific objectives of the Expedition, the scientific projects, most of them were observation programs, were realized in the field of atmospheric physics, atmospheric chemistry, boundary layer between atmosphere, sea ice and ocean, sea ice study, physical processes of sea ice, oceanic dynamics, marine biology, biogenic elements of sea ice, geologic sampling in the seabed.. The major research projects were:
    • Physical structure of sea ice and the rapid melting process; 
    • The interaction between ocean, sea ice and atmosphere; 
    • The upper ocean structure and its impact on sea ice melting; 
    • The structure change of sea water of Arctic Ocean and its relation to melting; 
    • Greenhouse gas flux and its response to the Arctic Sea Ice Rapid Transition; 
    • Study the impact of sea ice melting process on carbon export flux in euphotic zone in Arctic Ocean; 
    • The response of the process of nutrient salt in Arctic Ocean to environment change; 
    • The function of composition and control of nutrient salt’s structure of sea water to biological pump; 
    • The distribution of POPs and ecological effect; 
    • Primary production in Arctic Ocean and its response to Sea Ice Rapid Transition; 
    • The biocommunity of sea ice and its characteristics of change; 
    • The community distribution and change of phytoplankton and zooplankton and marine benthos and nekton; 
    • The evolving of ecosystem in Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea in geological history; 
    • The impact of materials from river to sea on the ecosystem of continental shelf and basin in geological history. 

5. The achievement 
The Expedition enjoys the achievements as follows:
    • Arrived in North Pole by helicopter and carried out several programs there ; 
    • Travelled over Canadian Basin area and conducted programs ; 
    • Recovered sub-merged buoys successfully; 
    • Obtained data and samples in some area; 
    • A fruitful results in the research of marine plankton; 
    • Prominent outcome in the investigation of nekton; 
    • A broad sampling of sediments; 
    • Good international cooperation.
