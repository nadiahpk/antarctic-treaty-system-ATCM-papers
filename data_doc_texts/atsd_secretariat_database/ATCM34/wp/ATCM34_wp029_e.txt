Revised management plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 167, Hawker Island, Princess Elizabeth Land
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
Australia has conducted a five-yearly review of the management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) 167, Hawker Island, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. Australia recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised management plan.
Background
In accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia conducted a five-yearly review of the management plan for ASPA 167 Hawker Island, Princess Elizabeth Land. The review was conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (both the original version appended to Resolution 2 (1998) and the revised version under development by the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans). 
ASPA 167 Hawker Island (68°38’S, 77°51’E) is located approximately seven kilometres south west of Australia’s Davis station, off the Vestfold Hills in East Antarctica. The island was designated as ASPA 167 under Measure 1 (2006), following a proposal by Australia, primarily to protect the southernmost breeding colony of southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus). The Area is one of only four known breeding locations for southern giant petrels on the coast of East Antarctica, all of which have been designated as ASPAs. Hawker Island also supports breeding colonies of Adélie penguins (Pygocelis adeliae), south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki), Cape petrels (Daption capense) and occasionally Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii).
Summary of amendments
A revised management plan for ASPA 167 is provided at Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures. The amendments are summarised as follows:
    • an introduction has been added, including a statement of the primary reason for designation;
    • the provisions in Section 3 and Section 7(i) relating to access to the Area have been modified. The management plan previously allowed the issue of only one permit every five years to conduct a census of the southern giant petrel colony. The plan now encourages the conduct of censuses using techniques that typically would not require access to the Area during the breeding period;
    • a reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to Section 6(i);
    • the conditions in Section 7(ii) for accessing the Area have been updated to address the use of fixed-wing aircraft;
    • a requirement that visitors take precautions against the introduction of alien organisms to the Area, and guidance on appropriate precautions, has been added to Section 7(x); 
    • the list of supporting documentation in Section 8 is updated with several relevant recent publications; 
    • improved maps are incorporated; and
    • a range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans and with the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
Recommendation
Australia recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised management plan for ASPA 167 Hawker Island, Princess Elizabeth Land (Attachment A).
