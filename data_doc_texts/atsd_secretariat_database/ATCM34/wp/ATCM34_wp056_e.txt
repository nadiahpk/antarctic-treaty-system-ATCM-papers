Ensuring safety of shipping in Antarctic waters adopted in the Russian Federation
In recent years, the international Antarctic community has become strongly concerned with the increased frequency of accidents of marine vessels in waters of the Southern Ocean occasionally resulting in environmental emergencies. So, some countries regularly navigating in these waters proposed that the other Antarctic Treaty Parties should use experience of safe shipping gained in their marine state institutions. Russia as a country, which also has vast experience of Antarctic shipping presents this document with the aim to acquaint the countries, which only begin their practical activity in marine shipping in the Antarctic, with Russian knowledge and experience 
Russian (Soviet) mariners began regular voyages in Antarctic waters in the summer season 1946-1947, when the Soviet whaling flotilla “Slava” embarked on its first Antarctic cruise. Experience of operating in drifting polar ice allowed Soviet seamen to quickly adapt to the Antarctic conditions and masterfully sail in the new regions of the global ocean. In some years the whaling ships could even directly approach to the shores of Antarctica. In the 1960-1970s, three Soviet whaling flotillas from Odessa, Vladivostok and Kaliningrad were engaged in whaling in Antarctic waters.
In November-December 1955, new stage of Soviet shipping in the Antarctic began when the diesel-electric ships “Ob” and “Lena” of the Murmansk Shipping Company went on their maiden voyage to the shores of the sixth continent with the First Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE) onboard. Next year they were joined by the ice class transport ships from the Northern (Arkhangelsk) and Far Eastern (Vladivostok) shipping companies. Due to increasing number of tasks and personnel, SAE began regular use of passenger ships (from 1959), tankers (from 1966) and research vessels (from 1967) for support of the expedition operations in addition to ice-strengthened vessels. 
In early 1968, a specialized Expedition Fleet Base was established at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI, Leningrad), and its ships and specialists began regular voyages to the Antarctic participating in the next SAE. In 1975 and 1987 by the decision of the USSR Government the research-expedition vessels “Mikhail Somov” and “Akademik Fedorov” were constructed for support of SAE activity. These ships have a strengthened ice hull allowing them to overcome ice up to 1.5 m thick, an electrical-mechanical type of motion and they were intended for delivery of supply cargos to Soviet (Russian) Antarctic stations, including fuel and food products, transportation to the Antarctic and back of more than one hundred of expedition participants, stationing of deck helicopters onboard and conducting en-route scientific observations. These characteristics significantly distinguished the research-expedition vessels from the research vessels. Both ships were transferred to the AARI Expedition Fleet Base. On 24 March 2011, a new research-expedition vessel the “Akademik Treshnikov” was launched in St. Petersburg for support of RAE. It is to be introduced into operation in 2012.
In addition to the aforementioned shipping companies, specialists of the Baltic, Black Sea and Primorsk shipping companies began operation in the Antarctic waters. In the season 1968-1969, active fishery of seafood began in the Southern Ocean by the Soviet fishing vessels, which were restricted in their southward advance by the edge of drifting ice belt. In some years the total number of vessels sailing under the Soviet flag in Antarctic waters was more than a hundred. Such a quantitative increase of the number of Soviet ships in the Antarctic has required a wide introduction of new technologies of hydrometeorological, ice, hydrographic and telecommunication support for shipping in this region of the global ocean, and specialized training of the ship crews to operate under the severe natural conditions. 
In the early 1990s due to significant political-economical changes after collapse of the USSR, up to ten Soviet research, hydrographic and icebreaking vessels sailing under the Russian flag, set about a new activity and still continue it. This is organization of marine tourism in the Antarctic. 
The Soviet (Russian) seamen continued to actively use their Arctic experience of ice navigation and well checked arrangements for providing information and prognostic support in the Antarctic. 
In the early 1990s, the size of Russian shipping in the Antarctic has significantly decreased. However the main principles for ensuring safety of ice shipping still existed.
In the 1990s the ships of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) had to provide support for life-sustaining activities of their Antarctic stations at the beginning of the winter season (April-May). In spite of heavy ice navigation conditions, these expeditions allowed us to gain invaluable experience of operations under the conditions of winter Antarctic showing a possibility of operations even at such critical time. On 12 February 1992, the first Russian-US drifting research ice camp was organized in the Weddell Sea by the research-expedition vessel “Akademik Fedorov” and after successful operation, it was evacuated by the same ship at the beginning of June. In the early 2000s, the “Akademik Fedorov” began regular navigation (every two years) around the Antarctic continent, operating practically in all seas of the Southern Ocean. So, the Russian (Soviet) mariners have gathered a wealth of experience of navigation in all Antarctic seas in different seasons of the year including approaches to different onshore points for the purpose of disembarkation or resupply of research stations and seasonal field bases.
The current system of training senior officers of the Russian vessels is based on the following main principles:
    • Ship masters should have marine education at a university level with specialization in “navigation at sea routes”. The masters without experience of work in the Antarctic are sent as chief mates or stand-in masters to get acquainted with the ship and its performance capacity. At the favorable report on their work and personal characteristics, they can be recommended and appointed as masters. Second, third mates, etc. (mates-on watch) are employed at ships after graduation from the higher marine universities, naval and marine colleges. 
    • Marine engineers and electrical officers are also hired after graduating from marine education institutions.
    • Master’s mate on radio-electronics for servicing radio-navigation equipment is employed after graduating from a radio-technical faculty of marine   education institutions.
    • Sailors, motor-men, electricians are hired after graduating from marine colleges or special courses.
    • Servicing personnel are employed after graduating from a special college, and they can also be employed by free recruitment.
All crew members are trained every 5 years at the onshore training centers, receiving corresponding certificates, and annually undergo medical examination for the right of work onboard ships.
The employed crew members should:
    • - correspond by age (not younger than 18 years old);
    • - pass job interview with main specialists to determine professional suitability;
    • - pass exam on safety onboard ships and health regulations;
    • - learn his/her position description;
    • - learn duties onboard ship in respect of ship alarms and be able to fulfill them;
    • - fulfill ship rules;
Crew members should have:
    • Certificate of service or certificate by profession;
    • SOLAS certificate;
    • Medical history sheet with a mark of passing medical examination;
    • National seaman identification or seaman book;
    • International passport.
Senior officers recommended for a higher position take special courses. 
Diploma and certificates are renewed every five years after taking the courses.
Working onboard ships in the Antarctic differs significantly from standard voyages along sea lines of communication. This is a single voyage under the storm and ice conditions in the regions inadequately studied in hydrographic respect, mooring and unloading to the unequipped shore, landfast ice and ice barrier.
Loading/unloading cargo operations at the Antarctic shores are carried out by ship crews. The entire crew should have skills to work onboard the research vessel in close contact with the expedition team. This is a big difference compared with the crews of trade fleet ships. 
The ice navigation conditions in the Southern Ocean were generalized in the monograph of Dr. A.A. Romanov (AARI) published by WMO in a series “Marine Meteorology and Related Oceanographic Activities”, report No. 35, WMO/TD-No.783, 1996 in all WMO working languages. The operational hydrometeorological ice information and short-range forecasts of its variability are prepared by the ship scientific-technical service using additional satellite images sent to the ship from the AARI or from the Russian Antarctic stations Bellingshausen, Novolazarevskaya, Progress and Mirny. The long-term ice forecasts for planning dates of ship operations are prepared at the AARI scientific departments, which are updated on a monthly basis and are sent to the ship via the communication channels. The hydrographic support for ships is provided by means of published navigation charts and operational sea depth measurement data prepared by the hydrographic team annually working onboard the ship. 
 The adopted system of training ship crews and experience of ice navigation allowed us to have a large number of highly qualified polar masters, ship officers and ice experts (ice pilots) ensuring safety of shipping in the Arctic and the Antarctic. Russian experience of ice navigation was used by different National Antarctic Programs, chartering Russian vessels and for ice navigation support in the Antarctic for ships from China and the Republic of Korea.
