Progress Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Review of ATCM Recommendations





Progress Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Review of ATCM Recommendations
Introduction
During the 33rd ATCM, following a presentation by the Secretariat of SPs 5, 6 and 7 reviewing the status of the ATCM recommendations on Protected Areas, General Environmental Issues and Operational Matters respectively, and a presentation by Uruguay of WP 20 on recommendations on Operational Matters in particular, Argentina and Germany introduced WP 51 as a concrete proposal to continue the review of ATCM recommendations intersessionally. 
The meeting agreed on establishing an Intersessional Contact Group, coordinated by Argentina, with the following Terms of Reference:
“1) To examine and review the status of recommendations on:
• Protected Areas and Monuments
• Operational Matters
• Environmental Issues other than Area Protection and Management

Observers, as indicated in Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure and invited experts to the ATCM, as indicated in Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and the Final Report from ATCM XXXII paragraph 333), would be invited to participate. Consideration will be given to the work undertaken by the Secretariat and presented in SP 5, SP 6 & SP 7;

2) To elaborate a work plan to undertake consideration of each of the above referenced topics;

3) To provide an initial status report to ATCM XXXIV with a proposal as to which recommendations could be designated as no longer current, and include any suggestion to seek the advice of the CEP.”

The ICG engaged in three rounds of discussions of the proposal of SP 5 on the review of recommendations on Protected Areas, and SP 7 on recommendations related to Environmental Issues Other than Protected Areas. Given the technical nature of many of the recommendations on Operational Matters, the group decided to consider them during the next intersessional period if the 34th ATCM agrees with this proposal. 
The following Parties participated in the ICG: Argentina (convenor), Australia, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Uruguay.
Argentina thanks cooperation of Parties and the support of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty in this instersessional review.
Discussion
1. Review of the Status of ATCM Recommendations on Protected Areas and Monuments
Based on the proposal presented by the Secretariat in SP 5 at ATCM XXXIII, and having considered the update as a result of the measures adopted at that meeting, the group discussed the status of the recommendations related to Area Protection and Management.
This set of recommendations was grouped into three categories: 
    i. Protected area designation or review of PA management plans;
    ii. Extension of the expiration dates of management plans and 
    iii. General recommendations concerning area protection and management.
The group proposed to advise the ATCM to consider designating the following three categories of recommendations as no longer current:
i.- Recommendations related to the review of PA management plans. 

Table 1 shows the recommendations designating or modifying specific protected areas that have been replaced by subsequent measures.

1 As the areas in question have all been replaced, first by SSSIs and then by ASPAs, this measure is no longer current. 
2 Recommendation XVI-5 did not enter into effect, but the Management Plan for ASPA 126 attached to XVI-5 was replaced in Measure 1 (2002), which did.  
*Measures that have not yet become effective

ii. Recommendations related to the extension of the expiration dates of management plans
The group concluded that those recommendations on the extension of expiration dates that have already passed can clearly be designated as no longer current. They are listed in Table 2:

iii. General recommendations concerning Area Protection and Management

Recommendation 
Subject 
Comments 
Recommendation VI-8 
Permit for entry to Specially Protected Areas 
This measure prohibits entry into a Specially Protected Area, except in accordance with a permit issued under Articles VI and VIII of the Agreed Measures on Fauna and Flora. It was superseded by the permit procedures established in Annex V to the Environmental Protocol. 
Recommendation VII-9 
List of Historic Sites and Monuments 
The List of Historic Monuments attached to this Recommendation was superseded by the revised list agreed under Measure 3 (2003). 
Resolution 5 (1996) 
Revised numbering of Antarctic Protected Areas 
The list of ASPAs attached to this Resolution was replaced by the list attached to Decision 1 (2002). 

2. Review of the Status of ATCM Recommendations on Environmental Matters other than Area Protection and Management
During its second round of discussions the group analysed recommendations contained in SP 7, presented by the Secretariat at the 33rd ATCM. The analysis was performed according to the subcategories provided by the Secretariat in its paper. All participants agreed that several recommendations should be designated as no longer current, while others required additional analysis by the ATCM or further advice from experts such as the CEP, SCAR or COMNAP, before taking a definitive decision on their status.
These sub categories analysed were:
i. Environmental Impact Assessment
All participants agreed that the following recommendations should be designated as no longer current:

Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. XIV-2 
Human Impact on the Antarctic Environment: Environmental Impact Assessment 
Procedures For Environmental Impact Assessment of Activities in Antarctica

Adopted; 
Replaced by Resolution 1 (2005) 
R 1 (1999) 
Guidelines for EIA in Antarctica 
EIA Guidelines 
Adopted; 
Replaced by Resolution 4 (2005) 

Although SP 7 suggested that Recommendation XII-3 could be superseded by the procedures of Annex I to the Environmental Protocol, some participants noted that the third operative paragraph refers to an invitation to SCAR to offer scientific advice regarding the definition of categories of activities which have a significant impact on the environment; and this is not specifically included in Annex I. They noted that cooperation with SCAR is of a permanent nature and therefore, before taking a decision on the status of this recommendation, it would be convenient to consult SCAR and the CEP about this matter.

Effective 27/04/2004; 


Similarly, most of the participants of the group agreed on giving further consideration to Recommendation XIV-3, since it proposes “Guidelines for Scientific Drilling in the Antarctic Treaty Area” which include more detailed requirements for drilling activities than Annex I. Therefore, these guidelines are supportive in the planning and conducting of such scientific activities.

ii. Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora
In this category SP 7 identified several groups of recommendations. The first refers to recommendations related to the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora. The ICG proposes to designate as no longer current the following recommendations:
Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. I-VIII 
None 
Recognition of the need of measures for the conservation of Antarctic living resources. Includes General Rules of Conduct for Preservation and Conservation of Living Resources in Antarctica as a model to be adopted voluntarily. 
Effective 30/04/62; 
Superseded by the Environmental Protocol, in particular Annex II 
Rec. II-II 
None 
Continuation of I-VIII. Parties to exchange information and consult on the establishment of international agreed measures. 
Effective 11/01/63; 
Superseded by the Agreed Measures and the Environmental Protocol, Annex II 
Rec. IV-19 
Implementation of Article XII (1) (D) of the Agreed Measures 
Form for annual reports on species killed or captured. 
Effective 01/11/82 
Superseded by Resolution 6 (2001) on Information Exchange and Appendix 4 of the Final Report of ATCM XXIV 
Rec. VII – 5 
Importation of laboratory animals and Plants 
Recommends the inclusion of the words “including viruses, bacteria, yeasts and fungi” in Article IX of the Agreed Measures 
Effective 10/02/88; 
Superseded by Annex II (Article 4.6) 

One participant expressed certain doubts regarding the fact that Recommendation III-VIII (The Agreed Measures themselves) is completely superseded by the Environmental Protocol, noting that some specific requirements of the Agreed Measures are not specifically mentioned in Annex II or Annex V to the Environmental Protocol (for example, Article VI, paragraph 1, which refers to the prohibition of any attempt to kill, wound, capture or molest a native mammal or bird). Therefore, the participant suggested that before taking any decision on the status of this recommendation, the advice of the CEP would be required.
Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. III-VIII 
Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora 
Regulations to prohibit killing, wounding, capturing or molesting of any native mammal or native bird, except in accordance with a permit. Special regulations for Specially Protected Species and Specially Protected Areas. Prohibition of the importation of non-indigenous animals or plants into Antarctica. 
Effective 01/11/82; 


In a similar way, some participants also expressed that Recommendation III-X, recommending Parties to encourage SCAR to continue its interest in those matters and to prepare occasional reports on the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, could be still valid, because there is no comparable regulation about the cooperation with SCAR in Annex II of the Protocol.  SCAR and the CEP should be consulted before a decision is taken.
Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. III-X 
Interest of SCAR in the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora 
SCAR encouraged to continue its interest in conservation of fauna and flora, and to report on these matters, especially on matters that it considers should be listed in the Annexes of the Agreed Measures 
Effective 27/07/66; 



A second group of recommendations on the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora identified in SP 7 were those related to Specially Protected Species. On this issue all participants in the ICG agreed that the following two recommendations should be designated as no longer current:

Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. IV-16 
Specially Protected Species: Fur Seals 
Recommends that governments insert all species of genus Arctocephalus in annex A of the Agreed Measures. 
Effective 01/11/82; 
Superseded by the Environmental Protocol (Annex II) and could be considered as spent given Measure 4 (2006) 
Rec. IV-17 
Specially Protected Species: Ross Seal 
Recommends that governments insert the species Ommatophoca rossi in Annex A of the Agreed Measures. 
Effective 01/11/82; 
Superseded by the Environmental Protocol (Annex II) 

A group of four precursor recommendations of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) were proposed as superseded in SP 7. Although most participants agreed on this, one member of the ICG noted that not all Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties are also CCAS Parties, and that the views of non-CCAS Parties should also be considered regarding whether or not these recommendations were valid for them (e.g. Rec.V-7). 
In the particular case of Recommendation IV-22, some members suggested that the CEP and SCAR should be consulted on its status.
Rec. 
Title

Rec. IV-22 
Interest of SCAR in Antarctic pelagic Sealing 
Recommends that governments encourage SCAR to continue its interest in these matters and especially on the matters that SCAR considers should be listed in the Annexes to the Interim Guidelines 
Effective 30/10/68; 
Superseded by the CCAS. Could the first part still be considered valid? 
Rec. V- 7 
Concerning the proposals of SCAR for the revision of the Interim Guidelines for the Voluntary Regulation of Pelagic Sealing 
Recommends that until a decision is taken on the conclusion of an international Convention, they should voluntarily take account of the proposals of SCAR in its report to the National Antarctic Committees in 1968 on the modification of the "Interim Guide Lines for the Voluntary Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing" … 
Effective 31/07/72; 
Superseded by CCAS
Is the Recommendation still valid for non-CCAS Parties?  

Finally, the group agreed that Recommendation VI-9 on the exchange of information on fauna and flora can be designated as no longer current:

Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. VI – 9 
Data on the Conservation of Fauna and Flora 
Recommends that governments transmit information exchanged under Recommendation IV-20 and that they invite SCAR to assemble that information and to arrange its publication. 
Effective 01/11/82; 
Superseded by the Environmental Protocol and recommendations related to information exchange: Res. 6 (2001) and Decision 10 (2005)

iii. Waste disposal and management
The ICG agreed that the following two recommendations on this matter could be designated as no longer current, because they are superseded by the provisions of Annex III to the Environmental Protocol:

Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. XII-4 
Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment: Code of Conduct for Antarctic expeditions and Station Activities 
Recommends that Governments seek advice on any problems which have been experienced in implementing the Code of Conduct for Antarctic Expeditions and Station Activities; and that it be revised, particularly considering the increased potential for on-site treatment and removal of waste from the Treaty Area. 
Effective 27/04/04; 
Superseded by the Environmental Protocol and Annex III 
Rec. XV-3 
Human Impact on the Antarctic environment: Waste Disposal 
Procedures for waste disposal and management in Antarctica 
Not yet effective; 
Superseded by Annex III to the Environmental Protocol 

However, referring to Recommendation XIII-4, originally listed in SP 7, although it could be considered superseded, some members noted that it would be useful to bring the issue to the attention of the CEP for consideration of whether to seek new expert advice on the operation of Annex III of the Environmental Protocol.

Rec. 
Title 
Subject

Effective 27/04/04; 


iv. Prevention of Marine Pollution
The ICG proposes that the following two recommendations be designated as no longer current:

Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. IX-6 
Oil Contamination of the Antarctic Marine Environment 
Recommends that governments prepare reports on the pathways of contamination and proposals to reduce marine contamination, determine baseline levels of contamination, and consider these

Spent
Rec. XV-4 
Human Impact on the Antarctic Environment: Prevention, Control, and Response to Marine Pollution 
Procedures on the prevention of marine pollution 
Not yet effective; 
Superseded by Annex IV to the Environmental Protocol 

Some members noted that the status of Recommendation X-7 may be worth further consideration by the CEP, since its operative paragraphs providing encouragement to undertake relevant studies and monitoring have not been directly superseded and may be of continuing relevance, for example, in ongoing discussions about emergency response to and liability for environmental damage. However, the Recommendation is outdated and may benefit from being updated to take into account the relevant scientific advances and experience with significant oil spills that have occurred since 1979.
Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. X-7 
Oil Contamination of the Antarctic Marine Environment 
Recommends that governments take note of Section III of the Report of Ecological, Technological, and other Related Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in Antarctica (Washington, 1979), annexed to the Final Report of the Tenth Consultative Meeting; and that they be prepared to discuss this matter further at the Eleventh Consultative Meeting. 
Effective 08/04/87; 


v. Precursors to the Environmental protocol
The group agreed that the following four recommendations should be designated as no longer current:




Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. VIII-11

vi. SCAR advice on environmental issues
The following two recommendations should be designated as no longer current:
Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
Rec. VI-4 
Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment 
Recommends that governments invite SCAR to advise on human impacts, encourage scientific research on this issue, take interim measures to reduce human impacts, and reconsider the issue at the 7th ATCM 
Effective 10/01/73; 
Spent
Rec. VII-1 
Man's Impact on the Antarctic Environment 
Asks parties to take note of the SCAR responses to Recommendation VI-4; to adopt those responses as voluntary guidelines and request SCAR through their national committees to continue work in preparation of the Eighth Consultative Meeting; 
Effective 29/05/75; 
Spent

Although  members agreed that Recommendation X-4 is probably superseded, not only by Annex V of the Environmental Protocol, but also through EIA requirements and Resolution 3(2001), it would be convenient to refer it to the CEP and SCAR for confirmation that they agree that these matters are being addressed in full through other instruments.

vii. Liability issues
Although SP 7 does not mention recommendations on this matter, some members of the ICG proposed that there are two recommendations that were procedural in the development of the Liability Annex and can now be considered spent.
Rec.

viii. Other environmental matters
The following two recommendations should be also designated as no longer current:

Rec. 
Title 
Subject 
Comments 
R4 (1995)

Cooperation among Parties in accordance with article 6 of the Environmental Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty 
Recommends that the ATCM XXIV discuss the potential for enhanced cooperation on environmental protection in Antarctica and that Peru coordinate preparations for the discussion of this issue prior to ATCM XXIV. 
Adopted; 
Spent

Finally, regarding the request for advice, members agreed that it would be preferable to finalise consideration of these Recommendations during the 34th ATCM, if possible. To this end, one proposal was an early request (i.e. during Week 1) by the Legal and Institutional Working Group for advice from the CEP on outstanding matters. An open-ended contact group of the CEP might then be established to consider any outstanding matters and advise L&I accordingly.
