Proposal for shortening the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings




Proposal for shortening the Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meetings
At the ATCM XXXIII, Norway noted that it was important for the ATCM to improve its efficiency and that consideration should be given to ways to make the meetings shorter. Based on lessons learned and given the effort, time and resources that went into the ATCMs, it felt that the time had come for an assessment of whether the meetings could be organised in a shorter and more efficient manner.
Recognising the importance of the work carried out at the meetings and the effective functioning of the ATCM, further improvements could be made by:
    • Shortening the meetings at both ends, e.g., starting on Wednesday of the first week, (with the meeting of the Heads of Delegation on Tuesday evening) and ending the ATCM by lunch on Thursday of the following week. This would give 6.5 effective meetings days (compared with today’s 10), and the opportunity to consider utilising part of the weekend in between if necessary.
Some initiatives would have to be considered to allow for a shortening of the total time allocated for the meeting, e.g.:
    • A general review and update of the agenda, including consideration of whether some of the ATCM agenda items could be merged or replaced by new items, or removed from the agenda; or
    • Whether there may be agenda items that could be handled every second year instead of on an annual basis.
    • Time used for presentations could be significantly reduced by assuming that IPs had been read in advance of the meeting, and that IPs were presented to the meetings only when considered necessary to inform the discussions at hand. Some IPs may be circulated intersessionally with no need to be considered at the ATCM. Some papers provided by experts who could not provide WPs to the meeting might need presentation.
    • For specific questions that may require more in depth discussions, substantial time for consideration may be provided by holding expert meetings (or meetings in other relevant forums). Furthermore, more extensive use of ICGs could also be considered in this context. The latter has been proven to work successfully for clearly identified specific issues.
In addition to shortening the length of the meeting, Norway felt that consideration could be given to how more time could be allocated to the ATCM for discussion of overarching/holistic issues.
Some suggestions put forward by Parties for consideration included:
    • The need to focus on the quality of the agenda/meeting by giving higher priority to fundamental issues such as science, environmental protection, impacts of climate change in Antarctica, tourism, coordination of ATS with other bodies.
    • Need to look closely at how to organise the meeting more efficiently.
    • Shortening the meeting should have positive budget implications.
    • Some issues should be given higher priority than others.
    • Need for long-term strategic planning.
    • Consideration of the structure of Working Groups.
    • Urge Parties to submit WPs jointly with other Parties, in order to increase consultation and build support for proposals before meetings.
    • Agreement that IPs not should normally be presented at meetings, but could be presented intersessionally. The exception could be that experts/observers who were not authorised to present WPs would be allowed to present IPs.
    • In order to keep the meetings within the time limits suggested, evening and weekend meetings/informal contact groups without interpretation might be used, if required.
    • Working towards paperless meetings, for example, starting with not printing those ATCM papers that are posted on the website in advance of an ATCM.
    • A  decision to be made in Buenos Aires and implemented for future meetings as soon as possible , taking into account the need to allow the host country sufficient time to alter administrative arrangements.
    • The holding of intersessional expert meetings.
    • The importance of keeping presentations brief.
It was recognised that this was an indicative list only, not exhaustive, of points which could be subject of consideration.
Regarding the CEP:
    • Explore whether the timing of the CEP meeting could also be revised, taking into account the need to ensure sufficient time to complete its agenda.
    • Ensuring translation of the CEP report in time for the ATCM meeting.
    • The importance of intersessional work as a means of diminishing the workload during the CEP meeting itself.
Proposal from Norway
In accordance with the consensus agreement reached at ATCM XXXIII (2010), the 35th ATCM (ATCM XXXV) in Hobart in 2012 will be held over an eight-day period. Based on the discussions at ATCM XXXIII Norway would like to propose that the ATCM meeting is further shortened from eight to 6.5 working days by starting on Wednesday of the first week, (with the meeting of the Heads of Delegation on Tuesday evening) and ending the ATCM by lunch on Thursday of the following week. A decision to have a shorter ATCM should be made effective no later than for ATCM XXXVI in 2014.
The length of the CEP meeting is unchanged as no decision was taken at ATCM XXXIII to reduce the length of that meeting. However, Norway would like to suggest that we also consider shortening the number of CEP meeting days as well by one day at the beginning. This would mean that CEP starts on a Tuesday, the same day as the ATCM Head of Delegation meeting.
As the arguments for the Norwegian proposal are largely consistent with those presented in the proposal by Australia for the 35th ATCM in 2012 (WP 8), it may be best to assess the effectiveness of the eight-day meeting in Hobart next year before discussing in detail possible approaches to further reducing the duration of subsequent meetings.

Notes:
    • This represents an approach to scheduling meetings of the CEP plus the working groups established in recent years (e.g. Tourism, Science and Operations, Legal and Institutional). It does not specifically provide for possible alternative or new groups (e.g. Climate Change WG or Shipping WG). However, if established, such new working groups could be inserted in place of the meeting time scheduled for the traditional working groups (perhaps most relevantly the Science and Operations WG).
    • Arranging the 6.5-day ATCM schedule to allow three days in the first week and 3.5 days in the second week would permit the CEP meeting to proceed as normal by starting two days before ATCM. This arrangement would: reflect that no decision was taken at ATCM XXXIII on reducing the length of the CEP meeting; maximise the chances of the Committee addressing its continuing high workload, with more than half of all meeting documents being considered by CEP in much less than half of the available meeting time; acknowledge that steps have already been taken to improve the efficiency of the CEP meeting; and avoid possible risks to the successful overall outcomes of the meeting that may arise if both the ATCM and CEP schedules were modified at the same time.
    • A joint session of the Tourism WG and Operations WG (e.g. to consider shipping issues, as in recent years) could be accommodated by drawing on the time allocated to these groups in the second week.
    • With reduced meeting time, it would be important to tightly manage the presentation and discussion of papers (e.g. possibly including an agreement that Information Papers will not be introduced or discussed, unless they directly support a Working Paper or in cases where the Rules of Procedure limit the author to only producing an IP. All announcements should be made in IPs, or if necessary by the chair.)
    • The proposed schedule provides that there will be no meetings during the intervening weekend to ensure that delegates and meeting support personnel (e.g. interpreters) have time to rest.
    • To ensure sufficient working time within the constraints of a 6.5-day schedule, the traditional SCAR lecture could be held in a lunch break or in the evening rather than during meeting working time.
