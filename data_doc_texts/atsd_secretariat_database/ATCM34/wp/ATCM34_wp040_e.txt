Strengthening Support for the Madrid Protocol
Abstract

On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol) the governments of France, Australia and Spain submit to the XXXIVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting a joint proposal to strengthen support for the Madrid Protocol by Antarctic Treaty Parties that are not yet States Parties to the Protocol.
Introduction
The Madrid Protocol was adopted on 4 October 1991 and entered into force on 14 January 1998.  For more than a decade, the Madrid Protocol has provided an international framework for the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment.  It is encouraging that there are currently 34 Parties to the Madrid Protocol.  However, with the Antarctic region continuing to face a range of environmental challenges, the Madrid Protocol remains important and relevant and should enjoy the support of all Antarctic Treaty Parties.
With this in mind, and continuing the leadership they demonstrated nearly twenty-two years ago, three former leaders, Michel Rocard (former Prime Minister of the French Republic), Robert Hawke (former Prime Minister of Australia) and Felipe González, (former President of Spain), approached the governments of France, Australia and Spain to propose renewed action on the Madrid Protocol. 
The statement at Annex A from Messrs. Rocard, González and Hawke proposes an initiative to encourage greater acceptance of the Madrid Protocol by Antarctic Treaty Parties that are not yet States Parties to the Protocol. 
The governments of France, Australia and Spain welcome the suggestion of these eminent individuals.  During the coming year, each of the French, Australian and Spanish governments intends to make diplomatic representations to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties, but not yet States Parties to the Madrid Protocol, to invite these States to commit to accession to the Protocol.
	
Proposal 

France, Australia and Spain propose that the XXXIVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting:

    • appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet States Parties to the Madrid Protocol to commit to accession to the Protocol;

    • welcome the offer by France, Australia and Spain to make diplomatic representations to these States; and

    • invite France, Australia and Spain to report on progress of the initiative at the XXXVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. 
A draft Resolution follows.
Resolution XX (2011)
