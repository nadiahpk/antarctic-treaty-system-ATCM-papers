Revision of Site Guidelines for Whalers Bay, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands





Revision of Site Guidelines for Whalers Bay, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain and United States

    1. Whalers Bay (latitude 62° 59’S, longitude 60° 34’W) is located on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.  The Whalers Bay site comprises the semi-circular, gently sloping ash beach which is approximately 2 km in length and stretches from Penfold Point in the northwest to Cathedral Crags in the southeast.
    2. The entire site is recognised for its historical importance and has been adopted as Historic Site and Monument No.71 by means of Measure 3 (2003). The site also has important wilderness and environmental values, a number of bird species breed in the area, and several seal and penguin species use the beach as a resting place. Important or unique floral species and assemblages are present. 
    3. Site Guidelines for Whalers Bay were adopted in 2008.
    4. The Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management Group has revised the Site Guidelines for Whalers Bay, Deception Island (Annex 1).  Proposed relatively minor changes include:
    • Correction of minor typographical errors.
    • Clarification that the recommended landing site is in front of and adjacent to the floating dock.
    • Revision of the Cautionary Notes to improve clarity and warn that materials containing asbestos may be present at the site.
    • Revision of the map to improve clarity and accuracy: (i) in the map legend, ‘Helicopter landing site’ and ‘Field camp site’ have been changed to ‘National operator helicopter landing site’ and ‘National operator field camp site’, respectively, (ii) the closed areas have been marked more prominently and (iii) the boundary of HSM No. 71 has been realigned so that it does not encroach upon the boundary of Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 140 Parts of Deception Island, South Shetland Islands Site K – Ronald Hill to Kroner Lake.
Changes, except those correcting minor typographical errors, are highlighted in bold.
    5. The Deception Island ASMA Management Group recommends that the CEP submit the revised visitor site guidelines for adoption by the ATCM.
