Proposal of Modification for the Historic Monument No. 82
Installation of Commemorative Plaques at the Monument to the Antarctic Treaty

In 2007, during the XXX Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting held in New Delhi, Chile committed to install a commemorative plaque for the International Polar Years at the “Monument to the Antarctic Treaty” that had been erected near the Frei, Bellingshausen & Escudero bases, King George Island, Antarctica, according to what was set forth through Measure 3 (2007).
The monument was designed and built by the American Joseph W. Pearson, who offered it to Chile. It was unveiled in 1999, in the presence of the bases’ Managers, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the signature of the Antarctic Treaty. The monument is located midway between the two bases and the track leading to the ‘Villa Las Estrellas’ settlement.  It consists of a copper structure with 12 panels, each one paying homage to one of the signatory countries, and holding a copper globe. 
In order to fully honor the commitment that had been undertaken, in 2011 four plaques were installed, one for each of the official languages of the Antarctic Treaty System (Spanish, English, Russian, and French), bearing the following text:   “This historic monument, dedicated to the memory of the signatories of the Antarctic Treaty, Washington D.C., 1959, is also a reminder of the legacy of the First and Second International Polar Years (1882-1883 and 1932-1931) and of the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958) that preceded the Antarctic Treaty, and recalls the heritage of International Cooperation that led to the International Polar Year 2007-2008.”
”
On February 1, 2011 the Ambassador Fernando Schmidt, Chile’s Undersecretary of External Affairs, unveiled the International Polar Year commemorative plaques at the Monument to the Antarctic Treaty.

Proposal of Modification for the Historic Monument No. 82
Measure 3 (2007) states that the following monument shall be added to the listing of historic sites and monuments:
“No. 82,  Monument to the Antarctic Treaty and plaque. This Monument is located near the Frei, Bellingshausen and Escudero bases, Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (25 de Mayo Island), South Shetland Islands. The plaque at the foot of the monument commemorates the signatories of the Antarctic Treaty and the subsequent International Polar Years (1882-1883, 1932-1933, & 2007-2008).  Location: 62º 12´ 01” S, 58º 57´ 41” W, King George Island (25 de Mayo Island), South Shetland Islands.” 
Consequently with what is reported in the preceding paragraphs, we request that the wording of the Historic Monument No. 82 is modified in order to read as follows:
