On the need of constant monitoring of the values of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas
In 2002, Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty “Area Protection and Management” came into force. This document has become one of the basic components for preserving the Antarctic as a wilderness area, intended for peace and science. By Article 2, Annex V, “For the purposes set out in this Annex any area, including any marine area, may be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) or an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA)”.
According to Article 3 of Annex V, “any area, including any marine area, may be designated as an ASPA to protect outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, any combination of those values, or ongoing or planned scientific research.” Access to ASPA is permitted only in compliance with the permit issued on the basis of Article 7 of Annex V.
Article 4 of Annex V determines that “any area, including any marine area, where activities are being conducted or may in the future be conducted, may be designated as an ASMA to assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, improve co-operation between Parties or minimize environmental impacts”. “Entry into an ASMA shall not require a permit”. 
Article 8 of Annex V determines that “sites or monuments of recognized historic value which have been designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas or Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, or which are located within such Areas, shall be listed as Historic Sites and Monuments” (HSM).
According to the database of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, 71 ASPAs, 7 ASMAs and 85 historic sites and monuments were designated in the Antarctic as of April 2011. Based on these materials, a specific statistical analysis of such regions was performed. The ASPAs were designated by 15 Consultative Parties. The largest number of ASPAs was proposed by Great Britain (14), the USA (13), New Zealand (12), Australia (11) and Chile (8). The other Consultative Parties listed one to three ASPAs. 
In ASMA designation, of wide use is a method of joint management of the areass, which is implemented by several Consultative Parties. So, the USA participates in management of 5 ASMAs, Australia – 2, and Argentina, Brazil, Great Britain, India, Spain, China, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Russia, Romania, Chile and Ecuador – of 1 each. 
Seventeen Consultative Parties designated historic sites and monuments in the territory of the Antarctic. Of them, taking into account joint management, New Zealand designated 18, Chile – 13, Argentina – 12, Great Britain – 9, Australia – 6, Russia - 6, Norway – 4, France - 4, the USA – 3, India - 2, Belgium, Germany, Spain, China, Peru and Japan – of 1 each. 
These data show leaders in the international Antarctic community, which undertake most active steps to preserve for future of mankind the Antarctic environment, its natural values and dependent or associated ecosystems. 
Historically, designation of Specially Protected Areas (SPA) began in 1966, first Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) were designated in 1975 (after Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty became effective, all SPA and SSSI were listed as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and their names and numbers were correspondingly changed). The first HSMs were designated in the Antarctic in 1972, and the ASMAs – in 2004. In some cases, the areas referred to one category can include areas of the other category or partly coincide with them.
During the period 1966 to 2010, the number of such areas was annually changed as follows:

1966 – 16 ASPAs;
1972 – 39 HSM;
1975 – 1 SPA, 7 SSSI;
1979 – 1 SSSI;
1983 – 1 HSM;
1985 – 3 SPAs, 13 SSSI and 8 HSM;
1987 – 7 SSSI and 1 HSM;
1989 – 4 SSSI and 2 HSM;
1991 – 3 SPAs, 4 SSSI and 3 HSM;
1992 – 1 HSM;
1995 – 1 SPA and 11 HSM;
1996 – 1 HSM;
1997 – 3 SPAs, 1 SSSI and 1 HSM;
1998 – 3 SPAs and 1 HSM;
2001 - 2 HSM;
2003 – 2 ASPAs;
2004 – 1 ASPA, 2 ASMAs and 2 HSM;
2005 – 2 ASPAs, 1 ASMA and 2 HSM;
2006 – 3 ASPAs, 1 ASMA and 1 HSM;
2007 – 2 ASMAs and 1 HSM;
2008 – 3 ASPAs and 1 ASMA;
2009 – 1 ASPA and 2 HSM;
2010 – 1 HSM. 
 
As natural values, protected in the ASPAs, 50 values of living nature, 12 values of non-living nature and 9 complex values of living and non-living nature were simultaneously designated. 
All ASPAs, ASMAs and HSMs are extremely non-uniformly distributed. They are located in the following Antarctic areas given joint management by several countries: the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, a total of 65 (Australia -1, Argentina – 13, Belgium – 1, Brazil – 1, Great Britain -10, Spain – 2, China - 1, Korea – 1, Norway – 2, Peru – 2, Poland – 5, the USA – 9, Chile – 22, Ecuador – 1); the Ross Sea (including Ross Island), a total of 28 (Italy – 2, New Zealand – 20, the USA - 7); Victoria Land, a total of 17 (Australia – 3, Argentina – 1, Germany – 1, New Zealand – 10, the USA – 3); Princess Elisabeth Land, a total of 7 (Australia – 6, India - 1, China – 3, Norway – 1, Russia - 1, Romania – 1); Adelie Land, a total of 6 (France); Queen Mary Land, a total of 6 (Poland - 1, Russia - 4); Queen Maud Land, a total of 6 (India – 3, Norway – 1, Japan – 2); the South Orkneys, a total of 5 (Great Britain – 4); Mac-Robertson Land, a total of 4 (Australia); Wilkes Land, a total of 4 (Australia); the South Pole, a total of 3 (Argentina - 1, Norway -1, the USA - 1); Pensacola Mountains, a total of 1 (the USA); the Enderby Land, a total of 1 (Australia); Coats Land, a total of 1 (Argentina); Mary Bird Land, a total of 1 (New Zealand); the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility, a total of 1 (Russia); the South Geomagnetic Pole area, a total of 1 (Russia); Queen Maud Range, a total of 1 (Norway). 
These data show that coming into force of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty has not become a date of intensive increase of the listed ASMAs, ASPAs and HSMs. For the last 9 years, the number of such areas proposed by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting as special Measures remains approximately at the same level. This testifies to serious work undertaken by the Treaty Parties in preparing proposals to designate new ASMAs, ASPAs and HSMs. 
Paragraph 3, Article 6 of Annex V stipulates that “Designation of an Antarctic Specially Protected Area or an Antarctic Specially Managed Area shall be for an indefinite period unless the Management Plan provides otherwise. A review of a Management Plan shall be initiated at least every five years. The Plan shall be updated as necessary”. 
In our opinion, the review of ASPA or ASMA management plans, especially if the living nature values are values to be protected, must (on a mandatory basis) be based on the data on the state of protected values for which effective monitoring of corresponding key parameters of these values is necessary. This is required for understanding whether the measures taken are sufficient to preserve such living nature values. It is quite possible that change of the area boundaries or management measures adopted to protect these values will be required. For this purpose the Parties, which have submitted their specific ASPA or ASMA management plans must (on a mandatory basis) perform monitoring of such values and at least once in five years report to CEP about the results of such monitoring and preparation on its basis of revised management plans for such areas.
Article 12 of Annex V stipulates that this Annex may be amended or modified by adopting a special measure of ATCM, the draft of which can be prepared by CEP XV in 2012.
