On strategy for the development of the Russian Federation activities in the Antarctic for the period until 2020 and longer-term perspective
In accordance with the task of the Government of the Russian Federation (RF) of24 April, 2008,  the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring jointly with the interested bodies of the federal executive authorities and the Russian Academy of Science have developed a draft Strategy for the development of activity of the RF in the Antarctic for the period until 2020 and longer-term perspective (hereinafter, Strategy). The Strategy specifies the main areas of development of activity of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic. On 23 October 2010, the draft Strategy was considered at the session of the RF Government and on 30 October 2010, the RF Government approved the Strategy by its order. 
The objectives of the Strategy are to advance the national interests of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic in line with the norms and principles of the international law and Russian main domestic and foreign policies and to prevent (mitigate the consequences) potential threats that can be posed to these interests in the Antarctic. Achievement of the objectives will help to:
    • maintain the Antarctic as a zone of peace, stability and cooperation and prevent possible international tension sources as well as global threats of natural and climatic origin;
    • strengthen the economic capacity of Russia through the use of marine biological resources available in the Southern Ocean, and complex investigations of the Antarctic mineral, hydrocarbon and other natural resources; 
    • enhance the international prestige of the Russian Federation through large-scale political, social, scientific and environmental measures related to the activities of Russia in the Antarctic. 
To achieve the objectives of the Strategy it is necessary to address the following tasks: full assistance to maintaining and progressive development of the Antarctic Treaty System; development of integrated Antarctic research; assessment of the role and place of the Antarctic in global climate change; assessment of marine biological resources of the Antarctic on the basis of research on prediction of their expected amount to ensure cost-effective fisheries; geological and geophysical investigations of mineral and hydrocarbon resources on the continent of Antarctica and in surrounding seas; ensuring activities of the RF in space as they relate to the GLONASS system; protection of the Antarctic environment; modernization and reorganization of expedition infrastructure of the RF in this region.  
In considering each objective, the Strategy takes into account main provisions of the international law acts in force in respect of Antarctica, brief history of activity of Russia in this direction in the region, current problems and proposals on the methods of addressing them. 
The Strategy is suggested to be implemented in three phases with regard for the long-term planning and a complicated and multipurpose character of the development of activity of the Russian federation in the Antarctic. They are:
phase I - 2010 - 2013;
phase II  - 2014 - 2020;
phase III  - 2020 - 2030.
The major objectives of phase I are to:
    • retain the positions attained in the activity of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic;
    • put into operation a new wintering structure and a snow-ice airstrip at Progress station, as well as new supporting marine and aviation means; and
    • complete the events and programs initiated in the framework of the International Polar Year (2007/08).
The major objectives of phase II are to:
    • continue upgrading, technical re-equipment and reconstruction of the Russian expedition, transport and research infrastructure to study the Antarctic; and
    • conduct integrated inter-agency research in sparsely studied regions of the Pacific Antarctic owing to which Russia has a leading position in the international Antarctic community and the world science as a whole. This research also enhances the prestige of the state.
The major objective of phase III is to ensure the position of the Russian Federation as one of the world leaders in the Antarctic research.
On completion of phases II and III, a list of major activities and operations is to be specified.
The Strategy considers different risks that the Russian Federation can face in undertaking planned measures to implement this document. These include: macroeconomic risks related to the generally decreased world activity in the region and operational risks. Account of the influence of such events on the Russian activity in the Antarctic is considered in detail and options to solve the problems or minimize to the maximum their influence on such activity are proposed.
The major tool of the Strategy implementation will be the national program to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic (hereinafter referred to as “National Program”).
The National Program is to be developed by the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring in cooperation with the federal executive authorities concerned and the Russian Academy of Science.
The aim of the National Program is to realize the state interests of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic, provided that:
    • the Antarctic is only used for peaceful purposes;
    • equitable and mutually beneficial international cooperation of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic is established;
    • assistance is given to research and international scientific cooperation;
    • comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment is ensured;
    • safe activity in the Antarctic is ensured.
The participation of public authorities in the Strategy implementation is to be determined by the target programs in accordance with their powers. In developing federal and agency-level target programs, the coordination of activity and the interaction of federal executive authorities will be performed in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.
A number of target programs that realize the individual provisions of the Strategy are under way. 
The document proposes a List of major actions for implementation of the Strategy for the development of the RF activities in the Antarctic for the period until 2020 and longer-term prospective. It includes the following sections:
    • Construction and/or complete overhaul of RAE infrastructure facilities at Antarctic stations Progress, Novolazarevskaya, Bellingshausen, Mirny, Vostok and field bases Molodezhnaya, Russkaya and Leningradskaya; 
    • Creation of the field base for inland glaciological research and support of transport operations in the vicinity of Grove Mountains at the route from Progress station to Vostok station; 
    • Organization of new field camps to provide Russian geological and geophysical research and upgrading of existing field geological bases; 
    • Establishment of the Transport Operation Centre at Progress station; development of new inland routes; performing a complex of hydrographic, engineering and transport operations in the vicinity of the station; upgrading of snow-ice airstrips at Antarctic stations and field bases for new types of aircraft; trials and use of ski- and wheel-equipped aircraft; 
    • Conducting regular integrated fishing expeditions in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors of the Antarctic to estimate the resources of krill, fish and squids in these regions 
    • Completing construction and putting into operation of the new research vessel the “Akademik Treshnikov” for RAE; 
    • Designing and constructing the research-expedition vessel for RAE instead of the R/V “Akademik Fedorov”;
    • Designing and constructing two large-tonnage ice-class research vessels to conduct integrated fishing and oceanographic research; 
    • Upgrading of the R/V “Akademik Alexander Karpinsky” 
    • Preparing a technical and economic assessment of construction of a new research vessel 
    • Designing and constructing a new research vessel for geological-geophysical studies of the Southern Ocean;

    • Equipment of Roshydromet Antarctic stations and field bases with automatic meteorological and geophysical stations, hydrological sets, and digital systems for glaciological and synoptic data receiving from artificial Earth satellites, as well as with digital geophysical, magnetometric and seismic instruments, and satellite communication stations; 
    • Creation of a laboratory set for sterilization of measurement instrumentation and sampling of water and bottom sediments of subglacial Lake Vostok at Vostok station and a mobile glacier drilling complex by using alternative energy sources; 
    • Equipment of Roshydromet Antarctic stations and field bases with modern technological environmental instrumentation; 
    • Modernization of storehouses of fuels and lubricants at Roshydromet Antarctic stations and field bases; 
    • Development of the draft national program for protecting the interests of the Russian Federation in the Antarctic; 
    • Preparation of the draft RF governmental decrees on conducting the Russian Antarctic Expedition for the next five-year period and the Plan of Actions to ensure its activities.
The RF Program of scientific studies in the Antarctic is to be carried out after the end in 2013 of the Federal target program the “Global Ocean” and of some agency target programs of the interested federal executive authorities in the framework of the new Federal target program “Development of comprehensive studies of the Antarctic in 2014-2030”.
