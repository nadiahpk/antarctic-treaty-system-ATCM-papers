Progress report on ATME on Climate Change




Progress report on ATME on Climate Change
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom and Norway
Summary
The UK and Norway have developed this paper to facilitate the ATCM’s ongoing consideration of the conclusions and recommendations arising from the 2010 Climate Change ATME.  The summary table at Annex A records the actions taken to date against each of the 30 ATME recommendations, by the CEP and ATCM. The UK and Norway propose that the ATCM task the Secretariat to maintain and update this table to inform future discussions on the ATME recommendations, until they have all been closed.
Background
In April 2010, Norway and the UK jointly chaired an Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts in Svolvaer, Norway to consider climate change. The meeting, which included both political and scientific experts, produced a report including 30 recommendations, some of which were aimed at the ATCM, some at Parties and a few at CCAMLR.
 The report was considered at ATCM XXXIII and at CEP XIII, but only a small number of the recommendations were considered in detail. The recommendations relevant to CCAMLR were also raised at the SC-CAMLR-XXIV in October 2010 in Hobart, Australia.
In order to ensure that the important recommendations from this ATME are fully considered, and implemented as appropriate, the UK and Norway propose that the Secretariat be asked to keep the table in Annex A up to date.  The updated table would then be submitted by the Secretariat to the CEP and ATCM, under the relevant climate change agenda items, until each of the Recommendations has been closed. 
Recommendation
That the ATCM:
    1. ensures that the progress chart in Annex A reflects the latest position against each of the ATME recommendations; and 
    2. requests the Secretariat to maintain the table and provide regular updates to future CEP meetings and ATCMs.

Agenda Item
Other Notes
1
The ATME recommends that the ATCM acknowledge and welcome the SCAR ACCE report as an important resource for its own deliberations and as an input to the wider global climate negotiations, e.g. the UNFCCC. 

ATCM 33 adopted Decision 5(2010) providing the UNFCCC, IPCC, WMO and IMO with the SCAR ACCE Report and Resolution 4(2010) providing recommendations for Parties on dissemination actions.



2
The ATME recommends that the ATCM considers developing an Antarctic climate change communication plan to bring the findings of the ACCE report to the attention of other decision makers, the general public and the media. 

ATCM 33 agreed that this should be discussed at ATCM 34.


It has been noted that this could be included as part of wide ranging communications plan, and that it also is tied to recommendation 3.
3
The ATME recommends that the ATCM consider how best to provide information about Antarctic climate change to fora discussing and negotiating global climate change. 

ATCM 33 agreed that this should be discussed at ATCM 34.

The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to: 
• acknowledge and encourage continuing efforts in developing and exchanging experience of energy efficiency and alternative energy practices so as to promote reduction of the carbon footprint of activities in Antarctica and cut fossil fuel use from stations, vessels, ground transportation and aircraft; 
• solicit from COMNAP a report on progress on the implementation of its Best Practice for Energy Management – Guidance and Recommendations (endorsed by CEP X in Delhi), and ask for an update including details of best practices on energy efficiency and alternative energy deployment; and 
• welcome the efforts of IAATO in working towards developing best practice towards reducing the carbon footprint of its tour ships. 

CEP XIII agreed to add to their five year work plan and requested a report from COMNAP (CEP Report 371)
CEP 5

Recognizing the importance of emission cuts in Antarctica and their symbolic value in the global context, the ATME recommends that the ATCM encourage COMNAP to work with national programmes to use consistent methods to quantify and publish savings made by energy efficiencies, and which contribute to both (a) reducing carbon footprint, and (b) reducing fuel consumption and operating costs. 

To be returned to at ATCM 34.

In discussions at ATCM 33 COMNAP highlighted that they had an expert group on this subject and were intending to host a workshop on the subject in August 2010. (ATCM Report 427). 
6
The ATME recommend that Parties be advised to use atmospheric models to evaluate the wind regimes around their individual stations, to determine the potential for wind power as a means of cutting fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions. 

To be returned to at ATCM 34.


7
Welcoming the risk assessment approach taken by Australia to identify potential climate change implications for current and future Antarctic infrastructure, logistics and environmental values, the ATME recommends that Parties be encouraged to undertake and report on appropriate risk assessment processes. 


ATCM 33 encouraged all Parties to undertake risk assessments of their bases. (ATCM Report 429)

9
Noting that the WMO Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar Observations, Research and Services, promotes and coordinates relevant programs carried out in the polar regions, the ATME recommends that the Panel and others be urged to increase the refinement of Antarctic climate models, and the WMO be invited to provide regular reports to the ATCM to update Parties on progress with outcomes of the Committee’s activities. 

To be returned to at ATCM 34.


10
The ATME recommends that Parties be advised to expand research that will refine and enhance our ability to predict future climate change with increasing accuracy on various temporal and geographical scales; and to encourage steps to link scientific research efforts to the activities of operational agencies involved in providing climate services and other related activities. 

To be returned to at ATCM 34.

Given that the IPY has been very successful in significantly increasing the volume and interdisciplinary character of polar research, especially in relation to understanding climate change, the ATME recommends that national agencies be urged to maintain the momentum of that research as a key contribution to the IPY legacy. 

To be returned to at ATCM 34. 
CEP 5
Work on IPY legacy continues with a science meeting in Oslo, Norway in June 2010 and the planned IPY Conference due to be held in Montreal, Canada in May 2012. 
12
The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage the collaboration required to develop comprehensive and advanced integrated Earth System models capable of producing outputs at decadal scales and regional scales that can be used to assess the likelihood, timing and amplitude of climate change. 

To be returned to at ATCM 34.


13
The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage the space agencies to continue coordinated observations of the Antarctic region from space, in the context of improving the operation of observing systems for climate change, and to attend a future ATCM to give a demonstration of the use of modern space-based technologies for observing the Antarctic region in the context of climate change. 

To be discussed at ATCM 34.


14
The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to continue to strongly encourage collaboration and development of sustained integrated observing systems using in situ, air and space-based techniques. 

CEP XIII agreed to return to this at their next meeting. (CEP Report 387).To be returned to at ATCM 34.
CEP 5
The UK has submitted a WP to CEP XIV noting the potential for remote sensing to contribute significantly to future environmental monitoring programmes and other aspects of the CEP’s work.

15
Recognizing that Parties are obliged under the Treaty to share scientific data and information, and that there is a great deal to be gained from working more closely together on the collection of observations of climate change and its effects, the ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage greater collaboration in such collections, and to support access to such data through the Antarctic Master Directory. 

CEP XIII agreed to return to this at their next meeting. (CEP Report 387).To be returned to at ATCM 34.
CEP 5

16
The ATME recommends that Parties be requested to encourage national operators and SCAR to seek close cooperation and synergies with existing climate observing and assessment initiatives such as the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the IPCC. 

To be discussed at ATCM 34.


17
The ATME recommends that the ATCM encourages SCAR to incorporate identification of key regions, habitats and species at greatest risk from climate change effects into its research programmes. 

CEP XIII welcomed this recommendation and encouraged SCAR to take action. (CEP Report 349).
CEP 8c

18
The ATME recommends that ATCM and CEP give consideration to taking a more regional approach in the application of environmental management tools, in addition to the current continent-wide approach. 

CEP XIII agreed to consider again at next meeting. (CEP Report 373). To be discussed at ATCM 34.

Recommendation
ATCM/CEP Position
Agenda Item
Other Notes
19
The ATME recommends that the CEP consider developing a climate change response work programme. Such a work programme should attempt to incorporate, inter alia: 
• The need to continue to afford a high priority to the management of non-native species; 
• A classification of existing protected areas according to climate change vulnerability; 
• The need for more sophisticated and coordinated ecosystem monitoring, including the need for increased collaboration between CEP and SC-CAMLR; 
• A review of existing management tools to assess their continuing suitability in a climate change context (e.g. EIA guidelines (particularly with regard to planned long-term activities), Specially Protected Species guidelines, the guide to the preparation of management plans). 

CEP XIII added this objective to its 5 year work plan. (CEP Report 374).
CEP 5
The UK and Norway have submitted a WP to CEP XIV setting out a proposed methodology for classifying existing protected areas according to climate change vulnerability.
20
The ATME recommends that the ATCM and CEP encourage national Antarctic programmes to undertake marine and terrestrial biodiversity surveys and to submit, as a matter of urgency, all relevant biodiversity data to appropriate databases (e.g. the Biodiversity Database). In conducting such surveys, priority attention should be paid to regions considered to be at high risk of climate change impacts as well as to existing protected areas established to protect biological values. 

CEP XIII welcomed this recommendation and encouraged SCAR to take action. (CEP Report 349).
CEP 8c

21
The ATME recommends that the CEP give consideration as to means for improving climate change related data and information management to support its environmental management responsibilities. 

CEP XIII agreed to return to this issue at CEP XIV and requested additional thoughts from parties. (CEP Report 387).
CEP 5

22
The ATME recommends that the CEP consider: 
• using established methods of identifying a) Antarctic environments at high risk from establishment by non-natives and b) non-native species that present a high risk of establishment in Antarctica; 
• implementing non-native species monitoring protocols at areas of high risk, as well as at protected areas; 
• developing decision making tools to aid responses to identified establishments of non-native species. 


CEP 8a
This links in directly to recommendation 19 and should be considered as part of the same process.

23
The ATME recommends that Parties be encouraged to comprehensively and consistently implement management measures to respond to the environmental implications of climate change, particularly measures to avoid introduction and translocation of non-native species, and to report on their effectiveness. 


CEP 8a
CEP is conducting ongoing research into non-native species, including the effects of climate change.

Other Notes
24
The ATME recommends that CEP review the means of applying protected and managed area management tools to ensure sufficient flexibility to account for climate change effects. Such a review should consider: 
• the need to ensure that climate change effects are assessed during each five-yearly review of management plans, including for example, the need to establish protected and managed area boundaries that are climate change resilient; and 
• the potential to delist sites at which the original values to be protected have been lost or degraded. 

CEP XIII discussed the issue and the UK’s offer to work on this intersessionally toward CEP XIV.
CEP 7f

The UK and Norway have submitted a WP to CEP XIV.
25
The ATME recommends that the CEP consider a systematic approach to protected or managed areas to: 
• protect species, or habitats identified to be of particular risk to climate change consequences (cf. Recommendation 18); 
• accommodate areas that have potential to be environmental or climate refuges; 
• set aside areas for future climate change related research, including reference areas.
 
CEP XIII discussed the issue and the UK’s offer to work on this intersessionally toward CEP XIV.
CEP 7f
UK studies have highlighted that Antarctic marine species (invertebrates and fish) are less resistant to warming than species elsewhere.

26
The ATME recommends, recognising the responsibilities of and need to coordinate with CCAMLR, that the CEP consider, and advise the ATCM accordingly, as to means by which automatic interim protection might be afforded to newly exposed areas, such as marine areas exposed through ice-shelf collapse. 

CEP XIII discussed the issue and agreed to work intersessionally toward CEP XIV.
CEP 7f
Recent UK research has shown that coastal ice retreat is opening up new areas for biological productivity and that this has global significance (being the second largest natural feedback reducing CO2 build up).
These studies have also shown that such coastal ice retreat opens up new shallow habitats on the Peninsula for potential marine non native species.  (Relevant to recommendations 19 and 22). 

27
The ATME recommends that the CEP and SC-CAMLR be encouraged to ensure that sufficiently frequent biodiversity surveys and adequate monitoring programmes are established to provide an understanding of climate change induced responses in species distribution and abundance. 

CEP XIII agreed to return to both recommendations 27 & 28 at CEPXIV and work by the parties was encouraged. (CEP report 387). 

CEP 5

The UK highlighted these recommendations to the SC-CAMLR for attention in 2010. 
28
The ATME recommends that CEP and SC-CAMLR continue to develop means for collecting and sharing data and information on the status and trends of species of interest to both bodies (seals, penguins and seabirds), including the need to cooperate with other experts bodies such as SCAR and ACAP. 

CEP XIII agreed to return to both recommendations 27 & 28 at CEPXIV and work by the parties was encouraged. (CEP report 387).

The ATME recommends that the CEP remain alert to the development of climate change related conservation tools elsewhere in the world that may also have application in an Antarctic context (e.g. climate change adaptation plans, risk assessment tools and mechanisms for assisted translocation of endangered species). 

CEP XIII made note of the recommendation (CEP Report 375).
CEP 5

30
The ATME recommends that Parties consider making climate change a separate agenda item on the ATCM and CEP agendas. 

ATCM XXXIII made a decision in this regard (ATCM Report 541) and CEP XIII similarly (CEP Report 439).
