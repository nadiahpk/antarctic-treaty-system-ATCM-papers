The Assessment of Land-Based Activities in Antarctica





The Assessment of Land-Based Activities in Antarctica
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
With the forthcoming centenary of Scott and Amundsen’s expeditions to the South Pole, the interest in expeditions to the Antarctic interior appears to be increasing.  The traditional skiing/sledge pull traverses are, however, also diversifying to include vehicle-based expeditions, seasonal camps and more diverse endurance and adventure activities.  Based on recent experience of assessing such land-based activities, the United Kingdom proposes a checklist to assist with the assessment of these activities against the provisions of the Environmental Protocol and other relevant ATCM instruments.  The UK also proposes that the ATCM, in conjunction with the Committee for Environmental Protection, as appropriate, sets in hand a process to develop more detailed guidelines for those undertaking expeditions to the Antarctic interior.
Background
    1. One hundred years ago, Roald Amundsen and Captain Robert Falcon Scott set out on their epic expeditions to reach the South Pole.  Their journeys were arguably among the most epic and arduous ever undertaken, reaching a point so remote that no-one else was to follow for over 45 years.
    2. Nowadays, the South Pole has become an increasingly popular destination, and the wider Antarctic interior is becoming more accessible.  The use of all-terrain vehicles has become popular, both to support endurance ski events and races, as well as for sight-seeing across the ice plateau.  Seasonally established camps, such as those at Patriot Hills (Ellsworth Mountains), and in the Schirmacher Oasis, close to the Novo air base, provide direct access to the Antarctic interior, including as a base for a wider range of activities, such as ski-touring, climbing and remote camping, as well as more extreme sports (e.g. paragliding) and more traditional wildlife watching.  
    3. In considering applications from British nationals wishing to engage in such activities in Antarctica, the UK noted that whilst the ATCM has recently developed a range of guidelines for the assessment of more traditional cruise-based tourism and visitation of wildlife sites, there was little to draw on for these more diverse and developing activities within the Antarctic interior.   
    4. Whilst the Environmental Protocol provides for the environmental assessment of activities, Measure 4(2004) requires insurance and contingency plans, and Resolution 4(2004) sets out guidelines for the training and expertise of participants, there is no directly equivalent detail for interior expeditions, such as that set out in Measure 15(2009) for landings from passenger vessels, for example.  Whilst land-based expeditions are arguably more diverse, in the UK’s experience, there are common elements to the overall assessment of such expeditions.  We have sought to identify these and develop a checklist to support future assessment of such activities, and this is attached at Annex A.  (Please note that the checklist does not seek to address issues relating to the procedures or authorisations for how participants travel to or from the Antarctic Treaty area).  In developing this checklist, we have tried to build upon previous relevant discussions and initiatives taken by the ATCM, individual Treaty Parties and other bodies (e.g. IAATO’s observer checklist for land-based activities).  We would very much welcome the views of other Parties on this checklist, and would welcome wider adoption by the ATCM, in order to provide greater consistency to the assessment of such activities by competent authorities in the future. 
    5. As a second step, the UK would also suggest that developing more detailed guidelines for land-based expeditions would assist not only the assessment of such activities, but would also be beneficial to those planning such activities in the future.  For example, in the context of single expeditions in more remote parts of Antarctica, the UK considered that it was not appropriate to simply apply the passenger vessel landing limitations of 100 people ashore and ratio of 1:20 passengers.  Instead, the UK agreed much lower participation limits and guide ratios directly with the operators involved, based on a range of factors.  However, we also took into account that at some key locations (such as the South Pole), there may be several other expeditions, authorised by other Treaty Parties, on site at the same time and it would not be feasible to co-ordinate, or set site limitations in the Antarctic interior .  For consistency, and to aid future plans, therefore, it would certainly be useful to develop more specific and detailed guidelines on such issues, drawing on the range of Treaty Parties’ expertise.  If there was wider interest in taking such work forward, the UK would be pleased to work with other interested parties during the intersessional period, and to prepare draft guidelines for submission to ATCM XXXV.
Recommendations
    6. The UK would propose that:
    a. Parties provide views on the attached checklist (at Annex A) for the assessment of land-based expeditions;
    b. the ATCM considers adopting the checklist to provide for its consistent use, for example, through a Resolution (draft attached for consideration at Annex B); and
    c. the ATCM agrees to the development of more specific guidelines for the conduct and future assessment of land-based activities, in consultation with the CEP, as appropriate, for further consideration at ATCM XXXV.  

ANNEX A

Checklist for the Assessment of Land-Based Activities in Antarctica
The following checklist is designed to aid the assessment of land-based activities in Antarctica.  The checklist is not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive, and is focused specifically on the assessment of expeditions and activities to be undertaken within Antarctica (rather than on the assessment of operators of marine/aviation transportation into, out of and within, Antarctica).  Whilst the checklist has been written with the intention of providing a general overview of issues relating to land-based activities, inevitably not all of the checklist will be relevant to every expedition, and the requirements of those operating regularly in Antarctica will clearly be different to those conducting one-off expeditions.  However, overall, the aim of the checklist is to underpin the consideration of land-based activities to ensure full compliance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection and other relevant ATCM instruments, including Measure 4(2004), Resolution 4(2004) and Resolution 7(2009), as appropriate.
Environmental Assessment
    • Consider in particular, whether the proposed activities are consistent with the Environmental Principles, set out in Article 3 of the Environmental Protocol;
    • Ensure that the EIA covers all activities  proposed to be undertaken whilst in Antarctica (including those of any sub-contractors, as relevant to the land-based expedition) and including any alternative activities that may be offered because of weather restrictions etc; 
    • Consider whether those involved in the expedition, or the organisers if different, have previous experience of operating in Antarctica (or other similar environments), and the extent to which they implement, any industry best practice standards;
    • Consider specifying geographic boundaries for the expedition, to broadly limit where the expedition may operate within Antarctica.  This may include, for example, only areas about which the operator is able to demonstrate a good understanding, preferably gleaned from those with  direct prior experience (for example in terms of known crevasses, nunataks, potential wildlife concentrations or proximity to protected or vulnerable areas etc).  Alternatively consider whether protocols have been developed to guide conduct when unexpected features or hazards are encountered (e.g. no climbing of unspecified nunataks etc);
    • Require detailed fuel handling and spill avoidance measures, particularly where fuel is to be transported long distances, or where vehicles and aircraft are to be refuelled on the ice;
    • Scrutinise waste management practices, ensuring double-checking for any discarded waste from travelling expeditions (particularly in the context of ‘race’ events where temporary camps may be dismantled quickly) and that contingency plans include provision for the removal of all equipment in the event of an emergency evacuation from Antarctica;
    • Ensure that expeditions (and their sub-contractors, as appropriate) are fully aware of expected conduct in proximity to wildlife; even if they do not plan to be near to any known concentrations of wildlife and that they are familiar with the location of any protected areas in proximity to their intended activities.
Impact on other activities in Antarctica
    • Ensure that the expedition and proposed activities will not have a detrimental effect on scientific research, or scientific bases, for example, by ensuring appropriate liaison with other national programmes.  This is particularly important in relation to areas where it is likely that other expeditions will also be present (e.g. in proximity to entry airfields and at South Pole), in line with Resolution 3(2004).
Health and Safety
    • Ensure that the expedition has developed clear rules and operating procedures whilst in Antarctica, with detailed health and safety and communication plans;
    • For travelling expeditions, consider whether there is an agreed pre-planned (fixed) route, and whether there has been reconnaissance and mapping of the route;
    • For endurance and highly physical activities, consider the extent of prior training and preparation of all participants in line with the recommendations at paras 3, 5 and 6 of Annex I of Resolution 4(2004), irrespective of whether there are also on-site guides present;
    • Consider limiting the number of participants in land-based programmes, depending on the nature of the activities proposed, and consider the ratio of medically and specialist polar trained staff/instructors to novice, or less experienced participants.  Where applicable, ensure that sufficient staff/instructors are available to allow for appropriate rest periods for 24 hour events (e.g. ski races).
Medical, Search and Rescue and Evacuation Procedures
    • Assess insurance and contingency plans in line with Measure 4(2004), in particular, consider whether the insurance or other financial arrangements make specific reference to Antarctica and the types of activities for which the policy/arrangements covers;
    • Require a full risk assessment to be completed, linking to contingency plans for particularly high risk activities, or scenarios.  Ensure that the contingency plans cover, in particular, weather-related implications, medical emergencies, and equipment failures;
    • Consider whether there are standard operating procedures for accidents and emergencies, health and safety and the provision of medical/first aid;
    • Ensure that contingency plans include clear evidence of agreement/contracts with those providing medical back-up or search and rescue cover, and that those providers can demonstrate the capacity and competence to deliver;
    • In the case of search and rescue support for expeditions away from base camps, ensure clear agreed protocols and communication equipment and back-ups, for regular reporting (e.g. at least once per day) and the commencement of search and rescue if no communication is received after an agreed period of time;
    • Where applicable, ensure that activities are planned so as to ensure that any on-the-ground support teams are  always within an agreed minimum time or distance from all participants;
    • For endurance and highly physical activities, ensure clear arrangements are in place for access to medical support, regular monitoring of participants (e.g. at a series of checkpoints for travelling expeditions) and formal procedures for the withdrawal or removal of participants on medical grounds.
Use of vehicles
    • Consider how many vehicles are to be used, and whether they are suitable for the proposed terrain and activities planned.  What modifications have been made to the vehicles, what safety and medical equipment will they carry, will they be fitted with ground radar and other navigational equipment? Consider fuelling protocols, as part of overall environmental assessment;
    • Consider whether the vehicles provide sufficient capacity to support the proposed activities and ensure sufficient numbers of personnel are fully trained to operate the vehicles, including drivers and mechanics, and that appropriate spare parts are carried;
    • Assess the contingency and scenario plans, for example, how to deal with loss of one or more vehicles;
    • Consider proposed location of operation, in particular whether clear routes and itineraries are planned;
    • Consider setting speed and distance travelled limitations (for safety and environmental reasons), as well as requirements for maximum distances between vehicles (and, as appropriate, proximity to all participants on the expedition);
    • Ensure adequate contingency plans are in place for the recovery of vehicles (including in the event of a total evacuation of all personnel) and consider plans for removal of all vehicles and equipment out of Antarctica at the end of the expedition.
Temporary Camps
    • In addition to the general environmental assessment for the expedition, pay particular attention to waste management (including human waste) procedures.  In the case of travelling expeditions, particularly where temporary camps may be established and vacated quickly, ensure double-checking of removal of all equipment and garbage;
    • For seasonally established camps, consider arrangements for camp dismantling at end of season, including what, if anything, will be stored in Antarctica over the winter and how, and what the arrangements are for removal of all camp equipment in the event of a total evacuation, or a failure to operate in future seasons;
    • Consider camp operational and safety protocols, considering in particular, total area of operation, whether there will be any ‘free roaming’ areas, and arrangements for communication among all inhabitants at all times.
Education / Outreach
    • Assess how the expedition will focus on the enrichment and education of visitors, before and during the expedition, in line with Resolution 7(2009);
    • Consider whether the expedition will generate a wider interest in the protection of Antarctica, for example, through media interest, websites, schools outreach etc.
