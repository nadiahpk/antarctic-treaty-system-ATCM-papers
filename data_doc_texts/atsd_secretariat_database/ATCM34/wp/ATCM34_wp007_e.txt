Report of the intersessional open-ended contact group to consider the draft CEE for the “Construction and Operation of the Jang Bogo Station, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica”
Working Paper submitted by Australia 
Summary
An intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) was established in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs to consider the Republic of Korea’s draft comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE) for “Construction and Operation of the Jang Bogo Station, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica”. Participants congratulated the proponent for its efforts to identify and address the predicted environmental impacts of the proposed activity, including through the innovative low impact station design and modular construction system, the application of modern impact technologies for energy and waste management, and a range of other measures. The ICG determined that the draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection. Participants raised a number of issues for consideration by the proponent. In particular, the Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestions that the final CEE should provide further detail regarding: the possible cumulative impacts of activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region; the ancillary station infrastructure; the wastewater treatment system; the management of sewage and food wastes; oil spill prevention; measures to prevent impacts on the skua colony; measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species; and plans for decommissioning the station.
    1. Background
On 14 February 2011 the Republic of Korea notified the CEP Chair of the availability of the draft CEE for “Construction and Operation of the Jang Bogo Station, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica”. The draft CEE was prepared by the Korea Environment Institute, Chungnam National University and the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI). The full document was available for download from the websites of KOPRI (www.kopri.re.kr) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (www.mofat.go.kr). 
In accordance with the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs (Appendix 4 to the CEP X Final Report) the CEP Chair issued:
    • CEP Circular 7/CEP XIV (15 February 2008), which:
    • advised contact points of the availability of the draft CEE;
    • advised of the need to establish an open-ended intersessional contact group (ICG) to review the draft CEE;
    • proposed that Australia’s CEP representative, Mr Ewan McIvor of the Australian Antarctic Division, convene the ICG;
    • proposed terms of reference for the ICG; and
    • invited CEP Members to comment on the proposed convener and/or terms of reference.
    • CEP Circular 8/CEP XIV (3 March 2011), which noted that no comments had been received on the proposed convener or terms of reference.
Terms of Reference
No Member proposed consideration of additional matters, so the ICG addressed the three standard terms of reference outlined in the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs:
    1) The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.
    2) Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document.
    3) The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
Method of Operation
All ICG correspondence was available to CEP Members and Observers via the CEP Discussion Forum. The English language version of the full draft CEE was posted to the Discussion Forum, together with English, French, Spanish and Russian versions of the Non-technical Summary and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2005).
ICG participants were reminded by the CEP Chair and ICG convener of the CEP’s agreement that the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs do not detract from the right of any Party to the Protocol to raise an issue on a draft CEE at meetings of the CEP or ATCM.
The ICG commenced with an initial comment period from 4 March to 8 April 2011. The convener circulated a draft report for comment on 16 April and prepared a final report, addressing comments received, by the 6 May deadline for submission of Working Papers to ATCM XXXIV / CEP XIV.
    2. Summary of comments received from ICG participants
Comments were submitted to the ICG by nine CEP Members (Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom, United States) and one Observer (ASOC). Those comments are summarised below, under the relevant terms of reference, and each submission is available in full from the Discussion Forum.

    1. The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.
Participants agreed that the draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.
Cumulative impacts of activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region
Several participants noted that the proposed site for Jang Bogo station is in close proximity to existing facilities operated by Germany (approximately 1.2 km to the south) and Italy (approximately 8 km to the southeast). They suggested that the ‘consideration of cumulative impacts of the proposed activity in light of existing activities and other known planned activities’ (as required by Article 3.2(f) of Annex I) in the final CEE should be expanded to address the potential cumulative impacts associated with the conduct of science and operational activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region. It was also suggested that the final CEE should provide further detail about Korea’s plans for international collaboration on such activities. 
    2. Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document.
Participants agreed that the information contained in the draft CEE supports the proponent’s conclusion that the construction and operation of Jang Bogo station is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment. It was also generally agreed that the information provided supports the conclusion that the predicted environmental impacts will be outweighed by the knowledge and information to be gained through the research activities that will be supported by the station.
Participants noted that environmental considerations had clearly been a key consideration in the project planning, and expressed their support for many aspects of the proposed activity. Of particular note was the innovative design for the main station building, which employs a low impact modular construction system to minimise construction wastes, reduce footprint, and facilitate decommissioning. Participants also commended the proponent’s plans to utilise a suite of modern technologies for minimising energy requirements, generating renewable energy, and minimising atmospheric emissions.
Participants identified a number of matters for the proponent’s consideration when preparing the final CEE. The following section describes the most significant issues raised by many participants. Appendix A presents a summary of other points raised by one or more participants.
Description station infrastructure
Several participants noted that although the draft CEE provided a detailed description of the main station building and impacts associated with its construction and operation, the final CEE should provide further information about the full complement of station infrastructure, including: other major structures that account for approximately half the anticipated total building area (e.g. power plant, maintenance facility, storage buildings, emergency shelter, boat storage); scientific facilities (e.g. geophysics facility, upper atmosphere observatory, boundary layer observatory); other ancillary station infrastructure (e.g. heliport, antennae); and the site services  that will run between the station facilities (e.g. wires, pipe work).
Waste water treatment, re-use and discharge
The proposed state of the art system to treat and reuse grey water (Section 2.2.2.) was of considerable interest. However many participants suggested that the final CEE could usefully describe the system in greater detail, by identifying: the specification / design of the equipment to be used; whether the same system will be used during the construction and operational phases; the percentage of treated water that will be re-used on station, and for what purposes; the volume of effluent to be discharged (daily / annually); the likely quality of the ‘near pollutant-free’ effluent to be discharged; whether the waste treatment plant will require a full-time specialist operator; and what contingency arrangements will be in place if the plant fails.
Management of sewage and food waste
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should provide further information about the proponent’s plans to incinerate food waste and sewage sludge (Section 2.5.4, page 37), including: the likely volume and moisture content of these waste streams; and the method of reducing moisture content (particularly in sewage sludge) to a point where incineration would be efficient and effective.
Oil spill prevention
Several participants commented that the description of measures to prevent fuel and oil spills (Section 5.3.2, page 78) focuses on spills from the bulk fuel tanks and pipelines connecting facilities on the station. Given that lengthy floating hoses will be used during resupply to transfer fuel from the ship to the bulk storage tanks on station (Section 2.5.3, page 37), they suggested that final CEE should also describe the measures that will be employed to prevent, and respond to, any fuel spills.
Measures to prevent impacts to the skua colony
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should provide further information to clarify the predicted impacts on the skua colony, and the planned mitigation measures (Section 5.7, page 84). A range of aspects were raised for the proponent’s attention, including: whether the colony comprises breeding or non-breeding birds; whether construction activities could be reduced or avoided during the breeding period; what measures will be employed to prevent or restrict access to the colony during the period when skuas are present; what is meant by the ‘soft measures’ to encourage relocation of nests, and whether there is any evidence to suggest that such measures are likely to be effective; whether helicopters could be prohibited from overflying the colony; and how the planned monitoring of the skua colony will be designed to prevent further impacts on the birds. It was noted that further information on the status of the skua colony may have been obtained during the detailed biological survey conducted in February 2011. 
Measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species
Many participants suggested that the final CEE should describe in greater detail the measures to minimise the risk of introduction of non-native species during the operation of the station (Section 5.7.2, page 90). They further suggested that a discussion of the risks of introductions during the construction phase (e.g. associated with the transport of building materials, construction equipment, vehicles, food, other supplies and personnel) and mitigation measures should be provided. It was also suggested that measures for preventing the transfer of native organisms between Antarctic locations (i.e. between the regions surrounding King Sejong station and Jang Bogo station) should be identified and documented in the final CEE. The CEP Non-native Species Manual, currently under development, is likely to provide helpful guidance.
Decommissioning
Several participants supported that proponent’s plans to establish a detailed dismantling program will be established (Section 5.11, page 93), and suggested that it would be consistent with the scope of the activity, as outlined in Section 2.2.1 (i.e. construction, operation and dismantling of the station), to more clearly describe in the final CEE specifically what is expected to be removed from the site and what will be left in place after decommissioning. For example, it was noted that the precast concrete foundations used for the main building may assist decommissioning, but that the mat foundations planned for other facilities would be more difficult to remove.
    3. The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
The ICG determined that the draft CEE is clear, well structured, and well presented. Participants remarked that the many maps, photographs and figures greatly assist the reader to understand the proposal, and congratulated the proponent for preparing a detailed and high quality document.
Minor editorial suggestions are identified in Appendix B.
    3. Conclusions
Having reviewed the Republic of Korea’s draft CEE for the “Construction and Operation of the Jang Bogo Station, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica” in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs, the ICG advises the CEP that:
    1) The draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestion that the final CEE should provide further detail regarding the possible cumulative impacts of activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region.
    2) The information contained in the draft CEE supports the proponent’s conclusion that the construction and operation of Jang Bogo station is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment. The ICG also generally agreed that the information provided supported the proponent’s conclusion that these impacts will be outweighed by the knowledge and information to be gained through the research activities that will be supported by the station.
When preparing the required final CEE, the proponent should consider, and address as appropriate, the comments raised by ICG participants. In particular, the Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestions that the final CEE should provide further detail regarding: the possible cumulative impacts of activities by multiple operators in the Terra Nova Bay region; the ancillary station infrastructure; the wastewater treatment system; the management of sewage and food wastes; oil spill prevention; measures to prevent impacts on the skua colony; measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species; and plans for decommissioning the station.
    3) The draft CEE is clear, well structured, and well presented. 
Appendix A. Other points for which one or more ICG participant suggested clarification was required or desirable
    1. Introduction
    • The scientific justifications for establishing Jang Bogo station (Section 1.3, page 7) could be improved in the final CEE to more clearly outline the importance of the new station, and to better support the proponent’s conclusion that the scientific benefits arising from the station will outweigh the likely environmental impacts. For example, the document could more clearly identify how the proposed new research will differ from, or complement, a range of studies already undertaken at the existing research facilities in the Terra Nova Bay region. It could also emphasise the opportunities that arise to support research that can only be conducted at a year-round station (e.g. long term observation in the fields of geophysics, atmospheric science, meteorology). Furthermore, the final CEE could explain how the new station will be important for supporting planned research in the region (e.g. ice drilling, exploration for meteorites, paleo-climate studies on marine sediments) that might otherwise be conducted through field expeditions or with support from a ship. 
    • Section 1.3 could also be expanded to explain in greater detail the scientific research that will be supported by the ARAON, including during its passage between Jang Bogo station and King Sejong station. This could in part be addressed through a broader discussion of plans for long-term monitoring of the marine ecosystem.
    • The final CEE should incorporate the results of the hydrographic survey undertaken in February 2011 (Section 1.4, page 10) because these data will be critical to ensuring the safety of shipping operations and to informing the specifications for the dock. If gaps in knowledge remain following the field survey, these should be noted in Section 7 Gaps in Knowledge and Uncertainties and preferably be addressed with further investigations before construction commences. 
    • The last paragraph of Section 1.4 (page 10) could also note that, once completed, the final CEE will be circulated to all Parties at least 60 days before starting proposed activity. 
    • In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of Annex I, the ATCM will consider the draft CEE, but there is no mechanism for the ATCM to ‘agree’ with the proposed activity. The first sentence of the third paragraph in Section 1.6 (page 12) could be modified accordingly. 
    • It would be useful to identify whether the group of consulting experts referred to in Section 1.6 (page 12) will involve international participants. 
    2. Description of the Proposed Activity
    • To better demonstrate the importance of the new station for science, Section 2.2.2 (page 14) could explain the rationale for the station composition during winter (11 staff, 4 researchers) and whether the researchers are expected to manage one or more projects. Some other stations have roughly equal numbers of technical staff and researchers during winter. 
    • Section 2.2.2. (page 15) notes that other ancillary station infrastructure will be installed and refers to Appendix 1, but the appendix provides no further details about such infrastructure. 
    • The amount of food to be delivered to Jang Bogo annually (6000 kg) is low compared to experience elsewhere. 
    • Although Section 2.2.3 (page 17) notes that barges will be used to transport personnel and cargo ashore, the final CEE could clarify whether the barges will be unloaded at the proposed dock, or whether a separate landing site will be used. If the latter, the document should discuss any construction or earthworks that will be required. 
    • Further details could be provided regarding the materials to be used in the state of the art insulation (Section 2.3, page 17). 
    • The caption for Figure 2.3 (Section 2.3, page 17) could clarify that the image represents a conceptual model of the proposed station, and that the station will be situated in an ice-free area. 
    • Noting that the main sectors of the main station building will be located on the elevated first floor (Section 2.3, page 20), it would be useful to describe how cargo will be transferred from the ground surface into the main building. 
    • Consideration could be given to whether locating the heliport and maintenance upwind (i.e. to the west) of other facilities will have an impact on scientific observations (Section 2.3, page 18).
    • In addition to describing the ability to close particular portions of the main station building during winter, Section 2.3 (page 22) could also explain whether it is possible to shut down (‘winterise’) and then restart the whole station if required.
    • Stating in Table 2.2 (Section 2.3, page 22) the total expected electrical load during summer and winter would assist with clarifying the identified energy savings for the winter period. 
    • More detail could be provided regarding the ‘access passages for residential and research activities (Section 2.3, page 22), including whether these will be enclosed, on the surface, or below the surface. 
    • The description of the station design (Section 2.3, page 17) or another suitable section could specify the construction materials and confirm that no materials banned under the Environmental Protocol will be used. 
    • The description of the fire prevention plan (Section 2.3, page 24) could be expanded. It could explain how the fire blocking zones will be divided and what materials will be used (e.g. fire resistant barriers), whether fire alarms will be installed, and what provisions will be made to put out a fire (e.g. fire extinguishers, sprinklers, hoses). If water is to be used, this section could also describe the provisions for ensuring adequate water storage for normal operating conditions and emergency use. Figure 2.9 suggests that a mechanism similar to that used in aircraft will be used to facilitate exit from the building in the case of a fire, but this is not described in the text. 
    • The Range of Impacts discussion (Section 2.6, page 39) should also address the dock, fuel transfer activities, and any small boat activities. 
    • Consideration should be given to experience with the use of elevated buildings elsewhere in Antarctica when considering the likelihood of snow or ice accumulation under the main building, particularly due to the presence of the Air Handling Unit (Section 2.3, page 27). 
    • The description of the proposed dock (Section 2.3, page 29) could include a more detailed discussion of the proposed construction techniques, including where the material for the rubble mound and backfill will be sourced from, and how the ‘Gravity Wall’ construction (being unanchored) will withstand the affects of sea ice / icebergs. 
    • It would be good to clarify the approximate extent and volume of material that may be moved by the ‘surface grading’ for the construction of the main station, other permanent structures, temporary facilities (e.g. the 29 containers to be used during construction) and access routes, as mentioned in Section 2.4.1 (page 31) and also in Section 5.8 (page 91). 
    • The discussion of support requirements for the construction workers (Section 2.4.2, page 32) could be expanded to identify what kind of wastewater treatment plant will be used during the construction period, and how the treated effluent will be stored or discharged. Section 5.5.1 (page 81) states that a state of the art treatment system will be used, but does not provide further details). 
    • Section 2.4.3 (page 33) could describe whether cranes will be used to offload cargo from the barges and, if so, how many will be used. 
    • In Section 2.4.3 (page 33) it would also be useful to indicate whether the 36 items of heavy equipment are fitted with wheels or tracks (as this will have a bearing on the level of physical disturbance), and how many of these items will remain on station after the construction phase. 
    • Testing the assembly of the prefabricated building modules before delivery to Antarctica is strongly recommended (Section 2.4.4, page 33). 
    • The discussion of Wind Energy (Section 2.5.1, page 35) notes that 20 kW vertically stacked modular turbines will be used, but does not explain how many towers will be installed. This section could be updated to reflect the statement in Section 5.8 (page 91) that the plan is to install three 20 m high towers. 
    • The discussion of Energy Management (Section 2.5.1, page 34) could explain whether waste heat will be recovered from the incineration process as well as from the diesel generators. It could also explain why gas, not electric power, will be used for cooking. 
    • The final CEE could clarify what technology will be employed in the desalination facility (Section 2.5.2, page 36) (e.g. reverse osmosis or evaporation), and why this is the preferred approach to producing fresh water (e.g. economic and/or energy benefits). 
    • It is unclear whether the snow melting device will be used only in emergency situations (i.e. when the desalination facility is inoperable) or if the snow melting device and desalination plant will operate together (Section 2.5.2, page 36). 
    • The anticipated volume of fresh water required during operation (150 l/day/person) (Section 2.5.2, page 36) is large relative to the experience of another station at which water use is approximately (100 l/day/person, which is itself considered a large volume). 
    • It is unclear how the pipelines associated with the intake point for the water supply for the desalination plant (Section 2.5.2, page 36) and the wastewater outfall (Section 2.5.5, page 38) will be constructed and anchored to prevent damage by sea ice and icebergs. 
    • It is possible that the weight and volume of fuel required for incinerating food and sewage wastes (more than 50 000 kg) Section 2.5.3, page 37) will be greater than that of the wastes themselves. The use of this volume of fuel for incineration might also neutralise the benefits of the planned renewable energy generation. 
    • The final CEE could describe how the discharge point for waste water effluent was chosen (Section 2.5.5, page 38) and whether this decision was based on a baseline survey of the marine environment. 
    3. Alternatives to the Proposed Activity
    • The alternative of utilising existing stations in the Terra Nova Bay region (Section 3.1, page 41) could be discussed in further detail, including consideration of options for further developing these facilities for year-round operation. The advantages of such an approach would include: minimising the collective human footprint in the region; reducing the need for transportation and construction of new facilities; increasing international cooperation in Antarctic science; and enhanced overall cost and energy efficiency. 
    • The statement in Section 3.2 (Page 44) that the region surrounding Cape Möbius is absent of ‘major flora and fauna colonies’ could explain what is meant by ‘major’. 
    • Section 3.2 (page 41) could be restructured to more clearly identify the criteria used to select the station site (i.e. the ‘various decision factors’ – accessibility, weather conditions, safety, logistics, impacts on the ecosystem). 
    • The discussion of Alternative Transport in Section 3.6 (page 48) could be revised to clarify whether it is planned to use aircraft to transport personnel and/or cargo to the station. The first paragraph in this section states that aircraft and ships will be used, whereas the final paragraph states that marine transportation was selected over air transportation. If air transportation is to be employed, the impacts of the runway facilities and associated access routes should considered. 
    • According to Section 3.6 (page 49) route B is the most appropriate option for land transport of supplies to the station, including because use of the other two alternative routes would have the potential to cause wildlife disturbance. The final CEE could explicitly state that these other land transport routes will not be utilised. 
    • Given that materials transported from the ship will be handled many times before arriving at the station (i.e. ship to barge, barge to dock, dock to vehicles, vehicles to station) (Section 3.6, page 48) further information could be provided on measures to minimise the risk of spills/leaks. 
    • Section 3.6 (page 49) could identify the period (timing and duration) each year during which ice conditions will allow shipping access to the station, and whether the transport of personnel by ship will represent a time- and cost-effective approach. 
    • The discussion of Alternatives to the Proposed Activity (Section 3, page 41) could also address accommodating construction personnel on the ship as an alternative to establishing temporary accommodation ashore. 
    4. Initial Environmental Reference State of the Terra Nova Bay Region
    • Consideration could be given to locating the description of the Initial Environmental Reference State (current Section 4) after the Introduction (Section 1). 
    • In the final CEE the discussion of the Initial Environmental Reference State Section (Section 4) should incorporate the findings arising from the detailed field investigation undertaken after the draft CEE was circulated, in February 2011. 
    • Section 4.1 (page 53) describes wildlife colonies at Edmonson Point, Adélie Cove and Inexpressible Island. The location of these sites in relation to the proposed station site should be shown on a map and described in this section (Section 4.8 notes that ASPA 165 Edmonson Point is 40.9 km from the proposed site). 
    • If vegetation is present at the temporary pools in the vicinity of the station, this could be outlined in Section 4.1 (page 53). 
    • In discussing the wind regime at the proposed site (Section 4.5, page 61 and Appendix 2), it would be useful to clarify whether the maximum / minimum wind speed is an average or instantaneous speed. It appears that the proposed site may be subject to seasonality in wind speed which does not occur, and that the risk of high speed katabatic winds may also be higher. 
    • The description of the initial environment reference state of flora and fauna (Section 4.6, page 63) could be expanded to address terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates. The impacts of the proposed activities on these types of organisms should also be assessed. 
    • The discussion of Human Impacts (Section 4.7, page 67) should identify any infrastructure installed by Korea at the proposed station site prior to the preparation of the draft CEE (i.e. ATCM XXXIII/IP54 stated that a hut and automatic weather station had already been established). The proponent could also clarify how the installation of these items did not pre-empt the outcome of its consideration of alternative locations through the CEE. 
    • As well as listing the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Historic Sites and Monuments in the vicinity of the proposed station (Section 4.8, page 68), consideration could be given to identifying the environmental reference state of these sites. 
    5. Prediction of Impacts, Assessment and Mitigation Measures of the Proposed Activities
    • The ethylenepropylene rubber to be used for oil spill prevention (Figure 5.3.2, page 78) will need to be strong and reliable as it may otherwise degrade or develop holes over time.
    • Although Section 5.4.1 (page 79) identifies the likely volume of construction waste, it is not clear what total quantity of waste is expected to be produced during the construction phase (i.e. including wastes generated by the presence of large numbers of construction workers). 
    • The predicted noise levels illustrated in Figure 5.7 (Section 5.6.1, page 83) do not appear to account for the prevailing westerly winds, which may result in greater potential for noise impacts to the seal colony located to the east of the station. An explanation of how the calculated maximum noise level (50 dB) was determined would be useful. 
    • The statement in Section 5.7 (page 86) that the seal colony is more than 1 km to the east of the station seems inconsistent with the separation distance indicated in Figure 5.7. 
    • The likely impacts on the temporary pool closest to the station, and relevant mitigation measures, should be discussed in Section 5.7.1 (page 86). 
    • The mitigation measures identified in Section 5.7.1 (page 87) and Section 5.7.2 (page 90) could include steps to prevent, as far as possible, disturbance of the habitat for terrestrial vegetation. 
    • The measures that will be employed to ensure that research activities and visitors do not have a direct impact on major bird and seal colonies should be described (Section 5.7.2, page 89). 
    • Section 5.7.2 (page 89) states that it is unlikely that birds will strike the wind turbine towers. Evidence to support this statement would be useful. 
    • If the wind turbine towers will be supported by guy wires, the potential for birds striking the wires should also be addressed in Section 5.7.2 (page 89). Appropriate mitigation measures could also be identified (e.g. installing impact diverters on guy wires if used, shutting down turbines if bird strike becomes an issue). 
    • Figure 5.8 (Section 5.7, page 85) identifies a 200 m core zone for feeding activity of South Polar Skuas, as well as a 200-300 m buffer zone for feeding activity. The absence of a suitable terrestrial food supply (e.g. penguin colony) is likely to mean that the skuas will feed mainly in areas further offshore and by scavenging from the seal colony. The figure and related management provisions may need to be modified accordingly. 
    • The assessment of impacts on Scenery and Aesthetic Natural Values (Section 5.9, page 92) should be expanded to also consider impacts on wilderness values. Such an assessment could take into account the current absence of significant human disturbance, the spatial extent of the area in which proposed new structures (including access routes to more remote locations) will be visible, and the duration and severity of impacts on wilderness values. This section could also describe in further detail how the buildings and facilities at the station will be arranged to minimise impacts on the local scenery. Impacts on intrinsic and wilderness values should also be addressed in the Impacts Matrix (Section 5.12, page 93).
    • The discussion of cumulative impacts (Section 5.10, page 92) should also address the impacts of planned and possible future operational and scientific activities to be supported by the new station (e.g. expansion of logistics and transportation, establishment of a new drilling program in Northern Victoria Land). 
    • To better understand the possible cumulative impacts arising from discharge of wastewater (Section 5.10, page 92), a study of the dispersal environment could be undertaken and the results incorporated into assessment of cumulative impacts. 
    • The possible effects of ground disturbance from foot and vehicle traffic and other activities at the site over time could be considered in the discussion of cumulative impacts (Section 5.10, page 92). 
    • The following comments relate to the impact matrices presented in Table 5.5 and Table 5.6 (Section 5.12), pages 96-100:
    • Construction  > Ships > Shipping and cargo handling > Fuel spills and generation of hazardous wastes: the ‘Importance’ might more appropriately be assessed as Medium or High, to reflect the potentially significant impacts of a fuel spill on wildlife and coastal ecosystems. 
    • Construction activities > Construction of station > Fuel spills: the ‘Importance’ might more appropriately be assessed as Medium, to reflect the significance of potential impacts on soil/rock communities. 
    • Construction activities > Construction of station > Impacts caused by construction equipment and works: the probability of the predicted impact should be High. For clarity, it would be best to separate the assessment for physical disturbance impacts (e.g. soil compaction) from the assessment for biological impacts (e.g. arising from introduction of species). The probability of species being introduced, and the importance, may be greater than ‘low’. 
    • Operation of station > Generation of wastes and wastewater: the potential introduction of non-native species, and potential impacts arising from the discharge of brine from the desalination plant, should be addressed here. 
    • Operation of station: additional stressors could be added related to the ongoing operation of the dock, ship to shore transfer of fuel, management of snow drift, aircraft operations and small boat operations., with the predicted impact ‘contamination and disturbance of benthic habitat’. 
    6. Environmental Monitoring and Verification
    • The environmental monitoring plan (Section 6, Page 101) could identify the parameters that will be measured for each item listed. It would usefully address further biotic parameters (e.g. a census of the seal colony before and after construction), measurement of noise levels during construction and operation phases, and monitoring of the marine environment to identify impacts arising from wastewater discharge.
