Report of the Intersessional Open-ended Contact Group to Consider the Draft CEE for the “Proposed Exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth, Antarctica”
Working Paper submitted by Norway 


Summary
An intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) was established in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs to consider UK’s draft comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE) for “Proposed Exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth, Antarctica”. The ICG determined the draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental Protection. Participants raised a number of (mostly technical) issues for the CEP’s and proponent’s attention.
    1. Background
On 15 February 2011, in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol, UK notified Parties, through ATS Circular 8/2011, of the availability of the draft CEE for “Proposed Exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth, Antarctica”. The notice explained the CEE had been prepared by the Lake Ellsworth Consortium. It also advised of the location on the BAS website from which the draft CEE could be downloaded (http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ellsworthcee), invited CEP Members to make comments and recommendations, and nominated UK’s contact point. 
In accordance with the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs (Appendix 4 to the CEP X Final Report) the CEP Chair issued:
    • CEP Circular 7/CEP XI (15 February 2011), which advised of the availability of the draft CEE and:
    • advised of the need to establish an ICG to review the draft CEE;
    • proposed that Norway’s CEP representative, Ms Birgit Njaastad of the Norwegian Polar Institute, convene the ICG;
    • proposed terms of reference for the ICG; and
    • invited CEP Members to comment on the proposed convenor and/or terms of reference.
    • CEP Circular 8/CEP XIV (3 March 2011), which noted that no comments had been received on the proposed convenor or terms of reference.
Terms of Reference
As no Member proposed consideration of additional matters, the ICG addressed the three standard terms of reference outlined in the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs:
    1) The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.
    2) Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document.
    3) The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
Method of Operation
All ICG correspondence was available to CEP Members and Observers via the CEP Discussion Forum. The English language version of the full draft CEE was posted to the Discussion Forum, together with English, French, Spanish and Russian versions of the Non-technical Summary and Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (2005).
ICG participants were reminded by the CEP Chair and ICG convenor of the CEP’s agreement that the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs do not detract from the right of any Party to the Protocol to raise an issue on a draft CEE at meetings of the CEP or ATCM.
The ICG commenced with an initial comment period from 7 March to 8 April 2011. The convenor circulated a draft report for comment on 15 April and prepared a final report, addressing comments received, by the deadline for submission of Working Papers to ATCM XXXIV / CEP XIV (6 May 2011).
3. Summary of comments received from ICG participants
Comments were submitted to the ICG by seven CEP Members (Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia and the United States) and one observer (ASOC). Those comments are summarised below, under the relevant terms of reference (each submission is available in full from the Discussion Forum).
Note: Page references in this report relate to the English language version of the full draft CEE document available for download from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) website (http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ellsworthcee).

    1. The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol.
The ICG determined that the draft CEE generally conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol. 
The following elements were noted as potential weaknesses in this regard: 
    • Some doubts have been raised as to the limited level or even lack of description/assessment of the activities of the support contractor, ALE. From the Draft CEE is not clear if these specific activities have been/are covered by the multi-year IEE approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (as mentioned page 38) or if authorization will be provided by the UK as part of the permitting process for the proposed activity. The United States notes, however, that ALE’s support activities for the Lake Ellsworth project have not been assessed by them and that the activities of ALE that are part of the multi-year IEE under the purview of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are solely NGO activities and not those performed under contract to governments. It is necessary to ensure that all the aspects related to the drilling activity at Lake Ellsworth are assessed in terms of impact analysis of the activity, and whatever approach is chosen it must be made clear which activities are covered by the Draft CEE and which are covered by other processes. Incorporating all the aspects related to the drilling activity at Lake Ellsworth, including the whole logistics, in this Draft CEE would be the best and clearest approach in terms of impact analysis of the activity.
    • The above, as well as other observations relating to limited/lacking assessment of particular aspects (eg. related to assessment of Twin Otter operations, potential impact of hot water on biology of the lake) seem to indicate that the possible indirect effects of the activity have been given only a somewhat limited consideration in the Draft CEE. 

    2. Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document.
ICG participants generally agreed with the Draft CEE conclusion that the exploration of Lake Ellsworth will have a less than minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, taking into account the rigorous preventative and mitigation measures prepared and adopted by the proponent. The proponents are commended for their substantial effort applied to developing a suite of measures to minimise the risk of microbial contamination of Lake Ellsworth and possible connected subglacial water bodies and also their well considered approach to managing environmental aspects of the logistics and field support, including waste and fuel management, and measures to prevent the introduction and between locations transfer of species.
Participants also generally agreed that the global scientific importance and value to be gained by the exploration of Lake Ellsworth outweighs the impact on the environment and justifies the activity proceeding. 
Several participants commented on the fact that CEEs normally are developed for activities that are expected to have more than minor or transitory impacts, while the conclusion on this particular Draft CEE is “ less than minor or transitory “. UK’s reasoning behind the decision to provide a Draft CEE was noted, and it was noted by participants that there are a number of uncertainties and risks associated with the project which obviously gave reason to assume that the activity could have “more than a minor or transitory impact” entailing the compilation of a CEE1. Some participants noted that initiating a CEE process does not necessary pre-conclude on the level of impact. It was noted by some that the extensive and structured evaluation provided in the impact matrix presented in Table 6 provided sufficient support for the conclusion. Several participants noted that it might be useful to reflect further on this matter in the concluding section.
The proponent was also commended on the “honesty” of the conclusion, noting the statements to the effect that the impacts could be more severe should anything unexpected happen during the drilling operation. 
Participants also noted with appreciation the stated intention to include further information in the final CEE (e.g. anticipated atmospheric emissions associated with transport, detailed plans for the deployment of the thermistor string, final selection of population control methods), as well as the indication that the Lake Ellsworth Consortium would welcome an independent environmental audit or inspection of the activity.
ICG participants did, however, identify a number of matters for which they considered further information or clarification should be provided in the final CEE as further support as basis for the conclusions of the document. These are discussed and presented in Section 4 and Appendix A. 

    3. The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
ICG participants generally agreed that the draft CEE is clear and well-structured , well written and with high quality graphs and figures. All in all participants found the document easily read. In particular the structure and approach to the assessment of impacts provided in the impact matrix in Table 6 was commended. ICG participants generally congratulated UK for preparing a detailed comprehensive document. 
ICG participants did, however, identify a number of matters for which they considered clarification should be provided in the final CEE in order to ensure better clarity for the reader. These are presented in Appendix A and in Appendix B. 

    4. Specific comments
ICG participants identified a number of matters for which they considered further information or clarification should be provided in the final CEE, either as further support as basis for the conclusions of the document or in order to ensure better clarity for the reader. The following section describes some overarching issues raised by one or more ICG participants. A summary of other points for which one or more participants suggested clarification was required or desirable is given in Appendix A. A range of minor editorial points were identified for the proponent to consider when preparing the final CEE. These have been attached in tabular format in Appendix B. 

    • It is noted that the biggest potential for disturbance of the lake is the initial break through at the ice water interface. The description provided in the Draft CEE assumes that the mixing of drill water with lake water is expected to be limited. Further documentation/consideration as to the issue of potential mixing at break-through would, however be relevant and strengthen the basis for the conclusion of the assessment. It is in this context also noted that it is essential to have onsite monitoring and to have a response plan should there be surprises in real-world conditions not conforming to the laboratory certifications. It is noted that the Draft CEE mentions on-site microscopy, but that there is no discussion of how the onsite measurements will (or will not) be used in decision making on site. It is underlined that thresholds and responses should be defined a priori.
    • In the context of the above it is also noted that little (if any) consideration has been given to assessing the potential impact of very hot (nearly boiling) water on any organisms in the lake body, particularly as the real water temperature of the surface layer of the lake is unknown. In this regard, determination of the required adaptation time of the submerging device to the real aquatic environment conditions is not clear as it too will be heated when passing through hot water in the borehole. This also raises questions concerning the validity of scientific measurements taken in the water column. Further discussions as to this aspect of operations, potential impacts and measures that could be taken avoid/minimise such impacts could be appropriate. 
    • Furthermore, it was noted by some that it could be desirable to provide further discussion as to how to minimize the disturbance of the water column as a result of the presence of the scientific equipment, how to minimize the chance of cross-contamination or mixing across existing environments within the lake which are brought into contact because of the scientific equipment, e.g.,between the ice and the water environments, between the water and the sediments, or between the different strata within the water column.
    • Questions are also raised with respect to the level of assessment of risk of equipment loss in the lake. Questions posed include: Will the corer easily re-enter into the bore hole at the contact of water and ice. Can drift in water (if any) carry away the equipment which will have difficulty, if not in a vertical position, to re-enter into the hole? Could the probing connections fail, or be connected improperly, leading to the loss of the probe? Are there any devices which contain components that could potentially decompose and contaminant the water body if not recovered? It is noted that if such an accident happens, it is assumed that the risk for the lake environment would be very low, but it could be useful if these issues were considered more in depth in the Draft CEE, including a discussion as to contingency to recover any components of the hot water drill, probe, corer or ancillary equipment that detaches from its deployment hose or cable.
    • Chapter 1 provides an overview of phases in the project. It is noted that the description of Phase I indicates that activities related to the Lake Ellsworth project have been ongoing since 2009.  It may be beneficial to add a “Pre-drilling Characterization” section that would identify and briefly describe activities which supplied data for this CEE but were covered by environmental documents other than this CEE.  These pre-drilling studies with the CEE activities could then clarify the analysis basis for direct/indirect and cumulative impacts, referring also here to the comment above regarding compliance with protocol requirements.
    • Several ICG participants noted the limited size of the on-ice team and queried the project safety in this regard. Questions were raised as to whether such a small on-ice team will be sufficient (both with respect to number of people and expertise) to perform effective mitigation in the case of unplanned events, such as a blowout or big spill. 
    • One ICG participant posed the question whether there are any plans to provide protection of Lake Ellesworth as an ASPA, referring in this context to SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Exploration and Research of Subglacial Aquatic Environments2. 
    • Lastly, it was noted that the Lake Ellsworth Consortium is composed of several UK Universities and Institutes but apparently without collaborations from other countries, whereas both the SCAR Code of conduct for the exploration and research of subglacial aquatic environments (guiding principle #3.3) and the NAS guidelines on environmental stewardship when exploring subglacial lakes (Recommendation 5) encourage multinational participation in SAE exploration. Consequently it would be useful with some considerations relating to international collaboration in the document. 
Conclusions
Having reviewed UK’s draft CEE for the “Proposed Exploration of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth, Antarctica” in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs, the ICG advises the CEP that:
    1) The draft CEE and the process followed by UK generally conform to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
    2) There was general agreement with the proponent’s conclusion that it will entail less than minor or transitory impact t taking into account the rigorous preventative and mitigation measures prepared and adopted by the proponent. There was furthermore general agreement that the proposed activity is justified on the basis of the global scientific importance and value to be gained by the exploration of Lake Ellsworth. 
    3) The draft CEE is clear and well-structured.

When preparing the required final CEE, the proponent should closely consider and address, as appropriate, the comments raised by participants and summarised above and in Appendix A. The final CEE could furthermore be improved by taking into consideration participants’ editorial suggestions (identified in Appendix B)
Appendix A. Other points for which one or more ICG participant suggested clarification was required or desirable

Non-technical Summary
    • General: It has been pointed to that the justification stating that the project will provide information to assess the present-day risk of ice sheet collapse and consequent sea-level rise is questionable. The point being that assuming that the project is successful in retrieving a sediment core and analysis are successful it remains questionable whether those findings can be applied to the present-day conditions where the forcing of the climate system and the state of the system is very different preventing an over interpretation of the results. Some consideration to this question could be given, also in the context of the discussion in Chapter 2.
    • General: Consideration should be given to provide somewhat more detail about the alternatives that have been considered (cf. Chapter 7), particularly with respect to drilling technology and choice of lake. This would provide easier access to information on the choices made.

Chapter 1: Introduction
    • It is stipulated a four day window for drilling and sampling. This seems too short and consideration should be given to doubling the window for these activities to allow for the types of complications that invariably occur at deep field sites.

Chapter 2: Description of proposed activity

Background and justification (Page 7)
    • Page 7, second column, sixth paragraph: It is stated that the project expects to recover a 1-3 m sediment core from the floor of Lake Ellsworth. Questions were raised as to the availability of such precise information about the sediment thickness obtained from the surface, especially because the free water reflection usually influences the results. Documentation confirming that the method used can provide such accuracy would be interesting and useful.
    • General: In Chapter 7 (p 42) there is a discussion relating to alternative sites/lakes. Consideration could be given to including a short paragraph summarizing this, and describing why shallower, less important lakes were not selected in Chapter 2, in order to strengthen the justification presented in Chapter 2. 


Chapter 3: Baseline conditions of Lake Ellsworth

Ice cores and lake geochemistry (Page 14)

    • The Draft CEE seems to give only limited attention to the ice geochemistry and its biological content in spite of collection of the snow samples from a season. It is noted that the ion chemistry which is presented seems strange and the presence of HCO3- in Antarctica ice is very questionable and likely wrong. Referring the Byrd ice core as done in the report, the ice is acidic and the electric conductivity measurement is possible even in the “dusty” ice from the last glacial maximum. This is not the case for Greenland ice where carbonates are present in excess in the glacial ice. For the biological content, concentration of ~103/ml is likely for coastal region or for dirty snow, but such a value is likely not representative of clean snow of for inland Antarctic ice. We can expect that contamination occurred during the sampling or cell measurement of the snow surface as reported page 16. Caution should be exercised for biological investigations and because the unexpected low content of Antarctic snow, the combination of biological analysis to be conducted according to protocol along with the chemical analysis is recommended.  It is therefore recommend that the ion chemistry and the biological investigation of the samples to be conducted/advised according to the standards from experienced ice chemists (e.g. BAS researchers who participated to EPICA project as an example). 

Chapter 4: Description of technologies

Hot water drill (Page 16-21)
    • Page 16, sixth paragraph: It is indicated that pre-1800 yr old ice will be melted for the drilling fluid.  Further information as to how this process will be started and whether any surface snow will be used could be useful.  It could furthermore be useful with a clear confirmation in the text as to whether antifreeze liquid (glycol or other) will be used in addition to prevent water in the hose to freeze, especially at the beginning of the operation and at the end. This point is very important because if such an antifreeze liquid is used, this raises issues 1) for the storage of the antifreeze when the hole will be used for water 2) for the cleanness of the hose and the contribution of the antifreeze to the dissolved organic carbon in the hole. These will not be issues if only hot water is used.
    • Page 16, second column, last paragraph: It is noted that the recycled water is from glacier melt and will be filtered and UV treated and supposed to be very clean at this stage. As the very low ionic content makes the water very aggressive with respect to any metal or organic based tubing the question remains open with respect to the behaviour of the hose when heated at 90C under high pressure and under high debit. Here we would have liked to have seen reference in the document to the experience gained by the “Ice Cube” project which was deployed during the last 10 years, at the South Pole station. The Ice cube project (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) used a similar hot water drill (may be more powerful) developed for lowering down instrument (neutrino telescope) to 2 km depth into ice. Report on the operations, how they impact the snow and the borehole cleanness, could be relevant in respect to this draft CEE. 
    • Page 16, second column, last paragraph: It is understood that the hose that will be used is made from carbon fibers and likely with organic material. The produced dust may therefore disturb carbon and organic content of the water filling the hole and in the next instance in some way the water from the lake. One would expect a lot of dissolved organic carbon from the tubing will be present in the hole. Natural concentrations of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Antarctic ice do not exceed a few ppb (10-9g/g) (Prunkert et al, Environ. Sci. Technol. 2011, 45, 673–678).  Consideration could be given to a sampling of the water from the hole a few meters above the lake serving as a field truth for its potential impact on the lake geochemistry when lowering the probe in the hole for sampling the lake water.
    • Page 17, second column, first paragraph: It is indicated that the drill fluid will be sampled to assess the quality of microbial control and to provide a comparator for lake samples. An indication as to sampling frequency would be useful. 
    • Page 17, second column, third paragraph: The proponents indicated that that filters will be changed at set differential pressures and furthermore that filters will be saved for later evaluations. An indication as to the frequency of filter replacement and filter preservation would be useful. 
    • Page 17: Ensuring that the hole is finished and wide enough will require the hot water drill to blast away at the top of the otherwise pristine water column.  It might be better to switch to a passive thermal probe for this final stage.
    • General: A description of what will be done to minimize mixing of stratified layers (dilute, mixed, and concentrated) in the lake would be helpful. Similarly, discussions as to what will be done to prevent sediment in or on the outside of the corer from being released in the water column upon retrievable of the sampling device.
    • Page 17, second column, last paragraph: It is stated that testing of the equipment will be conducted “as far as practicable”. It would be useful to include a list of what testing will be done on the hot water drill system prior to shipping.  Providing a list of what is expected to be tested and expected not be tested will be more useful than the general statement given. 
    • Page 17: It would be useful if the Draft CEE could include more details describing how the cavity below the hydrological water level (270 m) will be formed and what its dimensions will be. Cf. Figure 11.

Thermistor string (Page 22)
    • It would be useful if the CEE included information as to what material the thermistor string will be made of, and specifically if it will be resistant to corrosion or made of any hazardous materials.
    • It could be worth considering the potential that by the time the project is in operation there may no longer be a need for a communication cable in the ice for the thermistor measurements. Ongoing technological development points to wireless communication with measuring devices within the ice. It might be useful to add a statement along the line in the proposal.
    • The deployment of a thermistor string is viewed as being an important contribution to future science; so hopefully, this can be achieved, perhaps using a temperature senor on a fiber optic cable, if the power requirements permit.

Chapter 5: Description of the camp and the logistics
    • General: If the communications link between the drill site and the domestic camp that allows remote monitoring and operation of the equipment  is mentioned as part of the site safety plan, it would be helpful to know more about the remote operation procedures.

Camp overview and location (Page 26)
    • Somewhat more detailed information on the expected extent of the planned camp and its components (containers, tents etc.) would be useful.

Power generation and fuel calculations (Page 27)
    • The fuel calculations in chapter 5 (p. 27) are comprehensible and obviously correct.However, due to safety aspects the contingency of 15 % is tightly allocated and possibly not sufficient for such a project. Further consideration as to this issue might be given. 
    • The drilling project is an energy intensive project. It would be useful to see a discussion whether there are any plans to make use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency applications.

Water and waste (Page 28)
    • The types of wastes generated are listed, but it would be useful if it were possible to provide estimates of the amount of wastes generated and further information on “appropriate” waste storage containers in addition. 

Transport of equipment and personnel (Page 28)
    • Very little information is given about BAS Twin Otter. Taking into account the number of drums for refueling (p. 27) and the flight range of a Twin Otter, it implies that refueling is necessary during its flight to Rothera. No information on refueling sites are given, and no information on the consequences of this (fuel depot etc.). The CEE could be improved substantially by expanding discussions in this regard. 

Chapter 6: Identification or prediction of impacts, including preventative or mitigating measures. 

Impact on native flora and fauna (Page 30-31)
    • Page 31, first column, fifth paragraph: No details are provided describing the borehole liner and gate valves to provide an air-lock. It could be useful if the proponents included an explanation as to what these devices are intended to do, how they will be deployed, recovered, and decontaminated.

Microbial control at design stage (Page 31)
    • Page 31, second column, first paragraph: The document would be strengthened if  more details on the HPV method were provided, particularly non-medical field applications.

Microbial control during construction, transport, and deployment on site (Page 31-32)
    • Page 32, first column, first full paragraph: It is stated that the hose will be jet washed during drilling. It would be useful with clarification as to whether this is a separate step, or a normal part of the drilling, and if it is a separate step some discussion as to what efforts will made to capture the wash water.

Population reduction methods (Page 32-33)
    • Page 32, second column, last paragraph: It would be useful to include a discussion as to what criteria will be used to decide if an object needs Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor treatment in the field.
    • Page 33, general: The CEE would benefit from a discussion on methods that will be used for verification and assessment to ensure that equipment which were pre-cleaned, treated, and sealed prior to transport to the drill site are not contaminated during handling and shipping. Reference to data that indicate that sterile water samples, which will be loaded into to water sampler before shipping, will stay sterile for a year would also be useful.

Non recovery of equipment (Page 37)
    • It is indicated the borehole may be re-reamed to melt potential sticking points. A reflection in the text as to whether the same the same approach can (and will) be used if the probe, corer, or other device becomes stuck in the borehole would be useful.

Impact on wilderness and aesthetics (Page 37)
    • It is stated that the thermistor, if deployed, will be left in situ permanently. Could the CEE describe whether this means that temperature measurements will be planned only one time or whether it will make several measurements during several years, implying new visits to the site? Note that this issue could also be discussed under the description of the thermistor string on page 22. 
    • The stated intention to clean all equipment and wash clothing before departure to Antarctic is supported. It is, however, noted that it could be useful to consider further measures such as vacuuming of pockets, bags etc and relevant treatments for footwear.
    • It is suggested to consider/adding that the traverse route also has transitory impacts on wilderness and aesthetic values. Presumably, like other existing traverse routes, the route will be marked by wands on the ground and tracks (and possible minor spills) will be visible at least for a season or two.

Impact matrix/Table 6 (Page 38-41)
    • Page 40: Under the heading Operating the science camp reference could also be made to the possibility of fuel spills, and the intended mitigation/prevention measures (including the use of proven fuel bladders, drip trays etc).

Annexes

Annex 1 Engineering Blowout Prevention Strategies. (Page 55-57) 
    • Heading 4 on Physical blow-out preventer: It has been pointed to that as long as the hole is not cased by a tubing, hole pressure does not apply to the valve. In case of blow out, the water column and gases from the hole will be flushed back through the porous snow. The blow out preventer might therefor likely have no utility.

Comment
General
It is recommend that a very simple map showing the location of the main sites cited in the text: Lake Ellsworth, Union Glacier, Patriot Hills, Rothera is added to the CEE.
Page 16, column 2, 
Correct the drill speed: 1.0 m.mn-1 and 0.5 m.mns-1 instead 1.0 m s-1 and 0.5 ms-1 (is it correct?)
Page 17, column 2, 
The term "tapping of points" is confusing - perhaps "sampling ports" would be a better term 
Page 22, column 1 
The size of the sediment coring system is not very clear. A scale would be useful on Figure 14 (p. 23).
Page 27, column 1
The power generation and fuel calculations are a bit confusing.  Some numbers seem rounded (e.g., 8 week season = 56 days at 24 hours/day = 1344, not 1300) others seem arbitrary (Generator 1 = 650 hours).  Presenting the information in a table with appropriate footnotes would be helpful.
Page 28, column 1
The statement is made that "The only vehicle used on site will be a Tucker Sno-Cat...", but then there are discussions about the ALE tractor train in a subsequent section. It might be helpful to point out that transient tractor train vehicles will come and go from the site 
Page 31, column 1
Here the term HPV is first introduced but is not defined until page 32 (under "Population Reduction Methods"). This acronym is used frequently on pages 31-33, so it would be helpful to say "hydrogen peroxide vapour" earlier in the section.
Page 35, column 1
Define the term "CO2e" the first time it is used.  The term is also used frequently in Table 5 (p. 36). Consider adding a footnote to page to explain the meaning.
