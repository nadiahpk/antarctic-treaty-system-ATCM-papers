Proposed schedule for the 35th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Hobart, 2012
Working Paper submitted by Australia 
Summary
Australia is pleased to host the 35th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXXV) in Hobart in 2012. Consistent with the consensus agreement reached at ATCM XXXIII (2010), the meeting will be held over an eight day period, from Monday 4 June to Wednesday 13 June. ATCM XXXIII also agreed that ATCM XXXIV would consider the modalities for holding the meeting within this reduced timeframe. Australia invites comments on a suggested work schedule for the eight day meeting, with a view to adopting an agreed approach at ATCM XXXIV.
    1. Background
At ATCM XXXIII (2010) the Parties discussed the development of a multi-year strategic work plan and options for improving the efficiency of ATCMs (ATCM XXXIII Final Report, paras 529 to 537). The Parties reflected on these discussions when considering preparations for ATCM XXXV to be held in Hobart in 2012, and agreed that:
‘…ATCM XXXV should be held over a period of eight working days. It was also therefore agreed that ATCM XXXIV would consider the modalities for holding ATCM XXXV within an eight day timeframe, including a general review and update of the agenda…’ (para 537).
Australia is pleased to host ATCM XXXV and, in accordance with the consensus agreement reached at ATCM XXXIII, has secured a suitable venue in Hobart for the eight day period from Monday 4 June to Wednesday 13 June 2012. 
    2. Proposed schedule for ATCM 35
As the host of ATCM XXXV, Australia wishes to ensure that the Meeting can be conducted efficiently and effectively within an eight day period. The draft schedule at Attachment A represents Australia’s proposal for scheduling the major components of the Meeting. 
The following matters were considered when developing the proposal:
    • The schedule proposes an allocation of time to plenary sessions, the Working Groups established in recent years (i.e. Tourism, Science and Operations, Legal and Institutional) and the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP). Any new or different Working Groups could be inserted in place of meeting time scheduled for the current Working Groups. 
    • Scheduling five days in the first week and three days in the second week reduces the overall duration of the Meeting to eight days, while still allowing the CEP meeting to proceed as normal. This reflects that ATCM XXXIII did not agree to reduce the length of the CEP meeting. In Australia’s view, maintaining a five day CEP meeting appropriately reflects the Parties’ long-term focus on developing measures to protect the Antarctic environment, and acknowledges that steps have already been taken to improve the Committee’s efficiency and effectiveness in addressing its continuing high workload.
    • No meetings are scheduled during the middle weekend, to ensure that delegates and support personnel (e.g. interpreters) have a rest period, and to allow time for translation of the CEP report.
    • The reduction in meeting time will reinforce the importance of tightly managing the presentation and discussion of papers.
    3. Recommendations
Australia recommends that the ATCM and CEP consider the suggested work schedule for ATCM XXXV, with a view to adopting an agreed approach during ATCM XXXIV.
