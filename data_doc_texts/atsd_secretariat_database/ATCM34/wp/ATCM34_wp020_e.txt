Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2010/11





Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting Activity in Antarctica in 2010/11
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom in conjunction with IAATO
Summary
This WP provides an update on data contained in WP52 presented by the US and UK at ATCM XXXIII and supplements WP XX submitted by Germany, Australia, Norway, United Kingdom and USA to ATCM XXXIV.  The aim of the WP is to highlight the numbers of yachts in and around the Port Lockroy area of the Peninsula in 2010/11.  Parties are invited to note and add to this information and to consider whether yachts have been authorised to enter the Antarctic area.  
Introduction
There is ongoing interest in, and concerns about, the conduct of some yachts in Antarctica.  As noted in ATCM XXXIII/WP52 a number of attempts are being made to compile relevant data in order to make an accurate assessment of the potential environmental risks and to improve safety and compliance associated with Antarctic yachting.  IAATO’s IP14 highlights their outreach programme to the yachting community to improve awareness of the Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol requirements for visiting Antarctica.  Other Parties have also undertaken initiatives to educate and inform potential yacht visitors to Antarctica, for example, the United Kingdom has recently developed detailed guidelines about its domestic legislation requirements for those seeking permits to take yachts to Antarctica, and supported a yacht training course (further details of the course are in IP15). Consideration is also being given by many other Treaty Parties to improving safety of yacht operations and compliance with Antarctic Treaty instruments, and this will be further discussed at ATCM XXXIV.
As highlighted in ATCM XXXIII/WP52, the United Kingdom conducts an extensive visitor monitoring scheme (for all visitors and vessels) at Port Lockroy.  The attached data has been derived from both this monitoring scheme, and other incidental reporting of yachts sighted in the Peninsula by IAATO.  Whilst not necessarily exhaustive, the attached data could be used to give a rough indication of the extent of yacht tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula during the last season.   Treaty Parties will recall, and as noted in WP52, that IAATO yachts comprise only a small component of the Antarctic yachting community and this is again reflected in the numbers of yachts observed in 2010/11. 
Recommendation
The ATCM is invited to:
    a) note the information relating to observed yachting activity in the Antarctic Peninsula this season (with reference to the previous information about yachting activities in ATCM XXXIII/WP52);
    b) invite Parties to continue to share information, including, for example, the post visit site reports, in line with Resolution 5(2005), particularly for any non-IAATO yachts they have authorised (cf. ATCM XXXIII Final Report para 228), in order to add to existing data about the extent of yachting activities in Antarctica, and levels of site visitation by yachts; and
    c) consider the extent to which yachts observed in Antarctica during the past season were authorised to enter the Antarctic Treaty area.
