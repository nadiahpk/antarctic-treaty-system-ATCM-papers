Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on Terms of Reference #4 and #5: Improving Management Plans and the Process for their Intersessional Review
Working Paper submitted by Australia on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
During the 2010/11 intersessional period the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SMGP) undertook several tasks relating to its role of developing advice to the CEP on improving management plans and the process for their intersessional review. In accordance with the work plan agreed by CEP XIII the SGMP: revised the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas; finalised suggested standard wording and a template for ASPA management plans for inclusion in the revised Guide; collected further information to help identify options for the review of management plans not referred by the CEP for intersessional review; and developed an outline for the CEP Workshop on Marine and Terrestrial Antarctic Specially Managed Areas. The CEP is invited to consider the outputs of this intersessional work.
    1. Background
This Working Paper reports on the work undertaken by the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) during the 2010/11 intersessional period, in accordance with Term of Reference #4 ‘Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review’ and Term of Reference #5 ‘Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent and likely to be effective’.
CEP XIII (2010) adopted the SGMP Work Plan for 2010/111, which identified the following tasks under Terms of Reference #4 and #5:
    • Finalise suggested standard wording and template for management plans.
    • Review and commence revision of Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, including to incorporate:
    • suggested standard wording and template for management plans (see ATCM XXXIII/WP30);
    • guidelines for the application of management zones (see ATCM XXXIII/WP10);
    • cross-references to the guidelines appended to Resolution 1 (2000) (see ATCM XXXIII/WP51);
    • guidance regarding climate change considerations for management plans (see ATCM XXXIII/WP63, Recommendation 19); 
    • guidance on preventing the introduction of non-native species (see ATCM XXXIII/WP9, Annex III, Item 3); and
    • other appropriate modifications.
    • Further planning for a workshop to share best practice in ASMA management and develop Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Managed Areas.
    • Invite those Parties responsible for Type 2, 3 and 4 plans (as identified in ATCM XXXIII/WP30) to provide information about the review status and timeframe, as basis for further prioritization.
A report on each of these tasks is provided below.
The SGMP’s activities under Terms of Reference #1 to #3 are detailed in a separate Working Paper Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on Terms of Reference #1 to #3: Review of Draft Management Plans.
    2. Finalise suggested standard wording and template for ASPA management plans 
CEP XII (2009) considered the SGMP’s review of the standard components of ASPA management plans and, acknowledging the benefits of promoting consistency between management plans, agreed that several components were suited to the development of suggested standard wording. CEP XII also agreed that a template would similarly assist with ensuring consistency between management plans.
The SGMP commenced development of suggested standard wording and a template for ASPA management plans during the 2009/10 intersessional period template. CEP XIII (2010) considered the preliminary results of the work and agreed that the SGMP should finalise such products for inclusion in a revised version of the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide). 
During the 2010/11 intersessional period the SGMP held one further round of discussion on this task. Only minor amendments were introduced, and the final product is presented as Appendix 3 of the revised Guide at Attachment A to this Working Paper. In introducing the template, the Guide reiterates the SGMP’s previously stated view that the availability of suggested standard wording should not discourage management plan proponents from developing and implementing site-specific or creative and innovative approaches to area protection and management.
Advice to the CEP
The CEP is invited to endorse Appendix 3 to the revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, comprising a Template for ASPA management plans with suggested standard wording for suitable components. 
    3. Revision of the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas
CEP XIII endorsed the SGMP’s proposal to review and commence revision of the Guide during 2010/11. As noted above, the SGMP Work Plan identified several specific issues to be considered in this work. 
The general sense within the SGMP was that a full re-write was not required, but that there were a range of opportunities to update and improve the Guide. Following three rounds of discussion, the SGMP introduced a range of suggested amendments, intended to ensure that the revised Guide reflects contemporary best practice in the preparation of ASPA management plans and continues to provide useful assistance to proponents. The most substantial changes include:
    • the original introductory text was replaced by a new Introduction, prepared by the SGMP member from Norway, which discusses the concept of a protected areas network, provides background on identifying candidate ASPAs, and presents a list of relevant guidance materials developed since the original Guide   was adopted in 1998 (including reference to the Guidelines for Implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol appended to Resolution 1 (2000) and the Environmental Domains Analysis identified in Resolution 3 (2008));
    • the guidance for preparing the Introduction to a management plan was updated to reflect the CEP’s agreement that management plans should include a clear statement about the primary reason for designation, and should describe how the Area complements the protected areas system as a whole;
    • guidelines for the standard application of zones in ASPAs, prepared by the United States, were incorporated into Section 6(v) Special zones within the Area;
    • guidance regarding climate change considerations for management plans, prepared by the SGMP member from the United Kingdom, was introduced into several relevant sections (1. Description of values to be protected; 6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features);
    • guidance on preventing the introduction of non-native species, also prepared by the SGMP member from the United Kingdom, was introduced into several relevant sections (2. Aims and objectives; 7(vi) Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area; 7(ix) Disposal of waste; 7(x) Measures that may be necessary to continue to meet the aims of the Management Plan);
    • the description of the approvals process for management plans, and accompanying flowchart, were updated to reflect current practice (e.g. including the role of the SGMP) and to refer to relevant CEP guidelines;
    • the ASPA Visit Report Form was modified, including to improve consistency with the reporting requirements under the electronic information exchange system (EIES) (Appendix 2);
    • a template for ASPA management plans was added, with suggested standard wording for suitable components (Appendix 3, as discussed above);
    • the section headings and numbering were updated to reflect the section headings and numbering in the template for ASPA management plans which, as discussed above, was added at Appendix 3; and
    • the opportunity was also used to update the format of the Guide for consistency with the ATS Style Guide, and to remove content that can be easily accessed via the ATS website (e.g. Appendix 1 – text of Annex V; Appendix 2 – Management Plan for Moe Island; Appendix 5 – protected area references; Appendix 6 – National Contact Points).
Advice to the CEP
The CEP is invited to consider the revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas presented at Attachment A to this Working Paper and, if agreed, to forward the revised Guide to the ATCM for adoption by means of a Resolution. A draft Resolution is presented at Attachment B.
    4. Planning for the ASMA workshop
In its report to CEP XIII the SGMP presented an initial outline for a possible Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) workshop. The Committee endorsed the idea and noted that it remained necessary to identify a suitable date and venue, as well as options for funding the attendance of experts. The Committee warmly welcomed a generous offer by Uruguay to host a workshop prior to CEP XIV, and noted that further discussions with Argentina, as hosts of CEP XIV, would take place during the intersessional period before any arrangements for a workshop were finalised. The Committee noted that the objectives and themes identified by the SGMP in Section 6 of ATCM XXXIII/WP30 would provide a good basis for a workshop.
During the 2010/11 intersessional period the SGMP further developed the workshop outline, representing a proposal (agreed following discussions between Uruguay and Argentina) to hold the workshop in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 16-17 June 2011. The draft workshop outline was circulated for comment via CEP Circular 6 / CEP XIV. Further workshop planning was managed by the workshop co-conveners, Juan Abdala (Uruguay) and Ewan McIvor (Australia). The outcomes of the workshop are presented separately.
    5. Approaches to reviewing plans not referred for intersessional review
CEP XIII established a long-term goal of ‘ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent, and likely to be effective’. It also agreed that the SGMP should invite those Parties responsible for Type 2, 3 and 4 plans2 to provide information about the review status and timeframe, as a basis for further prioritisation with respect to any necessary action needed to achieve the long-term goal. 
The SGMP member from Norway continued to lead the SGMP’s work on this task. In October 2010, a request for such information was circulated to the proponent Parties for each of the 17 (14 + 3) management plans belonging to Type 2/3 and Type 4. Responses received provided information for 12 of these management plans, and can be summarised as follows:
    • Responses about the review status for 11 of 13 ASPAs in Type 2/3 were received (ASPAs 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 114, 115, 117, 122, 126, 147 and 148 representing three proponent Parties). Review processes have been planned and/or initiated for all these ASPAs, with an indication that fieldwork for the review will have been initiated and/or revised management plans will have been submitted for all areas by 2012;
    • No information about the status of the review process was received for the remaining two ASPAs in Type 2/3 (ASPAs 128 and 151 representing one proponent Party). 
    • A response about the review status for the single ASMA in Type 2/3 was received (ASMA 2). A planned review process has been established, with an indication that the revised management plan for this area will be submitted at CEP XIV in 2011.
    • No information about the status of the review process was received for the 3 ASPAs in Type 4 (ASPAs 112, 144 and 146 representing one proponent Party).
On the basis of this information the SGMP concluded that:
    • For a significant portion of the ASPAs in Type 2/3, as well as the one ASMA in this category, there are processes well underway that will ensure revised management plans for review by the CEP (and potentially the SGMP) in a timely manner within the next few years. The SGMP need not take any further actions as to the need for considering how to move these plans into the review process.
    • For a minority of ASPAs in Type 2/3, as well as all the ASPAs in Type 4, there is no indication as to whether a review process has been contemplated or initiated, and no indication as to what the obstacles for delay may be. No information is available with regard to what pressures the areas in question may be under, and thus there is no information as to the urgency of a review to ensure best possible management of the areas. The SGMP would require such information before it could advise the CEP on the possible need for action to achieve the long-term goal of ‘ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent, and likely to be effective’. In particular it would be useful to have information on the Type 4 plans which are yet not provided in an Annex V format.
Advice to the CEP
The CEP is invited to consider whether further efforts should be initiated towards the proponent Parties that have not yet provided information on the review status of management plans.
    6. SGMP work plan
CEP XIII endorsed a provisional SGMP work plan for the 2011/12 intersessional period. The SGMP has prepared a slightly modified version of the work plan (Attachment C). 
Advice to the CEP
The CEP is invited to consider the suggested SGMP work plan the 2011/12 intersessional period, presented at Attachment C, and to instruct the SGMP accordingly.
