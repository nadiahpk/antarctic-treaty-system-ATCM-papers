SSSI No. 18 
Working Paper Submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection by the United 
States of America 
At CEP IV (St. Petersburg, 2001), an Intersessional Contact Group was established to 
review five revised draft management plans submitted to the CEP by the United States, as 
follows: 
• 
Specially Protected Area No. 7 – Cape Hallett, Northern Victoria Land, 
Ross Sea 
• 
Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 1 – Cape Royds, Ross Island 
• 
Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 3 – Barwick and Balham Valleys, 
South Victoria Land 
• 
Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 4 – Cape Crozier, Ross Island 
• 
Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 18 – Northwest White Island, 
McMurdo Sound 
The United States led the Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) in the review of the revised 
management plans.  Comments on the management plan were received from New 
Zealand, the United Kingdom, and SCAR.  These comments have been incorporated into 
the management plans and related maps. 
Significant changes adopted: 
• 
Improvements were made to maps, including the addition of inset maps, 
notations about overflight restrictions, and clearer latitudinal and 
longitudinal markings. 
• 
Penguin population counts were updated for Cape Crozier and Cape 
Royds plans. 
• 
Updated information was included on vegetation species for Cape Crozier. 
• 
Any mention of vehicles routes no longer in use were removed (for SPA 
No. 7, Cape Hallett, SSSI No. 1, Northwest White Island, and SSSI No. 4, 
Cape Crozier). 
• 
Shortened Section 1, Description of Values Section, for SPA No. 7, Cape 
Hallett. 
• 
Where appropriate, reasons for designation and for boundary changes 
were further clarified. 
 
Other points raised: 
• 
Suggestions were made that poultry restrictions should be made stricter.  
The United States notes that advice provided by SCAR indicates there is 
no scientific evidence that Antarctic avifauna are at risk for disease from 
poultry products.  The language included in the management plan reflects 
the wording generally accepted by the CEP on the use of poultry products 
in protected areas and is felt to be sufficient in terms of preventing risk of 
introductions. 
• 
It was noted that a list of references were lacking from the management 
plans.  While the United States supports the current trend to include 
references in the management plans, it is noted that the revised plans were 
drafted before the inclusion of references became common practice. 
 
The finalized management plans are attached to this Working Paper and are submitted for 
approval by the CEP and the ATCM.
