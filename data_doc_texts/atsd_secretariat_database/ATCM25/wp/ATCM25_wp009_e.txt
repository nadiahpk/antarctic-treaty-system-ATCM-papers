 
Implications of the entry into force of Annex V to the Environmental Protocol 
 
Working Paper 
Submitted by the United Kingdom 
 
 
Introduction. 
 
1. Annex V to the Environmental Protocol entered into force on 24 May 2002 following 
approval of Recommendation XVI-10 by all Consultative Parties entitled to attend ATCM 
XVI. 
2. The purpose of Annex V is to rationalise the Antarctic Protected Areas System.  Its entry 
into force has a number of implications that the CEP will need to consider.  These relate 
both to the international management of the protected areas system, through the CEP / 
ATCM, as well as to the actions that Parties individually may need to take in respect of 
their domestic legislation. 
3. This paper attempts to clarify these implications, and makes suggestions as to what 
actions may need to be taken. 
 
General observations. 
4. Firstly, entry into force of Annex V to the Protocol supersedes Article VIII of the 1964 
Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, under the terms of 
which all Specially Protected Areas (SPAs) had previously been held.  Entry into force of 
Annex V also supersedes Recommendation VII-3 (1972), which introduced the category 
of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). 
5. Indeed, the implication must be that the Protocol and its (now) five Annexes have 
superseded the whole of the 1964 Agreed Measures.  As such Recommendation III - VIII, 
under which the Agreed Measures are held, may well be a candidate for repealing under 
the ATCM’s review of past decisions. 
6.  Secondly, Annex V identifies in its Article 2, that marine areas may also be designated as 
either Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) or Antarctic Specially Managed Areas 
(ASMAs).  Articles 3(1) and 4(1) of Annex V further reinforce the concept of marine 
protected areas, and Article 6(2) notes that no marine area shall be designated without the 
prior approval of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR). 
7. The UK would note that the issue of marine protected areas around Antarctica has yet 
fully to be addressed.  No substantive marine areas have yet been designated.  As such the 
CEP, in co-operation with the Scientific Committee of CCAMLR, may wish to give 
consideration to developing some guiding principles to assist with the selection and 
designation of a network of Antarctic marine protected areas. 
Specific Observations. 
8. The more specific implications of the entry into force of Annex V are set out in the table 
below. 
 
 
 
Annex V 
Article: 
Provisions: 
Implications: 
3(3) 
• 
SPAs and SSSIs automatically designated as 
ASPAs; 
• 
ASPAs must be renumbered accordingly 
• 
Renumbering was agreed by means of Resolution V 
(1996), but this needs to be updated (see below); 
• 
Parties may need to give effect to renaming and 
renumbering in domestic legis lation. 
5(1) 
• 
Any Party, the CEP, SCAR or CCAMLR may 
propose an area for designation as an ASPA or 
ASMA by submitting a proposed management 
plan to the ATCM 
• 
To note those eligible to submit ASPA and ASMA 
proposals. 
6(1) 
• 
Procedures for the submission and approval of 
management plans 
• 
CEP has already established guidelines for its 
consideration of draft management plans (paras 84 & 
85 and Annex 4 of the Final Report of CEP III refer); 
• 
CEP has taken the view that SCAR’s participation in 
intersessional review of draft management plans would 
satisfy the requirements of Article 6(1) (para 64 of the 
Final Report of CEP IV refers); 
• 
Article 6(1) introduces a fast-track mechanism for the 
approval of management plans, i.e. 90 days after the 
closure of the meeting at which they were adopted; 
• 
Many management plans still need to be revised and 
updated in Annex V format (Resolution 1 (1998) 
refers). 
6(2) 
• 
No marine area shall be designated without prior 
approval of CCAMLR 
• 
Consideration needs to be given over the means by 
which management plans with a marine component are 
referred to CCAMLR: should the proponent decide on 
referral or the CEP?; 
• 
Decision 4 (1998) sets out the criteria as to when such 
plans should be forwarded to CCAMLR. 
6(3) 
• 
A review of management plans shall be initiated 
every five years 
• 
CEP may wish to update the national responsibilities 
for revising management plans appended to Resolution 
1 (1998) and to prepare an agreed timetable for review 
of these plans. 
6(6) 
• 
Upon approval management plans shall be 
circulated by the Depositary which shall also 
maintain a record of approved plans 
• 
CEP may wish to consider developing a central web-
based archive for storing protected area information. 
7(1) 
• 
Permitting provisions for entry into protected 
areas 
• 
Parties are required to establish an appropriate 
authority to issue permits to enter ASPAs; this may 
require action to be taken in domestic law. 
 
 
Annex V 
Article: 
Provisions: 
Implications: 
7(2) 
• 
Permits may be issued to enter sites that do not 
have management plans, for compelling 
scientific purposes 
• 
Only two ASPAs appear not to have management 
plans: ASPA 104, Sabrina Island, and ASPA 113, 
Litchfield Island.  Consideration should be given to 
addressing these sites with some priority. 
8 
• 
Historic Sites and Monuments can be designated 
as ASPAs, ASMAs or simply listed; 
• 
Procedures for adding new sites to the list of 
Historic Sites and Monuments; 
• 
Depositary shall maintain the list of Historic 
Sites and Monuments (HSMs) 
• 
Previous list of HSMs held under Recommendation 
VII-9 is transferred (Rec. VII-9 now obsolete); 
• 
Fast-track mechanism for the approval of new HSMs 
introduced, i.e. 90 days after the closure of the meeting 
at which they were adopted; 
• 
CEP may wish to consider developing a central web-
based archive for storing HSM information (NB; HSM 
review currently underway) 
9 
• 
Principles established for making publicly 
available, information on ASPAs, ASMAs and 
HSMs; 
• 
Provides also for the marking of site boundaries 
where appropriate 
• 
Parties shall make available information on the location 
etc of protected areas to those intending to visit 
Antarctica; to this end the CEP may wish to consider 
developing a central web-based archive for storing and 
making available protected area information; 
• 
Parties shall mark protected areas on maps and charts; 
• 
Parties should consider (where appropriate) marking 
sites with boundary markers.  This may extend to, for 
example, establishing permanent signs.  
10 
• 
Procedures for exchanging information set out 
• 
Parties shall, before 30 November each year, inform 
each other and the CEP of: the number of ASPA 
permits issued, measures taken to implement Annex V 
and any protected area inspections / visits undertaken; 
• 
Parties shall include in the annual Treaty exchange of 
information summary descriptions of activities 
undertaken in ASPAs and ASMAs.  
 
9. Of the implications set out in the above table, the UK would highlight the following in 
particular: 
Article 3(3). 
Article 3(3) of Annex V stipulates that all Specially Protected Areas (SPAs) and Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) designated as such by past Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meetings are hereby designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs).  As such, 
concurrent with the entry into force of Annex V on 24 May 2002, all SPAs and SSSIs 
automatically became ASPAs.  This Article also requires ASPAs to be renumbered 
accordingly. 
By means of Resolution V (1996) the ATCM had agreed a system for renumbering the SPAs 
and SSSIs as ASPAs.  However, this list should be updated to take account of those sites 
adopted since 1996.  It is therefore proposed that the updated list that is appended to the draft 
Resolution attached to this paper, be adopted. 
 
Article 3(3) and Article 7. 
We note that Parties may need to consider changes to domestic law to account for the 
renaming and renumbering of ASPAs as well as in respect of establishing an appropriate 
authority to issue permits for entry into ASPAs. 
Article 6(3). 
By means of Resolution 1 (1998) Parties were allocated responsibility for revising certain 
management plans to meet the requirements of Annex V.  Under the terms of Article 6(3) of 
Annex V a review of each management plan shall be initiated every five years.  The CEP may 
therefore wish to update the table appended to Resolution 1 (1998) and to establish a rolling 
timetable for the review of management plans. 
It is noted however, that several sites still require management plans to be prepared in Annex 
V format. 
Articles 9 and 10. 
The CEP may wish to consider developing a central web-based repository of information on 
all protected areas and historic sites and monuments.  Such a system would also assist with 
the requirement to make information about protected areas publicly available. 
Articles 6(1) and 8(2). 
We note that Annex V introduces a fast-track approval process for measures dealing with 
ASPA and ASMA management plans as well as for new HSMs.  By this mechanism, and 
unless the measures specifies otherwise, it shall be deemed to have been approved 90 days 
after the closure of the ATCM at which the measure was adopted, unless one or more Parties 
notifies the Depositary (within 90 days) that it either wishes an extension to this deadline or 
that it is unable to approve the measure. 
Summary. 
10. The CEP is invited to consider the issues raised in this paper, and in particular the 
attached draft Resolution, and recommend that action be taken where necessary. 
 
 
DRAFT Resolution … (2002) 
Naming and numbering system for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas 
 
The Representatives, 
Noting the entry into force of Annex V on 24 May 2002; 
Noting also the provision of Article 3(3) of Annex V that all SPAs and SSSIs designated as 
such by past Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings are hereby designated as Antarctic 
Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) on the entry into force of Annex V, and shall be renamed 
and renumbered accordingly; 
Recognising the naming and numbering system for ASPAs adopted by means of Resolution V 
(1996) and the need to update this system to include new protected areas adopted by 
subsequent ATCMs;  
Recommend that: 
1. The naming and numbering system for ASPAs annexed to this Resolution be adopted; 
2. All ASPAs adopted by the present and subsequent ATCMs be added to the list in 
consecutive order of adoption and be numbered accordingly.
