An Assessment of Environmental Incidents

Arising from Activities in Antarctica

BACKGROUND 
 
1. During discussions on the “Liability Annex” at XXIV ATCM in St Petersburg, the meeting requested 
COMNAP to update its previous Working Paper (XII ATCM/WP5) on environmental incidents, which 
was presented to the Special ATCM XII convened in The Hague during September 2000.  The Hague 
paper was, in turn, and update of a paper first prepared by COMNAP in response to Resolution 6 of the 
Tromso XXII ATCM and subsequently presented to the XXIII ATCM held in Lima during May/June 
1999.  Thus this current paper is the third of a series as follows: 
 
• 
XXIII ATCM/WP16 
 
Lima, Peru 
 
 
 
May/June 1999 
• 
XII SATCM/WP5 
 
The Hague, Netherlands 
 
September 2000 
• 
XXV ATCM/WP?? 
 
Warsaw, Poland (this paper) 
 
September 2002. 
 
2. Preparation of the first two papers required data on individual incidents to be collected from each 
national program and the information manually collated and statistical data extracted.  In the case of the 
current paper, an “Environmental Incident Reporting System” (EIRS) was developed and installed on the 
COMNAP web site that enables each national program to enter details of incidents soon after they occur 
(if necessary).  The EIRS then automatically produces a summary of incidents and computes statistical 
reports on the number and percentage of incidents in various categories (e.g. chemical spills, oil spills, 
transport accidents, etc).  The web-based system is therefore far less labour-intensive than the earlier 
manual process and the information can be more readily updated. 
 
3. The EIRS provides three downloadable reports: 
 
• 
Table 1: 
Environmental Incident Summary 
• 
Table 2: 
Cumulative Statistics on Environmental Incidents. 
• 
Table 3: 
Annual Statistics on Environmental Incidents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. The data presented in the second paper (XII SATCM/WP5) was used as the base - or starting point - 
for beginning the new web-based format, data series.    Paper XII SATCM/WP5 includes data on 
environmental incidents for the period January 1989 to 30th September 1998.  Thus Table 1 lists (with a 
few exceptions) incidents that have happened each year (ending 30th September) from 1999 onwards.  In 
Tables 1 and 2 the statistics given under 1998 represent the cumulative totals from January 1989 to 
September 1998.  Thereafter, the statistics given under each year (from 1999 onwards) give the 
cumulative increases in incidents (in the case of Table 2) or annual increases in incidents (in the case of 
Table 3). 
 
 
 
SURVEY RESULTS 
 
5. Table 1 summarises an additional 37 incidents that have been reported during the current survey 
period from September 1998 to 2002.  Tables 2 and 3 indicate that the proportion of incidents occurring 
in each of the categories (e.g. chemical spills, oil spills, transport accidents, etc) are statistically 
comparable with similar data provided in the earlier two reports (i.e. XXIII ATCM/WP16 and XII 
SATCM/WP5).  It is therefore considered that the conclusions and recommendations provided in the two 
earlier reports are still valid. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
6. From the results of the survey it is concluded that: 
 
• 
there are minimal adverse environmental impacts resulting from ground or air transport incidents 
or fires (These events appear to occur infrequently and when they do the magnitude of their 
impact on the environment is insignificant); 
• 
the most common incidents with the greatest potential to cause environment impacts are fuel 
spills; 
• 
most fuel spills in Antarctica are likely to be small and confined to a station or base or the 
adjoining waters and are unlikely to threaten wildlife; 
• 
fuel spills in the marine environment have a low probability of occurrence but pose a greater 
magnitude of risk to wildlife than terrestrial or ice sheet spills  (Clearly, marine spills in the 
vicinity of rookeries, breeding grounds or primary habitats for marine mammals or birds pose a 
higher risk than marine spills in open sea or less sensitive areas); and 
• 
because fuel spills have greatest potential to cause environmental impacts, spill prevention 
strategies are the most effective tool to minimize potential environmental impacts, followed by 
emergency preparedness and spill response. 
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
7. It is recommended that: 
 
• 
National Antarctic operators continue to implement the COMNAP guidelines on fuel transfer, 
fuel spill prevention and containment, and emergency response action and contingency planning 
as required by ATCM XXII Resolution 6 (1998) as they are clearly effective in reducing the risk 
of environmental impacts; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
National operators should continue to ensure that all fuel handling and storage equipment are 
maintained in good order and that spill response exercises are held on a regular basis as these 
measures will significantly reduce the frequency and magnitude of liquid spills, and thereby 
minimise environmental impacts; and 
• 
COMNAP continues to collect and collate data annually from all the national programs on 
incidents with potential adverse effects on the environment arising from national program 
activities so that COMNAP can periodically reassess the guidelines and revise as necessary, as 
recommended in Resolution 6 (1998).  COMNAP suggests that the ATCM seek comparable 
information from non-governmental organisations operating in Antarctica so that a more 
comprehensive database may be assembled.
