Budget Projections for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat































 Submitted by Argentina and Australia
BUDGET PROJECTIONS FOR THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT   

Preparing a realistic budget for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is difficult at this time as there are a large number of factors relating to the operation of the Secretariat that have yet to be finalised.   These include:  
    • the functions to be performed by the secretariat, including whether the secretariat will provide interpretation services at meetings, undertake translation of documents prior to and during meetings, be responsible for translating and archiving meeting documents from ATCM I – ATCM XXIV (final reports, working group reports, working and information papers etc);  
    • the number and classification of staff to be employed in the secretariat and whether they are employed on a casual or permanent basis; 
    • if staff will be paid UN salaries or local salaries;  and
    • the cost of procuring goods and services in Buenos Aires; 

Nevertheless, it is necessary to have some idea of the potential cost of the secretariat if progress is to be made with its establishment at ATCM XXV.  Consequently, the following budgets have been prepared to aid discussion of these issues at ATCM XXV.  Draft budgets are provided for both the interim and permanent periods of the Secretariat.

The budgets have been developed in accordance with the agreements reached at the informal meeting held in Buenos Aires in June, 2002.  Staffing levels are based on what are considered to be the minimum levels required to operate the Secretariat during the interim and permanent periods.  They do not include allowances.  All figures are provided in US dollars.  Figures for office and general services and support costs have been based on the CCAMLR Secretariat’s 2002 budget. These are indicative figures only as they are likely to be slightly inflated as the CCAMLR Secretariat provides a wider range of services than those expected to be undertaken by the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in the short term. 

Budget 1 (Interim Period) 

The following assumptions have been made in the preparation of this budget:
    • The Executive Secretary’s salary will be paid by a Consultative Party as a voluntary contribution.
    • All other staff are paid local United Nations Development Program salaries (These are set in accordance with the value of the Argentine peso).
    • A total of five staff members are employed comprising the Executive Secretary, Finance/Admin Manager, Data Manager/IT specialist, Documentation Officer and Secretary/Administrative Assistant.  This is considered to be the minimum number of staff required to operate the Secretariat.
    • The salary costs for translation and interpretation services and the hire of a meeting venue are met by the Host Government for ATCM.
    • Equipment costs for ATCM, including the hire of translation and interpretation equipment, is provided from the Secretariat’s budget.  Note that a revised total that excludes the costs of these services is also provided at the bottom of the budget.
