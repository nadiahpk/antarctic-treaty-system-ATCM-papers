Amended Rules of Procedure of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings – Establishment of the Secretariat

























Submitted by Australia
Amended Rules of Procedure of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings – Establishment of the Secretariat

The role of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat will be to provide support to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) in order that they may operate with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.  This includes practical support to the conduct of meetings in association with the Host Government.

The ATCM Rules of Procedure will need to make provision for the role of the Executive Secretary if he/she is to perform the role of Secretary in the conduct of meetings.  To assist consideration of this issue, attached is a suggested revision of the Rules of Procedure to reflect this role.  It also proposes other changes as a consequence of the establishment of the Secretariat.
 
The specific activities to be undertaken by the Secretariat during an ATCM will need to be elaborated in the broader discussion of the Secretariat's budget and functions and in terms of the decision/s made concerning which activities will remain the responsibility of the host government.  This paper is provided without prejudice to those discussions.
 
Suggested changes to, and deletions from, the existing Rules of Procedure are indicated in the attached document.
