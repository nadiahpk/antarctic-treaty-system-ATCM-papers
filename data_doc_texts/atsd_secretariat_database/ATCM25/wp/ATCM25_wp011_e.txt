Working paper 
submitted by Germany 
on the results of the intersessional contact group on the 
review of the structure and working practices of the ATCM

    1. At the 24th ATCM, Germany introduced WP I “Working practices and procedures of the Consultative Meetings and their Working Groups”. The aim of the paper was to review the structure and working practices of the ATCM with a view to enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The meeting agreed to establih a contact group coordinated by Germany during the intersessional period to enable the consultative parties to continue the discussion allowing for the submission of a revised working paper at the 25th ATCM.

    2. The terms of reference of the contact group were agreed as follows:
b) to review the structure and working practices of the ATCM with a view to enhancing efficiency and cost effectiveness; and
b) to report with proposals to the ATCM. 

    3. The contact group did not deal with changes in the working practices caused by the establishment of the secretariat. Nevertheless the contact group hopes that the implementation of the proposals mentioned below will be facilitated by the future secretariat. Many proposals concern tasks that could be assumed by a permanent secretariat and should therefore be considered in the process leading to the establishment of the secretariat.

    4. The contact group exchanged information via e-mail. In the course of the year, it became apparent that consensus would not be reached on some of the proposals made in the working paper. Therefore it seemed appropriate to subdivide the proposals and consider only those which remained uncontested.

    5. The following proposals seem to attract unanimous support:
    • Longer-term planning of the items on the agenda, including discussion of elements on the agenda of Consultative Meetings at the preceding Consultative Meeting; 
    • At the end of each Consultative Meeting, the host Government of the next Meeting shall prepare a detailed preliminary agenda; 
    • As far as possible, preparation of the subject matter of the agendas and early structuring of the work of the Working Groups and other bodies (e.g. the Working Group “Discussion of the Liability Annex”); 
    • Increased use of modern means of communication (especially the Internet and e-mail) for informal cooperation in the run-up to the Consultative Meetings (for example, the informal working group to evaluate the Environmental Impact Assessment of the EPICA project prior to the 12th Special Consultative Meeting in The Hague);
    • Making use of the options allowing several Consultative Parties to coordinate and submit joint working papers; 
    • Discontinuing the practice of written opening addresses.

    6. The most controversial issue is the length and cycle of the Consultative Meetings. Furthermore some participants suggested that, instead of having two working groups, there should be only one (plenary) body creating ad-hoc sub-groups as the need arises. The views on these issues diverged strongly so that a consensus could not be reached.

    7. The above proposals do not require an amendment to the rules of procedure.

    8. In order to put the aforementioned proposals into practice, Germany proposes the adoption of the following draft decision:














Decision 1

The Representatives,

Recalling the need to review the structure and working practices of the ATCM in order to enhance the effectiveness of the consultative meetings,

Noting that within the intersessional contact group consensus could be reached on a number of proposals which would alter the working practices of the ATCM,

Decide that

    • Longer-term planning of the items on the agenda, including discussion of elements on the agenda of Consultative Meetings at the preceding Consultative Meeting, shall be undertaken; 
    • At the end of each Consultative Meeting, the host Government of the next Meeting shall prepare a detailed preliminary agenda; 
    • As far as possible, preparation of the subject matter of the agendas and early structuring of the work of the Working Groups and other bodies (e.g. the Working Group “Discussion of the Liability Annex”) shall be undertaken; 
    • There should be an increased use of modern means of communication (especially the Internet and e-mail) for informal cooperation in the run-up to the Consultative Meetings (for example, the informal working group to evaluate the Environmental Impact Assessment of the EPICA project prior to the 12th Special Consultative Meeting in The Hague);
    • The options allowing several Consultative Parties to coordinate and submit joint working papers shall be used more often; 
    • The practice of written opening addresses shall be discontinued.
