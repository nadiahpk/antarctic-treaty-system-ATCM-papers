Draft Staff Regulations for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat



Draft Staff Regulations for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat


To assist Parties in their consideration of the issue of staff regulations for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat Australia presented an informal paper at the consultations in Buenos Aires in June 2002. The paper contained draft regulations based on those currently used for the CCAMLR Secretariat, with suggested modifications to make them suitable for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.

Following consideration of the paper at that meeting Australia accepted a request to receive Parties comments on the paper and to prepare a new version of the paper incorporating those comments. The revised paper is attached as an annex.

The additions made by Australia to the CCAMLR staff regulations in the informal paper presented at the meeting in Buenos Aires are shown as under-lined text in the annex. Deletions to the CCAMLR staff regulations are shown in the boxes to the right. Comments that have been received from Consultative Parties, either at the informal meeting or subsequent to the meeting, are shown as footnotes.

It should be noted that the attached document has been compiled to assist consideration of this issue at ATCM XXV. It does not represent agreed text or final views of the Parties making comment. In this regard New Zealand does not consider the CCAMLR regulations offer a suitable model, but the comments provided in the attached document are consistent with the approach it will be taking, while not being a comprehensive representation of its position.
