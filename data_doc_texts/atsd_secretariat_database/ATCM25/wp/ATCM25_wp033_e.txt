Protected Areas: 
Proposed Management Plan For Frazier Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, 
Antarctic Specially Protected Area 
 
Australia proposes that Frazier Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica be designated as an Antarctic 
Specially Protected Area under Article 3 of Annex V of the Madrid Protocol.  
 
In particular: 
- 
the area has an important and unusual assemblage of species, particularly major colonies 
of breeding native birds (article 3(2)(c); 
- 
designation of the area is appropriate to protect the values set out in article 3(1). 
 
The Frazier Islands contain the largest known breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels 
Macronectes giganteus in continental Antarctica. 
 
The Southern Giant Petrel is inferred to have sustained a population reduction of at least 20% over the 
last 60 years (three generations) probably owing to interactions with longline fisheries, although it is 
also sensitive to human disturbance such as tourist activities, ship movements and overflights. The 
establishment of an the Antarctic Specially Protected Area will assist in providing further protection 
for the Southern Giant Petrel by minimising human disturbance in a very important breeding location 
in Antarctica. 
 
The plan for the Antarctic Specially Protected Area has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of Annex V to the Madrid Protocol and the Guide to the Preparation of Management 
Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, appended to Resolution 2 (1998) of Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting XXII. 
 
It is recommended that Parties adopt the proposed Management Plan. A draft Measure to this effect is 
attached.

1. 
Description of Values to be Protected 
 
The Frazier Islands, a group of three islands located approximately 16km offshore 
from the Australian Casey Station in East Antarctica (Map A) at 66°13’S 110°11’E, is 
a breeding locality for Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus.  Southern Giant 
Petrels are currently listed as Vulnerable under International Union for the 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria.  
 
The population of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands is the largest known in 
the continental Antarctic1.  The most recent estimate of the population was 248 
breeding pairs in 2001/022.  Breeding colonies of Southern Giant Petrels are found on 
all three of the Frazier Islands (Nelly, Dewart and Charlton Islands).  The largest 
breeding population is found on Dewart Island (Map B), with smaller colonies on 
Nelly and Charlton Islands.   
 
The Frazier Islands are one of only four known breeding localities of Southern Giant 
Petrels around the coastline of continental Antarctica and are the only site in nearly 
3000km of coastline between Davis and Dumont d’Urville3.  The other three 
continental breeding colonies are located near the Australian stations of Mawson 
(67º36’S, 62º53’E) (Giganteus Island) and Davis (68º35’S, 77º58’E) (Hawker Island), 
and near the French station Dumont d’Urville (66º40’S, 140º01’E) in Terre Adélie4.  
The Southern Giant Petrels on the Antarctic continent comprise less than 1% of the 
global breeding population5.  The current population for continental Antarctica is 
estimated at approximately 290 pairs, comprised of 3 pairs on Giganteus Island, 25 
pairs on Hawker Island, 16 pairs at Pointe Géologie archipelago (Terre Adélie) and 
248 pairs on the Frazier Islands6. 
 
The breeding season for Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands usually 
commences between late October and mid November, and extends through to April 
with their departure northward for the winter (Murray and Luders 1990).  Chicks from 
the Frazier Islands disperse throughout the Southern Hemisphere, with banded chicks 
recovered in New Zealand, South America, Easter Island, and South Africa within 
nine months of departure (summarised in Murray and Luders 1990).   
 
The global breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels is listed as Vulnerable under 
IUCN criteria (Table 1) and is estimated at around 31,300 pairs7.  A total of 30 
populations contain 500 or fewer breeding pairs, and at 15 of these sites there are 50 
or fewer breeding pairs8.  In the previous three generations, the global population has 
decreased by 20-50%9.

Following its discovery in 1955, the breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels at 
the Frazier Islands decreased until the early 1980s (Appendix 1).  The estimated total 
breeding population at the Frazier Islands in the mid 1950s was approximately 250 
pairs (Appendix 1).  The population decreased by approximately 80% and was visited 
six times, or once every 4-5 years between discovery in 1955 and the recorded 
population minimum of 57 pairs in 198210.  The population has increased since 1982 
with more than 200 nests recorded in 1998/99, and almost 250 nests in 2001/0211.  
Most other breeding populations are decreasing12.   
 
Breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels are highly sensitive to human 
disturbance at their colonies.  It has been suggested that visits to the colonies to band 
adults and chicks contributed to the decreases recorded13.  Reductions in breeding 
populations of Southern Giant Petrels at other locations in the Antarctic and 
Subantarctic have been attributed to activities associated with stations14.  The bycatch 
of Southern Giant Petrels in longline fisheries operating in the Southern Ocean is also 
likely to have contributed to observed population decreases15.  Decreases in breeding 
populations of Southern Giant Petrels have also been observed at sites where human 
disturbance has been minimal, such as Heard Island16.   
 
Apart from visits for seabird censuses, the Frazier Islands have been visited relatively 
infrequently.  Twenty-three visits, or on average one visit every two years has 
occurred since 1956.  In the mid 1980s, a management strategy was implemented for 
all three breeding localities in the vicinity of Australian Stations to minimise human 
disturbance to breeding colonies of Southern Giant Petrels.  The strategy involved the 
Australian  Antarctic Division restricting census visits to one in every three to five 
year period and implementing tight administrative controls over all other visits.  The 
interval was considered an appropriate compromise between the risk of disturbance to 
breeding birds from censuses and the need to obtain meaningful population data.  The 
strategy is believed to have contributed to the stabilisation and recovery observed in 
two of the three populations in Eastern Antarctica during the late 1980s onwards.  
 
The recent increase in the breeding population of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier 
Islands in contrast to global trends, combined with the apparent positive effects of the 
existing management strategy, suggests that continued and formalised protection of 
Southern Giant Petrel breeding colonies may be warranted.  Long-term protection and 
monitoring of Southern Giant Petrels at the Frazier Islands will contribute to the 
development of appropriate regional and global conservation strategies for the species 
and will provide information for comparisons with populations elsewhere. 
 
2. 
Aims and Objectives 
 
Management of the Frazier Islands aims to: 
 
• 
minimise human disturbance to the breeding colonies of Southern Giant 
Petrels to assist stabilisation and recovery of the population in the wild; 
 
• 
conserve the Frazier Islands as a reference area for future comparative studies 
with other breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels; 
 
 
3 
• 
minimise the possibility of the introduction of alien plants, animals and 
microbes to the Frazier Islands;  and 
 
• 
preserve the Frazier Islands, henceforth, as a highly restricted Area by limiting 
human visitation to the islands during the Southern Giant Petrel breeding 
season. 
 
3. 
Management Activities 
 
The following management activities shall be undertaken to protect the values of the 
Area: 
 
• 
one research visit should be conducted to census the Southern Giant Petrels 
and other seabird populations in each 5 year period to enable monitoring of 
breeding populations.  These visits are to be conducted by two people, one of 
whom should be a bird biologist associated with an approved national 
program(s) or who has had previous field experience with Southern Giant 
Petrels; 
 
• 
information on the location of the Frazier Islands ASPA (stating the 
restrictions that apply) shall be produced and prominently displayed at Casey 
Station and copies of this Management Plan shall be available at the station.  
Informative material and the Management Plan shall be provided to ships 
visiting the vicinity; 
 
• 
clothing (particularly all footwear) and field equipment shall be appropriately 
cleaned before entering the Area;  and 
 
• 
the Management Plan shall be reviewed at least every five years and 
updated/modified as required.

Description of the Area 
 
6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features  
 
The Frazier Islands are located at latitude 66°14’S, longitude 110°10’E  
(Map A).  The three islands (Nelly, Dewart and Charlton Island) lie in the eastern part 
of Vincennes Bay approximately 16 km to the west north west of Casey Station.  
Nelly Island is the largest of the three islands (approximately 0.35 km² in area), and 
was named for the presence of several colonies of Southern Giant Petrels or “Nellies”.  
The proposed ASPA comprises the entire terrestrial area of the three islands, with the 
seaward boundary at the low water mark (Map B).  The total area of the Frazier 
Islands ASPA is approximately 0.6 km².  There are no boundary markers.   
 
6(ii) Restricted Zones within the Area 
There are no restricted zones within the Area. 
6(iii) Location of Structures within the Area 
There are no structures within or adjacent to the Area and none are to be erected. 
 
6(iv) Location of other Protected Areas within close proximity 
 
The following Protected Areas are located on the Budd Coast near the Frazier Islands: 
 
• 
North-east Bailey Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.135 
(66°17’S, 110°32’E); 
• 
Clark Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.136 (66º15’S, 
110º36’E);  and 
• 
Ardery Island and Odbert Island, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.103, 
(66º22’S, 110º30’E). 
 
6(v) Other natural features  
 
Nelly Island supports the largest and most varied avian community of the three 
islands, with records indicating that Snow Petrels (Pagodroma nivea), Cape Petrels 
(Daption capense), Antarctic Petrels (Thalassoica antarctica), Wilson’s Storm-Petrels 
(Oceanites oceanicus), Southern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialiodes), and South Polar 
Skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) all nest on Nelly Island.   South Polar Skua nests 
have also been found on Dewart Island (Table 3, Map B). 
 
In 1961/62, 100 Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) nests were reported in one 
colony on Nelly Island17.  During the 1989/90 season, three colonies were recorded on 
the northwest ridge of Nelly Island with a total of 554 nests.  The increase 
corresponds with those recorded for most other Adélie Penguin populations in the 
Windmill Islands region during the period from 1959/60 to 1989/9018.  In the 2001/02 
season, approximately 1,000 pairs were estimated to be nesting on Nelly Island19.

Recorded sightings of marine mammals at the Frazier Islands are scarce;  however, in 
1968 three Weddell Seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) were observed on an ice floe 
located between Nelly and Dewart Islands.  An Orca (Killer Whale:  Orcinus orca) 
was also sighted offshore from the islands during the same year20.  A few Leopard 
Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) were sighted near Nelly Island and a low number of 
Weddell Seals were recorded on the sea ice near the Frazier Islands in the 2001/02 
season 21. 
 
Vegetation recorded at Nelly Island comprises at least 11 species, including lichens 
Buellia frigida, Usnea antarctica, Rhizoplaca melanopthalma, Candelariella flava22, 
(a terrestrial alga Prasiola crispa, an indeterminate green crust which is thought to be 
‘a mixture of fungal hyphae and green alga Desmococcus olivaceus’23, and several 
species of snow algae including Chlorococcum sp., Chloromonas polyptera, 
Chlorosarcina antarctica, Prasiococcus calcarius24.  There are no published records 
of terrestrial invertebrates on the Frazier Islands;  however, no surveys have been 
carried out25.

Census data for breeding seabirds provided where available, ‘P’ indicates recorded breeding seabirds 
but no census data available, 2001 indicates observations in December 2001 visit, ‘X’ indicates 
recorded on or near the island, ‘N’ a count of nests, ‘R’ rare, and ‘F’ frequent.  Data complied from 
records held by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre, ANARE records 1968, Appendix 1, Melick et al. 
1994, Seppelt, R. pers. comm.,  Ling, H. pers. comm., Woehler, E. pers. comm., and Woehler, E. and 
Olivier, F. unpublished data (December 2001). 
 
The topography of the Frazier Islands is characterised by steep cliffs rising from the 
sea.  The highest peak on Nelly Island is approximately 65 metres.  There is a broad 
‘U’ shaped ice-filled valley on both Nelly and Dewart Islands.  
 
The geology of the Frazier Islands is typical of the Windmill Islands group and is 
characterised by the layered schists and finely crenulated gneisses of the Windmill 
metamorphics.  The geological character of the Frazier Islands developed as a result 
of two phases of metamorphosis at 1400-1310Ma and about 1200Ma of pre-existing 
volcanics, greywacke and shale.  On Nelly Island there are steep cliffs of biotite and 
gneiss.  A red sandstone erratic is located in the ‘U’ shaped valley on Nelly Island 
below the 30m contour26.  Highly polished glacial striae in the gneisses provide 
evidence of recent glaciation and indicate the former direction of ice flow of 265º and 
280º T.  Surface sediments consist of fine gravelly sand located in bedrock 
depressions27. 
 
 
7 
The climate at the Frazier Islands is characteristic of that experienced at the Windmill 
Islands and other Antarctic coastal locations in the region.  At Casey Station, located 
16 kilometres to the ESE of the Frazier Islands group, mean temperatures are 0.3°C 
for the warmest month and –14.9°C for the coldest month.  Precipitation is low and 
the high albedo of the exposed rock surfaces results in persistent ice-free areas that 
provide attractive nesting sites for the avifauna.  
 
7. 
Permit conditions 
 
Visits to the Frazier Islands ASPA are prohibited except in accordance with a Permit 
issued by an appropriate National Authority.  National Antarctic Programs operating 
in the region shall consult with each other to ensure that the frequency of visits does 
not exceed that permitted in the Management Plan.  Permits to enter the Area may be 
issued during the non-breeding period for Southern Giant Petrels, specifically from  
1 May to 30 September, for compelling scientific research that cannot be undertaken 
elsewhere, or for essential management purposes consistent with the objectives and 
provisions of the Management Plan.  Permits are only to be issued for research that 
will not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the Area, or interfere with 
existing scientific studies. 
 
Only one Permit is to be issued for the purpose of conducting a seabird census in each 
5 year period.  The Permit issuing authority is to refer to the provision under the first 
dot point of section 3 of this management plan when issuing Permits.  Censuses are to 
be conducted from outside the Giant Petrel colonies, wherever practicable.  In most 
cases there are vantage points from where the nesting birds may be counted.  The 
maximum time to be spent on the Frazier Islands is 12 hours in total;  however, the 
census may involve several visits to the islands.  Only the two persons named in the 
Permit may be ashore within the Area at any time.  The boat operator and others 
should remain at the shoreline for safety reasons.  
 
Permits should include a condition that the Permit or a copy shall be carried at all 
times when within the Area.  Additional conditions, consistent with the objectives and 
provisions of the Management Plan, may be included by the issuing authority.  The 
principal Permit holder for each Permit issued should be required to submit to the 
Permit issuing authority a visit report detailing all activities undertaken within the 
Area, and including all census data obtained during the visit. 
 
7(i) Access to, and movement within or over the Area 
 
• 
Vehicles are prohibited within the Area; 
• 
The only permitted access to the Frazier Islands is by watercraft (Appendix 
2).  Landings must be made at the designated sites as marked on Map C.  
Boats used to visit the islands must be left at the shoreline and movement 
within the Area is by foot only.  Only personnel who are required to carry 
out scientific/management work in the Area should leave the landing site; 
• 
No IRBs (inflatable rubber boats) are to be operated on the plane and no 
watercraft is to be operated in excess of 5 knots boat speed within 2500ft 
(750m) of the Frazier Islands (Map C);  
 
8 
• 
Any movement within the Area is to be consistent with the minimum approach 
distances to nesting birds specified in Appendix 3.  Persons shall not approach 
closer than is necessary to obtain census data or biological data from any 
nesting Southern Giant Petrels, and in no case closer than 20m;  and 
 
• 
To reduce disturbance to wildlife, noise levels including verbal 
communication is to be kept to a minimum.  The use of motor-driven tools and 
any other activity likely to generate noise and thereby cause disturbance to 
nesting birds is prohibited within the Area during the breeding period for 
Southern Giant Petrels (1 October to 30 April). 
 
Aircraft may be used subject to the following conditions: 
• 
aircraft operations within 2500ft (750m) horizontally and vertically of the 
islands for single engine aircraft and 5000ft (1500m) horizontally and 
vertically for double-engine aircraft, are prohibited during the breeding 
season for Southern Giant Petrels (1 October to 30 April):  Map C and 
Appendix 2; 
• 
aircraft (including helicopter) overflights for aerial photography within the 
distances specified above are allowed at intervals of 5 years, consistent with 
guidelines to reduce disturbance.  In such cases, the approach to the Frazier 
Islands should be along the designated flight path (Map C) from a west or 
north-west direction given the prevailing easterly winds; 
• 
landing of aircraft in the Area is prohibited at any time; 
• 
refuelling is prohibited within the Area at any time. 
7(ii) Activities which are, or may be conducted within the Area, including 
restrictions on time and place 
The following activities may be conducted within the Area from 1 May to  
30 September as authorised in a Permit; 
• 
scientific research consistent with the Management Plan for the Area that 
will not jeopardise the values for which the Area has been designated or the 
ecosystems of the Area; 
• 
compelling management activities, including monitoring;  and 
• 
sampling, which should be the minimum required for approved research 
programs. 
7(iii) Installation, modification, or removal of structures 
No permanent structures are to be erected in the Area. 
7(iv) Location of field camps 
Camping is prohibited in the Frazier Islands ASPA except in an emergency. 
 
 
9 
7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms that may be brought into the Area 
• 
Fuel is not to be depoted on the islands.  Boat refuelling is permitted at 
shoreline landing sites.  A small amount of fuel is permitted for an 
emergency stove. 
• 
No poultry products, including dried food containing egg powder, are to be 
taken into the Area. 
• 
No herbicides or pesticides are to be brought into the Area. 
• 
Any chemical which may be introduced for compelling scientific purposes as 
authorised in a Permit shall be removed from the Area, at or before the 
conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted.  The use of 
radio-nucleides or stable isotopes is prohibited. 
• 
No animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately 
introduced into the Area and precautions shall be taken against accidental 
introductions.  All equipment and clothing should be thoroughly cleaned 
before entering the Area. 
7(vi) Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna 
• 
Taking of, or harmful interference with, native flora and fauna, is prohibited 
unless specifically authorised by permit issued in accordance with Article 3 
of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty.  Activities involving Giant Petrels are governed by this management 
plan.  
• 
Disturbance of Southern Giant Petrels should be avoided at all times.   
7(vii) Collection or removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit 
holder 
• 
Material may only be collected or removed from the Area as authorised in a 
Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or 
management needs. 
• 
Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which 
was not brought into the Area by the Permit holder or otherwise authorised, 
may be removed unless the impact of the removal is likely to be greater than 
leaving the material in situ.  If such material is found the appropriate 
Authority must be notified. 
7(viii) Disposal of waste 
No wastes, including human wastes, are to be deposited or left in the Area. 
7(ix) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the 
management plan continue to be met 
• 
A census of Southern Giant Petrels should be conducted in each 5 year 
period.  Censuses of other species may be undertaken during this visit 
provided no additional disturbance is caused to the Southern Giant Petrels. 
 
10
• 
The maximum length of time to be spent at the Frazier Islands to conduct a 
bird census is 12 hours in total; however, several visits may comprise the 12 
hour period.   
• 
Novel GPS data shall be obtained for specific sites of long-term monitoring 
for lodgement with the Antarctic Data Directory System through the 
appropriate National Authority. 
7(x)  Requirement for reports 
Parties should ensure that the principal Permit Holder for each permit issued submits 
to the appropriate national authority a report on activities undertaken. Such reports 
should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form 
suggested by SCAR. Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the 
Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities 
conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient 
detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Plan of Management. Parties 
should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a 
publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be both in any review of 
the Plan of Management and in organising the scientific use of the Area. A copy of 
the report should be forwarded to the National Party responsible for development of 
the Management Plan to assist in management of the Area, and monitoring of bird 
populations, additionally visit reports should provide detailed information on census 
data, locations of any new colonies or nests not previously recorded, a brief 
summary of research findings and copies of photographs taken of the Area 
7(xi) Emergency provision 
Exceptions to restrictions outlined in the management plan are in an emergency as 
specified in Article 11 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to 
the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol).
