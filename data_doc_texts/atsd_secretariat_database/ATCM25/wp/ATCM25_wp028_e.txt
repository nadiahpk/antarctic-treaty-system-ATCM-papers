Argentine contribution to the definition of the 
staff structure of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat1


Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to assist to the definition of the staff structure that the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat will require since the beginning of its permanent period.

Among others, the following background documents have been taken into account: XXIV ATCM/WP 37, XXIV ATCM / IP 6, the CCAMLR documents “Deadlines for key intersessional events 2001/2002” and “Specific tasks identified by the Commission for the 2001/02 intersessional period”, Report by the Group of Experts that conducted the administrative assessment of the CCAMLR Executive Secretariat in 1997, the CCAMLR advertisement for selection of a new Executive Secretary and the Chairman’s Report on the Informal Meeting of the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty on the Establishment of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat held in Buenos Aires, June 24-27, 2002.

The paper lists the functions the Secretariat would have pursuant to the Annex II of the Chairman’s Report of the Buenos Aires meeting. It also includes a minimum required staff proposal, with the allocation of responsibilities for the specific tasks identified, in order to ensure, from a practical point of view, performance of the Secretariat´s functions.
 

A. Functions of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat

The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat will have functions aimed to expediting and enhancing the efficiency of the current working scheme of the Consultative Parties, in accordance with the mandate established in the constitutive instrument. During the Informal Meeting of Buenos Aires, the following functions have been identified (see Annex II of the Chairman’s Report):

B. Antarctic Treaty Secretariat Staff

Taking into account the functions described above and the wish of several Consultative Parties to have a small but efficient structure, Argentina suggests the following staff structure, with responsibilities allocated for the specific tasks: 

B.1. Positions 3, 4, 5, 6

    • Executive Secretary
    • Financial and Administrative Officer 
    • Data Manager / Web Master / Net Administrator
    • Coordinator of Translations and Publications / Documentation
    • Translators (3)7
    • Receptionist / Personal Assistant to the Executive Secretary 
    • Computer /IT type person / Administrative Assistant 

B.2. Duties 8 , 9

This is a preliminary approach to each position duties. It needs to be further developed.

Executive Secretary

    • Coordinate secretariat support for meetings held under the Antarctic Treaty and to the Protocol on Environmental Protection;
    • Facilitate the required coordination with the Antarctic Treaty System components and with international organizations linked to the System.  
    • Coordinate the preparation of reports on the activities carried out by the Secretariat;
    • Ensure the efficient operation of the Secretariat.
    • Appoint Secretariat staff and develop work programs for the staff.
    • Develop and implement a performance assessment process for every staff member.
    • Oversee the task of collecting, collating and disseminating information pursuant to the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty and of the Protocol; provide regular reports on the status of the ATCM and CEP databases, in cooperation with the data manager.
    • Prepare the financial budget for expenditure and forecast budgets for consideration by the ATCM, and ensure that expenditure is in accordance with the approved budget allocations.

Financial and Administrative Officer

    • Exercise the functions of the Executive Secretary during his absence.
    • Assist the Executive Secretary in managing the Secretariat.
    • Maintain the financial records of the Secretariat. 
    • Prepare the interim budget and distribute it among the Parties for consideration.
    • Prepare the Financial Statements or Budgets and distribute them among the Parties.
    • Perform audits of the Financial Statements and distribute the related Report among the Parties.

Data Manager / Web Master / Net Administrator 

    • Establish and operate the IT media and installations of the Secretariat, including the Secretariat’s network and website;
    • Facilitate and coordinate communications and the exchange of information among the Consultative Parties, in particular exchanges  pursuant to the Antarctic Treaty and the Antarctic Treaty Protocol on Environmental Protection;
    • Establish databases on the operation of the Antarctic Treaty;
    • Attend to and keep up to date the website on information exchange.

Coordinator of Translations and Publications / Documentation

    • Ensure proper translation of the ATCM and CEP document;.
    • Maintain the records of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and of other meetings held within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty and make information about the Antarctic Treaty available;
    • Distribute  ATCM and CEP Papers;
    • Publish and distribute  ATCM and CEP Final Reports;
    • Develop, at the request of the Consultative Parties, common and standardized formats for the information to be exchanged pursuant to the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and of the Protocol.

The Receptionist / Assistant to the Executive Secretary and the Computer /IT type person / Administrative Assistant should have the responsibilities allocated to them by the Executive Secretary.


B.3. Staff categories 10 , 11

The positions that will fall into the Executive Category and those that will fall into the General Category need to be defined. Argentina’s view is that, in principle, it is only necessary for the Executive Secretary to belong to the Professional Category. If essential for the purpose of representing the Executive Secretary during his absence, the Financial and Administrative Officer  [or the Environmental Officer] should also belong to this category.  

Argentina considers most advisable to ask the CCAMLR Secretariat to provide full assistance on these matters, taking into account its valuable expertise regarding organizational matters.12

Argentina also thinks that it could be worthwhile to apply to the United Nations International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) for an external assessment (obviously, nonbinding, for the Consultative Parties) to be conducted in connection with the agreed staff categories. A similar, but ex post facto analysis, was conducted by the ICSC with regard to the CCAMLR (CCAMLR-VIII/6) staff. In the case of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, it could be advisable to conduct the analysis a priori, in the understanding that its outcome may provide analytical tools for the Consultative Parties, by identifying the variables that need to be taken into account for staff determination. The view is that in order for the ICSC to be in a position to give advice to the Consultative Parties, it would be necessary to develop and provide to it certain background, such as a description of the organization and activities of the ATCM, the functions and work program of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, etc.

It would be advisable to compare the results of this consultation with the results of the review currently being conducted by the Chairman of the SCAF in connection with the United Nations pay scheme for Professional Staff of the CCAMLR Executive Secretariat and its relation with local cost-of-living variations in Australia.


C. Suggestions to the Consultative Parties

To summarize, Argentina believes that the following topics should be addressed and defined:

    1. Antarctic Treaty Secretariat staff’s positions (B.1.);
    2. Duties of each position (B.2.);
    3. Staff’s categories (B.3.);
    4. To ask CCAMLR Secretariat for full assistance on these matters;
    5. To consider the convenience to consult independently with the ICSC;
    6. To take account of the conclusions reached by SCAF in connection with the CCAMLR Staff;
