Antarctic Protected Areas System:
Revised Management Plans for

North-east Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 135
and
Marine Plain, Mule Peninsula, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 143





















 Submitted by Australia

Protected Areas:
Revision of Management Plans for: North-east Bailey Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.135, and Marine Plain, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No 143


Consistent with Resolution 1 (1998) of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXII, Australia has revised the Management Plans for North-east Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.135, and Marine Plain, Mule Peninsula, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 143.

The Plans have been reformatted to accord with the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, appended to resolution 2 (1998) of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXII and the requirements of Annex V to the Madrid Protocol.

There have been no substantial changes to the provisions of the existing Management Plans, although the new format has required some sections of the Plans to be enhanced. The ongoing protection of the Areas is warranted.

The opportunity has also been taken to make a minor alteration to the boundary for the Marine Plain Antarctic Specially Protected Area. This amendment to the boundary, which has no effect upon the values for which the Area was originally nominated, is to reduce the possibility of ingress to the Area from a nearby pedestrian route.

It is recommended that Parties adopt the revised Management Plans. A draft Measure to this effect is attached.

and which are annexed to this Measure, be adopted.
MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ANTARCTIC SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA NO. 135, NORTH-EAST BAILEY PENINSULA, BUDD COAST, WILKES LAND
Introduction
North-east Bailey Peninsula was designated in 1985 as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No 16 through Recommendation XIII-8 (1983), after a proposal by Australia. In accordance with Resolution XX -5 (1996) the site was redesignated and renumbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 135. This revised Management Plan reaffirms the scientific values of the original designation. The Area was originally designated because it is representative of a diverse assemblage of vegetation with extremely rich lichen and moss beds and an important stand of liverwort, these values are reaffirmed in this revised Management Plan.
1. Description of Values to be Protected
Excluding the Antarctic Peninsula, Bailey Peninsula, among Clark and Mitchell Peninsulas, and Robinson Ridge in the Windmill Islands region support some of the most extensive and best-developed plant communities on continental Antarctica. The region has rich associations of macrolichens and bryophytes that occupy very specific ecological niches. The flora of the Windmill Islands region comprises 36 species of lichen, five bryophyte species, a liverwort, and 150 non-marine algae and 120 fungal taxa have been recorded. An ascomycete mycorrhizal fungus has been shown in the liverwort Cephaloziella varians. Three species of the lichen genus Lecidea have been observed and await description.
Eleven cryptogamic sociations have been identified. The vegetation forms a continuum of ecological variation along environmental gradients of soil moisture, soil chemistry, and microclimate. On the peninsulas, the major community types are distinguished by the dominance of three bipolar lichens, Usnea sphacelata, Pseudephebe minuscula and Umbilicaria decussata. Vegetation communities on the islands are dominated by algal species such as Prasiola crispa, with moss and lichen being considerably poorer developed than on the peninsulas. Mosses and lichens are all but absent in eutrophic sites near bird colonies with a preponderance of Prasiola crispa, Prasiococcus calcareous and Desmococcus olivaceus chlorophyte algae occurring. Lichens constitute the largest part of the Windmill Islands flora with bryophytes being dominant in moister areas.
North-eastern Bailey Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area is representative of a diverse assemblage of the Windmill Islands flora. As such, the Area has intrinsic ecological value and scientific importance, particularly to botanists, microbiologists, soil scientists and glacial geomorphologists.
The Area contains three extensive and contrasting moss fields that are the subject of taxonomic, ecological and physiological studies that commenced during the summer of 1982-3. Additional studies include population ecology of invertebrates associated with the vegetation, and soil/water chemistry. Permanent lichen growth monitoring sites have also been established as have sites monitoring annual growth increments in mosses. The cryptogamic plant communities are also being observed in relation to short-term microclimate fluctuation and long-term climate change in the region since deglaciation 8000-5000 years BP. Studies in the Area have also been undertaken as part of the Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) program. More recent  studies have concentrated on the determination of biodiversity, physiological and biochemical attributes, component interactions, impact of anthropogenic pollutants, and potential effects of global climate change. Casey Station is a nominated study site under the Regional Sensitivity to Climate Change in Antarctic Terrestrial and Limnetic Ecosystems (RiSCC) international research program on Antarctic and Peri-Antarctic terrestrial and limnetic organisms and ecosystems.
Moss and lichen communities are used to monitor the environmental impacts of Casey Station. The Area provides baseline data with which to compare changes in similar plant communities in the immediate surroundings of Casey Station. The Area also serves as a valuable comparative site for similar plant communities on Clark Peninsula, which are subject to less stress and disturbance.
Proximity to Casey Station minimises logistics problems with respect to field research and, at the same time, maximises the potential for disturbance of study areas. It is primarily for this reason that this Area, where research is concentrated, requires protection.
2. Aims and Objectives
Management at North-eastern Bailey Peninsula aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of the Area by preventing unnecessary human disturbance and sampling in the Area;
    • preserve a part of the natural ecosystem as a reference area for the purpose of future comparative studies and to assess direct and indirect effects of Casey Station;
    • allow scientific research on the ecosystem in the Area provided it is for compelling reasons which cannot be served elsewhere;
    • minimise the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area;
    • allow for maintenance of the Tandem Delta antenna communications installation and associated facilities without degradation of the Area’s values;
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the Management Plan.
3. Management Activities
The following management activities will be undertaken to protect the values of the Area:
    • signs illustrating the location and boundaries, with clear statements of entry restrictions, shall be placed at appropriate locations at the boundaries of the Area to help avoid inadvertent entry;
    • information on the location of the Area (stating special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and a copy of this Management Plan shall be kept available, at the adjacent  Casey Station and will be provided to ships visiting the vicinity;
    • markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition and removed when no longer required;
    • abandoned equipment or materials shall be removed to the maximum extent possible provided doing so does not adversely impact on the values of the Area;
    • visit the Area as necessary (no less than once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure that management activities are adequate: and
    • review the Management Plan at least every five years and update as required.
4. Period of Designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

6. Description of the Area
6(i) Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features
General Description
The North-east Bailey Peninsula Antarctic Specially Managed Area is approximately 0.28 square kilometres in area and located on Bailey Peninsula adjacent to the Windmill Islands Group on the Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, (Maps A and B). Bailey Peninsula is an area of rock exposures and permanent snow and ice fields and lies between Newcomb Bay and O’Brien Bay, two kilometres south of Clark Peninsula. The Area consists of an irregular area of exposed rock during summer on the northeast of Bailey Peninsula, approximately 70 metres south of Brown Bay with Casey Station close by to the west, and is located at 66°16’59.9”S, 110°31’59.9”E. Boundary coordinates for the Area are shown in Appendix I, Table 1. Topographically, Bailey Peninsula comprises low lying, rounded ice-free rocky outcrops (maximum altitude approximately 40 metres), and, approximately three kilometres east rising to the Løken Moraines (altitude approximately 130 metres). Intervening valleys are filled with permanent snow or ice, or glacial moraine and exfoliated debris and contain water catchment areas. The topography of Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map C.
Climate
The climate of the Windmill Islands area is frigid-Antarctic. Meteorological data for the period 1957 to 1983, from Casey Station (altitude 32 m) on Bailey Peninsula show mean temperatures for the warmest and coldest months of 0.3 and -14.9˚C, respectively, with extreme temperatures ranging from 9.2 to -41˚C, mean annual temperature for the period was –9.3˚C. The climate is dry with a mean annual snowfall of 195 mm year-1 (rainfall equivalent), precipitation as rain has been recorded in the summer. However, within the last decade the mean annual temperature has changed to –9.1˚C and mean annual snowfall to 230 mm year-1 (rainfall equivalent).
There is an annual average of 96 days with gale-force winds, which are predominantly easterly in direction, off the polar ice cap. Blizzards are a frequent occurrence especially during winter. Snowfall is common during the winter, but the extremely strong winds scour the exposed areas of the Peninsula of snow. On most hill crests on Bailey Peninsula snow gathers in the lee of rock outcrops and in depressions in the substratum. Further down the slopes snow forms deeper drifts.
Geology and Soils
The Windmill Islands represent one of the eastern most outcrops of a Mesoproterozoic low-pressure granulite facies terrain that extends west to the Bunger Hills and further to the Archaean complexes in Princess Elizabeth Land, to minor exposures in the east in the Dumont D’Urville area and in Commonwealth Bay. The total outcrop areas do not exceed more than a few square kilometres. The Mesoproterozoic outcrop of the Windmill Islands and the Archaean complexes of Princess Elizabeth Land are two the few major areas in East Antarctica that can be directly correlated with an Australian equivalent in a Gondwana reconstruction.
The Mesoproterozoic facies terrain  comprise a series of migmatitic metapelites and metapsammites interlayered with mafic to ultramafic and felsic sequences with rare calc-silicates, large partial melt bodies (Windmill Island supacrustals), undeformed granite, charnockite, gabbro, pegmatite, aplites and cut by easterly-trending late dolerite dykes. Bailey Peninsula is part of a the northern gradation of a metamorphic grade transition which separates the northern part of the Windmill Islands area from the southern part. The metamorpohic grade ranges from amphibolite facies, sillimanite-biotite-orthoclase in the north at Clark Peninsula, through biotite-cordierite-almandine granulite, to hornblende-orthopyroxene granulite at Browning Peninsula in the south. The Ardery Charnockite of the south is prone to deep weathering and crumbles readily because of its mineral assemblage, whereas the metamorphic sequences of the northerly parts of the region have a much more stable mineral assemblage and crystalline structure. This difference has a significant influence on the distribution of vegetation in the Windmill Islands with the northern rock types providing a more suitable substrate for slow growing lichens.
The leucocratic granite gneiss which constitutes the main outcrop on Bailey Peninsula, may be subdivided into leucogneiss and two different types of garnet-bearing gneiss. The outcrop on Bailey Peninsula is characterised as a garnet-bearing gneiss type 1 which is  white, medium grained and foliated. The foliation is defined by the alignment of an early biotite generation that is tight to openly folded, with a garnet and a later biotite generation that overgrows the fabric. Unmetamorphosed and undeformed dolerite dykes occur over Bailey Peninsula such as at “Penguin Pass” (-66°17’18”, 110°33’16”E), to the south west of the ASPA. Small outcrops of metapelite, metapsammite and leuco- gneisses occur on the Peninsula. Recent geochronology of the rocks of the Windmill Islands suggest two major phases of metamorphism, the first at c. 1400-1310 Ma, an upper amphibolite facies event, followed by a granulite facies overprint c. 1210-1180 Ma. The geology of Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map F.
The Windmill Islands region was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene. The southern region of the Windmill Islands was deglaciated by 8000 corr. yr B.P., and the northern region, including Bailey Peninsula deglaciated by 5500 corr. yr B.P.  Isostatic up lift has occurred at a rate of between 0.5 and 0.6 m/100 yr, with the upper mean marine limit,  featured as ice-pushed ridges, being observed on Bailey Peninsula at approximately 30 metres where they extend in continuous rows from the present sea-level.
Soils on Bailey Peninsula are derived from weathered gneiss, moraine deposits and outwash gravels stemming from glacial episodes. Seabirds have a large impact on soil formation in the entire landscape. Soils are frozen much of the year, during summer the upper 30-60 cm thaws with the few top centimetres, refreezing at night. Soils are mainly formed by cryoturbation and cryoclastic weathering. In the vicinity of Casey Station most soils are classified by Blume, Kuhn and Bölter as cryosols with lithic, leptic, skeletal, turbic and stagnic subunits. Other soils in the area are gelic subunits of histosols, podzols, and regosols, boulder and rock outcrops with ecto- and enolithic flora are classified as Lithosols. The soils of Bailey Peninsula are shown at Map G.
Cold monomictic lakes and ponds occur throughout the Windmill Islands in bedrock depressions and are usually ice-free during January and February. Nutrient rich lakes are found near the coast , in close proximity to penguin colonies or abandoned colonies, sterile lakes are located further inland and are fed by meltwater and local precipitation. A number of these lakes and ponds occur across Bailey Peninsula with two large lakes located 500 metres to the west of the  Area. Two ponds occur within the protected Area, the largest being approximately 75 metres by 50 metres and the smaller approximately 25 metres diameter. The distribution of lakes and ponds on Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map E.
Vegetation
The vegetation of Bailey Peninsula is exceptionally well developed and diverse and represents one of the most important botanical sites on continental Antarctica. Within the relatively complex plant communities and contrasting habitats found on Bailey Peninsula, are found at least 23 lichens, three mosses, and an important stand of liverwort. The flora forms dense stands of macrolichens and in the moister and more sheltered areas bryophytes form closed stands of 25-50 m2 moss turf up to 30 cm in depth. The lichens, Umbilicaria decussata, Pseudephebe minuscula and Usnea sphacelata with mixed bryophytes dominate the vegetation cover of most of the ice-free areas, particularly on the north-east and centre of the Peninsula in dense lichen communities similar to those found on Clark Peninsula. Remnant penguin colonies are dominated by Xanthoria candelaria, Candelariella hallettensis, Buellia frigida and Usnea antarctica. The most complex bryophyte communities are restricted to small locally moist hollows adjacent to melt pools and streams in the central north-east and central parts of the Peninsula. Vegetation is absent or poorly developed on the ice-free areas of the Peninsula’s southern coast. Annex I, Table 2 provides a list of bryophytes and lichens identified on Bailey Peninsula.
Two principal cryptogamic subformations are recognised; a lichen dominated association of  Usnea-Pseudephebe-Umbilicaria-Buellia, comprising five  closely related sociations occupying a variety of windswept substrata ranging from bedrock to gravel, and, a short cushion and turf moss subformation of Ceratodon-Schistidium-Rinodina comprising four moss dominated sociations. The vegetation of Bailey Peninsula is shown at Map D.
At least 145 taxa of non-marine algae and cyanobacteria flora have been isolated and include 50 cyanobacteria, 70 chlorophytes and 23 chromophytes. The taxa have been found in snow and ice, soil, rocks, ephemeral ponds, tarns and lakes, 24 of these cyanobacterial and algal species occur in the snow. Snow algae are abundant and widespread in the icy corridors between the rocky outcrops and in semi-permanent snow drifts. A list of cyanobacterial and algal species from the Windmill Islands is shown in Appendix I, Table 3.
The vegetated soils of Bailey Peninsula contain fungal hyphae, yeasts, fungal propagules, an assortment of algae, cyanobacteria, protozoa, and provide a significant habitat for soil microfauna such as nematodes, mites, rotifers and tardigrades. There is relatively low fungal diversity in the Windmill Islands, with 35 taxa representing 22 genera of fungi being isolated from soils, mosses, algae and lichens. Compared with mosses and algae, fungal distribution and diversity are poor in lichens. Thirty taxa have been detected in the soils in the vicinity of Casey Station with twelve of these taxa restricted to anthropologically influenced soils around the station, Penicillium species dominated in these sites. Eight fungi taxa have been isolated from soils within the Area. More broadly within the Windmill Islands region, 21 taxa have been isolated from the mosses, Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus and Grimmia antarctici, with 12 taxa isolated from algae and 6 taxa from the lichens, Xanthoria candelaria, Umbilicaria decussata and Usnea sphacelata. A number of fungi have also been found associated with animals of the region. Appendix I, Table 4 provides detail of the taxa and their source.
Birds
Four species of birds are known to nest in the vicinity of Bailey Peninsula. These include Adélie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, which is the most abundant bird species in the area. The nearest breeding colony is on Shirley Island about 1.5 km west of Casey Station. Snow Petrels Pagodroma nivea, are seen all year-round and breed throughout the Windmill Islands including Reeve Hill about 750 metres west of the Area and Budnick Hill, 600 metres to the northwest. Wilson’s Storm Petrel Oceanites oceanicus, breeds throughout the Windmill Islands region. The Antarctic Skua Catharacta maccormicki, breeds throughout the Windmill Islands at widely dispersed nests, mostly near Adélie Penguin colonies.
Other birds that breed in the Windmill Islands but not in the immediate vicinity of Bailey Peninsula include the Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus, the Cape Petrel Daption capense, the Southern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides and the Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica antarctica. The Emperor Penguin Aptenodytes forsteri is a common visitor to the Windmill Islands and a breeding colony of approximately 2000 pairs is established in the area of Peterson Bank.
Seals
When the sea ice breaks out Weddell Seals, Leptonychotes weddelli, are seen regularly hauling out around Bailey Peninsula. These seals are seen year round in the Windmill Islands and their main breeding area is on the sea ice between Herring Island and the continent, about 15 km south‑east of Casey Station. A secondary pupping site is in the Swain Group, 7 km north‑east of the station. Browning Peninsula and Peterson Island (about 20 km south of Casey) are the main haul out areas for Southern Elephant Seals Mirounga leonina in the Windmill Islands. The majority of the animals are immature males that haul out to moult during summer but there have also been observations of mature bulls and mature and immature cows. The Windmill Islands is the only known place in Continental Antarctica where Southern Elephant Seals have been observed pupping. Small numbers of Crabeater Seals Lobodon carcinophagus are also sighted in the Windmill Islands area during summer. Leopard Seals, Hydrurga leptonyx, are often sighted during the summer, particularly in the vicinity of the Adélie Penguin colonies on Shirley Island and Whitney Point, Clark Peninsula.
Terrestrial invertebrates and microbial communities
The Antarctic flea Glaciopsyllus antarcticus, has been found in the nests of  Southern fulmars, Fulmarus glacialoides. The anopluran louse, Antarctophthirus ogmorhini, is found on the Weddell Seal,  Leptonychotes weddelli. A number of species of mallophagan lice have also been found on birds.
The mite Nanorchestes antarcticus has been found on Bailey Peninsula at sites characterised as having sandy or gravelly soils, free of extensive moss or lichen cover, and moist but not water-logged. Collembola have not been recorded from the Windmill Islands.
Five species of tardigrades have been collected on Bailey Peninsula, Pseudechiniscus suillus, Macrobiotus sp., Hypsibius antarcticus, Ramajendas frigidus and Diphascon chilenense. Significant positive associations between bryophytes and the most common species of tardigrades, P. suillus, H. antarcticus and D. chilenense, have been found, and strong negative associations between those species and algae and lichens have been established. No systematic or ecological accounts of nematodes have yet been published for the Windmill Islands region.
Protozoa have been studied on Bailey Peninsula and ciliates and testate amoebae are active. Twenty seven ciliate species and six testacean species have been found in the vicinity of Casey Station. The species are shown in Table 2.
6(ii) Special Zones within the Area
There are no special zones within the Area.
6(iii) Location of Structures within and adjacent to the Area
Casey Station is located west of the northern portion of the Area. Prior to the designation of the Area as a protected site in 1986 an array of radio transmitters had been established on the site progressively from 1964. During the summer of 2001/20002 redundant aerials and infrastructure were removed. A number of structures remain within the Area. These are a small storage rack in the north-west of the Area, the transmitter building and rigging store of 52.3 m2, a 45 metre high tandem delta antenna mast located in the south east of the protected area. Another 35 metre mast is located approximately 100 metres south of the Area.
6(iv) Location of other Protected Areas in the vicinity
The nearest protected area to North-east Bailey Peninsula is Clark Peninsula, Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 136, 2.5 km north-east of Bailey Peninsula, across Newcomb Bay, adjacent to abandoned Wilkes Station. Antarctic Specially Protected Area, No. 103, Ardery Island, 6622’S, 11027’E, and Odbert Island, 6622’S, 11033’E, Budd Coast lying in Vincennes Bay, is approximately 11 km south of Casey Station, west of Robinson Ridge.
7. Permit Conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a permit issued by an appropriate National Authority. A permit to enter the Area may only be issued for compelling scientific research, or for essential management purposes consistent with the Management Plan’s objectives and provisions, and providing that the actions permitted will not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the Area or interfere with existing scientific studies. Conditions that must be included in the permit are that the permit or an authorised copy shall be carried within the Area, and that the permit specify the period for specific activities. Additional conditions, consistent with the Management Plan’s objectives and provisions, may be included by the issuing Authority.
7(i) Access to and Movement within or over the Area
Vehicles are prohibited within the Area and access should be by foot. Helicopters are prohibited from landing within the area. Visitors should avoid walking on visible vegetation. Care should be exercised walking in areas of moist ground, where foot traffic can easily damage sensitive soils, plant or algae communities, and degrade water quality: walk around such areas, on ice or rocky ground. Pedestrian traffic should be kept to the minimum necessary consistent with the objectives of any permitted activities and every reasonable effort should be made to minimise impacts.
7(ii) Activities which are or may be conducted within the Area, including restrictions on time and place
    • Compelling scientific research which cannot be undertaken elsewhere and which will not jeopardise the ecosystem of the Area;
    • Essential management activities, including monitoring;
    • Sampling, but this should be the minimum required for the approved research programs; and
    • Maintenance and activities associated with the antennas and transmitter facility.
7(iii) Installation, modification or removal of structures
Any structures erected or installed within the Area are to be specified in a Permit. Permanent structures or installations are prohibited. Scientific markers and equipment must be secured and maintained in good condition, clearly identifying the permitting country, name of principal investigator and year of installation. All such items should be made of materials that pose minimum risk of contamination of the Area. Removal of equipment associated with scientific research before the permit for that research expires, shall be a condition of the permit.. Details of markers and equipment left in situ (GPS locations, description, tags, etc. and expected “use by date”) should be reported to the permitting Authority.
7(iv) Location of field camps
Parties are prohibited from camping within in the Area. 
7(v) Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the area
    • No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and precautions shall be taken against accidental introductions.
    • No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the Area. Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, which may be introduced for scientific or management purposes specified in a permit, shall be removed from the Area at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the permit was granted.
    • Fuel is not to be stored in the Area unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the permit has been granted. Permanent depots are not permitted.
    • All material introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction to the environment is minimised.
7(vi) Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna is prohibited, except in accordance with a permit. Where taking or harmful interference with animals is involved this should, as a minimum standard, be in accordance with the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals For Scientific Purposes in Antarctica.
7(vii) Collection and removal of anything not brought into the area by the permit holder
Material may be collected or removed from the Area only in accordance with a permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs.
Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, and which was not brought into the Area by the permit holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of the removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ: if this is the case the appropriate Authority must be notified and approval obtained.
7(viii) Disposal of waste
All wastes, including all human wastes, shall be removed from the Area.
7(ix) Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met
Permits may be granted to enter the Area to carry out biological monitoring and Area inspection and management activities, which may involve the collection of small samples for analysis or review, to erect or maintain signposts, or for other protective measures.
Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked.
To help maintain the ecological and scientific values of the plant communities found in the Area persons entering the Area shall take special precautions against introductions. Of particular concern are microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils at other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica. To minimise the risk of introductions footwear and any equipment to be used in the Area – including sampling equipment and markers – shall be thoroughly cleaned before entering the Area.
7(x) Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal permit holder for each permit issued submit to the appropriate Authority a report describing the activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR. Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Management Plan. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage; to be used both in any review of the Management Plan and in organising the scientific use of the Area.

MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ANTARCTIC SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA NO. 143
MARINE PLAIN, MULE PENINSULA, VESTFOLD HILLS, PRINCESS ELIZABETH LAND

Introduction
Marine Plain was originally designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 25 in 1987 (ATCM Recommendation XIV-5). In accordance with Resolution V (1996), this site is redesignated and renumbered as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 143.
This revised Plan of Management reaffirms the scientific values of the original designation and accords with Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection.
The Vestfold Hills is an ice-free area of low altitude, undulating hills and hundreds of lakes and ponds. Marine Plain (6837’50”S, 7807’55”E) is located on Mule Peninsula in the southwest of the Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica (Map A). Through ASPA designation, this sensitive area can be protected for future studies of the palaeoenvironment of Antarctica.
1. Description of Values to be Protected 
Marine Plain is representative of a major Antarctic terrestrial ice-free ecosystem with outstanding fossil fauna and rare geological features. It is of exceptional ongoing scientific interest and has been subject to several detailed geological, palaeontological, geomorphological and glaciological studies. This is the first time much of this information has been available from the coast of East Antarctica. 
Marine Plain is of exceptional scientific interest because of its relevance to the palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic record of Antarctica. The area has yielded outstanding in situ vertebrate fossil fauna including Australodelphis mirus, the first higher vertebrate named from the Oligocene-Pleistocene interval on land in Antarctica, and the first cetacean fossil from the polar margin of circum-Antarctic Southern Ocean that postdates the break-up of Gondwana. Marine Plain has also revealed four other species of cetaceans; a species of fish; and a diverse invertebrate fauna comprising molluscs, gastropods, marine diatoms, and the first Pliocene decapod crustacean from Antarctica.
Marine Plain contains a roughly horizontal section of ca 8 m thick Pliocene marine sediments known as the Sørsdal Formation (Map D), which is in some areas exposed, but elsewhere underlies Holocene sediments, up to about 1 m thick. A diatom biostratigraphy placed the Sørsdal Formation in the Fragilariopsis barronii Zone, Early Pliocene (ca 4.5-4.1 Ma). The early Pliocene deposits are crucial as a source of information on the environment at this stage of Antarctic history. The fossil fauna – including deposits of vertebrate and invertebrate species – aids in the greater understanding of the early Pliocene Antarctic environments, including high-latitude climate and oceanography. By examining the diatom microfossils, it is possible to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions of the Sørsdal Formation and test hypothetical models of ice sheet behaviour against the geological record, as well as explore the Antarctic ice sheet’s response to future global warming.
The Vestfold Hills has an ice-free area of approximately 413 km2, and are characterised by their low altitude, typically less that 180 m. The hills have been subject to intermittent glaciation and exposed rocks are characterised by polishing, striation and fracturing. The glacial striae show the direction of past ice movements. These features, together with other periglacial and glacial features have been extensively studied to investigate the region’s geomorphological and glacial history.
In addition, Marine Plain provides the largest periglacial thermokarst in East Antarctica. Sediments are normally cemented by permafrost (in addition to any cement formed during diagenesis), however thawing can lead to undercutting and collapse. The thermokarst landforms have been produced by thermal back wearing of low scarps, and include thaw pits, thaw lakes, ground ice sumps, linear depressions and very small scale beaded drainage features. Human impact may accelerate the permafrost thawing resulting in disturbance of important geomorphological values and potentially threatening fossils in the diatomite.
Intrinsically linked to this geological plain is the adjacent Burton Lake. To the west of Marine Plain, Burton Lake is a hypersaline lagoon in seasonal connection with the marine environment. This lagoon represents a stage in the biological and physio-chemical evolution of a terrestrial water body from the marine environment i.e. the geological creation of a lake.
Burton Lake, together with several smaller lakes in the ASPA, provide important examples in the spectrum of hypersaline to fresh water lake types in the Vestfold Hills and present the opportunity for important geochemical and limnological research. The interrelationships between environment and biological communities in lakes such as Burton, provide considerable insights into the evolution of the lake environments and consequently, Antarctic environmental development. It is currently the only meromictic lagoon that has been protected within East Antarctica.
Due to its proximity to Davis station (Australia), the scientific values of the Area may be compromised or damaged by accidental interference. The Area lies on the pedestrian route (Map B) to the Mule Peninsula lakes (Clear, Laternula, and McCallum) from Ellis Rapids and is easily accessible. The Area merits protection, as there is a demonstrable risk of interference which may jeopardise scientific investigation. For this reason, it is critical that fossil fauna be protected from unrecorded sampling, collection, or interference.
2. Aims and Objectives
Management for the Marine Plain ASPA aims to:
    • avoid degradation of, or substantial risk to, the values of Marine Plain by preventing unnecessary human disturbance in the ASPA;
    • allow scientific research for geological, palaeoclimatic, palaeontological, geomorphological, and limnological purposes, while ensuring protection from over-sampling;
    • allow other scientific research provided it is for compelling reasons that cannot be served elsewhere;
    • minimise the possibility of introduction of biota (including microbes) to the Area;
    • minimise damage to landforms, particularly Marine Plain; the plain south of Poseidon Lake and east of Pickard Ridge; glacial and periglacial features; and potential fossil sites; 
    • maintain the aesthetic and wilderness values of the area; and
    • allow visits for management purposes in support of the aims of the Management Plan.
3. Management Activities 
The following management activities will be undertaken to protect the values the Area:
    • information on the location of the Area (stating special restrictions that apply) shall be displayed prominently, and a copy of this Management Plan shall be kept available, at the adjacent  Davis Station, Marine Plain Refuge and will be provided to ships visiting the vicinity;
    • signs illustrating the location and boundaries, with clear statements of entry restrictions, shall be placed at appropriate locations at the boundaries of the Area to help avoid inadvertent entry;
    • require an environmental impact assessment of any activity within the ASPA in accordance with the requirements of Annex 1 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. A plan for the rehabilitation of the study site related to the activity should be submitted along with the environmental impact assessment application if appropriate;
    • markers, signs or structures erected within the Area for scientific or management purposes shall be secured and maintained in good condition and removed when no longer required;
    • abandoned equipment or materials shall be removed to the maximum extent possible provided doing so does not adversely impact on the values of the Area;
    • visit the Area as necessary (no less than once every five years) to assess whether the Area continues to serve the purposes for which it was designated and to ensure that management activities are adequate: and
    • review the Management Plan at least every five years and update as required.
4. Period of Designation
Designated for an indefinite period.

6. Description of the Area
6.1 Geographical Co-Ordinates, Boundary Markers and Natural Features
Marine Plain lies approximately 10 km southeast of Davis station in the Vestfold Hills. Marine Plain (23.4 km2, 68˚38’S, 78˚08’E) opens into an arm of Crooked Fjord on the southern side of Mule Peninsula, the southernmost of the three major peninsulas that comprise the Vestfold Hills. The Vestfold Hills are a largely ice-free oasis of approximately 413 km2 of bedrock, glacial debris, lakes, and ponds, at the eastern side of Prydz Bay, Princess Elizabeth Land. 
The boundary of SSSI 25 has been slightly altered along its northern boundaries to reduce the possibility of inadvertent entry from a nearby pedestrian route. Starting at the most northerly point of SSSI 25 the boundary description is as follows:
Commencing at 68°36’34”S, 78°09’28”E, then south-easterly to 68°36’45”S, 78°10’30”E; then south-easterly to 68°37’30”S, 78°12’30”E, then south along meridian of longitude 78°12’30”E to its intersection with the northern shore of Pineapple Lake; then west along that shore to the edge of the Sørsdal Glacier; then westerly along the northern edge of the Sørsdal Glacier to its intersection with the low water mark of the north eastern shore of  Crooked Fjord; then westerly along the low water mark of the northern shore of  Crooked Fjord (cutting across the outlet of Burton Lake into Crooked Fjord) to its intersection with the meridian of longitude 78°03’0”E; then north along meridian of longitude 78°03’0"E to its intersection with the parallel of latitude 68°37’30”S, then north-easterly to 68°36’56”S, 78°05’39”E, then north-easterly to the point of commencement.
The three major lithologies forming the Vestfold Hills (Map C) are (in order of age) Chelnok Paragneiss, Mossel Gneiss and Crooked Lake Gneiss. This is repeated in units from east-northeast to west-southwest. Intruded into these, are groups of mafic dykes in a rough north-south orientation (Map C). The dykes are a major feature of the Vestfold Hills.
The Precambrian rock is overlain in low-lying areas (approximately 10–17 m above sea level) by ca 8 m of early Pliocene (ca 4.5-3.5 Ma) diatomite with limestone lenses in the upper half. The limestone contains molluscs, especially bivalves including Chlamys tuftsensis Turner.. Holocene (ca 6.49 ka) glacial debris disconformably covers the marine deposit (0.5-1 m), extending over an area of 8-10 km2. A layer of lenticular sandstone separates the Pliocene and Holocene units. 
Low scarps in the Pliocene marine sediments have yielded a diverse array of fossil marine vertebrates and invertebrates. The cetacean specimens occur as large assemblages of vertebral columns, skulls, or complete specimens normally about 2m or more in length, in the upper 2m of the Marine Plain section. The main occurrences are along the margins of locally known “Big Ditch”, near Burton Lake, and in the scarp on the eastern side of Marine Plain. One notable cetacean fossil is Australodelphis mirus which illustrates a remarkable convergence between living dolphins (Family Delphinidae) and the living beaked whale genus Mesoplodon. 
Marine Plain has also yielded the first Pliocene decapod crustacean from Antarctica The specimen is incomplete, making it difficult to identify precisely, although it probably belongs with the Palinuridae. Other species include a beaked whale and baleen whale (and others not yet studied), possibly penguins, fish, bivalves, gastropods, serpulid worms, bryozoans, asteroids, ophiuroids, echinoids and abundant leiospheres that are probably planktonic in origin.
ASPA No. 143 includes Marine Plain (approximately 3 km2), which occupies the centre of the Area in a north-south orientation. Pickard Ridge (maximum elevation of 70 m) separates this site from Poseidon Basin in the northeast. Both locations are low-lying areas less than 20 m above sea level. Sections elsewhere above 20m are mostly low, rugged hills of Precambrian rock, and characterised at their base by a marked change in slope which may represent a Holocene shoreline. The surface of the lower area below 20 m is marked by a series of concave-to-the-south recessional moraine ridges. A series of southwesterly facing sand slopes occupy Marine Plain east of Burton Lake. 
Marine Plain has been subject to significant fluvial activity since the mid-Holocene resulting in small patches of lake sediment on its eastern side. Stream valleys and source lakes (now virtually empty) have been identified.
The Pliocene diatomite at Marine Plain appears to be the only such deposit in the Vestfold Hills. In some areas the Holocene till and glacials are very thin and consequently are easily disturbed. A thin crust over the loose powdery surface is easily crushed by footfall, releasing a plume of diatom and sand rich dust, and leaving a sharply defined, colour-contrasting footprint.
The Sørsdal Glacier (near the edge of the Antarctic ice sheet) is the southern boundary for the ice-free Vestfold Hills. A 1 km length of the northern edge of Sørsdal Glacier has retreated c. 800 m away from the southern edge of Marine Plain in the 40 years from 1947. This retreat is due to the movement through the deep channel that the glacier fills, and the propensity of ice ridges forming in the glacier and collapsing into Crooked Fjord. 
Permafrost occurs below ca 1m depth and the local landforms have evolved due to very slow progressive melting of ground ice. Terrain produced by this process is known as periglacial thermokarst because the resulting depressions give the topography an appearance similar to that of conventional limestone karst. 
Burton Lake is a major feature of the western side of the Area. This seasonally isolated marine lagoon is meromictic and hypersaline, with a maximum depth of 18 m. Burton Lake is ice-covered for 10-11 months of the year and is seasonally connected to Crooked Fjord by a tidal channel approximately 20 m wide and up to 2 m deep. The lake is isolated from Crooked Fjord for about 6-7 months of the year by ice. 
The lake contains a range of photosynthetic bacteria. The dominant species are Chlorobium vibriofome and C. limiola while minor species are Thiocapsa roseopersicina and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The lake also harbours psychrophilic bacteria which are relatively uncommon (in Antarctic coastal ice zones), and thrive on the increased availability of nutrients from continental inputs, pelagic algal blooms, and breakout of pelagic algae into the water column from ice melting in the spring and summer. One novel species of bacterium is Psychroserpens burtonensis, which has not been cultured from or recorded in any other environment. 
Marine algae are abundant in Burton Lake. A diatom floristic study of the lagoon revealed 41 diatom species. 
The ultrastructure of Postgaardi mariagerensis was reported for the first time from research in Burton Lake. This very unusual organism cannot be regarded as a euglenid but regarded as a member of the clade Euglenozoa – Euglenozoa incertae sedis.
In addition, Burton Lake is one of two lakes of the first report of choanoflagellates in Antarctic lakes, including Diaphanoeca grandis, Diaphanoeca sphaerica and Saepicula leadbeateri. It is also type location for Spiraloecion didymocostatum gen. et sp. Nov. 
Four metazoan species have been regularly recorded in the zooplankton of Burton Lake: Drepanopus bispinosus and Paralabidocera antarctica (Copepoda), Rathkea lizzioides (Anthomedusae) and an un-named cydippid ctenophore. In addition, many holotrichia, at least two species of nematode, a large marine amphipod have been recorded in the benthic community, and tardigrades are present. 
One species of fish, Pagothenia borchgrevinki, has been observed in the lake on one occasion. This species is common in coastal areas and fjords of the Vestfold Hills, although it does not appear to inhabit the lake continuously. Due to the seasonal marine connection, it remains probable that additional algae, zooplankton and fish enter the lake but do not survive the winter.
Mosses and lichens occur in the vicinity of small ephemeral watercourses draining radially down the ‘talus skirt’ fringing the Precambrian hills. Numerous small crevices and cracks in the knoll jutting into the northern end of Burton Lake provide a rich lichen site, while the northern end of Poseidon Lake is rich in mosses. The moss and lichen flora of the Area has not been documented, although the Vestfold Hills supports at least six moss species and at least 23 lichens. 
Several vertebrates occur sporadically within the Area during the summer months between November and February. Two bird species, Wilson's storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) and Snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) nest in the higher Precambrian rocks, while South polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) nest on marine Plain and occasionally around the water’s edge. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli) and Southern Elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) along with Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) also occur in small groups in the Area but have not been specifically studied here.
Meteorological data for the Area are confined almost entirely to observations at Davis station, 10 km northwest of Marine Plain. The Vestfold Hills area has a polar maritime climate that is cold, dry and windy. Summer days are typically sunny, with a midday temperature from -1C to +3C and a summer maximum of +5C, but temperatures are below 0C for most of the year falling to as low as 40.7C in winter. The maximum temperature recorded at Davis station from 1957 to 2001 was +13C. The record illustrates the seasonal climate expected for high latitudes, but on average Davis station is warmer than other Antarctic stations at similar latitudes. This has been attributed to the “rocky oasis” which results from the lower albedo of rock surfaces compared to ice, hence more solar energy is absorbed and re-radiated as heat. 
6.2. Special Zones within the Area
None.
6.3 Location of Structures Within and Adjacent to the Site
There are no refuges within the Area but two refuges are located nearby. Marine Plain Refuge (6836’54”S, 7865’30”E) is approximately 150 m north of the northern boundary of the Area. A helicopter landing site is immediately adjacent to this refuge. Watts Hut (6835’54”S, 7813’48”E) is located at the eastern end of Ellis Fjord, approximately 5 km east-northeast of the Marine Plain Refuge and 2.9 km east-northeast of the northern-most point of the Area. 
A variety of evidence of research activity remains at Marine Plain. Two parallel lines of small boulders mark out a helicopter landing site 30 m north of a fossil site (6837’37”S, 7808’11”E). At this fossil site, a black sheet of polythene (3 m x 1.7 m) held down by rocks is currently covering an excavation site. At the northwestern side of the embayment, there are approximately 10 wooden stakes 1m high in a rough line, north to south. In the next embayment to the north, three red painted rock cairns form a triangle area (of side length approximately 50 m) remaining from field work in 1980.
Within Marine Plain there also remains plastered hessian covering fossil bones; five shallow unfilled pits; a large unfilled pit (near Burton Lake); a major unfilled excavation occurring on one high flank of a natural trough (the trough locally known as “Big Ditch”) and some old filled trench sites.. On the northwestern side of Burton Lake lies a pipe and rope (possibly for lake monitoring).
6.4 Location of Other Protected Areas in the Vicinity
Two Historic Sites and Monuments lay in the Vestfold Hills, at least 25 km north of Marine Plain:
    1. On the largest of the Tryne Islands (68° 18'29”S, 78° 23’44”E) in Tryne Bay (29 km north-east of Davis), HSM No. 72 is a cairn and wooden mast, erected in 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen marking the first landing in the Vestfold Hills area.
    2. Walkabout Rocks Cairn HSM No. 6 (6822’14”S, 7832’19”E) 40 km north-east of Davis, is a rock cairn erected in 1939 by Sir Hubert Wilkins. The cairn contains a canister containing a record of his visit. 
7. Permit Conditions
Entry into the Area is prohibited except in accordance with a Permit issued by an appropriate national authority. Conditions for issuing a Permit to enter the ASPA are that:
    • it is issued only for scientific (palaeontological, palaeoclimatic, geological, geomorphological, glaciological, biological and limnological) research, or for compelling scientific, educational or cultural reasons, or for essential management purposes consistent with the Plan of Management objectives such as inspection, maintenance or review;
    • actions do not jeopardise the ecological or scientific values of the area, or other permitted activities;
    • actions are consistent with the Plan of Management;
    • the Permit (or copy) shall be carried within the ASPA;
    • a visit report shall be supplied to the appropriate national authority within three months of the expiry date of the Permit (see 8.10); and
    • Permits shall be issued for a stated period.
7.1 Access to and Movement within or over the Area 
    • Movement within the ASPA should be kept to a minimum with every reasonable effort made to minimise impact. The brittle surface crust is easily crushed under foot, risking damage to fossil material and long-term evidence of human impact. Where possible, movement on Precambrian areas is preferred, while movement on the scarps is to be avoided. All movement should be undertaken carefully so as to minimise disturbance to the soil, vegetation, diatomite, thermokarst, sediment outcrops and other geofeatures that provide scientific and environmental value to the site; 
    • In order to minimise foot traffic within Marine Plain, a helicopter landing site within the ASPA may be authorised. The landing site shall be:
        ◦ measured against overall usage in keeping with protected area status;
        ◦ on a debris free Precambrian bedrock surface where minimal disturbance can be caused by the aircraft to water bodies, vegetation or sediment deposits; and
        ◦ at a location that will minimise the impact of passage to the intended research site.
    • Motorised boats are not to be used on Burton Lake;
    • Over-flying Burton Lake should be kept to the minimum necessary to achieve specific research or management requirements; and
    • Movement within the ASPA by vehicle is prohibited.
7.2 Activities which are, or may be conducted, within the Area, including restrictions on time and place
The following activities may be conducted within the ASPA throughout the year provided access requirements can be met:
    • compelling scientific research which cannot be undertaken elsewhere and that will not jeopardise the values of the ASPA;
    • sampling, which should be the minimum required for the approved research programs;
    • sampling of Burton Lake, ensuring equipment is washed before entry to the ASPA to prevent contamination from other lakes; and
    • management activities, including monitoring;
7.3 Installation, modification or removal of structures
Any structures erected or installed within the Area are to be specified in a Permit. Permanent structures or installations are prohibited. Scientific markers and equipment must be secured and maintained in good condition, clearly identifying the permitting country, name of principal investigator and year of installation. All such items should be made of materials that pose minimum risk of contamination of the Area. Removal of equipment associated with scientific research before the permit for that research expires, shall be a condition of the permit.. Details of markers and equipment left in situ (GPS locations, description, tags, etc. and expected “use by date”) should be reported to the permitting Authority.
7.4 Location of field camps
Parties should not camp in the Area but use the Marine Plain Refuge (6836’54”S, 786’30”E; see 6.2). 
7.5 Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area
    • No living animals, plant material or micro organisms shall be deliberately introduced into the ASPA and the precautions listed in 8.9 shall be taken against accidental introductions;
    • No herbicides or pesticides shall be brought into the ASPA. Any other chemicals, including radio-nuclides or stable isotopes, authorised for scientific or management purposes, must be removed from the ASPA at or before the conclusion of the activity for which the Permit was granted;
    • Organic material (wood, cotton, hessian, etc.) is not to be used for scientific markers or other research unless absolutely necessary. Inorganic materials (stainless steel, polythene, etc.) are to be used;
    • Fuel is not to be stored in the ASPA unless required for essential purposes connected with the activity for which the Permit has been granted. Fuel must be removed from the ASPA on or before completion of the associated activity. Permanent fuel depots are prohibited;
    • All materials introduced shall be for a stated period only, shall be removed at or before the conclusion of that stated period, and shall be stored and handled so that risk of their introduction to the environment is minimised.
7.6 Taking of or harmful interference with native flora and fauna
The taking of or harmful interference with native flora or fauna is prohibited, except by Permit issued in accordance with Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Where taking or harmful interference with animals is involved, the SCAR Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica should be used as a minimum standard.
7.7 Collection and removal of anything not brought into the Area by the Permit Holder
    • Sample material may be collected or removed from the ASPA only in accordance with a Permit and should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet scientific or management needs;
    • Permits shall not be granted if there is a reasonable concern that the sampling proposed would take, displace, remove or damage such quantities of rock, soil, water, or native flora or fauna that their distribution or abundance at Marine Plain would be significantly affected; and
    • Material of human origin likely to compromise the values of the Area, which was not brought into the Area by the Permit holder or otherwise authorised, may be removed unless the impact of the removal is likely to be greater than leaving the material in situ. In this event, the appropriate national authority must be notified.
7.8 Disposal of waste
All wastes, including all human wastes, shall be removed from the ASPA.

7.9 Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Plan of Management can continue to be met
    • Permits may be granted to enter the ASPA to carry out monitoring and site inspections, which may involve the small-scale collection of samples for analysis or review, or for protective measures;
    • Any specific sites of long-term monitoring shall be appropriately marked;
    • To help maintain the geological, palaeontologic, geomorphological, biological, limnological, and scientific values of Marine Plain, persons shall take special care travelling over slopes, moraines, rock exposures and diatomite soil. To minimise the risk of damage to these values, foot traffic to and from, Marine Plain and the plain south of Poseidon Basin and east of Pickard Ridge, shall be restricted wherever possible;
    • To help maintain the ecological and scientific values derived from the relatively low level of human impact within the ASPA, special precautions shall be taken against introductions. Of particular concern are microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils at other Antarctic sites, including stations, or from regions outside Antarctica. To minimise the risk of introductions, footwear and any equipment to be used in the Area shall be thoroughly cleaned – particularly sampling equipment and markers – before entering the ASPA;
    • The closure and securing of excavation sites during and at the completion of an activity should ensure to the extent reasonably possible, stratigraphic integrity is preserved and endolithic communities are maintained. Recommended measures include the placing of excavated soil on polythene sheet of adequate thickness, the replacing of soil/sediment in layers in the order in which it has been removed, the replacing of larger clasts by correct orientation, the removing of unnatural surface irregularities, and the reorientation of rock and till during closure. 
    • Abandoned scientific equipment shall be removed, and excavations rehabilitated, to the maximum extent possible;
7.10 Requirements for reports
Parties should ensure that the principal Permit Holder for each permit issued submits to the appropriate national authority a report on activities undertaken. Such reports should include, as appropriate, the information identified in the Visit Report form suggested by SCAR. Parties should maintain a record of such activities and, in the Annual Exchange of Information, should provide summary descriptions of activities conducted by persons subject to their jurisdiction, which should be in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the Plan of Management. Parties should, wherever possible, deposit originals or copies of such original reports in a publicly accessible archive to maintain a record of usage, to be both in any review of the Plan of Management and in organising the scientific use of the Area.
