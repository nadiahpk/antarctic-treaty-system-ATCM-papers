Proposed Boundary Change to Specially Protected Area (SPA No. 27)  
Backdoor Bay, Cape Royds, Ross Island  
 
 
Working Paper 
New Zealand 
 
 
 
The revised management plan for Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 1, Cape Royds, 
Ross Island proposed by the United States (Working Paper No. 21), includes a revision to 
the boundary for the Area.  This revision would necessitate a concurrent change to the 
common western boundary of the adjacent Specially Protected Area No. 27.   
 
The boundary change to SPA No. 27 is detailed on Map B which is provided in the 
revised management plan for SSSI No.1 contained in the United States Working Paper 
No. 21.   
 
New Zealand has reviewed the proposed change and, in particular, has consulted with the 
New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust regarding potential impacts on the historic site and 
values of the Area.  All those consulted believe that the proposed boundary change will 
not compromise the values of SPA No. 27 and that it will enhance management of both 
protected areas. 
 
The change will require amendment to Map A and Map B in the management plan for 
SPA No. 27 (as detailed in the revised maps for SSSI No. 1).  A small change is also 
required to Section 6, Description of the Area in the text of the management plan as 
follows: 
 
• West, by a line following the boundary of SSSI No. 1 from the coastline at Arrival 
Bay to a signpost (77°31´12.6"S, 166°10´01.3"E) and then continuing to follow the 
boundary of SSSI No. 1 for 40m in a NE direction. 
• Northwest, by a line extending in a NW direction from the boundary of SSSI No. 1 
and following the shore of a small lake to the NW of Pony Lake and then along a 
gully leading to a point at 77°33´7.5"S 166°10´13"E.  
 
New Zealand recommends that the proposed boundary change for SPA No. 27 be 
approved concurrently with approval of the revised management plan for Cape 
Royds SSSI No. 1.
