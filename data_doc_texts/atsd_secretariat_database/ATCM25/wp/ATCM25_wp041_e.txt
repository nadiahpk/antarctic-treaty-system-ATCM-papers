ANTARCTIC SHIPPING GUIDELINES

Working Paper
Submitted by the United Kingdom


Background

    1. At ATCM XXIV, the UK presented Working Paper (XXIV ATCM/WP26) reporting on the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts that was held in London in April 2000 in accordance with Decision 2 (1999).

    2. At ATCM XXIV some delegations were in favour of continuing to develop the Antarctic Shipping guidelines.  Such an approach would build on the work of the Meeting of Experts, and recognised that the ATCM had already decided separately to develop such guidelines for Antarctica.  However, other delegations expressed the view that it would be preferable to postpone further development of the Antarctic Shipping guidelines until the IMO had completed its work on the Arctic guidelines.  These would then provide a firm basis for development of Antarctic guidelines.

    3. No decisions on how to proceed were taken by ATCM XXIV.  Therefore, to assist the process, the UK offered to consult intersessionally with interested Parties, COMNAP, IAATO and others as appropriate to see how the issue might be progressed (paragraphs 83 to 92 of the Final Report of ATCM XXIV refer).

Intersessional Consultation

    4. Following ATCM XXIV the UK posed a series of questions to COMNAP, regarding the applicability of the IMO Arctic guidelines to Antarctica and whether, in COMNAP’s view, the IMO guidelines would be sufficient to address key shipping issues in Antarctica.

    5. COMNAP helpfully undertook an assessment of the most current draft of IMO’s Arctic shipping guidelines.  The outcome to COMNAP’s deliberations is reported in Information Paper (XXV ATCM / IP40).  Notably, COMNAP has made clear that, in its view, the ATCM should await completion of the IMO (Arctic) document before taking any decision on whether it is appropriate to propose extending the scope of the Arctic guidelines so as to include Antarctica.

IMO Arctic Guidelines

    6. Since the matter was discussed at ATCM XXIV, the IMO has made progress towards concluding the Arctic shipping guidelines.

    7. IMO’S Ship Design and Equipment Sub-Committee (DE), which has been co-ordinating the development of the guidelines, agreed in March 2002, to send a final draft to the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) (that meets in October 2002) and to the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) (which meets in December 2002) for approval and subsequent dissemination as an MSC/MEPC circular.    It is therefore anticipated that the IMO Arctic Shipping Guidelines will be finalised by the end of 2002 (and ahead of ATCM XXVI).  As such the opportunity to modify the existing IMO guidelines so as to address also Antarctica, prior to their adoption by IMO, appears to have been lost.

Antarctic Shipping Guidelines

    8. The UK continues to attach importance to addressing the issue of guidelines for vessels operating in Antarctic waters.  Such an approach would:

    • Address the provisions of Article 10 of Annex IV to the Protocol on the design, construction, manning and equipment of ships engaged in supporting Antarctic operations;
    • Address also the observations of COMNAP that a maritime incident represents the most significant risk to the Antarctic environment (XXIII ATCM / WP16);
    • Establish common minimum standards for vessels operating in Antarctic waters at a time of growth in such activity  - particularly within the maritime tourism sector where a number of vessels are flagged with 3rd Party States.

    9. In relation to this last issue, the UK notes that ATCM XXIII agreed to seek subsequent adoption of the Antarctic Shipping Guidelines by IMO as a means of extending their applicability to members of the IMO that are not ATCPs

    10. However, given the slow progress on this matter to date, and the views expressed by a number of Consultative Parties and COMNAP, it now seems appropriate to await the outcome of IMO’s development of guidelines for ships operating in Arctic ice-covered waters, and then to determine how these may need to be amended to address shipping in Antarctic waters.

    11. That said, the UK would note that such a position was in fact taken by the ATCM in 1998.  At ATCM XXII Parties adopted Resolution 3 (1998) recommending that Consultative Parties provide input to IMO on the draft Polar Shipping Code (as was) as it relates to shipping operations within the Antarctic Treaty Area.

Next Steps

    12. The UK suggests therefore that the matter requires a substantive discussion at ATCM XXVI in 2003.  Key issues that need to be addressed at ATCM XXVI include;

    • Should the finalised IMO Arctic guidelines be extended in order to apply also to shipping in Antarctic waters?
    • If so what changes, or additions need to be made to the guidelines to ensure that they adequately address the Antarctic, and by what means should such an assessment be undertaken?
    • What approaches should the ATCM make to IMO in order to secure IMO’s agreement to amend the Arctic guidelines so as to apply also to Antarctica?

NB: It should be noted that the net effect of decisions taken in 1999 which resulted in Antarctica being excluded from the application of the Polar Shipping Code (as was), has been a delay in achieving any meaningful progress.  It is thus likely that any modifications to the guidelines adopted by IMO (so as to address also Antarctica) may take several more years to achieve.




Summary

    13. A summary of the history and background to this issue is attached at Annex A.  This modifies slightly the parallel Annex to COMNAP’s Information Paper (XXV ATCM / IP40), which does not fully record the events and key decisions taken with the IMO and the ATCM during 1999.
Annex A: History and Background

    • In 1991, shortly after the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill in Alaska and the grounding and sinking of the BAHIA PARAISO in Antarctica, there was a meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Marine Safety Committee (MSC).

    • At the 59th session of MSC, Germany introduced a short paper that discussed “Requirements for ships intended for Polar waters”.  Germany suggested that the following simple rule might be included in SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea), Chapter II-1:

“Ships intended for service in Polar Waters should have suitable ice strengthening for Polar conditions in accordance with the rules of a recognized classification society.”

    • MSC 59 referred this matter to the Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Equipment (DE).

    • DE, in turn, agreed to allow an Outside Correspondence Group, to develop proposed Guidance for Ships Operating in Polar Waters.  This Outside Working Group operated outside of the cognizance of IMO.

    • The result of the effort of the Outside Correspondence Group was a substantial draft document called “The Polar Code” that proposed to establish a broad set of new rules for ships operating in the Polar Regions.  The draft Polar Code was submitted to DE 41 in 1998. 

    • DE 41 decided to disseminate the draft Polar Code to IMO’s technical sub-committee’s for further review.

    • ATCM XXII (Tromso, 1998) concluded that the Polar Code as drafted failed adequately to account for the special conditions of the Antarctic.  ATCPs were encouraged to contact their national representatives to the IMO and express their concerns (Resolution 3 (1998) refers).

    • In May 1999, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC 71), further reviewed the draft Polar Code and, following the concerns of a number of member countries, decided to:

    • Further develop the “code” as non-mandatory guidelines;
    • Apply the guidelines only to SOLAS vessels (i.e. ships on international voyages; larger than 500 grt etc);
    • Apply the guidelines only to “ice covered waters” north of 60N;
    • Exclude Antarctica from the area of application of the guidelines unless Antarctic Treaty members decide otherwise;
    • Ensure that the guidelines only contain provisions that are not already covered by other instruments such as SOLAS and MARPOL;
    • Remove inconsistencies between the document and other international conventions (in particular, UNCLOS).

    • ATCM XXIII (Lima, 1999 – which met immediately following IMO’s MSC 71 meeting), concurred with IMO’s decision to exclude Antarctica from the guidelines under development by IMO and decided separately to:

    1. Give priority to the development of guidelines for Antarctic shipping and related activities pursuant to Article 10 of Annex IV of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty;
    2. Seek subsequent adoption of these guidelines by IMO as a means of extending their applicability to members of IMO that are not Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties;
    3. Convene a Meeting of Experts under the provisions of Recommendation IV-24, with the aim of developing draft guidelines for Antarctic shipping and related activities (Decision 2 (1998) refers).

    • The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts was held in London, April 2000.  Following a three-day meeting a series of recommendations were agreed and submitted to ATCM XXIV.

    • At ATCM XXIV (St Petersburg, 2002) the Consultative Parties considered the recommendations put forward by the Meeting of Experts, but made little further progress on the issue.  However, the UK offered to consult intersessionally with interested Parties, COMNAP, IAATO and others as appropriate, to see how the issue of Antarctic shipping guidelines might be progressed.

    • IMO’s Arctic Guidelines are still in draft form and are presently undergoing further IMO review.  If the review proceeds without further delay it is likely that the Guidelines will become final in December 2002.

(Aside:  There is a parallel effort underway that will also effect the design of ships operating in Polar waters.  The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) (an independent body, not a part of the IMO) is developing unified requirements that will “Harmonize” the various classification society rules  (ABS, Germanischer Lloyd, DNV, Canadian ASPPR, Russian Maritime Register of Shipping, etc.).  This is expected to be a worthwhile engineering effort and, once completed, complimentary to anything that IMO would develop).
