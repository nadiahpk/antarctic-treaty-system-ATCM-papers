REPORT OF CCAMLR TO ATCM XXV

1.	Introduction
1.1	In accordance with the regular overview of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) conducted under ATCM Recommendation XIII-2, CCAMLR is pleased to report on various developments since ATCM-XXIV.
1.2	The 7th April 2002 was the Twentieth Anniversary of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources’ entry into force.  This anniversary was celebrated at CCAMLR-XX held in Hobart between 22 October and 2 November 2001.

1.3	CCAMLR-XX adopted a statement to commemorate the Commission’s twenty-year existence (Attachment I). This statement highlights a significant landmark in a process, originally initiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) which is aimed at the comprehensive and systematic protection of the Antarctic environment, as well as dependent and associated ecosystems, from harmful human interference. Through its conscientious and persistent efforts, CCAMLR has developed a practical and efficient regime. With its high standards of internal organization and significant achievements, it is an exemplary instrument of ecosystem protection in general, and of marine living resource conservation in particular.  
1.4	In 2000/2001, CCAMLR addressed a wide range of issues, most notably :
•	Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in the Convention Area;
•	Implementation of the Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp.;
•	Co-Operation with Non-Contracting Parties;
•	Status of fisheries in 2000/01 and evaluation of fisheries for 2001/02;
•	Further development of an integrated fisheries management framework;
•	Initiatives concerning development of ecosystem management  approaches;
•	Further work on the elimination of seabird by-catch in longline fisheries;
•	Co-Operation with the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) and other bodies, and
•	Monitoring of marine debris and their impact on Antarctic animals.


2.	CCAMLR Membership

2.1	CCAMLR’s membership currently stands at 24 countries with an additional seven States being party to the Convention, but not Members of the Commission.

2.2	Namibia became a full Member on 5 February 2001 and Vanuatu acceded to the Convention on 20 June 2001.


3.	Fisheries in 2000/2001
3.1	Fisheries in the CCAMLR Convention Area during 2000/01 targeted Patagonian and Antarctic Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and krill (Euphausia superba). There was only limited fishing for squid and no fishing of crabs.
3.2 	The reported catch of finfish was  12 998 tonnes in 2000/01, compared to 19 283 tonnes in 1999/2000.  Dissostichus spp. accounted for 10 619 tonnes of catch, compared to 14 441tonnes in the previous season.  It is believed that, in addition to the reported catches of Toothfish, about 7 600 tonnes were taken by illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing.
 
3.3	The reported catch of krill was 98 414 tonnes in 2000/01, compared to 114 425 tonnes in the previous season. The annual krill catch has remained relatively stable since 1992/93, ranging from about 80 000 to 120 000 tonnes.
 3.4	The Commission continues to receive notifications from Member States intending to conduct new and exploratory fisheries. In the 2000/01 season, it should be noted that only a very notifications were activated. For the forthcoming season,  some 11 out of a total of 28 new Conservation Measures adopted at CCAMLR-XIX deal directly with exploratory fisheries in 2001/02.
3.5	The Conservation Measures adopted at CCAMLR-XX address all fisheries to be conducted in the Convention Area during the 2001/02 season. They also include general measures for regulating fishing activities and reporting fisheries information from the Area.
3.6	CCAMLR-XX adopted four Measures and six Resolutions to promote compliance with CCAMLR Conservation Measures (by both Contracting and non-Contracting Parties) and to improve implementation of the Toothfish Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS).
3.7	The Conservation Measures and Resolutions for 2001/02 are published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force, 2001/02.
3.8	Other fisheries for Patagonian Toothfish (D. eleginoides) took place within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of France (CCAMLR Subarea 58.6 and Division 58.5.1) and of South Africa (Subareas 58.6 and 58.7).

4. 	Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Fishing in the Convention Area
4.1	The IUU fishery for Toothfish (especially Patagonian Toothfish) in the Convention Area, as well as in closely adjacent areas, has been a major discussion item for CCAMLR for the past five years (1997–2001). The Commission considers information submitted by Members to evaluate IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area. This includes reports on sightings and on apprehension of IUU fishing vessels, factual data on sightings of vessels by scientific observers, port inspections of vessels and instances of fraudulent use of Toothfish catch documents under the CDS.
4.2	The estimated IUU catch in the Convention Area in 2000/01 was 7 599 tonnes, compared with 6 546 tonnes in 1999/00 and 4 913 tonnes in 1998/99. Catches of Patagonian Toothfish  have also been reported via the CDS from areas adjacent to, and to the north of, the Convention Area. The level of reported catches from just outside the Convention Area in FAO Statistical Area 51 (Indian Ocean) may not be credible. In the light of this uncertainty, CCAMLR is faced with determining what proportion of the catches reported from Area 51 actually originate from that area, or are a product of IUU fishing inside the Convention Area.
4.3	Although there has been a noticeable reduction in IUU fishing in the Convention Area, CCAMLR continues to afford the matter high priority since it profoundly compromises the Convention’s primary objectives. In the light of information received in 2001, the Commission reinforced its integrated administrative and political measures aimed at eliminating IUU fishing in the Convention Area. In particular, it agreed:

    • Revised reporting Members' requirements on fishing licenses issued and on VMS-derived information fro vessels crossing Area/Subarea/Division boundaries within the Convention Area;

    • A resolution on the use of VMS in the verification of catch locations reported under the CDS for areas to the north of the Convention Area, particularly Area 51; 

    • A scheme to promote compliance by non-Contracting Party vessels with CCAMLR Conservation Measures;

    • Maintenance of a list of Flags of Convenience along with the development of a consistent process to identify such flags;

    • Information exchange with the Lloyd's Vessel Register for vessels known to be engaged in IUU fishing activities; and

    • Clarification of various CDS provisions and related documents.

4.4	In addition to ongoing implementation of the CDS (see Section 5 below), CCAMLR has adopted Conservation Measures aimed at improving enforcement of, and compliance with, the organization’s management initiatives. These measures comprise a regime to establish co-operation between Parties to improve compliance, inspections by Contracting Parties of vessels licensed to fish in the Convention Area, inspections of non-Contracting Party fishing vessels in the ports of Contracting Parties, compulsory identification marking of vessels and fishing gear, further development of ties with non-Contracting Parties, and introduction of a vessel monitoring system for most Toothfish fisheries. Specifically, they include:
•	The CCAMLR System of Inspection:
•	Scheme to Promote Compliance by Non-Contracting Party Vessels with CCAMLR Conservation Measures (Conservation Measure 118/XX);
•	Licensing and Inspection Obligations of Contracting Parties with regard to their Flag Vessels Operating in the Convention Area (Conservation Measure 119/XX);
•	Marking of Fishing Vessels and Fishing Gear (Conservation Measure 146/XVII);
•	Provisions to ensure Compliance with CCAMLR Conservation Measures by Vessels, including Cooperation between Contracting Parties (Conservation Measure 147/XIX); 
•	Automated Satellite-Linked Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) (Conservation Measure 148/XX);
•	Prohibition of Directed Fishing for Dissostichus spp. except in accordance with specific Conservation Measures (Conservation Measure 146/XX);
•	Harvesting of Stocks Occurring both Within and Outside the Convention Area (Resolution 10/XII);
•	Flagging and Licensing of Non-Contracting Party Vessels (Resolution 13/XIX);
•	Catch Documentation Scheme: Implementation by Acceding States and Non-Contracting Parties (Resolution 14/XIX);
•	Catch Documentation Scheme: Implementation by Acceding States and Non-Contracting Parties (Resolution 14/XIX);
•	Use of Ports not Implementing the Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp. (Resolution 15/XIX), and
•	Use of VMS and other Measures for the Verification of CDS Catch Data for Areas Outside the Convention Area, in particular, FAO Statistical Area 51 (Resolution 17/XX).
4.5	Pursuant to Articles 19 to 23 of the 1995 United Nations Implementing Agreement for Highly Migratory Stocks and Straddling Stocks  (UNIA)(which entered into force in December 2001), the Commission maintains a vessel database to facilitate the exchange of information between CCAMLR Members on vessels known to have fished in contravention of CCAMLR Conservation Measures. It has also agreed to compile a list of Flags of Convenience and to develop a consistent procedure to identify such flags.
4.6	CCAMLR continues to encourage Members to ratify, and promote the entry into force of, such international instruments as UNIA, the 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. It has also noted the importance of the recent (February 2001) FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). The IPOA-IUU should constitute a useful tool in efforts to address IUU fishing in the Convention Area. The Commission has encouraged all its Members to participate in the IPOA-IUU to ensure development of a comprehensive, integrated and global approach to combat IUU fishing. 

5.	CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp.
5.1	The adoption and implementation of the CDS is by far the most important step taken by CCAMLR on IUU fishing in the Convention Area.  The Scheme is designed to track landings and trade flow of Toothfish caught in the Area and, where possible, adjacent waters.  This will enable the Commission to identify the origin of Toothfish entering the markets of all Parties to the Scheme, and will help determine whether Toothfish taken in the Convention Area are caught in a manner consistent with CCAMLR’s Conservation Measures. 
5.2	The CDS (as contained in Conservation Measures 170/XVIII and, as amended, in Conservation Measure 170/XIX and 170/XX) became binding upon all CCAMLR Members on 7 May 2000.
5.3	The current CDS-related measures comprise:

    • Explanatory Memorandum on the Introduction of the Catch Documentation Scheme for Toothfish (Dissostichus spp.);

    • Policy to Enhance Cooperation between CCAMLR and Non-Contracting Parties;

    •  Resolution 14/XIX ‘Catch Documentation Scheme: Implementation by Acceding States and Non-Contracting Parties’;

    • Resolution 15/XIX ‘Use of Ports not implementing the Catch Documentation Scheme for Dissostichus spp.’;

    • Resolution 16/XIX ‘Application of VMS in the Catch Documentation Scheme’; and

    • Resolution 17/XX ‘Use of VMS and other measures for the verification of CDS catch data for areas outside the Convention Area, in particular, in FAO Statistical Area 51’.

5.4	As of October 2001, the total number of catch, export and re-export documents received by the Secretariat under the CDS stood at 8 213. This figure can be broken down into 3 062 documents in respect of each landing/transshipment; 4 884 documents reporting individual exports and 267 re-export documents.  Catch documents have been issued to a total of 433 vessels, excluding the Chilean artisanal fleet.

        5.5 The Commission has noted the CDS’s positive impact in reducing IUU fishing. It provides new/valuable data and information to CCAMLR. This information has helped identify fraudulent catch documents and has resulted in several seizures, and confiscations, of possible IUU products.

        5.6 CCAMLR has formalized a procedure to administer the CDS Fund established last year. A number of projects to improve the CDS’s operation have been  identified.

5.7	Several CCAMLR Non-Contracting Parties engaged in Toothfish fishing and/or trading have been invited to cooperate with CCAMLR in implementation of the CDS. The Republic of Namibia has recently become a Member of the Commission.  The Republic of Seychelles, the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China have joined CCAMLR in implementation of the CDS.  The Republic of Mauritius introduced certain elements of the CDS on 1 January 2001. The Commission continues to encourage Mauritius to fully implement the CDS and become a Party to the Convention. 

5.8	The Commission has noted that Toothfish is being traded through Canada, a CCAMLR Contracting Party. Although Canada has not yet implemented CDS, the Commission has urged that it do so. 

5.9	CCAMLR has ongoing contact with a number of Non-Contracting Parties still not cooperating with CCAMLR in CDS implementation. In particular, contact has recently been made with Kenya, Madagascar and Mozambique, whose ports have been used to offload Toothfish.

5.10	A special CDS working group, established in 2000, continues its work during 2001/02. This group has focused on developing a paperless, web-based, electronic CDS system. This should provide much-needed secure facilities for real-time verification of Catch Documents at all stages in the Toothfish trade cycle.
6.	Fisheries Management
6.1	CCAMLR has made substantial progress in developing a unified framework to underpin management advice on all fisheries in the Convention Area, including the preparation of fishery plans for krill in Area 48 and icefish. An important aim of this framework is to streamline annual review of CCAMLR fisheries by the Scientific Committee and its working groups.  Future development of the framework includes generalizing the notification process, research and fishery operation plans and data collection procedures.

6.2	It has been recognized that the Commission’s work may be simplified by using standard texts for Conservation Measures during their drafting. Where possible, he Commission has agreed to standardize the format of conservation measures dealing with fisheries directly. A revised format for such measures has been adopted, recognizing that there is still a need for flexibility to include non-standard approaches and diverse opinions where agreement on the substance of measures is not possible.


7.	CCAMLR Scheme of International Scientific Observation

7.1	In the 2000/01 season, 60 fishing voyages in the Convention Area were observed by CCAMLR-designated international scientific observers, or national observers, from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, UK and Uruguay.  Scientific observers provided 100% coverage of all CCAMLR fisheries targeting finfish and M. hyadesi, as well as partial coverage of the krill fishery.
8.	Assessment and Avoidance of Seabird Incidental Mortality During Fishing

8.1	Over the past few years CCAMLR has played a leading role in international efforts to reduce seabird mortality in longline fisheries. Conservation Measure 29/XIX (first adopted in 1992 and then periodically revised) outlines procedures to be taken in mitigating such mortality.  All of these procedures have been included in the FAO International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds). 

8.2	CCAMLR’s efforts have achieved much in addressing the problem within the regulated fisheries in the Convention Area. However, mortality of seabirds resulting from IUU fishing in the Convention Area remains undocumented and poses a serious concern. A concerted international effort is required to solve the problem.

8.3	The Commission has noted that overall compliance with Conservation Measure 29/XIX improved in 2000/2001 compared with the previous year. In 2001,  CCAMLR-regulated longline fisheries in the Convention Area continued to exhibit a minimal incidence of seabird by-catch in Subarea 48.3 (0.0014 birds/thousand hooks), a significant  improvement in the South African EEZ in Subareas 58.6 and 58.7 (a 61% reduction over 199/2000) and no incidental mortality in Subarea 88.1 for the fourth successive year.

8.4	Nevertheless, some vessels are still failing to comply with all elements of the Conservation Measures 29/XIX. Taking this into account, the Commission has stated that vessels equipped or configured so that they are unable to comply with the Measure should be prohibited from fishing in the Convention Area.

8.5	CCAMLR’s efforts to reduce seabird by-catch in longline fisheries in the immediate future include:

    • Continuing compulsory placement of international and national scientific observers on board all longline vessels fishing in the Convention Area;

    • Ensuring full compliance with existing CCAMLR mitigation procedures under Conservation Measure 29/XIX;

    • Conducting rigorous experiments on the effects of different elements of Conservation Measure 29/XIX for the Spanish longline system;

    • Conducting further field trials in order to define a line-weighting regime for autoliners to be incorporated in Conservation Measure 29/XIX; and

    • Continuing development of underwater longline setting gear and methods. 

8.6	CCAMLR exchanges information with a number of international fisheries and conservation organizations striving to prevent incidental mortality of seabirds during fishing operations, on the state of Antarctic seabird populations affected by longline fisheries, incidental catches of seabirds in fisheries, and on CCAMLR’s experience with mitigating techniques and with the consequent formulation of conservation measures.

8.7	CCAMLR Members participated actively in the development of a Regional Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). This Agreement was open for signature on 19 June 2001. It is expected that the Agreement will come into force in 2002.


9.	Ecosystem Monitoring and Management

9.1	Progress has been made in a number of areas. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that a substantial change may have occurred in the krill-based system’s dynamics, most noticeably in terms of environmental conditions prevailing in Subareas 48.1 and 48.3.  

9.2	Appropriate fishery-management frameworks are under development by CCAMLR to account for long-term changes in functional relationships between krill and its predators. Further work is being directed at: 

    • Defining small-scale management units, such as predator units;

    • Reviewing the utility of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP); 

    • Further developing prey–predator–fishery–environment models for use in the management of the krill fishery.

A timeline for development of krill management procedure has been established.

 
10.	Monitoring Marine Debris and its Impact on Marine Animals

10.1	CCAMLR annually reviews the marine debris issue. It has implemented a suite of measures to monitor and evaluate the impact of anthropogenic debris and waste on marine living resources in the Convention Area. At present, these include:

    • Reporting by fishing vessels of lost or discarded fishing gear;

    • Periodic surveys of marine debris on beaches and in seal and penguin colonies near coastal stations;

    • Reporting accidental entanglement(s) in, or ingestion of, marine debris by birds, marine mammals, fish, and other animals; and

    • Recording observations of marine mammals and seabirds soiled with hydrocarbons such as fuel oil.



11.	Co-Operation with the Antarctic Treaty System & Other International Organizations

11.1	CCAMLR subscribes to the view that links between CCAMLR and the ATCM, particularly in respect of the Madrid Protocol, constitute a unique system of environmental protection for the Antarctic as a whole.

11.2	In accordance with Article 6(2) of Annex V of the Protocol, no marine area can be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASMA) or Specially Managed Area (ASMA) without CCAMLR’s approval. Since Annex V is not yet in force, no proposals for marine areas have been formally submitted by the ATCM to CCAMLR for consideration. CCAMLR-XX confirmed that consideration of such proposals should be based on, but not limited exclusively by: 

    (i) Whether a site proposed for designation as a marine protected area affects actual or potential harvesting of marine resources in relation to Article II of the Convention, and

    (ii) Whether the draft management plan for the proposed site might prevent or restrict CCAMLR-related activities.
 
It was recognized that the range of issues to be addressed by CCAMLR may vary, depending on the type of proposal(s) under consideration.

11.3	CCAMLR-XX also agreed on procedures to process proposals from the ATCM so that the necessary review can be undertaken within one calendar year of receipt. In this connection, it has agreed to:

    •  Strengthen cooperation with the ATCM and CEP, especially on issues such as monitoring and protection of the environment, preparation of the State of the Antarctic Environment Report (SAER), protected species and areas, environmental pollution and other common responsibilities; 

    • Maintain contact with the ATCM Secretariat, once established, and provide it with assistance as required;

    • Co-ordinate activities relevant to the Protocol’s implementation and, in particular, in respect of its Article 8. One of CCAMLR’s key concerns relates to the issue of whether a Party to the Protocol has a right to require activities by another Party falling within CCAMLR’s competence to be subject to an environmental impact assessment; and

    • Maintain CCAMLR’s distinct identity and responsibility in light of potential overlaps in competence between CCAMLR and the ATCM, especially taking into account that not all Members of CCAMLR are now parties to the Antarctic Treaty or Protocol.

11.4	Various tasks were identified for those Members representing CCAMLR at meetings of other international organizations in 2001/02 and a schedule of such attendance was drawn up.

    12. Future Work
12.1	On the anniversary of its twentieth year, CCAMLR’s reaffirmed that its future work will focus on:

    • Enhancing the effectiveness of CCAMLR’s multilateral nature and expanding, if appropriate, current co-operation with conservation initiatives in areas adjacent to the Convention Area; 

    • Continuing close cooperation with other ATS instruments, as well as other agreements applicable to the Convention Area;

    • Developing a more extensive network of international contacts among fisheries and other relevant organizations; and

    • Increasing efforts to preserve the Antarctic marine ecosystem, so as to contribute to ecological “health”, the sustainable use of marine living resources and, in particular, for the benefit of future generations.
ATTACHMENT I
STATEMENT BY CCAMLR-XX ON THE COMMEMORATION 
OF 20 YEARS OF CCAMLR
The seventh of April 2002 will be the 20th Anniversary of the entery into force of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which was adopted in Canberra (Australia) in 1980.  This anniversary is a landmark in the process, initiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, of comprehensive and systematic protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems from harmful human interference.  With the entry into force of the Madrid Protocol and its Committee for Environmental Protection, and the decision to establish the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty in Buenos Aires, cooperation among all the components of the Antarctic Treaty System will be strengthened. With Namibia recently becoming a Member of the Commission and Vanuatu acceding, the Convention unites 31 Parties with interests in its area of application, all of whom celebrate with well-founded pride and optimism these first two decades of the organization’s existence.
Indeed, through its conscientious and persistent efforts, CCAMLR has developed a practical and efficient regime for the protection and preservation of Antarctica’s marine living resources. The aim of this international instrument is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, a concept which includes their rational use. The rigorous application of the CCAMLR Conservation Principles enshrined in Article II set the Convention apart from other marine resources regimes. In its broader context, this approach requires that the management of fisheries should take into account the effects of human activity on the living organisms of the Antarctic ecosystems and sub-ecosystems. It also requires that such management be consistent with the precautionary approach, which takes account of circumstances of biological uncertainty.
In accordance with this conservation-oriented and precautionary approach, the Convention provides for the mechanisms necessary to enforce its underlying principles, such as a Commission which adopts each year a series of measures and governs their enforcement; a Scientific Committee as a consultative body responsible for providing essential information, conducting scientific assessments and recommending appropriate measures; and a system of observation and inspection aimed at promoting the objective of the Convention and ensuring compliance with its provisions. CCAMLR, with its high standards of internal organization and its significant achievements, is an exemplary instrument of ecosystem protection. Over the past 20 years, it has established a comprehensive code of responsibility for its Member countries through the adoption and implementation of over 200 conservation measures.
The illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing of Dissostichus spp., or toothfish, is one of the greatest challenges the Commission has had to face.  In recent years, the catch rate of IUU fishing has been more than double that of the regulated fisheries, causing a significant decline of the toothfish populations in certain areas and depleting populations of seabirds, especially albatrosses and petrels which are caught incidentally in the longline fisheries.  The firm commitment of the Members of the Commission to combat this problem has resulted in the adoption of a series of measures to enforce a stricter control.  Of these, the most important has been the introduction of the Catch Documentation System for Dissostichus spp., which aims to ensure that the international trade of these species is consistent with CCAMLR’s aims and conservation measures. This system represents a major step forward in the implementation of the objective of CCAMLR and shows the commitment of Contracting Parties towards the conservation and protection of the environment, consolidating the effectiveness of CCAMLR, its credibility as an organization within the international community and its leadership in the management of marine living resources.
Having noted the important achievements of this Convention, it is now appropriate to focus on its future work and other challenges arising worldwide. Among these, and giving due consideration to UNCLOS, is the need to develop a more extensive network of international contacts among fisheries organizations and, if appropriate, particularly those with competence over marine living resources in areas bordering that of the CCAMLR Convention.  It is also necessary to continue to develop cooperation with other relevant organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization etc., and to take duly into consideration the effects of the implementation of the other instruments of the Antarctic Treaty System, as well as other agreements applicable to the Convention Area. There is a need to ensure the effectiveness of the multilateral system of the CCAMLR and expand, if appropriate, the cooperation on conservation on areas adjacent to the Convention Area. 
Finally, conscious of what needs to be done in the future and in appreciation of what has already been achieved, we, the Member countries gathered in Hobart in October 2001 to celebrate the Twentieth Meetings of the Commission and Scientific Committee of CCAMLR, commit ourselves to redouble our efforts to make certain that the marine ecosystems surrounding the Antarctic continent are preserved so as to contribute to the overall ecological equilibrium, to the sustainable use of marine living resources and, in particular, for the benefit of future generations.
Therefore, we commit ourselves to continue developing and perfecting the achievement of CCAMLR’s objectives.
