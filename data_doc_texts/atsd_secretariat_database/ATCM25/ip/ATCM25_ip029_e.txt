REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE 
MEETING XXV BY THE DEPOSITARY GOVERNMENT FOR THE 
CONVENTION FOR CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC SEALS (UNITED 
KINGDOM) IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECOMMENDATION XIII-2, 
PARAGRAPH 2(d) 
 
 
 
1. This report covers events regarding the Convention for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Seals (CCAS) for the reporting years 1 March 2000 to 28 February 2001 
and 1 March 2001 to 29 February 2002. As the Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meeting XXV is being held after the close of the 2002 reporting period it has been 
possible to report for two consecutive years. Events prior to 1 March 2000 were 
reported to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII 
XXIII and XXIV (see respective Annexes in each report). 
 
2. The annual reports required by Article 5 (Capture and Killing of Seals) of the 
Convention are reproduced as Annex A and Annex B to this report. 
 
3. The United Kingdom would like to remind Contracting Parties that the reporting 
period for the Exchange of Information is from 1 March to end of February each 
year. The reporting period was changed to the above dates during the September 
1988 Meeting to Review the Operation of the Convention. This is documented in 
Paragraph 19(a) of the Report of that Meeting.  
 
4. The Exchange of Information, referred to in Paragraph 6(a) in the Annex to the 
Convention, should be submitted to other Contracting Parties and to SCAR by 30 
June each year, including nil returns. Currently not all the information required in 
paragraph 6(a) is being provided. Neither is it being provided on time or with any 
regularity. The accuracy of the CCAS figures is therefore being compromised. 
 
5. Since the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXIII there have been no 
accessions to CCAS. A list of countries which were original signatories to the 
Convention, and countries which have subsequently acceded, is attached (Annex 
C) to this report.
