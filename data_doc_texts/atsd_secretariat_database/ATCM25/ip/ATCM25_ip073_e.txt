				IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism

The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2001-2002 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. Additional information can be found on line at www.iaato.org, including the statistics compiled annually by the Office of Polar Programs at the United States National Science Foundation.

1	Overview

In 2001-2002 it is estimated that 11, 588 tourists landed in the Antarctic on private sector sea borne and or land based expeditions. Tourist activities included small boat or zodiac cruising, shore landings, and to a lesser extent kayaking, mountain climbing, scuba diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, parachuting, marathon running, helicopter and Argo expeditions. A brief summary of the season, "IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism, 2001-2002,” is appended (Appendix A). Of these Antarctic visitors, 

    • 159 participated in land-based expeditions (IAATO member), 
    • 8073 traveled aboard commercially organized IAATO member vessels, 
    • 2029 traveled on board IAATO member large cruise vessel and did not land 
    • 2,893 traveled aboard one non-member vessel and landed tourists in the Antarctic Peninsula
    • Approximately 142 traveled aboard non-IAATO member yachts or sailing vessels

One large cruise ship carried a total of 2029 tourists and operated two voyages to Antarctica but did not land tourists.

All tour IAATO member and non-IAATO member companies have submitted Initial Environmental Impact Assessments (IEE’s).

All commercial tour companies are located in Contracting Party States.  In the past there were only two companies, one of which is no longer in existence that was located in Canada. Both Canadian companies have submitted IEE’s in the past and have followed existing Antarctic Treaty and in most cases exceeded the domestic requirements

2	Seaborne Tourism

2.1	11,429 tourists landed in the Antarctic on 19 commercially organized tour vessels plus sailing vessels and or yachts from November 2001 to March 2002, representing a 6.7% decrease over the 2000-2001-season total of 12,248 ship-based visitors.  For the last two year 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 sea borne tourism with landings have actually decreased since the millennium peak. 
	
	One large cruise vessel visited Antarctica twice for a 72 hour time period each time and carried 2029 tourists to the Antarctic Peninsula.

	Overall numbers have been separated noting the diversification of activities.

        2.2 IAATO members operated all but one of the Antarctic tour vessels that sailed in 2001 – 2002. The non-IAATO vessel Marco Polo (Orient Lines is the parent company) has been operating in Antarctica since 1993. (IAATO’s Bylaws state that vessels carrying more than 500 passengers cannot land and that stringent landing restrictions could be placed on vessels over 200 passengers at specific landing sites if necessary due to environmental considerations. Marco Polo plans to carry more than 500 passengers.)

        2.3 The vast majority of Antarctic voyages are to the Peninsula region during the five-month Austral summer season (November – March), departing from Ushuaia, Argentina, or, to a lesser extent, from Punta Arenas, Chile or Port Stanley, Falkland Islands. Of approximately 137 ship and yacht voyages during the 2001-2002 season, 111 voyages visited the Antarctic Peninsula region; 6 visited the Ross Sea/Continental area.  A breakdown of the tourist activities follows.

        2.4 Region visited		Activity	Number of 		    Number of

        Two IAATO member sailing vessels include the Pelagic and Sir Hubert Wilkins.

    3 Commercial Antarctic Sailing Vessels and or Yachts (non-IAATO members)

3.1	Based on information received by the IAATO Secretariat, a total of 142 passengers were reported to have traveled to Antarctica aboard 18 non-IAATO commercial sailing vessels and or yachts in the 2001-2002 season. This information is compiled at Arthur Harbor by U.S. National Science Foundation staff, and by information provided to IAATO by the British Antarctic Survey staff at Port Lockroy. Sailing vessel/yacht activity information (which may be incomplete) is included in the statistical summaries and projections appended to this report, or listed on the IAATO website. IAATO has three yacht members who operate the following sailing vessels: S/Y Pelagic, S/Y Golden Fleece and Sir Hubert Wilkins. Antarctic sailing vessel/yacht activity is also compiled annually by Robert Headland at Scott Polar Research Institute (University of Cambridge, England) as part of the ongoing “Chronological List of Antarctic Expeditions and Related Historical Events.” IAATO member Golden Fleece operated in South Georgia and the Falkland Islands this season.

3.2	Regular Commercial yachts with fare paying passengers include the Pelagic (IAATO Member, Pelagic Expeditions), and Sir Hubert Wilkins (IAATO Member, Ocean Frontiers).   Others (non-IAATO members) are listed in the table “Overview of Non-IAATO Member Yachts, 2001-02.”  

            3.2.1 The IAATO Secretariat is in correspondence with some of the non-member sailing vessels. Antarctic Treaty parties permitting sailing vessel/yacht operations should encourage the use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO would like to request copies whenever possible of all Post Visit Site reports for non-member companies so that tourism data can be compiled on landing sites and overall numbers. This will also further assist in being able to compile data for use in furthering the understanding of potential cumulative impacts.

Several commercial sailing vessels/operators have approached IAATO in July 2002 and are interested in membership. 
	
Discussions are also taking place concerning an amendment to the standard Post Visit Site Report form that would be more usable and would most likely reflect sailing vessel activities.  IAATO has compiled a complete list of companies that operated during the 2001-2002 season so that national programs who are overseeing yacht activities from their respective countries assure that the Environmental Protocol requirements have been met.

4	Land-based Tourism--Adventure Network International
	
        4.1 IAATO member Adventure Network International (ANI) operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the sixteenth consecutive season. ANI carried a total of 159 land-based tourists, which included support services for private expeditions, and ANI-organized and operated expeditions.  ANI also continues to provide Emergency Medical Evacuation Response (EMER) to IAATO member vessels throughout the period that the tourist vessels are operating in the Peninsula region. ANI’s operations include the following:

        4.2 Aircraft Operations  
    • One Ilyushin-76 for cargo and fuel and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills for a total of 14 flights, 7 tourists and 7 fuel flights. 
    • ANI did not operate a Hercules aircraft in the interior of Antarctica 
    • One Twin Otter aircraft, also ski equipped was used for interior flights through the end of the Antarctic season 
    •  One Cessna 185 on skis was also used for interior flying.

        4.3 Patriot Hills Camp opened 23 November 2001 and closed January 31, 2002. 

4.4	ANI provided support for the following private expeditions: 
    • Planetary Studies Meteorite Expedition
    • The Poles Wearables Expedition (2x Swedish)

5	Overflights

Air Operations-Flight Seeing

5.1	During the 2001-2002 season, Croydon Travel of Victoria Australia operated six 
Antarctica day sightseeing flights from Australia - Melbourne (2), Sydney 
(3) and Adelaide (1) aboard a Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the 
8th consecutive season.

A total of 2082 tourists participated in six flights from November 2001 to February 2002 . In addition, the aircraft carried a total of 132 crew during the season. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 64 flights carrying over 22,000 tourists since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The aircraft operate at a minimum altitude of 10,000 ft or 2,000 ft above the highest ground within 100 nautical miles. The flights operate mainly to the northern Victoria Land coast, Oates, George V and Adélie Land regions. The pilots avoid any known penguin colonies by a horizontal separation of one mile and provide a full in-flight lecture and education program utilising at least three Antarctic lecturers and at least six videos.

A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground to air interviews
are conducted with staff members at Australian and sometimes Italian bases. This season
provided some of the clearest viewing conditions on record.
 
Croydon Travel expects to operate at least three flights during the 2002-2003 season to the same areas detailed from Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. 

5.2 	Numerous flights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate from Punta Arenas, Chile but information on these flights has been difficult to obtain.  According to IAATO sources, overflights of the Antarctic Peninsula from Punta Arenas, Chile, operate frequently from November to March, by two companies, Lan Chile and DAP. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers and independent travelers calling at Punta Arenas. Specific information is not forthcoming by either of the airlines despite numerous attempts by IAATO and other interested parties. 

The flying routes vary according to weather conditions but basically are as follows:
    • King George Island, Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and 
Deception Island (South Shetland Islands).
    • King George Island and Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell
Sea in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands.

6	Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2002-2003 Season
	
Appendix B illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that will occur during the 2002-2003 season. This is an estimate based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat. Note that most all the activities listed have occurred in the past 10 years but have not necessarily been presented in such detail. IAATO is attempting to present as much factual information as possible in order to clarify activities that have occurred, and are planned for the future.

6.1	According to estimates provided to IAATO by tour operators, approximately 14,000 seaborne, yacht, and land-based tourists may land in Antarctica on commercially organized tour vessels, 160 on land-based expeditions and approximately 100 on commercial yachts and or sailing vessels during the 2002-2003 season.  This represents an increase from the 2001-2002 season.  Appendix B provides a table outlining the diversification of activities and approximate numbers of tourists. There will be three IAATO-member large vessels visiting the Antarctic Peninsula during the 2002-03 season. This represents an increase from the 2001-2002 season. During the 2003-2004 season at least one more additional large cruise-only vessel (no landings) plans to visit Antarctica.

        6.2 We assume that DAP and Lan Chile are planning on flying tourists from Punta Arenas, Chile, to King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at Marsh Base. Specific information is difficult to obtain. Contact either airlines directly for information.

        6.3 There is a proposed tourist operation for the 2002-03 season intending to operate from Cape Town, South Africa, to Dronning Maud Land.  Details on number of flights, estimated tourists or operational logistics is currently unavailable.

        6.4 Some national program vessels carry tourists. National Programs should report their tourist numbers and activities. 

7	Antarctic Tourism Trends

7.1	For the past 13 years, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has compiled and distributed detailed information on Antarctic tourist activities. IAATO collaborates with NSF to ensure that all Antarctic tourism is represented, not just that of U.S. organizers. Appendices include the following tables and charts compiled by NSF and IAATO to reflect the 2001-2002 season. This data is an invaluable resource, showing tourism activity at individual landing sites over time.

Appendix D	Peninsula Sites Ranking in the Top 5 Most Visited Sites 
	*Note Appendix C, D are Excel documents and are attachments to this paper

7.2	The following data sheets will be placed on the IAATO website under the category of “Tourism Statistics.” (1) Continental Sites, Ranking in the Top 8 Most Visited Sites for the Last 11 seasons (1992-2002 ), (2) Summary of Continental Sites Visited by Tour Ships, 2001-2002,  (3) Overview of Continental Sites Visited over 10 seasons, (4) Thirteen  Season (1989-2002 ) Overview of Sites Visited in the Antarctic Peninsula, (5) 2001-2002 Summary of Peninsula Sites Visited by Tour Ships, (6) Peninsula Sites Ranking in the Top 5 Most Visited Sites for the last 13 Seasons (7) 2001-2002  Tourists by Nationality, (8) 2001-2002  Nationalities of Seaborne and Land-Based Antarctic Tourists, (9) Comparison of Nationalities 1994-2002, (10) Projected Trends in Antarctic Tourism, (11) 1992-2002  Antarctic Tourist Trends, (12) Summary of Seaborne and Land-Based Antarctic Tourism by Departures 2001–2002.

        7.3 During the 2001-2002 season the following 10 Peninsula sites were the most highly visited by tourists, crew and staff. Total numbers of people are in brackets.
    • Whalers Bay (6,972) 
    • Half Moon Island (5,317)
    • Pendulum Cove (4,994)
    • Port Lockroy/Goudier Island (4,412)
    • Neko Harbour (4,233)
    • Cuverville Island (4,155)
    • Waterboat Point (3,758)
    • Paulet Island (3,357)
    • Hannah Point (2,927)
    • Jougla Point-adjacent to Port Lockroy (2,796)

        7.4 During the 2001-2002 season the following 7 Continental sites were ranked as the most highly visited by tourists, expedition staff and crew. Total numbers of people are in brackets.
    • Cape Adare (455)
    • Cape Evans-Ross Island (402)
    • Terra Nova Station (269)
    • Cape Hallett (246)
    • Cape Royds-Ross Island (246)
    • Cape Washington (201)
    • McMurdo Station (156)

*Note the above numbers are inclusive of all expedition staff, crew and passengers. In order to measure long-term cumulative impact it is necessary to look at the total number of people who landed at each site and not just tourists.

        7.5 IAATO currently predicts that Antarctic tourism will continue to grow if, as expected, large ships include Antarctica in itineraries such as “Round the World,” or “Round South America” etc. Currently there are approximately 20 large ships visiting South America that could add Antarctica into their cruise itineraries. The significant increase in numbers reflects the numbers carried by large vessels but not necessarily the number of tourists that might land in Antarctica or for how long the tourists would land.

        7.6 IAATO will continue to monitor developments in the tourism industry. Antarctic tourism will probably remain a relatively specialized and expensive niche destination offered mainly by a small number of experienced small ship tour operators, whose focus will continue to be on educational voyages to areas of exceptional natural history and wilderness value. There is a more visible trend towards the diversification of activities from these tourist vessels such as scuba diving, mountain climbing and kayaking. In addition large ships are likely to operate voyages in the region but with few or no landings in Antarctica, placing more emphasis on the scenic beauty aspects. Large ships have been visiting the Antarctic Peninsula on a regular basis since 1993.

8	Conclusion
In practice and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether or not associated with IAATO – are included in emergency contact information, exchange of information and other activities of the IAATO Secretariat. Prospective members are encouraged to participate in the annual general meeting of IAATO, where IAATO Bylaws and operating procedures, obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System and other matters are discussed and policies developed.

				Appendix B

Forecast of Antarctic Tourism for next five years.  Seasons 2002/3 - 2006/7

Note, this is an ‘ESTIMATE’ only.  There is limited communication from new small companies and large ship operators. As the industry changes, so will the estimates. It is difficult to predict the number of large ships or aircraft entering the Antarctic Market at this stage and therefore the 2002-2006 increases are only a guess.  

IAATO is not provided with information on government supported tourist programs, tourist trips operated by Russian and South African tour operators, or the Chilean Navy or specific air overflight operations to the Antarctic Peninsula.

It is important to recognize that the numbers shown below would be more likely to decrease than increase.
