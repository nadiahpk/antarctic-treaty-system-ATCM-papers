Antarctic State of the Environment Reporting 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Article 12, paragragh 1 (j) of the Madrid Protocol states that the Committee for 
Environmental Protection is to provide advice on the state of the Antarctic environment.   
Antarctic State of the Environment Reporting was originally raised at ATCM XX (1996) 
and has been discussed at most subsequent ATCM, CEP and SCAR meetings but there 
has been no clear commitment to a practical way forward.  
 
The cost associated with the production of an extensive hard-copy State of the 
Environment (SOE) report can be prohibitive, and the ability of this style of report to 
dynamically respond to changing conditions and remain current is questionable. With this 
in mind, an automated computer-based system has been developed by the Australian 
Antarctic Division over the top of a suite of Antarctic environmental indicators. The 
system remains current, is largely self managed and is capable of concise reporting of 
environmental status via the Web to scientists, environmental managers and the public 
whenever and wherever required. 
 
A System for Indicator Monitoring and Reporting (SIMR) 
 
SIMR is a Web-enabled database system (http://www-aadc.aad.gov.au/soe/default.asp) 
that has a number of advantages over static SOE reports. Data can be entered into the 
system whenever it becomes available. SIMR has the ability to either automatically 
capture data from instruments or e-mail ‘indicator custodians’ to enter their latest data. 
The system also prompts custodians for an evaluation of the status of the indicator at 
predefined times. 
  
The acceptance of SIMR within the Australian Antarctic community is based on its 
power and simplicity. The system stores two components, the indicator data and a 
standard suite of information about each indicator (Attachment A). The latter is stored 
within a metadata record visible on the Antarctic Master Directory. A SOE report can be 
generated at any time, and this report will reflect all information entered into the system. 
SIMR is however only as effective in reporting on the state of the environment as the 
information it contains. A suite of SOE indicators (Attachment B) that captures key 
aspects of the Antarctic environment was generated by a diverse group of experts. New 
indicators are easily added to the system and ineffective ones dropped.

TEMPLATE DESCRIBING EACH INDICATOR 
 
SIMR stores information against each of the items in the table below for each indicator. Items 
marked with an asterisk* are for administrative purposes and are not used when a standard report 
is requested. In addition to the evaluations for each indicator, there are theme-based evaluations.
