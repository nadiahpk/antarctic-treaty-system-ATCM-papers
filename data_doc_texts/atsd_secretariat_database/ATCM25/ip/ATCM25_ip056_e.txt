The Australian Antarctic Division’s Environmental Management System 
 
 
Introduction 
In 2001 the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) began implementation of a formal environmental 
management system (EMS) to fully comply with the international standard for environmental 
management systems, ISO14001.  A certification audit is scheduled for late this year. 
 
The AAD, in common with other Antarctic research and support agencies, has developed over 
many decades management practices appropriate to international and national agreements and 
laws, operational capabilities and national culture.  The AAD has adjusted to increasing legal 
and operational complexity by tailoring its environmental management processes with due 
regard to domestic laws, the principles of the Madrid Protocol and the decisions of the CEP.   
 
Environmental management processes which address the international standard for EMS will 
provide greater transparency, accountability, and organisational focus on continuously 
improving Australia’s obligations to protect the Antarctic environment. 
 
EMS SCOPE  
The AAD’s EMS is scoped to include the organisation’s activities at all of its sites: 
 Headquarters complex in Kingston, Tasmania 
 the wharf facility in Hobart, Tasmania 
 Antarctic station and field sites 
 Australian subantarctic sites.  
The EMS covers direct employees of the AAD as well as participants in the Australian Antarctic 
program from other agencies, amounting to some 500 people annually. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY 
In accordance with the International Standard, the AAD produced in 2001 an environmental policy 
document, which outlines a commitment to environmental protection and provides the foundation for 
the EMS. The policy is available on the AAD website (http://www.aad.gov.au).  A copy is attached. 
 
The policy was produced in wide consultation with staff and partner organisations, resulting in a high 
level of awareness and ownership. It will be reviewed at least annually. 
 
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS 
ISO14001 takes a widely used cyclic approach to management systems incorporating the 
“continual improvement” principle:   
 
 
  
 
 
 
Unlike many organisations setting out to implement an EMS, the AAD already had in place many 
environmental practices.  The EMS implementation process initially involved a gap analysis against 
the requirements of the Standard (i.e. ISO 14001), and began with a thorough environmental review 
by external consultants of existing AAD activities and systems. 
 
A working group of AAD officers responsible for groups of activities within the Australian Antarctic 
program was convened to define the environmental aspects of activities at the various sites.  The 
environmental aspects were then ranked using a standard risk assessment process.  As a result the 
AAD refined existing management systems and procedures, and devised new ones as appropriate to 
meet the requirements of the Standard. 
 
A thorough review was also conducted to identify documents relevant to the control of activities with 
environmentally significant aspects, ranging from processes such as permits and EIA, to training 
materials and engineering instructions. Document inventories were compiled showing responsible 
officers, document types and review dates, and document control processes were implemented where 
necessary. 
 
With respect to the Antarctic elements of the program, the AAD has retained prime 
accountability for strategic-level issues with Headquarters staff.  Responsibility for aspects of 
the system directly related to environmental management activities at Antarctic sites will 
increasingly lie with Station, Field, or Voyage Leaders, in accordance with an annual brief 
and task list against which they are required to report monthly. 
 
SYSTEM FEATURES   
The AAD is managing the EMS with a proprietary software program providing a database 
which includes process steps, responsible officers, documents, objectives and targets, as well 
as an automated reporting and reminder system. Personnel with key EMS responsibilities 
have access to the system to enter and review their elements of the environmental 
management programs. 
 
Legal compliance protocols were compiled covering 45 individual pieces of relevant 
environmental legislation across the Australian domestic jurisdictions in which the AAD 
operates.  These complement the Madrid Protocol compliance assessment process which the 
AAD developed for the Australian program in 1994.

Environmental awareness training is delivered principally through an interactive web-based 
package, which all participants in the program are required to complete.  The package 
constitutes a pilot program for other e-learning initiatives across the organisation, including 
more focussed environmental training elements for expedition personnel. 
 
Officers with key EMS responsibilities have received training in the requirements of the 
Standard, and an ongoing EMS Coordinator has been appointed. 
 
Components of the certification audit directly related to the Antarctic sites were conducted by 
telephone, supported extensively by photographs, maps, models and GIS material.  It is 
expected that certification auditors will visit at least one station in the next two years.
