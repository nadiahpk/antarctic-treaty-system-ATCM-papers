1. 
Introduction 
 
Wastewater (sewage and domestic grey water) from New Zealand’s Scott Base is 
currently macerated and discharged through a short ocean outfall.  The sewage is not 
treated in any way to reduce the content of solids, the organic strength (BOD), or the 
bacteria concentration. In October 2002, a new wastewater treatment plant will be 
commissioned at the base.  This paper outlines the rationale to treat the discharge, 
describes the treatment options considered, and provides details of the selected 
wastewater treatment plant. 
 
 
2. 
The Treatment Rationale 
 
Antarctica New Zealand (the New Zealand Antarctic Institute) operates Scott Base on 
Ross Island, in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica.  Since 1957, untreated wastewater 
has been discharged into the sea in front of the base.  The base is occupied year round 
with up to 120 people in summer and 12 in winter.  Total daily maximum wastewater 
flow is approximately 70,000 litres per day in summer.  Although this process meets 
the minimum requirement under Article 5.1 (b) of the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Antarctica New Zealand’s commitment to high 
standards of environmental practice led to a decision to treat this discharge. 
 
The rationale to treat sewage was based around an analysis of the following key 
factors:  
 
(i) Actual and Potential Environmental Impacts  
Assessment of the actual and potential environmental impacts associated with the 
current disposal practice demonstrated that there are adverse impacts on receiving 
water quality and evidence also indicates that contamination of the local marine fauna 
is occurring.  In particular, viruses, bacteria and genetic material pose the highest 
potential risk to the environment.  There have also been, and continue to be, health 
and safety issues associated with the location of the seawater and potable water intake 
sites and contaminants from the wastewater discharge.  Contamination at the potable 
and aquarium seawater intake has also been recorded.  The clear potential for waste 
water treatment to result in a significant reduction of current and potential 
environmental impacts was also considered. 
 
(ii) The Environmental Protocol 
A review of Environmental Protocol requirements included consideration of:  
• the principles contained in Article 3 which include the need to limit adverse 
impacts on the Antarctic environment including on water quality; and  
 
2 
• the specific waste management aspects contained in Annex III including the need 
to minimise the impacts of waste disposal and the requirement to discharge 
sewage and domestic liquid wastes wherever practicable where conditions exist 
for initial dilution and rapid dispersal.   
 
(iii) New Zealand Legislation  
A review of New Zealand legislation, regulations and guidelines was carried out as 
they relate to wastewater disposal, including current “best practice”.  The review 
indicated that a discharge of this nature would be treated if occurring in New Zealand.   
 
(iv) Antarctic “Best Practice” 
Consideration was also given to current practice for wastewater treatment by other 
national operators in Antarctica.  There is a precedent from other Antarctic Treaty 
parties to provide treatment of wastewater being discharged into the marine 
environment.  In the Ross Sea region, Italy have been treating wastewater at Terra 
Nova Bay Station, by chemical and physical treatment and UV disinfection since 
1987.  The United States, at their McMurdo Station, are currently in the process of 
installing a new treatment plant.  There are also a number of other stations throughout 
Antarctica of similar size to Scott Base, that already treat their wastewater. 
 
(v) Aesthetic and Cultural Considerations 
Aesthetic and cultural considerations were also taken into account, including issues of 
public perception.  In New Zealand, the discharge of untreated wastewater is no 
longer regarded as culturally or socially acceptable.   
 
 
After consideration of these key factors, Antarctica New Zealand decided to provide 
for treatment of the wastewater discharge at Scott Base.  This decision was in keeping 
with Antarctica New Zealand’s ongoing commitment through its environmental 
policy to limit any adverse impacts on the environment of its activities.  Meeting best 
practice standards for New Zealand and Antarctica in relation to wastewater treatment 
was also an important consideration.

Setting an Effluent Standard 
 
Testing and analysis of the current untreated discharge showed it to have the 
following characteristics: 
 
Characteristic 
Value 
Notes 
Maximum daily flow 
20m3/day 
Based on 122 persons at 164l/person/day

Antarctica New Zealand resolved to provide treatment of the sewage before discharge 
to the ocean, to a nominal standard of <30m/l BOD and SS and <200 cfu/100ml faecal 
coliforms.  This standard, or better, will be achieved by providing secondary treatment 
followed by disinfection by UV light.  Effluent treated to this standard, will, when 
dispersed by the local currents, provide a seawater quality suitable for human 
consumption of shell fish living in that environment.  This standard was adopted as 
being conservative, realistic, measurable and achievable on a consistent basis. 
 
Other performance requirements specified for the system were as follows: 
 
• The de-watering plant shall de-water the sludge generated by the treatment 
process to approximately 20 percent solids (80 percent moisture) or better; 
 
• Sludge production must be minimal; and 
 
• The sewage treatment systems offered must be capable of treatment of sewage 
containing up to 28 percent of seawater. 
 
 
4. 
Treatment Options  
 
A number of issues were considered when determining which treatment system 
should be implemented at Scott Base.  These included effluent quality, size of the 
system and building requirements, staff inputs for sludge management, capital and 
operating costs, and the “track record” of each system.  The chosen system needed to 
reliable and be capable of producing a consistent output with minimum maintenance, 
given the variation in loadings over the year.   
 
The following systems were short listed for consideration and assessed against these 
criteria for their suitability.  A number of other options were also considered 
(including composting, chemical processes, and electrolytic oxidation) but were 
eliminated earlier in the selection process.  An environmental impact assessment 
process was also initiated during the selection process and was integral to it.  The 
resulting document, an initial environmental evaluation (IEE) was produced in June 
2001 (Annex I).   
 
System 
 
Description 
Assessment 
Electrolysis 
The wastewater is diluted with seawater 
and an electric current is passed through 
it to generate chlorine, which oxidises 
and disinfects the wastewater.   
 
 
Rejected because of the risk of producing 
chlorinated organic compounds that could be 
toxic to and accumulate in the environment.  
The system could not achieve the desired 
quality other than by dilution with seawater. 
 
Rotating 
Biological 
Contactor (RBC) 
 
Uses plastic mesh discs that provide a 
surface for bacteria to cling to.  The disc 
rotates so that it alternatively rotates into 
the air and then into the wastewater. 
Waste solids are settled out as sludge and 
de-watered for disposal.  Disinfection is 
provided by ultraviolet light. 
 
A suitable technology with low power 
demand and capable of a high standard of 
treatment.  Used at Australian bases and at 
Terra Nova Bay (Italy).  The large size and 
hence cost of housing the plant was 
considered a disadvantage.

System 
 
Description 
Assessment 
Fixed Media 
Aeration 
 
The wastewater is treated in a chamber 
containing plastic mesh on which grows 
a bacterial biofilm.  Aeration is provided 
by air blown into the bottom of the 
chamber through fine holes.  Waste 
solids are settled out as sludge and de-
watered for disposal.  Disinfection is 
provided by ultraviolet light. 
 
A suitable technology but with higher power 
demand than a RBC, compact and suited to 
housing in a container. 
 
Submerged 
Membrane 
Activated Sludge 
 
Wastewater is treated in a tank with 
suspended bacteria aerated by air blown 
through fine nozzles.  Bundles of fine 
hollow tubes with porous walls 
(membranes) are suspended in the tank 
and treated wastewater is drawn through 
the tube walls and out through the hollow 
centre by suction. The process is 
essentially an activated sludge process, 
but does not require a clarifier to settle 
bacteria solids from the effluent and 
return it to the treatment tank. Excess 
sludge is removed and de-watered for 
disposal. 
 
This process is capable of producing a very 
high standard of treatment, because the 
membranes achieve very fine filtration.  
However, the process was rejected because 
the membrane cassettes require periodic 
lifting up above the aeration tank for 
cleaning, which would require housing in a 
building at least 7m high.  This requirement 
would be very expensive and obtrusive.  The 
capital cost was very high and the operating 
cost was also very high because of the need 
to replace the membranes every 8-10 years. 
 
Moving Bed 
Bioreactor 
 
Treatment of wastewater is provided in a 
tank containing individual plastic media 
with growth of bacterial biofilm.  The 
media are free to move about in the tank. 
Subsequent treatment tanks have fixed 
plastic media similar to the “fixed media 
aeration” process.  All tanks are aerated 
with air blown in through fine nozzles. 
Waste solids are settled out as sludge and 
de-watered for disposal.  Disinfection is 
provided by ultraviolet light. 
The process was suitable for Scott Base, but 
was not offered as a complete system.  The 
size of the tanks did not conform to standard 
shipping container sizes, and the effluent 
quality did not meet the specifications. 
 
 
 
5. 
Selected Option  
 
After consideration of the options, the fixed media aeration system was chosen for the 
following reasons: 
 
• ability to meet the specified treatment standards; 
• conservative process design; 
• simplicity of operation; 
• ability to be successfully operated by non specialist staff; 
• robust configuration; 
• engineering redundancy and reliability; 
• low maintenance requirements; 
• compact format and minimal "footprint"; and 
• "plug and play" design requiring minimal work to install, connect and commission 
in Antarctica. 
 
An operational schematic of the chosen treatment plant is illustrated in Figure 1.

The plant was designed and fabricated in New Zealand between November 2001 and 
January 2002.  The plant was constructed within two ISO-20 shipping containers and 
shipped to Scott Base in February 2002.  The containers were placed on 1 m high 
foundations and a steel frame erected for the top compartment.  Insulated panels were 
then attached around the plant (see Figure 2).

An important feature of the plant is that it will make use of waste heat from the 
existing ablutions facility thus reducing its overall energy demand.  The plant is 
scheduled to be commissioned in early October 2002.  The estimated final 
commissioned cost is NZ$500,000.

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY 
 
The Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) relates to the proposal by Antarctica New 
Zealand to start treating wastewater produced at Scott Base, Pram Point, Ross Island, 
Antarctica.  The wastewater at Scott Base is currently macerated and discharged 
through a short ocean outfall.  This process meets the minimum requirement under 
Article 5.1 (b) of the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994, to treat sewage 
by maceration. 
 
However, Antarctica New Zealand has decided that treatment of the wastewater 
should be provided, to minimise environmental effects on the receiving environment.  
Currently, sewage from Scott Base is not treated in any way to reduce the content of 
solids, the organic strength (BOD), or the bacterial concentration. A number of 
wastewater treatment system options that would improve the quality of the wastewater 
from Scott Base have been considered.  Four wastewater treatment options have been 
identified that would meet appropriate treatment standards.  These include: 
 
§ Reaman (rotating biological contactor) 
§ Blivet Aerator (rotating biological contactor) 
§ Smith & Loveless “FAST” (aerated fixed media) 
§ Innovative Water Systems (aerated fixed media) 
 
Tenders have been invited for all four systems from the suppliers.   
 
Specific actions associated with the proposal causing impacts include; visual intrusion 
from the pipeline and insulated containers housing the system, ground disturbance 
through earth moving activities and construction of foundations for the system.  The 
environmental impacts (including the benefits) of the proposal are discussed in the 
context of the highly disturbed nature of the Pram Point environment and the marine 
environment surrounding the area. 
 
The results of the evaluation of impacts of the proposal indicate that the activities are 
likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment and will 
in fact significantly minimise the environmental effects on the receiving environment 
as compared to current practices.
