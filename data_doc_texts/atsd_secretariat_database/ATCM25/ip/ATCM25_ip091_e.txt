Introduction to the issue of insurance in Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection  ( Liability/Response Measures ) 

In order to facilitate compliance with, or to strengthen, the obligations of operators arising from the Annex on Liability/Response Measures pursuant to Article XVI, a method of compulsory financial responsibility should be envisaged. Whenever it is decided to allow the performance of certain activities, with the knowledge that they may cause injuries and   generate adverse effects, in this context to the Antarctic Environment and dependent and associate ecosystems, it has generally been considered necessary to provide, in advance, for guarantees of payment for damage, including damage to the environment.   The question of insurance is also very important because it provides support, on an equal level, to the activities of various operators, and not only those who have significant financial and material means at their disposal, in the event of emergencies or  other detrimental effects on the environment.

    • As a method of financial responsibility, State Parties authorizing activities to be conducted by operators should request evidence of insurance, surety bonds, letters of credit or other financial security covering their liability as defined in this Annex..

    • For insurance policies to fulfill their objectives, insurers must be registered under the laws of a State Party and subject to its regulations.  It must be required that operators hold insurances with an authorized company in order to meet obligations deriving from the Protocol and its Annexes.

 Scope and characteristics 

    • The definition and scope of damage is directly related to the operation of insurance.  In the case of the Protocol and the draft Annexes, operators will be subject to two types of requirements:

    a) the obligation to compensate those undertaking response action and,
 
b) the obligation to provide payment in the case of lasting and significant harmful impact on the environment. Such obligation will become enforceable should response action not be possible. As to the latter, the manner in which  unrepaired  damages or irreparable harmful impacts will be dealt with by the Annex should be clarified. It is certainly of a different kind due to the nature of  the protected value (Vide Article 8, paragraph 2 a) of CRAMRA). 

    • There is also need to establish limits along the lines of the objective or strict nature of the liability regime;

    • Punitive damages should not be covered by insurers; 

    • In order to facilitate management of the system and provide certainty to claimants direct action against insurers should be allowed.

    • Different types of insurance policies to protect the Antarctic environment as well as dependent and associated ecosystems, should be provided for in order to compensate response action, including the clean up, pollution, reinstatement, etc.  

    • One of the points needing further study is the responsibility and any liability acquired by those providing advice or participating in the decision making process related to the Antarctic activities which may result in environmental emergencies and harmful consequences.  This personal responsibility and eventual liability may also be covered by insurance(s). 

The Annex should not exclude already approved civil liability regimes (already adopted) applicable to cases governed by the Protocol. This aspect, which was highlighted in the Netherlands draft comprehensive liability annex, as well as in the document introduced by Chile, is certainly relevant to the pertinent application of insurance schemes contained in treaties or agreements to which Antarctic Treaty Parties are also Parties and whose global character encompasses Antarctica. 

On the other hand, the need to establish limits for insurance purposes, which prevails in all international instruments establishing strict liability regimes, obviously does not preclude that other means be implemented by the Liability Annex to the extent that the yield of the insurance of the financial security is inadequate to satisfy further claims for compensation derived from damage to the Antarctic Environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.
