Glaciological studies
 at the russian 
Station Vostok
























Glaciological studies at Vostok Station.

The glaciological fieldworks have been carried out in the vicinity of Vostok Station and in the Lake Vostok area in conjunction with remote (radio-echo and seismic) surveys of Lake Vostok. Snow samples have been collected in eight 3-m pits and in three 12-m pits (spanning 50 to 250 years, respectively) located within 3-4 km from the Vostok Station and along oversnow traverses completed to 50-300 km northward of the station. Collected samples have been analyzed for gross -radioactivity, liquid electrical conductivity, stable isotopes (18O, D), major ion chemistry, and microbiological particles. The 1-km2 stake farm (located 2 km apart from Vostok), that had been operating on a monthly basis since 1970, was extended by a new, similar stake farm assigned to replace the old one in a few years when its stakes would be eventually buried in snow.

Eight high-resolution annual records of accumulation and isotope composition of snow have been completed for the period 1940-1999 and two records for the period 1770-1999. The main objectives of this study are to reconstruct high-resolution local temperature and accumulation histories covering the past 200-250 years and to refine paleoclimatic interpretation of the deep ice core data using a direct comparison of the isotope composition of the upper snow and the 42-year instrumental records from Vostok Station.
The laboratory studies of the deep Vostok ice core have been completed to a depth of 3611 m. Isotope analyses, ECM and gas content measurements show that, below a depth of 3538-3539 m, the Vostok core consist of ice refrozen from Lake Vostok water. This discovery opens the way for investigations, through lake ice studies, of a microbial population of Lake Vostok isolated from the rest of the biosphere for more than million years. Chemical and gas composition of sub-ice water needed for evaluation of biological observations can also be inferred from lake ice analyses. In particular, the thermodynamic calculations based on air content data obtained from the ice core suggest a high oxygen tension in Lake Vostok. The concentration of the dissolved oxygen is estimated to be between 27 and 1.3 103 mg l-1 (compare to 15 mg O2 for standard conditions).

Molecular biological studies by PCR-based analyses of 16S rDNA in Vostok ice show that glacier ice, accreted ice and thus likely the lake water itself are extremely pure in regard to microbes. Very low DOC (dissolved organic carbon) content (0.0-24.7 ppb) in accreted and glacier ice, along with a specific DNA content, suggest an autotrophic rather than heterotrophic life in the lake.

Vostok Lake Project

Study of any geographical object begins as a rule with investigation of its spatial location characteristics. For lakes, this is the area of the water table, coastline character, bathymetry, morphology of the shores and bottom sediments. The satellite image of the ice surface where an extensive relatively flat segment was defined was the first information about the spatial location of Lake Vostok in Antarctica.

Fig 3. Location map and investigations of  sub-glacial Lake Vostok

It was this segment that was interpreted as the configuration of this lake on the ice surface. The characteristics of this subglacial water body can be naturally investigated only by means of remote sensing methods among which the radio- echo sounding and seismic sounding are most informative. Using these methods, one can obtain:
    • coastline position,
    • map of ice thickness, 
    • map of subglacial relief, 
    • map of water layer thickness distribution, and
    • map of sedimentary rock thickness distribution.
The analysis of such information will provide understanding of the geological aspects of origin and evolution of this natural water body.
Specialized annual studies of the subglacial Lake Vostok began at the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) in 1995 with seismic soundings. In 1998, they were supplemented by ground-based radio-echo sounding. A special digital radio-echo sounding station RLS-60-98 was specially designed and manufactured for the latter. Any measurement method has both its advantages and disadvantages. Ground-based radio-echo sounding compared to airborne has a more accurate geographical linking and makes it possible to conduct surveys over a non-regular network. The latter fact allows us to obtain more detailed information on the character of the surface surveyed. In spite of a lower cost of ground-based echo-sounding, the time it requires is much greater that the duration of the airborne surveys.
The ground-based radio-echo sounding of the Lake Vostok coastline performed by RAE during the period 1998-2002 has allowed us to collect the following evidence :
    • Lake Vostok really presents a closed water body;
    • its western shore is significantly dissected by bays, inlets, capes and peninsulas while the eastern shore has an even character;
    • actual coastline boundaries  are typically greater than the lake dimensions revealed on the daytime surface of the ice sheet especially in its eastern and northern parts;
    • determination of the coastline position in the northern lake area is complicated by some problems of interpreting the radio-echo-sounding data;
    • ice cover thickness increases from south to north (from 3750 m above Vostok station to 4350 m in the northwestern lake area).
Seismic soundings performed by the method of reflected waves have allowed us to collect data on the thickness of ice, water layer and bottom sediments predominantly in the southern lake area and along its longitudinal axis in the S-N direction.
The upper boundary of the lake water layer is 300-600 m below the sea level. The southern lake area is deep (with the water layer thickness up to 1200 m), while the southern part is shallow (several tens of meters) . The greatest sedimentary rock thickness was also recorded in the southern lake area. A similar picture in respect of the water layer and bottom sediment thickness is observed in the eastern and western part of the lake. The eastern area is characterized by deepwater with the largest thickness of sedimentary rocks whereas the western area is on the contrary shallow, and a peculiar underwater ridge in the southern lake area separates them . Interpretation of seismic soundings is complicated by a small width of a deepwater basin where the lake is located. The basin is restricted by steep lake “sides” that result in the additional reflections of seismic waves.

The main results of the Russian geophysical studies of the subglacial Lake Vostok are as follows:
    • the subglacial lake presents a closed water body restricted by the bedrock coastline. The lake is located below the ocean level;
    • the water table area is about 16900 km2;
    • based on the results of measurements, maps and sections of the distribution of ice, water layer and sediment thickness and of the sub-ice relief were plotted;
    • the bathymetric structure  of the lake consists of two parts: deepwater southern and eastern and shallow northern and western;
    • the maximum ice thickness (4350 m) was recorded in the northwestern lake area and the maximum water layer thickness in the southwestern area (1200 m);
    • the western shore of the lake is strongly dissected and the eastern is even.

The remote sensing of the Antarctic Ice Sheet coastal line dynamics

Institute of Geography RAS carries out this project within the frames of the Federal Research Program “Study and Research in Antarctica”
Monitoring of the coastal line of Antarctic Ice Sheet presumes the existence of considerable volume of factual data obtained from the marginal zone of ice sheet.
Existence, wide spread and accessibility of remote sensing technologies allow to evaluate the coastline changes of the whole continent over second part of XX century.
The satellite images received for the marginal zone of the Antarctic ice sheet are analyzed. These data are classified on 12 Antarctic ice-catchments and is the basis for database on remote sensing of the marginal part of Antarctic Ice sheet, which is the actual task for the majority of the projects, studding the Antarctic Ice sheet.
As the target for the first stage of the Project (2000-2002) the data from ground based geodetic surveys, aerial photos, “Kosmos”, “Meteor” and “Landsat” satellites are used to estimate the Antarctic Ice Sheet coastal line dynamics within the test sites of Ice-Catchment IV (Q-44, 45, 46, 47 and 48).
Shakleton and West Ice Shelves as well as Denman, Scott and Philippi Outlet Glaciers provided by maps of high quality and satellite images were selected as the first objects for studies of ice front’s fluctuations.
From 1947 to 1956 Denman Outlet Glacier front retreated due to calving by 50 km and lost approx. 1,600 km2, forming icebergs (before 1956 and in 1984). From 1956 to 1979 Denman Outlet Glacier front advanced with the mean velocity of 1,450 m/year and the accretion of square came up to 1,400 km2. From 1979 to 1986 it’s front retreated by 45 km – the south most position from observed over last 100 years. During last 15 years (up to 2001) the advance with mean velocity of 1670 m/year was observed.
The adjacent Scott Outlet Glacier from 1947 to 1956 lost considerable part of the square (310 km2) and it’s front retreated by 9 km. After (up to 2001) this glacier advanced permanently: from 1956 to 1979 - by 9 km with mean velocity of 310 m/year (166 km2); from 1979 to 1986 – by 7 km with mean velocity of 840 m/year (110 km2); and from 1986 to 2001 – by 13 km with mean velocity of 880 m/year (286 km2). Total accretion of the square since 1956 is 544 km2.

Noticeable changes in front position were fixed for the eastern part of Shakleton Ice Shelf. From 1947 to 1956 glacier front advanced by 5 km with mean velocity of 550 m/year and square accretion was equal to 296 km2. From 1956 to 1979 the retreat by 3.6 km was observed. From 1979 to 1986 glacier front retreated by 12 km and lost in square approx. 626 km2. Up to 2000 Shakleton Ice Shelf front retreated by 8.5 km and lost 313 km2. Total reduction of the square since 1956 is equal to 1,100 km2.
The most marked changes from observed occurred on West Ice Shelf. It’s front in the middle part retreated by 33 km from 1957 to 1979 and estimated reduction of the square was equal to 1,700 km2. From 1979 to 1984 ice front advanced inconsiderably with mean velocity of 260 m/year. Up to 2000, ice front advanced by 8.4 km with velocities of 410-640 m/year. Total accretion of the square since 1957 is 2,000 km2. In the eastern part of Ice Shelf the (Philippi Outlet Glacier) ice front advanced from 1957 to 1979 by 13.5 km and accretion of the square was equal to 845 km2. From 1979 to 1984 ice front advanced by 12.3 km with square accretion of approx. 1,000 km2. The marketable recession was observed after 1984. The ice front up to 2001 retreated by 71 km, so the stream created by Philippi Outlet Glacier was completely destroyed.

The results of investigations testify close links between the dynamics of marginal part of Antarctic Ice Sheet and hydro-meteorological conditions near the cost. The periods of intensive advance coincide with the intensity of cyclonic activity, heat advection and increase of snow accumulation on the Ice Sheet as well as sea level rise under the high flood. Periods of lowering of the ice motion reflect the moderation of cyclonic activity, decrease of snow accumulation and air temperature in Antarctic as well as sea level fall under the low flood.
The database on remote sensing of the marginal part of Antarctic Ice sheet presents interactive hierarchic information structure, which contains the information in vector, raster and table formats on 3 main levels. First level – the whole Antarctic Ice Sheet, which allows systematizing glaciological information and shows the main morphological parts of Antarctic Ice sheet (ice-catchments). Second level –ice-catchments, organizing the information on the main ice streams, outlet glaciers and ice shelves within the each from 12 ice-catchments as well as the meteorological data from the stations situated within the ice-catchment. The third level – coastal zone of the ice shelves, outlet glaciers and ice streams within the limits of corresponding ice-catchement. Here the information on each remote sensing type such as temporal and spatial coverage, resolution etc. is stored. This level is the principal for the analysis of the information and conduct studies.
