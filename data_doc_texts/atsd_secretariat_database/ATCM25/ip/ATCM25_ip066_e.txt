4-1	Waste Management Plans Prepared in Accordance with Annex III, Article 8 of the Protocol (Annex III, Article 9 (1) of the Protocol)

The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) introduced the Waste Management Plan to implement necessary operating procedures such as segregation, disposal and management of wastes after the Madrid Protocol was completed in 1991. 

According to the plan, some combustible wastes are incinerated and sewage and grey water are treated by the biological treatment plant and its sludge is carbonized into charcoal. The ash, the charcoal and other wastes are brought back to Japan. 

Larger wastes such as snow vehicles, trucks and building materials stored at Syowa Station are also brought back to Japan every year according to the clean-up operation plan.
