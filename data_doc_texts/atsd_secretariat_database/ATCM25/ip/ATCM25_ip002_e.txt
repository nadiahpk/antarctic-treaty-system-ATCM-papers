Deglaciation at Admiralty Bay, King George Island 
(South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica) 
 
 
 
 
Ecology Glacier (Warszawa Icefield system), situated south of the 
Polish H. Arctowski Station, has been in a state of continuous retreat over the 
past 45 years, at least since 1956/7. This is a tidewater-type glacier fed by the 
Warszawa Icefield. Its total retreat from 1956/7 to 2000/1 amounts to 450 m in 
central part of the glacier. The retreat was slow from 1956/7 to 1988/9, 
amounting to 4.5-5 m/yr. It rapidly accelerated in the past decade (1989-1999) 
reaching up to 30 m/yr. Presently (2000/1), the glacier's front is aground, save 
for three small coves where it still floats and actively calves. Retreat of the 
glacier's northern lobe between 1978/9 and 2000/1 has freed from the ice a 
considerable area, exposing subglacial deposits of boulder-clay type (lodgement 
till), numerous ice-striated roches mountonnées, kame fields and successive 
retreat/push-moraines. Several outwash fans have formed in eastern part of the 
ice-freed area. 
 
As a result of the glacier's retreat, a considerably large lagoon (Ecology 
Lagoon) has opened in front of the glacier. Its coasts covered by gravelly marine 
beach and stormridge have already been occupied by groups of Elephant Seals 
(Mirounga leonina).  
 
Other glaciers around Warszawa Icefield. A considerable retreat of 
ice fronts since 1956/7 has also been detected at tidewater glaciers such as 
Baranowski Glacier (Admiralty Bay) and Windy Glacier (Bransfield Strait).

Lagoons rimmed by narrow marine gravel beaches and stormridges had formed, 
considerably extending breeding grounds for the seals, particularly Elephant Seal 
(Mirounga leonina) and Fur Seal (Arctocephalus gazella).  
 
Several small glaciers east and south of The Tower (between Baranowski 
Glacier and Windy Glacier) have been strongly reduced in size or even 
completely disappeared since 1977/8. 
 
At Ezcurra Inlet, several steep icefalls: Dera Icefall (at Hervé Cove), 
Ro_ciszewski Icefall (at Monsimet Cove), and Gda_sk Icefall (at Firlej Cove), 
have considerably retreated inland since 1977/8. Lagoons in front of the former 
two icefalls have considerably enlarged since then. 
 
Arctowski Icefield system. Numerous icefalls (Emerald Icefalls) fed by 
the Arctowski Icefield, which hang over steep northern coast of Ezcurra Inlet, 
have been in a quasi-stable state since 1977/8. At Mackellar Inlet (tidewater 
glaciers): Lange Glacier has receded about 2 km since 1956/7; Znosko Glacier 
and Domeyko Glacier have been quasi-stagnant since 1977/8. At Martel Inlet, 
from 1956/7 to 2000/1, ice-front retreat has been noted in tidewater glaciers and 
icefalls fed by the Arctowski Icefield, between Keller Peninsula and Precious 
Peaks: 200-400 m at Stenhouse Glacier, Ajax Icefall and Goetel Glacier. 
 
Kraków Icefield system. At Martel Inlet: Dobrowolski Glacier has 
retreated since 1956/7 by about 800 m; Krak Glacier (at Lussich Cove) had 
retreated mainly prior to 1977/8, but has been rather stable since then; Wanda 
Glacier has been stable since 1977/8. Along the eastern coast of Admiralty Bay, 
the largest Viéville Glacier (between Point Hennequin and Manczarski Point) has 
receded up to 500 m since 1956/7. A retreat of the order of 100-200 m has been 
noted for the same perior in some small tidewater glaciers and icefalls to the 
north and east of Vauréal Peak.

(1) A rapid glacier ice retreat at Admiralty Bay during the past decade or 
two has been noted mainly at some valley-type tidewater glaciers which issue 
from larger ice-caps (domes): Ecology, Baranowski and Windy glaciers 
(Warszawa Icefield); Lange Glacier (Arctowski Icefield); Dobrowolski and Krak 
glaciers (Kraków Icefield).   
 
(2) During the past two decades, considerable retreat and ice-thickness 
reduction, sometimes even disappearance of a glacier, has affected land-based 
glaciers which issue from the Warszawa Icefield: Wróbel Glacier (total ice 
decay), Sphinx Glacier (size reduction by about 1/5), Bastion Glacier (size 
reduction by about 1/2) and Tower Glacier (split in two, size reduction by a 
half). 
 
(3) As a contrary, steep hanging glaciers and icefalls at Ezcurra Inlet 
(Emerald Icefalls), large glaciers/icefalls at Mackellar Inlet (Domeyko Glacier) 
and Martel Inlet (Stenhouse Glacier, Ajax Icefall and Goetel Glacier), and ice-
cliff of Viéville Glacier (Kraków Icefield), though subject to recession from 
1956/7 to 1978/9, did not change much ever since. 
 
(4) Acceleration of retreat in some valley-type tidewater glaciers at 
Admiralty Bay (especially, Ecology, Baranowski and Lange glaciers) and its 
closest vicinity (Windy Glacier) in the past decade, might be a response to 
global climate change. 
 
(5) Whether this rapid retreat is related to a man-made "glasshouse effect", 
or is simply a natural phenomenon unrelated to human activity, is an open 
question. It should be pointed out, however, that King George Island supplied a 
good record, dating back to 13th century, of glacier fronts fluctuations - surges 
and retreats, obviously a natural, and not a man-induced phenomenon.    
 
(6) Retreat of glaciers in the middle and outer parts of Admiralty Bay has 
exposed new ice-free coastal areas already suitable for breeding grounds of

some seal species, probably also for future location of new penguin rookeries.
