Establishment of a High Definition Broadcast Center in the Antarctic

NHK(Japan Broadcasting Corporation) and National Institute of Polar Research,  Japan

1. Purpose
	The National Institute of Polar Research and Japan's public broadcasting entity NHK are now engaged in a joint project to build a television studio capable of high definition broadcasting from the Syowa Station on Ongul Island. Over the course of 2003 we plan many broadcasts covering the breadth of Antarctic nature and the range of scientific research underway there, with both taped and live material.
	It hardly needs repeating that of the most important problems facing humanity is the clash between our own activities and their effects on the earth's systems of climate and biology. It is a matter of growing importance to build awareness, through the insights of scientific research, of our planet as one of many in the universe, characterized by systems which have evolved over nearly 5 billion years. The Antarctic, as a preserved "time capsule" of earth history, seems to us a most appropriate place to consider the earth's future.
	Along with many broadcasts from Syowa Station which will look at the current state of the earth, we hope that in working with various countries' bases and research organizations engaged in Antarctic research we can invite a large audience to join us in considering what we need to do to pass on a vibrant planet to succeeding generations.

2. Summary of Broadcast Equipment and Staff
- Broadcast Equipment: 20 m2 compact studio, high definition editing equipment.
- Transmission Equipment: 4.8 meter 3kW parabola antenna capable of 45 Mbps high definition live broadcast via Intelsat.
- Cameras: High definition cameras; ultra high sensitivity I I color high definition camera capable of capturing astronomical observations such as meteor showers; ultra high sensitivity "Super Harp" camera capable of Aurora photography; high definition remote controlled camera capable of round the clock operation, etc.
- Staff: Director, reporter, cameraman, video engineer, electrician; total 5 persons

3. Basic Broadcast Plan
- April 2003
Simultaneous live broadcast of the Aurora from the Arctic and Antarctic
We will take on the challenge of conducting the first-ever simultaneous broadcast of the Aurora from Syowa Station and its conjugate point in the Arctic. A further 3-dimensional element will be added by images of the aurora taken on the same day by satellite-born cameras.

- Late July/Early August 2003
Great Antarctic Journey in 3 Parts
Antarctic, the last unexplored region on earth. What is the relationship between this ice-covered continent and the subtle balance of the earth's environment? This series will seek to reveal the true face of the unknown Antarctic continent.

- November 24 (Monday) 2003
Live Broadcast of the Total Solar Eclipse
Full capture of the total eclipse from an aircraft at 10,000 meters altitude. The lunar shadow which spreads across the sky, unique to the polar regions, as well as images from satellites of the shadow as it moves across the earth, will be used to explain the total eclipse with new clarity.

- Over the Year
Antarctic Classroom
- Classes will be broadcast linking the Syowa Station and a Japanese school
