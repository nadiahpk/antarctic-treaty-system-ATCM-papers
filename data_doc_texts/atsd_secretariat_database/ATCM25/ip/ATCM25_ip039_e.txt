An Assessment of Environmental Emergencies 
Arising from Activities in Antarctica 
 
CEP V Agenda Item 7 
ATCM XXV 
 
 
IAATO was asked to provide to CEP V an update on environmental emergencies that have 
occurred in the last two years.  
 
There were no significant incidents during the 2000-2001 season in Antarctica.  Two 
incidents occurred during the 2001-2002 season, neither of which created any type of 
significant environmental damage. 
 
One incident was transport-related and the second was equipment failure with one litre of fuel 
having been spilled.  
 
Background 
Resolution 6 of ATCM XXII requested that COMNAP undertake an assessment of the risks 
of environmental emergencies arising from activities in Antarctica, including, but not limited 
to, an analysis of incidents, which have occurred over the past ten years within the Antarctic 
Treaty area. CEP II requested that IAATO provide relevant information with regard to 
environmental emergencies resulting from tourist vessels. IAATO provided XII SATCM IP11 
to CEP III.

Vessel, Professor Molchanov, was moving in dense fog with a large iceberg in front of the 
ship.  The iceberg was approximately 17 miles in length.  The vessel was in lee of the iceberg 
and there appeared to be misunderstanding on the bridge as to the navigational commands 
between officer on watch and the helmsman. By the time the ship was put in full astern mode, 
the moving iceberg was too close to the ship and the vessel could not keep sufficient distance 
from touching the ice.  No lives were in danger and only repairs were needed to the bow 
bulwark. 
 
2.5 ANY OTHER INCIDENT NOT COVERED ABOVE: Environmental hazard caused: 
Description of the Event (i.e. circumstances, weather, cause, details of the accident.)  As 
above. 
3. RESPONSE ACTION TAKEN: The crew repaired the damage and the vessel passed 
surveyor inspection. 
4. OTHER MEASURES TAKEN (including remediation, etc) On return to her homeport, 
Professor Molchanov will go into dry dock for further repairs. 
5. WAS THE ENVIRONMENT RESTORED TO ITS CONDITION PRIOR TO THE 
ACCIDENT? (Yes/No, or other comments)     No damage to the environment. 
6. ESTIMATED COST OF: Damage to property Response action (i.e. Labor and materials 
etc other measures): Unknown.

Injured persons:  
None.  Deaths: None 
8. WERE THERE INJURIES OR DEATHS TO WILDLIFE? species and number: None. 
9. ANY COMMENTS (e.g. Potential accidents or incidents that may cause an environmental 
impact but have not been included in this questionnaire.) None.

1.2 DATE  28 December 2001 
1.3 LOCATION DESCRIPTION  (e.g. station, land, glacier ice, sea, etc Anchorage off scientific 
station).    Esperanza

2. TYPE OF ACCIDENT: Oil Spill 
2.1 OIL SPILL: Type of Oil: Gland oil (propeller shaft) 
Volume of spill: < 1 litre.  
Description of the Event (i.e. circumstances, weather, cause, details of the accident) 
The ship was manoeuvring on the anchorage of Hope Bay off the scientific station 
“Esperanza” on 28 December 2001 at 0700 hrs. During manoeuvres the port propeller 
was damaged. Although the connection from the supply tank to the gland was shut down 
immediately a small amount of oil escaped to the sea. The amount of oil was too small to 
be responded. The station Esperanza was informed immediately about the incident.
