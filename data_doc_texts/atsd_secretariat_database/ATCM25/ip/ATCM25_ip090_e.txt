SUMMARY

During the 2001-02 season the Antarctic Unit of the Tourism Board of Tierra del Fuego continued its survey program of tourist operations to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, developed since 1992-93 season. The results obtained are shown in the current report, which follows the same format as the previous ones. 

The Expedition Leaders of the cruise ships and the tour operator companies collaborate with this survey giving a copy after each voyage made, according to the questionnaire approved by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Resolution 3 (1997), called Post Visit Report. Unfortunately, Part 2 of the above mentioned questionnaire was not available for voyages made onboard  ‘Kapitan Dranitsyn’ #2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, as well as voyages made for 'Professor Molchanov' # 1, 2, 8 and 9. Therefore, data for these journeys  regarding nationalities of passengers and tourist visits to the Antarctic Area done aboard these vessels are missing. 

It should be noted that this report only refers to those Antarctic trips that called at the Port of Ushuaia.

The main results obtained during the 2001-02 season, are:
	The Antarctic ship-borne tourism season through the Port of Ushuaia started on November 8th ., 2001 with the departure to Antarctic waters of 'MS Clipper Adventurer' and ended on March 17th., 2002, with the arrival of ''MS Polar Pioneer'. 

	15 cruise ships operated through the Port of Ushuaia. They made a total of 107 journeys, carrying 12,886 passengers.  

	73% of the journeys were “local journeys”  (that started and ended in Ushuaia). 25% were 'semi-local' trips (that began or finished in Ushuaia). After 6 consecutive seasons with no record, a little proportion of 2% for in transit voyages were made  (journeys that call at Ushuaia in the middle of their cruise).

	In comparison with the previous season, the 2001-02 recorded a small difference in the number of journeys made (1%). However, the number of passengers increased 9% (11,489 vs 12,886). These figures can be related to the presence of large cruise ships during the analyzed season.   

	Regarding the number of passengers that visited Antarctica through other gateways, the Antarctic Unit estimated a total of 13,465 passengers, 12,886 of those called at the port of Ushuaia at least once.  

	As results, 95% of all visitors calling at the local port: Ushuaia remains the most popular “Gateway To Antarctica”  

	The maximum capacity of the cruises ranged between 46 and 1200 passengers. The small ships (up to 100 passengers) made a total of 58 trips and carried 3,495 passengers, the medium ships (between 101 and 299 passengers) carried 4,206 passengers in 40 trips, and the large ones (more than 300 passengers) made 9 trips with 5,185 passengers.

	Ship occupancy ranged between 60% and 97%. Most journeys lasted 13 days, showing a wide variation between 10 to 21 days.

    • Trips were longer on average in 2000-01 (up from 12 in 1999-2000 to 13 nights in 2000-01) and occupancy, for all classes of ships increased from 74 % in 1999-2000 to 81% this season.

    • As regards nationalities, the majority of the Antarctic passengers recorded were  from United States of America, representing 45% of the total visitors to Antarctica through the Port of Ushuaia. 

    • Tourist activities were carried out in 113 sites, mainly in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. 908 visits were recorded, with nearly half of these visits (45%) concentrated in only 10 sites.

    • Landings by small boat and zodiac cruising were by far the two most common activities.  As same as last season, 'non conventional' activities were carried out, becoming more popular every year, as camping, scuba diving, kayaking, climbing, extended walks, walking on fast ice, helicopter flights and marathon.
Transit of ships and passengers through the port of Ushuaia

The 2001-02 Antarctic season started on November 8th., 2001 and ended on March 17th.,  2002. During this period, 15 cruise ships called at the Port of Ushuaia, making a total of 107 trips.

To analyze the flow of vessels and passengers which visited the Antarctic region using Ushuaia as a port of departure, transit and/or return, the journeys and consequently the passengers, have been classified into three categories:
    • LOCALS: Those journeys that started AND ended in Ushuaia. This means that passengers went through Ushuaia twice: when they embarked for departure and when they disembarked on return.  
    • SEMI-LOCALS: Those journeys that started OR ended in Ushuaia, alternating with another port. This means that passengers went through Ushuaia only once: on departure when they embarked, or on return when they disembarked.
    • IN TRANSIT: Those journeys that Neither started Nor ended in Ushuaia, but made a stopover at this port when going or coming from Antarctica. This means that passengers went through Ushuaia once, having started and ended the journey in other port(s). 

 Numbers for each category are shown in Table1.

From the total of journeys made through the Port of Ushuaia, there were 78 local trips representing a 73% for those voyages that started and ended in Ushuaia. The semi-local  trips were 27, a 25% for those journeys that started or ended at the local Port. After 6 consecutive seasons, 2 in transit voyages were made during the 2001-02, recording a little proportion of 2%. 

Comparative analysis of ‘local’, ‘semi- local’ and  ‘in transit’ journeys with previous seasons

   (*) The number of journeys is indicated in brackets.

Table 2 shows that, during 2001-02 season the percentages of local trips reached the 73%, showing a slight decrease according to the two previous seasons. 

Semi-local trips represents the 25% of the total amount of journeys, and the remaining 2% is showed for in transit trips,  a category of voyage not seen since last 6 past seasons through Ushuaia.

The decreasing 4% figure showed for local trips, was absorbed by the other two categories. It means that Tour Operator companies are trying other South American ports in a small proportion without changing their trend on considering Ushuaia their Gateway for Antarctic Tourism season.   

The higher percentages for local and semi-local journeys indicate that tour operators still have a preference for the Port of Ushuaia as the most important operational center of Antarctic cruise ships. 

Comparative analysis of sea-borne antarctic tourism going through Ushuaia with world figures
 In Table 3 the flow of Antarctic tourists going through Ushuaia is compared with the world wide total of passengers that visited Antarctica by sea. The column “Ushuaia passengers” section is divided into ‘Total’ (number of tourist who went through Ushuaia at least once) and ‘Local’ (those who started and ended their journeys at Ushuaia). For both cases, the corresponding percentages against world figures are shown.

	Season 1998-99 to 2000-01: estimated by the Antarctic Unit , taking into account the information given by IAATO. Sailing ships and airborne tourism are not included. 
   
According to the preliminary information provided by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) at the beginning of the season, the Antarctic Unit of The Tourism Board of Tierra del Fuego estimated a total of 13,465 Antarctic ship-borne passengers. From this total number of passengers, 12,886 went through the local port at least once. This means that  95 % of the passengers called at the Port of Ushuaia to visit Antarctica by sea.

  The world-wide increase of Antarctic sea-borne tourism in the last ten seasons and a parallel growth of Ushuaia as the “Gateway to Antarctica”, being the most active gateway for the last seven seasons, is shown on the following bar chart: 




Comparative Analysis with previous seasons
During the present 2001-02 season an increase was recorded in the number of passengers that  visited Antarctica through the Port of Ushuaia, being even more than the total for world passengers figure for last season. However, this growth has no comparison with the number of trips made, though there was a little increase.

 The number of trips was up 1% from the 2000-01 season (106 vs. 107 journeys), while the number of passengers reached up 9% (11,489 to 12,886 passengers). 

It should be considered that, against the position taken during 1999-2000 season with the operation of 'MS Rotterdam VI', this Antarctic Unit decided to include in the present paper the two voyages made by 'MS Ryndam' to the Antarctic Peninsula. This decision respond to a possible trend in future seasons, due to the permission given to large cruise ship companies to visit the Antarctic area, without making landings operations. 


 Table 4 shows the evolution of Antarctic tourism through the port of Ushuaia during the last ten seasons, taking into account the total number of journeys and passengers. The corresponding percentage variations in relation to the previous year are also included.

Characteristics of the journeys and the passengers
According to the vessels passenger capacity, the cruise ships involved in the 2001-02 season are classified into three groups: 
    • Small: up to 100 passengers 
    • Medium: between 101 and 299 passengers
    • Large: 300 or more passengers

 Table 5 shows the characteristics of the journeys made by the 15 vessels operated through the port of Ushuaia. It is indicated for each vessel: the flag, the maximum passenger capacity, the percentage of average occupancy, the total number of journeys, the total number of passengers involved and the average duration of the journeys based on the night spent on board.

During 2001-02 season, 15 Antarctic tourism ships operated from the local port, under the following countries flag: 6 were from Russia, 5 from Bahamas, 1 from Liberia, 1 from Barbados, 1 from Netherlands and 1 from Panama. 

Regarding the ship classification mentioned above, 7 of the ships are with small ships, 5 of them are medium and the other 3  are large.

The maximum capacity of the vessels ranged between 46 and 1200 passengers. The small ships (up to 100 passengers) made 58 trips carrying 3,495 passengers, the medium ships (between 101 and 299 passengers) carried 4,206 passengers in 40 trips, and the large ships (more than 300 passengers) made 9 trips with 5,185 passengers.

The percentage of average occupancy of the vessels ranged from  60% to 97%. Table 5  shows that small ships had a higher occupancy average in comparison with the other two categories of cruises. 
 
The average duration of the journeys was between 10 and 21 nights onboard, in most of  the cases. On Table 5  there is a noticeable difference between the particularly extended voyages made by 'MS Ryndam' (21 nights) versus a possible trend of 10-13 days extension for Antarctic journeys. The 'Ms Ryndam' special itinerary includes visits to the Antarctic Peninsula within its South American season.


 Table 6 compares the maximum average passenger capacity, the average occupancy of the ships and the average duration of the journey for the last ten seasons.

   (1)	The number of vessels is indicated in brackets.

The first column indicates that the operation of 2 more small vessels increased the offer, although in comparison with medium ships, these last ones had a better range in average  passengers capacity, even being coincidently 2 ships less than the other category. 

The percentage average of occupancy had another gradual growing, showing for the analized season a figure that resembles the highest percentages recorded during 96-97 and 97-98 seasons. 

The average duration of the journeys was 13 nights on board, showing a similar figure as previous seasons.

Nationalities of Antarctic passengers
The post visit report data also show the various nationalities of Antarctic passengers that traveled through Ushuaia during the 2001-02 season. Bar chart 2 shows that by far the most were North American, followed in decreasing proportion by passengers from Germany, Great Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan. It should be noted the missing information regarding passengers nationalities for 7 of its 9 voyages made on 'Kapitan Dranitsyn'  and 4 out of 10 voyages made on 'Professor Molchanov', due to unavailing reports, at the time this document was been processed. 

Figure 1 – Nationality of Antarctic Passengers



Sites visited in the Antarctic area

Annex II is a list of the sites visited by Antarctic tourist vessels during 2001-02 season. Only sites within the Antarctic Treaty Area are included in the list. Data for tourist visits to South Atlantic Sub-Antarctic areas are being analyzed by British Antarctic Survey.

    • Tourist activities were carried out in 113 sites, mainly in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands.

    • As same as in the previous season, the most commonly visited places were Whaler’s Bay (Deception Is.), Port Lockroy, HalfMoon Island, Pendulum Cove (Deception Is.), Cuverville Island, Neko Harbor, Jougla Point, Waterboat Point, Paulet Island, Paradise Bay. The total number of passengers that visited each site was considered for this selection. 

    • 908 visits were recorded, 406 of which took place in the 10 most visited sites, concentrating 45% of the total visits.

    • The most common activities were boat landings and zodiac cruising. Once more, non conventional activities are being carried out, such as kayaking, scuba diving, marathon and helicopter flights. 

    • In 42 sites, just one activity was performed, while in the remaining 71 more than one activity was undertaken. 

    • These activities, shown per site at Annex II, can be summarized as follows:

730 boat landings at 88 sites			10 camping events at 5 sites
254 zodiac cruises at 64 sites		10 helicopter flights at 8 sites
