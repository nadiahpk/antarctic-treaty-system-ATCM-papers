ANNUAL COMNAP MEETINGS AND EVENTS 
 
1. 
COMNAP has held two annual meetings since the St Petersburg ATCM XXIV in July 2001.  The 
XIII COMNAP meeting was held in Amsterdam on 21-24 August 2001 at the headquarters of The 
Netherlands Academy of Science and the XIV COMNAP meeting was held in Shanghai on 15-19 July 
2002 at the downtown Exhibition Centre.  In accordance with established practice, COMNAP held its 
Shanghai meeting in conjunction with the XXVII SCAR meeting.  The SCAR Executive continues to 
meet in conjunction with the COMNAP “odd year” meetings (2001in Amsterdam) and this arrangement 
facilitates joint COMNAP/SCAR Executive meetings and helps consolidate ongoing cooperation between 
the Antarctic scientific and program management communities. 
 
2. 
The Tenth SCALOP “Symposium on Antarctic Logistics and Operations” was held over two days 
during the Shanghai COMNAP meeting.  In keeping with past practice, a Technical Exhibition was 
staged in parallel with the Symposium allowing the participation of suppliers of Antarctic-related goods 
and services.  Some 14 papers and 27 poster presentations were given at the Symposium.  The key topics 
focussed on: 
• 
Antarctic Medical Support and Standards; 
• 
Selection and Recruitment Procedures; 
• 
Proven Technologies and Equipment for Field Camps and Intra-continental Air Networks 
(including Waste Management); 
• 
Recent Advances in Solid and Liquid Waste Management; 
• 
Alternative / Sustainable Energy; and 
• 
Shipping in Antarctic Waters. 
 
3. 
The XV COMNAP meeting will be held in Brest, France on 8-11 July 2003.  Following the 
recent implementation of structural changes in SCAR, the SCAR working group meetings and delegates 
meeting will be held approximately three months apart in future rather than “back to back” over a two-
week period.  To ensure continuing liaison between COMNAP and SCAR, the “even year” COMNAP 
meetings will be held in parallel with the SCAR one-week working group meetings.  Thus the XVI 
COMNAP meeting will be held with the XXVIII SCAR meeting in Bremen on 26-30 July 2004. 
 
 
ATCM/CEP RELATED TASKS 
 
“Worst Case” and “Less that Worst Case” Environmental Scenarios 
 
4. 
The XXIV ATCM in St Petersburg requested “COMNAP, in consultation with SCAR, to provide 
the following information in respect of national program operations, for the purpose of establishing limits 
on financial liability, compensation, and insurability. 
(a) “Worst case scenarios” for land-based and sea-based environmental emergencies in the 
Antarctic Treaty Area including the probability of occurrence and estimated cost for 
responses action; 
(b) For the purposes of illustration, a range of scenarios less than worst case that might result 
in environmental impacts, including probability of occurrence and estimated cost of 
response actions; 
(c) Scenarios similar to those in (a) and (b) for which response action would not be 
possible.” 
 
3
5. 
COMNAP’s response is provided in a Working Paper to XXV ATCM that postulates a sea-based 
environmental disaster as the “worst case” scenario. Fourteen “less than worst case” scenarios are 
provided from an earlier COMNAP Working Paper (XXIII ATCM/WP14) of which six are identified 
where primary response actions would not be possible.  The paper notes the difficulty of estimating the 
probabilities and costs of incidents because of the relatively short history of Antarctic activities.  
Furthermore risk assessment for actuarial purposes is not within COMNAP’s area of competence. 
Nevertheless COMNAP will provide to the XXVI ATCM in Madrid with an additional paper of historical 
data on accidents that may assist in this process. 
 
 
Assessment of Environmental Incidents Arising from Activities in Antarctica 
 
6. 
In order to assist the ATCM in its deliberations on developing a Liability Annex to the 
Environmental Protocol, COMNAP was asked to prepare and present a paper to XXIII ATCM in Lima 
(June 1999) on an assessment of environmental incidents arising from activities in Antarctic.  An update 
of this paper was subsequently presented at XII SATCM in The Hague (September 2000).  At the XXIV 
ATCM in St Petersburg COMNAP was again requested to provide an updated paper to the XXV ATCM 
in Warsaw. 
 
7. 
The earlier two COMNAP papers were collated manually from data on incidents that was 
collected from national operators. In the case of the latest Working Paper it was decided to develop and 
implement a web-based process (password protected) that would enable national programs to enter details 
of incidents in a prescribed format and the process of extracting statistical reports was automated.  An 
extract from the web page on the new “Environmental Incident Reporting System” (EIRS) is given in 
Annex A to this report.  The Working Paper provided to XXV ATCM includes copies of the latest 
statistical reports downloaded from the web site.  The EIRS enables national operators to enter details of 
incidents soon after they have occurred updated statistical reports available within an hour of data input. 
 
 
Best Practice to Avoid Wastewater Disposal onto Ice-free Ground at Inland Stations 
 
8. 
An Inspection Report tabled at CEP IV in St Petersburg noted that several inland stations were 
discharging wastewater onto ice-free ground, which contravenes the provisions of Annex III of the 
Environmental Protocol.  The meeting asked COMNAP to “provide advice on how best practice might 
meet the requirements of the Waste Management Annex”. 
 
9. 
COMNAP has provided XXV ATCM with an Information Paper that summarises the results of a 
survey of national programs to determine current wastewater disposal practices.  The survey indicated 
that national programs use a wide variety of wastewater treatment systems including technologies that can 
produce effluent of drinking water quality although such systems have not yet been applied to inland 
stations on ice-free ground.  There are a number of technological developments that would have the 
potential to complement existing wastewater disposal practices. 
 
An Analysis of Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs) 
 
10. 
COMNAP presented a Working Paper at CEP IV (XXIVATCM/WP20) on a proposed process to 
for analysing IEEs prepared for various Antarctic activities.  The activities selected were scientific core 
ice-drilling, station living facilities and fuel storage facilities.  The analysis was to be undertaken on 
behalf of COMNAP by its “Antarctic Environmental Officers Network” (AEON).  COMNAP has 
submitted an Information Paper to CEP V summarising the outcomes of this work. 
 
 
4
11. 
The IEEs for bulk storage facilities were rated as being the most complete by the review team, 
followed by scientific core ice-drilling and station living facilities.  With respect to the sample of IEEs 
examined it was concluded that some aspects of the IEE process were being done very well while other 
aspects could be improved.  It was noted that those IEEs prepared since 1999 all ranked at least an 
“acceptable” average total ranking.  COMNAP intends (through AEON) to continue its work on the 
practical aspects of the EIA process with a view towards contributing to a future second edition of the 
ATCM “EIA Guidelines”. 
 
 
The Interaction Between National Operators, Tourists and Tourism Operators 
 
12. 
In view of the proposed discussion on tourism matters at the XXV ATCM, COMNAP has 
submitted and Information Paper based on the results of a members survey on the “Interaction between 
National Operators, Tourists and Tourism Operators”.  During the 2001/2002 season, some 9,300 tourists 
visited Antarctic stations.  Three stations, all in the Peninsula region, had 20 or more visits by tourists 
whereas four stations were visited only once.  A typical tourist visit to a station lasted three hours with an 
average of 67 persons per visit.  It is noted that some national programs are using tourist operations to 
supplement their logistics operations, albeit usually on a small scale. 
 
13. 
It is noted that contacts at a practical level, as demonstrated in the survey, between national 
operators and the portion of the tourist industry represented by IAATO, function in a very satisfactory 
way, largely because COMNAP and IAATO coordinate and exchange information with each other as 
they prepare and plan for the upcoming Antarctic season.  
 
14. 
COMNAP notes two issues of concern to national operators.  Firstly, adventure tourism usually 
involves a high safety risk but low environmental impact and cannot usually be regulated under the 
domestic legal environmental frameworks that Parties have enacted to implement the requirements of the 
Madrid Protocol.  This can result in inadequate contingency planning or lack of insurance to reimburse 
national operators for emergency search and rescue costs.  Secondly, with moves to increase inter-
continental air access to Antarctica there is a risk that this may open up more opportunities for air-based 
tourist activities. 
 
 
Proposed Antarctic Shipping Guidelines 
 
15. 
A report on the “Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Guidelines for Antarctic Shipping and 
Related Activities” hosted in London in April 2000 was presented by the United Kingdom to XXIV 
ATCM in St Petersburg.  The UK noted that the International Maritime Organsisation (IMO) was still to 
complete its consideration of a draft “Arctic shipping Guidelines” but the ATCM had already agreed to 
develop guidelines for Antarctic shipping.  The UK agreed to further progress consideration of the 
proposed “Antarctic Shipping Guidelines” by consulting on various issues with COMNAP, IAATO and 
other interested bodies. 
 
16. 
COMNAP has submitted an Information Paper to XXV ATCM outlining its response to the 
various questions raised in correspondence by the UK.  The basis for COMNAP’s response was with 
reference to the version of the IMO’s “Arctic Shipping Guidelines” that was available in January 2002.  
The COMNAP paper provides some background notes on the history of the proposed polar shipping 
guidelines and suggest possible amendments to the draft “Arctic shipping Guidelines” that could 
accommodate the needs of an “Antarctic shipping Guidelines”.

OTHER ACTIVITIES AND DEVELOPMENTS 
 
Sub-glacial Lakes Exploration 
 
17. 
  COMNAP I taking an active interest in the work currently being undertaken under the auspices 
of the SCAR Group of Specialists on Sub-glacial Lakes Exploration (SALE).  A number of national 
programs are expressing keen interest in contributing specialist expertise on particular aspects of the work 
and others are evaluating the technologies that may be applicable to ensuring that penetration of the lakes 
is environmentally sound.  COMNAP will continue to monitor progress and seek facilitate international 
partnerships for logistics and technical support, as appropriate. 
 
 
Antarctic Master Directory 
 
18. 
At the Tokyo meeting of the Joint COMNAP/SCAR Executives in July 2000, it was agreed that 
COMNAP and SCAR would contribute a total of US$40,000 per year for two years to support the 
development of the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) as a sub-directory of the NASA Global Change 
Master Directory (GCMD).  The COMNAP/SCAR Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management 
(JCADM) undertook to progress this work in conjunction with the GCMD. 
  
19. 
At the recent meeting of the Joint COMNAP/SCAR Executives in Shanghai (July 2002) JCADM 
briefed the committee on the progress achieved to date and confirmed that development of the system was 
essentially complete.  JCADM requested that US$20,000 per annum was needed to continue adding 
metadata entries to the site and maintaining the system.  This request is currently being evaluated by 
SCAR and COMNAP. 
 
 
Ship Position Reporting System (SPRS) 
 
20. 
In 2001 COMNAP developed a web-based (password protected) system that permits vessels to 
advise their position, heading by email to a site address and this data is automatically logged on the web 
site.  This “Ship Position Reporting System” (SPRS) was implemented just prior to the 2001/2002 season 
with six national programs participating in the system.  The design of the SPRS is consistent with the 
International Maritime Organisation’s guidelines for ship reporting systems.  Access to the processed 
information generated on the site is restricted to COMNAP member agencies and national maritime safety 
authorities that have responsibility for Search and Rescue operations in Antarctic waters 
 
21. 
At the Shanghai meeting, COMNAP agreed any vessel operating in Antarctic waters (including 
IAATO vessels) would be permitted to enter their position information on the site however such third 
party users would not be able to access the SPRS processed data on ship locations.  This policy is 
consistent with other international ship reporting systems.  Information on the SPRS (as appearing on the 
COMNAP web site) is given in Annex B. A sample SPRS report format is given at Annex C. 
 
 
Antarctic Medical Standards 
 
22. 
As a result of enhanced logistics capability there is an increasing degree movement of scientists 
and support personnel between national programs.  Often this transfer of personnel occurs at relatively 
short notice when personnel are already deployed in Antarctica.  In view of this increased mobility of 
personnel, there is a need to have a better understanding of the medical screening standards that are 
applied by each program. 
 
 
6
23. 
During the last year a survey of medical standards was undertaken and the results are being 
circulated to COMNAP member agencies.  An ad hoc working group of members has been formed to 
evaluate the results of the survey and determine what steps should be taken.  It has been suggested that a 
network be formed of operators and Antarctic medical practitioners to progress further work in this area. 
 
COMNAP INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 
24. 
During the last five years COMNAP has moved to communication systems that are almost totally 
email or web site based.  The only “hard copy” paperwork distributed to members are the annual 
amendments to the “Antarctic Flight Information Manual” (AFIM) which is produced in a standard 
format used by the aviation industry.   
 
25. 
Email communications are in the form of either “Notices”, “Messages” or “Newsletters”.   
“Notices” are used where there is an ACTION required by members by a specific date.   “Messages” 
provide information to members on COMNAP related activities but do not necessarily require an 
ACTION.   “Newsletters” are typically issued one or two times per month and largely depend on the 
receipt of news items from members.  The number of Notices, Messages and Newsletters issued during 
recent years are given in the table below.

26. 
The COMNAP web site has undergone considerable development during the last five years and 
now provides members with various inter-active systems and a vast amount of reference information.  
Approximately 1,700 documents, 190 views and 70 forms are contained on the site. The site’s 
Publications page (Annex D) provides copies of various COMNAP and ATCM documents that are 
available to the general public for downloading.  
 
27. 
A copy of the “Members” page of the web site is provided at Annex E and illustrates the range of 
facilities available that include: 
 
• 
The “Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual” (ATOM); 
• 
A concise version of ATOM known as MiniAtom; 
• 
Advance exchange of Operational Information; 
• 
Papers for Upcoming Meetings; 
• 
Papers from Past Meetings; 
• 
Notices, Messages and Newsletters; 
• 
The “Antarctic Environmental Officers Network” (AEON) page; 
• 
“Accidents, Incidents and Near Miss Reporting” (AINMR) System; 
• 
“Environmental Incident Reporting System” (EIRS); and 
• 
“Ship Position Reporting System” (SPRS). 
 
28. 
During the next twelve months it is intended to develop a page for COMNAP’s “Energy 
Management Network” (ENMANET) that will incorporate information on alternative energy systems 
used at various stations throughout Antarctica.  The web site will undoubtedly continue to evolve to meet 
the needs of members and inform the general public about Antarctic and national program activities.

This Environmental Incident Reporting System has been developed to provide both the
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCMs) and its Committee on Environmental
Protection (CEP) with up-to-date information on incidents that have occurred in
Antarctica since 1989 that may have resulted in environmental harm. The principal aim
of this data collection is to facilitate an assessment of the risks of environmental
emergencies arising in Antarctica in connection with scientific and operational activities.
The data also provides valuable input to assist discussions on developing the proposed
Liability Annex of the Madrid Protocol.
Each Antarctic program is requested to advise the COMNAP Secretariat of the person
who has been authorised to complete and submit Environmental Incident Reports. All
reports should be submitted within two weeks of the incident occurring, so that the
database and statistics are kept as up-to-date as possible.

Further background
The first request for Environmental Incident data was made to COMNAP under
Resolution 6 of the Tromso ATCM XXII in 1998. COMNAP Notice 175 was
subsequently issued to collect relevant data from national programs and the COMNAP's
Working Group on Monitoring the Liability Annex (MOLIBA) prepared a working
paper. This working paper, XXIII ATCM/WP16, was submitted to the Lima meetings
of the ATCM and CEP in May 1999.
The Lima ATCM/CEP requested COMNAP to provide an updated paper to the 2000
ATCM. COMNAP Notice 201 sought updated information from national operators and
a revised paper, XII SATCM/WP5, was submitted to The Hague ATCM/CEP in
September 2000.
The 2001 ATCM XXIV/CEP meetings in St Petersburg requested that the data again be
updated and provided to the 2002 ATCM XXV/CEP in Warsaw. In view of the ongoing

need for up-to-date information by the Antarctic Treaty System, MOLIBA requested that
a web page be developed that would enable national operators to enter data on
environmental incidents as they occur. Thus the data would be automatically updated to
provide summary reports to the ATCM/CEP upon request. In addition, the reports will
provide national operators with information that can assist in developing operational
strategies to enhance environmental protection and efficiency.

How it works
Participating vessels are provided with an email address, data format and password for
making updates.
When they wish to update their position (generally once a day), they send an email using
a format which includes the MMSI of the vessel (as a unique identifier), a password (for
authentication), and the current latitude and longitude of the vessel.
This email is received by a server which processes the information, and if it uses the

the public site. If the format is incorrect, a reply is sent to the sender with details of the
correct format.
After the update is made, the COMNAP liaison for the vessel's operator is sent a
confirmation email with details of the changes.
The vessels are then grouped by GRZ, and mapping software dynamically plots the
position of the vessels on the appropriate map for display on the site. Maps include a
timestamp to ensure that the most recent version is used.

Manuals and Handbooks 
COMNAP publishes and maintains an Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM) and an 
Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM) that contain detailed operational 
information for the use of national operators and other authorised personnel. These 
documents are not available for download on the public site; members may download ATOM 
once logged in. 
 
In addition COMNAP publish handbooks, from time to time, that provide national operators 
with guidance in specialist fields of activity. Some of these publications may be produced by, 
or in conjunction with other Antarctic organisations.

Symposia Proceedings 
COMNAP's Standing Committee on Antarctic Operations and Logistics (SCALOP) are now 
held every two years in conjunction with annual meetings of COMNAP. The proceedings 
have been prepared and published by the host members ever since the Fourth Symposium 
was held in Brazil during 1990. The general public cannot purchase copies of the proceeding 
but reference copies are usually held in the libraries of COMNAP member agencies. 
Proceedings have been published for the following Symposia: 
 
l
Fourth Symposium - Sao Paulo, Brazil, 1990  
l
Fifth Symposium - Bariloche, Argentina, 1992  
l
Sixth Symposium - Rome, Italy, 1994  
l
Seventh Symposium - Cambridge, UK, 1996  
l
Eighth Symposium - Concepcion, Chile, 1998  
l
Ninth Symposium - Tokyo, Japan, 2000  
 
Workshop Proceedings 
Workshops are convened to consider specific topics of current interest and priority. The 
proceedings are usually prepared and published by the host national operating agency. 
Workshops held by COMNAP and SCALOP include: 
 
l
Environmental Impact Assessment Workshop (Bologna, Italy, 1991)  
l
Oversnow Traverse Workshop (Washington DC, USA, 1994)  
l
Air Transport Networks Workshop (Washington DC, USA, 1995)  
l
East Antarctic Air Network Workshop (Tokyo, Japan, 1998) 
 
At ATCM XVIII, in April 1994, COMNAP and SCAR offered to convene workshops to 
address the environmental monitoring requirements specified in the Madrid Protocol. Two 
workshops were convened: 
 
l
Workshop on the Prioritisation of Impacts and the Development of Monitoring 
Options (Oslo, Norway, October 1995)  
l
Workshop on the Practical Design and Implementation of Environmental Monitoring 
Programs (College Station, Texas, USA, March 1996) 
 
A report on the proceedings and outcomes of the workshops were published and are available 
for download. 
 
AEON Reports 
The Antarctic Environmental Officers Network (AEON) was established in 1996 
and undertakes specific tasks on behalf of COMNAP. The following reports and proceedings 
have been produced by AEON: 
 
 
  
Report on Monitoring of Environmental Impacts from Science and 
Operations in Antarctica (July 1996) 
(PDF: 559 KB / 135 pages) 
  
AEON Workshop Report on Environmental Monitoring and 
Environmental Impact Assessment (September 1999)

Reports to ATCM 
COMNAP has presented annual reports to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings since 
its participation at XVI ATCM in 1991. In accordance with Recommendation XIII-2 an 
agenda item on "Operations of the Antarctic Treaty System: Reports" is regularly included in 
the ATCM agenda.  
 
In addition, COMNAP prepares working and information papers in response to specific 
requests, decisions or resolutions of the ATCMs. National operators have collected vast 
databases of information on all aspects of Antarctic operations that may be used to assist 
policy formulation.
