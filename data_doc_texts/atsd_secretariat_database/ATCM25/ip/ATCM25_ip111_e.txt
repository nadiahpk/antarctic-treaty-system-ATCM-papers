* Signed for the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on 11 September 1980 and instrument of ratification deposited for the USSR on 26 May 1981.  Russia is the continuation State of the USSR (Russian MFA no. 11/UGP of 13 January 1992). See also Note 3B. 
1. The instrument of ratification of the Argentine Republic contained the following: 
"La República Argentina adhiere expresamente a la Declaración interpretativa efectuada por el señor Presidente de la Conferencia el 19 de mayo de 1980 e incluída en el Acta Final de la Conferencia y deja constancia que nada de lo establecido en esta Convención afecta o menoscaba sus derechos de soberanía y de jurisdicción marítima en las áreas bajo dicha soberanía dentro del área de aplicación definida por el artículo I.1. de esta Convención." 
of which an unofficial English translation reads as follows: 
"The Argentine Republic adheres expressly to the interpretative Declaration made by the President of the Conference on 19 May 1980 and included in the Final Act of the Conference and records that nothing contained in this Convention affects or impairs its rights of sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction in the areas under its said sovereignty within the area of application defined in Article I(1) of this Convention." 
2. The instrument of ratification of the French Republic included the following: 
"Declarons qu'elle est acceptée, ratifiée et confirmée et promettons qu'elle sera inviolablement observée sous les réserves et déclarations suivantes: 
Le Gouvernement de la République Française confirme son intention de considérer l'application des dispositions de la Convention sur la Conservation de la Faune et de la Flore Marines de l'Antarctique aux eaux adjacentes à Kerguelen et Crozet à la lumière des précisions fournies par la déclaration effectuée le 19 mai 1980 par le président de la Conférence, adoptée sans objection et annexée à l'Acte Final et déclare, qu'à ses yeux, les deux instruments ne peuvent être interprétés indépendamment l'un de l'autre." 
of which an unofficial English translation reads as follows: 
"We declare that the Convention is accepted, ratified and confirmed and we promise that it will be inviolably observed subject to the following reservations and statements: 
The Government of the French Republic confirms its intention to consider the application of the provisions of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to the waters adjacent to Kerguelen and Crozet in the light of the clarification given in the declaration made on 19 May 1980 by the Chairman of the Conference, which was adopted without objection and annexed to the Final Act and declares, that in the view of the French Government, the two instruments cannot be interpreted independently of each other." 
3A. In communications in German and English accompanying its instrument of ratification, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany declared in the German language as follows: 
"ich beehre mich, im Namen der Regierung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland im Zusammenhang mit der heutigen Hinterlegung der Ratifikationsurkunde zum Übereinkommen vom 20. Mai 1980 über die Erhaltung der lebenden Meeresschätze der Antarktis zu erklären, daß das Übereinkommen mit Wirkung von dem Tage, an dem es für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland in Kraft treten wird, auch für Berlin (West) gilt." 
and in English as follows: 
"In connexion with the deposit today of the instrument of ratification to the Convention of the twentieth day of May 1980 concerning the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, I have the honour to declare on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that the said Convention shall apply to Berlin (West) with effect from the date on which it enters into force for the Federal Republic of Germany." 
3B. In a note dated 27 September 1982 received on 29 September 1982 the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, conveyed the following: 
"The declaration of the FRG concerning the application of the Convention to West Berlin is illegal. This Convention is linked to the Antarctic Treaty and contains direct references to it (Preamble, Articles III, IV, V, IX, XIII of the Convention). Meanwhile, the Antarctic Treaty directly involves the questions of security and status and is therefore one of the international treaties and agreements which the FRG, as it is clearly stated in the Quadripartite Treaty of 3 September 1971, has no right to apply to West Berlin. This point of view of the Soviet side was brought by the Government of the United States in its quality of Depositary of the Treaty to attention of all its parties on 6 August 1979. 
Besides, the Convention itself contains a number of Articles which also directly involve the questions of status (Articles VIII, XI, XXIV). 
Taking all this into consideration the Soviet side regards the declaration of the FRG concerning the application of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to West Berlin as contradictory to the Quadripartite Treaty of 3 September 1971 and therefore invalid." 
3C. In a note of 22 March 1983 the Embassy of the French Republic, Canberra, conveyed the following declaration on on behalf of the Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America (in relation to the declaration made by the Soviet Union received on 29 September 1982): 
"- Dans une communication au Gouvernement de l'URSS qui fait partie intégrante (annexe IV A) de l'accord quadripartite du 3 septembre 1971, les Gouvernements de France, du Royaume-Uni et des Etats-Unis ont confirmé que, à condition que les questions de sécurité et de statut ne soient pas affectées et que l'extension soit précisée dans chaque cas, les accords et arrangements internationaux auxquels la République Fédérale d'Allemagne devient partie, peuvent être étendus aux secteurs occidentaux de Berlin conformément aux procédures établies. Pour sa part le Gouvernement de l'URSS dans une communication aux trois Puissances qui fait également partie intégrante (annexe IV B) de l'accord quadripartite du 3 septembre 1971, a affirmé qu'il ne souleverait pas d'objection contre une telle extension. 
- Les procédures établies auxquelles il est fait référence ci-dessus et qui ont été confirmées par l'accord quadripartite, sont destinées inter alia, à donner aux autorités des trois Puissances la possibilité de garantir que les accords et arrangements internationaux auxquels la République Fédérale d'Allemagne devient partie et qui doivent être étendus aux secteurs occidentaux de Berlin le sont de telle manière que les questions de sécurité et de statut ne soient pas affectées. 
- En autorisant l'extension de la Convention mentionnée ci-dessus aux secteurs occidentaux de Berlin, les autorités des trois Puissances ont pris les dispositions nécessaires pour garantir que les questions de sécurité et de statut ne sont pas affectées. En conséquence, la validité de la déclaration de Berlin faite par la République Fédérale d'Allemagne conformément aux procédures établies n'est pas affectée et la Convention continue de s'appliquer pleinement aux secteurs occidentaux de Berlin et d'y produire tous ses effets. 
- La note Soviétique se réfère également à l'extension aux secteurs occidentaux de Berlin du Traité de l'Antarctique. A cet égard, les trois Puissances souhaitent appeler à nouveau l'attention sur la note du Département d'Etat des Etats-Unis du 21 Août 1980 diffusée par le Département d'Etat dans sa note du 12 janvier 1981." 
of which an unofficial English translation follows: 
"- In a communication to the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is an integral part (annex IV A) of the quadripartite agreement of 3 september 1971, the Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States confirmed that, provided that matters of security and status are not affected and provided that the extension is specified in each case, international agreements and arrangements entered into by the Federal Republic of Germany may be extended to the western sectors of Berlin in accordance with established procedures. For its part, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in a communication to the Governments of the three powers which is similarly an integral part (annex IV B) of the quadripartite agreement of 3 September 1971, affirmed that it would raise no objection to such extension. 
- The established procedures referred to above, which were endorsed in the quadripartite agreement, are designed inter alia to afford the authorities of the three powers the opportunity to ensure that international agreements and arrangements entered into by Federal Republic of Germany which are to be extended to the western sectors of Berlin are extended in such a way that matters of security and status are not affected. 
- When authorizing the extension of the above-mentioned convention to the western sectors of Berlin, the authorities of the three powers took such steps as were necessary to ensure that matters of security and status were not affected. Accordingly, the validity of the Berlin declaration made by the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with established procedures is unaffected and the application of the convention to the western sectors of Berlin continues in full force and effect. 
- The Soviet note also refers to the extension of the Antarctic Treaty to the western sectors of Berlin. In this connection, the three powers wish to recall the United States Department of State's note of 21 August 1980, which was circulated by the Department of State with its note of 12 January 1981." 
3D. In a note dated 30 March 1983 the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, Canberra, conveyed the following on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany in relation to the declaration made by the Soviet Union received on 29 September 1982 on the extension to the western sectors of Berlin of the Convention: 
"With note No. 30 dated March 22, 1983, of the Embassy of France in Canberra the Government of France replied to the assertion made in the communication referred to above. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the basis of the legal situation set out in the note No. 30 of the Embassy of France in Canberra wishes to confirm that the application to Berlin (West) of the aforementioned convention extended by it under the established procedures continues in full force and effect. 
The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany wishes to point out that the absence of a response to further communication of a similar nature should not be taken to imply any change of its position in this matter." 
4. The Convention was signed for the German Democratic Republic (GDR) on 11 September 1980 and an instrument of approval was deposited on 30 March 1982. The GDR acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. 
5. In its instrument dated 23 February 1994 and deposited 22 April 1994, the Government of Ukraine informed that: 
" ... at the 4th February 1994 Verkhova Rada of Ukraine adopted the resolution provided to succeed Ukraine to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources as one of the states-members of former USSR." 
A Note from the British High Commission, Canberra, dated 27 June 1994 and deposited 1 July 1994, stated, inter alia: 
"The United Kingdom welcomes the adherence of Ukraine to the Convention, but in view of the nature of the Convention, and in particular the provisions of Article XXIX(1) and Article VII(2)(b) and (d), the United Kingdom regards the Ukrainian Note as an instrument of accession." 
A Note from the Embassy of the United States of America, Canberra, dated 5 July 1994 and deposited 6 July 1994, stated, inter alia: 
"The Embassy wishes to inform ... that the Government of the United States of America welcomes the participation of Ukraine in CCAMLR. Based on Ukraine's accession to the Convention ... " 
A Note from the Royal Norwegian Embassy, Canberra, dated 2 August 1994 and deposited 3 August 1994, stated, inter alia: 
"The Norwegian Government welcomes the participation of Ukraine in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and considers the Ukrainian note of 22 April 1994 as a formal notification of accession in accordance with Article XXIX(1) of the said Convention." 
A Note from the Embassy of Sweden, Canberra, dated 23 September 1994 and deposited 26 September 1994, stated, inter alia: 
"Sweden welcomes the participation of Ukraine in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The Ukrainian note of 22 April, 1994 is regarded as a notification of accession in accordance with Article XXIX(1) of the Convention ... " 
A Note from the Embassy of Finland, Canberra, dated 28 October 1994 and deposited on the same date, referred, inter alia, to:
