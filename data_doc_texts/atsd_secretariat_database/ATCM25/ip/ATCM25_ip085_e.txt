REGULATORY MECHANISMS THAT ADDRESS ANTARCTIC TOURISM

Submitted by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators
(IAATO)

Numerous legal mechanisms exist to address activities of all human presence in Antarctica, enacted either by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, by mainly marine legislation that applies to virtually all ships at sea, or by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991).   The Protocol, in particular, folded many of the earlier regulations into its Articles and Annexes, thus strengthening the mechanisms now applicable to everyone who visits Antarctica, whether in the science community, support for science, or tourism.  IAATO has adopted these regulatory mechanisms as they materialized, and in some cases, practiced them before respective Treaty regulations came into force.  For example, tour operators and their passengers practiced a ‘Code of Environmental Conduct’ prior to the existence of IAATO in 1991, a ‘Code’ that is now in force as Recommendation XVIII-1 (1994) (see below).

All tourists on IAATO member expeditions, whether a citizen of a Treaty signatory of the Protocol or not, are obligated to observe requirements of their native country by virtue of national legislation enacted as a result of ratification of the Protocol; or subject to requirements of the country in which the tour operator is based.

Many of these regulations and related legal mechanisms that apply to human presence in Antarctica are listed below.  Most, if not all are applicable to tourism, and if so, are adhered to closely for IAATO-member activities.   The primary source for regulatory mechanisms enacted by Treaty Parties (Appendix 1) is “Polar Updates: Antarctica 2002/2003”, compiled and copyrighted by Poles Apart.”  The latter also provided the section on “Air Regulations”, as aircraft activity is a vital component of not only Treaty Party logistics, but also IAATO members.  Appendix 1 includes regulations of 14 Treaty Parties, including those in which tour operators are currently located.  Also included are regulations for some sub-Antarctic islands, which are commonly included in the itineraries of tour vessels visiting Antarctica, and are listed here for completeness. Note that this is a work in progress and will be updated as needed.

Sections on Marine Regulations, Station Visit Guidelines and those initiated by IAATO as operative documents complete the list.

Readers are encouraged to forward additional information to the IAATO Secretariat that might have been omitted and can be included in this list; succeeding regulations and amendments might also materialize in the future.

The convention was subsequently modified by a Protocol passed in 1978 and is known as MARPOL 73/78. IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MPEC) regularly reviews the provisions of the convention
    • Resolution MEPC.42(30) (entered into force 1992): Designation of the Antarctic area as a “Special Area” under Annex I (Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil) and Annex V (Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage)
