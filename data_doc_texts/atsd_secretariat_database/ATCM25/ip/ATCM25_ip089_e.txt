JARE Marine Science Program Chartering a Research Vessel

National Institute of Polar Research, Japan


Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) is now carrying out its　5-year research program of phase VI (2001-2005).  The phase VI started in 2001, when the JARE-43rd left for Antarctica.  The first　attempt in the JAREs to perform marine science study by other research vessel than a multi-purpose big icebreaker, now Shirase, chartering a vessel　was successfully achieved by the JARE-43 members.

Main goal of the marine science cruise of the JARE-43 is to reveal　relationships between biological processes and global climate change.　To achieve this goal, the time series observations to cover the whole productive period were carried out.  After discussion among Japanese and Australian colleagues, RMV Aurora Australis (Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition) was the first to work in the area in October-December 2001, RV Hakuho Maru (Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo), the second in January 2002, the RV Tangaroa, chartered by the JARE, the third in February, followed by the Japanese icebreaker Shirase (JARE-43) in March.

Major core measurements, such as 1) primary production, 2) gas production processes, 3) variation of ecosystems and 4) carbon flux study, were repeated by the four vessels. The target area for this season was in and around the ice edge south of 61°S along 140 °E.  In addition to these observations, formation of the Antarctic bottom water was studied.
The chartered RV Tangaroa departed from Hobart in early February 2002. Underway observations were continued for sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, ADCP, XCTD/XBT, acoustic survey, continuous plankton recording and atomospheric CO2 analysis.  Station observations were started in mid-February at the southernmost station 8 (66 °26' S, 140°00' E).  The transect observation between Stations 8 and 1 (61°S, 140°E) finished in late February. During the transect observation, two moorings were successfully recovered, which were deployed by Shirase in March 2001 (JARE-42) and RV Hakuho Maru in January 2002. Almost the all observations planned, including three series of drifting buoy observations, were performed.  After the transect observation, the surface water observations were conducted again between 61°-66° 26'S along 140°E.  Station observations were conducted at several points, which were observed by RMV Aurora Australis and RV Hakuho Maru earlier.  All of the station observations were finished on the 2nd of March 2002, and RV Tangaroa returned to Hobart on 7th of March.

In the coming 2002/2003 season, JARE-44 will charter a research vessel again. The similar time series observation as the previous season will be carried out by four vessels. The RMV Aurora Australis and the T/V "Umitaka Maru", Tokyo University of Fisheries, plan research cruises in the same sea area as the JARE charter ship, in October - November 2002 and January - February 2003, respectively.  Shirase will steam through the area for  the oceanographic observation in March 2003.
