Port State Jurisdiction: An Appropriate International Law Mechanism To Regulate Vessels Engaged In Antarctic Tourism

Information Paper submitted by the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC)

Executive Summary

International law has recognized that port states may affirmatively take measures to inspect vessels visiting their waters and enforce internationally-recognized maritime standards for ship operations and other environmental rules.  Such port state regimes are in place in virtually every other part of the globe.  In order to provide an added element of enforcement of maritime standards and the provisions of the Madrid Protocol, merchant and tourist vessels, bound for the Antarctic Treaty Area, and calling at gateway ports, should be subject to inspection.  This Information Paper outlines the international law basis for a port state regime for the Antarctic and also proposes a draft Memorandum of Understanding on this subject (starting on page 7).


    I. Exclusive reliance on flag state jurisdiction is insufficient 

Over the last several decades, flag state control has become increasingly inadequate, resulting in the need for port states to exercise oversight and police their own waters for ships not operating in conformance with internationally-recognized maritime standards.1  In the 1970s and 80s, some ship owners turned to open registries, or “flags of convenience,” as a way of registering their vessels while avoiding burdensome regulation.  As a result, with the intention of tapping this free-flow of revenue, the number of states with open registers grew.2  Some states with open registers did not have, and continue to lack, the resources to oversee their own vessels and certainly did not have the ability to regulate foreign vessels registered under their flag.3  Further, even if flag states had the means to patrol ships flying their flag, these ships rarely returned to their ports of registration and thus were infrequently, if ever, inspected.4  The general condition of ships plying the world’s waters deteriorated severely as a consequence of these under-regulated ships.5  Only recently, through the increased use of port state control, has the world community begun to improve maritime standards6 and improve the standards of ships from all parts of the globe.7  Through various international agreements,8 port state control has demonstrated its value and success in monitoring ships and is now a recognized and accepted form of jurisdiction in international law.9  Port state control is here to stay.10

Under international law, port state jurisdiction complements flag state control.11  Port state control is an important instrument for certifying that a ship meets the technical or other requirements contained in international maritime conventions.12  Ideally,13 the first responsibility for ensuring that ships comply with national and applicable international agreements regulating a ship’s condition rests with the flag state.14  It is commonly understood in international law that only states party to a treaty are bound by it.  Therefore, states that have not ratified certain of the several maritime conventions setting out regulations for safety of human life at sea and protecting the environment need not abide by the rules defined therein.  However, regardless of the compelling argument that many of the rules laid out in these conventions have become so widely accepted by the international community that they could qualify as rules of customary international law, it is also generally recognized in international law that a ship voluntarily entering a foreign port accepts the jurisdiction of that foreign state.15  Port states may review the ship’s certificates issued by the flag state16 and conduct further investigation only upon “clear grounds.”17  If necessary, the port state may detain the foreign ship until any and all deficiencies are rectified and must notify the flag state through its representative or consulate.  Because all flag states are not party to the major safety and environmental maritime conventions, and on account of several flag states’ inability or disinclination to uphold the barest, minimum standards on ships flying their flags, substandard ships sailing the world have posed significant safety hazards to human life and pollution risks to the environment.  States invoke port state jurisdiction to protect their ports and territorial waters from the potential dangers of substandard ships.18  


    II. Port state jurisdiction: the legal basis

Port state jurisdiction is an essential tool for implementing and enforcing various international maritime conventions.19  Requirements for port state control have been delineated in several key maritime conventions and evolved over time to become more extensive and inclusive.  Relevant conventions include: International Convention on Load Lines, Article 21, 1966;20 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Chapter I, Regulation 19, 1974;21 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), Article 5(2), 1973/78;22 International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, Article X, 1978;23 and the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, Articles 218,24 219,25 and 226(1)(c)26 of 1982.27  Article 218 of the UN Law of the Sea Convention, accepted as customary international law, provides the most far-reaching application of port state jurisdiction and control over marine pollution standards by providing port states with the authority to investigate pollution violations wherever they occur.28  

In addition to the larger international conventions, regional Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) on port state control have sprung up around the world of which the Paris Memorandum of Understanding of 1982 is the original and continues to serve as a model for subsequent agreements.29  These memoranda were created for the purpose of protecting human life at sea and the marine environment by filling the void left by flag states.  Regional agreements that have been enacted include: Paris MOU on Port State Control, 1982; Viña del Mar Agreement, 1992 (Latin American Agreement on Port State Control); Tokyo MOU, 1993 (Asia-Pacific MOU on Port State Control in the Asia-Pacific Region); Caribbean MOU, 1996 (MOU on Port State Control in the Caribbean Region); Mediterranean MOU, 1997 (MOU on Port State Control for the Mediterranean Region); Indian Ocean MOU, 1998; and West and Central African MOU, 1998.  Through the memoranda on port state control a worldwide network continues to develop to aid in the exchange of information and facilitate the crackdown on substandard ships.30  

For a regional memorandum to succeed, every state in that particular area must accede to the agreement.  Less than full cooperation will result in the development of “ports of convenience,” much like “flags of convenience,” with delinquent ships avoiding ports with stricter standards in favor of those with more relaxed measures.31  The International Maritime Organization (IMO), committed to port state control,32 has been a rallying force behind the enactment of a global port state control system through the proliferation of several smaller, regional agreements.33  There has been some concern expressed by the Paris and Tokyo MOUs over the development and proliferation of newer agreements: namely, many of the more recent memoranda include as parties to the agreement states which have consistently and continuously appeared on the list of delinquent flag states.34  Regardless, a body of regional states working together35 through port state control offers the most promising means yet to oversee standards on ships.36


    III. Application to the Antarctic Context

In the past decade, tourism in Antarctica has increased substantially, and appears set to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.37  This poses a risk not only to the Antarctic environment and its value for scientific research, but puts additional strain on the limited Antarctic governance regime provided through the Antarctic Treaty System.

To date the Antarctic tourism industry has been effectively left to self-regulation through the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO).38  ASOC argues that this is an insufficient basis for managing a major industry in Antarctica, and that States Parties have a duty to develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms.39  This arises from the need to invoke considerations beyond immediate commercial interests in dealing with this ten percent of the planet as a global commons, and the fact that even at present, not all tourism activity is conducted within the framework of IAATO membership.40  

Compounded with this development is the unique situation wherein an increasing proportion of the tour operators in the region are from third party states, not bound by the Antarctic Treaty or Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection.41  Measures must be taken to protect the Antarctic environment and the values recognized therein, and to prevent accidents and threats to life and property. This means that a port state regime would have to be established to ensure not only that vessels are in compliance with internationally-recognized maritime standards for ship operations, but also that activities occurring in the Antarctic Treaty Area, which will be based on a vessel, are carried out in conformance with the specific environmental rules of the Madrid Protocol, and its annexes (both current and future), including the EIA provisions of Annex I and the specific prevention of marine pollution prevention provisions of Annex IV.

The challenge to managing tourism in Antarctica originates from the lack of effective jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty Area.42  In particular, states not party to the Antarctic Treaty or states that have not achieved consultative status (meaning the state has not yet invested appreciable resources into scientific endeavors on the continent to have a sizable interest) are not bound by the Treaty, or at least may not have ratified the subsequent Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol) of 1991.43  States free from any legal obligation under international law stemming from the Antarctic Treaty and Protocol may pursue tourist trade unregulated in the Antarctic.  The Antarctic Treaty intended to resolve the jurisdiction issue over individuals visiting the Antarctic,44 but, to date, this question remains unanswered.45  Furthermore, states with gateway ports serving Antarctica are unable to control tourist ships leaving for Antarctica by conventional means on account of a lack of jurisdiction because their ports are located outside the Antarctica area.46  

The problem here lies in the absence of adequate legislation in place to control Antarctic tourism.  Annex IV to the Protocol on Environmental Protection, 1991, is too permissive and does not set out firm means for regulating tourism in the region.47  The Protocol mentions tourism in three places, Articles 3(4),48 8(2),49 and 15(1)(a),50 but doesn’t specify how to enforce the rules.  There is, as yet, no legal basis for port state jurisdiction to be applied to Protocol Annex IV.51  The Protocol contains no internationally recognized certificate on the fulfillment of technical requirements and no uniform international document certifying the fulfillment of conduct obligations (such as, for example, MARPOL’s Oil Record Book in accordance with MARPOL, Annex I, Appendix III, 1973/78).  Under Annex IV, Articles 5(6) and 6(2) of the Protocol, use of garbage and sewage record books is merely an option that the parties may prescribe after considering their usefulness.  Some states party to both the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol have used Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty52 when enacting the Protocol in their domestic legislation so as to reach not only their nationals, but also foreigners leaving on expeditions to Antarctica originating in their country.53  States party to the Protocol can incorporate port state inspections through Article 13,54 which requires each state to take the necessary measures and adopt appropriate rules and regulations for compliance with the Protocol.55  

Two further provisions in Annex IV allow port state inspection.  Article 9(2)56 requires states parties with gateway ports to build facilities to hold sludge and other garbage of vessels departing to or arriving from the Antarctic Treaty area.57  Article 1458 stipulates that nothing in Annex IV will derogate from MARPOL 1973/78.59  MARPOL categorizes Antarctica as a “special area”60 and, under Annex I, Chapter I, Regulation 10(2)(a) and (3)(a), prohibits and/or restricts any discharge of oil or any oily mixture.61  Where breaches of Annex IV and MARPOL overlap, the port state that is a party to MARPOL could inspect the foreign ship.62  In addition, two major maritime conventions, International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) 1973/78 and International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974, are limited in breadth (to pollution principally from oil and the safety of humans, respectively) and thus cannot be used as a way to extend port state control to regulatory concerns in the Antarctic as raised in Protocol Annex IV.63  There needs to be standardized international regulations in place before port states can exercise jurisdiction over foreign vessels.64  The only possible solutions, absent self-regulation, which in ASOC’s view is not a viable alternative, rest in an additional annex to the 1991 Protocol or a memorandum of understanding on port state control between as many states parties as possible.65

The use of port state jurisdiction to oversee Antarctic tourism by regulating ships leaving “gateway ports” for Antarctica is not a great leap in application.  For that matter, Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty, already requires all parties destined for the Antarctic region to give advance notice – although states differ substantially in their interpretation of which expeditions are included.66  Port state jurisdiction is based upon a state’s authority to set conditions for entry to its ports.67  The key here is the fine line between ships which arrive in a foreign port having committed a violation of international maritime law or presently in breach because of the condition of the vessel, and ships that have not yet committed any violation, but will be in violation once in the Antarctic Treaty Area because they may not comply with the special environmental protections necessary for a voyage in the Antarctic.  Port state control thus would be applied in anticipation of future activities by vessels presently in a departure state’s port.

In the context of liability, it is interesting to note there is general agreement that port states have an important role to play in preventing accidents.68  Some states would even argue that port states should be held liable as well for accidents in the Antarctic caused by ships that last departed their ports.69  As a result, a strong argument can be made for the necessity of port states to inspect foreign vessels for compliance with international maritime agreements through port state control.70


    IV. An MOU, modeled on the Paris MOU, is the best approach for port state control in the Antarctic Treaty System

A memorandum of understanding modeled on the Paris MOU of 1982 is a viable means of implementing an effective port state control regime to regulate vessels engaged in Antarctic tourism.71  An Antarctic MOU on port state control would help enforce the Protocol, as well as other relevant maritime conventions.72  The concept of port state jurisdiction is not foreign in the Antarctic Treaty System.73  Several of the States party to the Antarctic Treaty are also signatories of the major maritime conventions, such as MARPOL, SOLAS, and the UN Law of the Sea Convention, wherein port state controls have been successfully invoked to uphold treaty provisions, and many are party to one or more of the existing MOUs.74  Because there are still states that are not party to all the maritime conventions, an alternative method is needed to reach the ships of these states so as to ensure their compliance with international maritime standards.75

The goal for managing Antarctic tourism should be an MOU on port state control76 where at least all states with gateway ports are parties.77  A departure state agreement laying down minimum standards to be met by all vessels and aircraft leaving for Antarctica from a gateway port must be formalized.  Unsurprisingly gateway ports are located in Southern hemisphere states which are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.  The key to the success of an MOU on port state control is the implementation of standardized regulations between state parties.78  But, it is one thing to have convention requirements, and entirely another thing to set out specific tools for enacting those standards.79  Port state control measures must be similar in every state party to the MOU.  Tourist ships traveling to the Antarctic must have a benchmark by which to structure their actions.  The requirements in each gateway port must be uniform so that tour operators can anticipate whether they are in compliance.  

To this end, regular, harmonized inspections should be carried out.80  Parties to the MOU should agree on a checklist to be shared by all inspectors.81  Qualified persons who are properly authorized should carry out inspections.82  Certificates should be issued both to tour operators and vessels that meet the approval of the port state.  Such certificates should be valid and recognized by other states party to the MOU on port state control for a period of time, not to exceed six months,83 wherein the vessel would not be subjected to further inspections, absent “clear grounds,”84 meaning prior notification by another authority or obvious violations.85  Unlike the Paris MOU, with its aim for each state party to inspect twenty-five percent of the vessels entering their ports in a given year, an MOU on port state control in the Antarctic should strive to achieve a 100% inspection rate.  The Antarctic region is highly vulnerable to environmental pollution and disturbance.  On account of the extreme conditions, the Antarctic region would take significantly longer to purge itself of the effects of an environmental incident.  Therefore, the port authority may detain a vessel failing its inspection until such time, and not any longer,86 as the problem is solved.87  Deficiencies must be rectified before a ship is allowed to leave port.  The flag state, through its consul or nearest diplomatic representative (maritime authority) must be notified immediately of any detention of its ships.88  Even military vessels and other State-owned vessels must take appropriate measures to ensure their ships are in compliance, particularly when they are engaged in commercial activities.89

	A comprehensive and continually updated database, shared by all the gateway ports is essential to a successful port state control program governing tourism in the Antarctic.90  Through the Internet, states party to an MOU on port state control can quickly and easily access information about tourist vessels in their ports to determine whether the ships are in good standing.  With gateway ports operating off the same page, all tour operations will be held accountable to the identical standards and it will not be as easy for ships in violation to slip by unchecked.91

States party to an MOU on port state control will not afford preferential treatment to ships flagged under states not a party to the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS).92  This principle factors in the application of present maritime conventions, such as MARPOL.93  Chile, for example, holds states not party to MARPOL to the same inspections as states parties.94  To do otherwise would in effect encourage states not to become a party to maritime conventions in an effort to avoid additional restrictions.

Port state control is widely used now to enforce important maritime conventions.  In addition, regional MOUs on port state control that have proliferated around the world employ this jurisdiction as a way to inspect any and all vessels entering their harbors for compliance with international maritime treaties.  It is not difficult to take a step further and to envisage an MOU on port state control among, at the very least, states with gateway ports to the Antarctic as a means of regulating Antarctic tourism in particular and enforcing the Protocol in general.  

To facilitate this logical extension, please find a draft Antarctic Memorandum of Understanding attached to this Information Paper.
Draft Antarctic Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control

Those countries with “gateway ports” to Antarctica; hereinafter referred to as “the Authorities”:

Recalling the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty of 1991 and, in particular, its restrictions on shipping in the Antarctic;

Bearing in mind the special legal and political status of Antarctica and the special responsibility of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to ensure that all activities in Antarctica are consistent with the purposes and principles of the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol;

Recalling the designation of Antarctica as a Special Conservation Area and other measures adopted under the Antarctic Treaty System to protect the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems;

Convinced that the development of a comprehensive regime for the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems is in the interest of humankind as a whole;

Desiring to supplement and reinforce the purpose of the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty so that it can meet evolving challenges to the Antarctic Treaty Area;

Mindful that the principal responsibility for the effective application of standards laid down in international instruments rests upon the authorities of the state whose flag a ship is entitled to fly;

Recognizing nevertheless that effective action by port states is required to prevent the operation of substandard ships;

Recognizing also the need to avoid distorting competition between ports and the need to ensure equal treatment of all participants;

Convinced of the necessity, for these purposes, of an improved and harmonized system of port state control and of strengthening co-operation and the exchange of information;

have reached the following understanding:

Section 1	Commitments

        1.1 Each Authority will give effect to the provisions of the present Memorandum and any Annexes thereto, which constitute an integral part of the Memorandum.
        1.2 Each Authority will maintain an effective system of port state control with a view to ensuring that, without discrimination as to flag, merchant ships and tourist vessels calling at a port of its state, or anchored off such a port, and bound for the Antarctic Treaty area, as defined by Article VII of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, comply with the standards laid down in the relevant instruments as defined in section 2.  Each Authority may also carry out controls on ships at off-shore installations.
        1.3 Each Authority will inspect annually all merchant ships and tourist vessels, hereinafter referred to as “ships,” which enter its ports and are bound for the Antarctic Treaty area.
        1.4 Each Authority will consult, cooperate and exchange information with the other Authorities in order to further the aims of the Memorandum.
        1.5 Each Authority, or any other body, as the case may be, will establish an appropriate procedure for pilot services and port authorities to immediately inform the competent Authority of the port state, whenever they learn in the course of their normal duties that there are deficiencies which may prejudice the safety of the ship, or which may pose a threat of harm to the marine environment.

Section 2	Relevant Instruments

        2.1 For the purposes of the Memorandum “relevant instruments” are the following instruments:
    • the Antarctic Treaty, 1959 (Antarctic Treaty);
    • the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 (LOAD LINES 66);
    • the Protocol of 1988 relating to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 (LL PROT 88);
    • the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 74);
    • the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS PROT 88);
    • the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78);
    • the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW 78);
    • the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREG 72);
    • the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (TONNAGE 69);
    • the Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, 1991 (Madrid Protocol 1991) and its Annexes
        2.2 Each Authority will apply those relevant instruments which are in force and to which its state is a party.  In the case of amendments to a relevant instrument, each Authority will apply those amendments which are in force and which its state has accepted.  An instrument so amended will then be deemed to be the “relevant instrument” for that Authority.
        2.3 In applying a relevant instrument, the Authorities will ensure that equal treatment is given to ships of parties and non-parties.  The Authorities will thereby apply the procedures specified in a future annex to this Memorandum.

Section 3	Inspection Procedures, Rectification and Detention

        3.1 In fulfilling their commitments, the Authorities will carry out inspections, which will consist of a visit on board a ship in order to check the certificates and documents referred to in a future annex.  Furthermore, the Authorities will satisfy themselves that the crew and the overall condition of the ship, including the engine room and accommodation and including hygienic conditions, meets generally accepted international rules and standards.  
In the absence of valid certificates or documents or if there are “clear grounds” for believing that the condition of a ship or of its equipment, or its crew does not substantially meet the requirements of a relevant instrument, a more detailed inspection will be carried out, as referred to in a future annex, or, as appropriate, an expanded inspection will be carried out as referred to in a future annex.  Examples of “clear grounds” are given in this same annex.
The Authorities will include control on compliance with on board operational requirements in their inspections.
        3.2 Nothing in these procedures will be construed as restricting the powers of the Authorities to take measures within their jurisdiction in respect of any matter to which the relevant instruments relate.
        3.3 The Authorities will seek to avoid inspecting ships which have been inspected by any of the other Authorities, under this Memorandum, within the previous six months, unless they have clear grounds for inspection.  The frequency of inspection does not apply to the ships exhibiting “clear grounds” for inspection in which case the Authorities will seek satisfaction whenever they deem this appropriate.
        3.4 Inspections will be carried out by properly qualified persons authorized for that purpose by the Authority concerned and acting under its responsibility, having regard in particular to a future annex laying out the minimum criteria for port state control officers.
When the required professional expertise cannot be provided by the Authority, the port state control officer of that Authority may be assisted by any person with the required expertise.  Port state control officers and the persons assisting them will have no commercial interest, either in the port of inspection or in the ships inspected, nor will port state control officers be employed by or undertake work on behalf on non-governmental organizations which issue statutory and classification certificates or which carry out the surveys necessary for the issue of those certificates to ships.
Each port state control officer will carry a personal document in the form of an identity card issued by his Authority in accordance with the national legislation, indicating that the port state control officer is authorized to carry out inspections.
            3.5.1 Each Authority will endeavor to secure the rectification of all deficiencies detected.  On the condition that all possible efforts have been made to rectify deficiencies, other than those referred to in 3.6.1, the ship may be allowed to proceed to a port where any such deficiencies can be rectified.
            3.5.2 In exceptional circumstances where, as a result of the initial control and a more detailed inspection, the overall condition of a ship and its equipment, also taking the crew and its living and working conditions into account, is found to be sub-standard, the Authority may suspend an inspection.
The suspension of the inspection may continue until the responsible parties have taken the steps necessary to ensure that the ship complies with the requirements of the relevant instruments.
Prior to suspending an inspection, the Authority must have recorded detainable deficiencies in the areas set out in a future annex, as appropriate.
In cases where the ship is detained and an inspection is suspended, the Authority will as soon as possible notify the responsible parties.  The notification will include information about the detention.  Furthermore, it will state that the inspection is suspended until the Authority has been informed that the ship complies with all relevant requirements.
            3.6.1 In the case of deficiencies which are clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment, the Authority will, except as provided in 3.7, ensure that the hazard is removed before the ship is allowed to proceed to the Antarctic Treaty Area.  For this purpose appropriate action will be taken, which may include detention or a formal prohibition of a ship to continue an operation due to established deficiencies which, individually or together, would render the continued operation hazardous.  A vessel operator’s non-compliance with the provisions of Annex I of the Madrid Protocol 1991 shall be considered a hazard within the meaning of this section.
            3.6.2 In the case of a detention, the Authority will immediately notify the flag state administration in writing, which includes the report of inspection specified in an annex to this Memorandum.  Likewise, the recognized organization which has issued the relevant certificates on behalf of the flag state administration will be notified where appropriate.  The parties above will also be notified in writing of the release of detention.
            3.6.3 Where the ground for a detention is the result of accidental damage suffered on the ship’s voyage to a port or during cargo operations, no detention order will be issued, provided that:
    • due account has been given to the requirements contained in Regulation I/11(c) of SOLAS 74 regarding notification of the flag state administration, the nominated surveyor or the recognized organization responsible for issuing the relevant certificate;
    • prior to entering a port or immediately after a damage has occurred, the master or shipowner has submitted to the port state control authority details on the circumstances of the accident and the damage suffered and information about the required notification of the flag state administration;
    • appropriate remedial action, to the satisfaction of the Authority, is being taken by the ship; and
    • the Authority has ensured, having been notified of the completion of the remedial action, that deficiencies which were clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment have been rectified.
            3.6.4 The following procedure is applicable in the absence of ISM certificates:
    • Where the inspection reveals that the copy of the Document of Compliance or the Safety Management Certificate issued in accordance with the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code) are missing on board a vessel to which the ISM Code is applicable at the date of inspection, the Authority will ensure that the vessel is detained.
    • Notwithstanding the absence of the documentation referred to immediately above, if the inspection finds no other deficiencies warranting detention the Authority may lift the detention order in order to avoid port congestion.  Whenever such a decision is taken, the Authority will immediately inform all other Authorities thereof.
    • The Authorities will take the measures necessary to ensure that all ships authorized to leave a port of their State under the circumstances referred to above will be refused access to any port within the states, the Authorities of which are signatories to the Memorandum, except in the situations referred to in 3.8.3, until the owner or operator of the vessel has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Authority in whose state detention was ordered, that the ship has valid certificates issued in accordance with the ISM Code.
        3.7 Where deficiencies which caused a detention as referred to in 3.6.1 cannot be remedied in the port of inspection, the Authority may allow the ship concerned to proceed to the nearest appropriate repair yard available, as chosen by the master and the Authority, provided that the conditions determined by the competent authority of the flag state and agreed by the Authority are complied with.  Such conditions, which may include discharging of cargo and/or temporary repairs, will ensure that the ship can proceed without risk to the safety and health of the passengers or crew, or risk to other ships, or without being an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment.
In such circumstances, the Authority will notify the competent authority of the region state where the next port of call of the ship is situated, the parties mentioned in 3.6.2 and any other authority as appropriate.  Notification to Authorities will be made in accordance a future annex on exchange of messages by region states.  The Authority receiving such notification will inform the notifying Authority of action taken.
            3.8.1 The Authorities will take measures to ensure that:
    a) ships referred to in 3.6.1 or 3.7 which proceed to sea without complying with the conditions by the Authority in the port of inspection; or
    b) ships referred to in 3.7 which refuse to comply with the applicable requirements of the relevant instruments by not calling into the indicated repair yard;
will be refused access to any port within the states, the Authorities of which are signatories of the Memorandum, until the owner or operator has provided evidence to the satisfaction of the Authority where the ship was found defective that the ship fully complies with all applicable requirements of the relevant instruments.
            3.8.2 In the circumstances referred to in 3.8.1.a, the Authority where the ship was found defective will immediately alert all other Authorities.
In the circumstances referred to in 3.8.1.b, the Authority in whose State the repair yard lies will immediately alert all other Authorities.
Before denying entry, the Authority may request consultations with the flag state administration of the ship concerned.
            3.8.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of 3.8.1, access to a specific port may be permitted by the relevant authority of that port state in the event of force majeure or overriding safety considerations, or to reduce or minimize the risk of pollution, provided that adequate measures to the satisfaction of the competent authority of such state have been implemented by the owner, the operator or the master of the ship to ensure safe entry.
        3.9 The provisions of 3.6.2 and 3.7 are without prejudice to the requirements of relevant instruments or procedures established by international organizations concerning notification and reporting procedures relating to port state control.
        3.10 The Authorities will ensure that, on the conclusion of an inspection, the master of the ship is provided with a document, in the form specified in a future annex, giving the results of the inspection and details of any action taken.
        3.11 Should any inspection referred to in 3.1 confirm or reveal deficiencies in relation to the requirements of a relevant instrument warranting the detention of a ship, all costs relating to the inspections in any normal accounting period will be covered by the shipowner or the operator or by his representative in the port state.
All costs relating to inspections carried out by the Authority under the provisions of 3.8.1 will be charged to the owner or the operator of the ship.
The detention will not be lifted until full payment has been made or a sufficient guarantee has been given for the reimbursement of the costs.
        3.12 The owner or the operator of a ship or his representative in the state concerned will have a right of appeal against a detention decision taken by the Authority of that state.  An appeal will not cause the detention to be suspended.  The Authority will properly inform the master of a ship of the right of appeal.
        3.13 Each Authority will, as a minimum, publish quarterly information concerning ships detained during the previous 3-month period and which have been detained more than once during the past 24 months.  The information published will include the following:
    • name of the ship;
    • name of the shipowner or the operator of the ship;
    • IMO number;
    • flag state
    • classification society, where relevant, and, if applicable, any other party which has issued certificates to such ship in accordance with the relevant instruments;
