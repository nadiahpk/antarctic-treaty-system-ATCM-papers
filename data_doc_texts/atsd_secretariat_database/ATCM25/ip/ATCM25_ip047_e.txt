        1.1 OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

1.1.1  NATIONAL EXPEDITIONS
	
A. STATIONS
COMANDANTE FERRAZ ANTARCTIC STATION (FERRAZ)
	A. The "Comandante Ferraz" Antarctic Station was constructed in Keller Peninsula, King George Island, on the 6th of February of 1984, to provide support to Brazilian scientific activities. Geographical co-ordinates of the Station, which is open all year round, are 62o 05'S and 058o 23.5'W. The Ferraz Station  has more than 60 modules, which can accommodate a Base-Group of 10 military of the Brazilian Navy, who stay there for a uninterrupted period of 12 months, 24 researchers, during the summer, and up to 10 researchers during the winter.
	There is a doctor available all year long, surgery room, infirmary, and x-ray equipment. Dental emergency services and laboratory analysis can be provided. The infirmary has two beds for treatments which require intensive care. In emergencies situations, it can accommodate up to 20 extra people during the summer and up to 6 extra people during the winter.

REFUGES
	Three Brazilian Antarctic refuges can provide accommodation facilities for 6 scientists working for a period of 40 days in locations far from the "Comandante Ferraz" Antarctic Station. The "Astrônomo Cruls" Antarctic Refuge was established during the summer of 1984-85. It is located on Nelson Island, on geographical co-ordinates 62o 14', 5 S and 058o 58', 8W. The "Padre Rambo" Antarctic Refuge was built during the summer of 1984/85. It is located on Fields Peninsula, King George Island, on geographical co-ordinates 62o 09,9'S and 058o 57,9'W. The "Emilio Goeldi" Antarctic Refuge was constructed during the summer of 1988-89. It is located on Elephant Island, on geographical co-ordinates 61o 05’S and 055o 20'W. When inspected in December of 2001, all three refuges were left in conditions to be used as shelters, but there was no first–aid kit, fuel or food in them.

        1.2 VISITATION TO PROTECTED ÁREAS

SSS18 – Western shore of the Admiralty Bay
At the present moment the PROANTAR Environmental Evaluation Group is considering a request for a Permit to implement activities of the project Distribution, Abundance and Biology of Birds in the Admiralty Bay, King George Island. The objectives are to identify and register the areas of reproduction in the Admiralty Bay,  count the number and species of birds and sea mammals in the area to be studied, map the distribution of birds and mammals and compare the data obtained with historical registers. The activities will be performed by 6 researchers starting November 13, 2002 and last until March 6, 2003, in the coastal region of the Admiralty Bay.
