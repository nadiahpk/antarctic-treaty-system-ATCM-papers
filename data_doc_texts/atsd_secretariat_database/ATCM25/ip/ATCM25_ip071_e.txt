 BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PUBLICATIONS BY STAFF NATURALISTS/LECTURERS INVOLVED IN TOUR ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA, 1991 – 2001

This paper is a compilation of publications by staff naturalists/lecturers who have been employed on tour vessels in Antarctica, and in aircraft operations in the interior.  The purpose of the bibliography is to illustrate the advantages of observations of wildlife and natural phenomena by paid staff naturalists on ‘ships of opportunity’ that reach remote parts of the continent.  The results contribute to the accumulation of scientific information about Antarctica, and can thus be of value to Treaty Parties and associated research programs.  This paper is not specifically about tourism, but includes that subject as well as entries of a scientific nature.  The accuracy of some of the citations is uncertain, because not all of original text was seen for compilation.

An initial survey of publications that resulted from these activities comprised a considerable list, which has since been abridged and consolidated into subject headings of known literature through May 2001 (a few published in 2002 are included), and with a starting date of 1991, the year that the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (1991) was formed. A complete bibliography of tourism in Antarctica is beyond the scope of this paper, and would be the subject of a different project.  A few entries with publication dates prior to 1991 are included because of their background value (e.g. Jehl and Todd 1985; Swithinbank 1988).  Criteria for listing include published literature pertaining to the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty (south of 60ºS), and which is easily accessible and available to the reader. Many of the entries are from sources involving peer review in refereed journals. Journalistic items (newspaper articles) have been excluded, as have unpublished reports and manuscripts.  Two examples of published testimony by a IAATO tourism representative for two legislative bills at the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate are also included.   The compilation is not exhaustive, as proved by an incomplete scan of literature and bibliographic sources, but represents a representative account of the productivity of numerous staff that is employed on tour vessels on a more or less continuing basis. Some staff has experience from numerous cruises on Antarctic tour vessels (as many as 100 or more cruises), and others are employed on an occasional basis with perhaps only a few cruises.   In addition, publications resulting from aircraft activities (e.g., Adventure Network International) are also included because the articles originated from staff involved in that feature of the industry.

Another category of inclusion is that of books, often for the lay reader, and on the subjects of wildlife, history, photography, and the like.  The entries here represent only those most directly related to staff appointments on tour vessels, and on subjects related to tourism and selected lecture topics.   Publications of this nature contribute to the public’s education about Antarctica, and people’s appreciation of the continent as a pristine and vulnerable part of the world that is subject to potentially damaging environmental impact.  

It is intended to maintain this bibliography on a continuous basis for the value it represents to both Treaty Party programs and their scientific projects, and as a partial record of tourism in general.   This initial compilation is likely to produce additional contributions from tour companies whose staff publications were overlooked earlier.  Contributions and suggestions are welcome, and should be addressed to the IAATO office (website: www.iaato.org).

Many of the books listed are available from ‘Longitude Books,’ 115 West 30th Street, Suite 1206, NY, NY 10001; www.longitudebooks.com.
