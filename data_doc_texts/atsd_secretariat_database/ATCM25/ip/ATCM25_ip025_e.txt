This paper describes results of the Antarctic Site Inventory project 
up to February 2002. The Antarctic Site Inventory has collected 
biological data and site-descriptive information in the Antarctic 
Peninsula since 1994, and is the only project collecting such data and 
information at a wide range of Peninsula sites. The project's 
methodology and results from previous field seasons have been described 
and discussed in XIX ATCM/INF 47, XX ATCM/INF 100, XX ATCM/INF 102, XXI 
ATCM/INF 114, and XXII ATCM/INF 27, XXIII/INF 32. 
Introduction. Following a year of examining methodologies and 
logistics, the Antarctic Site Inventory began fieldwork in November 
1994, intending to: 
• 
determine whether opportunistic visits can be used to 
effectively and economically detect possible visitor-
caused changes in the physical features, flora, and fauna 
of sites in the Antarctic Peninsula being visited 
repeatedly by ship-based tourists; 
• 
begin collecting baseline information necessary to detect 
possible changes in the physical and biological variables 
being monitored; and  
• 
determine how best to minimize or avoid possible 
environmental impacts of tourism and non-governmental 
activities in the Antarctic Peninsula area. 
Data collected by the Inventory are intended to assist the 
implementation of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
 
2
Antarctic Treaty, which, among other things, requires a priori 
environmental impact assessments for all human activities, including 
tourism, and for monitoring to be done, as and when necessary, to ensure 
that activities do not have unacceptable environmental impacts. There is 
a focus on the “initial environmental reference state” of particular 
locations, which in the case of tourism, would refer to places where 
shipboard passengers are visiting. 
The environmental concern is to identify changes to the baseline 
reference state and, if possible, determine whether any detected changes 
are naturally occurring or are anthropogenic, perhaps caused by tourism 
or other human activities. Potential impacts may be short-term or long-
term, immediate or cumulative. (Benninghoff and Bonner, 1985; Abbott and 
Benninghoff, 1990; SCAR, 1996; Emslie, 1997; Hofman and Jatko , 2002). 
Inventory field work is permitted under U.S. Antarctic Conservation 
Act Permit No. 2000-12, issued to Oceanites, Inc. for the period 
September 1, 1999 to August 31, 2004. 
Results. The Antarctic Site Inventory has demonstrated an ability to 
reach Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites frequently and cost-effectively, 
relying opportunistically on expedition tour vessels and the United 
Kingdom ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance for logistics support. Well-
timed visits by trained researchers have proved an effective means of 
characterizing sites and for collecting relevant biological data 
(Naveen, 1997a; Naveen, et. al, 2001). 
In the eight seasons from November 1994 to March 2002, the Inventory 
has made 416 visits to 76 Peninsula locations. There have been 
repetitive visits to all of the visitor sites that are most heavily 
visited by expedition tourists, and to all sites which exhibit the most 
species diversity and which are most prone to potential environmental 
disturbance from human visitors. (Naveen: 1997a, unpublished field data, 
1999-2002; Naveen, et. al, 2001) 
Logistics. Site visits are achieved by placing research teams aboard 
expedition vessels operating in the Peninsula during the austral spring 
and summer. With respect to penguins and flying birds, the focus is 
collecting data on breeding population size (nest counts) and breeding 
productivity (number of chicks per active nest), which are the 
appropriate biological parameters for detecting direct and cumulative 
 
3
impacts on these populations (Scientific Committee for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, 2001). 
Expedition ships are selected carefully, particularly those with: 
(a) the longest Peninsula itineraries (b) whose Initial Environmental 
Evaluations have been reviewed by national authorities; and (c) whose 
operations and expedition personnel enable Inventory researchers to 
reach the most heavily visited sites and to collect data at key census 
times (the peak of egg-laying for nest counts and the peak of chick-
crèching for chick counts). Site visits and aerial photodocumentation 
also have been undertaken in cooperation with HMS Endurance. (Naveen: 
1996, 1997a, 1999) 
At each site researchers attempt to identify and census prospective 
control colonies (i.e. those that are seldom disturbed) and experimental 
colonies (i.e. those that are frequently visited). The intent is to 
repeat regular censuses both near and far from landing beaches where 
visitors access a particular location. This will allow comparisons, over 
time, between areas where there are more and less human activity. 
For the approaching 2002-03 Antarctic field season, logistics already 
are in place for Inventory researchers to continue collecting data at 
previously visited sites and to gather data at new sites encountering 
tourist visits for the first time. The project also hopes to begin more 
focused assessment and monitoring at a few key sites that are heavily 
visited, diverse in species composition, and sensitive to potential 
environmental disruptions from visitors. 
Methodology. The Inventory’s methodology (fully described in Naveen: 
1996, 1997a) involves the collection of three categories of data and 
information: 
• 
Basic Site Information, which includes descriptions of 
key 
physical 
and 
topographical 
characteristics; 
latitude and longitude; distribution of flora, seal 
haul-out and wallow locations, and discrete groups of 
breeding penguins and flying birds; 
• 
Variable Site Information and Data, which includes 
weather and other environmental conditions (sea ice 
extent, cloud cover, snow cover, temperature, wind 
direction and speed), biological variables (number of 
 
4
occupied nests, number of chicks per occupied nest, 
ages of chicks), and the nature and extent of any 
observed 
visitor 
impacts 
(footprints 
or 
paths, 
cigarette butts, film canisters, and litter); and 
• 
Maps and Photodocumentation, which portray the major 
features of each site, particularly the locations of 
colonies and assemblages of resident fauna and flora. 
With respect to key biological variables, data collection follows 
Standard Methods established by the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program 
(CEMP) (Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine 
Living Resources, 2001). Data also are collected with reference to other 
pertinent authorities, in particular, The Distribution of Penguins on 
the Antarctic Peninsula and Islands of the Scotia Sea (Croxall, J. P. 
and E.D. Kirkwood, 1979) and The Distribution and Abundance of Antarctic 
and Subantarctic Penguins (Woehler, E.J., 1993). 
The Inventory divides the Antarctic Peninsula into six subareas: 
South Orkney Islands, including Laurie, Coronation, and Signy Islands 
(SO); Elephant Island and nearby islands (EI); Northeast Antarctic 
Peninsula/northwestern Weddell Sea (NE), from Cape Dubouzet (63°16’S  
64°00’W) to James Ross Island; South Shetland Islands, including 
Deception, Low, and Smith Islands (SH); Northwest Antarctic Peninsula 
(NW), from Cape Dubouzet (63°16’S  64°00’W) to north end of the Lemaire 
Channel; and Southwest Antarctic Peninsula (SW), from the north end of 
the Lemaire Channel to the northern part of Marguerite Bay (68°18’S 
67°11’W). 
Biological data and site descriptions collected by the inventory 
have been published and routinely made available in peer-reviewed 
papers, government reports, and popular publications (Naveen: 1996, 
1997a, 1997b; Naveen, et. al, 2000, 2001). 
Publications. Two reports relating to the project were published in 
1997: 
• 
Compendium of Antarctic Peninsula Visitor Sites: A Report 
to the Governments of the United States and the United 
Kingdom, US Department of State and UK Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office (Naveen, 1997a) 
 
5
• 
The Oceanites Site Guide to the Antarctic Peninsula, 
Oceanites, Inc., Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA (Naveen, 
1997b) 
The Compendium includes site descriptions, data on fauna and flora, 
orientation maps, and photographs of Antarctic Peninsula tourism sites, 
while the Site Guide provides a summary of this information that can be 
used readily by visitors, Antarctic tour operators, and expedition 
staff. The Site Guide is a popular version of these materials. 
Three peer-reviewed papers relating to Inventory field work appeared 
in 2000 and 2001: 
• 
Prevalence of Leucism in Pygoscelid Penguins of the 
Antarctic Peninsula, Waterbirds 23 (2): 283-285 (Forrest, 
S. and Naveen, R., 2000). 
• 
Censuses of penguin, blue-eyed shag, and southern giant 
petrel populations in the Antarctic Peninsula region, 
1994-2000, Polar Record 36 (199): 323-334 (Naveen, R., 
Forrest, S.C., Dagit, R.G., Blight, L.K., Trivelpiece, 
W.Z., and Trivelpiece, S.G., 2000). 
• 
Zodiac landings by tourist ships in the Antarctic 
Peninsula region, 1989-99, Polar Record 37 (201): 121-
132 (Naveen, R., Forrest, S.C., Dagit, R.G., Blight, 
L.K., Trivelpiece, W.Z., and Trivelpiece, S.G., 2001). 
The census paper (Naveen, et al., 2000) presents penguin, blue-eyed 
shag (Phalocrocorax atriceps), and southern giant petrel (Macronectes 
giganteus) population data collected between 1994-2000. Since 1994, the 
Inventory has detected declines in nesting populations of blue-eyed 
shags at five of its thirteen shag census sites; the declines are 
significant at three of these sites, two of which are either 
inaccessible to tourists or receive few tourist visits. These declines 
suggest that shag populations should be further monitored, and that 
their decline may be indicative of some underlying environmental 
change. 
The zodiac landings paper (Naveen, et al., 2001) examines the 
location, intensity, and frequency of zodiac landings by expedition tour 
ship passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula over ten seasons, 1989-90 
 
6
through 1998-99. In this period, the 25 most heavily visited Peninsula 
sites, by number of landings, were:

In this decade, the number of Peninsula zodiac landings per season 
increased more than 400%, from 164 to 858, concentrating in the South 
Shetland Islands (43.2% of all zodiac landings) and the northwestern 
part of the Peninsula (35.9% of all zodiac landings). The 10-20 
Peninsula sites with the most zodiac landings per season consistently 
account for 54-75% of each season’s landings and visitors.  
In each season, there are zodiac landings at previously unvisited 
sites. Assuming the 35 sites visited in the 1989-90 season as a 
baseline, 130 “new” sites have been added as zodiac landing sites from 
1990-91 through 1998-99, reaching a cumulative total of 165 sites. The 
 
7
rate of recruitment of “new” sites was highest during mid-decade 
(between 1994-95 and 1996-97), but is showing a declining trend.

From its inception, the Inventory has collected data regarding the 
presence or absence of nesting species of penguins and flying birds, 
wallows of southern elephant seals, and large patches or beds of 
lichens and mosses at all sites visited. These data are used to rank 
 
8
sites as to their species diversity, based on the number of faunal 
species and major floral groups recorded. Sites with “high” species 
diversity tallied 10 or more faunal species or major floral groups. 
Sites with “medium” species diversity tallied 5-9 faunal species or 
major floral groups. “Low” diversity sites tallied 0-4 faunal species 
or major floral groups. 
Five sites with high species diversity were identified: Hannah Point 
(SH), Penguin Island (SH), the Aitcho Islands (SH), Cuverville Island 
(NW), and Fort Point (SH). Fifteen sites with medium species diversity 
were identified: Arctowski Station (SH), Astrolabe Island (NW), Baily 
Head (SH), Brown Bluff (NE), Half Moon Island (SH), Heroína Island 
(NE), Port Lockroy (NW), Point Lookout (EI), Orne Island (NW), Paulet 
Island (NE), Petermann Island (SW), Pléneau Island (SW), Turret Point 
(SH), Whaler’s Bay (SH), and Yankee Harbor (SH). 
Using these presence/absence data as a base, sites also are ranked 
as to their potential sensitivity to disruption by visitors, depending 
on: (a) the number of penguin and seabird species whose nests visitors 
may access easily, (b) whether or not visitors may access southern 
elephant seal wallows easily, and (c) whether or not visitors may 
access easily and possibly trample large patches or beds of lichens and 
mosses. Sites with five 5 or more tallies were considered to be 
“highly” sensitive to potential disturbances by visitors; sites with 3-
4 tallies were considered to be “moderately” sensitive; and sites with 
0-2 tallies were considered to have “low” sensitivity to potential 
disturbances. 
Four highly sensitive sites were identified: Hannah Point (SH), 
Penguin Island (SH), the Aitcho Islands (SH), and Turret Point (SH). 
Nine moderately sensitive sites were identified: Brown Bluff (NE), Fort 
Point (SH), Gourdin Island (NW), Orne Island (NW), Paulet Island (NE), 
Petermann Island (SW), Pléneau Island (SW), Georges Point, Rongé Island 
(NW), and Waterboat Point (NW). 
In summary, of 76 Peninsula sites visited by the Inventory since 
1994, 
23 
(or 
30%) 
exhibit 
high/medium 
species 
diversity 
or 
high/moderate

potential 
environmental 
disturbance 
(Naveen, et al., 2001; Naveen, unpublished field data, 1999-2002). A 
list of these 23 sites follows, indicating whether each site exhibits 
high or medium species diversity, high or moderate sensitivity to 
 
9
potential environmental disturbance from visitors, or ranks among the
