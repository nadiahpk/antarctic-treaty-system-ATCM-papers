1.1 
Notification of the measures taken pursuant to Article 13, paragraph

The Republic of South Africa has taken the following measures to ensure 
compliance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty: 
 
• 
Adoption of the Antarctic Treaties Act (Act No. 60 of 1996) on 1 
November 1996 (Government Gazette, Vol. 376, No. 17536).

Adoption of the Antarctic Treaties Act, 1996 (Act No. 60 of 1996), 
Amendment of Schedule 1 of the Act on 16 May 1997 (Government 
Gazette, Vol. 383, No. 17993, Regulation Gazette No. 5926). 
 
The Antarctic Treaties Act came into force on 1 November 1996, and 
presently regulations for further implementation of the Act are being 
developed. 
 
Operations at the SANAE IV base, Earth Sciences camps, transport 
routes, Emergency Base, Bukta and on supply ships are governed by an 
Environmental Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS) shaped 
by the requirements  contained in the Environmental Protocol. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 
Contingency plans established in accordance with Article 15 of the

South Africa established an Oil Spill Contingency Plan for the South

the guidelines as set out by the Council of Managers of National Antarctic

ARTICLE

OF 
THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL 
 
2.1 
Procedures to consider the environmental impacts of proposed 
activities in Antarctica (Annex I, Article 6 (1a)) 
 
The procedures laid down in Annex I of the Protocol are adhered to by 
South Africa, and a detailed description of the process to be followed will 
be incorporated in the Regulations that are being developed. 
 
2.2 
List of Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEE) developed in 
accordance with Article 2 and decisions taken (Annex I, Article 6 
(1b)) 
 
During the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 1999, South Africa compiled an 
IEE for the decommissioning of the Sarie Marais base at Grunehogna. 
Due to time, weather and ships space limitations however, the action was 
only partially completed (two of nine containerised structures removed) 
and was re-scheduled for completion in the 2001/2002 summer and 
2002/2003 season, if required. Fortunately, we were able to complete the 
full decommissioning during this past Antarctic summer. Copies of the IEE 
are available from this Department on request.

Antarctic activities are monitored by South Africa in accordance with an

in continuation of the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) 
compiled for the SANAE IV base, including ship and helicopter operations 
and over-snow transport.

Report on implementation of Waste Management Plan (Annex III, 
Article 9 (1) of the Protocol) 
 
Since 1991/92, South Africa’s Waste Management Plan has been fully 
implemented and all the waste generated during expeditions are 
separated and categorised according to the Plan and retrograded out of 
Antarctica.  
 
All household waste is sorted into categories of glass, metal, kitchen food 
waste, chemicals, oils and medical waste and are sealed in drums. All 
paper and plastics are compacted into bales and stored in steel orange 
containers. Building waste from the construction phase was loaded into 
plywood and timber crates. The following was back-loaded and returned to 
South Africa following the 2001/2002 summer season:
