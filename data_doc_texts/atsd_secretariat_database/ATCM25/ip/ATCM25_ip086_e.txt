Deep ice core drilling project II at Dome Fuji, Antarctica

National Institute of polar Research, Tokyo, Japan

Deep ice core drilling to the bottom of the ice sheet will be carried out in three consecutive summer seasons starts from 2003/2004 at Dome Fuji, located at the top of ice sheet on Dronning Maud Land. The purpose of the present project is to carry out ice core drilling to the bottom, 3030 m below the surface, at Dome Fuji, and to perform detailed study on climate and environmental changes in global scale for a period of more than 800,000 years in the past including the emergence of glacial cycles in Quaternary period.  Prior to this project, the deep ice core drilling was executed at Dome Fuji in 1995 and1996, and cores of good quality to the depth of 2503 m could be collected.  This has made it possible to study and identify climate and environment changes for a period of 320,000 years including three glacial cycles.

Annual plan
It is planned to build a new coring site at Dome Fuji in the summer of 2002/03. In 2003, eight members of the 44th JARE will stay throughout the year at Dome Fuji and install core drilling and in-situ analytical equipments. The 45th JARE will start deep ice core drilling 2003/2004 and the drilling will be continued to the season of 2005/06. Seven members to be in charge of drilling and in-situ core analysis will be transported from Novolazarevskaya to Dome Fuji by air flight.  At the end of winters in 2004 and 2005, an over-snow traverse party will transport fuel and other cargo from Syowa to Dome Fuji and prepare runway for air flight.
