IAATO-Wide-Emergency Contingency and 
Search and Rescue Plan
           A Brief Summary of the Work in Progress


It was agreed during the IAATO 2001 General Meeting to begin working on an IAATO-wide contingency plan.  Progress was made on the plan during the 2001-2002 season and will continue into the 2002-2003 season.


1. The cornerstones for an IAATO-wide emergency contingency and search and rescue plans for Antarctic cruise vessels are the following:
    • Assure that there is adequate emergency equipment available onboard IAATO ships
    • Assure that the ships’ schedules and positions are frequently updated
    • Assure effective communication via GMDSS or INM-C including reporting schema for a possible event
    • Medical evacuation support


2. Emergency situations to consider are:
    • Ice damages on hull, propeller and rudder
    • Heavy weather and sea damages
    • Medical emergencies
    • Man overboard from the ship, Zodiacs, kayaks, etc.
    • Grounding and stranding
    • General oil spill from deck equipment, Zodiacs, boats, helicopters, etc.
    • Waste oil spill
    • Mechanical failure and steering failure
    • Power outage, blackout 
    • Fire
    • Collision
    • Security threat
    • Explosion


3. The proper action plans to deal with the above emergencies are as follows:
    • Damage control plan
    • Medical contingency plan
    • Search and Rescue plan
    • Fire plan
    • Oil spill and pollution plan, SOPEP
    • Mechanical and steering failure plan
    • Security and threat plan
    • Evacuation and abandon ship plan
    • Plan for evacuation of passengers and crew from large cruise vessels and all others

All ships have plans in place otherwise they would not be issued certificates.  Vessels are required to operate under the ISM-code and consequently they have a well-established Safety Management System in place. However, these plans can vary because there is not an international standardized format. In trying to establish an IAATO-wide Emergency Response Plan we have to be aware of and accept the differences and try to simplify the co-ordinations of our common Emergency Plans.


4. Currently in place are the following: 
    • A well-established spreadsheet of vessel itineraries in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic
    • Improved communication via GMDSS or INM-C radio system. 
    • Established medical evacuation plan 
    • Database detailing emergency equipment available on board all IAATO ships. 
    • All ships are in compliance with ISM, MARPOL, SOLAS, etc.
    • Agreement to assist each vessel in any emergency


5. Suggested Preventive Measures: 

    • Encourage the use of very light Marine Gas Oil (MGO) fuel during the Antarctic season. Light MGO is a non-persistent fuel oil that evaporates from the ocean surface in less then 3 days after a spill, even in polar waters. MGO however is more expensive
    • Lubricating oil is very persistent and will always be a problem. Lubricating oil must be kept onboard in several tanks and in low quantities, which will minimize the environmental impact from an incident
    • Use of appropriate ships for appropriate ice conditions

6. Future Work
    • Appendix A is a spreadsheet that was distributed to IAATO members during the 2001-2002 season in order to gather information about the emergency equipment for our mutual knowledge. This will need to be updated as necessary. 
    • Regular update of data base
    • Address potential of a significant oil spill and pollution incident
    • Most importantly, focus efforts on preventive measures. 
    • Prepare IAATO-wide Contingency and Search and Rescue Plans

Flow Chart

The command center for any emergencies in Antarctica will always be the ship, which is the victim of an emergency. The Master of the distressed ship should be the commander for all the emergency response activities. If desired by the Master from the ship in an emergency, another ship and its Master can be appointed as the commander and the command center. However, that Master can only act on behalf of the distressed ship and will not have any legal obligations than what is accepted under normal international shipping practice.			

Any salvage and rescue operation should be in line with the Lloyd’s standard form of the Salvage Agreement, NO CURE - NO PAY. Such an agreement will immediately be established as soon as the ships involved verbally refer to the above document. IAATO ships directly involved in the emergency operation should share any salvage payment. The proportions of any salvage payment will be fixed by Arbitration in London. It will not be necessary for any ships to negotiate on site.

RESPONSIBILITY
TASK
TIME
INITIAL





1
Master
Activate appropriate communication- and checklists from the




individual company Safety Management System including SOPEP




if an oil spill is expected. All ships operating in Antarctica should




have an updated  SOPEP with an Antarctic appendix for proper




action.







2
Master
Contact all the other IAATO ships via the GMDSS. Use the




established radio log for proper contacts and documentation.







3
Master
Contact IAATO







4
Master
Contact the nearest Antarctic stations







5
Master
Contact national government




The governments to whom the tour operator has given the




advanced notification and/or environmental impact assessment




regarding Antarctic visit.







6
Master
Contact COMNAP







7
Master
Establish a list of ships that have arrived on site and agreed to




Lloyds salvage agreement, NO CURE - NO PAY.







8
Master
Keep notes about when the contacts are established with specific 




parties involved in the emergency procedures.
