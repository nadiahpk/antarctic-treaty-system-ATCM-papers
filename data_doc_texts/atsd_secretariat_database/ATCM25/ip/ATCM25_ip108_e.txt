Management of Antarctic Non-Government Activities – Australian Comments


Overview

This paper provides Australian comments on the management challenges associated with tourist and other non-government activities (NGAs) in Antarctica.  Such activities are diverse, ranging from large operators using cruise ships to individual adventures on private yachts.  Similarly, the administrative circumstances vary between Parties and many management measures require international cooperation to be pursued.

Tourism often focuses on wildlife concentrations and historic sites.  There is also pressure to seek remote and less visited sites, and expansion beyond the current focus on the Antarctic Peninsula can be expected.  IAATO figures indicate that tourism numbers are set to grow and that the range of activities is likely to diversify.  The Antarctic environment is harsh and unpredictable and non-government expeditions need to be well planned by experienced operators.  Environmental protection, safety and disruption to national science programs are major issues.
	
The last substantial consideration of Antarctic tourism management was at ATCM XVIII, which adopted Recommendation 1 and its appended Guidance to Visitors to the Antarctic and Guidance to Those Organising and Conducting Tourism or Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic.  Together with the requirements of the Madrid Protocol, these are currently used by Antarctic Treaty Parties and IAATO as the basis for managing Antarctic NGAs.

ATCM XXIV agreed that Antarctic tourism should be the subject of detailed discussion at ATCM XXV.  Specific matters to address include:

    • cumulative environmental impacts of tourist activities;
    • potential introduction of exotic pests and diseases;
    • possible disruption and costs to national science programs;
    • the growth in the number of large cruise vessels visiting the Antarctic;
    • safety and self-sufficiency, particularly of small private expeditions;
    • the increased risk of fuel spills and other pollution;
    • the increased potential for tourist air travel to the continent;
    • potential expansion of permanent tourist infrastructure; and
    • jurisdictional issues.

Some of these issues are discussed in this paper, with possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Parties, and relevant non-contracting Parties, identified.

Australia’s expectations of Antarctic tourism

Australia recognises that tourism is a legitimate use of the Antarctic, provided it is undertaken in a manner that protects environmental and research values and does not impact on other uses.

In line with ATCM XVIII Recommendation 1 and the Madrid Protocol, Australia seeks to ensure that Antarctic NGAs:

    • cause minimal impacts on the environment;
    • are safe, self-sufficient, informed and responsible;
    • are compatible with other legitimate uses of the region;
    • are conducted in accordance with all domestic legislation and international requirements;
    • are planned so that all necessary information can be provided to relevant agencies and other Treaty Parties in a free and timely manner; and
    • where feasible, provide benefit to other legitimate operators.

Australia’s involvement in Antarctic tourism

Australia’s interest in Antarctic tourism is at many levels.  Australians organise tourist cruises in the Antarctic Peninsula, the Ross Sea region and Eastern Antarctica and undertake small adventure expeditions.  Sightseeing flights operate each summer from southern Australian airports.  Hobart is a major gateway port to Antarctica.  

The Australian Government has administrative responsibilities relating to the management of Antarctic tourism, particularly in relation to ensuring compliance with the Madrid Protocol and other Treaty requirements.  This includes assessing environmental evaluations in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol.  The Tasmanian State Government administers tourist visits to sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island.

The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) provides educational materials for prospective visitors to Antarctica and guidance to operators planning tourist visits.  The AAD currently publishes information on NGAs through the publicly accessible Antarctic Non-government Activity News (ANAN).

From time to time the AAD uses tour vessels to supplement its own shipping capacity to transport expedition staff.

Self-regulation of Antarctic tourism 

Australia acknowledges the role played by IAATO in regulating activities by its members.  IAATO’s membership includes most Antarctic tour companies, but few charter yacht operators and no individuals undertaking adventure expeditions.  IAATO has promulgated the guidelines set out in ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1, as well as its own by-laws and has developed activity and site-specific guidelines.

In its report to ATCM XXIV, IAATO recognised that uncontrolled growth in tourism may have adverse cumulative effects on the environment.  Pressure may come from an increase in the number of large cruise vessels visiting Antarctica.  At its 2001 meeting, IAATO changed its by-laws to permit operators with vessels carrying more than 500 passengers to become members, provided that no passenger landings are made in Antarctica.

Additional pressures could come from small operators who are not members of IAATO and who may not have the expertise to ensure their impacts are properly managed, such as the potential to introduce exotic pests through ineffective quarantine measures.

IAATO has recognised the need for better mechanisms to regulate Antarctic tourism and has sought improved methods for compliance with its by-laws.  However, IAATO has no mechanism to manage the activities of non-IAATO members.  


Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· monitor industry growth by improving collection of data on tourist activities
· develop measures to limit large cruise vessels to sites capable of carrying the impact
· complement industry regulation with measures that better address independent expeditions
· review effectiveness of Recommendation XVIII-1 in its application by industry

Management of environmental impacts

The Madrid Protocol provides for the management of environmental impacts in the Treaty area for all activities, including tourist and other NGAs.  However, there are some issues to be resolved in its application to these activities.  These include cumulative environmental impacts, and the potential impacts on areas not previously visited by tourists (or national programs) and for which there may be little environmental information.  There is also scope for improved coordination between Parties when considering EIAs for NGAs.

Short of a major incident such as a fuel spill, it is unlikely that a single visit to a site will have a significant effect on the environment if the visit is undertaken in accordance with the Protocol.  However, in the absence of effective monitoring, the cumulative effects of multiple visits to a site are generally unknown.

With the exception of Macquarie Island, tourist interest in the vicinity of Australia’s Antarctic stations is very low and there is unlikely to be any immediate threat of cumulative impacts.  However, Australian companies are active in the Antarctic Peninsula area and therefore Australia has an interest in the monitoring of impacts in this area.  There is an emerging need for coordinated assessment of cumulative impacts at frequently visited sites.  The workshop on the cumulative environmental impacts of ship-based tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula area in June 2000 provided a starting point for discussions on this.  

The increase in Antarctic tourist numbers and the range of activities has the potential to extend the number of sites likely to be visited.  Operators are under pressure to find less-visited sites to give their clients a better experience.  However, such visits pose environmental problems.  A major concern is the potential to introduce diseases or exotic pests to these areas.  There is also potential for inexperienced people to damage sensitive or scientifically important sites.  The Parties may wish to consider restricting tourist access to such areas, or require that operators proposing to visit such sites have personnel with suitable experience to enable them to assess the potential impacts of their activities.  These operators should also have a responsibility to provide information to Parties and the tourist industry about the environmental characteristics of those sites so that better informed management decisions can be made in future.



Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

    • identify frequently visited tourist sites and monitor cumulative impacts
    • identify and monitor less frequently visited sites susceptible to cumulative impacts
    • develop policies to manage visits to the more environmentally sensitive areas
    • improve coordination of assessment of EIAs for NGAs
    • develop further site-specific or activity-specific guidelines and educational material
    • examine the feasibility of establishing qualification standards and/or training for key expedition personnel
    • promote the use of official or qualified observers on cruises to specific sites
    • promote environmental reporting by tour operators

Ongoing oversight of tourism

Partial oversight of tourist activities is provided by the industry, and some by governmental involvement.  Prior to granting full membership, IAATO places an observer on board an operator’s vessel to assess compliance with environmental and safety guidelines.  The observer’s report on the operator’s compliance is referred to the next IAATO meeting for consideration.  IAATO may also place an observer on a member’s vessel where there has been some concern about compliance with environmental and safety provisions.  It is self-evident that oversight by IAATO covers only its members.

Some Parties provide guides at their stations or historic sites to help manage tourist activities, and some place observers aboard tour vessels.  The AAD has provided an observer on some Australian organised tour vessels, particularly where it is a new operator or a new kind of activity.  The AAD places observers on tourist over-flights from Australia.

The benefit of national observers is increasingly recognised.  Observers can report on the practices of new operators or the activities of established operators undertaking novel activities, or to audit established activities for compliance with the EIA and other requirements.  In addition, observers can supervise visits to sensitive environmental or historic sites, although such roles require observers to be suitably qualified.  Observers also have a role in educating visitors and the operator on their various obligations and on Antarctic matters more generally.

Although Article VII of the Treaty and Article 14 of the Madrid Protocol provide for the appointment of inspectors, there have been very few inspections of tourist vessels and, as far as Australia is aware, no inspections of private air services.

Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· support IAATO’s application of an accreditation scheme for its members
· develop measures to cover non-IAATO operators
· develop an agreed methodology for placement of observers that, over time, covers the entire industry
· encourage more Treaty inspections of non-government activities, including small adventure expeditions
· circulate reports of observations and inspections

Safety, self-sufficiency and insurance

Safety and self-sufficiency of Antarctic tourism and other NGAs are critical given the lack of infrastructure for medical, environmental or SAR emergencies and the risks and costs to national programs should their resources be called on in an emergency.  Tourist vessels should be constructed and staffed to present minimum risk to the environment and to operate safely in Antarctic conditions.  Although Annex IV of Article of the Madrid Protocol deals with the construction and manning of ships, there appears to be limited capacity to stop unsuitable vessels operating in Antarctic waters.  

The difficulty in ensuring the safety of Antarctic tour vessels could be addressed by the development of a specific code for Antarctic cruise vessels.  Some control over Antarctic tour vessels could also be achieved through the terms of insurance cover taken out by the owners of those vessels, it being unlikely that an insurer would provide cover for a vessel that did not meet safety requirements.

National programs should not be expected to cover the cost of rescuing non-government expeditions.  Apart from the cost, there is also potential for significant disruption to national scientific programs.  Many Parties urge non-government expeditions to carry adequate insurance to cover any costs that may result from unplanned or accidental incidents.  Recent increases in the cost of public liability insurance may make it prohibitive for small NG expeditions to obtain insurance.  It would be of benefit for all Parties to adopt a common approach to insurance requirements.

Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· consider the feasibility of requiring adequate insurance by tour operators and private adventure expeditions
· deny station visits to operators inadequately prepared or insured
· request the IMO to apply its Guidelines for Ships Operating in Arctic Ice-covered Waters to vessels operating in the Antarctic, with those modifications proposed by COMNAP
· develop guidelines on private aircraft operations

Potential impacts of large cruise vessels and tourist aircraft activities 

While IAATO limits the activities of its members’ use of large vessels, such vessels operated by non-members are not so restrained.  There is an additional concern that large vessels produce more waste and, not generally being highly ice-strengthened, present increased potential for fuel-spill incidents.  
	
The increasing diversity of the range of tourist activities will see a greater use of aircraft taking visitors to more remote parts of Antarctica.  Adventure Network International has been the major provider of tourist air transport and ground support for trekking, climbing and similar activities.  However, several other operators have expressed an interest in developing this type of service in Antarctica, possibly incorporating more substantial accommodation for visitors.  While aircraft transport per se does not necessarily pose greater environmental impacts, the potential for permanent infrastructure, search and rescue, and access to remote areas will all need to be considered by the Treaty Parties with a view to developing appropriate management strategies.

Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· develop measures to address the specific safety and environmental risks posed by large vessels
· develop measures to manage the potential proliferation of remote field camps
· examine SAR implications of tourist use of aircraft

Relationship between government and non-government activities

The distinction between government and non-government expeditions in Antarctica is not always clear.  Non-government activities sometimes ‘piggyback’ on existing government operations and government programs sometimes purchase berths on tourist vessels to deploy their personnel.  This latter practice can be a cost effective mechanism for transporting personnel to areas that are not normally visited by national program vessels or at more convenient times.  Such use of tourist transport should accord with relevant requirements under the Treaty and the Madrid Protocol. 

The use of air transport between Australia and Casey in being investigated to support Australia’s program.  Use of these facilities for tourism is not being considered by Australia, although a number of other national program air facilities have been used by non-government operators.  

Possible response by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· consider the need for consistency of practice in the use of government facilities by tourists, and in the use of tourist infrastructure by national programs.

Jurisdictional issues

The legal obligations of tour operators and NG expeditions depend, to a large degree, on whether they are nationals of a Party to the Antarctic Treaty and whether that Party has ratified the Madrid Protocol.  

Currently, there is one Treaty Party (Canada) that has not ratified the Protocol and which has nationals that regularly undertake Antarctic tourist activities.  There is also potential for nationals from non-Parties to organise activities.  Expeditions generally depart from one of the five major Antarctic gateways (Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa) although some voyages and flights could in future depart directly from non-Party ports in Africa and Asia.

The management of Antarctic tourism would be greatly facilitated if all countries that have nationals organising such activities were parties to the Treaty and had ratified the Madrid Protocol.  However, this cannot be achieved at short notice.  If the activity is to be organised by a recognised tour company, then a partial solution may be to encourage that company to become a member of IAATO which has by-laws that reflect Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol requirements.

Another potential method of managing non-Party activities would be for the gateway states to encourage operators using their ports to comply with relevant requirements of the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol.

For States that are party to the Madrid Protocol, general EIA requirements are set out in Annex I, but apart from the preparation of the Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations it does not provide specific guidelines for the preparation of lower level assessments.  Consideration could be given to the development of EIA guidelines for use by tour operators, along the lines of the work being undertaken by AEON.  There is no agreed approach to other approval processes, such as for safety and self-sufficiency requirements or insurance standards.

There are also potential problems in managing NGAs involving nationals from a number of different countries.  For example, an operator from one country may charter shipping from another Party, depart from a third Party, visit the stations of several other Parties, and carry passengers from a range of other States.  This could result in a requirement for the preparation of multiple EIAs or, worse, a situation where no Party assumes responsibility.  There is also a risk of “forum shopping” where the proponent seeks out the Party with the least onerous approval processes.  Apart from the environmental issues, there is also potential for some aspects of the safety and self-sufficiency issues to be overlooked in a multi-jurisdictional context, or for inconsistent requirements to be imposed.  Treaty Parties will therefore need to ensure effective coordination of the management and assessment of such activities.



Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· encourage accession to the Treaty and ratification of the Protocol by any State whose nationals organise Antarctic tourist activities
·encourage membership of IAATO
· develop consistent EIA and other approvals processes for Antarctic NG operators to minimise “forum shopping” by operators 
· where multiple NG operators and/or State affiliations are involved in planning activities, develop guidelines for determining which proponent organisation and State have primary responsibility for preparing EIAs and endorsing them

Harmonisation of the management of tourism 

With the tendency for Antarctic tourism to be concentrated in popular areas, and the potential for those activities to have a cumulative impact at those sites, there would be benefits in developing a mechanism for coordinating information about these activities.  The EIA process can assist in capturing information but currently does not provide consistent information or capture operators outside the system.

IAATO has developed guidelines for a range of tourist activities as an enhancement of the guidelines appended to Recommendation XVIII-1.  However, there are no common guidelines for other regular activities (such as small-boat cruising, skiing, diving and camping) to assist in minimising threats to the Antarctic environment and in promoting the safety of tourists.  In addition, there are no guidelines for the conduct of tourist over-flights as the re-introduction of such activities was not contemplated at the time of adoption of Recommendation XVIII-1.

Australia will continue to support, in conjunction with IAATO and other industry experts, the development of operational guidelines and educational material for typical non-government activities.

Although IAATO collects information on member activities (and on some other operators), there is no formal mechanism within the ATS to ensure timely exchange of detailed information about Antarctic NGAs, other than the limited annual Treaty information exchange.  Australia disseminates information about tourist activities in the fortnightly Antarctic Non-government Activity News (ANAN) to email subscribers and via the internet.  Although this publication assists information exchange and coordination of tourist activities, there also would be value in developing a centralised data collection system to capture such information in a more uniform and timely manner.  

Possible responses by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties:

· develop guidelines on best practice for the conduct of Antarctic tourism and specialised adventure activities
· develop guidelines for tourist over-flights
· develop consistent educational information for visitors
· develop a data management system for timely sharing of information about Antarctic tourist activities



Conclusion

Most Antarctic non-government activities are regulated by the Treaty Parties using a range of mechanisms, but there are emerging gaps.  There is substantial reliance on self-regulation, industry standards, and a high degree of motivation by operators to cooperate with the Treaty system.  The future of Antarctic tourism and other NGAs is, however, likely to see increased pressures on the Antarctic environment as numbers continue to grow, further incidents involving safety, and increasing challenge to the established management mechanisms.

Self-regulation by the tourism industry, though IAATO, has to date been largely effective in achieving compliance with the Madrid Protocol by its members.  However, there have been safety incidents involving non-IAATO members.  The provisions of Recommendation XVIII-1 will be increasingly inadequate for managing such activities.

With the predicted growth in Antarctic tourism, the possibility of new operators using large vessels and the proliferation of adventure expeditions, effective management of non-government activity in the future will require more concerted monitoring and coordination mechanisms and management approaches that are consistent in their application.  

Future mechanisms need to encompass better information exchange on NGAs; better monitoring of tourist and adventure activities; strategies for managing non-Party activities; more effective jurisdictional arrangements to ensure compliance with Madrid Protocol and other requirements; measures to minimise unacceptable cumulative impacts; and more coordinated arrangements for ensuring safety and self-sufficiency.
