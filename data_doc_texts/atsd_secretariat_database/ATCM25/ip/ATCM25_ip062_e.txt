Draft Response Plan in the Event that Unusual Animal Deaths are 
Discovered 
 
In early December 2001 Australia advised Antarctic Treaty Parties by email of an 
unusual mortality of Adelie penguins at Welch Island near Australia’s Mawson 
Station in MacRobertson Land.  Suspecting that this mortality might have been 
caused by an outbreak of an infectious disease the Australian Antarctic Division 
quickly put in place some processes designed to reduce the chance that the disease 
organisms might accidentally be spread by scientists and other people.  A full autopsy 
of Adelie penguin carcasses carried out later in Australia revealed that the mortality 
was not caused by a disease but by the effects of a severe storm that resulted in wide-
scale breaking of ice in Welch Bay.  Penguins were killed by being physically crushed 
by violent ice movements, and not by infectious disease. 
 
The event revealed that Australia was ill-prepared for a possible outbreak of 
infectious disease.  It had no documented plan of action prepared nor processes and 
procedures for managing an outbreak.  This matter has subsequently been addressed 
and a draft response plan developed.  The plan will be widely promulgated in 
Australia’s three continental stations.  The full draft response plan can be found at the 
Australian Antarctic Division’s website (www.aad.gov.au), go to the “Environment” 
page and follow the links to “our responsibilities” and “protecting wildlife”. 
 
Development of this draft plan is consistent with Article 15 (Emergency Response 
Action) of the Environmental Annex to the Antarctic Treaty.  Its objectives are to 
reduce the likelihood of accidental spread by people of the infectious agent if disease 
is involved and to obtain information on the species involved, the number and spatial 
extent of affected animals and the cause. 
 
 
Summary of the Draft Response Plan 
 
The response plan is designed to provide guidance for people working in Antarctica 
on what to do if sick or dead animals are discovered in unusually high numbers or 
with signs that suggest disease.  It further seeks to reduce the likelihood of people 
unwittingly spreading the infective agent if a disease is involved.  The plan targets 
station staff – scientists and support staff – and assists Headquarters staff manage the 
incident. 
 
The draft response plan covers the following matters: 
 
1 
The discovery of an unusually high numbers of sick or dead animals should 
immediately be reported to the Station Leader.   Access to the site should be restricted 
to reduce the risk of accidental transference of pathogens to uninfected populations. 
Other colonies or sites with aggregations of animals should not be visited without 
precautions being taken to prevent transfer of pathogens on boots, clothes, vehicles or 
equipment. 
 
2 
The decision on what constitutes unusual numbers of sick or dead animals can 
be made only on the basis of experience of what is normal for the species and 
location. If dead or dying animals are discovered in numbers, or in a condition which 
is considered unusual, this should trigger the use of the plan.   
 
3 
If animals are observed exhibiting behaviours such as staggering, falling, lying 
prone or showing signs of distress, together with the presence of dead animals, this 
should be interpreted as prima facie evidence that a disease may be present. 
 
4 
Sufficient data should be collected initially to provide animal experts with 
information to determine whether something unusual has been discovered.  
Photographs of the animals are very valuable and, if taken on a digital camera, can be 
sent quickly to Headquarters for analysis and advice.  The finder should record: 
 
• location including coordinates, using a GPS if available 
• area affected 
• species involved 
• indication of the number of animals involved - if possible count the dead and 
dying and estimate the percentage of each among the colony 
• symptoms 
• contact details of all people who were at the site 
• weather conditions now and, if known, over the previous week (necessary 
because birds will pant in the “heat” and look sick but are healthy). 
 
5 
Boots should be cleaned using sea water or snow before leaving the general 
area of the dead or dying animals. Repeated washing in sea water will remove most 
pathogens. 
 
6 
A central element in Australia’s response plan is the provision of a response 
kit at each station.  This is a box that contains a copy of the response plan together 
with the following materials: 
 
Personnel Protective Equipment 
• disposable overalls 
• disposable overshoes 
• disposable gloves  
• disposable surgical masks  
• disinfectant hand wipes 
• chlorine bleach  (sodium hypochlorite) 
and “Virkon” disinfectants 
 
Data Recording Equipment 
• notebooks - field and laboratory 
• pencils 
• pens  
• marker pens  
• counters  (for population counting) 
• stock spray  (for marking birds / carcasses to 
assist with accurate counting) 
• rack for blood tubes 
• rack for cryotubes tubes 
SAMPLING EQUIPMENT 
 
Blood Collection and Serum Storage 
• syringes 
• needles (3 sizes) 
• blood collection tubes 
• sterile transfer pipettes (for transfer of 
serum) 
• cryotubes (for storage of serum)  
• needle disposal container 
Collection and Storage of Bacterial and Viral 
Swabs 
• sterile swabs 
• cryotubes (for storage of swabs in transport 
media) 
• sterile plastic transfer pipettes (for transfer of 
media to cryotubes) 
• Brain Heart Infusion Broth powder (for Bacterial 
and Viral Transport Media)) 
• sterile water (to make media) 
 
• penicillin (for Viral Transport Media) 
• streptomycin (for Viral Transport Media) 
• autoclave 
bottles 
(for 
media 
storage 
and 
sterilisation) 
• rack for cryotubes 
Preservation of Ectoparasites and 
Blood Smears for Haemoparasite 
Identification 
• cryotubes 
• 70% ethanol and glycerol ( for 
preservation of ectoparasites) 
• glass slides 
• anti-coagulant blood collection tubes 
• 100% methanol 
• transfer pipettes 
• slide boxes 
• Coplin jar (used fixing blood smears) 
Collection and Preservation of Carcasses 
• plastic bags 
• tags and string 
 
 
Post-Mortem Equipment 
• forceps,  plain and rat-toothed 
• bone cutters  
• surgical scissors  
• disposable 
scalpels 
with 
plastic 
handles 
• sharps disposal container 
• ruler 
• tape measure 
• swabs 
• large and small jars  
• cryotubes  
• Whirlpak bags  
• 10% buffered formo-saline  
 
 
The box should be kept in a prominent location in the station, such as in the medical 
facility.

Standing permits for the collection of specimens in the Antarctic have been 
issued (subject to their activation by permitting authorities) for use in response to the 
discovery of unusual numbers of dead animals.  The response plan makes clear the 
range of permits required, which helps the field party and Headquarters staff to 
expedite all formalities as quickly as possible. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The experience of November 2001 at Welch Island indicated that the Australian 
program lacked an agreed plan to assist with the management of a suspected disease 
outbreak.  The draft response plan now provides a course of action, and necessary 
materials, for dealing with an outbreak (or suspected outbreak) in a planned and co-
ordinated manner.
