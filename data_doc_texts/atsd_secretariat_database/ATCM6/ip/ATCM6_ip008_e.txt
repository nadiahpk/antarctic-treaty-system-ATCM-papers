the Chair Speech by Mr. A. Matsui,
the Chairman of the 6th Consultative Meeting

Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I should like to express my sincere gratitude to
those who proposed and seconded the motion that I be
appointed Chairman of this 6th Antarctic Treaty Consul-
tative Meeting, as well as to all the other participants
present here, for the honour which they have bestowed on
me.

I realize that I have been appointed Chairman of
this Meeting largely because I am the leader of the
Japanese Delegation and because you are meeting in my
country. Though my acquaintance with Antarctic problems
began only 2 years ago in Paris when I was the Japanese
Ambassador there, I was then impressed by the cooperative
and friendly atmosphere which permeated the 5th Consultative
Meeting held in Paris in November 1968. I hope that this
spirit will also prevail at this meeting.

I will certainly spare no efforts in my capacity as
Chairman in attempting to reach a successful conclusion
of
- 2 -

of this Consultative Meeting. And it is my sincere hope
that all the Delegations will be good enough to give me
useful help and guidance.
Thank you very much.
