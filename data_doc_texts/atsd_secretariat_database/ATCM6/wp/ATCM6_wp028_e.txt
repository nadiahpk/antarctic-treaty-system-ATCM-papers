DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives,

Recognizing the special scientific interest of volcanic phenomena
in the Antarctic;

Recalling that the investigation of the colonization of an
uncontaminated area by animals and plants can easily be spoiled by
the presence of man;

Recommend to their Governments that any new island created by
volcanic activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area should be the subject
of immediate consultation through diplomatic cnannels with a view to
its consideration at the next Consultative Meeting for designation
as a Specially Protected Area and that, until this can be done, they
should use their best endeavours to preserve it.
