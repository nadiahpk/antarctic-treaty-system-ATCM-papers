Draft Recommendation submitted by Chile

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA:
ISLAND DECEPCION

Considering that the island of Decepción, including
its neighbouring sea, has been affected by a succession
of parasitical eruptions of a disastrous nature which
have caused morphological changes and as a result of it
altered the ecological structure of the island, resulting
in the temporary disappearance of all signs of life in
some parts of the land and sea,

and that, it is important to protect the whole
area from any action by man which could alter the
ecological development of the land and sea which has
already started and which will happen naturally,

and that, the above-noted phenomena take on a
character of outstanding scientific attraction, both
from the geophysical point of view, because of the
geophysical phenomena which have been produced, and
from the biological point of view, because of the begin-
ning of the re-establishment of life in the different
environments which have been formed, everything should
be carefully examined in case other activities should
interfere with the pure scientific;

the Representatives recommend that their Governments
designate the island of Decepción (Lat. 62°59'44"S. &
Long. 60°33'57"W.) as a specially protected area up to
2 miles from the base-line shown in the attached
sketch-map.
ISLAND ROBERT (COPPER MINE PENINSULAR)

Considering that the Copper Mine Peninsular, Robert Island, is a biologically diverse area, both 
in terms of numbers of species of birds which live and nest there and in terms of the wide area which well 
illustrates isothermaL tundra with interesting 
"biocenosis brioxenas" which it is vital to study in 
detail without changing the underground structure; the 
Representatives recommend that their Governments 
include in the Annex B. Specially Protected Areas, of 
the Conventional Measurements, the following,

    SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA
    COPPER MINE PENINSULAR, ROBERT ISLAND
    Lat. 61°23'S.         Long. 59°41'W.

DESCRIPTION: The area covers all the land and sea 
which are shown in the attached map, contained between 
Cape Morris and the eastern side of Cape Triplet.
