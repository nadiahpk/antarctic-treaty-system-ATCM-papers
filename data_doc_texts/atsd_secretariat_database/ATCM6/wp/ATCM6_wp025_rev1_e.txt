DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

SUBMITTED BY A WORKING GROUP

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENT
EXPEDITIONS TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Noting the increase in the number of tourists and visitors who are
not sponsored by the Consultative Governments to the Antarctic Treaty
area in recent years;

Considering that the activities of such people can have lasting and
harmful effects on scientific programmes and the Antarctic environment,
particularly in Specially Protected Areas and on historic monuments;

Desiring to ensure that visitors are offered the best view of Antarctic
stations compatible with the research programmes being undertaken;

Recalling Articles VII(5) and X of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommenda-
tions I-VI and IV-27;
- 2 -

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They should exert appropriate efforts to ensure that all tourists
and other visitors do not engage in any activity in the Treaty Area
which is contrary to the principles and purposes of the Antarctic
Treaty or Recommendations made under it;

2. They should inform, in so far as they are able, those responsible
for expeditions to the Treaty Area not organized by a Consultative
Party but organized in, proceeding from, or calling at, their territory
of the following:

    (i) that notice of confirmation to visit any station be given
to that station at least twenty four hours in advance of
the expected time of arrival;

    (ii) that all tourists and other visitors comply with any
conditions or restrictions on their movements which the
station commander may stipulate for their safety or to
safeguard scientific programmes being undertaken at or
near the station;

    (iii) that the visitors must not enter Specially Protected Areas
and must respect designated historic monuments;

3. Advance notice of all expeditions to the Treaty Area not organized
by that Party, but organized in proceeding from or calling at, that
Party's territory, shall be given in so far as is possible, to the
other Consultative Parties and shall include the relevant information
listed in Recommendation I-VI.

4. Until such, time as this Recommendation becomes effective in 
accordance with Article IX, of the Antarctic Treaty, this Recommenda-
tion, as far as feasible, be considered as guidelines in the interim 
period.
