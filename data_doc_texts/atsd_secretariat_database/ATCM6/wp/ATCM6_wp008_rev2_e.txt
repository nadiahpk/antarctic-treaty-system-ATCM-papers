The Representatives,

Considering that:

In recent years a number of countries have launched scientific
research rockets (sounding rockets) from the Antarctic Treaty area and
that the number of such launchings in expected to increase along with
the scale and importance of scientific research activitites in Antarctica;

It will be necessary to adopt adequate safety measures to prevent
possible damage or injury to persons, fauna and flora, facilities,
vessels and aircraft in the Antarctic Treaty area and in adjacent areas
which might otherwise result from the launching of rockets from the
Treaty area.

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. Each Government which plans to launch rockets from the
Antarctic Treaty area include in its annual exchange of information
under Article VII paragraph 5 details of its planned launchings,
including inter alia, the following information.
- 2 -

(i) the place of launching

(ii) the time and date of launching or, alternatively, the 
approximate period of time during which it is planned 
to carry out the launchings

(iii) the direction of launching

(iv) the planned maximum altitude

(v) the planned impact area

(vi) the type and other specifications of the rockets to 
be launched, including possible residual harzard

(vii) the purpose and research programme of the rocket;

2. During summer operations each station use  its radio facilities 
to keep neighbouring stations informed, on a daily basis as appropriate,
of it's launching schedules.
