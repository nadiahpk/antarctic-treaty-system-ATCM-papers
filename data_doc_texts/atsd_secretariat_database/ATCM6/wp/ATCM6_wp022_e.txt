Draft Recommendation
(Submited by the United Kingdom)

Co-ordination of Antarctic scientific investigations
involving the use of radio-isotopes

The Representatives,
Recognising that experiments involving the use of radio-
isotopes may jeopardise other experiments in the same
area;

Considering that prior notification of radio-isotope
experiments is desirable to allow time for consideration
of the effects of the proposed experiment,

Recommend to their governments that in cases where
expeditions of more than one Consultative Party may be
working in the same area, the governments involved
should exchange details of the proposed experiments six
months before these experiments begin.
