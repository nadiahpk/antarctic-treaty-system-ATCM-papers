Draft Recommendation

Permits for entry to Specially Protected Areas
(submitted by United Kingdom)

The Representatives,

Recalling  Article VIII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
Antarctic Fauna and Flora and the need to conform with paragraph 4(a) of
that article;

Considering that, in order to be effective, the existing prohibitions and
measures of protection relating to Specially Protected Areas need to be
amended;

Recommend to their governments that:

(1) They use their best endeavours to ensure that those provisions
of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora
which relate to Specially Protected Areas are complied with;

(2) In paragraph 2 of Article VIII of the Agreed Measures after the
words "further prohibit" they add a new sub-paragraph as follows:

"(a) The entry by any person into such an area,
except in accordance with a permit;"

and that the existing sub-paragraphs "(a)" and "(b)" be renumbered,
respectively, "(b)" and "(c)".
