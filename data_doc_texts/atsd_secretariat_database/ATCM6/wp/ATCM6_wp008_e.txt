Draft Recommendation submitted by Japan

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON ADVANCE NOTIFICATION
OF THE LAUNCHING OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
ROCKETS IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Noting that in recent years a number of countries
have launched scientific research rockets (sounding
rockets) in Antarctica and that the number of such
launchings is expected to grow in the years to come as
the scale and importance of scientific research
activities in Antarctica increase, and

Recognizing that as a result it will be increasingly
necessary to adopt adequate safety measures to prevent
possible danger, damage or injury to persons, fauna and
flora, facilities, vessels, aircraft and so forth on,
around or over the Antarctic continent, which might
otherwise result from the launching of rockets,

Recommend to their Governments as one such safety
measure that:

Each State which plans to launch rockets in the
Antarctic Treaty Area should notify all the Member
States in advance and as early as possible, through
diplomatic channels, of its planned launchings,
including information on the following:

1)
- 2 -

1) the place of launching

2) the time and date of launching or, alter-
natively, the approximate period of time
during which it is planned to carry out the
launchings

3) the direction of launching

4) the anticipated maximum altitude

5) the anticipated impact area

6) the type and other specifications of the
rockets to be launched.
