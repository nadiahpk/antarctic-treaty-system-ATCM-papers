DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY
THE UNITED KINGDOM

PERMITS FOR ENTRY TO SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS

The Representatives,

(1) Recalling Article VIII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation
of Antarctic Fauna and Flora ("the Agreed Measures") and the need to
conform with paragraph 4(a) of that Article;

(2) Considering that, in order to be effective, the existing prohibitions
and measures of protection relating to Specially Protected Areas need to
be strengthened;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They use their best endeavours to ensure that those
provisions of the Agreed Measures which relate to Specially Protected
Areas are complied with;

2. They take such action as may be appropriate to prohibit
the entry by any person into a Specially Protected Area except in
accordance with a permit issued under Article VI of the Agreed
Measures;
- 2 -

3. Until such time as this Recommendation may become 
effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty,
it shall, as far as feasible, be considered as a guide-line 
in the interim period.
