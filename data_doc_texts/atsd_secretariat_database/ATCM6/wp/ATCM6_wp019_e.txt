Recognizing that the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance
from its uncontaminated and undisturbed condition;

Recognizing, further, the increasingly urgent need to protect the

Considering that the Consultative Parties should assume responsibility
for the protection of the environment and wise use of the Treaty Area;

Recommend to their governments that

1) They invite the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research
(SCAR) through their National Antarctic Committees:
- 2 -

a) To identify the types and assess the extent of harmful interference which has occured in the Treaty Area as a result of man's activities;

b) To propose measures which might be taken to minimize harmful interference;

c) To consider and recommend scientific programs which will detect and measure changes occuring in the Antarctic environment;

2) They take interim measures to reduce known causes of harmful environmental intereference;

3) They review at the Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting the extent of the problem in the light of further available information and consider such measures as may be appropriate to prevent further harmful interference.
