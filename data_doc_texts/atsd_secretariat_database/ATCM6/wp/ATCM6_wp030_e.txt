MESSAGE FROM THE SIXTH CONSULTATIVE MEETING

TO STATIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC

(Submitted by the Australian Delegation)

"Representatives of the Signatories to the Antarctic Treaty have
just completed two-week discussions at the Sixth Consultative Meeting
as guests of the Japanese Government.  We have concerned ourselves
primarily with the matters designed to continue the preservation
of the Treaty area from unnecessary interference so that you may
advance your scientific programmes, whose results make such a valued
and admired contribution to man's knowledge of that area.

From this concluding meeting we send our cordial greetings and
wish you all a safe return to your families and friends during the
coming summer."

Note:  The message was unanimously adopted by the Meeting on
30 October 1970.  It was also agreed at the Meeting that the
message would be transmitted to all the stations concerned through
the SYOWA Station to which the message would be sent by the
Japanese Government.
