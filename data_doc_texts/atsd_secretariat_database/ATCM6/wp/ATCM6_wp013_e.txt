Draft Recommendation

Implementation of Article XII(2) of the Agreed Measures for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora

The Representatives,

Recalling  Article XII of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Fauna and Flora ("the Agreed Measures");

Noting  Recommendations I-IV and IV-19 which recognise the role of the 
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) in studying the status of 
species;

Recognizing  the need to ensure that the exchanges of information provided 
for in Article XII of the Agreed Measures are complete;

Recommend  to their governments that the following sentence be added at the 
end of paragraph 2 of Article XII of the Agreed Measures;

"If no permits have been issued by a Participating Government for 
the killing or capturing of any native mammal or native bird in 
the Treaty Area in the preceeding period of 1st July to 30th June, 
that Participating Government should so inform other Governments 
before 30th November each year".
