EXPERIMENTS USING RADIOISOTOPES

The representatives, recognising the need to preserve
the Antarctic from unnecessary environmental disturbance,
and considering, since experiments involving radio-isotopes
may jeopardise other such experiments in the same area,
that therefore maximum prior notification of radio-isotope
experiments is desirable, recommend to their governments
that they should exchange, through diplomatic channels,
six months before it is proposed that experiments using
radio-isotopes should take place, details of the proposed
experiments (in the manner set out at Annex A).
