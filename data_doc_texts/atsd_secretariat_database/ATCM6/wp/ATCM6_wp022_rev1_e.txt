DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY NEW ZEALAND,
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

COORDINATION OF ANTARCTIC SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING
THE USE OF RADIO-ISOTOPES

The Representatives,

Recognising that experiments involving the use of radio-isotopes
may jeopardise subsequent scientific investigations in the same locality,

Considering that prior notification of the use of radio-isotopes
is necesssary to allow time for consultations between Consultative
Parties whose investigators may wish to carry out experiments in the
same locality at a later date,

Considering that interim measures are required before agreement
is reached on the controlled use of radio-isotopes in the Antarctic
Treaty area,

Recommend to their Governments that, when their scientists are
planning experiments involving the use of radio-isotopes in the Antarctic
Treaty area, the Government concerned should provide details of such
experiments to other Consultative Parties as early as possible and
preferably six months in advance.
