MEASURES TAKEN BY FRENCH AUTHORITIES FOR THE
CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC FAUNA AND FLORA

The French Government, aware of the exceptional interest of
Antarctic and sub-antarctic fauna and flora, took measures as  early
as 1938, by the decree of October 27 of the same year, creating a
National Park sanctuary for certain species of birds and mammals found
in its austral possessions.

This measure was completed by the decree of February 27, 1960,
which prohibits bird and mammal hunting in the Terre Adeli region.

Law 66-400 of June 18, 1966, took steps to permit control of
seal hunting along the coast-line under French jurisdiction.

Finally, Decree N°. 17 of September 7, 1966, drawn up by the
Head of the T.A.A.F. (French Antarctic Terre Adeli) Territories, took
up the recommendations made at the 3rd Consultative Meeting, putting them
in force in statutory form.

These measures henceforth apply not only to Terre Adelie but
also, in a wider sense, to French Sub-Antarctic islands lying outside the
zone covered by the Treaty.

difficulties.
