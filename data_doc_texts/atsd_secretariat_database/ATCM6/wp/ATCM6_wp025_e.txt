DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

SUBMITTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM

EFFECTS OF TOURISTS AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENT
EXPEDITIONS TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Noting the increase in the number of tourists and other visitors who
are not sponsored by the Consultative Governments to the Antarctic
Treaty Area in recent years;

Considering that the activities of such people can have lasting and
harmful effects on scientific programmes and the Antarctic environment,
particularly in "Specially Protected Areas";

Desiring to ensure that visitors are offered the best view of Antarctic
stations compatible with the research programmes being undertaken;

Recalling Articles VII(5) and X of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommenda-
tions I-VI and IV-27:
- 2 -

Recommend to their governments:

1. that they should exert appropriate efforts to ensure that tourists
and all other visitors do not engage in any activity in the Treaty
Area which is contrary to the principles and purposes of the Antarctic
Treaty or the approved Recommendations made under it;

2. that those responsible for all expeditions to the Treaty Area not
organized by a Consultative Party but organized in, or proceeding
from, that Party's territory should be informed:

    (i) that notice of intention to visit any station be given to
    that station at least twenty four hours in advance of the
    expected time of arrival;

    (ii) that all visitors comply with any conditions or restrictions
    on their movements which the station commander may stipulate
    for their safety or to safeguard scientific programmes being
    undertaken at or near the station;

    (iii) that the visitors must not enter "Specially Protected Areas"
    designated in accordance with Article VIII of the Agreed
    Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

3. that advance notice of all expeditions to the Treaty Area not
organized by that Party, but organized in or proceeding from that
Party's territory, shall be given to the other Consultative Parties
and shall include the relevant information listed in Recommendation
I-VI.
