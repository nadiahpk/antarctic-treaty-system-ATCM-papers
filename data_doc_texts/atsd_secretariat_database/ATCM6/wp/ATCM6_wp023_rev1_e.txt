DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
SUBMITTED BY AUSTRALIA, FRANCE, NEW ZEALAND
AND THE UNITED KINGDOM

THE USE OF RADIO-ISOTOPES IN THE ANTARCTIC

The Representatives,

Recognising the need to minimise harmful disturbance to the Antarctic
environment,

Recognising that the uncontrolled use of radio-isotopes in the course
of scientific investigations may jeopardise the conduct of subsequent
investigations,

Recommend to their governments that through their National Antarctic
Committees, they invite the Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR) to consider the uses of radio-isotopes in Antarctic
scientific investigations and to propose comprehensive principles
which can be considered under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty to
control such uses.
