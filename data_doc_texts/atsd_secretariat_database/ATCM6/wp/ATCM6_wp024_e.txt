DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY CHILE

ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND BIOLOGICAL UNBALANCE IN THE ANTARCTIC

The Representatives, in accordance with the spirit of Article III
of the Antarctic Treaty,

Considering:

1. That the Antarctic continent is an ecosystem highly sensitive
to the negative influences of man and other foreign agents;

2. That its exceptional environment makes it a true natural system
which can and should be used for the benefit of world science;

3. That the problems of environmental pollution and biological
unbalance affecting our civilization oblige us to investigate
with the utmost urgency the negative effects of man's impact on
nature and possible measures of control;

4. That man's activities in the Antarctic environment serve as a
model for the above mentioned investigations insofar as the
Antarctic is a comparatively unpolluted ecologic system.
- 2 -

Recommend to their governments that

1. The Antarctic ecosystem be preserved and man's activities be 
eliminated insofar as possible with the exception of activities 
related to scientific investigations proper.

2. Investigations over a period of five years on man's impact 
on the Antarctic ecosystem be promoted, based on all scientific 
and related researches presently being conducted on that 
continent.

3. SCAR be urged to hold a symposium on pollution and 
biological unbalance in the Antarctic at the earliest possible 
date.
