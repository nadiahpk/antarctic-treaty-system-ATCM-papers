DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY JAPAN

ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF THE LAUNCHING OF SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH ROCKETS IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY AREA

The Representatives,

Noting that in recent years a number of countries have launched
scientific research rockets (sounding rockets) in Antarctica and that
the number of such launchings is expected to grow in the years to come
as the scale and importance of scientific research activities in
Antarctica increase, and

Recognizing that as a result it will be increasingly necessary to adopt
adequate safety measures to prevent possible danger, damage or injury
to persons, fauna and flora, facilities, vessels, aircraft and so
forth on, around or over the Antarctic continent, which might otherwise
result from the launching of rockets,

Recommend to their Governments as one such safety measure that:

Each Government which plans to launch rockets in the Antarctic
Treaty area should notify all the other Consultative Parties in advance
and as early as possible, through diplomatic channels, of its planned
launchings, in accordance with the standard tabular form Annexed hereto.
