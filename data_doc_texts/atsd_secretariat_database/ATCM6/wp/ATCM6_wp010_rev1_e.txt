Draft Recommendation on Telecommunications

(As amended by the Working Group on item 7,

on 20 October 1970)


The Representatives, considering,

     That an Antarctic telecommunications system serves the administrative,

operational, meteorological and other scientific needs of Antarctic

Stations;


     The need for the expeditious exchange in the Antarctic Treaty

Area of metreological information and the transmission of that information

to the Global Telecommunications System;


     The need to organize technically compatible routes for telecommunica-

tions both within, and out of, the Antarctic Treaty area;


     That the Antarctic telecommunications system needs to respond,

as may be necessary, to future changes in requirements for the trans-

mission of meteorological information and advances in telecommunications

technology.


The Representatives recommend to their Governments,

1.  That they adopt as guide lines the proposals contained in the

Final Report of the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting on Tele-

communications, Buenos Aires, 1969.


2.  And that in the plans for their expeditions they should provide

the organizational and technical arrangements necessary to implement

these proposals as far as practicable.
