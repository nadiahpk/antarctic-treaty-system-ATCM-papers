DRAFR RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED BY A WORKING GROUP

NEW ISLANDS

The Representatives,

Recognizing  the special scientific interest of new islands
formed by geological processes in the Antarctic;

Recalling  that the investigation of the colonization of an
uncontaminated area by animals and plants can easily be spoiled by
the presence of man;

Recommend  to their Governments that any new island formed by
geological processes in the Antarctic Treaty Area should be the subject
of immediate consultation through diplomatic channels with a view to
its consideration at the next Consultative Meeting in order to accord
it special protection for and that, until this can be done, they
should use their best endeavours to avoid contamination by human
interference.
