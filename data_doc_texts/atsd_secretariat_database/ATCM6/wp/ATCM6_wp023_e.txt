Draft Recommendation                                                

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)                                    

The use of radio-isotopes in the Antarctic                           

The Representatives,                                                 

Recognising the need to minimise harmful disturbance to the Antarctic
environment,                                                         

Recognisizg that the uncontrolled use of radio-isotopes in the        
course of scientific investigations may jeopardise the conduct of    
subsequent investigations,                                           

Recommend to their governments that they encourage the Scientific   
Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) to consider the uses of      
radio-isotopes in Antarctic scientific research with a view to       
preparing guidelines for the information of the Antarctic scientific
community.
