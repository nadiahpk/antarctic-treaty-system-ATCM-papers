Draft Recommendation on Telecommunications

(As amended by the Working Group on Item 7
on 21 October, 1970)

Considering,

That an Antarctic telecommunications system serves the administrative,
operational, meteorological and other scientific needs of Antarctic
Stations;

The need to exchange meteorological information as soon as
possible within the Antarctic Treaty Area and to transmit that information
with minimum delay to the Global Telecommunications System;

The need to organize technically compatible routes for tele-
communications both within, and out of, the Antarcti? Treaty Area;

That an Antarctic telecommunications system needs to respond,
as may be necessary, to future changes in requirements for the
transmission of meteorological information and advances in tele-
communications technology.

The Representatives recommend to their Governments,
- 2 -

1. That they adopt as guide-lines Proposals contained in 
the Final Report of the Second Antarctic Treaty Meeting 
on Telecommunications, Buenos-Aires, 1969.

2. That in the plans for their expeditions they should provide 
the organizational and technical arrangements necessary 
to implement these proposals as soon, and as far, as 
practicable.
