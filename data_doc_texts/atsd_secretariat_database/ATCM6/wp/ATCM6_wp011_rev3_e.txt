data to the Antarctic from the WWW;

That the requirements of the Consultative Powers for meteorological
information will change as the operational activities and the scientific
programs of their Antarctic stations evolve;

That the requirements of the Consultative Powers for meteorological
information will change as knowledge and understanding of the meteorology
