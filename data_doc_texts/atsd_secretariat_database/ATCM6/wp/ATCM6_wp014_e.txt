Statistics of animals killed and captured in the
Antarctic Treaty Area, 1964-69

(based on statistics provided under Article XII of the Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora)

(submitted by United Kingdom)

A summary of the returns of mammals and birds killed or captured
in the Treaty Area, 1964-69 is presented in the attached tables 1 and 2.

No returns have been made from Zone 6.  Birds and seals captured and
subsequently released are not included.

As regards seals, the results can be summarised as follows:

                  Crabeater         Leopard           Weddell
                  (Lobodon          (Hydrurga         (Leptonychotes
                  Corcinophagus)     Leptonyx)         Weddelli)

Permissible annual
catch*                200,000           15,000           10,000

Average annual catch
reported                 104                6              135

In the five years 1,290 seals are reported as having been taken.

These results are nowhere near the permissible catches even if there is
considerable under-reporting.  The returns also indicate that 1,050
birds have been taken, an average of 210 per year.  The taking of 3,651

Treaty Consultative Meeting

eggs (mainly from the Adélie penguin) is reported, an annual average
of 730 per year.  Clearly there is at present no serious direct threat to
Antarctic mammals and birds.  This does not, however, rule out the
possibility of very restricted over-exploitation of some local populations.

The trend in numbers of seals taken shown by table 2 is not real.

An examination of the returns by countries shows:

          1964/5  1965/6  1966/7  1967/8  1968/9
Expected returns   10      11      10      10      10
Actual returns     2       2       4       5       6

There has been an improvement in the number of returns, and in
some cases in the early years quite large numbers may have been taken but
not reported.  For example, several hundred crabeater seals have been
taken annually by the British Antarctic Survey but are only reported fully
for 1968/69, and Australia made no returns for 1965/66 and 1966/67 though
69 Weddell seals were taken in 1964/65, 115 in 1967 and 72 in 1968/69.
Thus the totals for the different seasons are not comparable.
