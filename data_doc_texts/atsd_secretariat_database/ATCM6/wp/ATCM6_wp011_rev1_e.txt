ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY

(WMO Document No.17.823/T/AA/TR, July 23, 1969)

Taking into consideration the meteorological information requirements
(processed or unprocessed) of the Member States of the Antarctic Treaty
as laid down at the Second Session of the Working Group on Antarctic
Meteorology and set forth in the letter to Member States from the
Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization No.17.823/T/AA/TR
dated July 23, 1969,

Considering the intentions of some Member States to establish
in Antarctica meteorological centers for the collection, processing
and dissemination of meteorological data;

The Representatives recommend to their governments that;

1) they take note of meteorological information requirements of
the Member States and also the list of the centers from which
necessary processed information is expected to be received,

2) as far as possible, they provide for necessary measures at their
Antarctic centers and stations to meet these requirements, with a
view to ensuring the timely collection (including expedition
ship and plane reports), processing (at data processing centers)
and dissemination of necessary meteorological information.
