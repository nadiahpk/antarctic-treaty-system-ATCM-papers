DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

SUBMITTED BY CHILE AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

MAN'S IMPACT ON ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT

The Representatives,

Considering that in the Antarctic Treaty Area the ecosystem is particularly
vulnerable to human interference;

Recognizing that the Antarctic derives much of its scientific importance
from its uncontaminated and undisturbed condition;

Recognizing, further, the increasingly urgent need to protect the
environment from human interference;

Considering that the Consultative Parties should assume responsibility
for the protection of the environment and wise use of the Treaty Area;

Recommend to their governments that

1) They invite the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research
(SCAR) through their National Antarctic Committees:
- 2 -AD!

a) To identify the types and assess the extent of human 
interference which has occurred in the Treaty Area as a 
result of man's activities;

b) To propose measures which might be taken to minimize 
harmful interference;

c) To consider and recommend scientific programs which will 
detect and measure changes occurring in the Antarctic environ-
ment;

2) They encourage research on the impact of man on the Antarctic 
ecosystem.

3) They take interim measures to reduce known causes of harmful 
environmental intereference;

4) Before the Seventh Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, they 
consider including in the agenda an examination of this matter 
in the light of any further available information.
