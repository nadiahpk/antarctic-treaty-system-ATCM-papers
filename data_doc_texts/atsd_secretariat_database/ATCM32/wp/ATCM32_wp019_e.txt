Background

3. ‘Base F, ’Wordie House is located at 65°15’S, 64°16’W on Winter Island in the Argentine Islands, Antarctic Peninsula.  It was built by the UK in 1947. The nearby British Faraday Research Station was closed as a British station in 1996, transferred to the Ukraine and renamed Vernadsky. The Base Commander at Vernadsky now holds the key to Wordie House and is responsible, with the UK contact point, for managing visits and looking after the site.

4. Following a conservation survey by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust in 1995, Wordie House was recognised for its historical importance and was adopted by means of Measure 4 (1995) as Historic Site and Monument No. 62 under the Antarctic Treaty. A heritage survey was carried out in February 2007 including a detailed description of the site with recommendations for its future management. Ukraine and the UK have worked closely with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators over the production of these site guidelines.

5. The attached Site Guidelines for Winter Island are submitted in a format consistent with those submitted in ATCM XXIX/WP001.
