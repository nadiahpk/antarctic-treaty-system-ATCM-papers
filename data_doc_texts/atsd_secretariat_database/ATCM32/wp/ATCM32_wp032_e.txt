Procedures for vehicle cleaning to prevent transfer of non-native species into and around Antarctica
CEP Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Summary
Following discussion at CEP XI on the issue of introduction of non-native species to Antarctica, the United Kingdom has developed simple practical guidelines to prevent the transport, via vehicles, of non-native species into and within the Antarctic Treaty Area.    
The United Kingdom would welcome comments on these guidelines (at Annex A to this paper) as the basis for the development and eventual adoption of formal CEP guidelines.  
Introduction
    1. The CEP has agreed  that Parties should make every effort to avoid the introduction of non-native species as such transfers are a major threat to biodiversity and could have serious negative impacts upon existing high-latitude ecosystems. 
    2. Vehicles, such as quad bikes, snow mobiles and plant machinery, are transported routinely into and around Antarctica by ship and aircraft from a wide range of locations.  As biological material (e.g. plant fragments, seeds, insects and microorganisms) and soil can become attached to vehicles during everyday use, when vehicles are moved from one location to another, these materials may also be transferred.  Transported vehicles therefore have the potential to act inadvertently as vectors that can carry biological organisms over large distances to areas where they are not normally found.  
    3. In view of this the UK has developed the following guidelines for use within its own operations to ensure that transfer of soil and biological material into and within Antarctica on vehicles is kept to an absolute minimum. We are aware that some other Parties have developed their own guidelines and we would encourage the CEP to build on these and develop a single set of guidelines for wider use and adoption by the ATCM.

Procedures for vehicle cleaning to prevent transfer of non-native species into and around Antarctica

    • The term ‘vehicles’ describes all wheeled, tracked or skied machinery, both powered or unpowered, that moves or is moved over ice and/or ice-free areas.  This including all snow mobiles, quad bikes, Snocats®, Hagglunds®, construction vehicles, trailers, snow blowers, heavy plant and aircraft that are transported to Antarctic by ship.
    • Vehicles shall be free of soil and biological material (e.g. plant fragments, seeds and insects) before transportation by aircraft or ships into the Antarctic Treaty Area.
    • Vehicles shall be free of soil and biological material before transportation by aircraft or ship between field sites or research stations within Antarctica and/or other regions.
    • All vehicles shall be thoroughly cleaned immediately before they are transported to the Antarctic Treaty Area.  Brand-new vehicles shall be inspected, and cleaned if necessary.
    • All vehicles shall be inspected to ensure they are free of soil and biological material, and if necessary cleaned, before transportation from one Antarctic field site or research station to another.
    • Where available and practicable, high-pressure steam cleaning of vehicles is recommended.  Alternatively, vehicles may be cleaned manually with a bucket of water and brush.  No soil, mud or biological material shall be left on the vehicle, including the wheels, wheel arches, tracks and inaccessible areas underneath the vehicle.  Vehicle accessories, such as forks and buckets, shall also be cleaned.  
    • Where possible, vehicle interiors, upholstery and mats shall be brushed and/or vacuum cleaned to remove any soil or biological material.
    • Following cleaning, care shall be taken not to contaminate the vehicles prior to loading onto the ship or aircraft.  If necessary, arrangements shall be made to thoroughly clean the vehicles at the loading site. 
    • Immediately before transportation, all vehicles shall be checked by a designated person [e.g. aircraft pilot, ship Chief Officer (or their nominated deputy)] to ensure they are free of soil, mud and biological material.  If any soil or biological organisms are found, the contaminated vehicle shall not be accepted for transportation until cleaned and re-inspected.  
    • If transported from outside the Treaty Area, where possible vehicles shall have their engines started before off-loading, to ensure rats and mice are not living in the engine compartments.
    • If a vehicle is known or suspected to have been transported to, or within, Antarctica without being cleaned, the incident shall be report immediately to the competent authority or national operator and the following action taken:  (1) If the un-cleaned vehicle has not been unloaded from the ship or aircraft, it shall be cleaned before off-loading.  The removed soil or biological material shall be collected into a sealed container and disposed of immediately by incineration or removed from the Treaty Area for disposal.  If this is not possible, the un-cleaned vehicle shall not be unloaded, but returned to the originating location.  (2) If the un-cleaned vehicle has been unloaded from the ship or aircraft, as far as it practicable, it should not be moved further.  This is to avoid spreading any attached soil or biological material to other locations in the local area.  The vehicle shall be cleaned to remove all soil and biological material.  Every effort shall be made to collect and isolate the detached soil and biological material in a sealed container before disposal by incineration or removal from the Treaty Area.
