About the role and place of COMNAP in the Antarctic Treaty System

The Antarctic Treaty System that took shape in the last years is based on two major institutional principles: political-legal and organizational. The text of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals of 1972, Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources of 1980, Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations and Measures of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) that have come into effect belong to the former. The international governance bodies established for different types of activity in the Antarctic according to special ATCM decisions belong to the latter. They include the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings convened pursuant to Article IX of the Treaty on a regular basis from 1961, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, set up based on Measure 1 (2003), adopted at ATCM XXVI, which began its work in 2004 and the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), established according to Article 11 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which began its work in 1997 at ATCM XXII. We can also include here the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), formed on the basis of ATCM Recommendations VIII-10 (1975), IX-2 (1977) and XI-2 (1981) according to Article VII of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which was signed in 1980 and came into effect in 1982, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), formed in November 1957 on the basis of the Special Committee on Antarctic Research by the International Council of Scientific Unions (now International Council for Science) before the start of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-1958 and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP), set up in 1989 replacing the SCAR Working Group on Logistics. The latter three organizations take part in the work of ATCM as observers – CCAMLR and SCAR on the basis of Recommendation XIII-2, 1985, beginning from ATCM XIV, and COMNAP – on the basis of Recommendation XVII-4, 1992 - from ATCM XVII. 
As can be seen, SCAR was established even before the Antarctic Treaty was signed. Its official status as an important element in the structure of the Antarctic Treaty System was stressed already in the Recommendations of ATCM I in Canberra, Australia, 1961 (Recommendations I-1, I-4) and in the Recommendations of the next ATCM (Recommendations IV-19, VI-9, VIII-11, XII-6, XIII-1, XIV-1). According to its status, SCAR is an independent international organization aiming to facilitate international scientific cooperation in the Antarctic and prepare necessary recommendations to the governments in respect of activity in the South Polar Region. At the same time, SCAR, as an international organization practically from the first steps of formation of the Antarctic Treaty System provides various consultative assistance in the ATCM decision-making as the main scientific expert. 
As noted above, COMNAP was created on the basis of the SCAR Working Group on Logistics, since it was SCAR, which at the stage of development of Antarctic studies after the end of the IGY was responsible for coordination of scientific projects and studies in the Antarctic. Direct implementation of such projects under the field conditions is intrinsically connected with planning and implementation of  sea, air and land transport operations, ensuring safety of these operations and life activity of the Antarctic stations, radio-communication and other means of information transfer, medical services to expedition personnel, design and construction of stations and field bases, fuel depots and other consumables, electrical power supply of the personnel location points, waste disposal, etc. Formally, this kind of work requiring substantial funds is not directly related to scientific projects and experiments, but this is however, one of the main elements for support of human activity in the Antarctic. To address these issues, a SCAR Group on Antarctic Logistics was set up at the SCAR XII Meeting in Canberra, Australia in 1972. Nevertheless the scope of work of this group did not fully correspond to the objectives of SCAR. So in 1989 in Hobart, Australia, the first meeting of the new international Antarctic body was held that originated from the aforementioned SCAR group and was named the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP). It is intended for organizing and holding forums, consultations and promoting cooperation between the countries, actively working in the Antarctic at the practical level. 
Appearance of COMNAP, as a separate body functioning independently from SCAR is due to understanding that the executive bodies of the national Antarctic programs can and should interact more effectively, establishing direct working relationships. Creating a new body as a public forum of Antarctic administrators was first of all necessitated by a significant increase of the number of countries that have created in the 1980s a complex, sometimes interrelated expedition infrastructures and by expanding non-governmental activity in the Antarctic due to appearance of tourist organizations with the Antarctic sphere of activity.
The notion “Manager of National Antarctic Program” means a national officer in charge of planning and implementing expedition activities of the country in the Antarctic. This person usually represents the organization financed by the Government of the Antarctic Treaty Party for fulfilling the national program. 
In recent years, COMNAP has prepared a significant number of documents contributing to international cooperation in the area of the Antarctic logistics. These are:
    • Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM) (1968 with annual revision);
    • Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM) (1989 with annual revision);
    • COMNAP Fuel Manual (2008);
    • International Antarctic Weather Forecasting Handbook (2004);
    • COMNAP-SCAR Antarctic Environmental Monitoring Handbook, (2000);
    • COMNAP Practical Guidelines for developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programs in Antarctica (2001);
    • COMNAP Guidelines for Advance Exchange of Operational Information on Antarctic Activities (revised 1999);
    • COMNAP Visitor’s Guide to the Antarctic (1995).

Besides, COMNAP on its own or in association with SCAR has prepared a large number of reference and information materials, presented at different COMNAP meetings on the problems of ship operations in the Antarctic, application of heavy types of fuel, environmental monitoring and protection, information exchange, etc. 
De facto, COMNAP has already been for a long time a real operating element of the Antarctic Treaty System, however, de-jure, ATCM has not adopted any measures or decisions to recognize this international Antarctic organization. At the same time beginning from ATCM XVII, COMNAP representatives are constantly invited to these meetings as observers. For some Consultative Parties, absence of the official status of COMNAP in the Antarctic Treaty System creates significant problems for organizing practical activity of their national Antarctic expeditions in the framework of COMNAP including annual membership fee payment to this organization. At the beginning of July 2008, the COMNAP XX Meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia has adopted a new COMNAP Constitution, which was distributed among the Meeting participants as Annex to the COMNAP Information paper at ATCM XXXII. This document describes in detail the spheres of activity and authorities of COMNAP participants. Taking account of COMNAP significance in the effective structure of the Antarctic Treaty System and a large practical contribution made by this international organization to promoting and strengthening cooperation between the national Antarctic programs in matters of  expedition studies of the South Polar Region, our Delegation believes that it is reasonable to use the adoption of the new COMNAP Constitution for preparing a Decision of ATCM XXXII in respect of official recognition of COMNAP status in the current Antarctic Treaty System. The Draft Decision is attached.
