Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Agenda Item CEP 7(d)
1. Summary
This paper provides details of a pilot study carried out by the UK to investigate the utility of a systematic conservation methodology in identifying important areas for conserving marine biodiversity.  It also outlines how the UK proposes to take this work forward.  We would welcome comments on the approach and look forward to further collaboration with interested Parties and observers.
2. Introduction
The establishment of spatial protection for marine biodiversity has been identified as a priority issue by both the CEP and CCAMLR. To assist with progress on this topic, the UK undertook a pilot study focused on the South Orkney Islands to investigate the utility of a systematic conservation planning methodology in identifying important areas for conserving marine biodiversity. In 2008, the UK presented ATCM XXXI IP3, which outlined the proposed methodology. Preliminary results were presented to the CCAMLR Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM) in 2008, and the methodology has been endorsed by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee as one possible approach to the selection of marine areas for protection (SC-CAMLR-XXVII Report, para 3.55). Information Paper 11 provides a detailed explanation of the South Orkney Islands pilot study methods and results.
The region surrounding the South Orkney Islands is one of the areas of highest heterogeneity in the Southern Ocean according to the CCAMLR pelagic bioregionalisation analyses, and it is therefore one of the areas likely to contain complex biological and environmental characteristics (SC-CAMLR-XXVII Report, para 3.54). It is a productive region which supports large numbers of pelagic predators, and it also has a rich diversity of benthic life. The South Orkney Islands are of considerable scientific and tourist interest, as well as being an important location for krill fishing. 
This paper aims to:
    1. Outline the objectives for marine conservation in the South Orkney Islands region.
    2. Demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a representative system of marine spatial protection for the South Orkney Islands region, using the full range of tools available under the Antarctic Treaty System.
    3. Outline the next steps required to select and implement appropriate spatial protection measures for the South Orkney Islands region.
3. Objectives for marine conservation in the South Orkney Islands region
Based on the provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection and the CCAMLR Convention, and the principles previously agreed by the CEP and SC-CAMLR, it is suggested that the objectives for marine conservation in the South Orkney Islands region could include:
    • Conserve biological diversity within representative examples of major marine ecosystems;
    • Protect outstanding environmental, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness values, and ongoing or planned scientific research;
    • Assist in planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid of possible conflicts, improve cooperation between Parties and minimize environmental impacts;
    • Maintain scientific reference sites to assist with distinguishing between the effects of harvesting and other activities from natural ecosystem changes, as well as providing opportunities for understanding the Antarctic marine ecosystem without interference;
    • Protect areas potentially vulnerable to impacts by human activities;
    • Maintain the integrity of important ecosystem processes.
    • Ensure that harvesting of marine living resources is coordinated with scientific research and other activities where appropriate, and that ecological relationships are maintained between harvested, dependent and related populations.
The South Orkney Islands pilot study identified areas that might be important in addressing some of these objectives (e.g. representative areas, scientific reference sites and important ecosystem processes). However, further work will be required to refine the analysis, and to determine the most appropriate areas for meeting the full range of objectives (see Section 4). 
4. Feasibility of establishing marine spatial protection in the region
Once the analysis to identify important conservation areas has been completed (e.g. using the approach demonstrated in Information Paper 11), the results can be used to inform decisions on the appropriate conservation actions to be applied to those areas. These actions are the protection or management mechanisms by which the defined targets (e.g. protection of 10% of each pelagic bioregion) are achieved in practical terms. Actions may range from implementing strict protection (e.g. highly protected areas such as ASPAs), to the definition of multiple-use areas (e.g. ASMAs), or the spatial management of specific activities (e.g. fisheries). Information Paper 11 describes the range of marine spatial protection and management tools that can be implemented by the ATCM and CCAMLR. In the case of the South Orkney Islands region, mechanisms available under the Protocol on Environmental Protection (ASPAs and ASMAs) could only be applied to the area south of 60°S. Other measures such as closed areas and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VME) Risk Areas might be considered for implementation by CCAMLR, if appropriate.
Some of these areas may allow for multiple uses, or may restrict only a single type of activity. However, it is also important to establish a network of protected areas that provides comprehensive protection for representative examples of major marine ecosystems, as required by the Protocol on Environmental Protection. 
The approval of both CCAMLR and the CEP would be required for some of these individual designations; however others could be implemented by one body independently. Overall, a spatial protection and management strategy for this region would be most effectively delivered with input from both CCAMLR and the CEP. This is particularly relevant for the South Orkney Islands region, since part of the study area is north of  60°S, and is therefore outside the Antarctic Treaty Area (but within the CCAMLR Area). 
5. Next steps towards a system of spatial protection for the South Orkney Islands
The UK plans to continue this work initiated in the South Orkneys pilot study during the 2000-10 inter-sessional period. Information Paper xx outlines the additional tasks needed to refine the systematic conservation planning analysis. Additional priorities for further work include:
    • Convene stakeholder and expert workshops to identify appropriate datasets, and develop specific conservation targets;
    • Collate benthic datasets and undertake MARXAN analysis for the benthic environment. Examine overlaps between the benthic and pelagic analysis outcomes;
    • Review existing terrestrial protected areas, to ensure appropriate linkages between the terrestrial, coastal and marine environments (management plan revisions have been initiated for ASPA Nos. 110, 111 and 114);
    • Assess the vulnerability and specific threats to marine habitats, processes and species;
    • Examine the feasibility with which protection or management measures might be implemented in the context of existing activities.

We aim to complete this analysis during 2009, and to begin developing scientifically-based proposals for new protected and managed areas in the region as appropriate. Collaboration with other interested Parties and SCAR would be welcomed, in order to ensure that the best available scientific information can be used.
