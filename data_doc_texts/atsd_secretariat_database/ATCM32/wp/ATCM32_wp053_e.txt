Site Guidelines for the Northeast beach of 
Ardley Peninsula (Ardley Island), 
King George Island (25 de Mayo Island), 
South Shetland Islands
Summary
Ardley Peninsula (Ardley Island) (62º13’ S; 58º54’ W) is located on the southwest coast of King George Island (25 de Mayo Island), east of the coast of Fildes Peninsula at Maxwell Bay (Guardia Nacional Bay /Fildes Bay). 
The island comprises the Antarctic Specially Protected Area No 150, protected due to the diverse assemblage of bird species that breed on it, but also considered as an area which receives tourist visitors since the time the island was proposed to be protected in 1991. During the last years, tourism increased from a few visitors to approximately a hundred visitors per season. Due to the proximity of the island to Fildes Peninsula (1 km approximately), personnel from the Stations established in the vicinities of Ardley Peninsula (Ardley Island) also used to visit the area during their rest time.
During the Antarctic summer season 2008/09, Chile and Argentina representatives completed an on-site assessment, in order to check the existing information and verify the potential measures to be included in the Guidelines. The format and contents of the draft follow those established in Resolution 2 (2006), with the objective of being coherent with the existing guidelines and those that are in the process of being adopted.  
Chile and Argentina, in compliance with Resolution 5 (2005), that adopted the “Site Guidelines for Visitors”, as well as with Resolutions 2 (2006), 1 (2007) and 2 (2008), which contain the guidelines for new sites, and taking into account that the Final Report of IX CEP consider useful to undertake site reviews and draft site guidelines for visited sites not already covered by visitor guidelines or other forms of site management, and using appropriate formats, with the valuable input of information provided by some tour operators, present these draft site guidelines to manage the presence of tourism on the Northeast beach of Ardley Peninsula (Ardley Island), King George Island (25 de Mayo Island), South Shetland Islands, for their consideration by the CEP XII and their eventual adoption by the XXXII ATCM.
The development of these Site Guidelines was seen as the most appropriate framework for management of tourist activities in the area just outside the ASPA in order to meet the goals of environmental stewardship of the area.
It is therefore proposed that: 
    •  Ardley Peninsula (Ardley Island) be included in the list of sites for which Site Guidelines have been prepared and endorsed by all Parties; and 
    •  the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat publish the Site Guidelines for Northeast beach of Ardley Peninsula (Ardley Island) on its website and in hard copy, as it has been done in other cases.
