Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on Term of Reference #4: Improving Management Plans and the Process for their Intersessional Review
Working Paper submitted by Australia on behalf of the SGMP

Abstract
In accordance with its fourth Term of Reference, the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) considered ways to improve Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review. The CEP is invited to consider the work undertaken by the SGMP during the 2008/09 intersessional period, including a review of past protected area recommendations (Attachment A) and an assessment of the suitability of standard wording for management plans (Attachment B). The CEP is also invited to consider the activities in the proposed SGMP work plan (Attachment C), including developing recommended standard wording and a template to promote consistency between management plans, reviewing the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, holding a workshop to share best practice in the management of Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, and examining options for considering management plans not referred for intersessional review.
Introduction
The CEP’s proposal to establish a Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) was approved by ATCM XXXI (Final Report paragraph 94) and the SGMP’s Terms of Reference were outlined in Appendix 3 to the CEP XI Final report. As agreed at CEP XI the SGMP was convened by one of the CEP Vice-chairs, Ewan McIvor from Australia (CEP XI Final Report paragraph 44). During the 2008/09 intersessional period the group was comprised of 17 members, including representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Germany, IAATO, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, SCAR, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States. 
This Working Paper reports on the SGMP’s activities under Term of Reference #4: ‘Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review.’ The SGMP’s activities under Terms of Reference #1 to #3 are detailed in a separate Working Paper ‘Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on Terms of Reference #1 to #3: Review of Draft Management Plans’. That paper also describes the general operation of the SGMP.
Timetable of work under Term of Reference #4
Acknowledging the relatively early timing of CEP XII and the importance of providing advice to proponents of draft management plans before the Antarctic season, the SGMP agreed it would first address tasks under Terms of Reference #1 to #3. The schedule of work under Term of Reference #4 was as follows:
    • 21 November to 17 December 2008: First discussion paper circulated by convenor and considered by SGMP members.
    • 17 December 2008 to 2 February 2009: Second discussion paper circulated by convenor and considered by SGMP members, including comments on three attachments. 
    • 6 to 16 February 2009: Draft Working Paper circulated by convenor and considered by SGMP members.
    • 20 February 2009: Final Working Paper submitted for consideration at CEP XII.
 
Improving management plans and the process for their intersessional review
In SGMP Note 1: CEP XII (29 July 2008) and SGMP Note 2: CEP XII (11 November 2008) CEP contact points were invited to suggest topics for consideration under SGMP Term of Reference #4. No suggestions were received. On 21 November 2008 the convenor circulated to SGMP Members a discussion paper suggesting several possible tasks for the group. There was general agreement to those proposals, and the work undertaken by the SGMP during the period between CEP XI and CEP XII is summarised in the following sections. 
    1. Review of protected area recommendations
The SGMP noted that the CEP had previously considered several recommendations arising from protected area workshops held by Treaty Parties, SCAR and IUCN, including recommendations on guidance for preparing and reviewing management plans. The group recalled an existing list of these recommendations appended to the CEP III Final Report and noted that, most recently, CEP VIII had agreed to consider that list of recommendations when assessing the future work of the Committee (CEP VIII Final Report, para. 187). 

Although some of the recommendations related to matters outside its Terms of Reference, the group agreed to conduct a review to help ensure the SGMP and CEP did not unnecessarily cover old ground or overlook good ideas from past discussions. The list from the CEP III Final Report was expanded to include protected area recommendations arising from the 2006 Workshop on Antarctica’s Future Environmental Challenges (ATCM XXIX / WP42). The group considered the status of each of these recommendations (see Attachment A).
The following actions and events since CEP III (2000) are particularly notable for substantially addressing many of the recommendations:
    • the entry into force of Annex V;
    • the adoption of several Resolutions pertinent to the Parties’ implementation of Annex V;
    • the establishment of the Secretariat, with its responsibilities for managing the protected areas database and electronic information exchange system; 
    • the establishment of the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans;
    • the proposal currently before the CEP to conduct a study of the environmental aspects and impacts of Antarctic tourism; and
    • the joint workshop to consider opportunities for improved collaboration and cooperation between CEP and SC-CAMLR to be held immediately prior to CEP XII.

The SGMP also wishes to bring to the CEP’s attention the following suggestions, regarding possible actions outside the SGMP’s Terms of Reference:
    1) The CEP might wish to consider further work to make the environmental domains analysis accessible, to assist with developing and reviewing new protected area proposals (see Recommendation A3).
    2) The CEP might wish to reconsider promoting the use of GPS to accurately define protected area boundaries. Such information could be managed in the protected area database (see point #3 below) and could be used in conjunction with Resolution 3(2008) to assess representativeness. The CEP might also wish to consider standardising protected area signs, where appropriate (see Recommendation A8).
    3) The CEP might wish to consider whether further work is required to ensure the full ‘target audience’ is aware that management plans are available via the ATS website (e.g. tour operators) (see Recommendation A18).
    4) The CEP and / or SGMP could consider what information about protected areas could usefully be contained in the ATS protected areas database (see Recommendation A18).
    2. Recommended standard wording for management plans
The Committee has previously acknowledged the benefit of promoting consistency between management plans, and has discussed the possibility of developing standard wording to help achieve that objective (see CEP IV Final Report, para. 67 and CEP XI Final Report, para. 34). The SGMP considered each of the standard components of management plans, and discussed whether these components were suited to the development of recommended standard wording (see Attachment B).
It was generally agreed that many components of management plans must provide site-specific information and are not suited to standard wording (see Table 1 below). To maximise consistency, these components should nevertheless closely follow the guidance given in the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide). The group considered that recommended standard wording might, however, be suitable for some components of management plans (see Table 1 below).
The SGMP felt strongly that management plans should continue to include sufficient site-specific information, and that it would be undesirable if the availability of recommended standard wording was to discourage proponents from developing and implementing site-specific or creative and innovative approaches to area protection and management. It was considered that the most appropriate approach might be to establish a ‘pool’ of suitable wording which could be drawn on and modified as necessary to reflect Area-specific consideration.
There was insufficient time to develop suggested standard wording during the intersessional period. Such work has been included as a possible task for Year 2 in the suggested SGMP work plan.

Requirements for reports
# Standard wording is not appropriate but a standard format could be applied.
*It is important that management plans include sufficient site-specific information. The development of recommended wording would not be intended to discourage proponents from developing and implementing site-specific or creative and innovative approaches to area protection and management.
    3. Management plan template
Related to discussions about improving consistency between management plans, the SGMP considered the possible benefits of developing a template into which proponents could add content in accordance with guidance given in the Guide and, where appropriate, utilising recommended standard wording. It was noted that such a template might usefully be incorporated into a revised Guide, and initial work to develop a template has been included as a possible task for Year 2 in the suggested SGMP work plan.
    4. Review of Guide to the preparation of management plans for ASPAs
The SGMP recalled that updating the Guide had been raised in the CEP in recent years, and agreed that conducting a review would appropriately fall under the SGMP’s responsibility for developing advice to the CEP on improving management plans. The group acknowledged this could be a substantial task, and it was agreed that a review / revision might best take place after some of the other proposed tasks, such as developing standard wording and a management plan template. Accordingly, a review of the Guide has been included as a possible task in Year 3 of the suggested SGMP work plan.
The SGMP noted that the Guide does not address ASMA management plans, and that no specific guidance for the preparation for ASMA management plans exists elsewhere. Now that seven ASMAs have been designated, there is a good opportunity to exchange best practice and to produce such guidance to assist Parties developing ASMAs. The convening of an ASMA workshop with the above aims has been included as a possible task in Year 3 of the suggested SGMP work plan.
    5. SGMP consideration of management plans not referred for intersessional review
The SGMP recalled that during contact group discussions at CEP XI a question was raised about whether it would be helpful for a subsidiary group to consider and provide advice on management plans that have not been referred for intersessional review. While noting that its Terms of Reference only require consideration of management plans referred by the CEP for intersessional review, the SGMP felt it might be worth giving further consideration to options to help improve the quality and consistency of the full suite of management plans. It was acknowledged that this could create a considerable increase in workload, and initial suggestions for possible approaches included:
    • the SGMP might only review new or revised plans prepared in accordance with available tools (e.g. the Guide, and possibly a template and standard wording, if developed); 
    • the SGMP need not consider revised plans determined by the proponent (who knows the Area best) to not require revision;
    • the SGMP could conduct a basic review of all existing plans over a year or two and advise the CEP on which plans might benefit from more detailed review by the SGMP; and
    • the SGMP could develop criteria for determining whether revision of an existing management plan is required.
It was agreed that this matter would require further discussion, which has been included as a possible task for Year 2 in the suggested SGMP work plan.
    6. SGMP work plan
The SGMP developed a suggested work plan to help structure its business and communicate its suggested activities to the CEP (see Attachment C). The suggested three-year SGMP work plan incorporates activities undertaken in Year 1 (the 2008/09 intersessional period), and a schedule for Years 2 and 3, incorporating the tasks outlined in greater detail above. The group notes that the suggested Year 3 activities would take place after the Committee’s scheduled review of the SGMP at CEP XIII, but hopes the suggested work plan will assist the CEP with its deliberations on the future work of the SGMP.
Advice to the CEP
The SGMP suggests that the CEP:
    1) considers the matters arising from the SGMP’s review of protected area recommendations and takes action as appropriate; and
    2) considers the suggested SGMP work plan at Attachment C and instructs the SGMP accordingly.

Workshop report submitted to ATCM XVII as WP 4 (SCAR)
    1. 
Ratification of Protocol and Annexes.
All ratified.  Annex V not yet in force. Further work outside scope of TOR
Annexes I-V in force. Annex VI not yet in force.
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    2. 
CEP rules of procedure to include development of PA system.
Rules implemented. Recommendation overtaken.  Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous.
    3. 
Encourage proposals for new protected areas (PA) to achieve adequate geographical and comprehensive environmental representation.
Some new emphasis on protecting a wider range of values but representation is still biased (at least geographically). Further work outside scope of TOR but it is hoped that guidelines under TOR (a) will encourage proposals.
The most recent analysis (by New Zealand – Morgan et al, referenced in WP 27 submitted to CEP XI) shows that representation is still geographically biased. It has been noted that it is important to consider vulnerability as well as environmental-geographic representation, and to take a risk-based approach to site protection (see, for example CEP XI Final Report, para 243). Identification of new “representative” areas can be informed by:
    • Resolution 1(2000): Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol.
    • Resolution 3(2008) “Environmental Domains Analysis for the Antarctic continent as a dynamic model for a systematic environmental geographic framework”.
The CEP might wish to consider further work to make the environmental domains analysis accessible, to assist with developing and reviewing new PA proposals.
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    4. 
SCAR to continue to receive and evaluate PA proposals in the form of draft management plans and advise CEP/ATCM.
Implemented.  Implicit in TOR (b).
SCAR participation in the review of management plans discussed at CEP XI (para 40) and SCAR invited to participate in SGMP 2008/09 intersessional review.
    5. 
PA proposals should not be rejected because of insufficient knowledge provided sufficient detail (and draft management plan) are included.
Implemented but not accepted throughout Treaty system? Further work outside scope of TOR.
Management plans are expected to evolve as the site becomes better understood. SGMP tasked with advising proponents on ways to improve consistency, clarity and likely effectiveness of management plans (ToR #2).
    6. 
SCAR should utilise revised 1977 ecosystem classification system as the environmental – geographic framework (Annex V) until an improved and agreed system, including comprehensive assessment criteria (e.g. wilderness, aesthetic), is adopted by an ATCM.
Did SCAR utilise it?  An improved environmental – geographic framework is not yet agreed. Relevant to TOR (a).  Classification matrix found helpful but not sufficient at Tromso and Peru workshops. 
See comments above against A3 and A4.
    7. 
SCAR and IUCN to continue to advise on PA, planning and design, research to enhance protection and distribution of a SCAR handbook on preparation of management plans.
Collaboration and advice continues?  SCAR produced guidelines adopted at XXII ATCM on preparation of management plans for ASPAs. No guide yet on ASMAs.  Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. See comments above against A4. As a CEP Observer, IUCN is able to contribute comments to the intersessional review of management plans. SGMP participation is open to CEP Members and Observers.
SGMP considering a workshop to share best practice in ASMA management and consider development of guidelines for ASMA Management Plans.
    8. 
PA boundaries should be defined by natural features where appropriate, fixed by GPS where possible, and standardised signs should be erected at them.
Partly reflected in Annex V and guidelines (TOR (a)).  Signs are not standardised or commonplace. Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. The Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide) promotes the use of natural features to define PA boundaries, and many areas are defined as such. Signs might not be appropriate in some cases.
The CEP might wish to reconsider promoting the use of GPS to accurately define protected area boundaries. Such information could be managed in the protected area database (see comments against A18 below) and could be used in conjunction with Resolution 3(2008) to assess representativeness.
The CEP might also wish to consider standardising PA signs, where appropriate.
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    9. 
Management plans should identify values, management objectives, and activities to be observed.  COMNAP support should be sought.
Guidelines adopted at XXII ATCM contain these aspects. When the ATCM approves management plans, Parties and associated organisations (e.g. COMNap) implement them. Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. SGMP tasked with advising proponents on ways to improve consistency, clarity and likely effectiveness of management plans (ToR #2).  SGMP participation is open to CEP Members and Observers.
    10. 
When existing PAs are reclassified in accordance with Annex V, new management plans should be prepared.
Implemented and underway. Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous.
    11. 
Standard methodology for site surveillance, monitoring and co-operative management.
SCAR reporting form adopted by XXII ATCM.  Co-operative management has improved but more work needed. Further work outside scope of TOR.
Cooperative management has improved with the development of ASMA designated by multiple Parties.
Guidance for the review and inspection of PAs is given in Resolution 4(2008): Checklist for inspections of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas. 
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    12. 
Issue of permit to enter PAs to require compliance with management plan; permits should be subject to review.
Standard practice in most countries but difficult to enforce everywhere. Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. Permit for entry to ASPAs is a requirement of Annex V Article 3.4. To be addressed as part of proposed SGMP work to develop recommended standard working for management plans.
    13. 
Parties inspect PAs at not more than five year intervals to ensure use in accordance with management plans; inspections to be co-ordinated.
Practice being adopted but backlog exists. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A11.
    14. 
Protection measures for Historic Sites and Monuments.
Implemented. Further work outside scope of TOR.
The Parties adopted Resolution 5(2001): Guidelines for handling pre-1958 historic remains.
Protection of HSMs discussed at CEP XI, when the Committee agreed to ask Chile to coordinate an intersessional review of proposed HSM guidelines (final report para 217). 
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    15. 
Historic and scientific values of abandoned work sites to be considered before clean-up sanctioned.
Generally implemented. Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. See comments above against A14.
    16. 
Conservation principles for assessment and management of tourist operations be considered.
IAATO has prepared such principles but responsibility for management resides with Treaty Parties.  Not all tourist operators belong to IAATO. Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. Tourism and NGO activities identified as Priority 1 in five-year work plan adopted at CEP XI. The Parties have adopted site-specific guidelines for 18 sites visited by tourist groups (see Resolution 2(2008) Site Guidelines for Visitors). France is leading informal discussions about developing general guidance for visitors (see CEP XI Final Report para 238). CEP currently considering the outline for a study into the environmental aspects and impacts of Antarctic tourism (CEP Circular 3 / CEP XII).
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    17. 
Research into and monitoring of tourist activities and impacts to facilitate planning and management.
Some research and monitoring is and has been undertaken. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A16.
    18. 
Establishment of PA database to allow access to management plans and site data to be considered.
Some relevant databases have been established at national sites. Wider establishment still under discussion at ATCMs and CEP. Further work outside scope of TOR.
Antarctic Protected Areas Information Archive of management plans developed by the United Kingdom and transferred to the Secretariat (see CEP V, paras 92-93; and CEP VI, para 148).
The Secretariat has linked all management plans to the ATS database, which is accessible via the ATS website and has replaced the APAIA. The Secretariat is also developing a new protected areas database which will incorporate a geographic information system (GIS).
The CEP might wish to consider whether further work is required to ensure the full ‘target audience’ is aware that management plans are available via the ATS website (e.g. tour operators).
The CEP and / or SGMP could consider what information about protected areas could usefully be contained in the ATS protected areas database.
    19. 
Information in four languages to be made available to all visitors to ensure compliance with conservation measures.
Not implemented in all languages. Documents important for protection of Antarctica should be translated into as many visitors’ languages as possible, especially for operations near protected areas (e.g. Recommendation XVIII-I has been translated into the four official languages plus Italian, Chinese, Japanese and German). Further work outside scope of TOR.
As previous. Translation of maps continues to be an issue. As appropriate, proponents of management plans could find suitable ways to ensure that provisions are effectively communicated to visitors.
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    20. 
Parties to ensure that expeditions shall oblige pilots, captains, officers, crew and passengers to comply with conservation measures and PA regulations.
Generally implemented. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A19. The Wildlife Avoidance Manual highlights protected areas in the Antarctic Peninsula region, and is widely used by pilots and ship’s officers.  
    21. 
CEP should develop an information strategy for data collection etc associated with PA management.
Under preliminary discussion. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A11 & A18.
    22. 
Parties to consider opportunities for applying international PA designations to areas of exceptional and universal conservation value and explore the possibility of ‘Antarctic Heritage Landscapes’.
Discussed at subsequent workshops and briefly in ATCM’s and CEP. Indirectly relevant in part to TOR (a).
Antarctic protected area designation is conducted within the Annex V framework.
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
B. Treaty Parties – NGO Workshop, Tromso, 28 May 1998 (Njaastad 1998)
Workshop report submitted to ATCM XII / CEP I as WP 26 (Norway)
    1. 
That the ATCPs, the CEP, SCAR and CCAMLR, take urgent steps to identify possible new protected areas in the following categories: areas kept inviolate from human interference (Annex V, Article 3(2a)); representative examples of ecosystems (Annex V, Article 3 (2b)).
Recommendation A.3 applies here.  Meaning of “representative” examined in TOR task (a). Partly relevant to TOR part (a).
See comments above against A3.
    2. 
That the CEP, in collaboration with SCAR and IUCN, should develop new systems for classifying protected areas in Antarctica making good use of existing knowledge and methods (and taking account of all types of area referred to in Annex V, Article 3.2).
Similar to A.6 and A.22. Not yet agreement or formal development in Treaty system.
Recommendation consistent with TOR part (a).
SATCM XII adopted Resolution 1(2000): Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol.
Further work outside SGMP ToR.
    3. 
That the ATCPs through the CEP examine ways of establishing and maintaining a database on Antarctic protected areas, which could be made accessible electronically.
Similar to A.18. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A18.
    4. 
That the ATCPs, through the CEP, undertake a gap analysis based on the values for site protection identified in Article 3 of Annex V, in order to make recommendations for new protected areas.
Argentine paper at Peru workshop useful but author considered more systematic work was required. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A3.
    5. 
That the ATCPs, the CEP, SCAR and COMNAP should consider means by which adopted management plans and the Guidelines on the Preparation of Management Plans can be made as widely available as possible.
Overlap with A.18, 19 and B.3.  Under discussion. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A18. The Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans is readily available from the ATS website.
    6. 
That the CEP should develop criteria for the five year review of management plans as required by Article 6 (3) of Annex V, and establish a standardised reporting system for the exchange of information as required by Article 10 (1c) of Annex V.
See A.11.  Discussed at CEP II, Peru workshop.  Implicit in TOR (b) and also (a).
The checklist used by the SGMP to review management plans and the checklist for inspections of ASPAs and ASMAs adopted in Resolution 4(2008) provide useful guidance to proponents about matters to consider in the five year review of management plans. The SGMP could consider, perhaps as part of a review of the Guide, whether it would be useful to develop criteria to help determine whether revision of an existing management plan is required.
The Electronic Information Exchange System administered by the Secretariat provides a standardised reporting system for Annex V information exchange requirements.
    7. 
That the CEP should consider how it can best review plans for ASPAs proposed because of their wilderness, aesthetic or historic values given that consideration of such values lies outside the relevant competence of SCAR and CCAMLR.
Information papers by UK and NZ at CEP I and II provided background. TOR (b) implicitly includes this.
See comments against B6 above.  Guidance on designating ASPAs for these values is given in Resolution 1(2000): Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol. Developing an understanding of wilderness values is identified as a Priority 2 task in the five-year work plan.
    8. 
That the CEP consider establishing a sub-group(s) to address elements of the protected areas system, and select appropriate convenors for such cub-groups.
Intersessional group for EIA useful model of intersessional subgroups.  Discussed at Peru workshop and CEP II.  Part of TOR (b).
Subsidiary Group on Management Plans established at CEP XI / ATCM XXXI, to be reviewed after a 2 year period (CEP XI Final Report, para 43 and Appendix 3). 
    9. 
That the Terms of Reference of any sub-group be determined by the CEP.
Accepted and required by CEP rules of procedure. Discussed at Peru workshop and CEP II.  Implicit part of TOR (b).
SGMP Terms of Reference outlined in Appendix 3 to the CEP XI Final Report
    10. 
That the CEP should examine the timelines for the submission and processing of proposed management plans with a view to improving the process, where possible.
UK paper at Peru workshop. Implicit part of TOR (b).
SGMP Term of Reference #4
C. Treaty Parties – NGO workshop, Lima, 22 – 23 May 1999 (Peru 1999)
Workshop report submitted to SATCM XII / CEP III as WP 37 (Peru)
    1. 
That the CEP elaborates the existing framework for protected areas in Antarctica, which draws on the schema (identified).
Overlap with A.6, B.2? ICG TOR (a).
See comments above against B2. 
    2. 
That the CEP considers the need for further elaboration of an Antarctic conservation strategy.
TOR (c) (This paper).
CEP III endorsed the conclusion of the 2000 ICG that further elaboration of an Antarctic conservation strategy was not needed at that point, given the provisions of the Protocol and its annexes (CEP III Final Report para 89). The CEP five-year work plan adopted at CEP XI also provides guidance regarding action on significant environmental issues.
Further work outside scope of SGMP ToR.
    3. 
That in selecting new protected areas, a range of tools be used, including analysis of environmental risk, quality and feasibility.
TOR (a).
Such tools are outlined in Resolution 1(2000): Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol.
Further work outside scope of SGMP ToR.
    4. 
When preparing and periodically reviewing protected area management plans [for which it has been assigned responsibility], the Party compile inventories of the values found in those areas, and assess the effectiveness of protection for the designated assemblages.  In addition consider whether there is inappropriate duplication between areas, and whether there are other assemblages which need inclusion in the protected area.
Advice to CEP II. Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against B6.
    5. 
A Contact Group  should be established  by the CEP, in accordance with Rule 9 of the CEP Rules of Procedure with  the following functions:
    1. Provision of advice to proponents and the CEP on new management plans.
    2. Reminding proponents when revisions to existing plans are due.
    3. Provision of advice on such revisions.
    4. Monitoring the operation of plans and advising the CEP / Parties accordingly as requested by CEP.
Not addressed

D. IUCN Antarctic cumulative impacts workshop, Washington, 18-21 September 1996 (De Poorter, M and Dalziell, JC (Editors) 1996)
Workshop report submitted to ATCM XXI as IP61 (IUCN)
    1. 
The use of ASMAs and ASPAs should be encouraged as a tool to manage cumulative impacts.
Further work outside scope of TOR.
Annex V Article 4.2(a) clearly provides that ASMAs may include areas where activities pose risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts. ASPAs could be applied in a similar fashion, where the situation suggests that stricter permit restriction on entry may be more appropriate than adherence to a code of conduct. As appropriate, it is within the SGMP’s Terms of Reference to advise proponents on suitable Management Activities, including exchange of information or cooperative action by Parties where there is a risk of cumulative impacts (noting that the Parties active in the area will be best placed to consider opportunities for cooperation).
Further work outside scope of SGMP ToR.
    2. 
International cooperation is essential and should be strongly encouraged in the establishment and management of protected areas.
Implicit in TOR.
There are many exampled of jointly proposed and jointly managed protected and managed areas, and such cooperation should continue to be promoted. The SGMP includes representatives from many Treaty parties. Where appropriate, the SGMP can advise on including in management plans measures to encourage international cooperation.
    3. 
In the management of these areas, steps should be taken to avoid or minimise the increased risk of cumulative impacts [arising] from the possibility that protected areas attract further scientific activities.
Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against D1.
    4. 
“Pristine” areas should be identified and consideration given to designations under Annex V to achieve the appropriate level of protection of them (which could include exclusion of activities). 
Further work outside scope of TOR.
See comments above against A3.

    2. 
Standing Group to develop terms of reference and a work plan
n/a
See comments above against B9.
    3. 
Collaborate with CCAMLR on MPAs
n/a
The CEP has on several occasions committed to work closely with CCAMLR on MPAs (see for example, CEP XI Final Report para 255) and cooperation with CCAMLR is a priority 1 action in the five-year plan. Opportunities for cooperation and collaboration on MPAs will be discussed at the 2009 CEP / SC-CAMLR workshop.
Further work outside scope of SGMP ToR.
    4. 
Do an audit and gap analysis of the protected areas system
n/a
See comments above against B4.
    5. 
Do a risk analysis to identify issues requiring immediate attention
n/a
This recommendation is somewhat unclear. The SGMP is considering issues to be addressed which relate to improving management plans and the process for their review.
    6. 
Develop an agreed understanding of intrinsic / wilderness values

Attachment B. Assessment of suitability of standard wording in management plans
Management plan section
Is standard wording suitable?
Comments
Introduction
No
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.1 of the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide) but standard wording is not appropriate as the Introduction will be specific to the Area in question.
Description of Values
No
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.2 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the Description of Values will be specific to the Area in question.
Aims and Objectives
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar Aims and Objectives and wording. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. For example, the Guide includes suggested wording for sites containing a marine area. Other site-specific aims and objectives could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given in section 3.3 of the Guide.
Management Activities
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar Management Activities. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Site-specific management activities should of course be included, and should follow the guidance given in section 3.4 of the Guide. As indicated in the Guide, if no special management activities are required, this section should state “None required”.
Period of Designation
Yes, in part*
If there is no expiry date, as is the case for most Areas currently, standard wording could be used (e.g. “Designated for an indefinite period”.)
Description of the Area
No
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.6 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the Description of the Area will be specific to the Area in question.
Geographical co-ordinates, boundary markers and natural features
No
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.6.1 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the Description of the Area will be specific to the Area in question.
Access to the area
No
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.6.2 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the Description of the Area will be specific to the Area in question.
Location of structures within and adjacent to the site
No
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.6.3 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the Description of the Area will be specific to the Area in question.
Location of other protected areas in the vicinity
No (but standard format could be applied)
Should follow the guidance given section 3.6.4 of the Guide but standard wording is probably not appropriate as the Description of the Area will be specific to the Area in question. However, plans could use a standard format for reporting the location of other protected areas in the vicinity, such as a dot-point list of areas, each giving the area number, area name, coordinates and approximate distance and direction (e.g. ASPA 167, Hawker Island, 68°35’S, 77°50’E, 22 km to the north-east)
Special Zones within the Area
No
If there are special zones, this section should follow the guidance given section 3.7 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the content will be specific to the Area in question. If there are no special zones, standard wording could be used (e.g. “There are no special zones within the Area.”). Consideration could be given to standardising zone definitions.
Maps
No (but standard format could be applied)
The description of maps in the main body of the management plan could follow standard a format, but standard wording is not appropriate as the details will be specific to the Area in question. Production of the maps themselves should follow the detailed guidance given in Appendix 3 of the Guide. 
Supporting Documentation
No (but standard format could be applied)
Should follow the guidance given in section 3.9 of the Guide but standard wording is not appropriate as the Description of the Area will be specific to the Area in question.
Terms and Conditions for Entry Permits
Yes, in part*
Many ASPA management plans include a series of general permit conditions at the beginning of this section. Suggest adding a standard sub-section “General permit conditions”. 
Many ASPA management plans share similar general terms and conditions for entry permits. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. For example, standard wording to reflect the requirement in Annex V Article 7.3 for permit-holders to carry a copy of the permit while in the Area. Other site-specific general permit conditions could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10 of the Guide.
Access to, and movement within or over, the Area
Yes, in part*
This section should follow the guidance given in section 3.10.1, and most content will be site specific. It is possible that some standard wording could be applied. For example, it might be appropriate to make reference to agreed guidelines such as the Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft Near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica or, where appropriate, simply state that “No helicopter landings are allowed.”
Activities which may be conducted in the Area
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar statements about activities which may be conducted in the Area. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Site-specific activities should of course be included, and should follow the guidance given in section 3.10.2 of the Guide.
Installation, modification or removal of structures
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar statements regarding the installation, modification or removal of structures. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Site-specific activities should of course be included, and should follow the guidance given in section 3.10.3 of the Guide.
Location of field camps
No
Where field camps are permitted, this section generally contains site-specific information, and should follow the guidance given in section 3.10.4 of the Guide. Where camping is not allowed, standard wording could be used (e.g. “No field camps are allowed.”) 
Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the site
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar statements about restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the site. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Other site-specific restrictions could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10.5 of the Guide.
Taking of, or harmful interference with, native flora and fauna
Yes, in part*
Most management plans share similar statements about taking of, or harmful interference with, native flora and fauna. Most plans make reference to Article 3 of Annex II to the Protocol which prohibits taking or harmful interference except in accordance with a permit. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Other site-specific provisions could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10.6 of the Guide.
The collection, or removal, of materials not imported by the permit holder
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar statements about the collection, or removal, of materials not imported by the permit holder. Recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Other site-specific provisions could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10.7 of the Guide.
Disposal of waste
Yes, in part*
Many management plans share similar statements about the disposal of waste and, consistent with the Guide, most management plans require that all wastes be removed from the site. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Other site-specific provisions could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10.8 of the Guide.
Measures that may be necessary to continue to meet the aims of the Management Plan
Yes, in part*
Some management plans share similar statements about measures that may be necessary to continue to meet the aims. A pool of recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Other site-specific measures could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10.9 of the Guide.
Requirements for reports
Yes, in part*
Most management plans share very similar statements about requirements for reports.  Recommended standard wording could be developed and drawn on as appropriate. Other site-specific measures could of course be included, and should follow the guidance given section 3.10.10 of the Guide.

* It is important that management plans include sufficient site-specific information. The development of recommended wording would not be intended to discourage proponents from developing and implementing of site-specific or creative and innovative approaches to area protection and management.
