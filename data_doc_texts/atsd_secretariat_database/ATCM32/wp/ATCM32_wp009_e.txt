Report on informal discussions about the non-specific information contained in the Site Guidelines for Visitors to Antarctica
Working Paper presented by France
Abstract
Following the discussion held at CEP XI on the Site Guidelines, France proposed to convene an informal discussion during the intersession in order to identify in the current guidelines the recommendations which are not strictly related to the characteristics of each site and to consider the possibility to make the site guidelines more specific, using a generic cover to provide general recommendations applicable for environmental aspects of tourism activities in Antarctica. During these discussions, the idea of revising the environmental elements of Recommendation XVIII-1 was raised. If agreed, an ICG could be established by the CEP to make progress on developing generic guidance suitable to accompany site guidelines and considering at the same time the environmental elements of Recommendation XVIII-1.
Background
Following the adoption of the four first Site Guidelines by the Resolution 5 in 2005, several other Site Guidelines have been prepared and adopted. At the end of 2008, a total of 18 Site Guidelines were in place. They are unanimously recognized as a major tool to manage vulnerable or heavily visited sites and to protect their environment. Several documents (e.g. ATCM XXIX WP2) pointed out the need for an efficient systematic review of the guidelines, in parallel of the elaboration of new guidelines for an increasing number of sites. This point was also mentioned in Resolution 5 (2005), recommending that administrative procedures be introduced to ensure that the text of Site Guidelines can be modified readily to reflect changing environmental circumstances and that any proposed amendment to existing Site Guidelines should be discussed by the CEP which should advise the ATCM accordingly.
At CEP XI, the review of the Site Guidelines was introduced in the CEP 5 yr workplan with the following actions: 1) review site specific guidelines as required, and 2) provide advice to ATCM as required, and with the possible establishment of a standing group at CEP XII – Baltimore. This action received a high priority (Priority 2).
Based on the structure and content of the current Site Guidelines, France noted at CEP XI that several elements of the guidelines are not specific to the sites but are related to recommendations which could be applied everywhere in Antarctica, and for most of them, by all kind of visitors. It was also noted that some of these guidances are already provided by existing Recommendation (e.g. Recommendation XVIII-1) or Resolution (e.g. Resolution 4-2007). 
In consequence, in the context of the 2nd priority given to the review of the Site Guidelines in the 5 years CEP workplan, France suggested identification of such standard wordings which are not directly related to the characteristics of each site in order to prepare a generic cover sheet for use with the specific Site Guidelines.
France agreed at CEP XI (para 238 of the final report) to work informally with interested Parties on this issue during the intersession period and to report back to CEP XII. 
The discussion was conducted using the CEP web forum, in two successive stages: 1) identification of possible non-specific criteria currently used in the Site Guidelines, and 2) validation of a first list of non-specific criteria and discussion on the different options for the preparation of a generic document compiling general recommendation to visitors in the sites visited by tourists (or to a broader audience).
Results of the discussions
Discussion 1: identification of non-specific criteria
The first stage focused on the identification of non-specific information contained in the 18 Site Guidelines adopted by ATCM. For this purpose, a compilation of these Site Guidelines was produced in an Excel sheet in order to have a good overview of the current documents and to identify the common criteria. At this stage, France proposed its own selection of what we consider as non-specific criteria, with several remarks, and participants were asked to provide comments on this first proposition.
We received answers from 8 Parties (Argentina, Australia, Ecuador, France, India, New-Zealand, United-Kingdom and United-State) and from IAATO and ASOC. 
Among the general comments, several important remarks were made by the participants, recalling the importance of the Site Guidelines for the management of highly visited and sensitive sites. 
At this stage, most of the participants agreed on the potential interest to have a generic cover sheet or a general code of conduct. Several participants made reference to Recommendation XVIII-1 Guidelines for Tourism (Kyoto, 1994) and Resolution 4 (2007) Ship based tourism. It was recommended to consider how the generic elements from this general document might interact with these ATCM recommendations. It was also pointed out the necessity to avoid duplication or contradiction, and also avoid having a proliferation of advice to visitors, in different places and different forms.
Detailed answers from the participants are available on the forum website and were used in the preparation of the second stage of discussion.
Discussion 2: generic guideline and option to move forward
For this second stage of discussion, France provided a compilation of:
    • the possibly non-specific criteria currently used in Site Guidelines,
    • other generic elements which appear in Recommendation XVIII-1 and Resolution 4 (2007),
    • other recommendations mentioned in a set of documents which could be considered as very general (e.g. management plans of ASMA 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7; Environmental Code of Conduct for Australian Field Activities in Antarctica; A Visitor's Introduction to Antarctica and its Environment http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/visitor.html; IAATO guidelines 2007 slide layout). 
This list of documents is not exhaustive but it was used in a first approach to demonstrate the multiplicity of recommendations. The table in Annex A provides a list of elements which could be included in a generic recommendation.
A total of 7 Parties (Argentina, Australia, France, India, New-Zealand, South Africa and United-Kingdom), IAATO and ASOC participated in this second round of discussion 
Three questions were asked of the participants during this second round of informal discussions:
1. Do you agree with this list of generic elements (Annex A) and do you think that they can be included in a generic guideline for tourism and NGO activities in Antarctica? 
Most of the participants agreed with this list of elements as a basis for discussion of a generic guideline. However, some of them could be also maintained in the Site Guidelines, according to possible specificity of the sites: e.g. the resting period for wildlife which is a precautionary management strategy for the most visited sites. It was noted that general and specific recommendations are not always mutually exclusive.
More specific comments were provided for several proposed elements (see details on the CEP web forum).  For example:
    • A discussion occurred on the approach distance from wildlife. France and other parties would like to see a distinction between breeding and non breeding animals. Moulting is also a sensitive period of the life cycle. In addition, the concept of “change in behaviour” to serve as an alert was recalled but it was noted that more subtle changes (heart rate, physiological responses…) may occur before the animal changes its behaviour. Determining the most appropriate approach distance from wildlife in the context of a precautionary approach remains obviously a point to debate. The ATCM XXXI - WP12 presented by SCAR at Kiev would be a good basis for such a discussion. 
    • More detail on the protection of vegetation should be provided in a generic document, but specific recommendations may occur in the Site Guidelines when particular vegetation value is present and mapped.
    • Non-native species and methods to avoid the risk of their introduction are generally not well covered in presently available guidance. Participants felt that this element would benefit from updating, based on the current work of the CEP on this highest priority issue.
    • Another discussion concerned the definition of a ship as a vessel carrying more than 12 passengers. Participants noted that the provisions of the guidelines apply to all visitors and the restriction to vessels carrying more than 12 passengers concerns only the number of visits permitted per day. 
    • The issue of the environmental impact of small boats was also discussed and it was suggested that recommendations, drawing on existing guidelines could be included in a separate generic document.
    • Spreading of information was also tackled and it was suggested to explore the possibility to work in conjunction with Antarctic chart sellers / distributors.
2. Do you think that this document should be drafted as a generic cover of the Site Guidelines or as a revision of Recommendation XVIII-1 in order to avoid multiplication of guidelines and to assure consistency in the advices provided to visitors? 
Most of the participants supported the idea of a revision (or replacement) of the Recommendation XVIII-1 which is not yet in force. Independently of the Site Guidelines, some participants felt that this recommendation could benefit from updating and improvement. For example, 
    • this Recommendation was produced before the Madrid Protocol entered in force and several sentences could be simplified; 
    • it would be better to make reference to noise rather to the use of guns or explosive; 
    • Information on how minimizing the risk of introduction of non-native species should be more developed, including the risk of between Antarctic sites transfers;
    • The text about protected areas is very general and may be ambiguous. A clear distinction between ASPA and ASMA should be made and the prohibition to enter into an ASPA should be clearly stated.
Recommendation XVIII-1 is structured to provide guidance to individual visitors, and separate guidance to operators and guides - in effect, two sets of guidelines. Several participants think that it will be important to maintain this approach – some elements identified are useful to the average visitor, while others are better understood and interpreted by those organising visits and guiding ashore. 
One suggested option was a new resolution with attached guidelines, which might include separate guidelines for individual tourists, guidelines for operators, and possibly others.  This would update and replace the environmental elements of Recommendation XVIII-1. Such guidelines could be readily updated. The relevant guideline would then form a cover sheet for the site-specific guidelines. This would mirror the way that the resolution for the site specific guidelines works.
It was noted that multiplication of different guidelines, code of conduct etc.. should be avoided. Revision of the Recommendation XVIII-1 guidelines would help avoid proliferation of advice to tourists. The final document could be formatted in such a way as to serve both as a standalone document (for activities in all sites in Antarctica) and as a supplement / cover to the Site Guidelines. 
It would also be important to take the approach of amending the existing guidelines rather than rewriting them. 
It was noted that it would not be desirable for the development of generic guidance to divert effort from making progress on adopting new site guidelines. It was also noted that a revision of Recommendation XVIII-1 would raise some policy and practical questions. Several participants recommended seeking the ATCM’s approval before initiating such a revision.
By contrast, adoption by means of a Resolution would bring “new” Guidelines into operation immediately.
3. What is the next step? 
Most of the participants agreed with the proposal of setting up an ICG to formally continue the present work. It was noted that the establishment of a standing group to asses new site guidelines and review proposed revisions to current site guidelines could be a good option. However, it was also suggested that the decision to continue this work through a standing group might best be taken after the CEP has considered how the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans has functioned.
Conclusions
The informal discussion convened by France during the last intersession period provided the following conclusions :
    • Some elements of the current Site Guidelines are not specific of the sites and should be considered as generic recommendations for all the sites in Antarctica,
    • A preliminary list of these generic elements has been produced. However, it was noted that generic and specific recommendations are not always mutually exclusive,
    • To avoid creating additional instruments relating to tourism management, and because participants saw merit in updating and improvement of the Recommendation XVIII-1, it is suggested that this new generic document could be based on the revision of the environmental elements of the guidelines attached to this Recommendation,
    • Whatever the tool used, it would be necessary to continue this work on a more formal way, establishing an Intersessional Contact Group or a standing group to consider the Site Guidelines.
Recommendation to CEP
	The CEP is invited to comment on the conclusions of this report and, if possible, to endorse some or all of them. 
If the CEP agrees with this approach, it would be necessary to establish an ICG to continue the work. The Term of References could be developed taking into account discussions at CEP XII.
