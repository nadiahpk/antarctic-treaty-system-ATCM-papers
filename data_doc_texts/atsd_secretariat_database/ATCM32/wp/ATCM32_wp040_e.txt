Review of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 136 Clark Peninsula and 162 Mawson’s Huts, and Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) 3 Cape Denison
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Abstract
Australia has conducted a five-yearly review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 162 Mawson’s Huts, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land and the Management Plan for Historic Site and Monument (HSM) No. 77 and Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 3, Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land, East Antarctica. Although not due for a five-yearly review, the Management Plan for ASPA 136 Clark Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land has also been reviewed to consider options to allow safe transit through an essential access corridor adjacent to the Area, in response to changing ice conditions. Australia recommends the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plans for these Areas. 
Introduction
In accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia has conducted the first five-yearly review of the Management Plans for:
    • ASPA 162 Mawson’s Huts, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land; and
    • HSM 77 and ASMA 3 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land, East Antarctica.
Australia has also conducted a review of the Management Plan for:
    • ASPA 136 Clark Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
The reviews were conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (1998). The following sections briefly describe the proposed amendments arising from the review of each Management Plan.
ASPA 162 Mawson’s Huts, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land
Mawson’s Huts are four timber huts that served as the winter base of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911–14 organised and led by geologist Dr (later Sir) Douglas Mawson. The huts are an important symbol of the ‘heroic age’ of Antarctic exploration. In recognition of the rarity and richness of this social, cultural and scientific resource, the Mawson’s Huts site was designated under Measure 2 (2004) as ASPA 162, to protect the important historical, technical, architectural and aesthetic value of the four Australasian Antarctic Expedition huts. The ASPA also contains part of the site designated under Measure 3 (2004) as Historic Site and Monument (HSM) No. 77 Cape Denison, and is embedded within ASMA 3 Cape Denison, designated under Measure 1 (2004). 
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 162
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • The access provisions in Section 8.1 are amended to clarify that authorised work parties may use vehicles within the ASPA for the purposes of transporting materials and equipment to and from the buildings.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 10 is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    • Minor editorial amendments have been made throughout.
HSM 77 and ASMA 3 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land
Cape Denison is one of the principal sites of early human activity in Antarctica. It is the location of the base of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911-14 organised and led by Dr (later Sir) Douglas Mawson. Cape Denison is characterised by four valleys aligned northwest/southeast. The majority of Australasian Antarctic Expedition artefacts, including buildings (‘Mawson’s Huts’) and other structures, are concentrated in the westernmost valley and on the ridges on either side of the valley. Cape Denison hosted some of the earliest comprehensive studies of Antarctic geology, geography, terrestrial magnetism, astronomy, meteorology, glaciology, oceanography, biology, zoology and botany. It was also the base of numerous explorations inland and features artefacts associated with these sledging parties, including food caches and equipment. Due to its considerable historical, cultural and scientific significance, Cape Denison was designated under Measure 1 (2004) as ASMA No. 3 and listed under Measure 3 (2004) as HSM No. 77. The four Australasian Antarctic Expedition historic huts and their immediate surrounds were designated under Measure 2 (2004) as ASPA 162 Mawson’s Huts.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASMA 3
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • The description in Section 5.3 of structures and objects in the Area is updated to reflect the current situation.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 10 is updated with several relevant recent publications.
    • Minor editorial amendments have been made throughout.
ASPA 136 Clark Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
Clark Peninsula was originally designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 17 under Recommendation 8 (1985). Revised Management Plans were adopted under Measure 1 (2000) and under Measure 1 (2006). The Area is approximately 9.4 km2 in area and is adjacent to the Windmill Islands on the Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. Scientific research within the Area has focused on plant communities and long term population studies of Adélie penguin colonies. The protection of this flora and fauna within the Area allows for valuable comparison with similar plant communities and penguin colonies closer to Casey station (approximately 5 km to the south-west), which are subject to greater levels of human disturbance. 
Australia has conducted a review of the Management Plan to consider safety and environmental implications of changed ice conditions along an essential access corridor adjacent to the Area boundary.  The corridor between the southern boundary of the Area and the coast is frequently used for overland transport between Casey station and the abandoned Wilkes station site. Ice cliffs adjacent to the Noonan Cove area have retreated and melt streams and crevasses exposed during the summer melt make this portion of the current route dangerous. The topography of the area means that alternative overland routes outside the Area are not possible. The review involved consultations with the main researchers and operational support personnel working in the Area and on-site management visits in December 2008 and February 2009.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 136
    • A portion of the southern boundary of the Area has been realigned, and text and maps amended accordingly, to allow a safe alternative to the current access route between Casey station and the abandoned Wilkes station site. The new route traverses only ice and snow covered ground through an area that does not support fauna or flora, and will not impact on the values of the Area. 
    • There are no other major changes to the Area description or management measures.
Recommendation
Australia recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plans for:
    • ASPA 162 Mawson’s Huts, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land (Attachment A);
    • HSM 77 and ASMA 3 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land (Attachment B); and
    • ASPA 136 Clark Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land (Attachment C).
