Site Guidelines for Baily Head and Telefon Bay, 
Deception Island, South Shetland Islands


Working Paper submitted by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, with the assistance of IAATO and ASOC


Summary
1. Baily Head on Deception Island is the site of Antarctica’s largest chinstrap penguin colony. Telefon Bay contains exemplary volcanic craters. Both are frequently visited by tourist vessels. 
2.  Following the adoption of Site Guidelines, by Resolution 5(2005), Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States have prepared Site Guidelines for Baily Head with the close assistance of IAATO and ASOC, and recommends that the CEP submit these for adoption by the ATCM.
Background
3. Baily Head (62º58’S, 60º30’W) is located on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. It is a rocky headland exposed to the Bransfield Strait on the south east coast of Deception Island. The site comprises the southern end of a long linear beach which runs along most of the eastern side of Deception Island, and a narrow valley that rises steeply inland to a semi-circular ridgeline, giving the impression of a natural ‘amphitheatre’. 
4. Telefon Bay (62º56’S, 60º40’W) is located at the northern end of Port Foster. A gently sloping beach leads to a broad shallow valley which rises sharply to a number of unnamed volcanic craters, up to 45m in depth.
5. Visits to Baily Head have increased from 5 visits (455 visitors landed) in 1989/90 to 17 visits (1386 visitors landed) in 2007/08. The greatest level of visitation was 2005-06, with 48 landings and 3650 visitors. 
6. Visits to Telefon Bay have increased from 6 visits (492 visitors landed) in 1989/90 to 47 visits (3068 visitors landed) in 2007/08. The greatest level of visitation was 2006-07, with 48 landings and 3252 visitors.
7. Deception Island was adopted as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXVIII (Stockholm, 2005). The ASMA incorporates the Baily Head site and the management plan includes a Code of Conduct for visitors to the site. 
8. The attached site guidelines for Baily Head and Telefon Bay build upon the management provisions previously adopted in the ASMA management plan, in a format consistent with other ATCM Site Guidelines.
