A Work Program for CEP Action on Non-native Species







A Work Program for CEP Action on Non-native Species
Working Paper submitted by Australia, France and New Zealand
Abstract
Addressing non-native species concerns is the highest priority issue in the CEP five-year work plan. In accordance with actions identified in the work plan, this paper reviews the recommendations arising from the 2006 workshop on Non-native species in the Antarctic and suggests a schedule of further actions as part of a detailed work program for this issue. Also included are proposed Terms of Reference for intersessional work to commence developing a manual of quarantine measures.
Background
Non-native species (sometimes called alien species) are species that have been introduced to an ecosystem either intentionally or unintentionally. Introduction means the movement, as a direct or indirect result of human activity, of species into an area where they are not native. This includes the introduction to the Antarctic region of species not native to that region, and also the movement of species within Antarctica to a biogeographic zone where such species are not naturally present. 
Article 4 of Annex II to the Protocol:
    • prohibits the introduction of non-native species except in accordance with a permit;
    • places restrictions on what can be permitted;
    • provides an exemption for food;
    • requires that permitted species must be removed or destroyed; and
    • requires precautions to be taken to prevent the introduction of microorganisms not present in the native fauna and flora.
These provisions are largely aimed at intentional introductions of non-native species. The need for Parties to address the issue of unintentional introductions, including the movement of species between sites within Antarctica, is not explicitly stated in the Protocol, though it can be inferred from a number of Articles (e.g. Article 3(2)(b)(iv)). The CEP has discussed issues relating to non-native species since its first meeting in 1998, as outlined in the topic summary prepared by the Secretariat at the Committee’s request (see SP11 Topic Summary of CEP discussions on Non-native species (NNS) in Antarctica).
When discussing the recommendations of the April 2006 workshop on Non-native Species in the Antarctic (ATCM XXIX / WP13) the Committee agreed ‘the issue of non-native species should be given the highest priority consistent with the high environmental standards set out in the Protocol’ (CEP IX Final Report, para. 129). It also agreed the CEP should take the lead on this issue, and strongly supported several recommendations regarding future priority actions. These agreements were reflected in the five-year work plan adopted at CEP XI (Final Report, Appendix 1), which rated ‘Introduction of non-native species’ as a priority 1 issue and identified four actions:
    1) Review workshop recommendations (i.e. 2006 workshop on Non-native Species in the Antarctic)
    2) Develop practical guidelines / standards / norms for all Antarctic operators
    3) Establish a database of non-native species occurrences in Antarctica1
    4) Review / endorse SCAR’s (RiSCC) guidelines2


A work program to address the introduction of non-native species (including the transfer of species between sites in Antarctica)
In response to the actions outlined above Australia, France and New Zealand have reviewed the six main recommendations3 arising from the 2006 workshop on Non-native species in the Antarctic and have identified suggested actions to further develop a comprehensive work plan to address the introduction of non-native species, including the transfer of species between sites in Antarctica.
Workshop Recommendation 1.  The issue of non-native species in the Antarctic should be given the highest priority consistent with the high environmental standards set out in the Protocol; a ‘zero tolerance’ approach.
As indicated above the CEP has agreed with this recommendation, and has identified ‘Introduction of non-native species’ as a top priority in its five-year work plan. However, it would provide greater focus and context for future actions if the Parties agreed on an overall objective and key guiding principles. Such high-level statements could also be drawn on in educational material developed for operators and visitors.
Suggested action: The CEP should at this meeting initiate intersessional work to develop a suggested overall objective and key guiding principles for the Parties’ efforts to address the introduction of non-native species, including the transfer of species between sites in Antarctica.
Workshop Recommendation 2.  The CEP should take the lead on the issue and give consideration to placing the issue of non-native species as a separate item on its meeting agenda.
The CEP has agreed it should take the lead on this issue, and has included ‘Quarantine and non-native species’ as a separate item on its agenda. Australia, New Zealand and France suggest it is now important that the CEP acts in a timely and structured manner to develop advice to the Parties on this issue, by agreeing and implementing a detailed program of work that closely reflects the advice of the 2006 workshop on Non-native Species in the Antarctic about the principal components of any management program:
    • Prevention: the most effective means of minimizing the impacts of non-native species is to prevent their introduction in the first place. Requires comprehensive controls and procedures to be in place.
    • Surveillance: can be passive (i.e. waiting for things to appear in the native environment) or targeted (i.e. an active programme of identifying potential non-native species). Requires good baseline data about what is already present in the native fauna and flora.
    • Response: can include eradication or control. The key factor will be to respond quickly and assess the feasibility, affordability and desirability of eradicating the non-native species. If eradication is not an option then control / confinement needs to be considered.
A suggested work program, incorporating the tasks identified throughout this Working Paper, is given in Attachment A. The suggested work program prioritises the development of advice and measures for ‘Prevention’, acknowledged as the most effective means of minimising any impact, but also incorporates initial steps to address requirements for ‘Surveillance’ and ‘Response’. The work program should be reviewed annually and subsequent actions agreed and implemented as appropriate.
Suggested action: The CEP should at this meeting adopt and then annually review a program of actions to address non-native species concerns, based on a ‘Prevention / Surveillance / Response’ approach.
Workshop Recommendation 3.  The CEP should give consideration to sharing information with, seeking advice from, and coordinating action among other bodies, notably SCAR, CCAMLR, COMNAP, IAATO, IUCN and other organizations as appropriate (e.g. IMO).
In accordance with Article 12.2 of the Protocol, the CEP should consult with relevant experts and organisations when developing advice to the Parties on the introduction of non-native species. Opportunities for cooperation and collaboration between the CEP and Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (SC-CAMLR) on the issue of non-native species in the Antarctic marine environment will be discussed at the joint meeting immediately prior to CEP XII.
Suggested action: The Committee should ensure that interactions with other relevant organisations and experts are reinforced or developed through the proposed work program.
Workshop Recommendation 4.  Dedicated research is required to improve our understanding of, inter alia, existing biological and genetic diversity, species distributions, and biogeographic zones; the potential implications of a warming climate, and identification of high risk areas and ecosystems.  Particular research attention needs to be given to microbial communities and marine ecosystems.
The Committee has noted that the IPY Aliens in Antarctica project aims to assess the pathways of propagule transfer to Antarctica. As mentioned above, the CEP / SC-CAMLR workshop will consider matters relating to marine non-native species. The marine bioregionalisation developed by SC-CAMLR and CEP (ATCM XXXI / IP2), and the Environmental Domains Analysis of the Antarctic continent adopted in Resolution 3 (2008) together provide a valuable environmental-geographic framework within which to consider non-native species matters.
Suggested action: Members should prepare for a dedicated discussion at CEP XIII of research and monitoring needs, to coincide with consideration of the results of the IPY Aliens in Antarctica project. That meeting should commission further advice from experts and other organisations as appropriate on high risk environments / areas / species / activities and requirements for further research and monitoring, and response measures.
Workshop Recommendation 5.  To the extent possible, non-native species concerns should be built into existing procedures and practices; notably EIA procedures and the protected areas system.
Non-native species concerns could be considered in discussions currently underway on the possible need to revise the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas – Resolution 2 (1998), and the environmental components of the Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic and Guidance for those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic – Recommendation XVIII-1. 
Other opportunities might include future reviews of other guiding documents, including the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica, the Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol – Resolution 1 (2000) individual Site Guidelines, the Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Antarctica – Resolution 2 (2005), and the Practical Guidelines for Ballast Water Exchange in the Antarctic Treaty Area – Resolution 3 (2006).
Suggested action: The Committee should request groups reviewing relevant guidelines to consider non-native species concerns. Members should also consider non-native species concerns when conducting EIAs, and preparing management plans, site guidelines and similar.
Workshop Recommendation 6.  A set of comprehensive and standardised guidance and / or procedures should be developed, aimed at all operators in the Antarctic, based on a ‘Prevention, Surveillance, Response’ approach.
This action is identified in general terms as Action #2 in the CEP five-year work plan. It is likely some measures would be broadly applicable to a wide range of activities and could form the basis of generally applicable guidelines. However, it is also likely that particular aspects of Antarctic activities will require the development of specific guidance (e.g. intercontinental air transport might require specific measures due to the short travel time and related constraints on implementing in-transit quarantine measures, such as ship-based boot washing). One option would be to commence development of a quarantine ‘manual’, including statements about the overall objective and key guiding principles (see comments against Recommendation 1 above), plus a section on generally applicable guidelines. Additional sections containing specific guidance for particular aspects of Antarctic operations could be developed and added over time as required. The need for such additional guidance might also be informed by advice received in response to actions identified against Recommendations 4 above.
Suggested action: The CEP should at this meeting initiate intersessional work to – initially – develop a suggested set of generally applicable practical measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species, including the transfer of species between sites in Antarctica. Further consideration should be given to the need for specific guidance for particular aspects of Antarctic operations, and this might be informed by further research and expert advice on risks.
Recommendations
