Annex II: Finalising the Review
Working Paper submitted by Australia

Abstract
This paper builds on the constructive discussions at the 31st Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXXI, 2008) about the review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. As agreed at ATCM XXXI, this paper provides Australia’s further suggestions for addressing outstanding matters.
Introduction
Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty has been under review by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) and then the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) since 2001. Appendix A to this Working Paper summarises deliberations on this matter at earlier meetings.
At ATCM XXXI the Parties considered two papers by Australia on the Review of Annex II: WP18 Annex II: Proposals for Completing the Review; and IP18 Review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection. The Legal and Institutional Working Group first considered the Working Paper, which proposed the adoption of specific amendments to the Annex. Following discussion of this paper there was general acknowledgement – though no decisions were formally taken – that it would be appropriate to modify the Annex to: include invertebrates in relevant provisions; include references to criteria and procedures for designating and managing Specially Protected Species; enhance provisions to prevent the unintentional or accidental introduction of non-native species and disease; and to make other technical and grammatical amendments as appropriate.
The Working Group then discussed IP18, which provided background to the CEP’s recommendations on the review of Annex II, summarised subsequent discussions by the ATCM, and gave Australia’s suggestions for addressing the proposed amendments. With that paper as the basis for discussion, the Working Group proceeded through a clause-by-clause discussion of proposed amendments to the Annex. There was broad agreement to a range of amendments which were generally supported by the Working Group, although it was clearly understood that no changes had been formally agreed. On a small number of issues discussions of possible alternate texts had been raised but not resolved.
The Working Group Chair circulated to all delegations a document that represented, in his view, a working text of Annex II representing the status of discussions as at the close of the meeting. Australia agreed to present an updated Working Paper for further consideration at ATCM XXXII.
Proposed amendments
Appendix B to this Working Paper presents Australia’s comments and suggestions on the working text circulated by the Working Group Chair at the conclusion of discussions at ATCM XXXI. The first column contains the Working Group Chair’s summary, which shows changes from the original version of the Annex in Track Changes mode. The first column also contains some additional amendments which represent Australia’s proposals for consideration by the meeting. These proposals are explained in the second column.
Recommendation
Australia recommends that the ATCM adopt the proposed amendments outlined in Appendix B, with a view to finalising the review of Annex II at this meeting.

Appendix A. Summary of ATCM and CEP discussions on the review of Annex II
2001: CEP IV / ATCM XXIV
    • The CEP agreed to start a rolling review of the Annexes to the Protocol and, noting issues raised in ongoing intersessional consideration of Specially Protected Species, decided to commence with a review of Annex II (see CEP IV Final Report para 6).
    • The ATCM endorsed the CEP’s proposal, recognising that “amendment of the annexes, to reflect changing environmental conditions and practices, had been inherent in the original design of the Protocol as a framework document with attached Annexes” (see ATCM XXIV Final Report para 41).
2002: CEP V / ATCM XXV
    • Two Working Papers were submitted to CEP V on the review of Annex II (WP7 Annex II: Reasons for a Review, Argentina; and WP37 Comments on the Revision of Annex II, SCAR).
    • The CEP established an intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) convened by Argentina to advance the review of Annex II (see CEP V Final Report paras 51-55).
    • ATCM XXV welcomed the commencement of the CEP’s review process (see ATCM XXV Final Report para 67).
2003: CEP VI / ATCM XXVI
    • Argentina presented to CEP VI WP25 Progress Report of the CEP Intersessional Contact Group on Annex II, reporting on the first round of ICG discussions.
    • The CEP considered several issues raised in the report and agreed the ICG should continue its work and provide a final report to CEP VII (See CEP VI Final Report paras 63-105).
    • The ATCM noted the work of the ICG and CEP to date. It discussed a question from the CEP about whether a change to the title of Annex II (to “Conservation of Antarctic Living Organisms”) would be permissible but did not reach consensus on the matter, which the Chair urged parties to consider for discussion at ATCM XXVIII (see ATCM XXVI Final Report paras 68 & 69).
2004: CEP VII / ATCM XXVII
    • The CEP considered two Working Papers prepared following the second round of intersessional discussions on the review of Annex II: WP17 Final Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Annex II Review (Argentina) and WP22 Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (United Kingdom). Each paper presented a suggested revised version of the Annex.
    • The CEP was unable to reach consensus on all areas of difference between the two versions, and referred to the ATCM for consideration a version with square bracketed alternatives where consensus agreement could not be reached. This version was included as Appendix 9 to the CEP VII Final Report (see CEP VII Final Report paras 88-100).
    • The ATCM noted the CEP’s review had resolved a number of technical matters but that some policy matters of a more substantial nature remained to be addressed, including: whether the title of the Annex should be amended and, if so, whether its scope would be extended; if the definitions in Article 1 should be modified; and whether to extend the designation of Specially Protected Species to include marine species. The Meeting agreed to refer the topic for further consideration at ATCM XXVIII (see ATCM XXVII Final Report paras 81-85).
CEP VIII / ATCM XXVIII (2005)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP VIII.
    • The ATCM only briefly discussed the review of Annex II and agreed to revisit the matter at ATCM XXIX (see ATCM XXVIII Final Report para 81).
CEP IX / ATCM XXIX (2006)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP IX.
    • The CEP Chair presented a non-paper (a re-formatted version of Appendix 9 to the CEP VII Final Report) and participated in the Legal and Institutional Working Group’s discussions of Annex II. The outcomes of discussions by the Legal and Institutional Working Group were reflected in a Working Paper produced during the meeting by the United Kingdom, WP 44 Review of Annex II of the Environmental Protocol. That paper provided a draft revised text of Annex II, based on Appendix 9 to the ATCM XXVII Final Report, amended to delete proposed references to the term “Antarctic Living Organisms”.
    • Some delegations felt that the advice from the CEP was insufficient to enable the Meeting to arrive at a conclusion and that further technical and scientific work was needed. Other delegations noted that the advice of the CEP, though comprehensive, did not reflect a consensus. The Meeting noted, however, that the advice of the CEP need not be consensual. Some delegations did not believe that Annex II should be remitted back to the CEP. It was decided that this issue would need to be discussed at ATCM XXX (see ATCM XXIX Final Report paras 43-45).
CEP X / ATCM XXX (2007)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP X.
    • The ATCM considered three papers on the review of Annex II: WP19 On Review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (Russian Federation); IP137 Re-Issue of WP44 (ATCM XXIX) Review of Annex II of the Environmental Protocol (United Kingdom); and IP81 Amendment or Modification of Annex II and the Implications for Further Annex Review (ASOC).      
    • There was considerable discussion in a contact group of the Legal and Institutional Working Group, which worked through the CEP’s proposed amendments article by article up to Article 4.3, but this did not result in agreement on any matters by the Working Group or the Meeting.
    • Views expressed during discussion of the matter included that:
    • the review of Annex II had continued for a long period and the review should be completed at the present meeting;
    • some technical aspects of Annex II could be improved, but negotiation and entry into force of revisions could take a long time and the benefit might be limited compared to other possible avenues of protection;
    • further scientific background to the review was desirable; further scientific input was not needed and that what was required was a legal and policy perspective; and
    • explanations of proposed amendments to Annex II would be desirable. 
    • The Meeting agreed to return to the issue of Annex II at ATCM XXXI (see ATCM XXX Final Report paras 39-43).
CEP XI / ATCM XXXI (2008)
    • Having provided advice to ATCM XXVII, the CEP did not consider the review of Annex II at CEP X.
    • The ATCM considered two papers by Australia on the review of Annex II: WP18 Annex II: Proposals for Completing the Review; and IP18 Review of Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection. Australia noted that these papers were a response to discussion at ATCM XXX, and proposed specific amendments to the Annex, taking into account the advice of the CEP.
    • Several Parties supported continuing this process, while others underscored that agreement to discuss the proposed changes did not mean agreement to make amendments, as the judgement as to whether amending the Annex is indispensable would have to await the complete final text. The Meeting considered the specific changes proposed to Annex II based on IP 18 with the understanding “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”.
    • The Chairman of the Legal and Institutional Working Group circulated his personal summary of 10 June 2008 to all delegations. This was translated into the four official languages.
    • Australia agreed to present a Working Paper on Annex II, including the specific proposed amendments to Annex II, for further discussion at ATCM XXXII.
