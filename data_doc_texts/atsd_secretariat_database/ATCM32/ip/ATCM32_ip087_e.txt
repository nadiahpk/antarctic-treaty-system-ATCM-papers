IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM)

An Information Paper Submitted by the 
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)


Summary
IAATO views training and experience as lynchpins of its mission: safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to Antarctica. An example of the industry’s efforts to continually elevate standards in this regard is the creation of the IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM). The FOM – an 800-page, two-volume compendium – is based on the traditional expedition leader’s handbook previously created by each Member-operator for its own vessel or operation. The new standardized format, introduced for the 2008-2009 season and used by all IAATO members, incorporates numerous guidelines and operating procedures that have proven to be effective tools over the years for the management of Antarctic travel. The FOM also provides the course material for the IAATO online training and assessment initiative for field staff.

IAATO views good training and experience as key factors in ensuring best practice in safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to Antarctica. Continual efforts in this regard remain a driving factor in IAATO’s annual goals and project development. The creation of a Field Operations Manual, as part of a wider field staff training and assessment initiative, is an example of these efforts. 
Member-operators have individually developed and maintained detailed expedition leader’s handbooks for use in the field since the founding of IAATO in 1991. These originally were based on an annual checklist of documents created by the organization. IAATO took this a further step for the 2008-2009 Antarctic season and created an actual manual: the IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM). 
The rationale behind creating a standard document was to ensure that a consistent, well-recognized format is used throughout the field for transmitting the latest information, regulations and guidelines. Standardizing the traditional expedition leader’s handbook in this manner eases communications between the IAATO Secretariat, the Members’ home offices and the field. It also facilitates communication within the field and for those field staff who work for multiple operators.
The Manual assists in maintaining compliance with IAATO Bylaws. Finally, the FOM will serve as the “course manual” for the IAATO online Field Staff Assessment that all expedition leaders and, eventually, all field staff will be required to complete. 
How the FOM works: 
Due to the dynamic nature of field operations, the FOM is a combination of hard copy and electronic files. At the beginning of each Antarctic operating cycle, Seasonal Instructions and updated versions of hard copies will be sent to each Member-operator (one copy for the Member’s home office plus one for each vessel/field operation as needed). In addition, electronic updates will be sent to the operators throughout the season to forward on to their vessels/field operations. Once received, these electronic updates are then printed and added to the Manual.
In addition to the hard copy and electronic updates, an annually updated CD is included with each FOM, including all the files, plus additional non-printed background material. Finally, a regularly updated online version of the FOM is contained in the Members-Only section of the IAATO website (www.iaato.org). The Table of Contents, provided in Appendix 1, details which files are available only on the CD or electronically.
Simply stated, the goal of the Field Operations Manual is to ensure that all Members and their field staff know what is required, and where to find critical information and the additional resources available to them.
