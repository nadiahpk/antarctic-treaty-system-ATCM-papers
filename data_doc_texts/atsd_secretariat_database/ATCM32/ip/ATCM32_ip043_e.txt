Results of Russian activities in the deep ice borehole at Vostok station in implementing the project of penetration to the water layer of the subglacial lake in the season of 2008/2009
The problem of investigating the Antarctic subglacial Lake Vostok remains in the focus of attention of current Russian Antarctic studies. A new step in the development of this scientific project is inseparably connected with the implementation of environmentally-friendly technology developed in 2001 by the Russian engineers and scientists for penetrating the water strata of this subglacial lake for collection of samples from its surface layer. As is known, it was proposed to penetrate the lake by continuing drilling operations in a deep ice borehole 5G-1. Drilling operations were interrupted due a technical failure in the borehole on 23 November 2007, as a result of which a drill 13 m long was left in the lower part of the borehole. For the time of the accident, the depth of the borehole 5G-1 was 3666.54 m. The cause of the accident and measures undertaken to eliminate its consequences in the summer Antarctic season 2007-2008 were described by the Russian Delegation in the IP 44 at ATCM XXXI. The main part of the drill is located in a cavern formed as a result of using antifreeze in January 2007 when eliminating the accident. So, the position of the drill allowed us to hope for its successful recovery to the surface. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the drilling fluid level and density by the drillers at Vostok station. This has resulted in intensive narrowing of the borehole above the drill, which is indicated by data of caliper logging, conducted on 10 December 2007.
The objectives of the drilling team operation at Vostok station in the summer season of 2008-09 were formulated practically as early as January 2008 when completing technological operations in the borehole 5G-1. During the preparation period after the return of the drilling team from Vostok station to St. Petersburg in February 2008 these objectives were additionally analyzed and specified. A required additional set of equipment and technological gadgets was prepared for attempting extraction of the damaged drill. Before the start of this work in the Antarctic summer of 2008-2009, the necessary volumes of Freon F-141b, antifreeze and aviation kerosene of JET type were delivered to Vostok station by the method of air dropping. The drilling work program in the season of 2008-09 included:
    • caliper logging observations above the borehole part where the accident took place;
    • assembling and test operation of the new drill;
    • expansion of the narrowed part of the borehole;
    • delivery of antifreeze to the stuck drill for its recovery;
    • extraction of the drill;
    • raising the water solution of antifreeze from the borehole;
    • continuation of core drilling.
The work program envisaged implementation of the second variant of the development of events, if the attempt to extract the damaged drill from the borehole fails. In this case, it was planned to deflect the borehole above the accident area in order to avoid it and continue core drilling. It was planned simultaneously to carry out a large volume of glaciological investigations using the archived collection of ice cores stored at Vostok station.
The work of the drilling team began on 9 December 2008 and continued until 2 February 2009. The total working period was 56 days. The team was comprised of 8 people and the Head of the team was Professor Nikolay Vasiliev, Holder of Chair of the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. On 14 December, after finishing reactivation of the drilling complex at Vostok station, caliper logging measurements (vertical profile of the borehole diameter) were made in the interval of 2200-2621 m. The obtained results indicated absence of deformations of the borehole sides for the last year and the same depth level of the drilling fluid. Simultaneously, assembling and adjustment of the new drill was performed using units and components that were left at the station and that were delivered from St. Petersburg. On 23 December, the drilling team began drilling the borehole part with a reduced diameter. Expansion of the borehole was made in four stages by bore bits with diameters of 133, 135, 137 and 138.1 mm. In the course of this work, about 850 liters of ice from the sides of the borehole was extracted to the surface.
The work to extract the stuck drill was carried out on 14-16 January. Diluted antifreeze (450 liters) in proportion of 300 liters of antifreeze to 150 liters of water was delivered to the borehole area above the damaged drill. Water was added to prevent freezing of the drilling fluid when passing through the upper cold horizons of the borehole. The position of the damaged drill and the level of antifreeze poured to the borehole above it were under control. According to available data, the damaged drill was 5 m above the bottom and therefore it was decided to begin extraction of the drill after the antifreeze flows through the borehole to beneath the drill and the drill itself sinks by 5 m to the borehole bottom. Until 25 January, in spite of the fact that the antifreeze level has significantly decreased, the drill itself remained motionless, so it was decided to stop efforts to extract the drill and begin drilling a new borehole deflecting it from the main borehole 5G-1. This was mainly due to a very restricted time left until the end of the planned seasonal work at Vostok station. 
The new borehole with deflection from the main borehole was drilled using a new technology developed at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. The deflection was started from a depth of 3589 m. This was connected with a wish of glaciologists, geochemists and microbiologists to have a new core material from the depth interval of 3600-3620 m, where according to data of borehole 5G-1 large number of mineral inclusions and DNA of thermophilic bacteria were noted. The new borehole was called borehole 5G-2. Calculation of the deflection angle of this borehole from the main borehole 5G-1 showed that its value of 1o made it possible to have a difference at a depth of 3600 m in the position of two boreholes of about 780 mm. At the maximum possible diameter of the cavern of about 950 mm (a radius of 475 mm), which can form on the ice at the impact of clean antifreeze in the depth interval of the accident, the guaranteed distance between the sides of the old and new boreholes will be not less than 230 mm. During the round trip operations after delivering antifreeze to the borehole, some part of it spread along the borehole to a height up to 300 m. A crust of the frozen water solution of antifreeze up to 5 mm thick was detected on the surface of the crescent-shaped ice core retrieved in the course of drilling for deflecting the borehole. The obtained data indicate that the real volume of antifreeze in the place of the accident is slightly less than the calculated one and the cavern that could form in this part of the borehole will obviously be less than the calculated one. In the course of drilling operations for deflecting the borehole, 3.5 m of new ice core was obtained suitable for comprehensive analyses in the depth interval of 3595.1 – 3598.6 m. Two small mineral inclusions were found. The drilling complex was temporarily abandoned. Drilling in the borehole 5G-2 should be resumed in December 2009. By organizing 24 h work a day of drillers it is planned to reach the limits of the borehole 5G-1 bottom or even lower horizons.
Glaciological studies at Vostok station in the season of 2008-2009 were devoted to a petrographic investigation of the ice core specimens of water origin from the archived station collection. Special attention was given to investigating the boundary between ice of the atmospheric origin and ice formed of frozen lake water (a layer of 3536-3539 m). As is known from data of isotopic analysis, it was earlier determined that such boundary was at a depth of 3538.6 m. The petrographic studies showed that by the number and size of the air bubbles (gaseous content of ice) the boundary between two different in origin ice strata was at a depth of 3536.9 m, which is 1.7 m as high as the depth of its established position. In order to check this and the consistency of data obtained from independent sources, sampling of 5-cm specimens for isotopic studies in the depth interval of 3536-3539 m was repeated.
The preliminary analysis of obtained data showed that in spite of our earlier understanding, lake ice of type I (formed in shallow water areas of the lake with inclusion of mineral material in the interval of 3538-3609 m), is in fact rather non-uniform. This conclusion is based on the quantitative analysis of the vertical distribution of mineral inclusions and concentration of frozen “water pockets”. In particular in the interval of 3606-3608 m, a layer with abundance of large in size mineral inclusions is distinguished. The largest mineral inclusion (about 1.5 cm in diameter) was found in the borehole 5G-1 at a depth of 3608 m. In the course of preliminary studies of the new core of lake ice, obtained in the depth interval of 3595.1-3598.6 m of borehole 5Г-2, inclusions of sedimentary rocks of the lake 1-2 mm in size were discovered.
The Russian Antarctic expedition has completed preparation of the final CEE of the project of environmentally clean penetration to the water layer of Lake Vostok with water sampling through the existing deep ice borehole at Vostok station, giving answers to all comments received. However, we were obliged to make a decision to avoid the place of the accident in the borehole 5G-1 using a new borehole deflected from the previous one and that is why we are unable to present this document at ATCM XXXII. This is connected not only with the need for describing a new vertical profile of the borehole but also with acquisition of new data on the structure of the ice cores and the content of geochemical and microbiological material they contain. New data will allow us to confirm the earlier results or will pose new questions to investigators. Therefore, we have to state that direct penetration to the water layer of Lake Vostok is postponed to the nearest perspective and could not be fulfilled during the period of IPY activities.
