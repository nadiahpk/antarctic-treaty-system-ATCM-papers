IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2008-2009 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2009-2010 Antarctic Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)

Introduction
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide a brief initial overview of Antarctic tourism for the 2008-2009 season, and estimates for the 2009-2010 season.
Because of the early timing of ATCM XXXII, it has not been possible to compile or analyze in detail the statistical data for the 2008-2009 season. It is expected that this information will be available in June 2009, and will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under Information Papers.

It is, however, possible to give an estimated general picture of the 2008-2009 Antarctic tourism season on the basis of preliminary information only. For comparison purposes, the total number of visitors for the 2007-2008 season, including those partaking in over-flights and cruise-only voyages, was reported by IAATO to be 46,265 (ATCM XXXI IP 85 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2007-2008 Antarctic Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2008-2009 Antarctic Season). This number is expected to drop sixteen percent to approximately 38,900 including over-flights and cruise-only visitors (counting IAATO Member passengers only) for the 2008-2009 season. It is worthwhile noting that this number is eight percent below the 42,298 that IAATO members had projected in June 2008 for the 2008-2009 season. 

Detailed estimates for the 2009-2010 season can be found in Appendix B of this paper. Overall, these estimates indicate a total of 42,964 visitors. In light of the current economic climate, these estimates could be considered optimistic.

1.0	Overview
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As during the past 18 seasons, IAATO membership continues to incorporate the majority of all known Antarctic tour operators. All IAATO operators have submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National Authority.
1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourist activities included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, running events, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for a minimum of nine years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. 
Appendices to this information paper provide further details of scope of the IAATO-member activities, including vessels/aircraft, departures, passenger numbers and activities. The Appendices are as follows:
    • Appendix A: Histogram of 1992-2009 Antarctic Tourist Trends – Landed Passengers, including ship- and land-based passenger numbers;
    • Appendix B: Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism 2009-2010.

	** Includes Member and non-member yachts (sailing and motor) where the information was available.  

The vast majority of commercially-operated voyages operate in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the six-month austral summer season (from mid-October to early April), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser extent, from other ports north of the Treaty areas. 
2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2009-2010 Season
Appendix B illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2009-2010 season. The estimate is based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat at the time this report was submitted. 
For the 2009-2010 season, ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of small auxiliary boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B, Naiad, etc.), shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA, diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, helicopter operations and use of an underwater ROV.
2.1 IAATO Member Activity
According to estimates provided to IAATO by members, 25,258 seaborne and yacht (sailing and motor) passengers are expected to land in Antarctica from commercially-organized vessels, 450 from combination air-cruise programs, and 225 on air or land-based expeditions during the 2009-2010 season. Another 16,631 are anticipated on cruise-only programs and 400 on over-flights (see Appendix B).

3.0 Antarctic Tourism Trends

A trends chart showing the change in tourism dating from the 1992-1993 season, with estimate for both the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons, can be found in Appendix A of this paper.  

The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (http://www.iaato.org) under the category of Tourism Statistics: 

    • Tourists by Nationality (Landed)
    • Tourists by Nationality (Air and Cruise)
    • Tourists by Nationality (All)
    • Tourist Nationalities by Vessel
    • Trends 1992-2007
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per site per vessel-All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per Site per Vessel-Continental Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-All Antarctic Sites
    • Number of Tourists per Site per Vessel
    • Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-Peninsula Sites 
    • Number of Visits per Site per Activity.

These datasheets will be posted once the statistics have been finalized in June 2009.
	
4.0 Conclusion
In practice, and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether Members of IAATO or not – will be included in the exchange of emergency contact information, coordination of landing activities and in the subsequent reporting of tourist-related statistics. IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent by means of complete reporting, since effective tourism management by Treaty Parties and IAATO is based on a robust database.
IAATO remains committed to effectively managing Antarctic tourism and, as an organization, is focused on minimizing environmental impacts and consequently evaluates all relevant tourist activities. On the basis of that evaluation, IAATO believes that member activities continue to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
