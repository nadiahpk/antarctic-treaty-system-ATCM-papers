Brief Introduction on the Third Chinese National Arctic 
Marine Survey - IPY China Programme
Summary
The Third Chinese National Arctic Marine Survey is an important part of the IPY China Programme. After the first and the second surveys happened respectively in the year of 1999 and 2003, the third survey was carried out by R/V Xuelong during July 11th to September 25th of 2008, which took 76 days and sailed 12,000 nautical miles on marine scientific research.
1. Team composition
110 domestic participants from the scientific research institutions and universities under Chinese Academy of Sciences, Department of Education and the Chinese Meteorological Administration as well as the State Oceanic Administration took part in the program. Meanwhile, 12 foreign scientists from France, Finland under the IPY-DAMOCLES Project and from the United States, Japan and Korea under PAG also participated in the program. In total, 122 people were involved in the program.
2. Survey area
The surveying team had carried out field marine investigation at 132 sites, a long-term combined sea-ice-atmospheric observation and short-term sea ice investigation at 8 sites in respectively in Baring Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Chukchi Platform as well as Canadian Basin.

3. The scientific objectives 
The scientific objectives of the program are as follows:
    • Study on the impacts of the variations of the Arctic climate on China's climate;
    • Study on the Changes of the Arctic marine environment and its ecological and climate effects;
    • Study on the evolution history of the paleo-ocean in the late quaternary and the regional and the global impacts caused by the some key geological events of Arctic marine area;
    • Study on the deep-sea microbial resources and the diversity of genetic resources in Arctic and adjacent sea; to explore the relationship between biodiversity changes with the marine environmental change based on the combination of geological evolution.
4. The scientific projects
The investigation related to physical oceanography, marine chemical, marine biology, marine geology, sea-ice observation, atmospheric observations and underwater gliders, underwater robot and various sub-merged buoys and ice buoys automatic observation. The major research projects were:
    • Study on the boundary current circulating the Arctic and the change process of the Arctic dynamic environment;
    • Study on the bio-geochemical circulation of carbon and ecological factors in the Arctic Ocean;
    • Biodiversity study of deep sea organisms in the Arctic Ocean;
    • The structure and variation of the Arctic ecosystem;
    • Study on the evolution history of paleo-ocean of the Arctic in the late quaternary;
    • Study on mercury, trace gases and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in atmosphere, ice and snow and ocean boundary of polar area;
    • Study on the changes of interface coupling of the Arctic sea, ice and atmosphere with the Arctic system;
    • Study on the mechanism of the impact of Arctic climate change to China's climate.
