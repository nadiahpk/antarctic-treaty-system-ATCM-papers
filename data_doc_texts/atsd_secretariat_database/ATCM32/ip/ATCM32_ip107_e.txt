Chilean Program for Scientific and Technological Research in Antarctica 





Chilean Program for Scientific and 
Technological Research in Antarctica

The Chilean Antarctic Scientific and Technological Research Program, PROCIEN, brings together the projects that are financed, organized, coordinated, and executed by the Chilean Antarctic Institute (Instituto Antártico Chileno - INACH), whether directly or through support of universities and centers for scientific research. Projects request financing from different sources, through an open and transparent competition, subject to peer review.
The scientific activities developed within this Program, are conducted in Antarctica to collect new data and samples and in institutional laboratories to process them and to analyze the results.
INACH promotes four main areas of research, which presents particular strengths in the studying and understanding of the Antarctic environment, its physical and biological characteristics in both past and present, and in the modeling of future scenarios:
	1.    Relationships between South America and Antarctica
	2.    Global warming and climate evolution
	3.    Abundance and diversity of Antarctic organisms
	4.    Antarctic environment and its bioresources
The final objective of this Program is to produce high-quality Chilean Antarctic science, worthy of international recognition and in keeping with Chilean national interests through the delivery of selected studies relating to our cultural, economic and social development. Chile is the country that is closest to Antarctica, and this has resulted in a national imperative to understand, measure, and bring the White Continent closer to all Chileans.
