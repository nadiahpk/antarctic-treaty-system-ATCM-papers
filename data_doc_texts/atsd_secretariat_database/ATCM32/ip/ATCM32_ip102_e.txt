Report of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC)
1. 	Introduction
ASOC is pleased to be in Baltimore to help celebrate the Antarctic Treaty’s 50th anniversary. Indeed, there is much to be celebrating, while recognizing the many challenges facing the Consultative Parties in exercising good stewardship over the 10% of the earth encompassed within the boundaries of the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR.  
ASOC is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year.  ASOC was created in 1978-79 to influence the content of Article II of CCAMLR - the 'ecosystem-as-a-whole' principle; to stop potential minerals development of Antarctica, then under discussion behind closed doors; and to promote greater openness of the Antarctic Treaty System to the participation of environmental groups and the UN system.
This report briefly describes ASOC’s work over the past year, and outlines the key issues identified by ASOC for this ATCM, discussed in detail in our Information Papers. 
The important precedent of holding a joint meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection and CCAMLR’s Scientific Committee also is very welcome. ASOC looks forward to the outputs from this, which we hope among other things will take advantage of the foundations laid in CCAMLR’s bioregionalisation process to make rapid progress in creating a representative system of marine protected areas and marine reserves in the Southern Ocean.
The decision to hold a joint meeting of Arctic Council and Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties is most welcome, and ASOC hopes this precedent will be continued.
2. 	ASOC Worldwide
ASOC has member groups located in most Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. ASOC campaigns are coordinated by a team of specialised representatives – scientists, lawyers and policy experts – located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and USA.
ASOC maintains a Secretariat office in Washington DC, USA, and a website (http://www.asoc.org), which provides details about the organisation and contains all ASOC documents prepared for the Antarctic Treaty System since 2000. Recently we added to the website an archive of all ECO newspapers published since 1980. 
	Information Papers for XXXI ATCM
In addition to this report, ASOC has introduced 8 Information Papers:
    • IP 002: Impacts of Human Activities on the Antarctic Environment: A Review
This Information Paper presents a summary of a peer-reviewed article on the research on human impacts on the southern polar environment from the past decade. Our current knowledge on human impacts on the Antarctic environment highlights the need to: (i) initiate long-term monitoring programmes, (ii) put in place strong measures to prevent the establishment of invasive species, (iii) develop universally accepted standards for the remediation of contaminated sites, (iv) assess and verify the effectiveness of EIA provisions, and (v) apply the precautionary approach. 
    • IP 023: Tourism and Land-Based Facilities in Antarctica
At the request of Japan, ASOC updated information it had previously compiled on land facilities used to support tourism in Antarctica.  This Information Paper describes the current state of land-based tourism and discusses some of the issues associated with such facilities. Although the number of facilities has not changed significantly in recent years, the continued growth of Antarctic tourism means increasing use of land-based facilities, and thus the environmental impact of tourism is more likely.  ASOC encourages Parties to be fully transparent about their tourism-related activities, to develop and make available Policy Statements on tourism with respect to their Antarctic stations, and to be proactive in managing land-based tourism in Antarctica.
    • IP 034: Managing Antarctic Vessels – Avoiding Future Disasters
In this paper, ASOC identifies a number of issues related to vessel operations in Antarctic waters and sets out the actions needed to prevent environmental disasters from groundings, sinkings, fires or other accidents and from day to day operations. In particular, ASOC calls on Parties to work cooperatively within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to commence the development in 2010 of (and to adopt as a matter of urgency) a mandatory legal instrument (or Polar Code) for vessels operating in polar waters; to continue the work on risk assessment and passenger vessels to strengthen the management of passenger vessels in Antarctic waters; and to work to address the associated environmental impacts of all vessels activities in the area, including fisheries, the whaling fleet and ancillary vessels. 
    • IP 035: Policy Implications Arising From SCAR’s Report: Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment
ASOC concludes that the primary, science-based policy implications of the SCAR report are: 1) to support global reductions in carbon emissions, 2) to put in place strong measures to prevent the establishment of invasive species in the Antarctic, and 3) to apply a highly precautionary approach to the conservation of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean. 
    • IP 041: Marine Protected Areas in the Antarctic
The use of Marine Protected Areas and Marine Reserves for the protection and management of the marine environment and resources has long been recognised as desirable and valuable within the agreements and bodies that make up the Antarctic Treaty System. ASOC encourages Parties to reach an agreement at the CEP/SC-CAMLR workshop prior to the XXXII ATCM to specifically outline the process and timelines under which CEP and SC-CAMLR will work cooperatively, recognizing each body’s competency and expertise, towards the site selection and designation of MPAs and marine reserves in the Southern Ocean.
    • IP 048: A Ross Sea MPA: Preservation for Science

ASOC proposes that the Ross Sea be protected from further destruction of its foodweb owing to it being (1), so far, the least affected stretch of continental shelf remaining on Earth, (2) a site of unique evolutionary significance (fishes, penguins, invertebrates) on par with the Galapagos, Lake Baikal and African Great Lakes (all declared World Heritage Sites), (3) a region with globally-significant populations of Adelie (38%) and Emperor (26%) penguins, Antarctic Petrels (30+%), Antarctic minke whales (21%), type-C killer whales (on the order of half), and Weddell seals (undetermined, but the largest colonies in the world).
    • IP 052: Protecting the Antarctic Marine Ecosystem: A Role for the ATCM:
ASOC calls on the ATCM to become more involved in issues related to the protection of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, supporting CCAMLR's efforts to implement an ecosystem approach to the management of Antarctic fisheries, with a current emphasis on Antarctic krill and Patagonian toothfish. Both bodies should consider complementary ways to protect the Antarctic marine ecosystem, especially in the face of climate change. 
    • IP 053: Key Elements of a Strategic Vision for Antarctic Tourism
ASOC argues that there is an urgent need for Antarctic Treaty Parties to develop a clear vision of tourism in the Antarctic and agree on a tourism strategy that delivers, step by step, on that vision through time.  In this Information Paper ASOC outlines a few important principles to achieve this.  In ASOC’s view the unending growth of Antarctic tourism is not desirable, required or inevitable.  Tourism activities in Antarctica should demonstrably have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the environment taken together.  A precautionary approach should be used to manage tourism in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence about tourism impacts.  Certain types of commercial tourism need to be discouraged or prohibited.
Each of these Information Papers suggests steps for the Committee on Environmental Protection, the ATCM and CCAMLR, which ASOC submits are crucial to achieving effective protection of Antarctic ecosystems and wilderness values over the longer term.  In this context, ASOC believes it is important for governments to be thinking about the second fifty years of the Treaty, and to develop a strategic plan for filling the numerous gaps in the present Antarctic Treaty System.  Regulation of commercial tourism and biological prospecting are two key challenges facing the Consultative Parties. 
The papers also highlight the need for closer and more effective working relationships both between the ATCM and CCAMLR, and between the ATS and other international bodies such as the International Maritime Organization, which have competence and expertise relevant to the Southern Ocean protection.
Other Important Issues for XXXI ATCM
4.1 Ratification of Annex VI on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies
Annex VI on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies is an essential complement to the suite of environmental protection instruments mandated by the Protocol.  Bringing this important set of obligations into force as rapidly as possible should be a high priority for all ATCPs.  ASOC urges all parties to redouble their efforts during this ATCM and over the next year to solve the remaining implementation problems, so that Annex VI can be ratified and in force in 2010. Ideally this should be the subject of a Resolution at the 50th anniversary ATCM. 
4.2 Shipping issues
ASOC again suggests that the ATCM promote a joint intersessional contact group with input from CCAMLR and IMO experts to help Parties complete work on risk and passenger shipping, identify critical components of remote search and rescue and environmental response needed, and create a Polar Code on vessel safety and environmental protection measures for Antarctic waters. 
4.3 Biological Prospecting
Biological prospecting is a complex topic that centers on the production and commercial use of knowledge derived from Antarctic biodiversity. Biological prospecting represents a further penetration of commercial and economic interests into Antarctica.  This emerging industry is a completely unregulated activity at present, and ASOC has called for controls to be agreed.  

ASOC remains surprised by the lack of response by Parties to Recommendation 2 of Resolution 7 (2005), which requires Parties to provide information annually on the nature and extent of their biological prospecting activities in the Antarctic Treaty area. This information is essential for the development of a regulatory regime.

Even if sufficient information was available, biological prospecting is a difficult industry to regulate given its complexity, multiple components and ambiguity.  The stakes are high and ASOC hopes that this will motivate Parties to be proactive in regulating this activity.  ASOC is encouraged by the discussions that have taken place the past year.  The existence of international models regulating similar activities, such as the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, offer some possible avenues as to how best to address this complex issue, which Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties should consider and adapt as required.  

ASOC Intersessional Activities since XXXI ATCM

ASOC participated in:
    • intersessional work reviewing management plans for ASPAs and ASMAs, including discussions of the Deception Island Management Group, and informal discussions on site guidelines. 
    • the Intersessional Contact Group on risk assessment and passenger shipping, to which ASOC provided comments and copies of its submissions to IMO bodies.
    • the October 2008 IUCN General Assembly in Barcelona, holding a workshop for delegates on key Antarctic protection issues and sponsoring a Resolution on Antarctica that was approved unanimously by IUCN members.
In addition, ASOC attended:
    • the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Santiago in June 2008 as an accredited observer, introducing a paper calling for a Management Plan for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and supporting the proposal for coordinated long-term research in the Sanctuary. ASOC also attended the March 2009 intersessional meeting of the IWC, in Rome, Italy.
    • the Advisory Group meeting of the Agreement on Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels as an accredited observer in Cape Town, August 2008.
    • the 27th Meeting of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in October 2008, introducing several information papers covering Antarctic krill management, the need for a network of Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean, the impacts of climate change on the Antarctic marine ecosystem, and the need for trade measures in CCAMLR.
    • IMO meetings, including the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 58th Session (October 2008) where ASOC was calling for a comprehensive assessment of all environmental impacts from all forms of vessels operating in Antarctic waters; the Bulk Liquids and Gases sub-committee (BLG) 13th Session (March 2009), which developed a revision to the MARPOL Convention Annex I to ban the carriage and use of heavy grade fuel oil on ships operating in Antarctic waters; and the Ship Design and Equipment sub-committee (DE) 52nd Session, which developed a revised set of Guidelines for ships operating in polar waters. 
    • the Intergovernmental Meeting of Experts on Biological Prospecting in the Antarctic Treaty Area held in Baarn, Netherlands in February 2009, as an invited expert.
    • the Joint CEP/SC CCAMLR workshop prior to the ATCM XXXII, introducing a document outlining opportunities for collaborative work between the two bodies. 
Concluding Remarks
The Antarctic region is facing ever-increasing pressures from global climate change and a diversifying range of activities within the region. ASOC and its member groups around the world hope that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties utilize the opportunity afforded by the 50th anniversary celebration to take concrete actions and make decisions in Baltimore that will protect the Antarctic environment over the long term.  This will take leadership and a willingness to set aside partisan concerns in the larger public interest, in order to meet the responsibilities articulated in the Antarctic Treaty and replicated in all Antarctic Treaty System instruments.
