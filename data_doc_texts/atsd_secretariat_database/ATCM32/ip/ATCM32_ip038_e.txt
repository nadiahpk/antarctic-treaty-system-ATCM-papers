1. The accident
Since the heavy sea ice, “Xuelong” vessel was blocked at 68°59¢59²S; 76°07¢04²E, at 17: 30 on November 27th, 2008. Therefore, the 25th CHINARE decided to unload the cargos onto a comparatively flat sea ice for air transport.
The unloading started at 18:00,  a barge, a small boat and 6 snow sledges and a snow vehicle were unloaded onto the sea ice and the crawler-fixing operation was carried out for other vehicles aboard with the intention for further unloading of materials. 
Based on the observation of the sea ice, it was recognized that there was a possibility of transporting cargos to Zhongshan station by snow vehicle with sledges. Then, 5 snow vehicles and 6 snow sledges was unloaded on the sea-ice from Xuelong. While a PB300 vehicle with only one driver inside moved forward, the sea ice cracked 150m away from the bow of the “Xuelong” and the PB300 vehicle fell into the sea. However, the driver was saved by jumping out of the vehicle. The medical check showed that the driver was in a good health condition. 
2. Environment monitoring
The field operation was stopped after the accident and an investigation was carried out. The survey showed that the dropped snow vehicle carried a half drum of gasoline and few clothes and shoes. The accident site was monitored continuously for 5 days, no oil spill or floating clothes were found. Two days later, helicopters flew twice to check the accident site and no pollution was found.
