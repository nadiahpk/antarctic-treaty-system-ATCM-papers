Report by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) on
“Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters”


Introduction
To ensure safety of life at sea and the protection of the Antarctic marine environment and dependent and associated ecosystems it is require a coordinated effort and a great spirit of cooperation.  The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) plays an important role in this matter through its Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) that meets annually to coordinate hydrographic and nautical cartographic activities. This Report covers the period since the last ATCM and intends to provide a brief summary of the key benchmarks achieved as well as to highlight the challenges for the years to come.
It has been made known to the IHO that the Seminar organized by the HCA at the last ATCM to raise awareness on the importance of Hydrography in Antarctic, triggered a much better understanding between national Antarctic authorities and national Hydrographic authorities, both agreeing on the need to improve the priority assigned to conduct hydrographic surveys in Antarctica and to work closer. The Seminar was considered a success and will be repeated with some slight modification to its content, at the next COMNAP Council in Punta Arenas, Chile, in August 2009. 
The IHO confirms that it continues to assign Antarctica a high priority. The different maritime accidents that have occurred in Antarctica has reinforced the HCA principles of coordination and cooperation with all the relevant international organizations, to improve safety of life at sea, safety of navigation, protection of the marine environment and marine scientific research in Antarctica.     
The IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica
The 8th Meeting of the IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) took place at the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 06-08 October 2008 thanks to the kind invitation of Vice Admiral Luiz Fernando PALMER Fonseca, Hydrographer of Brazil.   

The Chairman, Capt Gorziglia (IHB Director) opened the meeting welcoming the 15 HCA Member States present (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Peru, Spain, United Kingdom, Uruguay and USA) and observers from COMNAP, IAATO and IOC. It has to be highlighted that since the last ATCM, four States have signed the Statutes of the HCA - Japan, Republic of Korea, Uruguay and Venezuela - and therefore have become full members of the Commission, the total number of which is now 23.  (Annex A)


At its last meeting, the Commission considered different matters including the issue of membership, the situation of which was provided above. The status of the action list agreed at the last meeting; the outcome of the XXXI ATCM including the Seminar and the status of nautical charting and the hydrographic survey programme received special consideration. RAdm Ian Moncrieff, National Hydrographer of the UK was elected Vice Chairman of the HCA   
1. Status of Actions Agreed.

The Commission reviewed the status of the actions agreed at the last meeting and confirmed that almost all actions had been completed.  
The provision of Hydrographic Services in Antarctica and the application of SOLAS Convention, Chapter V, Regulation 9, “Hydrographic Services” was thoroughly discussed. While the Commission recognizes that this regulation is not applicable as such to Antarctic waters, it was agreed on the need to raise this subject to the XXXII ATCM.   The recent Resolution 5 (2008) generates a very good platform as it provides a recommendation to Governments on an individual basis. What seems to be missing is an indication from the AT Parties on a collective regulation aiming at assigning hydro-cartographic responsibilities in Antarctica. It is the view of the HCA that AT Parties should consider addressing this subject aiming at setting a position defining obligations/responsibilities for the provision of hydrographic services in Antarctica. Annex B contains Regulation 9, the text of which could be used for developing a particular regulation for the Antarctic Treaty area.    
The importance to keeping national ATCM delegates well informed by their corresponding national hydrographic authorities on IHO/HCA activities was found to be very important and in-line with the scope of ATCM Resolution 5 (2008) on “Improving hydrographic surveying and charting to support safety of navigation in the Antarctic region”.  It is the Commission’s view that this sort of briefing should be considered as a permanent action to keep alive and enhance government support.
The Commission appreciated the strong support it receives from related international organizations, such as the ATS, IMO, IOC, COMNAP and IAATO. The GEBCO IHO/IOC program together with SCAR and the IBCSO project also merit especial mention. 
2. Outcome of the XXXI ATCM and Seminar.
The Commission received with great enthusiasm the increased interest ATCM has been giving to hydrographic, nautical cartographic and marine safety information on Antarctica. ATCM Resolution 5 already mentioned, constitutes a clear and strong message to the Antarctic Treaty signatories Governments on the need to adopt all possible measures to gather hydrographic information suitable for the production of more reliable nautical charts. 
The IHO would like to thanks those Governments that submitted working papers on the matter and proposed and supported the Resolution. 
With regard to the Seminar organized by the IHO/HCA, the Commission discussed the very positive expressions received after the Seminar from various ATCM Delegates. Comments were very encouraging and the Commission agreed to thank ATCM for the opportunity offered to share IHO/HCA views on the status of nautical cartography and its effects on safety to navigation and protection of the marine environment. The Commission has also received a good feedback from the scientific community. Several national hydrographic authorities have been approached by their governmental agencies dealing with Antarctic, requesting more details of the situation. In brief, the Seminar seems to have built a bridge between national parties with similar interests but not working in a necessarily coordinated manner.
Concrete effects, such as an increase in hydrographic data gathering - hydrographic survey days in Antarctica -, or acceleration in the production on INT Charts cannot be assessed at this stage due to the short period elapsed, but we are optimistic that Resolution 5 (2008) will be seriously considered by the Antarctic Treaty Governments. 
Following this Seminar, HCA is planning to deliver similar events at COMNAP and IAATO main meetings in 2009 and 2010 respectively.   
3. Status of Nautical Charting.  
The situation with regard to chart production is provided in detail in Annex C. 
The INT Chart scheme includes 100 charts. Nowadays two new charts proposed by Brazil to cover the area of Elephant Island are under consideration.  It has to be kept in mind that from time to time new requirements arise. The procedure HCA follows is that before accepting any new chart into the scheme, the proposal is closely examined by the HCA. 
Till December 2009, 65 INT Charts will have been published, leaving 35 in the pending list. Special attention shall be given to the modest expectation on future production, as it is indicated bellow: 
    a) 3 charts are planned to be produced in 2010
    b) 1 chart is planned for 2011
    c) 4 charts are planned for 2012
    d) 1 chart is planned for 2013
    e) 0 chart is planned for 2014
    f) 5 charts are planned for “ no earlier than 2015” 
    g) 21 charts have not yet been considered in the planning. 

It is evident that if there is no change in the priority assigned by Governments to hydrographic surveying and nautical chart production, it is likely that the existing INT Chart scheme will not be completed before year 2025. The IHO/HCA is extremely concerned about this situation. 
The Commission is aware of the effort made by Australia, Chile, France, Italy, Norway and UK to produce ENC of Antarctic waters.   13 overview; 3 coastal; 5 approaches, 4 harbour, and one berthing ENC are available. Other 9 are in production.  The ENC scheme for small scale has been approved and the ENC scheme for medium scale is under revision. The scheme follows that of the INT chart on which the ENC has been based. 
4. Hydrographic Surveying Programme.
The Commission is fully aware that it is urgent to assign a high priority to hydrographic survey activities. At the last HCA meeting, its Chairman suggested the HCA Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group to meet separately in order to review the existing terms of reference (dated 2004) and recommend concrete actions the Commission could take to move forward in line with the existing needs.  
The WG offered updated terms of reference and a new name for the WG. Both were agreed and the actual name for the WG is “HCA Survey Prioritization WG”. 
The Commission tasked the WG to update the prioritized hydrographic survey plan approved at HCA in 2007, taking into consideration National Reports as well as discussions/outcome of the ad-hoc meeting of the WG. The Commission appreciated the offer made by COMNAP and IAATO to contribute to this work as Observers. The document to be prepared by the WG shall provide guidance on the priorities required to improve the INT Chart production. 
5. Next HCA Meeting. 
Following the kind invitation from the Hydrographer of South Africa, the Commission accepted with thanks and agreed to have the 9th HCA meeting in Cape Town, South Africa,  12-14 October 2009. 


Conclusions

    1. The IHO/HCA, supported by several international organizations and projects continues to facilitate the coordination and cooperation in hydrographic surveying and nautical chart production of Antarctic waters, therefore contributing to safety to navigation and protection of the marine environment. 
    2. Despite the efforts made to raise awareness of the importance of assigning a higher priority to hydrography, the IHO/HCA is concerned by the extremely low progress achieved in terms of nautical chart production. This has two causes, one is the very few hydrographic surveys conducted and the second is the low priority assigned to the cartographic processes.  
    3. The examination of Regulation 9 of SOLAS V by ATCM might help in identifying a way by which AT Governments could feel more committed to allocate resources to conduct  hydrographic surveys and consequently produce the nautical chart  of the areas  which have voluntarily expressed their willingness to be a “producer nation”.  
    4. The Seminar organized by the IHO/HCA allowed to share with the XXXI ATCM Delegates the concern of the hydrographic community derived from the low hydrographic activity in Antarctica.  Resolution 5 (2008) recommending Governments, among others, to cooperate with HCA, constitutes a sign of the ATS’s interest that we expect shall have positive effects on the insufficient level of provision of timely, reliable and updated hydro-cartographic  information, products and services of Antarctica.  

Recommendations

It is recommended that the XXXII ATCM: 
    1. Takes note of the IHO Report. 
    2. Takes action as regard to the conclusions in the Report.
