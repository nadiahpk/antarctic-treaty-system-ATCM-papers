This paper gives a brief report on the Management Group’s activities to date.
Background
At CEP X Australia, China, India, Romania and the Russian Federation submitted ATCM XXX/WP 8 Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. Antarctic Specially Managed Area Management Plan. The CEP and ATCM endorsed the joint proposal to designate a new ASMA in the Larsemann Hills, which was adopted as ASMA 6 by Measure 2 (2007). The Management Plan aims to protect the Larsemann Hills environment by promoting coordination and cooperation by Parties in the planning and conduct of human activities. Consistent with the approach taken for several other ASMAs, the Parties active in the Area have established an international Management Group to oversee the management plan’s implementation.
Management Group activities
Available members of the Larsemann Hills ASMA Management Group met in Washington in July 2007 and in St Petersburg in July 2008.
The Management Group has adopted the following Terms of Reference:

    • Discuss implementation of the Management Plan.
    • Coordinate joint action by the Parties active in the Area to implement the provisions of the Management Plan.
    • Review the effectiveness of the Management Plan and revise it as necessary.
At Management Group meetings and through intersessional communications, the Parties active in the Area have exchanged information on operational and scientific activities carried out and planned in the Larsemann Hills region. Of particular note is the agreement to implement practical quarantine measures developed in accordance with Section 6.2 of the ASMA Management Plan, as reported to CEP XI in ATCM XXXI / IP 17 Measures to protect the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica from the introduction of non-native species. India has also updated the Management Group on progress with plans for construction of its new station at the designated place in the Larsemann Hills.

The next Management Group meeting will be held in August in Punta Arenas, Chile, to coincide with the meeting of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs.
