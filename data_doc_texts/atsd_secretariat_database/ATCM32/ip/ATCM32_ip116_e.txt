The opportunity of the Arctic Treaty introduction, as the boreal equivalent of the Antarctic Treaty, for the peace and progress of mankind in the 21st century

Signed in Washington, DC, on 1 December 1959 by twelve (seven claimant and five non-claimant) nations and unanimously ratified on 23 June 1961, “in the interest of all mankind” and “for peaceful purposes only” [1], the Antarctic Treaty is “a document unique in history” [2]. It emanated from “the freedom of scientific investigation in Antarctica as applied during the International Geophysical Year” (1957-1958) and successfully resisted for the past 50 years. The Antarctic Treaty has evolved into the System covering not yet just the international governance for the Antarctic continent and its surrounding seas, but also resource management [3] [such as Convention on the conservation of Antarctic Seals (London 1972) and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resource (Canberra 1980)] [4]. 
Because the Antarctic Treaty has prohibited “any measures of a military nature” (Article I) and “any nuclear explosions in Antarctica and the disposal there of radioactive waste material” (Article V), and has frozen “any right of or claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica… while the…Treaty is in force” (Article IV), a progressively increasing number of nations adhered to this Treaty. Today, the area south of 60 deg South Latitude applied the Antarctic Treaty representing nearly 10% of the Earth is managed by 47 nations representing nearly 90% of humankind [1, 2, 5]. “The substantial research” provided by scientific international cooperation of a wide range of nations with cultures and political and legal systems has consolidated the Antarctic Treaty. 
Although, the Treaty was initially dumb with respect to the exploitation of resources, Antarctica was salved from the danger of natural resource exploitation in 1991, when the ratification of the Treaty for a 30 years-period expired. Signed in Madrid on October 4, 1991 and entered in force in 1998, the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol) [6a] designates “Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science” (Art. 2) and prohibits “any activity relating to mineral resources, other than science research” (Art. 7) until 2048, but even more, as this interdiction is renewable for an indefinite term and may be removed only with unanimous agreement of all Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty until 2048 [6b] and ¾ of these Parties after this data, and only if a binding legal regime on Antarctic mineral resource activities is in force (Art. 25.5). 
Nothing of this kind may be said about the Arctic, an enormous area [7] sprawling over one sixth of the earths’ landmass [8a] where the global warming increases the chance of access to the huge potential of resources existent in the depth of the Arctic Ocean and opens new maritime ways, but with consequences such as the tension of the geo-political context [9] and the pollution of the Arctic environment [10] with global impacts. Taking into account this danger, the Antarctic Treaty promotes a more closely collaboration with the Arctic Council and a bipolar scientific cooperation according to the Declaration of Edinburgh on International Polar Year (IPY) [11]. 
The Arctic Council, formally established by the Ottawa Declaration of 1996, originates in the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy signed by the eight Arctic countries [8b] in 1991 when the Madrid Protocol to Antarctic Treaty was signed. But only the Arctic States have the right to vote in this council while the non-Arctic States has observer status by reason that they do not have territorial claims in the Arctic Circle [8c].
However, the Arctic Ocean does not belong to any country, because the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (UNCLOS) entered into force on 16 November 1994 [12] has declared that “the area of the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of the jurisdiction, as well as its resources, are the common heritage of mankind, the exploration and exploitation of which be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole, irrespective of the geographical location of States” (Preamble). 
Nevertheless, UNCLOS does not offer warranties for the international right over the Arctic area, because contain a compromise, namely it provides, on the one hand, that exclusive economic zone (EEZ), in which the coastal State exerts its “sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living” and “jurisdiction… regard to… the protection and preservation of the marine environment” (Art. 56), “shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles…” (Art. 57), while, on the other hand, it stipulates that it may be extended (Art. 76.4) if the continental plateau stretches on a greater distance (Art. 76.6).        
This exception incites to territorial claims even if UNCLOS stipulates that “the submerged prolongation of the land mass of the coastal State… does not include the deep ocean floor with its ocean ridges or the subsoil thereof” (Art. 76.3). As regards the eventuality of the establishment of the outer limits of coastal State continental shelf (Art. 76.8) in the present international Arctic waters (even up to the Lomonosov Ridge [9] next to the North Pole), outlined by the declared political strategies [13], at stake is the access to the 20-25% of the unexploited world oil and gas fields in subsoil of the Antarctic Ocean.
Unlike Antarctica, which is protected by the Antarctic Treaty System, through which the territorial claims and the economic exploitation activities of the natural resources are prohibited in order to the Antarctic environment protection, the Arctic does not benefit at present by a similar international statute and it can be claimed and exploited by the Arctic States. 
Invoking the international governance and protection for the Arctic following the successful example of the Antarctic Treaty System, the European Union analyzes the opportunity of the extension of the Arctic area governance and the regulation of the Arctic environment protection [14], but also of the benefits of the exploitation of its resources [15]. The multitude of data regarding the polar and global (negative and positive) impacts of the climate change collected during IPY 2007-2008 will be synthesized as soon as possible.         
In this geo-political and scientific context, it would be necessary to initiate international negotiations for the regulation of the statute of the Arctic Ocean and of the Arctic sea, including those of the North Atlantic and of the North Pacific Oceans, which should lead the drawing up and to the adoption of the document that could be named the Arctic Treaty. This Treaty should include provisions regarding the environment protection and the transformation of this immense area of the planet into a zone of peace and science. The Arctic Treaty will assure the juridical frame for the development of an Arctic Treaty System, in accordance with the model of the Antarctic Treaty System. Like the latter, a future Arctic Treaty System should include a Protocol on Environment Protection similar to the Madrid Protocol to Antarctic Treaty. On the other hand, the environment protection and the scientific activity in the Arctic will be regulated by taking into account the existent international conventions regarding the sea transport and the environment pollution.
