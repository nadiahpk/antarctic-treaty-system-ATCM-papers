Revision of Maps for Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 2: McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land





Revision of Maps for
Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 2:
McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land
Introduction
Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land, adopted through Measure 1 (2004) following a proposal by New Zealand and the United States of America, has provided a valuable basis for management of this important region for almost five years. In accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Madrid Protocol New Zealand and the United States have initiated a review of the management plan and are in the process of updating provisions as necessary.
The review thus far has identified that improvements to maps of the Area would be particularly useful. While existing maps have provided considerable detail for Facilities Zones in particular, there has been a general lack of maps to portray the Special Features within the Area. As such, many people using the management plan have found it difficult to identify these features in the field, making the management guidance that applies more difficult to understand and to follow. In addition, some additional contextual information was seen as useful for the Facilities Zones, helping visitors to interpret these sites more easily in the context of their surrounding environmental features such as lakes, shorelines, glacial features, and the local topography.
Mapping improvements
To address current map limitations, a program of data acquisition was undertaken to enable development of new, updated and improved products in support of the management plan. In particular, a selection of high-resolution color Quickbird satellite imagery data was acquired from Digital Globe Inc. covering the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. While high quality color aerial photography is available from the mission undertaken in the Dry Valleys by NZ and the US in 1993, key benefits to using the satellite data were the wider spatial coverage and recency of acquisition, all having been acquired over the last five years. This was important because many of the sites of Special Features and Facilities Zones were not covered by the earlier photography, and also because some of the physical features – such as lake levels and ice front positions – have changed since the earlier photography. However, the aerial photography remains of superior resolution and also offers the possibility of topographic map improvements using orthophotography techniques, so in practice both sets of imagery are being used.
A program of ground control acquisition was initiated to tie imagery accurately to ground features, and digital techniques are being used to develop planimetrically accurate base maps.
Map product development
Given the relatively large area within ASMA No. 2, and the variety of Facilities Zones and Special Features throughout, a total of 18 new site maps are under development (Table 1 and Figure 1).
The maps are initially being designed making use of the available imagery to identify important geographical features. An example is provided in Figure 2, showing the Sand Dune Field Special Feature located in Victoria Valley. Existing maps provide only a general indication of the location of the feature, and previously no map showing the extent or the nature of the feature was available. These improvements are anticipated to aid interpretation of the site in the field, assisting both site management and protection as well as assisting scientific studies.
While imagery has been essential to interpret and map such features, it is recognised that map products need to be suitable for use in a range of contexts, including in the field, within Antarctic Treaty documents, for environmental assessment reports, as well as adapted for use in scientific publications. It is therefore intended that black and white line drawing versions will be prepared based on the image data, ensuring that final products will be clear and reproducible for the range of anticipated uses. Specifically, a revised version of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Field Manual is under development and versions of the maps will be customised to fit this format for easy use in the field.
Work will continue on map product development over the coming year, as New Zealand and the United States work towards completion of the management plan review with the aim of submission of the revised products for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection in 2010.
