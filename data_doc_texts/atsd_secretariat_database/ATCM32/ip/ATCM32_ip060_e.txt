On Spot Technical Assistance: Availability of Hydrogaphic Experts for Vessels of  Opportunity collecting Hydrographic data, by the Uruguayan Antarctic Program in the Antarctic Peninsula Area during next austral summers 

Introduction
    • The ATCM issued the Resolution 5 (2008) - ATCM XXXI, Kyiv: Improving hydrographic surveying and charting to support safety of navigation and environmental protection in the Antarctic region
    • By COMNAP's request, the IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA) is updating the guidelines for collection of hydrographic data with ships of opportunity.
    • The Antarctic Peninsula is an area heavily used by shipping for scientific research, tourism to Antarctica and logistic support operations to Antarctica, yacht races and other yachting trips and adventure trips. Some of them may collect hydrographic data and will follow the HCA guidelines. 
    • Giving further training to  ship masters to follow the recommended guidelines in order to collect the data with the needed accuracy, will improve the results and avoid later deletion as well as to help with validation of existing data. This may be done with trained Hydrographers onboard the vessels going to Antarctica providing on the spot assistance and training for a small period of time till they become familiar with the instruments and procedures. 
    • Training can be done at the field onboard Ships of Opportunity, during short cruises, for example, at the Antarctic Peninsula Area or in case of passengers vessels, while they are disembarking passengers at a landfall such as the King George Island. 

Proposal : 

    •  The Uruguay National Antarctic Program is able and ready to provide a Hydrographer free of charge to train non survey vessel who wish to participate on the surveys a vessels of opportunity on how to use the issued guidelines. This will be done by embarking a  hydrographer , without instruments, from the National Hydrographic Office  at significant landfalls of heavy traffic such as the  King George Island. They will based at Artigas station, Maxwell bay, Fildes Peninsula for the 2009-2010 season. The cost of the on the spot assistance will be assumed by the party and will only include the technician itself. Contact and further details can be provided at :

    • The Uruguay National Antarctic Program also offered their station as a collection point for any other hydrographer of other nationalities who wish also to collaborate in the training on the spot. From there he can be picked up by any vessel for the necessary training. Meals and accommodation will be free of charge at Artigas station for the hydrographer. .
