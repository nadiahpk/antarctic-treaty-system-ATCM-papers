There will be laboratories and state of art equipment. Research will be performed aiming to get knowledge on the connection processes between the Antarctic continent and South America.. A  multibeam echo sounder system and a ADCP system (600 meters) will be installed on the vessel. Scientific laboratories for oceanography, atmospheric science, geophysics, and biology are being set up. Two UH-13 helicopters will assist scientific field operations as well.
