ASPA and ASMA management plans: review of provisions relating to non-native species introductions
CEP Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The introduction of non-native species and transfer of locally indigenous biota around Antarctica presents a major potential threat to Antarctic biodiversity.  This Information Paper:

    • reviews the provisions set out in ASPA and ASMA management plans concerning non-native species introductions and; 

    • sets out the background information for the associated Working Paper (WP 33) ‘Review of provisions relating to non-native species introductions in ASPA and ASMA management plans’.
Background
For around 30 million years, the transfer of non-native species to Antarctica has been limited by the continent’s isolation from other landmasses by the Southern Ocean and circumpolar air currents.  However, the potential for non-native species to access the continent has increased due to human activity in the region in the last two centuries.  Around 4,000 science and support personnel and over 30,000 tourists land in Antarctica annually.  As human visitation and movement around the continent increases, so does the opportunity for non-native species introductions and dispersal of locally indigenous Antarctic biota.  Species may be transported into and around Antarctica associated with visitor’s clothing and personal belongs, cargo, vehicles, foodstuffs and building materials.  

The movement of species from areas where they are indigenous to areas where they are not naturally found creates the opportunity for major disruption of existing Antarctic ecosystems.  Some sub-Antarctic island ecosystems have undergone significant transformation due to the impacts of non-native species (including plants, invertebrates, vertebrates and microorganisms) that have been introduced through human activities in the last 200 years (Frenot, 2005).  

The Antarctic terrestrial environment has experienced few proven introductions (four as of 2009: two grasses and two invertebrates, all within the vicinity of Antarctic research stations), but the effect of climate warming and precipitation changes in Antarctic Peninsula may make this region more suitable for colonisation by introduced species (Convey, 2008; Tin et al., 2009).  The potential impacts of non-native species introductions to Antarctic and sub-Antarctic ecosystems, and the likely influence of climate change, have been review extensively by Frenot et al. (2005; 2008) and Convey (2008). 

Provisions relating to non-native species introductions within the Antarctica Treaty Area are found in The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991) (Environmental Protocol) and within most management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs).  Provisions within the Environmental Protocol are largely aimed at intentional introductions of non-native species (New Zealand, 2006).  Further consideration may need to be given as to whether the existing provisions adequately address the issue of unintentional introductions of non-native species to Antarctica, or if more explicit obligations should be included (Mansfield and Gilbert, 2008). 

Protected Area management plans are one of the few sources of provisions relating to accidental introduction of non-native species within the Antarctic Treaty System.  This paper makes a preliminary examination of Aims, Restriction, Measures and other relevant text in ASPA and ASMA management plans relating to non-native species, with the aim of assessing the clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness of those management plan provisions for Areas where translocation or introduction of non-native species is a concern.   Here we present the raw data from our study, and make some preliminary observations.  

Recommendations from this review are set out in the associated Working Paper (WP 33) ‘Review of provisions relating to non-native species introductions in ASPA and ASMA management plans’.

Review of management plan provisions relating to non-native species
The 70 ASPA and seven ASMA management plans were downloaded from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat website at: http://www.ats.aq/documents/cep/Register%20updated%202008_e.pdf.  

ASPA management plans with Annex V formatting were examined for text on (1) non-native species and (2) pathogens in the following sections: 

Section 1. Description of values to be protected

Section 2. Aims and objectives
Section 7(v). Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area
Section 7(ix). Measures that may be necessary to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Management Plan can continue to be met.  

Management plans not in Annex V format or undergoing Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) review were not included in the analysis.

Figure 1 shows the location of the 70 ASPAs and 7 ASMAs within the Antarctic Treaty Area.  Table 1 presents a summary of the data on non-native species and pathogens in ASPA management plans that focus on (A) island communities, (B) mainland and coastal communities, (C) benthic marine communities and (D) non-biological values presented in the Appendices.  

The Appendices also record for each ASPA, the ASPA area (km2) and the distance to the nearest ice-free ground outside the ASPA (km).  This information is represented graphically in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.  

Table 2 presents information relating to non-native species and pathogens contained in ASMA management plans.

Discussion 

The Environmental Protocol does not deal specifically with the issue of accidental introduction of non-native species, which has left a gap that some protected area management plans have tried to fill, in differing degrees of detail:  


ASPAs

Annex V formatting of ASPA management plans present a template for Parties to add Aims, Measures and Restrictions that are specific for the environmental management of the Area that is being proposed for protection.  In some cases, management plan text concerning non-native species has been carried over from existing management plans with out adequate consideration of its relevance to the new Area under consideration.  For example:

    1. In two ASPAs that protect historical sites, the management plans include biosecurity measures to prevent transfer of non-native species and pathogens from poultry into the Area.  There is no clear reason why these measures have been included as the Areas contain no biological communities that required additional protection.  

    2. A management plan for an ASPA protecting benthic marine communities, and without a terrestrial component within the Area, prohibits the introduction of poultry products, but fails to explain what this actually meant in practice for those aboard ship.  

    3. 80% of ASPAs protecting non-biological values (e.g. historical or geological values) contain restrictions on the introduction of non-natives species.  While some sites may require additional protection, (e.g. due to high levels of visitation), it is generally unclear why other sites require protection from non-native species, over and above the surrounding terrain.

Using previously agreed text from existing management plans may be common practice, but the copied text must be appropriate for the new Area being protected.  

ASPA management plan: Aims

When we consider the management plans of all the ASPAs specifically protecting biological values, only 67% have the explicit Aim to minimise the possibility of introduction of non-species and only 11% have the Aim to minimise the possibility of introduction of disease-causing pathogens to the Area (see Table 1).  However, almost all ASPAs protecting terrestrial and marine biological values have restrictions on the introduction of non-native species (98%), and c. 88% of ASPAs protecting bird or marine mammal communities have restrictions on the introduction of pathogens.  When first viewed, these figures would suggest that the issue is being given appropriate levels of consideration, but when the restrictions and measures in the management plans are examined more closely, they are general limited in their scope and lack comprehensive practical details on implementation of biosecurity measures. 

Where pathogens and non-native species are mentioned in ASPA management plan Aims the text often reads: ‘minimise the possibility of introduction of pathogens which may cause disease in bird populations within the Area’ and ‘minimise the possibility of introduction of alien plants, animals and microbes to the Area’.  These Aims should probably be extended, not only to the ASPAs protecting terrestrial and coastal communities (total area: ~1,470 km2 of ocean, ice and ice-free ground; see Figure 2), but to all Antarctic ice-free ground (44,890 km2) if not Antarctica as a whole (13,829,430 km2).  ASPA and ASMAs encompass only around 2% and 13%, respectively, of Antarctica’s ice-free ground.  Management plans are of limited use for managing non-native species introductions due to the small area of ground under special protection relative to the total area of Antarctic ice-free ground that is vulnerable to non-native species introductions.  The lack of provisions relating to accidental introduction of non-native species within the Environmental Protocol in areas outside ASPAs and ASMAs may require further consideration by CEP.  


ASPA management plan: Restrictions

Restrictions on non-native species in management plans often include the sentence ‘No living animals, plant material or microorganisms shall be deliberately introduced into the Area and precautions shall be taken against accidental introductions’, but further explanation of how this is to be achieved is often absent.  While widely present in management plans, the restrictions aimed at preventing bird pathogens entering the Area are generally limited to ‘No poultry products, including dried food containing egg powder, are to be taken into the Area’ without any further explanation that may help those subject to the management plan conditions.

ASPA management plan: Measures

Where biosecurity measures are detailed, they are often limited to ‘To minimise the risk of introductions, before entering the Area, visitors shall thoroughly clean footwear and any equipment, particularly sampling equipment and markers to be used in the Area’.  Given (a) the diversity of biological organisms that could be introduced, (b) the complexities of species transfer mechanisms, (c) the methods by which visitors may arrive at an ASPA and move around and work within it and (d) the opportunity for camping within or near the boundary to an ASPA, these commonly written Measures may be considered limited in their scope.  As a result, the effectiveness and sufficiency of Measures and Restriction in management plans, particularly in light of continuing advances in scientific research on non-native species and biological transfer mechanisms, would appear to be open to question and merit further consideration by the CEP.  

Some management plans do provide some degree of justification for the limited biosecurity precautions they recommend, e.g.: ‘Visitors shall take special precautions against the introduction of alien organisms to the Area. Of particular concern are pathogenic, microbial or vegetation introductions sourced from soils, flora or fauna at other Antarctic sites, including research stations, or from regions outside Antarctica. To minimise the risk of introductions, before entering the Area, visitors shall thoroughly clean footwear and any equipment to be used in the Area, particularly sampling equipment and markers.’  Nevertheless, these directions are rarely comprehensive enough to provide adequate protection.  For example, the Measures do not define ‘clean’.  Should the clothing and equipment be free of soil and macrobiota, or should precautions be taken to sterilize all clothing and equipment entering the Area?  Determining which level of quarantine is correct will depend on the specific biological values and communities being protected within the Area, and the nature of the science activity being undertaken. 

Comprehensive site-specific biosecurity measures have been developed for a small number of ASPAs.  For example, between them, ASPA 170 ‘Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula’, ASPA 130 ‘Tramway Ridge, Mt. Erebus, Ross Island’ and ASPA 118 ‘Summit Of Mount Melbourne, Victoria Land’ provide practical biosecurity measures relating to aircraft, land vehicles, camping gear, science equipment and clothing.  While these management plans provide a useful source of reference, their biosecurity measures may not be appropriate or comprehensive enough for all protected Areas.

Distance from ASPA boundary to the nearest ice-free ground

Introduced species do not respect protected area boundaries.  If introduced close to an ASPA, non-native species are likely to spread into the ASPA, as many Areas contain habitats suitable for biological colonisation.  With this in mind, the use of effective quarantine and biosecurity measures by (a) personnel entering the protected area and (b) by personnel remaining outside the ASPAs may be equally important.  Within Antarctica, 62.5% of ASPAs have ice-free ground adjacent to their boundary and almost 90% of ASPAs have ice-free ground less than 1 km from their boundary (Figure 3).  If non-native species are introduced to this ground, which is rarely given consideration within management plans, the potential for introduced species spreading to the ASPA is increased.

Some management plans may, through lack of clarity, increase the likelihood of non-native species being introduced just outside the ASPA:

1. If cleaning of footwear, clothing and equipment is made a condition of entry to an ASPA, few management plan state the location where this cleaning should occur.  If cleaning is performed at the boundary to the ASPA, any non-native species present on footwear, clothing and equipment up to that point, may become established outside the ASPA boundary, but then quickly spread into the protected Area.  This may become an important issue if several biologically distinct sites are visited during one field trip, which would necessitate the repeated cleaning of clothing and equipment in the field. 

2.  Only rarely is camping within an ASPA permitted.  If a visit to an ASPA lasting more than one day is required, personnel generally set up field camp just outside the ASPA boundary.  Camping equipment can be difficult to clean and sterilise effectively, and may be a major source of biological propagules from other biologically distinct locations.  Propagules from the camping equipment may be able to colonise on ice-free ground at the campsite, from where they may spread into the ASPA. 

Of the ASPAs protecting island communities, 14 out of 17 are within 600 m of ice-free ground where site-specific biosecurity measures to protect the Area are not in place.  Of these, three ASPAs include mainland that is joined to ice-free ground outside the ASPA.  Propagules of non-native species may be transferred across these short distances by natural dispersal mechanisms (wind borne, transfer on birds or marine mammals).  As before, Measures or Restrictions that apply within the ASPA may be of little practical use if non-native species are accidentally introduced by humans outside the Area, from where they may be transported into the Area.  

ASPAs under threat from non-native species

ASPA 128 ‘Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island’ and ASPA 134 ‘Cierva Point and offshore Islands, Danco Coast’ are both are under direct threat of invasion by introduced species.  ASPA 128 already contains the non-native grass species Poa annua.  This plant was originally found at the nearby Arctowski Station in the 1985/86 season, from where it has since expanded into the ASPA (Chwedorzewska, 2008).  Another non-native grass, Poa pratensis, has been reported in the vicinity of Primavera Station which is adjacent to ASPA 134 (Corte, 1961).  It is not known if the distribution of this plant has changed in the 13 years since the last report in the scientific literature (Smith, 1996).  The control and management of these non-native species have been given little specific attention in either ASPA management plan.  

ASPAs protecting benthic marine communities

Of the four ASPAs protecting benthic marine communities that are in Annex V format, two of the management plants prohibit the deliberate introduction of non-native species into the Area.  However, neither management plan includes biosecurity measures to prevent accidental introductions of non-native species.  Biosecurity measures for benthic marine communities within ASPAs have received relatively little attention, possibly as a result of the assumed difficulty of implementing effective biosecurity measures for ships. 

ASMAs

Examination of the ASMA management plans revealed little consistency in biosecurity measures across the Areas (see Table 2).  It must be acknowledged that the absence of information on non-native species in ASMA 3 Cape Denison and ASMA 5 South Pole Station, may reflect their reasons for being created, i.e. to manage historic and non-biological scientific values, respectively.  However, the other ASMAs, which do contain terrestrial, marine, bird and marine mammal communities, in most cases provide few practical guidelines on limiting non-native species introductions.  Where mention of introduced species is made, the ASMA management plan text is often borrowed from ASPA management plans.  Guidance generally is limited to (a) cleaning of scientific equipment between sampling locations (particularly lakes) and (b) avoiding the introduction of non-native species through cleaning of clothing and personal equipment.

The nations operating in ASMA 6 Larsemann Hills have generated a brief 13 point list of ‘Measures to protect the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, from the introduction of non-native species’ (Australia et al., 2008).  The measures show a greater degree of consideration of the issue compared to the other ASMA management plans, but do not provide details on how they are to be put into practice.  A expanded version of these measures, with guidelines on implementation, might be applied usefully to Antarctic as a whole.  None of the other ASMA management plans mention biosecurity measures to limit transfer of non-natives species by the most probable routes, i.e. land vehicles, fixed-wing and rotary aircraft,  in construction material, general cargo and foodstuffs, with the exception of field parties’ use of uncooked poultry products in ASMA 4 Deception Island.

Other sources of relevant biosecurity measures

Recently the Antarctic Community has taken steps to reduce the impact of non-native species introductions on terrestrial biological habitats.  The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) has produced an ‘Environmental code of conduct for terrestrial scientific field research in Antarctica code of conduct for scientists undertaking field work in the terrestrial environment’ (SCAR 2008).  The guidelines are not mandatory, but provide some general limited advice for scientists working throughout Antarctica.  Some national operators have implemented their own biosecurity measures which are more stringent than those required by the Environmental Protocol.  However, the effectiveness of these measures is diminished if biosecurity measures of an equivalent standard are not adopted by all Treaty Parties. 

Conclusion

Management plans are not appropriate tools for managing non-native species introductions to Antarctica.  A comprehensive continent-wide strategy for controlling non-native species that is endorsed and enforced by all Treaty Parties, non-governmental organisations and the tourist industry may be the only effective way of limiting non-native species introductions and spread.

3  Restrictions and biosecurity measures for pathogens: e.g. ‘No poultry products, including dried food containing egg powder, are to be taken into the Area.’ 
4 Biosecurity measures are more comprehensive: e.g. ‘Sterile protective overclothing shall be worn. The overclothing shall be suitable for working at temperatures of -20oC or below and comprise at a minimum sterile overalls to cover arms, legs and body and sterile gloves suitable for placing over the top of cold-weather gloves. Disposable sterile/protective foot coverings are not suitable for the scoria surface and should not be used. Instead, all footwear should be thoroughly brushed to remove soil particles and wipes with 70 percent ethanol.  Both the interior and exterior of helicopters should be cleaned as far as practicable before landing within Area.
