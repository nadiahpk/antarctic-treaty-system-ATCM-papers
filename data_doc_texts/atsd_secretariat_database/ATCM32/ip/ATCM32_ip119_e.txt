Report of activities of Antarctic tourism cruise ships operating from Ushuaia during austral summer season 2008/2009



Summary
This document represents a summary of the main activities of cruise ships that have visited Antarctica during 2008/2009, operating from the port of Ushuaia.

Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W) is located at the southern end of South America, and is the most active Gateway city to Antarctica, in terms of Antarctic cruise ship traffic, receiving more than 90% of the overall cruise totals.   
Over time, development of new infrastructure at Ushuaia’s airport and port has contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to expand their Antarctic operating schedules.  
Among these operators, a distinction should be made between those vessels which make landings and those which, usually of a much larger size, just sail Antarctic waters without making any landings. Similarly, a further distinction can be made between those large vessels which arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American itinerary, and those which use Ushuaia’s port as an operational base to visit Antarctica.  
In general terms, a typical cruise ship operation in Ushuaia includes passenger turnaround, maritime and tour services, as well as general supply of provisions. 
The report’s information is based on crew and passenger lists duly provided by cruise ships to Argentine authorities. When available, this information has been compared to itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites. 

Brief summary of the Antarctic cruise ships activities operating from Ushuaia during the austral summer season 2008/2009
Antarctic cruise ships began their operations on October 9th 2008, when the IB Kapitan Khlebnicov (Quark Expeditions) set sail from Ushuaia for Antarctica, and finished on April 5th 2009 when the MV Akademik Ioffe  arrived in Ushuaia from the Antarctic Peninsula. 
Out of 245 planned trips to Antarctica, only 233 actually took place. Thirty six vessels were part of these operations, with January being the most active month followed by December and February (see Figure 1). 








Figure 1: Number of arrivals in Ushuaia from Antarctica (Summer 2008/2009)

	












A total of 35.687 tourists visited Antarctica passing through Ushuaia. Of these, 22.947 both departed from and arrived back in Ushuaia (64%); 2834 tourists either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia (8%) and 9906 tourists visited Ushuaia in transit to or from other ports en route to or from Antarctica (28%). 

Some 86% of these tourists traveled on board vessels carrying less than 500 passengers, and some 14% did so on vessels with more than 500 passengers. Such a distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Resolution 4 (2007). Table 1 and Figure 2 show average crew and passenger numbers. The report also includes data from two yachts, MY Bark Europa y MY Hanse Explorer.

Figure 2: Average passenger numbers per vessel. Season 2008/2009

Note: These data are an average of each vessels total number of trips during the season. 

In addition, 58% of these vessels operated regularly throughout the season from/to Ushuaia. Each of these vessels made between 7 and 12 trips to Antarctica (See Table 2). These vessels carried an average of 100 passengers per trip, with 233 being their maximum occupancy and 53 the minimum. It should be noted that throughout December 2008 the MV Grigoriy Mikheev operated while based at 25 de Mayo (King George/ Rey Jorge) Island. Tourists flew in from Punta Arenas to Frei Station where they were transferred to the MV Mikheev.  For this the vessel set sail from Ushuaia to Antarctica on November 22nd 2008 and returned on January 3rd 2009. The rest of the season the MV Mikheev operated to and from Ushuaia.

It was also noted that expedition staff (expedition leaders, guides and lecturers) are not always clearly identified in the forms presented to the Argentine authorities. On occassions, they are included as “crew” and on other occassions as “passengers”. In the latter category, some vessels distinguished between “true” passengers and “staff” passengers, while others do not identify between the two (see table 4). These facts become relevant when we attempt an overview of the minimum guide-visitors ratio agreed to in Resolution Nº 4 (2007).

Based on the crew lists provided by the vessels to the Argentine authorities, it was noted that the presence of an ice master is not always indicated. Only 5 vessels have declared having an ice master as part of the crew. Two of them for a single trip and the remaining three for the whole season. 
Finally, Table 5 shows an overview of Antarctic vessels operating from Ushuaia during 2008/09, with an indication of their owner, register, tour operator and legal address. These vessels are registered in different countries, four of which are parties of the Antarctic Treaty (France, Netherlands, Norway and Russia) while the other eight countries or territories are not (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Cook Is, Liberia, Malta and Panama). 
Additionally, during 2008/09 thirty tour operators organized Antarctic activities passing through Ushuaia. Twenty six of them have legal addresses in countries which are Parties to the Antarctic Treaty (Germany, Argentina, Australia, Chile, United States, France, Netherlands, Japan, Norway and United Kingdom) while four of them have them in a country which is a Non Consultative Party (Canada).
