Japan’s Contribution to IPY 2007–2008

1. Introduction
Japan participated actively in International Polar Year 2007–2008, which successfully completed on 1 March 2009. It should be stressed, however, that polar research was not terminated on that date; only the intensive field research campaign came to an end. Analyses of the specimens and data collected during the period are now underway, while many research projects are being carried out further beyond the end date as the IPY’s legacy, and many of them are extensive projects. Hence this Information Paper serves as a preliminary report on Japan’s contribution to IPY 2007–2008.
In response to the call of the ICSU and the WMO, Japanese scientists decided to join IPY 2007–2008. The National IPY Committee was established within the Science Council of Japan, which organized, promoted, and supported research plans proposed by polar scientists in universities and institutes in Japan prior to and during the IPY period.

2. Selected research programs of IPY 2007–2008 carried out by Japanese scientists
2.1 General
The Japanese Antarctic station, Syowa (69°00' S, 39°35' E), was established on 29 January 1957 on the occasion of IGY. Since that time, research has been carried out continuously at and around the station to an ever-increasing extent, as with the Antarctic stations of other countries. This is indeed a grand legacy of IGY. The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) is numbered for each year, although research has been conducted continuously. 
The recent one, JARE49, was dispatched in 2007–2008, i.e. in the middle of IPY 2007–2008, and has reported its austral summer activity. At Syowa Station, a small balloon-borne cryogenic sampler experiment was carried out. Air samples from 25 km in altitude were recovered successfully. In the field around the station, unmanned magnetometer network observation and ecological research on Antarctic lakes were the major scientific programs.
 
2.2 Japanese-Swedish Antarctic Expedition traverse
Japanese Antarctic research activities are not restricted to the vicinity of Syowa. Large-scale field observation on the continent was often done in the form of international collaboration. The Japanese-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (JASE) is one of the joint contributions to the IPY 2007–2008 carried out in this manner. The tracked-vehicle-based expedition made use of two start points, Japan’s Syowa Station and Sweden’s Wasa Station. The JASE team investigated the inland environment of the ice sheet along the track connecting four Antarctic stations, Syowa–Dome Fuji–Köhnen–Wasa. The expedition started in November 2007, aiming for a meeting point (75° 53' S, 25° 50' E, 3661 m a.s.l.) on the polar plateau in late December for joint scientific efforts and the exchange of two crew members (Figure 1). The total length of the traverse track was more than 2,800 km, and the JASE traverse was conducted successfully.

2.3 Microbiological and Ecological Responses to Global Environmental Changes in Polar Regions (MERGE) program
A biological research project, the Microbiological and Ecological Responses to Global Environmental Changes in Polar Regions (MERGE), set a milestone in Japanese polar research history. It is the first international bipolar research project in which a Japanese scientist is taking on the role of principal investigator.
MERGE is endorsed as an IPY 2007–2008 core coordinating activity to integrate 11 original and several later proposals. Japan has taken on major leadership of MERGE, with particular reference to biodiversity and bioprospecting.
Under the MERGE umbrella, Belgium, Canada, and Spain have developed their own national/international projects. The Belgian Antarctic Microbial Biodiversity (AMBIO) project was carried out based at the newly constructed Belgian station in Antarctica. MERGE-Canada is a powerful component in understanding lake ecosystems in the Canadian high Arctic for comparison with similar systems in Antarctic areas. The Spanish LIMNOPOLAR project conducted a campaign called the IPY at Byers Peninsula (ASPA 126) in the 2008–2009 season, and invited international scientists (Figure 2).
MERGE will continue to serve as a coordinating platform for post-IPY 2007–2008 activities, and will develop closer and greater contributions to the SCAR program called Evolution and Biodiversity in Antarctica (EBA): The Response of Life to Change.

3. Outreach programs
Japan also made certain efforts in education-outreach activities. The Polar Open Forum for Junior High and High School Students was started in 2004 as part of IPY 2007–2008 as an outreach program by the Science Council of Japan and the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) to broaden interest in polar sciences among the next generation. The catchphrase of the forum is “Arctic and Antarctic Proposals from School Students.” The forum had been held annually. In 2008, the 5th Polar Open Forum called for research or logistic proposals for the Arctic or Antarctic from junior high and high school students aged 12 to 18 from all over Japan, and honored groups of students and their winning proposals on 14 December 2008. The award-winning proposals include producing freeze-dried tofu utilizing the cold and dry Antarctic climate in situ. Implementation of the proposal is to be carried out by the 50th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE-50) now overwintering at Syowa. The results of the experiments will be reported to the students through an Intelsat TV conference system from Syowa, Antarctica, while the expedition members enjoy a special dish cooked with the tofu product resulting from the experiment.
This five-year outreach campaign, stemming from IPY 2007–2008, is under review at the NIPR, and this kind of activity for the younger generation is under consideration to be continued as a legacy of the IPY as one of the key roles of the NIPR in the recruitment of polar scientists.

An outreach event titled the IPY Junior Summit was held at the National Science Museum in Tokyo on 1 March 2009 (Figure 3), until which time the IPY 2007–2008 campaign continued. Students who had won prizes in the first to fifth forums described above were invited to give a talk on the theme “Polar Research in 2057–2058,” i.e. during the period when the next IPY will be held. More than 100 audience members, mostly quite young as well, listened to their talks, which included interesting proposals for future polar research. A panel discussion followed the theme talks. The entire house, including the audience, joined in the discussion. A retired professor who was a member of the IGY research team and who overwintered at Syowa in 1957 was invited as a guest panelist. He introduced the legendary early years of JARE, stretching the time span from 50 years ago for 100 years.
