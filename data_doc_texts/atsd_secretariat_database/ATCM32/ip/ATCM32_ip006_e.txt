Report Submitted to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXXII by the Depositary Government for the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in Accordance with Recommendation XIII-2, Paragraph 2(D)
Submitted by the United Kingdom

This report covers events regarding the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) for the reporting year 1 March 2007 to 29 February 2008.  
The summary at Annex A lists all capturing and killing of Antarctic seals by Contracting Parties to CCAS during the reporting period.  A report of events in the 2008 – 2009 year will be submitted to ATCM XXXIII, once the June 2009 deadline for exchange of information has passed. 
The United Kingdom would like to remind Contracting Parties to CCAS that the reporting period for the Exchange of Information is from 1 March to the end of February each year. The reporting period was changed to the above dates during the September 1988 Meeting to Review the Operation of the Convention. This is documented in Paragraph 19(a) of the Report of that Meeting. 
The Exchange of Information, referred to in Paragraph 6(a) in the Annex to the Convention, should be submitted to other Contracting Parties and to SCAR by 30 June each year, including nil returns. The UK would like to thank all Contracting Parties to CCAS for providing this information in time to enable the UK to submit a complete report to ATCM XXXII. The UK would, however, continue to encourage all Contracting Parties to CCAS to submit returns on time to ensure that all relevant information has been provided.  
Since ATCM XXIII there have been no accessions to CCAS. A list of countries which were original signatories to the Convention, and countries which have subsequently acceded is attached to this report (Annex B).
