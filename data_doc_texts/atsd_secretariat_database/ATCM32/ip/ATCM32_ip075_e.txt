Central and Southeastern Europe cooperation in Polar Research




Central and Southeastern Europe cooperation in Polar Research

Regional Action Plan of polar research cooperation elaborated by Romania within the Europolar ERA-NET Program is a new approach of collaboration between the states in Central and Southeastern Europe.
Goal
Avoiding parallel efforts for improving the interdisciplinary studies that could be carried out between Arctic and Antarctic scientific communities in South East and Central Europe.   

Regional Action Plan involves a strategic plan (priorities and requirements) for a common Scientific Polar Program and includes: 
    • elaboration of common projects 
    • research trainings in polar zones for students and post-graduates 
    • logistic support by common utilization of existing Arctic and Antarctic facilities.

Considering the continuous increase of Polar zones importance for scientific research, especially for global environment, the necessity for scientific activities to have a minimum impact on the environment and on the dependent and associated ecosystems, a possible action plan also includes:
    • Common actions for a better utilization of cooperation possibilities, optimization of human resources and corresponding equipment in respect to the individual interests and putting into practice the Antarctic Treaty provisions and the European spirit 
Cooperation mechanisms
Action Plan provide the establishment of the most adequate mechanisms for cooperation and information exchange, that are necessary between polar institutions in these countries, benefiting of a specialized group of researchers, managers and technicians. 
Logistic  support
    • in conformity with the respective national capacities.
Romanian cooperation in polar research



Romania, besides its own polar research activities, cooperated since 1990 in the Arctic and Antarctica with some Central, Southeastern and Northern EU countries, as well as with Australia, Canada, China, Russian Federation, and Uruguay, both in polar expeditions and in scientific research programs. 

Romania already applies the concept of this Action Plan by initiating and organizing of:

♦ International symposia of scientific research, such as those in Bucharest, Romania  in 2006, 2007, 2008, where the following countries participated:  
        ◦ Austria, Bulgaria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Sweden, UK and, indirectly, Australia, China, Israel.
	An important information exchange and workshop activity was the Third International Symposium of Polar Research held in June 2008 in Bucharest, Romanian Academy, when the ESF Polar CLIMATE Call for Pre-proposals was presented and some of the participants described their pre-proposal themes and objectives. 

     ♦  Research networking
	Excellence research projects of networking 2006-2008, within the national competition, involving 9 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Israel, Romania, Sweden, USA, under the project titles:			
        ◦ Structuring of an integrated international cooperation research on biodiversity in polar ecosystems, the response to environmental changes, and applications  - coordinated by Romanian Polar Research Institute 
        ◦ Promotion of international cooperation research for the study of psychrophile microorganism potential in bioremediation - coordinated by Romanian Polar Research Institute 
        ◦ Promotion within an European and international partnership of biomedical research under extreme life conditions.
   
♦ Field work and training activities

♦ Collaboration between Southeast- and North-European countries: 
        ◦ Romanian Greenland Expedition 2008 (Romania and Denmark)
        ◦ Romanian Spitsbergen Expedition 2008 (Norway and Romania) 
        ◦ Romanian Antarctic Expedition 2008-2009, Law-Racovita Station, Larsemann Hills, with support of Indian Antarctic Expedition (Austria, Estonia, India and Romania)     
        ◦ Training for Romanian Ph.D students in Denmark, Copenhagen University, Microbiology and Genetics Department 2008 and 2009
        ◦ Antarctic International Expedition at Law-Racovita Station, 2009, involving specialists from Estonia, India, Australia, organized by Romanian Antarctic foundation with support of the Indian Expedition 2009. 

♦ Activities within Europolar Consortium
