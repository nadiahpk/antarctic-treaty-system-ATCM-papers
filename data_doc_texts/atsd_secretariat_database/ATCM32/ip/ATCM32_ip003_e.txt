Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the Thirty-Second Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
Introduction

    1. The Twenty-Seventh Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)1 was held in Hobart from 27 October to 5 November 2008. A number of routine matters were addressed along with notable specific issues, including:

    • CCAMLR fisheries in 2007/08;
    • Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing;
    • Ecosystem monitoring and management ;
    • Deep-sea bottom fishing;
    • By-catch in longline and trawl fisheries;
    • Marine Protected Areas;
    • Co-operation with international organizations, particularly the ATCM, and
    • Performance review of the organisation.

    2. CCAMLR’s deliberations on the issues identified in paragraph (1), and others, are summarised below. Emphasis is given to items that are particularly relevant to the ATCM XXXII and CEP XII agendas. An overall summary of important discussions and decisions from CCAMLR XXVII is provided in Appendix I along with references to the meeting’s report paragraphs. 
CCAMLR Fisheries in 2007/08
    3. Fisheries in the CAMLR Convention Area during 2007/08 (1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008) targeted Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and krill (Euphausia superba). The 2007/08 catches reported to CCAMLR-XXVII were interim catches, and the revised amounts will be published in Volume 21 of the CCAMLR Statistical Bulletin (http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/intro.htm).
    4. Based on the data available at the time of writing, the reported catch of Dissostichus spp. in 2007/08 (to 30 November 2008) was 12573 tonnes, taken predominantly by longlining, compared to 16329 tonnes in the previous season (1 December 2006 to 30 November 2007).  It is estimated that, in addition to reported catches, some 1169 tonnes of Dissostichus spp. were taken as a result of IUU fishing in the Convention Area during 2007/08, compared with 3615 tonnes in 2006/07. The total global catch for Dissostichus spp. in 2007/08 was estimated at 24 033 tonnes at 1 October 2008, compared with 26 722 tonnes for the corresponding interval the previous season. For further discussion on IUU fishing, please refer to CCAMLR-XXVII, paragraphs 10.1 to 10.4 (paragraphs 11 to 13 below). 
    5. The reported krill catch in 2007/08 (to 30 November 2008) was 125 992 tonnes compared with 104 586 tonnes in the previous season. The reported catch in 2007/08 was well below the notified catch (i.e. the catch predicted on the basis of mandatory notifications of the intention to fish for krill in the forthcoming season) of 684 000 tonnes (CCAMLR-XXVI, paragraph 4.34). Annual catches of krill have generally remained in a relatively stable range (80 000 to 120 000 tonnes) since 1992/93 
    6. As in previous years, the discrepancy in reported and notified krill catches for 2007/08 remains a cause for concern (see paragraph 5 above). 
    7. The notified krill catches for 2008/09 were 629 000 tonnes - in excess of five times the current catch level. The catches notified for 2007/08 and 2008/09 are also higher than the catch trigger level above which there is a mandatory requirement to spatially subdivide the precautionary catch limits for krill in Area 48 CCAMLR Conservation Measure 51-01). 
    8. Once again, CCAMLR has noted that the krill fishery’s pattern of operation is changing and this emphasizes the need to obtain sufficient information from the current fishery to meet future management needs. This is vital should the fishery increase and/or become concentrated in any particular region or subarea, including small-scale management units (SSMUs). To this effect the Commission is focusing on orderly development of the krill fishery, improvement of the krill fishery notification system, systematic scientific observer coverage and ensuring that the catch trigger level in Area 48 is not exceeded until a method to sub-divide allowable catches is developed and implemented.
    9. The Commission adopted conservation measures (CMs) for all fisheries to be conducted in the 2008/09 season, as well as general measures for regulating fishing activities and reporting fisheries information from the Convention Area.  The most notable new CMs provide for notification of transhipments (CM 10-09) and improving management of bottom fishing to protect benthic communities in the CAMLR Convention Area, along with elaboration of procedures to identify VMEs (Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems) (CM 22-07) and close areas to fishing where these are detected. All measures are published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2008/09 available from the CCAMLR Secretariat or the website: http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cm/08-09/toc.htm.
    10. In addition to the Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Dissostichus spp. and CMs to manage specific fisheries directly (e.g. the setting of catch limits and other conditions affecting fishing), other CCAMLR measures include:
    • The CCAMLR System of Inspection;
    • Interim prohibition on deep-sea gillnetting and restrictions on use of bottom trawling gear;
    • Prohibition of longline fishing in waters shallower than 550m;
    • General environmental protection during fishing;
    • Scheme to Promote Compliance by both Contracting and Non-Contracting Party Vessels, including provisions for compiling a list of IUU vessels;
    • Licensing and Inspection Obligations of Contracting Parties with regard to their Flag Vessels Operating in the Convention Area;
    • Promoting compliance with CCAMLR CMs by Contracting Party nationals
    • Procedures for port inspections of vessels carrying Toothfish;
    • Marking of Fishing Vessels and Fishing Gear; 
    • Automated Satellite-Linked Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS); and
    • Various Resolutions – (a) “Banning Driftnet Fishing in the Convention Area”, (b) “Harvesting Species Occurring Both within and Outside the Convention Area”, (c) “Implementation of the CDS by Acceding States and Non-Contracting Parties”, (d) “Use of Ports not Implementing the CDS”, (e) “Application of VMS in the CDS”, (f) “Use of VMS and Other Measures to Verify CDS Catch Data for Areas Outside the Convention Area, Especially FAO Statistical Area 51”; (g) “Harvesting of D. eleginoides in Areas Outside Coastal State Jurisdiction Adjacent to the Convention Area in FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57”, (h) “Vessels Flying Flags of Non-Compliance”, (i) “Ice Strengthening Standards in High Latitude Fisheries”, (j) a “Non-Contracting Party Co-Operation Programme”, (k) “International actions to reduce the incidental mortality of seabirds arising from fishing”, (l) “Tariff Classification for Krill”, and (m) “Ballast Water Exchange in the Convention Area”.
Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Fishing 
    11. IUU fishing for Dissostichus spp. in the Convention Area has been a major issue for the Commission since 1997. CCAMLR affords high priority to eliminating such fishing and implements an integrated suite of administrative, political and enforcement-related measures to address the problem consistent with international best practice. 
    12. CCAMLR’s efforts to combat IUU fishing continue to take place against a background of ongoing and vigorous action by individual CCAMLR Contracting Parties in areas under their national jurisdiction.  
    13.  CCAMLR has requested its Members to increase surveillance in the Convention Area, particularly in Indian Ocean Statistical Divisions 58.4.1, 58.4.2 and 58.4.3b. 
    14. To facilitate exchange of relevant information amongst its Members, CCAMLR maintains a database on vessels known to have fished in contravention of CCAMLR Conservation Measures. Such vessels are incorporated annually into an official “CCAMLR IUU Vessel List” which can be found at http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/sc/fish-monit/iuu-vess.htm along with a list of vessels licensed by CCAMLR Members to fish in CCAMLR waters (http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/sc/fish-monit/vess-licensed.htm). CCAMLR uses a centralized, satellite-based vessel monitoring system (c-VMS) to monitor the movements of fishing vessels in the Convention Area. This system greatly facilitates surveillance of licensed vessels.
    15. CCAMLR continues to interact with other international and regional fisheries organisations, especially those with responsibility for waters adjacent to the Convention Area. Such interaction includes the exchange of information on issues such as IUU fishing, seabird incidental mortality and other matters relevant to CCAMLR. In this regard, CCAMLR has entered into a co-operation arrangement with the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).
Ecosystem Monitoring and Management
    16. The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP) collects long-term data on various Antarctic marine ecosystem components as well as the environment. These data are used to provide annual assessments of ecosystem status.
    17. The Commission follows scientific advice in estimating krill precautionary catch levels and on other ecosystem-related factors to be used in applying the conservation principles set out in Article II of the Convention.
    18. The CCAMLR scientific community is exploring ways in which ecosystem advice can be formally incorporated into management decisions. In this respect, the Commission has afforded high priority to:
    • On-going development of management procedures to allocate the precautionary krill catch limit in the Southwest Atlantic (Area 48) to SSMUs;
    • Implementation of a systematic scientific approach to avoiding and mitigating significant adverse impacts on VMEs arising from fishing activities (paragraph 9 above);
    • Further development of ecosystem models to take into account the complex interactions between predators, target species and fisheries other than the krill fishery (following a workshop in June 2008 to provide abundance estimates of land-based predators and a joint workshop with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in August 2008 to consider Antarctic ecosystem model inputs), and
    • The Scientific Committee considering how to address the issue of climate change in relation to conservation of Antarctic marine living resources within its agenda.
It should be stressed that progress on the VME issue forthcoming from CCAMLR-XXVII is both unprecedented and sets CCAMLR apart from, and in advance of, such progress elsewhere in respect to the 31 December 2008 deadline imposed by UNGA Resolution 61/105.
    19. CCAMLR continues to monitor marine debris washed up on beaches, the entanglement of marine mammals and marine debris associated with seabird colonies in the Convention Area.  
By-Catch in Longline and Trawl Fisheries
    20. CCAMLR continues to leads the world in implementing measures to reduce seabird mortality during longline fishing. Many CCAMLR measures, particularly the provisions of Conservation Measure 25-03 (first adopted in 1992), have been incorporated into the FAO International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds) adopted by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI). A number of CCAMLR Members have developed and implemented national plans of action to address seabird by-catch issues. Such initiatives have thus resulted in the development of close ties between CCAMLR and ACAP (Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels).
    21. Compliance with CCAMLR seabird by-catch mitigation measures has improved to the extent that incidental catch levels in regulated fisheries in the Convention Area are extremely low or near zero in areas where best practice has been applied. However, the levels attributable to IUU fishing remain a cause for concern. In addition, many bird species breeding in the Convention Area (particularly albatrosses and petrels) remain affected by high levels of mortality associated with longline fishing in waters outside the Convention Area.  
    22. CCAMLR Resolution 22/XXIII remains as an important initiative in efforts to reduce incidental mortality of Convention Area seabirds in adjacent areas. 
    23. CCAMLR continues to exchange information with other international fisheries and conservation organizations (most notably ACAP) on the prevention of fisheries-induced seabird by-catch and the state of Antarctic seabird populations. This includes exchanging information on CCAMLR’s experience with mitigation and associated conservation action. In particular, CCAMLR seeks advice from other regional fisheries bodies (particularly those managing tuna, such as ICCAT, IOTC, CCSBT and WCPFC) in an effort to secure global information on incidental by-catch of seabird species breeding in the Convention Area. It should be noted that, unlike CCAMLR, many of these organizations do not mandate the collection of seabird by-catch data.
    24. CCAMLR also monitors the by-catch of marine mammals in both trawl and longline fisheries and remains concerned with the need to monitor fish by-catch in directed fisheries, particularly in respect of improving current knowledge and setting ecologically sustainable catch limits for the species being impacted. Various CCAMLR CMs have been agreed, and were updated, to address incidental mortality mitigation and other fisheries by-catch issues. These are contained in the Schedule of CCAMLR Conservation Measures 2008/09 at http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/cm/08-09/toc.htm). 
Protected Areas (Including Marine Protected [MPAS])
    25. CCAMLR implements streamlined administrative procedures introduced by the CCAMLR Secretariat in 2007 to ensure that ATCM proposals for protected areas with marine components are speedily reviewed by CCAMLR following ATCM Decision 9 (2005). 
    26. The CCAMLR Scientific Committee is progressing implementation of spatial management measures to facilitate marine biodiversity conservation (SC-CAMLR-XXVII, Annex 4, paragraphs 3.1 to 3.78). It also continues to discuss MPAs as a key item of business (SC-CAMLR-XXVII, paragraph 3.55) in the development of a clear process for developing such areas concurrent with an ongoing scientific process to identify where they should be located.
    27. In the above respect, it is worth noting that previous discussions by CCAMLR and the CEP have concluded that a system of marine areas for biodiversity conservation in the Southern Ocean should be addressed as a matter of priority (CCAMLR XXIII, paragraph 4.13; CEP-IX, paragraph 94 to 101). CCAMLR has noted that benthic and pelagic bioregionalisations developed by the 2007 CCAMLR Bioregionalisation Workshop is adequate for this work and used the Workshop outcomes to identify suitable areas for consideration as candidate MPAs. 

CCAMLR Performance Review
    28. Since 1996, CCAMLR has formally addressed implementation of the Convention’s objectives on its agenda. A symposium, co-sponsored by Australia and Chile, in 2005 to discuss CCAMLR’s future was a major development in this regard. A number of general and specific initiatives were proposed with a view to improving CCAMLR’s effectiveness and operational efficiency.
    29. In 2008, following developments at COFI-27 and in UNGA Resolution 61/105, CCAMLR-XXVI agreed to undertake a review of the institution’s performance. The terms of reference, work plan, performance criteria for the review and its report are accessible at:  http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/00-Prfrm-Review-for-public-webpage.pdf . The Commission’s deliberations on the CCAMLR Performance Review may be found in CCAMLR-XXVII, paragraphs 17.1 to 17.18.
    30. The following items are likely to be of particular interest to the ATCM:
    • The Commission appreciated that the Scientific Committee has requested its incoming Chair to form a Steering Committee to develop a ‘roadmap’ (plan of action) to tackle the Review Panel’s recommendation during the 2008/09 intersessional period;
    • CCAMLR is the first organisation of its type to undertake and respond to such a Performance Review in the context of the Convention’s objectives relating to both the conservation and rational utilisation of marine living resources, and
    • The Commission generally endorsed the Performance Review Panel’s view (CCAMLR-XXVII/8, Chapter 2.1) on the relationship between CCAMLR and the Antarctic Treaty.  It noted in particular the need to reinforce the obligation set out in Articles III, V (and IV.1) of the Convention. The Commission also noted that implementing these recommendations into Commission decisions would require formal presentation of detailed proposals by Members. 
	In respect to the third point above, Australia as the CAMLR Convention Depository will develop text to address the CCAMLR Review Panel recommendation (paragraph 2.1.1a) on ‘the need to bring to the attention of an Acceding State, or a State seeking accession, to the CCAMLR Convention the particular Convention articles linking the Convention with the Antarctic Treaty’(CCAMLR-XXVII, paragraph 17.14).  The CCAMLR Secretariat will also prepare an information pack on CCAMLR and its links to the Antarctic Treaty to be made available to Acceding States, and other States indicating an interest in CCAMLR.  
Co-Operation with Non-Contracting Parties
    31. To implement its CDS, CCAMLR has worked closely with various Non-Contracting Parties (NCPs) considered to have an interest in CCAMLR’s work, or in the resources that the latter manages. This has included inviting NCPs to attend and participate in CCAMLR meetings. CCAMLR is also actively engaged in improving dialogue with NCPs to address their potential involvement in IUU fishing undermining CCAMLR CMs. This is achieved through CCAMLR’s Policy to Enhance Cooperation between CCAMLR and Non-Contracting Parties aimed at improving the effectiveness of CCAMLR-NCP cooperation. The Policy includes a cooperation enhancement program.	  

Co-Operation with Other International Organizations
    32. CCAMLR continues to urge its Members to accept and ratify a number of relevant international agreements, such as ACAP. It also co-operates closely with various RFMOs (CCSBT, IATTC, ICCAT, IOTC, IWC, NAFO, NEAFC, SEAFO and WCPFC) to further its work and co-ordinate its conservation efforts (particularly in relation to combating both IUU fishing and seabird by-catch during longlining). CCAMLR encourages its Members to cooperate in a comprehensive and integrated international approach to such problems.
    33. FAO is a key international organization explicitly referred to in CAMLR Convention Article XXIII as being one with which CCAMLR should cooperate.  Both the Commission and Scientific Committee enjoy a productive cooperative working relationship with FAO in general and with several FAO-sponsored activities such as the work of the Coordinating Working Party on Fisheries Statistics (CWP), the Sub-Committee on Fish Trade, the Regional Fisheries Bodies Secretariat Network and the  Fisheries Resources Monitoring System (FIRMS) in particular. 
    34. CCAMLR stands as the leading example of global best practice in addressing marine fisheries conservation issues. 
Co-Operation with the ATCM
    35. CCAMLR-XXVII again expressed satisfaction with the growing co-operation between CCAMLR and the ATCM/CEP, noting that the Chair of the CEP had served as a member of the CCAMLR Performance Review Panel.	
    36. While there were no decisions or resolutions of direct relevance to CCAMLR-XXVII arising from CEP-XI or ATCM-XXXI, CCAMLR noted that:
    • Considerable interest was expressed by the CEP in the outcomes of the CCAMLR Performance Review;
    • A presentation on the work of CCAMLR given to CEP-XI had been well received; 
    • Scientific Committee deliberations on a Joint CEP-SC‑CAMLR Workshop had provided draft Terms of Reference (SC-CAMLR-XXVII, paragraphs 9.9 to 9.17) and a work plan for a Workshop Steering Committee. The Commission agreed that the Workshop will be held in early April 2009, immediately prior to CEP XII in Baltimore, USA (SC-CAMLR-XXVI, paragraph 6.18);
    • CCAMLR Resolution 28/XXVII (see paragraph 10 above) will extend application of IMO Resolution MEPC.163(56) to the entire CAMLR Convention Area (CCAMLR-XXVII, paragraphs 13.65 to 13.66 and 15.14), and 
    • The CCAMLR Science Officer will accompany the new Chair of the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to the CEP in order to improve institutional continuity between the CEP and CCAMLR.
