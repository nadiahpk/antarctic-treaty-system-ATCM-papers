Impacts of local human activities on the Antarctic environment: A review
I. 	Introduction
This information paper presents a summary of the review article of the same title published in the journal Antarctic Science in January 2009, co-authored by nine experts in terrestrial and marine biology and contaminated site assessment and remediation1.
The purpose of this summary is to:
- summarise recent research on human impacts on the southern polar environment, and
- recommend how research can be better fed back into the current environmental management regimes (primarily the Environmental Protocol and CCAMLR) to inform decisions. 
Ten years after the entry into force of the Environmental Protocol, and in view of the continuing expansion in intensity and diversity of human activities in Antarctica, it is timely to provide a review of the state of knowledge of human impacts and their management in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean2. Such a compilation and assessment of information can provide an objective baseline against which future changes can be measured. This will inform ongoing debates, both in public fora and within the Antarctic Treaty System, on the future direction, mechanisms and implementation of environmental management and enhance the importance of stewardship in Antarctica. 
II. 	Findings
A. Chemical contamination
Chemical contamination is the most widespread environmental impact of human activities in Antarctica and contamination from land-based operations typically extends for hundreds of metres with a highly variable flux depending on season. Sources of contamination are from energy generation and fuel spills. There is no comprehensive inventory of contamination in Antarctica, although the amount of contaminated soil and waste has been estimated to be of the order 1–10 million m3. Antarctic chemical contamination may be limited in its absolute areal extent, but the significance of its impact is magnified as it affects a large proportion of the ice-free area in Antarctica - an extremely limited habitat. Apart from fuel spills that occur in high-energy marine environments, where dispersal is rapid, research findings show that chemical contamination is long-lived in Antarctica. Natural attenuation rates are very slow, and there is mounting evidence that individuals and biological communities are more sensitive to contamination in cold regions. A range of remediation techniques has recently been investigated, including multistage water treatment systems, permeable reactive barriers, and bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Antarctica lags far behind other global regions regarding the existence of environmentally-relevant data for risk-based decision making.    
B. Sewage contamination
Contemporary sewage management practices at many coastal stations are insufficient to prevent local contamination. While contamination has been found to be generally localised around sewage outfalls, studies show that even comparatively low volumes of sewage could affect the near-shore marine environment. Impacted sites generally have lower species richness, biodiversity and variability in benthic invertebrate communities compared with control sites.  Comparatively little work has been done on the effects of sewage on other biological groups. Experiments suggest that sewage contamination could lead to genotoxic effects and pathological anomalies in Antarctic fish but the levels of heavy metals found in sewage may have little direct effect. Since the entry into force of the Environmental Protocol, the level of sewage treatment applied at stations varies considerably. Many countries do no more than is required of them by the Environmental Protocol whereas others have taken the decision to treat their sewage to levels that exceed their own national standards. The long-term potential impact of sewage is not known largely because it has not been systematically investigated. 
C. Disturbance to flora and fauna
Human activities, particularly construction and transport, have affected Antarctic flora and fauna. Very few scientific reports have described the effects of human disturbance to Antarctic terrestrial vegetation. Disturbance to terrestrial ecosystems by people has been important where station infrastructure and vegetation are located in the same vicinity. Where there is a high concentration of stations established by many different nations, for example, on Fildes Peninsula on King George Island, there are many areas of damaged vegetation. Trampling has a considerable impact on plant species and soils in the sub-Antarctic. Evidence indicates that Antarctic vegetation and soils show vulnerability to even low levels of disturbance. 
Varying degrees of disturbance on Antarctic wildlife have resulted from human approach, handling, construction of infrastructure, noise and visual intrusion from aircraft operations, underwater anthropogenic noise and lights on ships. At some locations and for certain species, the disturbance associated with general human activities has little apparent effect on population trends, while, at other sites and for some species, human activities have been implicated in population declines. Whether visitor impacts lead to reduced recruitment and population abundances of seabirds over longer time scales is difficult to judge because habituation may occur. 
D. Introduction of non-indigenous species
A small number of non-indigenous plant and animal species has become established, mostly in the sub- and maritime Antarctic regions of the southern archipelagos of the Scotia Arc and the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The sub-Antarctic provides a clear warning of the consequences of establishment of invasive non-indigenous species within the Antarctic continent, which is expected to increase in likelihood under climate change. Although very few non-indigenous species are yet established on the continent, it is clear that many analogous transfers of biota do occur, with the major vectors including cargo, vehicles, food, clothing and people, and that the frequency of these far outweighs natural dispersal events. Risks of establishment of non-indigenous species come both from transfer of species from outside Antarctica and also from transfer of species within Antarctica between different biogeographical regions. The potential for introduction of alien marine taxa to the Antarctic region, via the hulls of visiting vessels, ballast water, and marine debris, has also been recognised recently.
E. Exploitation of marine living resources
Exploitation of fur seals, penguins, whales and finfish in the Southern Ocean have followed the stages of exploration, exploitation, over-exploitation, followed by management. Over-exploitation led to the severe depression or local extinction in some localities of some populations. Following the initiation of management by SCAR, IWC and CCAMLR, a few species, such as fur seals and minke whales, have recovered; other cetaceans are beginning to recover, while there is no evidence of recovery in overexploited fish. Significant incidental mortality of seabirds, e.g., albatrosses and petrels, as a result of longline fishing operations became evident in the 1990s. Since the introduction of certain mitigation measures, seabird bycatch from legal fisheries in CCAMLR managed waters has become essentially negligible. However, numbers of bird deaths remain high as a result of significant Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing activities for toothfish. IUU fishing likely exceeds the levels of permitted fishing over wide areas and forms a significant portion of the total global catch of toothfish. The impacts of two centuries of exploitation of marine living resources on the Antarctic marine ecosystems are poorly understood and could potentially be far-reaching.
III.	Recommendations
A. Initiate long-term monitoring programmes
Environmental monitoring is seen as integral to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process under Annex I of the Environmental Protocol, and is considered as an important activity within the Protocol for assessing, understanding and managing human impacts in Antarctica.  However, this effort, which is crucial to the verification of predicted impacts and the early detection of unforeseen effects of activities, has been under-deployed. 
* Chemical contamination: Assess the nature (e.g. type) of the contamination, its distribution, environmental impact (e.g. soil heath, marine community disturbance), and longevity. Monitor remediation efforts and recovery. 
* Sewage: Monitoring essential for informing future decisions on appropriate types and degrees of sewage treatment, design and siting of outfalls, and likely impacts of sewage disposal on Antarctic wildlife. 
* Flora: Studies of vegetation communities around Antarctic stations needed to provide baseline data from which to detect future changes. 
* Fauna: Studies necessary for detecting any possible cumulative impacts of ship-based tourism and to provide information in detecting and managing potentially harmful human impacts on wildlife. 
* Non-indigenous species: Monitoring needed to identify new instances of introduction, monitor the status of species already established and assess the effectiveness of any mitigation measures adopted. 
* Fisheries: Monitoring (that complements existing programs on krill) essential to provide information on ecosystem effects of finfish fishing and whaling to inform decisions on catch limits. 
B. Mitigate known highest risks
    • Put in place strong measures to prevent the establishment of invasive species
Through the relatively limited number (in absolute terms) of access routes, vessels and journeys to Antarctica, it is amongst the most practicable of continents on which to apply control measures to minimise this risk, in order to maintain its unique terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Possible measures include stringent procedures to ensure rodent-free status of ships and aircraft, logistical planning to minimise the risk of intra-regional and local transfer of propagules to pristine locations, control of visitor numbers and access to more sensitive or pristine sites, and cleaning/sterilisation of high risk transport locations for aliens, such as cargo surfaces, foodstuffs and clothing (important in both inter- and intra-regional contexts).
 
    • Develop universally accepted standards for the remediation of contaminated sites. 
Annex III of the Protocol states that past and present waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities shall be cleaned up by the generator(s) of such wastes and the user(s) of such sites. However, in the 10 years since the Environmental Protocol, there is still a reluctance to take ownership of the contaminated sites issue in some quarters. There is a need for universally accepted clean-up standards that provide clarity on remediation requirements. These standards need to be developed using sound environment-specific science. They need to provide guidance on: to what level sites should be cleaned-up, what type of monitoring is required to demonstrate that any activity does not result in adverse environmental impacts, etc.
C. Strengthen regulations
    • The effectiveness of EIA provisions needs to be assessed and verified.
The effectiveness and credibility of the EIA process has a significant bearing on the magnitude and extent of the environmental impacts that are the subject of the present review. Current research on human impacts rarely provides the information required to assess and verify environmental impacts predicted in EIAs. Consequently no data can be fed back to assess the effectiveness of EIA provisions. As the sole gate keeper of whether an activity can or cannot go ahead in Antarctica, the EIA process needs to be informed and tuned by more robust checks and balances, especially in view of the expansion of both national and commercial activities.

    • Apply the precautionary approach. 
While there will always be an imperative for additional science and information on which to base decisions, uncertainty is a basic and largely unavoidable aspect of environmental management in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean. Many studies have advocated for the application of the precautionary approach with regard to the management and regulation of tourist number and proximity to colonies of wildlife. CCAMLR has developed what are thought to be precautionary approaches to setting catch limits. Other practical applications of the precautionary approach that should also be more widely considered include: adopting restrictions on the permissible types of activities, establishing temporal or spatial limitations for certain sites, and improving the assessment of cumulative impacts.  

The environmental management regimes of the Antarctic Treaty System have often been lauded as being innovative and forward-looking, setting the example for other parts of the world. In the 21st century, it is necessary for these regimes to continue to evolve and deliver bold and forward-looking solutions to the new environmental challenges facing the Antarctic region.
