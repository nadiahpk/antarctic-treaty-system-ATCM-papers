Launch of Postmarked Stamp Issue:
“Preserving the Polar Regions and Glaciers”

In March 2009, the postal services of Chile and Finland jointly issued a postage stamp with the title “Preserving the Polar Regions and Glaciers”. The issue was the initiative of the Chilean Ambassador to Finland, Carlos Parra, who formally put forward the idea following an official visit to Finland by H.E The President of the Republic of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, in May of 2007.
The stamp was launched simultaneously in the cities of Santiago and Helsinki on 18 March 2009 as a series of 50,000, representing the polar ice of the Arctic and Antarctic with red lines circling the poles to call attention to the threat to the survival of the icecaps.
The stamp issue reflects both countries’ concern about current worldwide environmental phenomena threatening the continued existence of the polar icecaps which make possible life on Earth as we know it. This initiative has been an extraordinary experience, bringing together in a philatelic venture for the first time countries representing the two poles.
In addition, this postage stamp serves as a way of conveying to the international community the sponsor governments’ concern over the issue of climate change and its effects on the polar regions. The severe contraction of the icecaps has become one of the major scientific, political and social challenges in the recent history of humankind.
