1. Introduction
At CEP VII, Germany introduced IP 005, “Research Project Risk assessment for the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island and the development of management plans for desig­nation as Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed Areas’”. This paper described the below mentioned German three-year research project (2003 – 2006) and introduced it for the first time. Several CEP members expressed their support for the proposal, and indicated that they would willingly assist Germany in the project.
At CEP VIII, Germany introduced IP 016, “Progress Report on the Research Project Risk assessment for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island and the development of management plans for designation as Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed Areas”. This paper provided an update of the project, noting the excellent co-operation with other Parties in the area through an informal co-ordination group. 
At ATCM XXVIII, “Germany agreed that prior to tabling a draft Management Plan for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island (King George Island) and following a proposal by Chile an International Working Group should be established. This Working Group should be composed of those Parties with stations and/or huts in the area, Parties with an interest in the area as well as Observers to the Antarctic Treaty. It should discuss the issues related to the Draft Management Plan. For this purpose, Germany would organize two international workshops, one in September 2005 and another one in January/February 2006, in order to convene the participants on this issue” (Final Report of ATCM XXVIII, para. 90).
At CEP IX, Brazil, China, Germany, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation introduced WP 022, “Possibilities for Environmental Management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island. Proposal to establish an Intersessional Contact Group”. This paper reported on the main findings and recommendations of the King George Island Work­shop “Possibilities for Environmental Management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island” in January/February 2006 as well as on the outcome of the Workshop “Human impact on terrestrial habitats in the Antarctic” in September 2005”. Discussion of this paper is reflected in paragraphs 70 to 75 of the CEP Report.
At ATCM XXIX, “Germany expressed satisfaction on reaching agreement with Chile in principle on developing an ASMA for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island. They will jointly convene – via note verbal – an international working group (paragraph 74 of the CEP Report). Germany expressed the hope that a substantive outcome of the group’s work would be presented to the next ATCM. Chile confirmed that it will host a work­shop to prepare the input on this issue for discussion at CEP X.” (Final Report of ATCM XXIX, para. 77).
Pursuant to these understandings an international working group involving government representatives of interested Parties was convened by Germany and Chile in order to discuss management approaches, possibly aiming at drafting a management plan for an ASMA covering the Fildes Peninsula Region (see separate IP 22 rev. 1 by Germany and Chile). 
At ATCM XXX, Germany introduced IP 112 “Possible Modules of a “Fildes Peninsula region” ASMA Management Plan”. Further, Germany and Chile introduced IP 22 rev. 1 “Progress Report on the Discussion of the International Working Group about Possibilities for Environmental Management of Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island”. Comments of 15 IWG parties to four questions concerning the future management of the Fildes Peninsula Region were reported.
At ATCM XXXI, Germany introduced IP 30 “Final Report on the Research Project “Risk assessment for Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island and the development of management plans for designation as Antarctic Specially Protected or Managed Areas“”. It contained a proposal for a “Fildes Peninsula region ASMA Management Plan” which was already presented to CEP X as IP 112 (2007) “Possible Modules of a ‘Fildes Peninsula region’ ASMA Management Plan” and which was up-loaded on the IWG web-based Discussion Forum. The final report is available at http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/uba-info-medien/mysql_medien.php?anfrage=Kennummer&Suchwort=3478.

2. The new Research Project
With the publication of the above mentioned report of the previous project (IP 30 ATCM XXXI) the environmental situation of the whole Fildes Peninsula region was comprehensively presented for the first time. A lot of environmental problems as well as conflicts of interests between research, logistics, tourism and environmental protection were pointed out. Furthermore, detailed proposals to face the identified challenges were developed. They are currently reflected in the work of an International Working Group (IWG Fildes) at the web-based Discussion Forum of the CEP. 
Not least in view of current environmental challenges like waste storage and large scale wind drifting of waste it turned out to be necessary to update the assessment of the environmental state of the Fildes Peninsula Region. Therefore, the research project “Current Environmental Situation and Management Proposals for the Fildes Region (Antarctic)” carried out by Hans-Ulrich Peter, Christina Braun and Anja Nordt (University of Jena, Germany) was initiated and commissioned by the German Federal Environment Agency. It started in November 2008 and will last for two years (see Annex).  
Aim of this project is the elaboration of an updated standardized assessment of fauna and flora of the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island with focus on birds and seals. The reaction of animals and plants on different forms of human impact as well as any considerable environmental changes compared to the results of the previous project (“Risk assessment for the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island, and development of management plans for their designation as specially protected or specially managed areas”) will be analyzed to keep the scientific data base up to date and usable during the process of discussion by the International Working Group at CEP. The Annex contains a detailed abstract of the studies’ working plan. 

3. Invitation for cooperation
Germany would highly appreciate the co-operation of other Antarctic Treaty Parties with respect to all issues of this project. This includes any comments, proposals and hints, especially from those Antarctic Treaty Parties operating stations and huts in the Fildes Region. 
Of special interest are contributions on: 
    • Information about current and future land use of station areas (e.g. map of station area including all buildings and facilities; planned constructions and extensions),
    • Information about current changes regarding operation of stations, e.g. stations’ waste management and sewage water treatment, 
    • Current traffic statistics (in particular air and ship/boat traffic), 
    • Ongoing and planned research on fossils (new results relevant for designation of protected areas), and 
    • Information about current or planned scientific research beyond station areas and giving names of contact persons on-site.

- Working Plan -


1. Introduction
The Fildes Region represents one of the largest ice-free areas in the maritime Antarctic. This region is characterized by a high biodiversity and accomodates five permanent research stations. Thus, scientific, logistic and tourist activities concentrate here and regularly overlap in space and time. This leads to a conflict of interest between different forms of utilisation of the region and the legally agreed environmental protection (Environmental Protocol).

With the research project “Risk assessment for the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island, and development of management plans for their designation as specially protected or specially managed areas” a valuable contribution was made for a possible designation as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA). Based on main results from field studies and from a comprehensive risk assessment a first draft of a management plan was prepared and presented for discussion at the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) of the Antarctic Treaty Parties. An International Working Group under German-Chilean leadership was assigned to discuss a management system for the different groups of interest in the Fildes Region.

2. Aim of the project
As the designation of an ASMA as well as the compilation of alternative management measures are a protracted process further consecutive research is required.

Aim of this project is to elaborate an updated standardized assessment of fauna and flora of the Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island with focus on birds and seals. The reaction of animals and plants on different forms of human impact as well as any considerable environmental changes compared to the results of the previous project will be analysed to keep the scientific data base up to date and usable during the process of discussion on international level (ATCM).

The project will be carried out by Hans-Ulrich Peter, Christina Braun and Anja Nordt (University of Jena, Germany) in close co-operation with scientists from other countries.

3. Description of the project
The terrestrial environmental situation of the Fildes Region will be studied in detail during two summer seasons from December to March in 2008/09 and in 2009/10 to create a scientific, GPS- and GIS-based description of the biotic and abiotic parameters of the region. It will also include a quantification of human activities and environmental impacts in the Fildes Region.
The field work will be carried out as follows:

a)	Assessment of main changes of the environmental situation in the study area (compared to the results of the previous study, Peter et. al 2008)
    • Changes of current and historical waste deposits and documentation of the stations’ current waste management 
    • Discharge of organic material: sewage discharge, handling of organic waste, availability of organic waste to birds, active feeding of birds 
    • Oil contamination of soils and water bodies
    • Noise sources
    • Major construction activities and possible impact on the environment
    • Changes of land consumption by research stations
    • Main changes regarding air, sea and land traffic 
    • Use of field huts
    • Use of road network and seasonal changes 
    • Areas affected by pedestrians (trampling, trails)
    • Scientific activities 

b)	Survey of numbers and distribution of flora and fauna (GPS and GIS-based)
    • Mapping the breeding areas of following species: Southern Giant Petrel (optional also on Weaver Peninsula), skuas, Kelp Gull, Antarctic Tern, Snowy Sheathbill, penguins. Mapping of potential breeding birds, visitors and transients
    • Monthly seal counts
    • Seal breeding sites
    • Changes of the population of Colobanthus quitensis and repetition of the mapping of Deschampsia antarctica at exemplary sites (see Gerighausen et al. 2003, Peter et al. 2008)
    • Appearance of alien species 

c)	Assessment of the current impact of station logistic, scientific activities, leisure activities of station members to certain indicator species (fauna and flora)
    • Changes of bird breeding areas compared with previous data
    • Changes in breeding pair numbers of Southern Giant Petrels, skuas, penguins in areas affected by air and land traffic
    • Breeding success of Southern Giant Petrels, skuas, penguins as a benchmark for human impact bearing in mind other factors, too (e.g. global warming, food availability)
    • Changes in the behaviour of birds and seals as a benchmark for anthropogenic disturbance:
        ◦ Fly-off behaviour of Southern Giant Petrels, skuas and Kelp Gulls (breeders and non-breeders) due to disturbances by airplanes, helicopters, pedestrians, marathon runners, land vehicles etc.
        ◦ Reactions of resting and moulting penguins near stations
    • Damage to vegetation as a benchmark for the intensity of the study area’s utilisation. Estimation of the vegetations’ ability to regenerate from damages of which is known when they occurred.
    • Extent of disturbance using data on breeding success and recruitment rate of marked birds
    • Infringement of existing ASPA guidelines (ASPA No. 125 & No.150)
    • Leisure activities of station members, including scientists, with focus on Ardley Island

d)	Assessment of the current environmental impact of tourist activities on certain indicator species (flora und fauna) 
    • Behaviour of tourists on Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island (visitor zone).
    • The impact of tourism activities on Ardley Island regarding the breeding success of penguins and the condition of mosses and lichens.
    • Impact of increasing adventure tourism,
    • Impact of passenger landings, 
    • Documentation of the Marathon event (March 2009 & 2010): preparation of the track, the performance and the impact of the event (trampling of mosses and lichens, reactions of birds and seals)

e) Assessment of current environmental risks (e.g. by cumulative effects or alien species)
    • Survey on alien plant species (Peter et al. 2008)

f) Installation of permanent research areas (optional)
    • Marking of suitable areas to monitor the dispersion of Deschampsia antarctica 

4. Prognoses
According to the updated data regarding station use, tourist development, and human activity on Fildes Peninsula and Ardley Island, prognoses for future developments will be presented. Therefore, interrogation of station members will be an important element beside information search using data provided by national institutes, tourist companies (IAATO) etc.


5. Advancement of management proposals 
The so far proposed management measures for a potential ASMA (ATCM 2005-2007) will be analysed, updated and revised where required. This mainly refers to the management plan and the zoning system, in particular to location and size of the proposed management zones. Suggestions and proposals of Antarctic Treaty Parties as well of the International Working Group will be considered.

Particular attention will be paid to the current revision of the management plans of ASPA 125 (Fildes Peninsula) and ASPA 150 (Ardley Island). 

Germany will inform the community of Antarctic Treaty Parties about the aims and content of this research project and will report its progress regularly. Additional publications will follow.
