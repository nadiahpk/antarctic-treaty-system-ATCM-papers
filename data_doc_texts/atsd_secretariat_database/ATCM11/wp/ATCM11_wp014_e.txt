OPENING STATEMENT BY THE HEAD OF THE DELEGATION
OF NEW ZEALAND, AMBASSADOR C.D. BEEBY
AMT/XI/14

Mr. Chairman,

I would like to offer you the congratulations of my delegation on your election to guide the proceedings of this Consultative Meeting. We must express our gratitude too to the Government of Argentina for the arrangements made for this gathering and for the reception of visiting delegations. I should also like to say how much my delegation welcomes the presence for the first time of our colleagues from the Federal Republic of Germany.

These meetings are always important gatherings, forming part as they do of the whole range of international cooperation which has been built up in Antarctica since the Treaty was signed over twenty years ago. The last Consultative Meeting, the 10th, marked the 20th anniversary of the signature of the Antarctic Treaty, and delegations took the opportunity of that important landmark to look back over the work of the Treaty up till then and to consider some of the most pressing current issues.

The leader of my country's delegation spoke then of the period since the International Geophysical Year in 1957 as the era of scientific endeavour in Antarctica. He noted that by then an impressive system of effective international cooperation in the scientific field, a system not matched elsewhere and one to be supported and maintained. He noted too that under the Treaty sovereign claims continued undiminished. He then spoke of two new developments. The first was a determination on the part of Treaty countries to exercise collective responsibility for the protection of the Antarctic. The other was the growing interest in resource utilisation, with all the attendant issues that that implied.

Mr Chairman, as we all know, this too is an anniversary meeting. It is fitting that we should recognise the 20th anniversary of our Treaty's entry into force, as well as of its signature. We are in a period of evolution, from the era of man's

purely scientific exploration of Antarctica to a new era where 
the resources of Antarctica may, subject always to environmental 
protection and conservation, be used for man's benefit. Such 
evolution does not happen overnight;  nor is it easy to regulate.

Nor should it be thought that the transition should be 
absolute. Control of resources, living or mineral, has been in 
our minds in one form or another for a decade or more. Scientific 
research will continue, indefinitely we may confidently say, even 
if some of the scientific work turns more specifically towards the 
use of resources. Two anniversaries - an extended turning point - 
are not excessive in this process.

This period of evolution, of which I have spoken, has, Mr. 
Chairman, already been a productive one. We all recall with 
gratification the diplomatic conference in Canberra last year 
held under the auspices of the Treaty system, which led to the 
initialling and subsequent signature of the Convention on the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. At the time 
of signature the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs described 
it as a landmark in the history of international cooperation, 
demonstrating as it did that Treaty partners were willing and 
able to continue to cooperate even when confronted with difficult 
issues such as resources.

The living resources issue will be discussed informally 
here in preparation for the September meeting in Hobart. 
Meanwhile, not forgetting other important items on our agenda, 
we turn our attention to the even more complex issue of minerals. 
Some useful work on the topic has already been done. At this 
meeting we must call again on that history of cooperation of 
which I have spoken in order to lay the foundation for a process 
of negotiation which may well appear more daunting than the last.

For its part New Zealand is ready to negotiate in good faith 
and is confident that the Treaty system provides the best 
framework in which results can be achieved. My Government is 
convinced that for the good of Antarctica, for the interests of 
all parties here, and for the interest of the world as a whole it 
is imperative to set in place as expeditiously as possible a 
regime to regulate in an orderly fashion the exploitation of 
Antarctic mineral resources.

Such a regime should in New Zealand's view take account of 
the following three elements:

First, it should afford the widest possible protection to 
the fragile Antarctic environment. My Government, like others 
represented here, has always laid great stress on protection and 
conservation. History would forgive none of us if we transgressed 
this basic consideration.

Second, it should take account of the need for an 
accommodation between the interests of states exercising 
sovereignty and those that neither make nor recognise sovereign 
claims. It is not realistic to think that a successful 
negotiation could take place if this critical aspect of it were 
denied; and I believe everyone here realises that.

Third, we cannot, in what we do, ignore the fact that 
countries not represented here are following our work with 
interest.  The regime we negotiate should take account of that 
interest and should ensure that benefits are offered to the 
international community.

Mr Chairman, I do not minimise the difficulties these points 
imply. To resolve them successfully constitutes perhaps the 
greatest challenge so far to the Treaty system. Yet we all wish 
to preserve that system and to secure our aims within it.  With 
goodwill and determination I think we can achieve our goal.

I am optimistic enough to believe that we shall be able to 
make sufficient progress in our deliberations at this meeting to 
open the w?y for formal negotiations. This process might well 
begin, as it did in the case of marine living resources, with a 
Special Consultative Meeting to establish the framework for an 
agreement.  I:? am happy to say, Mr Chairman, that I am able to 
offer on behalf of my Government, if colleagues should desire it, 
an invitation to Consultatives Parties to attend such a meeting 
in New Zealand in March/April 1982.
