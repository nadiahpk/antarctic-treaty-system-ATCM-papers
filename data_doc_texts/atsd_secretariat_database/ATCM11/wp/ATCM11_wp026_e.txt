Draft Recommendation presented by Chile

PROTECTIVE WALLS AROUND STORAGE TANKS FOR PETROLEUM AND 
PETROLEUM BY-PRODUCTS TO AVOID RISKS OF CONTAMINATION 
FROM HYDROCARBONS OF ANTARCTIC MARINE ENVIRONMENTS 
AS A RESULT OF LEAKAGES OR SPILLS
ANT/XI/26

Draft Recommendation presented by Chile

WHEREAS:

In the scientific bases in Antarctica there are numerous tanks above ground level for the storage of petroleum by-products; these fuels are used in the operation of the bases and to supply ships and supporting aircraft. Most of these tanks are located on the shore and the volume of stored products varies, some of them containing quantities above 30,000 barrels;

At present there is a tendency to increase the number of these tanks in the new scientific bases being installed and research activities, particularly concerning the marine environment;

The greater density of scientific bases is to be found in the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, territories that are located in the areas of greatest natural risks in Antarctica (primarily earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves);

Owing to these natural causes and to others due to mechanical failures, there is constant risk of accident from breakage of or fire in a tank which would cause relatively speedy oil leakages and run-off toward the sea over ice-free areas around the shore;

Due to the slow decomposition of petroleum by-products at low temperatures, the dispersion of pollution can cover a relatively large area, depending on the morphology of the coast, the local geology, marine currents, tides, wind, and snow and ice conditions. Contamination in the bays close to the bases can generate a considerable biological impact;
ANT/XI/26                                  - 2 -

To avoid the displacement of petroleum by-products toward 
the sea resulting from breakage of or fire in the storage 
tanks, such installations should be surrounded by retaining 
walls or parapets made of rocks or cement.  The capacity of 
the dam enclosed by the parapets should be equal to or higher 
than the volume of the tanks installed;

There are standard specifications of the requirements to 
be met by the parapets and dams applied in the different coun-
tries. The best known are those published in the Code of the 
National Fire Protection Association of Boston, U.S.A., which 
are updated every year;

The Representatives,

Recalling recommendation IX-6-1, section III of the Re-
port of the Group of Ecological, Technological and Other Re-
lated Experts on Mineral Exploration and Exploitation in An-
tarctica (Washington, 1979) and ANT/X/40/Rev.2, Section II,

Aware of the risk of pollution through rupture or fil-
tration of oil and of its by-products from the storage tanks 
in scientific stations,

Considering the provisions of: the International Con-
vention on the prevention of sea water pollution by hidro-
carbons (1954) and amendments thereto made in 1962 and 1969 
(International conference on the prevention of sea water pol-
lution and the VI Assembly of the International Maritime Con-
sultative Organisation) and the Convention on the prevention 
of sea pollution by waste and other matters of 1972 (London, 
1972), and to minimise the risk of oil pollution of the An-
tarctic maritime environment,

RECOMMEND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY SHOULD CONSIDER:

The adoption of measures to protect oil storage tanks 
by surrounding the installations by parapets made of rocks or 
cement.
