Consultative Parties concerning protection of the Antarctic 
ecosystem, including in particular, Recommendations III -

Welcoming the conclusion of the Convention on the Conservation

Noting that a meeting is to be held later this year in 
Hobart, Tasmania to consider steps to facilitate the early

Recommend to their Governments that:

    Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
    Resources; and

2.  They take all possible steps to ensure the early and 
    effective operation of the bodies to be established by the 
    Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
    Resources upon entry into force.
