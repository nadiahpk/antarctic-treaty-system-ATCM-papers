AGENDA ITEM 11

SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
(Draft Recommendation Submitted by Chile)
ANT/XI/28/Rev.1

The Representatives,

Recalling recommendations VIII-3 and VIIII-4;

Noting that a management plan for a marine site of special 
scientific interest had been submitted to the Tenth Consultative 
Meeting;

Considering that the designation of such sites and 
management plans would be a matter of concern to the scientific 
Committee and Commission of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources when such institutions have 
been established;

Considering also, that until such time as those institutions 
considered the matter it would be advantageous to gather 
experience of the practical effect of a management plan relating 
to a site of special scientific interest in the marine environ-
ment;

Aware, in particular, that the designation of marine sites 
of Special Scientific Interest must not interfere with freedom 
of navigation;

Recommend to the governments that they take account of the 
following management plan:

    MARINE SITE OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
      (CHILE BAY, GREENWICH ISLAND

      M A N A G E M E N T   P L A N

(i)  Description of Site

The Site comprises two small areas of benthic habitat 
located as follows:
ANT/XI/28/Rev.1                        - 2 -

Benthic Habitat A: Between 50 and 100 m. depth and 
following coordinates:
Lat. S: 62 28,9' Long. W: 59 41' 12"
Lat. S: 62 29,3' Long. W: 59 41' 43"

Benthic Habitat B: Between 100 and 200 m. depth and the 
following coordinates:

Lat. S: 62 28,3' Long. W: 59 40' 15"
Lat. S: 62 28,7' Long. W: 59 40' 47"

(ii) Reason for Designation

These two areas are the subject of long term research 
programs and the purpose of designating them is, as far 
as possible, to reduce the risk of accidental interference 
which could jeopardize these cientific investigations.

(iii) Outline of Research

Following the volcanic eruptions of December 1967 in 
Deception Island, a long-term research program was 
initiated in Port Foster to study the re-establishment of 
the benthic fauna and flora. The two areas in Chile Bay 
are similar hydrographically and bathymetrically to the 
areas being studied in Port Foster and have been chosen 
in order to provide control areas and for rurposes of 
comparative study. The active part of the research 
program is being undertaken for the most part, in Fort 
Foster but it is important that the areas in Chile Bay 
should not be disturbed, as far as practicable, by 
extraneous influences other than those associated with 
the necessary scientific sampling procedures.

(iv) Date of Expiry Designation
June, 1985

(v) Access Points
Not applicable.

(vi) Pedestrian and Vehicular Routes
Not applicable

(vii) Other Kinds of Scientific Investigations which Would Not 
Cause Harmful Interference.
Scientific research in the water above the areas other 
than that which would grossly disturb the benthic 
eommunities.
- 3 -                 ANT/XI/28/Rev.1

(viii) Scientific Sampling 
Samples from the benthic habitats should only be taken 
for compelling scientific purposes.

(ix) The dumping of waste from ships and bottom trawling 
should be avoided. Anchoring should be avoided other 
than in compelling circumstances associated with the 
safety of life at sea.
