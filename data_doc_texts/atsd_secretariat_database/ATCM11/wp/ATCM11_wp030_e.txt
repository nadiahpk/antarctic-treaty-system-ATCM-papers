THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UNDER ARTICLES III
AND VII OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

(submitted by Australia, Chile, Federal Republic
of Germany, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom
and United States)
ANT/XI/30

Interventions in Plenary and consequent discussion amongst in-
terested participants have indicated that exchanges of inform-
ation could be made more useful. In order to study this matter
further it is suggested that Plenary might consider establishing
a Working Group with terms of reference along the following lines:

1. To consider the exchanges of information under Article III
and VII of the Antarctic Treaty with a view to seeing whe-
ther they could be made more useful and, in particular, to
consider whether:

    (a) the present date for the exchange of information about
plans (30th November each year) should be brought for-
ward, and

    (b) if so, whether the exchange of information called for
under Recommendation II-VI (Annex to Recommendation
VIII-6 para 2) should be combined with it;

    (c) some of the information called for in the Annex to
Recommendation VIII-6 might better be exchanged af-
ter rather than before the activity in question;

    (d) very brief reports on the implementation of scientific
investigations might be included in the information
exchanged;

    (e) national contact points might be designated to which
enquiries about activities could be addressed.

2. To present to Plenary, if the study so indicates, a draft
revision of the "Standard Format for the Annual Exchanges
of Information" annexed to Recommendation VIII-6.

3. To recommend to Plenary whether any proposed revision of
the "Standard Format ..." should be adopted definitively
or experimentally and be subject to review.
