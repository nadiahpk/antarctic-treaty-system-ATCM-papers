PRESENTED BY THE DELEGATION OF ARGENTINA

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON THE USE OF ANTARCTIC TOPONYMY

The Representatives,

Noting that throughout the multiple and successive An-
tartic expeditions, coming from different states, the expedi-
tionaries of the various countries have given names to the
geographic features that are part of the Antarctic continent
in particular and of ANTARCTICA in general, as an act of homage
and/or commemoration of high spiritual value;

Recognizing that, today, there are places with different
names, in several languages, in the toponymy in use among
the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty;

Aware of the opportune advisability of reaffirming the
provisions of Article IV,2. of the Antarctic Treaty, to the
effect that no acts or activities taking place while the present
Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for creating any
rights of sovereignty in the region.

Recommend to their governments that:

1. They remember that the use of toponyms in the docu-
mentation originating in the periodic meetings of the
Antarctic Treaty, in virtue of its Article IX, be they
Preparatory, Consultative or Special Consultative
meetings, shall not constitute any basis whatsoever
for asserting sovereign rights.

2. They consider the advisability of establishing tables
of equivalent toponyms in force for each Contracting
Party and always adding the geographic coordinates
corresponding to each place mentioned, so that when
referring to the geographic features of Antarctica,
no interpretative confusion can arise.
- 2 -                                  ANT/XI/24

3. That they furthermore apply the criterion establish 
herein in conducting the business of the Scientific 
Committee for Antarctic Research (S.C.A.R.), of the 
Commission and Scientific Committee institutionaliz
in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic 
Marine Living Resources, and in the agencies arisinE 
as a result of the negotiations carried out to es-
tablish a system for exploring and exploiting Antarc 
mining resources.
