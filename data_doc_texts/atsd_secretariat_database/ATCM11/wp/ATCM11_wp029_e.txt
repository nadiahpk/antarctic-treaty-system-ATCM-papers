DRAFT RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING THE AIR
DISASTER ON MOUNT EREBUS
(Presented by the Chairman)

The Representatives,

Recalling with respect that in the years of exploration
and research many have travelled to and worked in Antarctica
and not returned;

Noting that on November 28, 1979 two hundred and fifty
seven people of several nationalities lost their lives when
the aircraft in which they were travelling crashed into the
slopes of Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica;

Aware that in spite of the determined and courageous
action of members of the New Zealand and United States Antarctic
expeditions the bodies of some of those who died could not be
recovered;

Aware, too, that no permanent memorial may be placed on
the ice slopes at site of the tragedy;

Express their deep sympathy with the relatives of those
who died and with the Government and people of New Zealand;

and

Recommend to their governments that the site on the
northern slopes of Mount Erebus where the accident took place
be declared a tomb and that they ensure that the area is
left in peace.
