IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN ANTARCTICA AND
COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA
ANT/XI/25

Draft Recommendation
(Presented by the Delegation of Chile)

The Representatives,

    Considering that member countries of the Antarctic Treaty,
moved by the normal desire to maintain permanent links that will
satisfy their needs, have continued to develop systems  and
implement measures that accord with their own demands;

    Recalling that the great scientific and technical, human
and economic efforts have led to a notable advance in the
improvement of Antarctic Telecommunication Systems and in the
collection and distribution of meteorological data;

    Recognizing the notable increase in Antarctic activities,
both the increased number of scientific programmes and the
notable growth of tourism and exploration;

    Considering the greater need of meteorological data, due to
the increase in logistic activities that support these programmes;

    Bearing in mind the technological advance in the field of
transmission of telecommunications via satellite,

Recommend to their Governments that they:

1. Develop their infrastructures for incorporating the techniques
of transmission via satellite, to speed up the reception by
the Centres of Antarctic meteorological data or other informa-
tion and to ensure that other users have prompt access to it.

2. Improve their global plans for collecting and disseminating
Antarctic meteorological data, to optimise the current
diagrams which will be examined during the Twelfth Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting.

3. To request the SCAR that it study the existing telecommunica-
tion networks in Antarctica, analyze their effectiviness and
then recommend the primary and secondary networks and collec-
tion centres that should be established in Antarctica for
channeling meteorological data to world Centres and within
Antarctica.
