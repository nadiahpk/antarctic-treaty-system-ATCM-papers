DRAFT RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING THE COMMEMORATION OF THE
TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENTRY
INTO FORCE OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

RECALLING that 23rd June, 1981 is the twentieth anniversary
of the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty, which coincided
with the opening of the Eleventh Consultative Meeting of
Contracting Parties of that instrument in Buenos Aires;

AWARE

      (a) that the Consultative Parties, within the context of
the regulations of the Antarctic Treaty, have assumed a special
responsibility for the preservation of the environment and
for the rational utilisation of the resources in the area of
the Treaty;

      (b) that as a result of the activities carried out by
the Consultative Parties there is an increasing understanding
of Antarctic problems and of their relationship with, and
influence in the World;

      (c) that increasing attention and importance is being
given to all activities in Antarctica and to its future
prospects;

CONVINCED that the aforementioned instrument has for 20
years been a sound basis for the continuation and development
of co-operation in the region, based on "freedom of scientific
investigation in Antarctica as applied during the International
Geophysical Year", and accords "with the interests of science
and the progress of all mankind";

CONVINCED also that the Antarctic Treaty, in ensuring
the use of the region exclusively for peaceful purposes and
for the preservation of international harmony, will continue
to further the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter
of the United Nations;
- 2 -                                 ANT/XI/4

RECOGNISING that the special responsibility of the
Consultative Parties in Antarctica within the framework of
the Antarctic Treaty has made it possible, through its
faithful observance, to preserve peace and permitted free
scientific investigation in the area of application of the
Treaty;

RECALLING the fruitful work performed by the Consultative
Parties in Antarctica and, particularly, their efforts to
protect the environment, the fauna, the flora and the marine
living resources; to adopt standards designed to regulate
the exploration and exploitation of Antarctic resources and
obtain the maximum utilisation for science of the natural
laboratory represented by Antarctica, which the Consultative
Parties have always endeavoured to protect;

RECOGNISING the fruitful work performed in Antarctica
during the past two decades and the enormous sacrifices it
has entailed, individually and collectively, for so many
men and countries, particularly of those who have given their
lives in the performance of their work of scientific
investigation or logistic support in the region in order
to attain the goals established by the Consultative Parties
in the Antarctic Treaty,

RECOMMENDED to their Governments:

I

Scientific Investigation

That, through their respective Antarctic agencies or
the offices in charge of the corresponding research programmes,
they express their gratitude to the members of the respective
Antarctic scientific Communities, and to the Scientific
Commission for Antarctic Investigation, for endeavouring
in the past, as they are at present, to obtain a better
knowledge and understanding of Antarctic problems and to
further international acceptance of the present Antarctic
Treaty System, with all it implies.

II

Natural Resources

That they endeavour to expedite ratification of the
Convention on Antarctic Marine Living Resources, as well as
the carrying into effect of the future Regime for the
Exploration and Exploitation of Minerals, which have been
contemplated within the legal framework of the Antarctic
Treaty for the purpose of completing the original system
established thereby, with a view to the conservation and
rational use of natural resources, thus helping to consolidate
the system established under the Antarctic Treaty.

into force of the Antarctic Treaty

1. That they give consideration to the most appropriate

to disseminate information concerning the Treaty and the 
important results achieved thereunder, as a formula to 
contribute to strengthen its important goals.

2. That during 1981 they prepare commemorative events 
to celebrate the anniversary, issuing publications and 
special editions referring to it, including the possibility 
of a commemorative stamp issue in accordance with the 
suggestion in Recommendation X-9.
