Agenda Items 13, 14 and 15                                          Date: 2 July 1981
                                                                Original: English

DRAFT REPORT TO PLENARY OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
WORKING GROUP ON AGENDA ITEMS 13,14 AND 15

Chairman's Note

1.  In drawing up this report some parts have been placed with-
in square brackets indicating matters that need to be fur-
ther discussed in the Working Group, if only briefly, be-
fore these passages can stand part of the report.

2.  Attention is drawn particularly to the draft Recommendations
at Annexes A and B.
- 2 -

(e) The exchanges of information under Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty bear an important relation to the inspection provisions of the sane Article;

(f) Without in any way replacing the obligation under Article III 1(a) of the Antarctic Treaty, it would be helpful if brief reports on the implementation of scientific investigations could be provided;

(g) It would help to reduce the burden of information exchanges if the information called for under Recommendation II-VI relating to modifications in s the previous years plans could be exchanged at the same time as information about the following season's plans;

(h) It would be useful if national contact points were designated to which enquiries about activities could be addressed.

2. A difference of opinion exists between those who consider that the date by which information is to be exchanged should be brought forward in order to ensure its maximum usefulness and those who consider that the further that date is brought forward the more inaccurate information about plans would become and this inaccuracy could counterbalance the advantages of an earlier exchange date.

3. It was considered that it would be useful to have the views on these matters of those directly responsible for Antarctic programmes and of SCAR through National Antarctic Committees, thus seeking the opinion of those who both provide the major part of the information and should gain most from its timely exchange.  For this purpose a draft recommendation (Annex A) is attached for the consideration of Plenary.

4. It is suggested to Plenary that the preceding three paragraphs might constitute the basis for paragraphs to be included in the Report of the Consultative Meeting.

14. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE DOCUMENTS OF THE CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

1. In the course of a full exchange of views on this Agenda Item it was noted by the Chairman that:

(a) a distinction could be drawn between those documents of Consultative Meetings that are publicly available and those that are not;

(b) reports of Consultative Meetings are already publicly available;
Agenda Items 13, 14 and 15

DRAFT REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON AGENDA ITEMS:

13. EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION UNDER THE ANTARCTIC TREATY.
14. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE DOCUMENTS OF THE CONSUL-
TATIVE MEETINGS.
15. QUESTION RELATING TO THE APPOINTMENT OF OBSERVERS
TO THE CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS.

(Submitted to Plenary by the Chairman of the Working Group)

13. EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION UNDER THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

1. In the course of a full exchange of views on this
agenda item it was noted by the chairman that:

    (a) Information exchanged about planned activities
(Articles III, 1(a) and VII (5)) whould be as pre-
cise and accurate as possible;

    (b) Information about planned activities should be
exchanged in time "to permit maximum economy and
efficiency of operations" (Article III, 1(a)) as
between Antarctic programmes;

    (c) Jnfor?ation is not being exchanged in time to be
of maximum use to offices administering Antarctic
programmes and to those in the Antarctic who
needed it;

    (d) Antarctic operations are now beginning earlier
after the winter than had been the normal prac-
tice when the date by which information was to be
exchanged was established;
- 3 -

(c) the practice of Consultative Meetings hitherto has been that these reports of Consultative Meetings contain:

        (i)     the Recommendations adopted at the Con-
                sultative Meeting;

        (ii)    a report of the outcome of the discussion
                of each agenda item setting the associated
                Recommendation in context, or briefly des-
                cribing the scope of the discussion if no
                Recommendation had been made;

        (iii)   any papers of the Consultative Meeting
                which the Consultative parties had agreed
                should be annexed so as to adequately des-
                cribe and report the results of the Meeting;

        (iv)    a statement by the Depositary Government
                relating to the approval of Recommendations;
                and

        (v)     statements delivered by Heads of Delegation
                at the public opening session of the
                Meeting;

(d) these Reports should at least be no less infor-
        mative than those reporting recent Consultative
        Meetings;

(e) some Consultative Parties were required by their
        constitutional procedures to publish the Recom-
        mendations of Consultative Meetings;

(f) recommendation VIII-8 requires that states likely
        to become Consultative Parties, be urged to ap-
        prove Recommendations that had already become ef-
        fective;

(g) reports of Consultative Meetings should be sent
        by the host government of each Meeting to Contract-
        ing Parties that had not become Consultative Par-
        ties;

(h) at the discretion of the Consultative Parties the
        attention of a specialized agency of the United
        Nations or an international organization having a
        scientific or technical interest in Antarctica
        could be drawn to the Report of a Consultative
        Meeting, either in whole or in part, in fulfilment
        of Article III paragraph 2 of the Treaty;
- 4 -

(i) the "Handbook of Measures in furtherence of the 
Principles and Objectives of the Antarctic Trea-
ty" should be kept up to date and each language 
edition should contain the same material;

(j) while it was felt that the working documents of 
Consultative Meetings should, as is the practice 
at present, not be publicly available at the close 
of Consultative Meetings; nevertheless,

(k) some delegations believed that some papers sub-
mitted by them could be made publicly available 
if that was the understanding on which they had 
been submitted; while

(l) other delegations believed that public access to 
any paper of a Consultative Meeting (other than 
those contained in the Report of the Consultative 
Meeting) depended on there being a consensus 
that it should be made accessible;

(m) the status of papers to which the public already 
had access through other arrangements could not 
be altered by their submission to a Consultative 
Meeting;

(n) some delegations favoured the introduction of 
two series of Consultative Meeting documents 
(other than the Reports of Consultative Meetings), 
one being open to the public and the other closed;

(o) other delegations believed that such a distinction 
could inhibit the negotiating process;

(p) there could be advantage in making arrangements 
by which the working documents of Consultative 
meetings could be made available to interested 
members of the public after a period of, say, 
five years after the closing date of the Consult-
ative Meeting for which they were prepared;

2. A draft Recommendation seeking the implementation of 
the points set out in sub-paragraphs (g), (h), (i) 
and (p) above is attached at Annex B for the consider-
ation of Plenary. It is also suggested to Plenary that 
there need be no detailed report of the discussion of 
this agenda item in the Report of the Meeting.

15. QUESTION RELATING TO THE APPOINTMENT OF OBSERVERS TO THE
CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

1. In the course of a full exchange of views on this
agenda item it was noted by the Chairman that:

      (a) the existing practice of not making Observer
status available was one that was not set down
in the Rules of Procedure of Consultative Meetings;

      (b) some delegations saw a future need for an ob-
server from the Secretariat of the Commission
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources to be present at Consultative Meetings;

      (c) some delegations saw the need to establish links
between the consultative machinery of the Treaty
and acceding states that were not Consultative
Parties though this process should not go so far
as to make cbserver status available to them;

      (d) for the fulfilment of Article III Paragraph 2 of the
Treaty some delegations saw the need to establish
closer links between the consultative machinery
of the Treaty and relevant specialized Agencies of
the United Nations and other international orga-
nizations although observer status should be ac-
corded only for those consultations in which they
had a scientific or technical interest;

      (e) attention was drawn to the facility available
under Recommendation IV-24 for the discussion of
practical problems relating to Antarctic activi-
ties to which experts other than those from Con-
sultative Parties could be invited to attend with
the agreement of all Consultative Parties; such
invited experts would have the right to submit do-
cuments and make statements but not to vote;

      (f) some delegations draw attention to the additional
costs for the host government that would arise
from the presence of many observers;

      (g) some delegations drew attention to the right of
all Contracting Parties to be present at any Con-
ference held in pursuance of Article XII 2(a) of
the Treaty to review its operation; conflicting
opinions were expressed on the implications this
provision may have on the question of links bet-
ween Contracting Parties and the Consultative
machinery.

2. There being no consensus on action that might be taken regarding this question, this report is submitted to Plenary for their consideration.

3. It is suggested that there need not be a detailed report on the discussion of this agenda item in the Report of the Meeting.

                                  ANNEX A

AGENDA ITEM 13

EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION UNDER THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
(Draft Recommendation submitted to the Working Group by the
Chairman)

The Representatives,

Recalling that the exchanges of information called for under
Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty and twenty subsequent
Recommendations of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings were
consolidated into a "Standard format for the annual Exchanges of
Information" annexed to Recommendation VIII-6;

Recognising that the date for the primary exchange of
information has remained at 30 November each year since 1961 and
that the Antarctic operations of many Consultative parties now
begin much earlier than that date each year;

Noting that the SCAR Working Group on Logistics, meeting on
the occasion of the XVIth meeting of SCAR had reported with
regard to the "Exchanges of Information under the Antarctic
Treaty..... that this information.usually arrived too late to be
of use in the Antarctic operational season";

Recalling that under Recommendation II-VI any extensions,
reductions or other modifications of activities previously
reported are to be furnished before 30 June each year; and

Recognising that, while the exchanges of information should
be as useful as possible to those operations in Antarctica,
the accuracy of such exchanges needs to be ensured since they
perform an important function in relation to the inspections
provided for under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.      A review of the timeliness of exchanges of information is
        now opportune;

2.      That the first step in such a review requires that their
        offices responsible for their Antarctic programmes should
        be asked for advice as to:

        (i)     the date by which they would ideally wish to receive
                exchanged information;
- 8 -

(ii) whether each of them could assemble that part of the 
information for which they are responsible one month 
before the date identified under the preceding sub-
paragraph to allow time for transmission of the 
information through the diplomatic channel;

3. Through their National Antarctic Committees they invite 
SCAR, and in particular its Working Group on Logistics, in 
the light of the advice available to them on the question 
set out in the preceding paragraph and then to consider 
whether:

        (1) the exchange of information called for under 
Recommendation II-VI (Annex to Recommendation VIII-6 
para 2) should be combined with the exchanges called 
for under paragraph 1 of the Annex to Recommendation 
VIII-6;

        (ii) some of the information called for in the Annex to 
Recommendation VIII-6 might better be exchanged after 
rather than before the activity in question;

        (iii) without affecting the obligation contained in Article 
III-1(c) of the Treaty, brief reports on the 
implementation of scientific investigations might be 
included in the information exchanged;

        (iv) national contact points might be designated to which 
enquiries about activities could be addressed.

4. On receipt of the advice so called for from SCAR they be 
ready to consider this matter further at the Twelfth 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

					ANNEX B

AGENDA ITEM 14

ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

The Representatives recommend to their Governments that:

1. In addition to sending to Consultative Parties, certified
copied of the Report of Consultative Meetings as called for
in Recommendation I-XIV, paragraph 1, the Government of the
host country of each Consultative Meeting shall also send
copies to all other Contracting Parties;

2. In accordance with Article III paragraph 2 of the Treaty,
the Government of the host country, as and when the
Representatives of Consultative consider it appropriate, be
requested to draw the attention of any Specialized Agency of
the United Nations or eny other international organization to
any part of the Report of the Consultative Meeting relevant
to the scientific or technical interest whichthe agency or
organization might have in Antarctica;

3. The "Handbook of Measures in furtherance of the Principles
and Objectives of the Antarctic Treaty" should be available
in an up to date form and should contain the same material
in each lenguage edition;

4. The Working Documents of those Consultative Meetings that
took place more than five years before the date on which
this Recommendation becomes effective in eccordance with
Article IX paragraph 4 of the Treaty shall be made publicly
available. Thereafter, the Working Documents of each
Consultative Meeting may be made publicly available five
years after the closing date of the Meeting for which they
were prered.
