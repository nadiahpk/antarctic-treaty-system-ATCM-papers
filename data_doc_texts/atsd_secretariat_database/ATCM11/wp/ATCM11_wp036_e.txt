DISSEMINATION OF DOCUMENTS AND OBSERVER PARTICIPATION
IN CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

(Draft Recommendation presented by
the Delegation of Chile)

Recalling that the Antarctic Treaty shares the purposes and
principles of the Charter and is open for the signature of
all the member states of the United Nations;

Bearing in mind that one of the main objectives of the
Antarctic Treaty is to encourage scientific investigation and
co-operation in Antarctic territory;

Recognizing that Article III N° 1 promotes this international
co-operation in scientific investigation to the fullest possible
extent;

Considering that Article III N° 1, letter C, indicates that
scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be
made freely available;

Recognizing the advisability that all acceding countries shall
participate in the benefits of the Antarctic System; and

Observing that the Antarctic Treaty in its Article III N° 2
encourages the establishment of co-operative working relations
with those Specialized Agencies of the United Nations and
other international organizations having a scientific or
technical interest in Antarctica,

Recommend to their Governments:

1°    That the report, recommendations and annexes and all other
      information pertinent to the Antarctic Treaty in general
      be sent to the acceding countries.

2°    That the acceding countries be able to attend the opening
      session and all others of a public nature, so determined
      by the Consultative Parties.

3°    That, when the acceding countries show particular interest
      in matters dealt with at a Consultative Meeting, they may
      be invited to a special session wherein they may be heard
      and which would give rise to appropriate consultation.

4°    That, when the Consultative Parties deem it necessary,
      Specialized Agencies of the United Nations and other
      international organizations be consulted on matters of
      a technical neture within the competence of each of them
      in relation to the activities of the Antarctic system.
