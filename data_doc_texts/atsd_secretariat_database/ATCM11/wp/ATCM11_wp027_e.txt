DRAFT RECOMMENDATION TO SUPPLEMENT APPENDIX B
OF RECOMMENDATION VIII-9

AREAS OF SPECIAL TOURIST INTEREST

The Representatives,

Bearing in mind Recommendations VII-4, VIII-9and X-8,
which supplement Recommendations IV-27 and VI-7 establishing
basic standards for regulating tourist activities in the
Antarctic Treaty area;

Taking due note of the reply of SCAR to Recommendation
VI-4;

Recalling that it is the Representatives' operative
purpose to have available a list of the places where tourist
activities may be carried out, supplementing ANNEX B of
Recommendation VIII-9, whose ANNEX A was covered by Recommendation
X-8;

Recognizing that by means of this particularization
tourist groups may be kept away from other places where
scientific activities are being carried out and which will thus
remain free from interference caused by such tourist expeditions;
and

Concerned with bringing to the fore the outstanding tourist
values of Antarctica,

RECOMMEND to their governments that:
