MESSAGE FROM THE NEW ZEALAND MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ON THE OCCASION OF THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

It gives me great pleasure to convey to you, Mr. Chairman,
and to the delegations of the Consultative Parties gathered
in Buenos Aires the best wishes of the Government of New
Zealand on the 20th anniversary of the coming into force of
the Antarctic Treaty. It is fitting that the Eleventh
Consultative Meeting should have been timed to coincide
with the anniversary so that appropriate notice can be taken
of it.

We in New Zealand have every reason to be grateful - as
I am sure colleagues from other Consultative Parties are -
for the way in which the Treaty has promoted two decades of
most successful international cooperation in the field of
scientific research and exploration. It has welcomed two
new Consultative Parties during that time; and it has shown
that its consultative mechanism is capable of handling new
issues as we move to consider further measures for the
protection of the environment and a regime for the orderly
exploitation of mineral resources in Antarctica.

On behalf of the New Zealand Government, I send greetings
as the work of the Treaty system moves into its third decade.

B.E. Talboys
