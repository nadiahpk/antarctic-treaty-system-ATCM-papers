IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN ANTARCTICA
AND COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA
ANT/XI/INF/3

IMPROVEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN ANTARCTICA
AND COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA

I.  A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE SUBJECT

A. The meeting of the working group on Antarctica of the
WMO held in Australia in 1966, recommended, inter alia,
the establishment of Antarctic Regional Meteorological
Centres.

B. The Second Meeting of Antarctic Telecommunications
Experts held in Buenos Aires in 1969, made provision
for the necessary system of administrative, operational
and scientific activities in Antarctica related to the
collection and distribution of meteorological data.

C. During the Third Meeting of Antarctic Telecommunications
Experts held in Washington, D.C. in September 1978, the
possibility was suggested of establishing bilateral
contacts aimed at ensuring alternative routes to the
plan proposed by the World Meteorological Organization
and accepted by member countries in Recommendation VI-3.

D. During the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
held in Washington, D.C. in September 1979, and in
accordance with Recommendation X-3, Chile was able to
state that it has fully complied with the mandate of
improving the collection and distribution of Antarctic
meteorological data, and continues to do so.  This was
clearly established at the meeting of the Group on
Logistics, during the Sixteenth Meeting of SCAR held
in Queenstown in October 1980.
It should be noted that Recommendation X-3 refers to
the fact that the item on meteorological telecommunications
in Antarctica will be discussed by all member countries
during the Twelfth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

II. RATIONALISATION OF LINKS

A. Since 1966, the member countries of the Treaty, moved
by the normal desire to obtain safe and effective links
that would meet their own needs, have been developing
systems and implementing measures aimed at providing
a flow of telecommunications that would make possible
the prompt exchange of administrative and meteorological
data.
ANT/XI/INF/3                                  - 2 -

B. In spite of the legitimate and understandable nature of
such action, it has caused countries participating in
the  system to make great technical, scientific and
economic efforts in this sphere, which, due to the
lack of co-ordination, have led to:

1. A duplication of efforts, resulting in the failure
to optimise valuable resources.

2. In-transit errors related to the origin of the
information, and

3. Saturation and lack of order in the transmission
schedules and the use of available frequencies.

III. EFFORTS MADE BY CHILE IN THE FIELD OF ANTARCTIC TELECOM-
MUNICATIONS TO IMPROVE THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA.

A. Chile has implemented its system for perfect compliance
with its 1966 commitment with the World Meteorological
Organization, to establish, maintain and improve an
Antarctic Regional Meteorological Centre.  To this end,
it has worked on the following aspects in particular:

    1. Telecommunication Systems

        In order to improve direct links with the other
Meteorological Centres, we have developed our systems
as shown in the technical description given in Annex A.

    2. Environmental data collection system using remote
sensors and artificial satellites

        a. Continuing with the programme for the installation
of meteorological data collection platforms
reported in the working document presented at the
Tenth Consultative Meeting (ANT/X/122), our
scientists are developing new techniques to improve
the power sub-systems of these platforms and to
adapt sensors that ensure their optimum operation
in latitudes near the Pole, to be installed with
the aid of aircraft.

        b. Parts of this programme and traffic statistics
received in Santiago from the platforms are
explained briefly in Annex B.

    3. Summary of Telecommunication Practices

        Explanatory tables of links and hourly traffic observed
at Antarctic Chilean bases are given in Annex C, in
view of the need to disseminate national telecom-
munication practices in the Antarctic and pursuant to
the provision of Recommendation X-3.

ANNEX "A"

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT
AT THE PRESIDENTE FREI METECROLOGICAL CENTRE

I.  During the 1979-1980 Antarctic season, Chile renewed the
entire telecommunications equipment at the Presidente Frei
Regional Meteorological Centre.
The system entered into operation at the end of April 1980.

II. The new equipment is described as follows:

A. Principal Technical Characteristics

The system is devided into two parts or installation
areas, as follows:

    1. Location of transmitters:

Located approximately four kilometres to the south-
east of the Meteorological Centre on Ardley Island.
Comprises two modules of transmitters and one module
of generating sets.
Both modules of transmitters are connected to each
other and have the following equipment and functions:

    - Three 10 kW transmitters with a range of 2.0 to
      30 mHz, a four-antenae interconnection system
      and a ghost load through a 5 x 7 matrix channel.

    - Two 1 kW transmitters with a range of 1.6 to
      30 mHz, with a two broadband diple antenna
      interconnection system and ghost load.

    - One matrix system with a control/status panel to
      permit connection between transmitters, antennae
      and ghost adjustement load.

    - The transmitter yard employs a total of eight
      antennae, six for broadcasting traffic and two
      for Radio Relay Link, the latter of the Yagi
      12-element type.

    - A remote control system for transmitters, which
      makes it possible to control all transmitter
      command operations from the Centre: i.e., change
      of frequencies, modes, output levels for 5 kW,
      antennae, etc.
      This control and monitoring of alarm circuits is
      based on a remote control method and is sent
      through a UHF system (Radio Relay Link) that
      operates between 390 and 470 mHz, occupying a total
      of nine channels.
ANT/XI/INF/3                                 - 4 -

The third module is of generating sets and provides
the electric power for all the transmitter
installations. It is formed by two generators
powered by diesel engines, water cooled, and
designed for continuus operation.
It has a programmed automatic change system.
It also has several electronic systems that control
its performance and operational parameters. Any
anomaly in one of them will cause the system to stop
it and to make the other work in its stead, while
sending through the Radio Relay Link the corresponding
warning signals to the Centre, which has luminous
dials and an audible alarm in the event of a failure.
The diesel engines are fed from four rubber tanks
with a total capacity of 200,000 lts. of oil.

2. Location of Receivers

They are located in the Centre itself, and composed of
two modules joined together, with the following equipment
and functions:

a. SSB Operational Module

It is composed of:
- Three SSB operator posts designated with numbers
1, 2, and 3.

- One post of operator for auxiliary receiver,
designated post N o 6.

- Four teleprinters.

- One automatic voltage regulator.

Equipment per Operator

- One HF preselector
- One F8K Keyer/Demodulator
- One HF Receiver
- One Operation Control Unit

The receiver is entirely solid state and of the
synthetized type with a tuning range of 15 kHz to
30 mHz. It possesses a non-volatile type of memory
that can be programmed up to 31 pre-established
frequencies.
- 5 -                                   ANT/XI/INF/3

The teleprinters are entirely electronically operated 
in the TX/RX Modes and are equipped with puncher and 
tape reader.

The automatic voltage regulator stebilizes the AC 
voltage for the 230 volts and 50 Hz systems.

b. ISB Operational Module

    It is composed of:
    - Two ISB operator posts, designated with numbers 
      4 and 5.
    - One remote transmitter control cabinet.
    - Two facsimile chart transmitters.
    - Two facsimile chart recorders.
    - One radio relay system.
    - One power sub-panel.
    - One Patch antenna panel.
    - One trolley truck with maintenance equipment.

    Equipment per Operator
    . One pre-selector
    . One STB 750 type ARQ T.O.R. unit
    . One HF receiver
    . One ISB MA1039B operator control unit

    The facsimile transmitters use the standards recommended 
by the WMO and their operation is automatic, with up 
to four speeds of 60, 90, 120 and 240 r.p.m.

c. Radio Relay System

    It affects the radio-electric link between the 
transmitting and receiving modules.

d. Antennae: formed by:

    Three receiving Sloping "V" type antennae.
    Two dipole type receiving antennae.
    Two RX/TX Yagi type antennae for UHF link.

AUTOMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL DATA COLLECTION
VIA SATELLITE IN ANTARCTICA

A. Satellite data collection systems

There are three sub-systems, namely:

1. A series of automatic remote sensing stations, normally
installed in isolated places, equipped with the necessary
environmental sensors (meteorologic, hydrographic,
vulcanological, etc.) and with a six-to-twelve month
(or longer) operating range. Each station, referred to as
Data Collection Platform (DCP), is scheduled for the most
suitable reading and transmission intervals depending on
the kind of data to be collected.

2. A satellite, which receives the information transmitted by
the Data Collection Platforms and retransmits it to earth.
The satellite orbit is fundamental to define the intervals
of reading and transmission of environmental data. A polar
orbit satellite can retransmit data from almost any part
of the planet, but normally does so every 12 hours. A geo-
stationary orbit satellite cannot transmit data from DCPs
situated beyond 80o N or S latitude and only from the
section of the planet (1/3 approximately) over which it
is positioned; however, due to the fact that it is always
"visible", retransmission of data can take place almost
at any time.

3. A receiving station, which receives data retransmitted
by the satellite,and then processes and distributes them
among the interested agencies or institutions (via telex,
telephone, post, etc.). In this way, valuable environmental
data can be collected from isolated points automatically,
periodically and almost instantaneously at a relatively
low cost.

B. Chilean Situation

Experiments were commenced with a pilot network consisting of
4 automatic remote sensing stations (DCPs), at present
located at:

a. Meteorological Field of "Presidente Frei" Antarctic
Meteorological Centre and King George Island (since 1978);

b. King George Island, about 5 kms from "MARSH" Station,
Collins Glacier area (since 1979);

c. Meteorological Field of "Bernardo O'Higgins" Base
(since 1978);
ANT/XI/INF/3         - 8 -

d. Duse Bay, Weddell Sea Coast (since 1979). The data are 
collected via satellite ("LANDSAT" and "GOES") and are related 
to meteorological parameters, such as: speed and direction 
of the wind, air humidity and temperature, solar radiation 
and atmospheric pressure. For further particulars, see the 
documents issued by the Meeting of Experts on Antarctic 
Telecommunications (Doc. N° 7, Washington, D.C. 1978) and 
those of the Tenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
(ANT/X/12 and ANT/X/16).

C. Main Results Achieved

The experiments carried out over the last three years lead 
to the following conclusions:

1. The satellite telecommunication link from Antarctica to 
the South American Continent (reception at NASA station 
in the vicinity of Santiago) has proved satisfactory. 
A variety of data reading and transmission intervals 
have been tried out with high efficiency rates (number 
of messages received/number of messages transmitted being 
attained in all cases. In the case of operations with the 
"LANDSAT" satellite, from one to twelve messages every 
twelve hours were transmitted with efficiency ratios of 
the order of 80% and higher. In regard to the "GOES" 
satellite, readings of environmental data have been made 
at intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 3 hours (that is, 
with 4 to 48 messages transmitted every 12 hours, with 
efficiency ratios of the order of 85% and higher.

2. In the case of instantaneous reception of data for 
meteorological purposes, the "GOES" satellite is more 
suitable as it can retransmit information practically 
at any time (normally data readings are accumulated and 
retransmitted every 3 hours, although this interval may be 
reduced on the basis of a previous agreement with US.NOAA). 
The "LANDSAT" satellite, however, can only retransmit 
accumulated data every 12 hours.

3. The electronic equipment used (environmental sensors, 
transmitters, etc.) have operated under the severe 
Antarctic environment conditions.

Nevertheless, two principal kinds of problems have arisen:

    a. In some cases, the sensors used initially have proved to 
be too weak for Antarctic conditions and suffered 
considerable damage. The problem was solved by the use 
of more resistant sensors and the introduction of a more 
suitable prevention maintenance routine.

b. The meteorological information received has not always 
been the best. In some cases there are wide 
discrepancies between the readings, as measured by 
certain sensors, and what actual conditions should be. 
This problem arises from two main causes; faulty 
calibration of the sensors and/or deficient power 
supply, since in order to reduce power consumption the 
sensors used to be energized just a few seconds before 
the reading in circumstances requiring several minutes 
for the sensors to become stabilized and thus able 
to deliver a reliable signal.

4. With a view to solving the problem posed in some cases 
by the unreliability of meteorological data, the School 
of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of the University 
of Chile is developing a complet power supply system that 
uses solar and wind energy, the working of which is to 
be controlled by microprocessors. This will make it 
possible automatically to clear from the wind generator 
any obstructions resulting from freezing conditions, 
to melt the frost accumulated on solar panels, to control 
the operation of environmental sensors, to discontinue 
transmissions for a few days until exhausted batteries 
are recharged, etc.

In addition, these meteorological stations will be 
equipped with a beacon system (including luminous, sonic 
and microwave devices) to assist land transportation and 
maritime and air navigation, to be controlled at will 
from a distance. Moreover, this power supply system will 
assure internal operation of these stations the whole 
year round.

5. The assembly and anchoring system used for these 
meteorological stations has proved adequate. Until now 
use has been made of rocky monticules ("nunatak"), but 
stations for glaciers, to be tested shortly, have also 
been designed. These stations are assembled like meccanos 
on site, so that they are easily transported and can be 
operating a few hours later.

D. Future Projections

Considering the results obtained, it is intended to supplement 
the measurement system with mobile stations, adrift on the 
ocean or mounted on icebergs. For such cases, the satellite 
"TIROS-N" or "NIMBUS" will be used. Once the problem of 
permanent and reliable flow of environmental information 
has been solved, the system (considering oceanographic, 
vulcanologic, glaciologic, ecologic, as well as meteorologic 
variables) will be extended to the greater part of Antarctica, 
as shown in Figure 1, and it will be possible to feed these 
data into the World Meteorological Network.
ANT/XI/INF/3                                  - 10 -

Although it is true that the system is currently being
evaluated, an extension to very distant areas in Antarctica
was regarded as difficult.

The problem no longer exists as, with the contribution of
the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) and the inauguration
of the landing strip on King George Island, it will be
possible to make scientific expeditions throughout the
whole of the Antarctic continent. Furthermore, the excellent
telecommunications link between the Frei Antarctic Meteorolo-
gical Centre and Santiago will make it possible to distribute
these data rapidly and reliably to the other centres for
use.

This environmental information will be a valuable contributic
to the vast scientific programmes that Chile is implementing,
where air support is of fundamental importance.
