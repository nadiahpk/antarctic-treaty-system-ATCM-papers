ANTARCTIC STATION "TENIENTE RODOLFO MARSH"

1.      Acting in the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty and with the aim of implementing its research and technical programmes that will lead to a greater knowledge of the Antarctic Continent, Chile has built the "Teniente Rodolfo Marsh Station" on Fildes Peninsula of King George Island in the southern Shetlands, only two and a half hours by air from the city of Punta Arenas (Hercules C-130). The new installations and logistic facilities provide permanent year-round support, bringing to an end the winter isolation to which both the personnel in the Chilean Stations and in the numerous Stations of member countries of the Treaty in the sector of the Antarctic Peninsula and in adjacent islands have been exposed.

2.      The focal point taken as a basis for building the "Teniente Marsh" Station was the "Presidente Frei" Regional Meteorological Centre located in the peninsular sector at 62°12'00"S and 58°55'00" W, which was established for this purpose on March 7, 1969, following the destruction of the Chilean installations on Deception Island by volcanic eruptions on that Island in 1967 and 1970.

3.      The Marsh Station has a landing strip of compacted gravel, located 1.6 km northeast of the Meteorological Centre. There is an air terminal containing housing units with accommodations for 70 passengers in transit, a parking area for two Hercules C-130, a hangar with sufficient space for housing a Buffalo DHC-5E plane and two UH-1H helicopters, as well as several smaller installations. A road for motorized traffic links the air terminal with the Meteorological Centre. New installations have been built in this area to house the new telecommunication equipment, a hangar for helicopters and additional facilities for the personnel.

5. Marsh airfield has remained in operation since its
inauguration in March 1980 with the landing of two
Twin Otter and one Hercules C-130 aircraft. Since
then, and during 1980 a total of 632 flight hours
have been completed, and 210 tons and 890 passengers
have been carried, including the rescue operation and
repairs to the Canadian Buffalo aircraft which took place
in the middle of the Antarctic winter (July) over a
glacier in the Antarctic Peninsula at a distance of
approximately 100 km southwest of Marsh Station.

6. Chile, guided once more by the lofty spirit of scientific
co-operation prevailing in the sphere of the Antarctic
Treaty, has the honour of placing at the disposal of
researchers of the member countries of the Antarctic
Treaty the logistic facilities existing at Marsh Station,
particularly for emergencies and as an alternative
airport the whole year round.
