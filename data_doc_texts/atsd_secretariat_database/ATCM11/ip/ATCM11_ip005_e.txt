DETERMINATION OF WATER CONTAMINATION OF THE SCOTIA SEA,
DRAKE PASSAGE, WEDDELL SEA AND BELLINGSHAUSEN SEA
IN THE ANTARCTIC THROUGH OIL

Our country, through the scientific group of the Argentine
Antarctic Institute, has taken 350 samples from the Weddell, Scotia
and Bellingshausen seas and the Drake Passage to study water
pollution through oil.

The method used was spectrofluorometry, which is highly
sensitive and is described in Operational Guide N° 7 published
by UNESCO, and was studied with the assistance of Drs. E.N.
Levy and Adam Zsolnay and adopted by the Integrated Global
Ocean Station System (IGOSS).

This method establishes only existence of hydrocarbons
with condensed benzenic groups in oil, but does not determine
biogenic hydrocarbons.

In view of the existence of differences in the chemical
composition of oils, the data referred to oil taken from a
well in Tierra del Fuego and to chrysene. The data are
expressed in microgrammes of Tierra del Fuego oil per
millilitre of sea water. The values found most frequently
are in the order of 0.03 microgrammes per millilitre of sea
water, but in some very small areas in the Weddell Sea and
the Scotia Sea, values have been established ranging between
0.10, 0.12 and 0.13 microgrammes per millilitre of sea water.

It is considered that this increase in values may be
caused by the filtration of hydrocarbons through fissures
in the ocean bed, since pollution caused by sea-going vessels
cannot be considered for the time being.
