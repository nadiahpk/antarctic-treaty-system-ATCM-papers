IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2012-13 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2013-14 Season
IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism: 2012-13 Season and
Preliminary Estimates for 2013-14 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide an overview of Antarctic tourism from
IAATO operators for the recently completed 2012-13 season and
estimates for the 2013-14 season.
The total number of passengers and clients, including cruise-only,
carried by IAATO operators during the 2012-13 season increased to
34,316. While this is an increase of 29.4% over the previous
2011-12 Antarctic tourism season (26,519), the total is not
significantly different than 2009-10 and 2010-11 when totals were
36,881 and 33,824 respectively. Details of the 2012-13 season can
be found in Appendix 1 of this paper.
The increase was due to several factors. These included a mild
resurgence of voyages by cruise-only vessels carrying more than
500 passengers from five to seven, accounting for 9,070 passengers,
which is approximately 5,000 more than the previous year.
Landings in the Antarctic Treaty area are not permitted from vessels
carrying more than 500 passengers.
Growth was also seen in the tourism segment that includes
traditional small and medium-size expedition ships and yachts – all
carrying 500 or fewer passengers and conducting landings – from
20,271 to 23,305 passengers. Numbers increased in the air-cruise
category, up from 860 during 2011-12 to 1,587 for the season just
ended. Air-land tourism declined more than 30% from 516 to 354
visitors during the 2012-13 season.
Estimates for the 2013-14 season can be found in Appendix 3 of this
paper. These estimates are based on information provided to IAATO
by its operators as of May 7, 2013, and indicate only a minor
increase of 3% to a total of 35,354 tourists.
1.0 Overview
1.1 IAATO Member Activities
IAATO’s Membership continues to incorporate the majority of
private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS passenger ship
operators conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty area
are current members of IAATO. All of these operators have
submitted Environmental Impact Assessments (Initial
Environmental Evaluations or Preliminary Assessments) or
operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.
A summary of IAATO operator activities for the 2012-13 season
follows:
24,892 passengers landed from seaborne vessels in the Antarctic
Treaty Area, a 17.7% percent increase over the previous season’s
total of 21,131 vessel-landed passengers. Of this total:
22,369 passengers aboard 178 voyages on traditional seaborne
vessels landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area, a 16.1% increase
over the previous season’s 19,269 passengers and 173 voyages;
608 passengers took part in eight voyages to the Ross Sea or
Continental region of Antarctica, a decrease from the previous
season’s 773 passengers and 11 voyages;
328 passengers sailed on 41 trips aboard yachts (sailing or motor)
that carry 12 or fewer passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area,
an increase over the previous season’s 229 passengers and 30 trips;
1,587 passengers participated in 24 air-cruise trips in the Antarctic
Peninsula area, flying to/from King George Island (either one-way
or round-trip) from/to South America to embark a vessel and cruise
for approximately one week, making landings. This represents an
increase over the 860 passengers and 15 air-cruise trips during the
2011-12 season. The three IAATO operators participating in this air-
cruise segment included one operator with a decade of air-cruise
experience and two other operators – both experienced in
traditional seaborne cruising – offering the air-cruise concept for
the second season in a row.
9,070 passengers travelled on seven voyages aboard 500-plus-
passenger vessels operating “cruise-only” voyages, making no
landings in the Antarctic Treaty Area. This represents an increase
from the 4,872 passengers and five voyages of the 2011-12 season,
but is less than the 14,373 passengers and 10 cruise-only voyages
during the 2010-11 season.
354 clients participated in expeditions in the continental interior, a
decrease from the 516 clients in this segment during the 2011-12
season.
No passengers participated in IAATO operator over-flights to the
Antarctic continent.
1.2 Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism
Commercial tourism activities included the operation of small boats
(Zodiac, Polar Cirkle Boat, R.I.B., Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and
to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving,
skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays),
running events, helicopter operations and use of an underwater
ROV. Most of these activities have taken place for the past decade
with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the
late 1960s.
Appendices 1 and 3 to this overview provide further details of the
scope of IAATO-member activities, including vessel/aircraft,
departures, passenger numbers and activities.

The vast majority of tourism voyages operate in the Antarctic
Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season
(from November to March), departing from Ushuaia or, to a lesser
extent, from other ports north of the Antarctic Treaty Area.
1.3 Nationalities
The Post Visit Report Forms submitted to IAATO indicate that more
than 100 different nationalities were represented in tourists who
visited the Antarctic during the 2012-13 season. The majority (83.3
percent) came from eight different countries (see Table 2).

1.4 Commercial Tour Vessels Operating in 2012-13
A full list of IAATO member-operated commercial tour vessels that
completed cruises to the Antarctic, including information on their
registry, permitting authority and passenger capacity is given in
Appendix 1. In total, there were 21 vessels carrying 13-200
passengers; three vessels carrying 201-500 passengers; plus four
cruise-only vessels each carrying more than 500 passengers.
1.5 Yacht (Sailing and Motor) Activities
Seventeen yachts carrying 12 or fewer tourists visited the Antarctic
Treaty Area by IAATO member yacht operators during the 2012-13
season. This information is also detailed in Appendix 1.
IAATO yacht operators accounted for 56.2% of the yachts sighted in
the Antarctic Treaty Area during 2012-13, an increase from the
37.8 percent of the total known number of yachts visiting
Antarctica during 2011-12. Noting that a greater percentage of the
non-IAATO non-IAATO yachts sighted seem to be securing
authorization, IAATO is pleased that the yacht outreach campaign
seems to have been effective. The intention is to continue that
campaign as the issue of non-authorised yachts, whose crews may
not be familiar with the Environmental Protocol and its obligations
or the peculiarities of the Antarctic environment, remains a concern
Yacht sightings in the Antarctic Peninsula are further described in
ATCM XXXVI IP54 Data Collection and Reporting on Yachting
Activity in Antarctica in 2012-13.
1.6 IAATO Member-Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition
Vessels and Yachts
Details of the activities offered are listed in Appendix 1 and
Appendix 3. All activities are approved or authorized through the
Environmental Impact Assessments and Advance Notification
submitted in advance of the season. All activities are intended to
have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic
environment and have been conducted from expedition vessels and
yachts for more than a decade.
Additional information on Antarctic Peninsula activities is
presented in ATCM XXXV IPXX Report on IAATO Operator use of
Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines,
2012-13 Season.
1.7 Commercial Land Tourism
Three IAATO operators conducted land tourism activities during the
2012-13 season. Adventure Network International / Antarctic
Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) – one of the founding members of
IAATO in 1991 –
conducted activities for the 27th consecutive season; and The
Antarctic Company (TAC) operated in Antarctica for the eight
consecutive season and fourth as an IAATO operator.
The third company is White Desert (WDL),which operated in
Antarctica for the seventh consecutive season and second as an
IAATO operator. Flights and logistics for WDL are coordinated
through TAC.
ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile; TAC and WDL operated
out of Cape Town, South Africa.
The three companies employed experienced guides; over 80% of
which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist
in the preparation of policies and guidelines, and ensure their
implementation in Antarctica.

1.7.2 Aircraft Operations
ALE:
An Ilyushin-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, fuel,
staff, guides and clients from Punta Arenas to SCGC Runway 18M
Union Glacier.
Two ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and one ski-equipped
Douglas DC-3 aircraft were used for flights in Antarctica and to
support medical evacuation throughout the Antarctic season.
TAC:
An Ilyushin-76 was used to ferry general cargo, staff, guides and
clients from Cape Town to ALCI Airbase / Novo Runway, chartered
by Antarctic Logistics Center International (ALCI).
Two ski-equipped DC-3 aircraft were used for flights within
Antarctica and SAR support during the Antarctic season, in
conjunction with ALCI.
1.7.3 Traverses
Both ALE and TAC operated a number of motorised traverses,
primarily for more efficient transport of fuel and cargo. These were
conducted in support of both scientific activities and non-
governmental expeditions.
1.7.4 Camps
ALE Union Glacier Camp opened October 24, 2012 and closed
February 19, 2013.
TAC Camp opened November 11, 2012 and closed February 28,
2013.
WDL Camp opened November 6, 2012 and closed January 29,
2013.

1.8 Air / Land Activities conducted by IAATO Members in the
Antarctic Peninsula As Aerovias DAP, which is not an IAATO
member, was the operator of record for these 61 passengers, they
are not included in the overall statistics in the Overview addendum.
For the 2012-13 season, IAATO Associate Member Destination
Management Chile (DMC), operating through Aerovías DAP (a non-
IAATO member), conducted two separate day-trips from Punta
Arenas, Chile to King George Island. A total of 61 passengers were
escorted to Frei and Bellingshausen Bases and took part in Zodiac
rides to Ardley Island in groups of 20 visitors at a time. Eight other
planned trips were cancelled due to weather conditions, not
meeting the minimum numbers, or other external factors.
1.9 Air Operations – Over-flights operated by IAATO Members
For the 2012-13 season, there were no over-flights of Antarctica by
IAATO members.
2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2013-14
Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are
projected for the 2013-14 season. According to estimates provided
to IAATO by its member operators (as of May 7, 2013), 23,348
seaborne and yacht passengers are expected to land in Antarctica
from commercially organized vessels, 1,588 from combination air-
cruise programs, and 498 on air/land expeditions during the
2013-14 season. Another 9,920 are anticipated on cruise-only
programs. No over-flights by IAATO operators are expected during
the 2013-14 season.
Ship-based tourism is expected to again include the operation of
small auxiliary boats, shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing,
running events, SCUBA diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping
(including short overnight stays), helicopter operations and use of
underwater ROVs.
For the 2013-14 season, those tourism categories where passengers
land ashore – traditional small and medium-size expedition ships
and yachts, all carrying 500 or fewer passengers – is expected to
remain flat, with an expectation of only 43 more visitors (from
23,305 to 23,348). Numbers will also remain virtually unchanged in
the air-cruise category: 1,587 for the season just ended compared to
the 1,588 estimated for 2013-14.
Cruise-only tourism, aboard 500-plus passenger vessels with no
passengers landing ashore, is expected to increase around 9%, from
9,070 to 9,920, although the number of voyages remains the same:
seven. Air-land tourism by the three IAATO Members that provide
deep field excursions and expeditions is also projected to increase
from the 354 visitors transported inland this past season to 498 for
the 2013-14 austral summer.
These estimates indicate the potential for a growth in tourism
numbers, IAATO members will continue to work together so that
operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible
manner, and that tourism activities have no more than a minor or
transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
3.0 Tourism Trends
A trends chart showing the change in IAATO operator landed
passengers, dating from the 1992-1993 season and including
