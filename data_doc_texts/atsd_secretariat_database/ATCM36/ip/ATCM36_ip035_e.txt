The non-native grass Poa pratensis at Cierva Point, Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula – on-going investigations and future eradication plans


Information Paper submitted by Argentina, Spain and the United Kingdom 



At CEP XV, Spain, the United Kingdom and Argentina presented IP 13, which described the colonisation status of the non-native grass Poa pratensis at Cierva Point, Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula.  The grass was introduced to the site inadvertently during transplantation experiments in 1954-55, but recent research has shown that since 1995 the grass has started to expand its area of coverage.  There are concerns that it may spread further and impact local indigenous communities, including those within ASPA 134 Cierva Point and offshore islands, Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula.

The CEP non-native species manual recommends that eradication of non-native species be undertaken as a priority to prevent an increase in the species' distribution range and to make eradication simpler, cost effective and more likely to succeed.  

In light of this recommendation, Argentina, Spain and the United Kingdom continued with their research on Poa pratensis during the Antarctic season 2012/2013, and are investigating the most appropriate method to eradicate this non-native grass:  

    • An eradication feasibility study is being undertaken by scientists from Argentina, Spain and the United Kingdom.  Poa pratensis is a rhizomatous grass, so it is essential that not only the visible plants are removed, but also all roots and rhizomes to prevent re-growth. In addition, care should be taken to avoid accidental spread of Poa pratensis propagules during the eradication work.  
    • Brief visits to the site in January 2012 and March 2013 allowed Spanish and Argentinean scientists to establish the degree of the association between the non-native grass Poa pratensis and the native grass Deschampsia antarctica.  The eradication method selected must have as little impact as possible on native species and the soil environment, yet ensure effective eradication of the non-native grass.
    • South Africa provided technical information on non-native plant eradications based on experiences on sub-Antarctic Marion Island.  South Africa is thanked for its generous help. 
    • Further research was performed by Argentina, Spain and the United Kingdom, on the colonization and reproductive status of the non-native grass. 

It is hoped that the final stage of research and the final design of the eradication method will be completed during the 2013/14 season and that the eradication process would begin after this, with on-going monitoring of the site during subsequent seasons to ensure the eradication was successful.
