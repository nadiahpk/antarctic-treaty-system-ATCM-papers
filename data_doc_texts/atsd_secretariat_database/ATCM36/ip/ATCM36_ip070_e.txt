Environmental Damage Repair: 
Disassembling of Ferraz Station, Admiralty Bay, Antarctica

Bearing in mind WP53, presented during the XXXV ATCM, held in Hobart, Brazil presents the structure of the Environmental Management Plan that guided the disassembling of Comandante Ferraz station, destroyed by a fire on the 25th of February 2012. The Environmental Management Plan has been elaborated and implemented with the support of several specialized institutions, under the coordination of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment.

The Logistical Disassembling Plan (Table 1) designed by Brazil was divided in six phases, carried out during the 2012-2013 summer and, in each phase, measures to prevent environmental damage were included. 
The phases were:

    • Phase 0: An environmental emergence specialized team was sent to the accident scene, to make an initial diagnosis of the environmental damage and to establish priorities of waste removal, considering hazardous substances. After these activities, EACF was closed and prepared for the winter, in order to minimize ice and snow penetration inside the station.

    • Phase 1: The Environmental Management Plan was developed by the Environmental Evaluation Group of the Brazilian Antarctic Program (GAAm/PROANTAR). During this phase, the necessity of equipment and personnel training to implement the environmental management was defined.

    • Phase 2: Purposing of preventive measures to minimize risks during the activities of boarding of personnel, material and equipment.

Phase
Activities planned
0
Preparation of EACF for the winter of 2012
1
Establishment of logistics necessities, equipments and training 
2
Boarding of personnel , material and equipments in the ships
3
Clearance of the Operation Area and establishment of plans for Environmental Containment, Health and Work Safety
4
Unload Material and Personnel to the EACF
5
Disassembling and Clearance Operation
6
Demobilization.


    • Phase 3: This phase was carried out at the beginning of 2012-13 summer, when the Brazilian Navy and environmental institutions arrived at Comandante Ferraz Station to start the clearance operation of the area. After 10 days of snow removing, the team finally had access to the internal area of the station. 

The scenario found by the environmental team was:
    • Heavy snow and ice accumulation outside the main structure (over 4 meters high). No defrosting signs;
    • High risk associated to the instability of the main structure;
    • High risk associated to the disposal of iron remains;
    • High risk of slippage, due to a thin ice layer.

Considering this scenario, the environmental specialists recommended the immediate start of the disassembling, before the defrosting, in order to minimize environmental damage and accidental risks.

    • Phases 4, 5 and 6: The Environmental Management Plan was based on the Initial Danger Evaluation Methodology (APP, in Portuguese). For these phases, the following sub-plans were: 
    • Support for installation of infrastructure activities;
    • Prevention and control of erosive and siltation processes;
    • Waste management;
    • Wastewater management;
    • Atmospheric emissions control;
    • Water supply management;
    • Signaling and Security;
    • Disassembling and equipment;
    • Fueling operation control;
    • Traffic of machines and bulldozers;
    • Personnel training;
    • Personnel health and safety;
    • Hazardous substances transport, storage and handling;
    • Environmental damage monitoring.

Environmental specialists were present in the Comandante Ferraz area during the entire Brazilian Summer Operation, managing the implementation of environmental programs. All measures were followed and environmental non-conformities, when verified, were immediately corrected.

In addition, environmental samples were collected in order to analyze possible damage and, according to the results, a remediation plan will be implemented in the next summer.
