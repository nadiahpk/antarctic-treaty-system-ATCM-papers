SAR-WG: Cooperation between Australia’s search and rescue and Antarctic agencies on SAR coordination
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
This paper outlines the arrangements for cooperation between Australia’s search and rescue (SAR) and Antarctic agencies on SAR coordination in the Antarctic region. 
In accordance with applicable international SAR conventions, Australia’s search and rescue coordination responsibilities for the Australian Search and Rescue Region (Australian SRR) are delivered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), through Australia’s Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC Australia). 
The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) manages Australia’s Antarctic program. As the primary Australian Antarctic operational agency, AAD may be first to become aware of a distress situation in its region of Antarctic operations, may need to assume initial coordination responsibility, and in some circumstances may be best placed to respond. AAD is also well placed to liaise with other Antarctic organisations, and provide Antarctic specific support to AMSA as required.
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between AMSA and AAD defines the division of responsibilities between AMSA and AAD in relation to SAR coordination in the Antarctic region, and puts in place operational procedures to effectively coordinate a response to a SAR incident.
Introduction
The Australian Search and Rescue Region (Australian SRR), as defined in the International Maritime Organisations (IMO) and International Civil Aviation Organisation ICAO) Global SAR Plans includes waters and, for aviation, lands in the Antarctic Treaty area. Australia’s obligations for search and rescue in accordance with the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979 ( SAR Convention) and Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944 (as amended) (Chicago Convention) are met by AMSA, which operates Australia’s Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC Australia). The RCC has responsibility for coordination of SAR incident response for maritime and civil aviation incidents, and also provides maritime safety communications and maritime safety information. RCC Australia is also the Mission Control Centre for the Cospas-Sarsat satellite system. 
The AAD manages the Australian Antarctic program, and has facilities, operational, and organisational capabilities which may be of assistance in an Antarctic SAR incident. The AAD has direct operational linkages with other national Antarctic programs, and participates in relevant international forums such as the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP). 
In recognition that both agencies may have a role in Antarctic SAR coordination, an MOU is in place, including details on:
    • the division of responsibilities between each organisation; 
    • coordination and operational procedures; 
    • sharing of information; and 
    • specific operational procedures.
The MOU defines responsibilities for both coordination and response roles. The MOU is not intended to derogate from Australia’s SAR obligations under the conventions.  More information is outlined below.

Division of responsibilities between agencies
Under the MOU, AMSA assumes overall coordination of SAR response operations in the Australian SRR for:
    • international civil aircraft, civil and recreational Australian registered aircraft; 
    • vessels in distress; and
    • distress beacon alerts from an aircraft or vessel.
AMSA also provides:
    • maritime safety communications;
    • maritime safety information for ships at sea; and
    • SAR alerting services for distress beacons from land-based sources.

For SAR incidents on land in the AAD’s Antarctic area of operations, the role of AAD is to:
    • assume overall coordination of SAR for land-based incidents for AAD activities;
    • provide SAR response for AAD’s own activities;
    • where practicable, assume overall coordination for other land based SAR incidents reported by AMSA (including liaison with other Antarctic organisations). 
For maritime SAR incidents in AAD’s area of operations, the AAD:
    • assumes coordination responsibility for AAD activities (transferring overall coordination to AMSA if management of the incident is beyond AAD’s capability);
    • provides support to AMSA for responses to incidents involving activities other than AAD activities;
    • provides support for medical evacuation of mariners requiring urgent medical assistance.
For aviation SAR incidents in AAD’s area of operations, the AAD:
    • assumes overall coordination responsibility for AAD activities (transferring overall coordination to AMSA if management of the incident is beyond AAD’s capability);
    • provides support to AMSA for responses to any other activities including the land search component for a missing aircraft.
The MOU recognises that complex or protracted SAR operations are likely to be beyond the capability of the AAD to coordinate. For incidents where AAD is providing a primary coordination role, this is carried out in close contact with AMSA, and drawing on AMSA’s capabilities as required. 
Coordination and operational procedures
The MOU establishes that for all where both parties are involved, formal agreement is to be reached between AMSA and AAD as to which agency is carrying out the overall coordination of the response, to avoid any ambiguity.
Sharing of information
The MOU provides for the exchange of information between AAD and AMSA to support SAR operations, including details of the positions and individuals with the authority to approve requests to access information. The MOU establishes that information may not be further released to others, without prior agreement.
Specific operational procedures
A schedule to the MOU (which is regularly reviewed and updated) contains contact details for key functions and roles within each agency. The schedule also provides details of resources that may be available for response to a SAR incident, covering resources owned or contracted by the Australian Government as well as private providers. Details of AAD operated Antarctic resources (aviation, maritime, and land-based) are included, as well as contact details for other national Antarctic programs and COMNAP.
Information about other resources is provided, including support for ice navigation (imagery and analysis), mapping support, and Antarctic weather forecasting.
Conclusion
The arrangements outlined in this paper are specific to the circumstances of Australia, taking into account the responsibilities and capabilities of the relevant agencies, the proximity of Australia to Antarctica, the Australian search and rescue region, and Australia’s area of Antarctic operations. 
Australia provides this information to assist Parties in understanding how Australia’s agency with responsibility for SAR coordination in the Australia SRR, and Australia’s Antarctic operational agency cooperate to discharge Australia’s SAR coordination obligations for the Antarctic region.
