Report by the Depositary Government for the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in Accordance with Recommendation XIII-2, Paragraph 2(D)
Report submitted by the United Kingdom

New Accessions to CCAS

During 2012, the United Kingdom received requests from both the Kingdom of Spain and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to accede to CCAS.  In accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Convention, the UK sought the consent of the Contracting Parties to invite both Spain and Pakistan to accede.  The UK received notifications of consent from all Contracting Parties by 25th March 2013.

As Pakistan had already sent their instrument of accession to the UK on 17th January 2012, Pakistan will formally accede to CCAS on 24th April 2013 (being 30 days after the last notification of consent).

The UK sent an invitation to the Spanish Government to formally deposit their instrument of accession on 25th March 2012.  Spain will formally accede 30 days after this is received by the UK.

The full list of countries which were original signatories to the Convention, and countries which have subsequently acceded is attached to this report (Annex A).

CCAS Annual Return 2011/2012

Annex B lists all capturing and killing of Antarctic seals by Contracting Parties to CCAS for the reporting year 1 March 2011 to 29 February 2012.

CCAS Annual Return 2010/2011

The United Kingdom regrets to inform Parties that two errors were identified with the Report submitted to ATCM XXXV (IP005):
    a) The list of seals captured by the United States of America should have stated: 600 Antarctic fur seals, 50 Leopard seals, 50 Southern Elephant seals, 1380 Weddell seals. Total: 2080 seals; and
    b) The number of seals captured by Australia should have stated 69 instead of 67.

A revised table for 2010/2011 is therefore included in this year’s report at Annex C.

Next CCAS Annual Return

The United Kingdom would like to remind Contracting Parties to CCAS that the Exchange of Information, referred to in Paragraph 6(a) in the Annex to the Convention, for the reporting period of 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2013 is due by 30 June 2013.  CCAS Parties should submit their returns, including nil returns, to both the United Kingdom and to SCAR.  The UK would like to encourage all Contracting Parties to CCAS to submit their returns on time.  

The CCAS report for the reporting period 2012/2013 will be submitted to ATCM XXXVII, once the June 2013 deadline for exchange of information has passed.
