Report on Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships operating in Ushuaia during the 2012/2013 Austral summer season 
Summary
This paper provides information about the flows of passengers and vessels that visited Antarctica during the 2012/2013 Austral summer season, operating from the port of Ushuaia. Also, it identifies the vessels which operated in Antarctica and which called at the port of Ushuaia, the number of voyages that took place, passengers and their nationalities, average number of crew per vessel, expedition staff, tour operators, vessel owners, ship management companies and the registers of ships.
Introduction
Ushuaia (54º 48’ S - 68º 19’ W), located at the southern tip of South America, is the most active gateway city to Antarctica in terms of Antarctic shipborne tourism, and it concentrates more than the 90% of the worldwide Antarctic tourist activity.   
The development of airport and port infrastructure in Ushuaia has contributed to facilitate operations of Antarctic cruise ships. This, in addition to the short distance between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula, has allowed tour operators to extend their Antarctic operating schedules.  
With respect to the vessels that operate from Ushuaia, a distinction should be made between those that make landings and those of a much larger size which just sail Antarctic waters without landing passengers. Similarly, a further distinction should be made between those vessels that arrive in Ushuaia as part of a more extended South American itinerary, and those which call in Ushuaia as the port of base from which they run their Antarctic voyages. In general terms, these operations refer to passenger turnaround, port and land services as well as the general supply of provisions and tourist services. Also, at the beginning and at the end of the Antarctic season most vessels arrive at the port of Ushuaia and/or depart on a positioning voyage from or towards other destinations.
In order to present the status of Antarctic tourist flows of visitors and vessels in Ushuaia in the 2012/2013 season, data was collected from the manifests1 provided by cruise ships to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority). This information was compared to itineraries provided by tour operators on their websites, and to data obtained from enquiries whenever needed. With regard to these sources of information a database is built for each tourist Antarctic season.
This document updates the data given in similar papers presented by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting since 2009, providing information that may contribute with different aspects of discussions related to the Antarctic tourism issue.
Brief review of the Antarctic tourist flows and cruise ships that operated through Ushuaia during the 2012/2013 Austral summer season 
Austral summer season started on November 03rd 2012 when the MV Plancius (Oceanwide Expeditions) departed from Ushuaia to Antarctica, and finished on April 3rd 2013 with the arrival of the MV Ushuaia (Antarpply Expeditions). A total of 1972 voyages run by 26 vessels took place, including the SV Bark Europa and the MY Hanse Explorer. January was the busiest month as regards the number of Antarctic voyages (30 %) followed by December and February (See Figure 1).

A total of 31.994 visitors went to Antarctica through Ushuaia during the 2012/2013 season. Of these, three categories may be identified: a) those that both departed from and returned to the port of Ushuaia, b) those that either departed from or arrived in Ushuaia -that is to say, passengers who were in Ushuaia once either on the arrival or departure- and c) those that visited Ushuaia in transit on their way to or from Antarctica, embarking or disembarking at other ports (See Table 1).
In the first case, passengers were counted only upon departure from Ushuaia. In the second case, several vessels either started or finished their voyages in other ports, and some visited Antarctica as part of the voyage of the beginning or end of the season, and then operated from Ushuaia the rest of the time; in this instance the passengers who arrived at or departed from the port of Ushuaia were taken into account. Finally, the vessels in transit carried more than 500 passengers and cruised in Antarctica only without making any landings. Their visit to the Antarctic Peninsula was just part of a longer voyage in South America or a more extensive itinerary. Passengers in transit were counted upon arrival or departure, depending on the East or West direction of the cruise ship when calling at the port of Ushuaia.

Antarctic visitors travelled in tourist vessels of different sizes. A distinction is made in relation to the provisions of Measure 15 (2009) adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Therefore, taking into account the average number of passengers on board, it is noticed that 23 vessels (77 %) were cruise ships that carried up to 500 or fewer passengers whereas 3 vessels (23 %) carried more than 500 passengers. An average number of crew members and passengers3 as well as the number of voyages per vessel are presented in Table 2; and in Figure 2 passenger averages per vessel are shown.

Furthermore, 16 vessels ran regular voyages to and from Antarctica operating throughout the season from Ushuaia, and they account for 62 % of the total number of vessels. Each vessel made between 7 and 14 voyages to Antarctica, as indicated in Figure 3. It is worth noticing that the MV Ocean Nova (Antarctica XXI), MV Polar Pioneer (Aurora Expeditions) and MS Sea Adventurer (Quark Expeditions), had a different deployment in December, January and February, when they conducted voyages from 25 de Mayo Island, embarking passengers whose arrivals and departures were from Punta Arenas (Chile) by airplane. 

With regard to vessels in transit in Ushuaia, most of them are large cruise ships, which cruise Antarctic waters but do not make passenger landings in Antarctica. As it has been previously stated, these cruise ships are on itineraries round southern South America or on more extensive voyages, and on certain itineraries, they include a visit to Antarctica. Most of these cruise ships run “pendular” voyages along Beagle Channel to connect ports located by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and visit Antarctica either from the Atlantic or from the Pacific. Table 3 provides an overview of these cruise ships through Ushuaia including the number of crew and passengers per voyage and indicating if the visit to Antarctica was before or after the port call in Ushuaia.

As regards visitors who went to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, the nationalities of passengers were counted. In this respect, more than 70 nationalities were identified. Most of the passengers are from the United States, followed by Germany, Australia, China, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland and Netherlands, among others. Percentages are presented in Figure 4. 
As regards Measure 15 (2009), adopted in the XXXII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which recommends a ratio of one guide every 20 passengers, it has been possible to identify expedition staff members who may be included either on the crew or on the passenger lists. Keeping a direct relationship with passengers, staff members perform different roles, such as expedition leaders, naturalist guides and lecturers, and are in charge of leading passengers during the landing activities. For this reason, only staff members on board vessels that carry up to 500 passengers have been considered. Most voyages, expedition staff is included on the passenger manifest and, in second place, they are included in the crew manifest; in some cases they are listed on both and in other cases staff is not specified (See Table 4). In this respect, it is worth mentioning that their position on board is stated only when they are on the crew manifest.

Table 5 shows an overview of tour operators, their domicile, ships, ship owners, ship management companies and registers for the 2012/2013 season. A total of 24 tour operators operated Antarctica from Ushuaia: 22 are located in countries which are Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and United States) and 2 in one country which is not a Consultative Party (Canada). Besides, there are other companies and organizations that subchartered vessels and/or booked cabins and made one or more voyages to Antarctica. 
According to the registers of vessels that operated Antarctica throughout this season from Ushuaia, it may be observed, on the one hand, that 4 are Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (France, Netherlands, Norway and Russian Federation) and, on the other, that 7 are not an Antarctic Treaty Party (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia, Malta, Marshall Islands and Union of the Comoros) (See Figure 5).
