SAR-WG: Agreement between the Chilean Maritime Authorities and Maritime New Zealand for Maritime Search and Rescue Coordination Services


1.0 	Introduction

In the years 2008 and 2009, in Valparaíso and Buenos Aires respectively, the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) carried out two workshops called “Towards Improved Search and Rescue Coordination and Response in the Antarctica”. 

The result of these workshops identified the following needs:

    • That the five countries with SAR jurisdiction in Antarctica pursue bilateral SAR agreements, for maritime as well as aviation aspects.

    • Encourage vessels navigating in the areas of responsibility of the countries with SAR jurisdiction to daily report their position to the corresponding Search and Rescue Coordination Centers.

    • Encourage the countries that have SAR boundaries in Antarctica to continuously exchange information with the aim of improving a surface picture that is as real as possible.

Considering the above, New Zealand and Chilean MRCC’s signed an Agreement during the Tenth Asia-Pacific Heads of Maritime Safety Agencies Forum, on June 1st, 2009, which was subscribed between the Maritime Authorities of both countries. 

2.0 	Agreements Reached

Each Maritime Search and Rescue Coordination Center, within its field of action, has sought to:

    • Exchange SAR information related to real situations or to a surface picture of interest within their own maritime SAR regions, in order to render efficient assistance, in case of distress;

    • Provide mutual assistance, as far as possible, when performing SAR missions in their own Search and Rescue Areas, mainly along their common boundaries;

    • Take actions to facilitate the entrance of units that develop SAR tasks to the Search and Rescue Area of the other State and the use of facilities in the corresponding countries while they participate in a SAR mission in the SAR area of responsibility of the neighbor country;

    • Exchange information on the current available SAR resources, so each country knows the SAR capabilities of the other;

    • Perform trials of the communication links with the other country, at least once a month, with the aim of ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the SAR communication links;

    • Periodically perform maritime SAR exercises, to check the response capability of both organizations and the capability to perform a joint search and rescue operation within the Search and Rescue Areas of Chile and New Zealand;

    • Periodically hold meetings to agree on the criteria regarding the exchange of SAR experiences of both organization, mainly those related to the procedures to render assistance and rescue in case of major accidents, such as those involving passenger ships in Antarctica, or in case of emergencies in the maritime boundary of both countries.

3.0 	Lessons Learned / Experiences

In relation to the previous, during the three years this Agreement has been executed, the following advantages have been demonstrated:

    • An interrelation among the Coordination Centers, which allows prompt communications that, in turn, benefit the operations being performed. 

    • A mutual cooperation that is essential in SAR operations and in those related to nautical sports, such as the activities that take place in summer, by monitoring the yachts participating in races, like the Volvo Ocean Race, Vendee Globe, Barcelona Ocean Race, etc. 

    • Confirm the excellent coordination levels and the information exchange beyond the matters usually handled by the Search and Rescue Coordination Centers.


4.0 	Conclusions

This agreement is the result of a long process of experience and mutual cooperation within the Search and Rescue field, where both countries have acknowledged the need to ensure an effective and efficient service in those matters.

It has also allowed for the reciprocal knowledge of the operational capabilities of the New Zealand and Chilean MRCC’s, as neighbors, in their own Search and Rescue Areas that together cover a broad part of the Pacific Ocean (they are the fourth and fifth broadest areas of the world) and where the Antarctica is included.

Finally, the coordination of the Search and Rescue operations between the New Zealand and Chilean MRCC’s becomes even more important when considering the benefits of this kind of Agreements for the safeguarding of the human life at sea.
