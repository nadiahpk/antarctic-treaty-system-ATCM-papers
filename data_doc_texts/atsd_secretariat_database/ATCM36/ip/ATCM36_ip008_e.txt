Annex VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: United Kingdom’s Implementing Legislation
Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom


Further to discussions at ATCM XXXIV (Final Report paragraphs 167-170) about the potential usefulness of Parties’ sharing their implementing legislation for approving Annex VI of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Liability Annex) this Information Paper appends the United Kingdom’s recently finalised Antarctic Act 2013, and related Explanatory Notes. 

The Antarctic Act 2013 implements the Liability Annex for the UK, and also updates the existing Antarctic Act 1994 to enable implementation of the changes to Annex II of the Protocol, as agreed at ATCM XXXII.   The Act also resolves a technical question regarding the effect of devolution within the UK, which has enabled the UK also to approve Measure 15(2009), which the UK was already implementing through the permitting regime established under the Antarctic Act 1994.  

The UK has therefore now approved all current Recommendations and Measures adopted under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.
