Information paper submitted by ASOC1
Abstract
This paper provides significant updates from The Future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet: Observed and Predicted Changes, Tipping Points, and Policy Considerations (IP07 at ATME on Climate Change 2010). Our key conclusions are:
    1. The Antarctic Ice Sheets are losing mass, and this loss is accelerating.
    2. Widespread glacier retreat may already be set in motion.
    3. Changes to WAIS are happening now and are related to anthropogenic climate change. Also, WAIS is just part of the global sea level rise story.
    4. WAIS is likely to survive mostly intact for this century, but a “collapse,” if and when it happens, will raise sea level at least 3 meters.
    5. In light of uncertain science, expert elicitation methods have improved, which suggest a much higher contribution from polar ice sheets than suggested from present models.
    6. A West Antarctic Tipping Point threshold is likely to exist, though the science is not settled. WAIS can disintegrate more quickly than the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Overview
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is one of the key scientific puzzles in projecting future climate change and its consequences. It holds a potential 3.3-6 meters of global sea level rise (Alley and Whillans 1991, Bamber et al. 2009, Lythe et al. 2001). It is also inherently unstable because it is grounded on a bed well below sea level: the majority of all other ice sheets are grounded on land above sea level.  Glaciologists understand the non-dynamic, linear contribution of WAIS to sea level rise fairly well—that is, the minor melting of the WAIS surface that returns to the sea each year. Less understood are the dynamics and potential for what is called a rapid disintegration (or collapse) of WAIS, a nonlinear process whereby the ice sheet would flow at increasing rates into the ocean as it buttressing ice shelves diminished. 
Trying to determine the likelihood of rapid disintegration has been enormously difficult. In the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007), the assessors decided to include the small linear contribution of WAIS to global sea level rise projections, but opted to leave out any dynamical processes such as disintegration because the underlying processes were not understood. This was highly controversial, particularly in light of emerging research suggesting that parts of WAIS were already beginning to disintegrate (O’Reilly et al., 2012). 
The Working Group I Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC will be published in September 2013, which we anticipate will contain more specific projections on sea level rise that attempt to include WAIS dynamical processes. In the interim, researchers have made steps forward in understanding the past, present, and future of the ice sheet. This paper surveys new findings since our last report on WAIS, titled The Future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet: Observed and Predicted Changes, Tipping Points, and Policy Considerations (IP07 at ATME on Climate Change 2010). 
Most recent research documents that WAIS is changing more significantly and rapidly than the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC considered. After we review the science, we will provide policy recommendations related to the future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, since its disintegration will have local implications as well as global ones.
Findings
The Antarctic Ice Sheets are losing mass, and this loss is accelerating. 
The use of gravity measurements coupled with general satellite observations of the Earth’s ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland have transformed the way we consider ice sheets and both the magnitude and time scale of changes in ice sheet mass balance. Before continental-scale gravity measurements, the Antarctic ice sheets were assumed to have a positive mass balance; that is, that they were decreasing sea level rise due to snow accumulation on the ice sheets. This understanding has been overturned in recent years (Rignot et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2009, Velicogna et al. 2009). Rignot et al. 2011 use gravity based measurements coupled with ice sheet perimeter loss from net accumulation and confirm that the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets are losing mass, and that this loss has been accelerating over the past 18 years.
Widespread glacier retreat may already be set in motion.
Ice shelves form over the water and serve as buttresses for the ice sheets. Pritchard et al. (2012) note that while not all ice shelves are thinning, those that are (20 of the 54 in their sample) are thinning through basal melting. That is: much of the melting is occurring on the underside of the ice shelves. They found that the highest thinning rates occur where the ice shelves interact with the warmest water, which is influenced by wind forcing, ocean upwelling, and atmospheric warming (502). Pritchard et al. conclude with a discussion about the timescales involved in this changes, suggesting that retreat is set in motion: “the most profound contemporary changes to the ice sheets and their contribution to sea level rise can be attributed to ocean thermal forcing that is sustained over decades and may already have triggered a period of unstable glacier retreat” (484, using Joughin et al 2010, Schoof 2007).
Changes to WAIS are happening now and are related to anthropogenic climate change. Also, WAIS is just part of the global sea level rise story.
Steig et al. (2013) have found that West Antarctica is warming. Previously to this publication, only the Antarctic Peninsula was thought to be experiencing temperature increases. As the air warms and atmospheric circulations intensify, changes to the ice are expected to occur. 
Pike et al. (2013) used diatom geochemistry and ecology to reconstruct Holocene glacial discharge and the oceanic environment on the Antarctic Peninsula. They found that increased El Nina events and summer insolation (solar radiation), rather than oceanic processes, had the most effect on ice sheet change. It is important to note the time scales here, however: summer insolation effects will occur slowly while a warming ocean will have more direct and immediate impacts.
The Kamb Ice Stream in the Ross Sea sector of WAIS has been nearly stagnant over most of its length, unlike the rapid flow of the other nearby ice streams, for almost two centuries. A model that focuses on subglacial hydrology by van der Wel et al. suggests that the Kamb Ice Stream may return to flowing sometime this century (2012), an event that could rapidly increase the WAIS contribution to sea level.
Hillenbrand et al. (2012) reconstructed grounding line retreat in the Amundsen Sea Embayment from about 100,000 years BP. They found that past grounding line retreat was either consistently slow or that fast grounding line retreat was extremely short lived. The implications for the present are that the significant, contemporary changes observed in Pine Island Bay “may be exceptional during the Holocene and may originate in changes in regional climate, ocean circulation, or ice-sheet dynamics” (2012). That is, the paleo record of the ice sheet does not line up with current ice sheet behavior, suggesting that anthropogenic effects may be playing a significant role in contemporary changes.
Looking at long term, multi-century sea level rise from all sources, Foster and Rohling (2013) considered the ramifications of CO2 stabilizing at 400-450 ppm, as well as the ramifications of our current atmospheric measure of carbon dioxide—392ppm as of 2011. In both instances, the authors expressed that it is likely (68% confidence) that this warming will generate a long term sea level rise of at least 9 meters.
In a major multi-model study, Bindschadler et al. (in press) analyze all ten of the ice sheet models involved in providing sea level rise projections for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This study is significant because a) it is among the first to synthesize model findings on dynamical ice sheet behavior to some extent and b) it breaks down the contributions between Greenland and Antarctica. Bindschadler et al. find that, when they run these models with the IPCC’s RCP8.5 scenarioi, Greenland contributes 22.3 cm (range of 62 cm) and Antarctica contributes 8.1cm (range of 14cm) to global sea level rise over the next century. When the experiment extends to 200 years from now, Greenland and Antarctica’s sea level rise contributions are 53.2 and 26.7 cm, respectively, with ranges of 79 and 43 cm. 
WAIS is likely to survive mostly intact for this century, but a “collapse,” if and when it happens, will raise sea level at least 3 meters.
While changes are occurring now, the overall stability of WAIS seems likely in the short term (Joughin and Alley 2011). Nonetheless, experts do not agree on the likelihood nor the rate of a rapid disintegration if or when it occurs. The expected sea level rise generated from a WAIS disintegration will create profound impacts on global infrastructure and society. 
In light of uncertain science, expert elicitation methods have improved, which suggest a much higher contribution from polar ice sheets than suggested from present models.
In situations where scientific data is uncertain, a method called expert elicitation may be useful. Expert elicitation asks scientists to follow a structured approach to subjective consensus-making called “opinion pooling.” Bamber and Aspinall (2013) build upon a previous expert elicitation study on sea level rise (Bamber et al. 2009) to try to estimate future ice sheet contributions to sea level in the next century and to ascertain if expert opinion had changed in the past few years. This study suggested that expert opinion had not changed very much since the 2010 study (a correlation of 0.998). This is perhaps because WAIS experts have a firmer understanding of what is missing from the ice sheet models at this point, particularly how to incorporate the processes responsible for rapid ice loss.
The median estimated contribution of all ice sheets for this century was 0.29 m, with the 95th percentile at 0.84 m. This expert elicitation estimate is much higher that the numbers given in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (2007), which provided an estimate sea level rise of 0.18-0.59 m from all sources, though this excluded dynamical changes in the ice sheets. Bamber and Aspinal conclude with the remarks that uncertainty was high for these estimates, but that their findings fall in between the low projections of the IPCC report and the higher estimates of semi-empirical studies (i.e., Pfeffer et al., Rahmstorf 2007, Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009).
A West Antarctic Tipping Point threshold is likely to exist, though the science is not settled. WAIS can disintegrate more quickly than the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Is there a temperature threshold which, when crossed, forms the “point of no return” for WAIS disintegration? The notion of a tipping point is compelling because it provides a specific target to avoid in order to keep WAIS stable for now. However, it is important to note that there may be more complexity involved in “tipping” the ice sheet into disintegration, including temperature changes, oceanic changes, and the internal behavior of the ice sheet. This complexity may render the idea of a WAIS tipping point virtually useless. Also, it is possible that we have already crossed the threshold that ensures a disintegration of WAIS. 
Previous research suggested a range of tipping points for WAIS at 1-5°C of global warming (Hansen et al. 2008, Keller et al. 2005, Kopp et al. 2009, Kriegler et al, 2009 , Lenton et al. 2008, Mercer 1978). Over the past century, the planet has warmed about .74°C (IPCC, 2007: 5). 
More recently, scholars in applied mathematics have been attempting to test how well the notion of “tipping points” can work to predict catastrophic events. Using reconstituted time-series of past events and Lenton’s list of tipping elements in the climate system (2008), Thompson and Sieber (2011) employ bifurcation theory to explain nonlinear climate events. Bifurcations are “points in the slow evolution of a system at which qualitative changes of even sudden jumps of behavior can occur” (404).  One of Lenton’s tipping elements is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; Lenton considers a WAIS disintegration possible this century (2008). Thompson and Sieber label WAIS as a “possible bifurcation” and note that “rapid sea level rise (of greater than one meter per century) is more likely to come from the WAIS than from the Greenland ice-sheet” (414). 
By applying bifurcation theory to past climate events, Thompson and Sieber find that “prediction is often remarkably good but is not always reliable” (420). We hope that fine tuning models to more consistently depict nonlinear dynamical processes such as WAIS disintegration helps us more completely characterize potential tipping points for WAIS and other elements of the earth’s systems.  
Conclusion: Policy Implications
1.	Climate policy requires an “all hands on deck” approach. ASOC encourages the Antarctic Treaty System to take concrete steps toward being a carbon neutral continent. This includes designing and retrofitting bases for maximum energy efficiency and energy generation through on-site, sustainable sources such as wind or solar.
2.	The scientific work being conducted in Antarctica is critically important to our understanding of global climate change. ASOC encourages continued strong support of these efforts.
3.	Teams of experts are not always immediately available to observe localized, rapid changes in ice shelves and sheets. ASOC supports rapid response plans for documenting ice changes and other environmental events, such as the implementation of temporary MPAs in areas of imminent or occurring ice shelf collapse to facilitate targeted research.
4. 	It is imperative for the ATS to play a more active role in the global climate change dialogue and for the latest scientific evidence from Antarctica to be made available to policy makers globally on a timely basis. SCAR has started doing some useful work along these lines, but the ATS (through regular missives from the ATCM and CCAMLR) also have an important role to play.
