New infrastructure facilities of the Russian Antarctic Expedition
The “Strategy for the development of the Russian Federation’s activities in the Antarctic”, approved by the Government of the Russian Federation on 30 October 2010, envisaged measures for further development of the infrastructure of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) (WP-55, 34 ATCM). The Plan of Actions for fulfilling provisions of the Strategy for 2012 included complete construction of the snow-ice runway and of the new wintering complex at Progress station and construction and introduction into operation of the new research expedition vessel the “Akademik Tryoshnikov” for RAE.
Construction of the runway and of the new wintering complex was necessitated by provision of safety of RAE transport operations in the Antarctic. Beginning from 1956, the major base of the inland sledge-tractor traverses (STT) of the Russian (Soviet) Antarctic Expedition was the first Soviet Antarctic Mirny station, situated on the shore of the Davis Sea. A typical feature of the initial stage of this route was a large number of deep cracks in the glacier in the area of the initial rise of its vertical profile. In end of the 20th – beginning of the 21st century, the area of spreading of glacial cracks and their size began to intensively increase, resulting in several transport incidents and the death of one of RAE participants in 2008. So it was decided to transfer the transport base of the inland STT to a safer place where one of RAE stations was located. This was Progress station on the coast of Prydz Bay of the Commonwealth Sea in the Larsemann Hills Oasis. Here in December 1986, the SAE seasonal field base was opened, which was assigned the status of the year-round operating station. At first it was to be used for organization of geological-geophysical studies in the Prince Charles Mountains and the adjoining territory, located under the ice sheet. Since 2003, it was used for carrying out the year-round monitoring programs of the state of the magnetosphere, surface layer of the atmosphere and state of coastal water and ice of Prydz Bay. The decision about the construction of new RAE infrastructure facilities was made by the Government of the Russian Federation on 24 September 2001. The design work on these facilities began in 2002 and in late 2003, the RAE started construction of the station facilities. On 31 December 2012, all work was finished and RAE has received the most modern Antarctic station and the snow-ice runway, the operation of which significantly extends the logistical capabilities of conducting seasonal expedition operations.  
The new station complex includes the following facilities:
    1) The office-living three-storey building, intended for accommodation of 50 people (25 people during wintering with each person provided with a single living room).The building houses five scientific laboratories (meteorological, “wet” and “dry” oceanographic, for satellite information receiving and analysis, geophysical and hydrobiological), station office, radio-information hub, medical block, galley with food storehouses, mess-room, gym, bath-house (sauna), toilets and shower cubicles. 
    2) The radio-electronic observation unit for monitoring the parameters of satellite constellation orbits of GLONASS navigation system, geodetic monitoring of the tectonic Earth’s crust movements from GPS and GLONASS satellite systems, geomagnetic pavilion, radar for monitoring the state of coastal ice and icebergs, and air traffic control of helicopters and low-flying airplanes.  
    3) A complex of technical-power supply consisting of a diesel-electric power station with a total capacity of 900 kW, garage for repair and placement of up to 8 transporters, automatic boiler for heating office-living premises of the station using waste fuel-lubricant materials, a complex of water treatment, including water distillers, a complex of purifying and utilization of all sewage water from station facilities, repair shops, equipped with the required machinery.
    4) The tank farm for storage of diesel and aviation fuel, consisting of fifteen 75 m3 double-walled  containers with necessary pumping and auxiliary utilities, special rack for storage of fuel-lubricants in drums, special helipad for fuel delivery by means of helicopters, and a fuel pipe to the DES building. 
    5) A helipad equipped with illumination, navigation and flight control devices.
    6) The snow-ice airfield intended for takeoff and landing of heavy wheeled airplanes with the runway 3000 m long and 60 m wide. The airfield complex also includes four installations on sleds with a possibility of their relocation for preventing snowdrifts. This complex consists of a self-contained diesel electric power station, air-traffic control house equipped with weather station, all types of communication, including access to the Internet, computer communication with the station for information transmission, living complex, intended for accommodation of 6 people with a mess-room and a small galley for 12 people and of the automated weather station at the distant end of the airfield. 
The Progress station is equipped with a safety system for personnel and transport by means of which all motions of transporters and people within 100 km can be tracked on the computer screen. 
The introduction into operation of the aforementioned facilities at Progress station has allowed us to establish on its basis the most important RAE center of seasonal logistical operations and scientific studies. Since 2008, the CTT are annually (twice for a season) made from this station  at the route Progress – Vostok – Progress for technical resupply of the inland station and for undertaking specialized glaciological, geophysical and geodetic studies (at the way back to Progress station) in the central regions of East Antarctica. For this purpose, 9-12 transporters of the type Kassbohrer “Polar-300” and the necessary trailing equipment including living shacks, fuel containers and cargo platforms, which are installed on sleds with a special cover to improve sliding, are based at Progress station. The field camp Progress-1 (at the route from the station to the airfield) serves as a place for formation of traverses. In the same area there is a cryosphere testing ground for investigating the variability of characteristics of the permafrost layer. A borehole was drilled at its center 80 m deep, equipped with sensors to measure the permafrost parameters over the entire vertical column. The large-size cargo is delivered from board the ship by landfast ice in Thala Bay, where the field camp Progress-4 was set up on the coast. There is an exit from this place to the ice dome to the airfield location. The seasonal oceanographic and hydrobiologic studies are carried out in Nella Bay. For this, the field camp Progress-2 was created at the Biologicheskaya Spit. 
At the boundary of the Oasis with the ice dome, a field camp is located for support of the airborne geophysical studies of the area of Lambert Glacier - Amery Ice Shelf. It has equipped places for accommodation of the crew of AN-2 airplane, personnel of the aviation-geophysical team and additional personnel.
In addition to the wintering team, Progress station is capable today to accommodate up to 75 people of the seasonal team, i.e., the total number of people at the station can be 100 persons. 
Progress station is provided with Russian TV receiving, Internet access and all types of communication. 
Another new facility of the RAE infrastructure is the new research expedition vessel the “Akademik Tryoshnikov”. The issues of the technical-economical justification for construction of this vessel were first formulated by the Government of the Russian Federation in the Decision of 24 September 2001. The design work began on 8 September 2005 and was completed on 1 June 2007. The construction of the ship began at the enterprise “Admiralty Shipyards” in St. Petersburg on 1 December 2008. On 10 October 2012, the national flag of the Russian Federation was hoisted onboard the ship that was called the “Akademik Tryoshnikov”. 
Main technical characteristics of the ship:
    • length overall 133.6 m;
    • breadth overall 23.0 m;
    • side height 13.5 m;
    • draft 8.2 m;
    • displacement 16160 tons;
    • speed 16.0 knots;
    • power plant – diesel-electric of three aggregates;
    • total power – 16800 kW;
    • propulsion machinery – 2 fixed pitch propellers;
    • ice performance at a speed of 2 knots – 1.1 m;
    • endurance at a speed of 14 knots – 15000 nautical miles;
    • endurance by fuel 45 days;
    • capacity - 140 people, including 60 people of the crew and 80 people of the expedition;
    • type of ship helicopters – Ка 32С – three helicopters.
The R/V “Akademik Tryoshnikov” is equipped with the most modern scientific equipment, allowing comprehensive studies of all natural environments of the global ocean from the ionosphere to the lithosphere of the sea floor. The most interesting equipment includes: a hydro-acoustic complex consisting of a multi-beam echo-sounder allowing one to obtain a three-dimensional picture of the seabed and a profiler of bottom sediments, which determines the structure of bottom sediments to a thickness of 300 m. The vessel is equipped with a unique ice research complex, which determines not only the sea ice characteristics along the ship transit route, but also the physical-mechanical ice loads on the ship hull. This makes it possible to collect various data on the ice navigation conditions in the Southern Ocean and contribute to addressing the design goals for construction of new ice-class vessels and offshore structures experiencing ice loads. In total the vessel has 11 laboratories with modern measurement complexes. In addition, the R/V “Akademik Tryoshnikov” is equipped with four module laboratories of container type, which are connected with all necessary engineering ship services (fresh and sea water, electrical power supply, sewage collection system, telephone and computer communication). So these laboratories have a possibility under the coastal conditions to be fully stocked with specific research equipment, which is absent at present on the ship. This significantly expands the capabilities for scientific studies and creates the necessary preconditions for scientific-technical progress in further ship studies.
On 21 December 2012, the R/V “Akademik Tryoshnikov” departed for her first experimental Antarctic cruise, which aimed to carry out full-scale trials of the ship seaworthiness and ice performance, logistical supply and rotation of personnel of the Russian Bellingshausen station and en-route meteorological, oceanographic, hydrobiological and glaciological studies of Antarctic waters. With the second vessel at its disposal, the RAE will transfer to a different arrangement of the expedition operation for executing the provisions of the Strategy. The R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov” will operate in the Pacific Ocean sector of the Antarctic between the Russian Bellingshausen station and the seasonal field base Leningradskaya and the R.V “Akademik Fedorov” will focus her efforts in the Indian Ocean sector between the Russian Mirny and Novolazarevskaya stations.  
Putting into operation the complex of Progress station and the R/V “Akademik Tryoshnikov” significantly expands the scope of RAE activities and ensures achievement of its objectives in accordance with the main provisions of the Strategy.
