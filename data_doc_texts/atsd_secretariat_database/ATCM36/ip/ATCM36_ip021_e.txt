Initial Environmental Evaluation for the Construction of Inland Summer Camp, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica







Initial Environmental Evaluation for the Construction of Inland Summer Camp, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica

Non-technical summary
This Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) is based on the Annex I (Article 2) of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and relevant domestic laws or regulations. It has been carried out by Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA), which is affiliated to State Oceanic Administration (SOA) of China, for the proposed construction and operation and delivered to the CEP according to the Article 6 of Annex I. 
The proposed Antarctic inland summer camp in Princess Elizabeth Land of the Antarctic ice sheet is located at 76º58´29″E, 73º51´50″S. It is located at site with travelling distance of 522 km far from the Zhongshan Station, 715 km from the Kunlun Station, and 85 km from the Grove Mountains. The proposed area is flat and open with an attitude of 2620 m. The ice thickness is around 1900 m, and the bottom of the ice sheet shows no sign of melting. The density of the surface snow is 0.44±0.03 g/cm3, and the snow accumulation rate is 3.72 cm/a. The annual average temperature is -35.44℃ and the annual average wind speed is 5.5 m/s. Plants or animals are absent around the 100 km range of the area.
The main purpose of the camp is to provide relay support of logistics for the investigation of the Kunlun Station and Grove Mountains, to provide emergency rescue protection for inland research activities in east Antarctica, and to support local observation of glaciology, meteorology, geophysics and aviation remote sensing in the east Antarctic ice sheet. 
The camp construction area takes up about 300 m2. Construction period is 6 to 8 weeks. High efficiency, energy saving, security, environmental protection and recycling are main consideration for the camp design. Non-permanent jack-up or portable structure are designed, to avoid that buildings buried by snow or building materials remained when disassembly. Domestic pre-assembling and field assembly form are adopted, to avoid the on-site material processing. New materials and new techniques are applied, to minimize volume and weight of building materials. Low energy consumption, high efficiency of the facilities and equipment are utilized as much as possible, to reduce energy consumption in a maximum extent. Required energy equipment will apply the highest emission and environmental standards. Clean fossil fuels and renewable energy sources such as wind power and photovoltaic power are utilized. All the solid wastes will be classified, separately packed and brought back to the Zhongshan Station. The sewage will be treated with efficient membrane and reused, while all the thick liquid will be brought back to the Zhongshan Station. 
With the logistical support provided mainly by inland fleet vehicles, the proposed summer camp can supply up to 5 people for 60 days’ accommodation and work, and another 25 people for an average of 4 days’ accommodation per capita during the summer season. The design service life of the proposed camp is 10 years.
This IEE systematically describes the proposed activities and the local natural environment, makes comprehensive identification and evaluation of potential environmental impact factors, optimizes the design scheme, and formulates the measures of the prevention and mitigation of the environmental impact. Due to the small scale of the project, short period of construction and operation, small number of workers, low air pollutants emission intensity, low amount of the sewage and solid wastes (removed out of the camp), low risk of the potential fuel leakage,  low environmental impact of the noise and light pollution, and reasonable and effective prevention and mitigation actions, the environmental effect  on the Antarctic during the camp construction and operation is no more than a minor or transitory.
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The summer camp is used mainly to provide terrestrial and aerial relay support for the inland expeditions of east Antarctica, and carry out some local scientific observations. Specific contents include:
(1) To provide terrestrial and aviation relay support for the expedition in the region of Dome A (Chinese Kunlun Station) and Grove Mountains; 
(2) To provide emergency rescue protection for research activities by China and other countries in the inland of east Antarctica; 
(3) To support local observation of glaciology, meteorology, geophysics and aerial remote sensing in the inland of east Antarctica.
1.2 Functions
The new camp will be operated only in the austral summer (from middle December to middle February). There are four main functions:
(1) Ground transportation and relay support: with infrastructure conditions for personal resting, material reservation and transportation;
(2) Aviation security support: meteorological safeguard and ground facility support of aircraft transitions and refuelling for the activities such as long flight between the Zhongshan Station and the Kunlun Station;
(3) Emergency rescue and safeguard: personnel emergency evacuation, inland fleet vehicles emergent maintenance and aircraft emergency alternating;
(4) Automatic scientific observation.
1.3 Legislation
Full references have been considered for the preparation of this IEE. These references include some international public laws such as the Antarctic Treaty System, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, the Protocol of the International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) and the Convention on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea, as well as China’s relevant laws and regulations. 
1.3.1 International laws, standards and guidelines
The Antarctic Treaty (1959) came into force in 1961. Its measures, resolutions and decisions and a series of conventions relevant to Antarctica have shaped up the Antarctic Treaty System. China acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and obtained its consultative party status in 1985. China ratified the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1994. Compiling and submission of this IEE is an act of China to implement her obligations under the Protocol.
The international conventions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (1993) ,the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change (2005), the Protocol of the International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships((MARPOL 73/78) and the Convention on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea(1975), to which China has become a contracting party, have established in different aspects the requirements for environmental protection and sustainable development and have become important bases for the development of the IEE for the construction and operation of the Chinese new summer camp.
The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) are two international organizations involved in the Antarctic affairs. They have developed a series of relevant guidelines and documents regarding the activities in Antarctica. Among them, the draft IEE has made reference mainly to the Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning (COMNAP, 1992), the Environmental Monitoring Manual in Antarctic (COMNAP, 2000), the Technical Standards for Environmental Monitoring in Antarctica (COMNAP, 2000), the Practical Guidelines for the Development and Design of Environmental Monitoring Programs (COMNAP, 2005b) and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (COMNAP/ATCM, 2005a), etc.
1.3.2 Domestic laws, standards and guidelines
The construction and operation of camp will enforce strictly relevant domestic environmental laws, standards as well as environmental guidelines such as PRC Law on Environmental Protection, PRC Law on Marine Environmental Protection, PRC Law on Environmental Impact Assessment, PRC Law on energy saving, PRC Law on Renewable Energy, National Scheme for Emergent Environmental Incident, Regulations Concerning Environmental Monitoring Management, PRC Standards on Surface Water Environmental Quality (GB3838-2002), Urban technology policy of sewage treatment and pollution control, Water Quality Standards for Using Regenerated Water for Urban Miscellaneous Uses (GB/T18920-2002), PRC Technical Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment-Principals, etc.
 Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA) develop a series of measures and standards for the management of the operation of the camp in order to guarantee the safe and effective operation of the camp. The measures and standards will minimize the risks in Antarctic expedition and environmental impacts.
1.4 Policy on the proposed activity
Under the direct leadership of SOA, CAA takes responsibility for coordination, and the Polar Research Institute of China (PRIC) responses for the new camp construction. 
The new camp is expected to be established in the summer of 2013/2014. CAA is responsible for the planning of the follow-up scientific researches and logistic support. PRIC is responsible for the logistical management, maintenance of the camp as well as organization and implementation of environmental monitoring projects.
2. Principle characteristics of the proposed activity
2.1 Location
The proposed site (76º58´27″E, 73º51´50″S) is on the Princess Elizabeth Land, which is located on the research traverse from the Zhongshan Station to Kunlun Station (Fig 2-1). The altitude of the proposed site is 2620 m and the thickness of the ice sheet is over 1900 m. The travelling distance from the proposed site to the Zhongshan Station is 522 km, to the Kunlun Station is 715 km, and the proposed site is 85 km far from the Grove Mountains. The surface topography at the proposed site is flat and open. The measurement shows that the snow density is 0.44 ± 0.03 g/cm3 and annual average temperature is -35.44 degree.

Fig.2-1   Proposed location of the new summer camp
2.2 Disturbed areas
The disturbed areas include camp construction site, material storing area, the route between the Zhongshan Station and the proposed site. 
Once the camp is put into operation, the disturbed areas will be the buildings and facilities of the camp, and some observatory sites around the camp. However, the total disturbed area will be no more than 1 km2. Additional disturbances include annual long-distance transportation from the Zhongshan Station to the proposed site, the transportation of a few personnel and small amounts of cargo by fixed wing plane in the future. Meanwhile, the waste removal from the camp will also cause disturbance.
2.3 Time schedule
Required materials and construction personnel will be transported from Shanghai in November 2013, arrived at the Zhongshan Station in early December and the proposed camp in late December. Construction will be completed from January to February 2014. All the personnel’s accommodation, electricity supply and other logistical support during the construction will be provided by the inland fleet vehicles. All the sewage and solid waste during the construction will be brought back to the Zhongshan Station with inland fleet vehicles, and retreat according to the relative management regulations of the Zhongshan Station.
2.4 Transportation
During the construction and operation stages of the camp, both personnel and cargoes will be shipped from China to the Zhongshan Station by the R/V Xuelong, and then be transported from the Station to the proposed site by the inland fleet vehicles. For the inland transportation, not only the capability, safety and cost, but also environmental impacts are taken into consideration. After the camp is put into operation, some scientific researchers and equipment will be transported to the proposed camp by fixed wing planes.
2.5 Construction activities
2.5.1 Construction activities
Because the camp is built on the ice sheet surface in a low temperature environment, all the buildings are adopted away of domestic prefabrication and on-site assembly. All building components are pre-assembled at home, and then transported to the Zhongshan Station by R/V Xuelong. They will be transported to the proposed site with inland fleet vehicles and assembled on-site.
2.5.2 Accommodation
During the construction period, the construction personnel will be no more than 25 people. All the personnel accommodate in the moving tank of the inland fleet vehicles.
2.5.3 Camp structure
Proposed camp area is about 300 square meters with full consideration of the function such as relay support, emergency rescue and scientific observation.  The main modules of the camp include sleeping, living, scientific observation, storage, water supply, waste water treatment and solid waste treatment (table2-1).

2.5.6 Water supply and drainage system
The design principle of water supply and drainage system is: (1) to minimize the impact on the environment, transport the waste water and solid waste out of the Antarctic as much as possible; (2) to make rational layout, and reduce the occupation of land; (3) to run safely, to manage and operate easily, and with better self-control level.
    (1) Water supply
The maximum accommodation capacity design of proposed summer camp is 30 people, including resident 5 people for 60 days, and 25 people are only shortly stay and are expected with an average of 4 days per capita. The summer maximum of daily water usage is of 405 L/d (Table 2-6), and normal daily water consumption is of 67.5 L/d (Table 2-7). Snow melt pool and water supply pump are designed according to the maximum daily water consumption.

    (2) Water drainage
Small amount of water is consumed each summer. Upon the consideration of environmental protection, easy management and simplification of treatment facilities, a negative pressure free-of-flushing system will be used in the toilet to reduce the capacity of black water. The human excrements (including night soil and urine) will be packed automatically and sent back to the Zhongshan Station for further treatment. The lower contaminated waste water filtered through super-filtration can be turned as intermediate water for cleaning, through further treatment by a reverse osmosis system, the treated water will be in compliance with the standards of Category II of Surface Water in China (GB 3838-2002) and be recycled for simple cleaning of clothes in the camp. 
    (3) Process of waste water treatment
The new camp will set up a new system for deep sewage treatment and recycling. The system consists of sewage tank, reactor tank, out-tank pump valve and filters, etc. It is a sealed unit made of stainless steel plate and can operate automatically (continuously or intermittently). One person might be appointed to make routine inspection and maintenance of this system. Residual black water comes from super-filtering unit and reverse osmosis unit will flow into a combined rector, where water will precipitate and flocculate. The upper clear water in this combined rector will flow back to low pollutant water tank. The filtering core will be changed when the effectiveness drops. The sewage treatment and recycling system will be installed in a space of 3700 mm×2700 mm×2400 mm as an integrated unit. The process of treatment and recycling of the sewage is given as following (Figure 2-4).

Fig. 2-4 Process of sewage treatment and recycling
2.5.7 Waste management
A Waste Management Plan (WMP) will be drawn up that will comply with all the requirements of Annex III of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The plan will comprise waste reduction, storage and disposal, removal of treated waste out of Antarctica, products prohibited in Antarctica, as well as the training and education on environment protection to the expeditioners. 
The WMP will consist of two parts. The first part will cover the management of the waste produced during the construction of the camp and the associated activities. The second part will cover the management of the waste produced during the on-going operation of the camp. The WMP will be reviewed regularly and updated timely.
    (1) Municipal waste
The camp will practise a waste classification management system. At the camp, the wastes will be classified and stored separately in different cans. All of the wastes will be removed from the camp to the Zhongshan Station or brought back to China for further treatment after the summer operation. 
All the wastes will be classified into four categories: recoverable wastes, organic wastes, hazardous wastes and unrecoverable wastes. They will be stored in different rubbish containers, respectively. The recoverable wastes will be classified further into 9 categories: plastic, rubber, metals, glass, paper, textiles, bamboo or wooden articles, and discarded units of electrical appliances. The organic wastes mainly come from food and they will be sealed and stored timely. The hazardous wastes will be further classified into the used batteries, light tubes and other harmful wastes. The amount of unclassified wastes will be controlled to a minimum amount. These wastes will be sealed and stored timely by a person special in charge of this work when the can is full up. All the human excretions will be packed and brought back to the Zhongshan Station for further treatment. The waste water will be treated and recycled as much as possible, and the limited residual treated water will be transported out of Antarctica. After the summer operation, the waste container will be transported back to the Zhongshan Station by the inland fleet vehicles, and then brought back to China by R/V Xuelong. Additionally, the transport boxes are designed to be easy moved out of the container for relocation when necessary. Packing material should be minimized as much as possible in the process of logistic preparation so as to reduce the production and transportation of the waste. A garbage compactor will be used to compact the solid waste when necessary.
    (2) Fuel and oil drums 
Storage tanks will be reused when through the quality inspection, and the empty tanks will be brought back to the Zhongshan Station by the inland fleet vehicles.
Fuel barrels adopt international standard with a volume of 208 L. At the end of each summer, empty barrels will be crushed and brought back to the Zhongshan Station by inland transportation fleet vehicles, and finally transported back to China.
    (3) Hazardous wastes
Purchase and usage of hazardous products will be strictly limited so as to keep the hazardous products in a minimum quantity. For instance, rechargeable batteries are used to replace the one-time used batteries. The hazardous products and their empty packaging will be stored in a specific area and subject to strict monitoring. These hazardous wastes will be packed in a uniform way before transportation so as to ensure that they will not drop and leak out. After shipping back to China, the wastes will be subject to qualified agencies for further treatment.
3. Alternatives to proposed activities
3.1 Alternatives for the camp construction
3.1.1	Alternative for no construction
Starting the scientific expedition in the Antarctic in the 1980s, China has established the Great Wall Station on George King Island in 1984/1985 and the Zhongshan Station in Larsemann Hills area in East Antarctica during 1988/1989. These two stations have become not only good bases for the Chinese scientists in the year-round scientific activities, but also a platform for international cooperation. However, these two stations are all located in the coastal areas, and China carried out more and more inland expedition tasks in east Antarctica. For this reason, China established the Kunlun Station on Dome A region in 2009, which is an ideal site for the study on global climatic and environmental changes. 
At present, Chinese Antarctic inland expeditions mainly include the expeditions of Kunlun Station and the Grove Mountains, which are provided logistics support directly by the inland fleet vehicles. Fixed wing planes may be used for logistic support in the future. Carrying out the Grove Mountains investigation adopts the fleet vehicles team or air support, while due to the difference weather systems between the Zhongshan Station and Grove Mountains, in case of emergency, there must be a place to alternate, or prone to danger. Both distance and time are long for China Kunlun Station expedition, the team will meet some problems such as plateau hypoxia. Considering the safety and humane, the personal need to relay to recover, and the proposed site is just in the middle of the route from the Zhongshan Station to the Kunlun Station. If aviation support is used for the Kunlun Station expedition, for safety consideration, the personal need a certain time for the plateau adaptation on their way to Kunlun. Meanwhile, the region has an under-ice water system, which is an ideal place to carry out related research. The proposed site was a long-term environmental observation site (weather, snow, etc.). If don’t set up the new camp, the region will not be able to provide relief and rescue protection mentioned above, and more scientific observations and researches cannot develop smoothly.
3.1.2 Alternative locations
According to the purpose of the proposed activities and function requirements, we select three proposed sites (see Fig. 3-1). The proposed site 1 (58°27′76″E, 73°51′50″S) and site 2 (75° 09′22″E, 73°11′11″S) located on the scientific investigation traverse from the Zhongshan Station to the Kunlun Station, which is convenient for the research team to reach, and can satisfy the demand of logistical support for both the Kunlun Station and Grove Mountains. According to inland research observations, compared with site 2, site 1 is more smoothly snow surface, less snow hill development, lower snow accumulation rate, thus this site is more suitable for setting up summer camp. Snow accumulation rate of proposed site 2 is significantly higher than the site 1,  and more snow hill are developed in site 2 (figure 3-2).

Fig.3-1   Locations of the three proposed sites for summer camp

Fig.3-2 Snow hill landscape of proposed site 2
Proposed site 3 (77°43′00″E, 22°73′03″S) located on the scientific research route of Grove Mountains. This site has a typical blue ice physiognomy and the ice cracks are intensive in this area (Fig.3-3). Because vehicle driving is dangerous, the area is evidently affected by the falling wind throughout the year, and unable to support inland researches of Kunlun Station. It is not suitable for building summer camp.

An annual report is produced at the end of each season. This includes details of incidents, including those of environmental incidents.
4. Initial environmental reference state of proposed area
4.1 Location
According to the accumulated observational data since first Chinese inland expedition in 1996, the proposed site is selected in the location about 520 km far from the Zhongshan Station. Because the ice surface is flat and wide, snow mounds and ridges are few, and the annual rate of accumulation is very small, this site is likely to be ideal for a summer camp.
The proposed new summer camp (76º58'29 "E, 73º51'50"S) is located in the Princess Elizabeth Land with an attitude of about 2620 m. The traveling distance is 522 km from the Zhongshan Station, 715 km from the Kunlun Station, and 85 km from the Grove Mountains. (Fig.2-1)
4.2 Geology and geomorphology
The proposed site is flat and open, with a slope of about 0.35 degrees (Fig.4-1). Ice radar data shows that the ice thickness is about 1900 m, and the subglacial area is flat. The altitude of subglacial bedrock is about 721 m.

Fig.4-1  Regional contour distribution at the proposed site (red line presents main wind direction)
Geomorphological features of the ice surface are mainly reflected by the development of the snowbank. The region has few snowbanks, and the heights are normally less than 20 cm with smooth surface (Fig.4-2). Observations show that the snow density is 0.44±0.03 g/cm3 and the rate of snow accumulation is only 3.72 cm/year, which provides excellent conditions for the establishment, operation and maintenance of the camp. Glacier movement rate is in the range of 20 m/a.

Fig. 4-2  Regional geomorphological features of the ice surface atthe proposed site
4.3 Snow and ice
4.3.1 Radar probe for ice thickness
Ice radar was used for probing the ice thickness and subglacial topographic features at the proposed site (Fig.4-3). The data show that the thickness of ice sheet is about 1900 m.

Fig.4-3  Radar ice thickness measurement at the proposed site
4.3.2 Shallow ice sheet density measurement
Through digging snow pits and drilling snow cores, the snow density were measured (Fig.4-4).  The results show that the temperature decreased gradually with the increasing of the depths, and the temperature of the 3.0 m is -31.4°C. For the density distribution, the shallow density is relatively low, and the average density of the snow pit profile is 0.44± 0.03 g/cm3. Compared with the data collected in the whole traverse from the Zhongshan Station to the Kunlun Station, the density at the proposed site is significantly higher. Gradual transition characteristic was observed from the snow pit profile, from the upper part of the fine-grained snow to the bottom of coarse-grained snow. Thin ice layer in the middle suggests the significant summer melting of surface snow.

Fig.4-4  Snow sampling in the snow pit at the proposed site
Analysis of short snow core shows that the snow densities vary between  0.37 g/cm3 and 0.60 g/cm3 and increase with the depths (Fig.4-5, Fig.4-6). The upper part is composed of soft fine-grained snow, and the lower part is composed of the grain snow. The hardness of snow layer is higher compared with those of other sampling sites.

Fig.4-5  The temperature and density profiles of 3.0 m snow pit

Fig.4-6  The density profile of  10.0 m snow core
4.3.3 Ice accumulation
The snow accumulation rate at the proposed site is only 3.72 cm/a. Compared with the accumulation rate of 18.92 cm/a at site with distance of 464 km from Zhongshan Station, the rate at the proposed site is very low.
4.3.4 Ice sheet movement observation
Combined with the previous observation data, the analysis result shows that the ice flow rate at the proposed site is around 20 m/a (Fig.4-7).

4.5 Flora and fauna
Due to the special location of Antarctic ice sheet and harsh environment, the fauna and flora are absent in the range of 100 km. 
4.6 Current usage
Since the 15th China Antarctic expedition (1998/99), the proposed site acts as a long-term environmental observation site in the Chinese inland investigation traverse from the Zhongshan Station to the Kunlun Station. There are no fixed building facilities at present in this area.
4.7 Protected areas and historic sites
There are no reserved historical sites and monuments in or near the site. The nearest protection area is Grove mountains protection area (ASPA168), which is 85 km far away from the proposed site.
Future environmental reference state in the absence of the proposed activity
Under the condition that the proposed activities are not be conducted, the primitive snow-and-ice landform of the area will maintain, the value of wildness in the area will not be affected, and the meteorological and glacial processes will keep on affecting the landform of the area. Some countries, including China, will carry out some short-term and limited scientific activities.  
5. Assessment, minimisation and mitigation of likely impacts
5.1 Atmospheric emissions
 During the initial stage of construction and operation, the fuel will be mainly used for power generation, the operation of machinery and vehicles transportation. As the alternative energy sources, the solar energy power and the wind energy will be mainly utilized for interior lighting and main scientific observations.
The fuels will be shipped by R/V Xuelong to the Zhongshan Station, and then transported to the inland camp by inland fleet vehicles. These fuels will be used for the operation of the camp, as well as the scientific activities. It can be foreseen that the fuels required by the camp (excluding those for transportation) will be kept at the lowest possible amount, and accordingly, the environmental impact arising therefrom will be very limited. 
The approximate fuel consumption by the camp during the construction and operation stages, and before and after the operation of the solar energy is shown in Table 5-1 and Table 5-2. Fuels needed by the transportation of the inland fleet vehicles have been estimated mainly according to the data on the fuel consumed respectively in the several China’s inland expeditions. Data regarding the construction of Antarctic camps by other countries have also been taken for reference when making the estimation.

5.1.1 Impact of emissions
Estimated atmospheric emission in the stage of construction and operation are shown in the Table 5-3 and Table 5-4. Substances derived from fuel combustion are: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulates, etc. These substances will cause some impacts on air quality. However, these impacts are small. This is because, firstly, the emission of all the fossil fuels will only take place in 2 or 3 months in summer, the time will be relatively short; secondly, most atmospheric emissions take place during the long-distance transportation, so the emissions can spread out quickly; and thirdly, there are relatively good out-spreading conditions at proposed site. Therefore, the emitted pollutants will spread to a very low concentration.

R/V Xuelong sails along its regular navigational route, thus, the arising atmospheric emissions will spread out quickly and will not generate obvious impacts on wildlife, ocean and atmospheric quality. 
The potential impacts include those on the snow and ice surface of the camp area. This kind of pollution may affect part of the scientific value of the area. The particulates may exist in the snow and ice for a long time. 
The atmospheric emission will accumulate, and some emitted gas will affect the atmospheric environment of the area.  NOx is a catalyst consumed by ozone. CO will stay in the air for about 1 month, and will finally become CO2.  CO2 is a product of maximum quantity in the combustion process. It will not directly affect human’s health, however, as a greenhouse gas it will obstruct heat spreading from the earth into the atmosphere, thus having the potential to warm up the earth.
5.1.2 Mitigations
·To utilize clean fossil fuels entirely. Aerial kerosene is the only fossil fuels used by the camp and mechanical vehicles.
·To use renewable energy sources as much as possible. Energy-saving is a key indicator in the design of the camp.
·To select equipment with high efficiency. The combustion efficiency and environmental efficiency are the principal indexes for equipment selection.
·To adopt energy-saving technology. For example, try to reduce the usage of vehicles.
·Additionally, perfect energy management system will be set up in the camp. Scientific energy-management will not only mitigate the atmospheric emission of pollutants, but also reduce the operation cost.
5.2 Impacts on snow/ice and mitigations
5.2.1 Impacts on snow and ice 
As the camp will be established directly on the ice surface, the environmental impacts arising from the moving, clearance and compaction of the surrounding snow will be very limited during the camp construction. 
During the construction and operation of the camp, some snow will be piled up and stored for the melting snow is needed. This will lead to slight impact on the snow and ice environment. 
The exhausted gas arising from all the activities is in small amount. It will reach the most part of the snow area, however, due to the changeable wind directions, it will not deposit in any fixed snow surface. 
Most of the waste water of the camp can reach the standard for recycling after the membrane technology treatment, and the concentrate liquid will be removed out of the camp, making no impact on snow and ice. 
On the way from the Zhongshan Station to the camp, the driving of the inland fleet vehicles will compact the snow surface, thus change the natural conditions of the snow. However, the wind may mitigate such impact. In the low-latitude inland, as the wind velocity is higher, the traces of vehicles will be covered by snow quickly. While in the high-latitude inland, the traces will remain for a period of time, but finally they will also be totally covered by snow.  
5.2.2 Mitigation measures 
The issue of reducing impact on snow and ice has been taken into full consideration in the design of the camp. For example, the main buildings of the camp will be directly located on the ice surface. And because the accumulation rate of snow is low, the environmental impact arising from the moving, clearance and compaction of the snow surrounding the camp caused by the construction is very limited. Moreover, aviation kerosene is utilized for inland fleet vehicles and the camp, and all the selected vehicles and mechanical equipment must have advanced techniques and excellent performance. For this reason, the volume of waste gas arising therefrom will be low, and hence, the impact on ice snow will be little. In addition, the inland fleet vehicles will be drive on the relatively smooth ground surface where there are less snow dunes so that the impact on the snow surface can be reduced as much as possible.
5.3 Sewage
5.3.1 Assessment of sewage impact
Domestic sewage (grey water and black water) will mainly come from cooking, daily washing and brushing, clothes-washing, bathing, dish-washing and human excrement (See section 2.5.6 Water supply and drainage system). They all have certain impacts on the local environment.
5.3.2 Mitigation measures for sewage impacts
Water-saving device will be provided in the design of the camp in order to reduce the water consumption and to minimize the production of wastewater. At the camp, the waste water will be treated through ultra-filtration techniques and reverse osmosis to filter, sterilize\. The treated water that reaches the standards will be reused for clothing washing, bathing and sanitary cleaning, etc.
The filtered residues will be collected and transported out of Antarctica. When the expeditioners withdraw, all the water in pipelines shall be emptied to ensure the soundness of the facilities.  
As for the human excrement, in the construction stage, the car anhydrous packaging toilet will be used, and all human excrement will be packed up and transported out of the proposed area. when the camp is built, negative pressure flush-free systems will be utilized to reduce the volume of the faeces so as to minimize the impacts on local environment.
5.4 Solid waste
During the stage of the camp construction and operation, a certain amount of solid waste will be produced, and the solid waste produced during the construction stage will be obviously more than that produced during the stage of operation (Table 5-5, Table 5-6). In the construction stage of the camp, a certain amount of innocuous solid waste will be produced. They are mainly packing materials and building materials, including metal, plastics, glass and wood, etc., as well as solid domestic waste and food waste. There are also a relatively small amount of hazardous waste, such as agglomerate, battery, solvent, oily waste and paint. The possible amount of wastes produced in the construction stage of the camp is estimated.

5.4.1 Impact of solid waste
Solid waste may be dispersed if they are not packed and stored properly, making some environmental impact at the site. The removal of waste for disposal out of Antarctica may have an indirect environmental impact on the special Antarctic ecosystem.
5.4.2 Mitigation measures
To try best to reduce unnecessary packing materials to minimize the volume of waste at the site, and don’t take prohibited products by the Annex III to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty to Antarctica. The quantity of hazardous articles will be kept to the absolutely minimum extent. Solid waste will be classified, appropriately stored, labelled and put into fixed waste container for transportation. These solid wastes will be reused when possible. To formulate a waste management plan, including stipulations on the collection, storage, utilization and treatment of waste, conduct training on the personnel, so as to make them familiar with and have a good command of the classification, storage and disposal of waste. To appoint a person as an environmental officer to direct and supervise the implementation of waste management procedure, meanwhile, to appoint another person as the waste manager to implement properly the waste management procedure and make regular supervision for it. 
All the solid waste will be brought out of the site and transported back to China for further handling upon the withdrawal of the expedition team. Part of the human excrement will be brought to the Zhongshan Station for further treatment. The waste produced during the expedition will be brought back to the camp for appropriate disposal according to the relative regulation of the camp.
5.5 Light pollution
5.5.1 Analysis on the sources of light pollution
When the expeditioners live and work at the camp, light source will be needed for illumination. As the man-made light source will be added to the area where there is only original natural light, certain impact will be brought to the surrounding environment. However, since there is no fauna and flora existing in the area, the man-made light source can only affect, to some extent, the scientific research projects which are sensitive to light. During the operation stage in the Antarctic summer, the camp will be in the period of Polar Day, therefore, light impact arising in this period will be very little.
5.5.2 Measures to mitigate light pollution
Try to use the natural light and reduce the usage of illuminating light. 
5.6 Fauna and flora
5.6.1 Analysis of impact on fauna and flora
The loading and unloading at the existing wharf of the Zhongshan Station and the transportation between the wharf and the Zhongshan Station may give rise to impact on animals. However, this impact will be very small and transitory because the area around the Zhongshan Station is not the gathering place of animals, and these activities will take place in December or February when the mating season of animals has come to an end. Thus, the impact will be minor or short.
During the operation stages of the camp, aircraft flights will be very seldom. If there is any, the flight of aircraft will be kept within the limitation of height and space stipulated in Antarctic Flight Information Manual formulated by COMNAP. 
In the construction and operation stages of the camp, there will be no impact on local fauna and flora since the fauna and flora in the surrounding areas are absent.  
5.6.2 Mitigation measures
To reduce as much as possible the usage of vessels, vehicles, mechanical equipments and aircrafts, etc. To provide training for crews, pilots, engineering staff and members of the scientific expedition team, and ensure to minimize the interference towards marine animals such as seals, birds, and penguins near the Zhongshan Station. 
5.7 Introduction of alien species and translocation of diseases
5.7.1 Analysis of environmental impact
During the construction and operation of the camp, the risk to introduce alien species or transmit diseases into Antarctica will be very little. Because firstly, all the team members going to Antarctica must pass an all-round and strict physical examination, the occurrence of communicable disease will be impossible. Secondly, cooked food and dried food will be taken as much as possible. Thirdly, wastes will be put under effective control. All wastes will be properly preserved and be taken out of Antarctica as much as possible. And finally, the temperature in the proposed site is very low, so any possible introduced species may be unable to survive for a long time. 
5.7.2 Mitigation measures
Paragraphs 4(5)-(6) of Annex II of the Protocol on Environmental Protection and the stipulations of the Appendix will be strictly observed and the introduction of alien species and the migration of diseases will be prevented to the greatest possible extent. 
Meanwhile, following the normal practices of the Chinese Antarctic expedition team, a comprehensive and strict physical examination will be carried out for the team members so as to prevent the occurrence of communicable diseases. Foodstuff will be kept under control so as to ensure all foodstuff, including the food provided at the camp and the food for field encampment, be safely stored and disposed. A cleaning process will be applied to such as all clothing, scientific instruments, mechanical and field-operational equipments before being transported into Antarctica and particularly, the railed and wheeled vehicles will be rinsed before entering Antarctica. And all the wastes will be well managed and properly disposed of and be brought out of Antarctica to the greatest possible extent. 
 5.8 Physical interference, aesthetic value
5.8.1 Analysis of environmental impact
The proposed camp is located in the inland of east Antarctica. It is wild and desolate. Therefore, there will be little local visual impact to build the camp there, except some minor impact within the limited visual range. 
As the camp will be built directly on ice surface, the environmental impacts arising from the moving, clearance and compaction of the floating snow around the camp will be very limited.
During the construction and operation of the camp, melting water is necessary. Piling up and storing snow may bring minor impact on snow and ice environment. 
The camp will use recycling water to its great extent, and no sewage is discharged at the camp. Therefore, the impact of sewage on ice and snow is little.
The utilization of vehicles and mechanical equipment by the camp will leave traces on snow surface. However, these traces will soon be covered by snow. There will be only minor impacts.
The camp will use clean fossil fuel and renewable energy resource as much as possible, and update equipment with high efficiency, so the impact on atmosphere is slight.
A Waste Management Plan will be implemented at the camp and all the wastes will be brought out of Antarctica. In addition, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the camp will be carried out so as to reduce the negative impact on the local environment.   
5.8.2 Mitigation measures
In the design of the camp, the local environmental conditions will be taken into full consideration, and harmonization with the local environment will be made to the greatest possible extent so as to minimize visual impact.
The camp will use clean fossil fuel and solar energy as much as possible and adopt highly efficient vehicles and mechanical equipment, so as to minimize the emission to the atmosphere.
The camp will reduce as much as possible the usage of vehicles, mechanical equipment and aircraft and marking out the driving roads of vehicles to ensure that the number of tracks can be kept at the lowest level. 
The camp will do its best to use cycling water so as to minimize the volume of melted water and subsequently, the impact on the local environment. 
At the end of the operation of the camp, all the facilities will be disassembled, dismounted and transported out of the inland, thus leaving no obvious traces. The dismounting and clearing work of the camp will be done in accordance with the requirements of environmental impact evaluation.
5.9 Indirect and cumulative impacts
In order to minimize environmental impacts, the measures to prevent and mitigate environmental impacts have been taken into full consideration in the design stage of the camp, and the EMP has been formulated. Therefore, no obvious indirect environmental impacts will arise. 
Cumulative impacts may arise from the emission to the atmosphere, oil spill, etc. However, due to the adoption of measures of environmental protection and energy saving, direct impacts will be reduced to a rather low level. There will be no obvious cumulative impacts in a long period, and the greatest possibility might be the reduction of part of the scientific value of located area.
5.10 Impact matrix
According to the analysis mentioned above, a table of impact matrix was completed. It summarized the environmental impacts of the construction and operation activities considering the probability, extent, duration and significance of these impacts (see Table 5-7). The output and resulting environmental impact of each activity is identified in the impact matrix (Table 5-8), and measures that will be adopted to mitigate or prevent those impacts from occurring are shown in the table as well.

6. Monitoring and verification
Taking into account of the alterations that will be inevitably caused to the surrounding areas by the erection of the camp, a series of potential environmental impact and the corresponding mitigation measures have been tabled in Section 5. With the objective of sustainable development, CAA has formulated a perfect EMP for the new camp, so as to better manage the actual impacts derived from the construction and operation of the camp and secure the effectiveness of the mitigation measures.
China has accomplished a series of multidisciplinary surveys during previous expeditions, in which the environmental information has been collected as the reference data for the future monitoring. Information related to the erection and operation of the camp, including fuel consumption, numbers of personnel to the camp, waste disposal, etc., will be recorded for monitoring purposes. Such information, once available, will be used to validate the IEE in the respect of whether the impacts caused by the new camp are as predicted, thus provide a basis upon which the recommended mitigation measures will be reviewed and adjusted.
7. Gaps in knowledge and uncertainties
During several expeditions conducted over the section from Zhongshan Station to the Kunlun Station in Dome A between the year 1996 and 2013, and a special expedition to the proposed site during the 29th CHINARE, we have acquired some knowledge on the environment of the proposed site. But simultaneous monitoring and study on the potential hazards that may be caused by the construction and operation of the camp have yet been conducted due to the circumstantial restriction. 
The design life of the camp is 10 years, so it is impossible for the IEE to include all the variations derived from technical progress arising in such a long process of installation and operation of the camp. Therefore, it is necessary to make some additional assessment on these variations. According to experience, the change of environmental conditions like whether and so on may result in some uncertain factors. Meanwhile, the change of future scientific research interests or other activities, the application of more advanced techniques, and the continuous improvement of the design and adjustment to the construction mode may also cause some uncertainties.  Such uncertainties may lead to the delay of the construction and slight changes in the capacity of scientific and logistic support in the future. However, this IEE has, to the maximum extent, taken into account the limitations and uncertainties for the erection and operation of the new camp to be located in the Princess Elizabeth Land.
8. Environmental management 
In the systematic design of the camp, environment protection, safety, energy saving and economy are the basis for the assessment and decision-making. On this account, personnel responsible for environmental impact assessment were involved at the very beginning of the design of the project scheme, and put forward a number of useful advices on how to reduce adverse environmental impacts. 
Before the start of the construction, CAA will organize personnel to formulate an EMP according to the Protocol on the Environment Protection and relevant Chinese laws and regulations on environmental protection, on streamlining the management mechanism, elaborating management plan, defining the roles and duties of relevant personnel, and making mitigation measures, with the objective to ensure the minimization of adverse environment impact. 
The EMP will cover the management on the operation of fuel, waste, equipment, field works and the emergency response, etc., which will guarantee all the activities will be proceeded in order and in a safe manner, and prevent the occurrence of environmental accidents, so as to  minimize environment impacts. 
Meanwhile, CAA will conduct education and training on environment protection, work specifications, emergency response and equipment operation, etc., for the personnel involved, and designate environmental officers to supervise the implementation of contract and management plan in the work field. 
Investigation and analysis will be conducted on the basis of environment monitoring programs carried out in the camp, such as to discover the adverse environmental impact as early as possible, diminishing and/or mitigating the impacts in timely manner.
 In case of any environment accident or any other accident, CAA will report to State Oceanic Administration of China and inform the Contracting Parties. Upon the completion of the infrastructure construction, CAA shall work together with PRIC drawing up a report summarizing the general status of the environment, health, safety, accident and monitoring, etc.
9. Conclusion
The proposed summer camp in the Princess Elizabeth Land is of great significance for relay and transfer, emergency rescue, security and scientific researches in the inland expedition in east Antarctica. The project takes full consideration of the possible environmental impact of the summer camp during the construction and operation period, and formulated effective measures to prevent and mitigate such environmental impact.
This Initial Environmental Evaluation Report contains an analysis of all possible environmental impact caused by the camp construction, operation and maintenance, the transportation of cargo and personnel to the proposed camp, and corresponding prevention and mitigation measures, gaps in knowledge and the rough uncertainties, etc.
The evaluation shows that the proposed construction and operation of the inland summer camp has taken full consideration of environment protection and energy saving elements. With the use of green energy and the latest environment friendly technology to the maximum extent, the adverse environmental impact cause by the construction and operation of the proposed camp will be reduced to the minimum extent. With the scientific design, rational arrangement, and feasible technic, the preventive and mitigating measures will further decrease the impacts on the environment to the minimum end. As a conclusion, the construction and operation of the camp may have no more than minor and transitory impacts on the Antarctic environment. Therefore, China considers that the initiation of the project is fully justifiable.
