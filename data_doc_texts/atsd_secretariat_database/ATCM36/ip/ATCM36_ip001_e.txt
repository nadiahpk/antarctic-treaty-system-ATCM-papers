Report by the CCAMLR Observer to the
Thirty-Sixth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting

1.	The Thirty-first Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR-XXXI) was chaired by Mr T. Løbach (Norway). Twenty-five Members, the Netherlands, Singapore, Viet Nam, and representatives of NGOs and industry participated. A copy of the Report of CCAMLR-XXXI is available in the public domain at www.ccamlr.org/node/72699.
Compliance
2. The Commission approved a Non-Contracting Party-IUU Vessel List (www.ccamlr.org/node/72732) noting at least seven vessels persistently engaged in IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area. 
Finance and Administration
3. The Commission endorsed revised Staff Regulations, revised Financial Regulations including an investment policy, an implementation report for the Strategic Plan, a budget for 2014 and provisional budget for 2015 and the commencement of work on a sustainable financing policy. 
Scientific Committee
Krill resources
4.	In 2011/12, five Members harvested 161 143 tonnes of krill from Subareas 48.1 (75 495 tonnes), 48.2 (29 238 tonnes) and 48.3 (52 410 tonnes)1. In comparison, the total reported catch of krill in 2010/11 was 180 992 tonnes taken from Subareas 48.1 (9 215 tonnes), 48.2 (115 995 tonnes) and 48.3 (55 782 tonnes). 
5.	Notifications for krill fishing in 2012/13 were received from eight Members for 19 vessels with a total predicted catch of 597 700 tonnes. 
6.	The Commission endorsed the Scientific Committee’s plan for the development of the feedback management strategy for the krill fishery in Area 48. 
Finfish resources
7.	In 2011/12, 11 Members fished for toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and/or D. mawsoni). The reported total catch was 11 329 tonnes2. In comparison, the total reported catch of toothfish in 2010/11 was 14 669 tonnes. 
8.	Two Members targeted icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). The reported total catch of C. gunnari was 999 tonnes2.
9.	The Commission noted possible signs of recovery for populations of C. gunnari and Notothenia rossii near the South Shetland Islands. The fishery targeting these species was closed in 1990 to allow the stocks to recover. The Commission agreed that this fishery remain closed until such time that research is undertaken to confirm the recovery of these populations and an assessment is provided. 


Exploratory fisheries
10.	Ten Members notified 26 vessels for exploratory longline fisheries for Dissostichus spp. for 2012/13. The Commission noted the increasing number of vessels notifying for exploratory fisheries and requested that further consideration be given to the issue of limiting capacity in exploratory fisheries. No new fisheries were notified for 2012/13.
Fish and invertebrate by-catch
11. 	The Scientific Committee’s recommendations in relation to by-catch issues included the need to examine finfish by-catch across the krill fishing fleet for vessels using all trawl gears and the development of a risk-based sustainable management approach for the impact of toothfish fisheries on skates.
Assessment and avoidance of incidental mortality
12. 	The total extrapolated mortalities of seabirds within the French EEZs in 2011/12 were estimated to be 222 birds. A total of three seabird mortalities were recorded elsewhere in the Convention Area. 
13. 	France stressed that some of the most important albatross and petrel breeding sites were located within its EEZs and that, despite France’s efforts to protect them, it was regrettable that these populations remain at risk as a result of incidental mortality occurring north of the Convention Area. 
Bottom fishing and vulnerable marine ecosystems 
14.	The Commission endorsed advice on the implementation of measures to avoid and mitigate significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) during bottom fishing, noting that 12 VMEs were added to the VME registry during 2012. There were 38 notifications of encounters with potential VMEs during exploratory bottom fisheries in 2011/12. A total of 150 VME risk-areas have been closed to fishing since the introduction of this conservation measure (CM 22-06) in 2008/09.
Marine Protected Areas 
15.	The Commission welcomed the Scientific Committee’s progress towards establishing a representative system of MPAs arising from three technical workshops held during 2012 for Planning Domain 1 (Antarctic Peninsula), Domain 5 (Del Cano–Crozet), and Domains 3 (Weddell Sea), 4 (Bouvet and Maud Rise) and 9 (Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea). It welcomed proposed collaboration between Sweden, the Republic of Korea and the USA to progress work on Domain 9. 
16. 	The Commission noted the discussion of the Scientific Committee on the establishment of precautionary spatial protection to facilitate the scientific study of habitats and communities in case of the future collapse of ice shelves.
17.	In accordance with ATCM Decision 9 (2005), the Commission endorsed the advice of the Scientific Committee in respect of: 
(i)	the revised management plans for ASPA No. 144, ASPA No. 145 and ASPA No. 146 noting the importance of these areas for scientific research that were unlikely to be subject to harvesting
(ii)	the draft management plan for a new ASPA at Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay, Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea 
(iii)	progress on a revised management plan for ASMA No. 1, Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Archipelago, noting the proposal for a draft management plan to be submitted to CCAMLR in 2013.
18.	The Commission agreed that no issues with respect to CCAMLR had been identified in these proposals and that this advice should be communicated to the ATCM. 
19. 	The Commission noted that krill fishing had occurred in 2010 in ASPA No. 153, Eastern Dallmann Bay, and that the management plan for this ASPA does not allow for harvesting as a permitted activity. 
20. 	The Commission agreed that fishing in ASPA No. 153 had occurred as a result of a lack of awareness of the requirements of the management plan and that there was a need for a mechanism to provide a direct link between CCAMLR conservation measures and the management plans for ASPAs and ASMAs as described in ATCM Decision 9 (2005) – see paragraph 26 below. 
Climate change 
21. 	The Commission noted the advice of the Scientific Committee with respect to climate change, including the discussion of the potential effects of climate change on krill. 
Administrative matters 
22.	Progress was reported in addressing recommendations of the 2008 Performance Review Panel Report in respect of capacity building. In 2012 there were five applications from five Members for the CCAMLR Scholarship Scheme. Two candidates, one from Argentina and one from China, were selected. The contribution to the work of the Scientific Committee of the recipient of the 2011 Scholarship from Chile was warmly welcomed.
Scheme of International Scientific Observation
23.	The Commission endorsed an external review of the CCAMLR Scheme of International Scientific Observation. 
Conservation Measures
24. 	Conservation measures and resolutions adopted at CCAMLR-XXXI have been published in the Schedule of Conservation Measures in Force 2012/13. 
Compliance Evaluation Procedure
25. 	The Commission endorsed a compliance evaluation procedure (CM 10-10 (2012)) to strengthen information available to the Commission in relation to compliance issues for Members. 
ASPAs and ASMAs
26. 	The Commission agreed to a new conservation measure on the protection of the values of ASPAs and ASMAs (CM 91-02 (2012)) (Annex). This measure seeks to ensure that fishing vessels licensed in accordance with CCAMLR measures are aware of the location and relevant management plans of all ASPAs and ASMAs which include marine areas.
Revised Resolution
27.	The Commission urged Members to consider ratifying the Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on the Implementation of the Provisions of Torremolinos Protocol of 1993 relating to the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977 (‘Cape Town Agreement’) in order to enhance the safety of fishing vessels in the Convention Area (revised Resolution 34/XXXI (Enhancing the safety of fishing vessels in the Convention Area). 
Proposals for MPAs and special areas
28.	The Commission considered proposals for MPAs in East Antarctica (one proposal), the Ross Sea region (two proposals – subsequently combined in a single proposal) and to establish Special Areas for Scientific Research (SASRs) in marine habitats and communities exposed following ice-shelf collapse (one proposal). 
29. 	The Commission was unable to agree to the proposal in relation to protection of areas exposed as a result of ice-shelf collapse. In relation to the other two proposals the Commission agreed to convene an intersessional meeting of the Scientific Committee followed by a Special Meeting of the Commission to continue the Commission’s work in relation to MPAs. The meetings will take place at Bremerhaven, Germany, 11 to 16 July 2013. The Special Meeting will consider MPA issues and make decisions, if possible, on the joint New Zealand and the USA MPA proposal for the Ross Sea region and the joint Australia, France and EU MPA proposal on East Antarctica.
Cooperation with the Antarctic Treaty System and International Organisations
Cooperation with SCAR
30.	The Commission noted that a CCAMLR/SCAR Action Group will meet immediately prior to ATCM XXXVI in Brussels to discuss CCAMLR/SCAR strategic engagement.
Election of Chair
31.	The Commission elected Poland as the Chair of the Commission.
Date and location of the next meeting
32.	The Thirty-second Meeting will be held in Hobart from 23 October to 1 November 2013. 

ANNEX

CONSERVATION MEASURE 91-02 (2012)
Protection of the values of Antarctic Specially Managed 
and Protected Areas 

Species	all
Area	all
Season	all
Gear	all

The Commission, 
Recognising that the protection of the Antarctic marine environment and of Antarctic marine living resources, including through Marine Protected Areas, has long been recognised as desirable and valuable within the agreements and bodies that make up the Antarctic Treaty System, 
Recalling that the commitment towards the designation of spatial protection is clearly defined both within the 1991 Protocol of Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the 1980 CAMLR Convention,
Recalling that in accordance with the Protocol, any Antarctic area, including any marine area, may be designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) or an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA),
Recognising that activities in ASPAs and ASMAs may be prohibited, restricted or managed, in accordance with management plans adopted under the provisions of Annex V of the Protocol, 
Noting that the Convention (Articles V and VIII) provides for close cooperation between CCAMLR and the Antarctic Treaty,
Recalling that the competences of, and relationships between the ATCM and CCAMLR have been clarified and affirmed in the Protocol itself and subsequently by Decision 4 (1998) – Marine Protected Areas, and Decision 9 (2005) – Marine Protected Areas and Other Areas of Interest to CCAMLR, respectively,
Noting that the 2011 CCAMLR MPA Workshop noted that a harmonised approach in the Antarctic Treaty System to spatial protection may result in having ASPAs and ASMAs designated by the ATCM within CCAMLR MPAs,
Understanding that such a multi-level hierarchical approach to area management could harmonise decisions made at the ATCM and CCAMLR, allowing for detailed consideration of activities not normally considered by CCAMLR,
Concerned that potential harvesting in ASPAs and ASMAs could jeopardise the high scientific value of the long-term ecosystem studies being carried out in these areas, undermining the goals established in the management plans of these areas,
Noting that the presence of fishing vessels in ASPAs and ASMAs might have occurred due to a lack of awareness of the existence of these designated areas among those responsible for fishing vessels,
Recognising the need for more informative and timely communications between the ATCM and CCAMLR with regard to the publication and availability of management plans of ASPAs and ASMAs containing marine areas,
Recalling that the Commission has previously endorsed the harmonised approach in the Antarctic Treaty System to spatial protection,
adopts the following Conservation Measure in accordance with Article III of the Convention:
1. 	Each Contracting Party shall ensure that their fishing vessels licensed1 in accordance with Conservation Measure 10-02 are aware of the location and relevant management plan of all designated ASPAs and ASMAs which include marine areas listed in Annex 91-02/A.
1	Includes permitted


Annex 91-02/A
