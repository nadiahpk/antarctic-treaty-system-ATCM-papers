Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites
and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2012-13 Season
Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites
and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2012-13 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM
information on IAATO operator landing sites and site guideline use.
This information paper presents the data collected by IAATO
covering the landing sites and site guidelines use for the 2012-13
season.
Additional information on IAATO member activities can be found in
ATCM XXXVI IP103 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2012/13 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2013/14 and
Beyond.
Antarctic Peninsula traditional Ship-borne Tourism
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional
ship-based tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, representing over
95% of all landed activity. Figure 1 provides a comparison of the
factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of
passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). As all
traditional ship-based tourism to the Peninsula during the 2012-13
season was conducted by IAATO member operators, it is believed
that this information is reflective of actual levels of this activity.
Figure 1: Factor Change in Traditional Landing Ship-borne Tourism
(not including sailing or motor vessels carrying 12 or fewer
passengers) in the Antarctic Peninsula 1989-2013
There has been an increase in the levels of traditional ship-borne
tourism in the Peninsula area, with a number of vessels returning or
re-entering the arena. The numbers are still below the peak in the
2007-08 season prior to the global economic downturn. The
numbers of passengers visiting the Peninsula is still 24% less than
the 2007-08 season. Since the peak season of 2007-2008, there was
a steady decline in ships working in the area, from 33 in 2007-08 to
only 20 in the 2011-12 season. However, the 2012-13 season saw
the first increase (up to 22 vessels). The number of voyages, and
consequently the number of landings, has
also increased from last season by 16% and 13% respectively. The
number of landing sites used has increased by two from last year.
Both were anchorages that were newly recorded from yacht
operators.
Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Table 1 illustrates the 20 most-visited sites in terms of
landings made for the 2012-13 season. As in previous years, this
represents seventy two percent of the total number of landings
made and over seventy-six percent of the landed passengers. This
indicates that the tendency for landings to concentrate at a few
popular sites continues.
All but one of these most-visited sites – Portal Point – are covered
by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Visitor Site
Guidelines or through National Program management through their
proximity to stations. Portal Point is a continent landing with a
short walk onto the edge of a glacier with no breeding wildlife
present. However, the site is covered by IAATO Site Specific
guidelines, and IAATO member operators follow standard
guidelines whenever they make a landing in the Antarctic. Because
there is no breeding wildlife and the ATCM has already adopted
general guidelines for visitors, IAATO does not feel it necessary to
create ATCM visitor site guidelines for Portal Point.
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at
all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula. For 2012-13, the season was
149 days down from 157 the previous season, with the first vessel
landing on 6 November 2012 and the last vessel leaving the
Antarctic Treaty Area on 4 April 2013. The core period for
visitation by ships was 120 days from mid November to mid March.
On the basis of the full season dates, only Goudier Island received
an average of more than one visit per day. Three sites, Goudier
Island, Neko Harbour and Whalers Bay, received an average of
more than one visit per day during the core season.
Additional tourism statistics will be posted on the IAATO website
(www.iaato.org) by June, 2013.
Use of ATCM Endorsed Site Guidelines
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Site
Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff
and analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms.
The total number of known landings made at sites covered by the
ATCM Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of
occasions the daily visitation limits were met for both seasons, is
shown in Appendix 3.
Co-ordination among IAATO field staff remains very effective.
Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates that the daily
limits set in the site guidelines were honoured, with no exceptions.
Conclusion
The Post Visit Report forms indicate a growth in the levels of
landed activities, although levels are still lower than the peak
season of 2007-08 by approximately 15%. While there is an
increase in the number of ships operating, voyages and passengers,
the greatest increase has been in the number of landings in
particular. This is in part accountable to the increase in air/cruise
activities this past season. Air/Cruise itineraries mean that the
vessel will not leave the region and so can maximise the landing
opportunities.
Almost all the sites in the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula
are regulated by ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National
Program management guidelines. IAATO will continue to provide
this information annually to the CEP and ATCM for their members’
activities.
IAATO Members remain interested in gaining a better
understanding of the use of ATCM Site Guidelines by non-IAATO
visitors.
