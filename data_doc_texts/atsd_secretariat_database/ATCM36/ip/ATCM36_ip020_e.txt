Antarctic Site Inventory: 1994-2013
Summary
This paper provides an update on results of the Antarctic Site Inventory (ASI) through February 2013. The ASI, led by Ron Naveen of Oceanites, Inc., Dr. Heather Lynch of Stony Brook University, and Dr. William Fagan of the University of Maryland, has collected biological data and site-descriptive information in the Antarctic Peninsula since 1994.1  Over the years, this work has been funded by a number of United States government grants, grant awards and contracts from other Parties (United Kingdom, Germany), private foundation grants, donations facilitated by Antarctic tour ship operators, and public support. The project's methodology and results from previous field seasons were fully described and discussed in ATCM XXXII IP1 and ATCM XXXII IP32 and at previous ATCMs.2
 Introduction
The ASI began fieldwork in November 1994, examining whether opportunistic visits can be used:
    1) to effectively and economically detect possible visitor-caused changes in the physical features, flora, and fauna of sites in the Antarctic Peninsula being visited repeatedly by ship-based tourists; 
    2) to collect baseline information necessary to detect possible changes in the physical and biological variables being monitored; and 
    3) to determine how best  to minimize or avoid possible environmental impacts of tourism, visitation, and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Peninsula area.
The ASI has demonstrated an ability to reach Antarctic Peninsula visitor sites frequently and cost-effectively, relying opportunistically on commercial cruise/tour vessels, yachts, and various national research vessels. The advantages of placing researchers on a cruise/tour ships, yachts, and government research vessels include wide spatial coverage of the western and northeastern Antarctic Peninsula and a negligible “footprint” on the landscape.3 These well-timed visits by trained researchers have proved an effective means of characterizing sites and for collecting relevant biological data. The ASI’s comprehensive, Peninsula-wide, spatial and temporal approach is unique, aimed at collecting and analyzing data that are otherwise impossible to obtain via ‘single site’ penguin studies or at national Antarctic research stations, and has generated an enormous body of data, information, and analyses that are readily and publicly available (http://www.oceanites.org/links/ and http://lynchlab.com/publications/).
These data and the associated analyses have enabled a suite of important scientific and practical outcomes including a better understanding of climate change in the vastly warming Antarctic Peninsula environment, the development of site-specific management guidelines that Treaty Parties have adopted, and the Treaty Parties’ ongoing examination of potential tourism impacts.4
Data collected by the ASI assist the implementation of the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which, among other things, requires a priori environmental impact assessments for all activities for which advance notification is required, including tourism,5 and for monitoring to be done, as and when necessary, to assess and verify predicted environmental impacts. The ASI’s primary objective is to identify and detect changes at the sites being monitored, and to determine whether any changes are naturally occurring or are caused by tourism or other human activities.6
Recently, these region-wide analyses have been assisted by the availability of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery. Lynch et al (2012) and Naveen and Lynch, et al. (2012b) demonstrate the utility of such imagery for detecting penguin colonies and estimating penguin abundance.  In regard to moss lichen diversity in the Antarctic Peninsula, the project has begun to examine changing relationships between species diversity and environmental factors to assist with the management of Antarctica’s floral communities.
Results, Trends
In 19 seasons from November 1994 through February 2013, the ASI has made 1,354 site visits and collected data at 206 Antarctic Peninsula locations. During the recently concluded 2012-13 field season, the ASI made 127 site visits and collected data at 86 sites; 25 of these sites were visited multiple times, 61 were visited only once. 
The tour ships assisting ASI in the 2012-13 season were: MV Akademik Ioffe (One Ocean Expeditions), 11 site visits; MV Akademik Sergey Vavilov (One Ocean Expeditions), 53 site visits; and MV Ortelius (chartered by Cheeseman’s Ecology Safaris), 17 site visits. The ASI also chartered the yacht Golden Fleece (Golden Fleece Expeditions) to census the southern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, from Pursuit Point, Wiencke Island south to Marguerite Bay (46 site visits).
In the 2012-13 season, as well as over the 19-year history of the ASI, there have been repetitive visits to all of the visitor sites that are most heavily visited by expedition tourists, to all sites which exhibit the most species diversity and are most prone to potential environmental disturbance from human visitors,7 and to the species-diverse, environmentally sensitive tourism sites now subject to Site Guidelines for Visitors adopted at recent ATCMs.8
The ASI continues to track and document the rapid change in the relative populations of gentoo, chinstrap, and Adélie penguins throughout the western Antarctic Peninsula, with gentoo penguin populations increasing rapidly and expanding their range southward, and the other two species declining significantly.
Recent Papers
The paper describing the ASI’s site-wide chinstrap penguin nesting survey at Deception Island in December 2011 has now been published.9 The paper reports on the first ever, complete penguin survey of Deception Island (62°57¢ S, 60°38¢ W), which the ASI achieved in December 2011, and which includes complete census counts of breeding Pygoscelis antarctica (chinstrap penguins) at the penguin breeding sites known as Baily Head (50,408 breeding pairs) and Vapour Col (19,177 breeding pairs). Our census of the Baily Head breeding site suggests an approximately 51% decline in the abundance of chinstraps breeding at Baily Head since the 1986/87 estimates by Shuford and Spear (1988). In addition, this was the first effort to use high-resolution satellite imagery for abundance estimation of chinstrap penguins, and produced abundance estimates for the 2009/10 Baily Head population that are indistinguishable from the 2011/12 season estimates obtained by direct census of individual nests. Nest counts of individual subgroups at Baily Head in the 2002/03 and 2009/10 seasons were used to estimate nesting density in those two years, and this estimate, along with colony area as extrapolated from the satellite imagery for 2002/03 and 2009/10, was used to estimate a 39% decline at Baily Head between 2002/03 and 2009/10. 
Deception Island is one of the most frequently visited locations in the entire Antarctic continent and there has been extensive speculation that tourism may have a negative impact on the chinstrap penguins breeding at Baily Head. Because the population changes for Baily Head are consistent with chinstrap declines at other nearby Antarctic Peninsula locations10, we find no evidence to support the hypothesis that tourism is responsible for the decline in chinstrap abundance at Baily Head. The data and analyses in this paper represent a critical benchmark against which to compare future changes at Deception Island and provide insights key to effective seabird monitoring throughout Antarctica. 
A forthcoming paper will represent the accumulation of 19 years of seabird population abundance data collected by the ASI in the Antarctic Peninsula and associated sub-Antarctic Islands.11 This data paper will include records for seven species of seabirds (Adélie penguin [Pygoscelis adeliae], gentoo penguin [P. papua], chinstrap penguin [P. antarctica], macaroni penguin [Eudyptes chrysolophus], blue-eyed shag [Phalacrocorax atriceps], kelp gull [Larus dominicanus], and southern giant petrel [Macronectes giganteus]), and will include data already published and seven years of recent data not previous published. Census data represent a mix of nest and chick counts; each census record includes the location, date, and precision of the census count, along with any auxiliary notes. Included with the database are maps to clarify the location of specific breeding populations that may be new (and thus not previous reported) or ambiguous. This compilation will represent the best single source of raw data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Pygoscelis penguins in the Antarctic Peninsula region and will provide population data on several flying bird species less frequently studied.
Monitoring & Analytical Goals
In examining long-term changes in Antarctic Peninsula penguin and seabird populations, Oceanites’ collaboration with The Fagan Lab at the University of Maryland and The Lynch Lab at Stony Brook University intends to:
    1) characterize decadal scale changes in these populations throughout the Peninsula;
    2) discern how Antarctic species are changing in abundance, relative abundance, and spatial distribution;
    3) identify the factors specifically driving these long-term changes; 
    4) understand how Peninsula biological and physical processes, as well as direct/cumulative impacts from human activities, may connect;
    5) identify the likely drivers of population shifts (both numerical and spatial); and 
    6) forecast Peninsula-wide changes in the relative balance between the three pygoscelid penguin species. 
Describing more precisely how the warming Peninsula climate effects change — e.g. whether or not detected penguin population changes are or may be related to food (krill and fish distribution and abundance), should assist both management of the Antarctic Peninsula and provide information critical to the estimation and management of krill in the adjacent areas of the Southern Ocean. 
The ASI is the only project monitoring penguin and seabird populations throughout the Peninsula, and the only project regularly censusing the species-diverse, environmentally sensitive tourism sites now subject to site visitation guidelines adopted at the last three ATCMs. Because the number of visiting cruise/tour ships, the sizes of such ships, and the number of visitors ashore continues to rise, this approach uniquely assists Parties in determining whether any observed changes are Peninsula-wide trends, site-specific aberrations, and whether and how changes in penguin and seabird populations may relate to climate or other broader changes in this region. 

Logistics
As noted above, the ASI places research teams aboard cruise/tour vessels, yachts, and government research vessels operating in the Peninsula during the austral spring and summer. The cruise/tour ships and yachts are selected carefully, working only with those with the long and diverse Peninsula itineraries, whose Initial Environmental Evaluations have been reviewed by national authorities, and whose operations and expedition personnel enable ASI researchers to reach and census as many sites as possible during each field season.
Geographic Coverage, Methodology
The ASI now divides the Antarctic Peninsula into seven regions12 and collects three categories of data and information.13 The ASI’s methodology as initially constituted is fully described in the three editions of the Compendium produced and disseminated by Oceanites.14 As noted above, because the timing of ASI censuses is opportunistic, and because the intention is to analyze decadal scale changes in penguin and seabird populations, data are collected on all ASI site visits and off-peak bias corrections have been developed to ensure the appropriate analysis of all collected data.15 
The ASI is creating fully digitized and annotated GPS maps for all of the locations in the ASI. These maps include both biologically relevant information such as the location and boundaries of breeding bird colonies, as well as information on zodiac landing sites, commonly used visitor trails, locations of historical sites and markers such as cairns and stakes. Where appropriate, map locations are associated with regular and repeated photodocumentation of sensitive features such as moss beds.
With respect to penguins and flying birds, the focus is collecting data on the key biological variables of breeding population size (nest counts) and breeding productivity (number of chicks per active nest), which are the appropriate biological parameters for detecting direct and cumulative impacts on these populations. 
Dissemination of Data and Information, Publications, Education
Data and descriptive information about the ASI are also available on the Oceanites website — www.oceanites.org, and the Oceanites news/content site — “The Oceanites Feed” — http://oceanitesfeed.wordpress.com/, and the new Oceanites iPhone App that is freely available via Apple’s iTunes Store. 
Biological data and site descriptions collected by the ASI have been published and routinely are made available in peer-reviewed papers, government reports, and popular publications, and are available as downloads on the Oceanites website (http://www.oceanites.org/links/) and The Lynch Lab website  (http://lynchlab.com/publications/).
The most recent government report is the Antarctic Peninsula Compendium (3rd edition),16 which covers the 142 sites that have been visited and censused by ASI (ASI) researchers in 17 field seasons from November 1994 through February 2011 — an increase in coverage by 60 sites from the 2nd edition. These 142 locations include sites that are regularly visited by tourists or other visitors, sites with historic census data, national research stations, and a few Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) that are off-limits to tourists that ASI researchers have visited pursuant to appropriate permits under the U.S. Antarctic Conservation Act (see ATCM XXXIV IP23). The Compendium also may be downloaded from the Oceanites website (http://www.oceanites.org/visiting/2011/APC_2011_3rd.pdf) and US Environmental Protection Agency website  (http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/government/international/antarctic-peninsula-compendium-3rd-edition.pdf).
Oceanites also has begun a series of SKYPE classroom sessions with students in the United States, with the intention of extending this internationally in the future. The 12 sessions to date have involved 1st through 6th grade students and between 20-50 students per session.
