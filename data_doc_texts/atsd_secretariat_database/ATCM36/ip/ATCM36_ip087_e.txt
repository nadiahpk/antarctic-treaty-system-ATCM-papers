Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia. Comparison of the last five Austral summer seasons








Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia. Comparison of the last five Austral summer seasons
Summary
According to the data in IP 119 (2009)1, IP 129 (2010)2, IP 20 (2011)3, IP 88 (2012)4 and IP 86 (2013)5, comparisons on tourist flows that visited Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, from summer season 2008/2009 to the last 2012/2013, are presented. In this respect, information about number of passengers, vessels, registers and tour operators is provided.
With regard to the number of passengers who visited Antarctica
Out of the five seasons being compared, the numbers of passengers to Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia hardly show variations among the first three seasons, being the decrease of 27 % in the number of passengers for the 2011/2012 season quite significant compared to the previous one, even though the number of passengers increased a 24 % in the last season (2012/2013), almost reaching the 2010/2011 figures (See Figure 1).

The most significant difference appears in the ratio between the number of visitors aboard vessels that carried more than 500 passengers, and those that carried up to 500. On one hand, when comparing from the 2008/2009 to the 2010/2011 season, the total number of passengers on board vessels that carried more than 500 passengers has increased, while it has notably decreased in the 2011/2012 season. In this regard, there has been a reduction of 75%6 of visitors when comparing 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons (See Figure 2). However, the number of passengers on board vessels that carried more than 500 visitors increased 50% in the last season over the 2011/2012 season. 
On the other hand, vessels that carried up to 500 passengers show more moderate fluctuations, with a gradual decrease between the following seasons: 2008/2009 - 2009/2010 (- 15%) and 2009/2010 - 2010/2011 (- 14%), whereas the number of passengers grew in the 2011/2012 season (8%), as well as in the last season (8 %). (See Figure 2).

With regard to the number of vessels that traveled to Antarctica
It may also be noted that the number of vessels which operated in Antarctica decreased throughout these four seasons in a 30%7, passing from 36 in 2008/2009 to 25 in 2011/2012 and then it increased in one vessel for the last season (2012/2013). Vessels which carried up to 500 passengers showed a similar behaviour. Nevertheless, the ones that carried more than 500 passengers increased during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons, to finally decrease in the last two seasons. (See Table 1 and Figure 3)

With regard to the registers of vessels
Most of the vessels that operated during these five seasons were registered in countries or territories which are not Antarctic Treaty Parties (See Figure 4).
In this regard, out of the total number of vessels that operated Antarctic tourism through Ushuaia during the 2008/2009 season, registers from Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties accounted for 39%. For the following season the percentage increased to 43% and then it went down to 38%; then it reached a 44% in the 2011/2012 season; finally, in the last season, it reached 38 %, with practically the same registers as in the previous season (2011/2012). Throughout the five seasons a total of 6 registers belonging to Parties have been identified, being the participation of registers of Russian Federation quite significant in the first two seasons, although they decreased to 3 in the last two seasons. (See Table 2).
With regard to registers of vessels that do not belong to an Antarctic Treaty Party a total of 16 have been identified in the last season, showing a slight increase with respect to the previous season. Bahamas shows a significant representation, even though it has fallen in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons, it recovered with 10 registered vessels in the last season. Likewise, a total of 13 registers belonging to Non-Treaty Parties have been identified for the whole period of analysis (2008/2009 to 2012/2013) (See Table 2).

With regard to tour operators 
Tour operators have shown a decrease with regard to their participation in Antarctic tourism operations8 through Ushuaia between the 2008/2009 and the 2011/2012 season, increasing in the last season (See Figure 5). In turn, companies located in countries which are Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties sum up 22 for the last season, whereas 2 are located in a country which is not a Consultative Party (Canada).
