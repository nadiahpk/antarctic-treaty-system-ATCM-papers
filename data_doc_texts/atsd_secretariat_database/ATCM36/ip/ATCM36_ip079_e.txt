Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

Information Paper submitted by Australia, France and Spain

Summary

This paper reports on representations conducted by Consultative Parties in accordance with Resolution 1 (2012) to encourage the 15 States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but are not yet Party to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (“Madrid Protocol”) to become Party to it. Among these 15 Non-Consultative Parties, 7 have already signed the Madrid Protocol1 but have not yet ratified it (Annex 2) and 8 others have not signed nor ratified the Protocol. In late 2012, Australia, France and Spain, together with 18 other Consultative Parties (Annex 1)2, conducted representations to encourage these 15 States to become Party to the Protocol.
All States approached expressed support for the objectives and principles of the Protocol. A number of States are actively working to become Party to the Protocol or have decided to do so, but others said that so far they did not currently intend to become Party to the Protocol.

Background

Pursuant to the conclusions of ATCM XXXIV and Resolution 1 (2011), Australia, France and Spain submitted WP31 Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty at ATCM XXXV. This document presented the results of the representations undertaken during the preceding intersessional period to encourage those States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Protocol on Environmental Protection (“Madrid Protocol) to become Party to it. Considering not all States were able to commit to accession and/or ratification at that time, ATCM XXXV decided to remain seized of the issue. The meeting agreed that further representations were required and welcomed the offer of Australia, France and Spain to again coordinate representations during the 2012-2013 intersessional period (final report 35 to 42).

The ATCM adopted Resolution 1 (2012) that recommended that:

    1. “the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting remain seized of the need to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties, but not yet Party to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, to accede to the Protocol;
    2. further representations are required in following up activities conducted in the 2011-2012 ATCM intersessional period to make progress towards increasing the number of Parties to the Protocol;
    3. Consultative Parties be invited to update future ATCMs, as appropriate, on this matter; and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat post the text of Resolution 1 (2011) on its website in a way that makes clear that it is no longer current.”


Preparation and conduct of the representations in the intersessional period 

In conducting the representations during the 2012-2013 intersessional period, Australia, France and Spain drew on the comprehensive aide-mémoire developed for the first round of representations in 2011/12 (i.e. the document circulated by the Secretariat to all Consultative Parties in Circular 7/2012). Australia, France and Spain also provided further documentation and information on the Madrid Protocol to answer specific questions raised by the 15 relevant States in the first round of representations.

Resolution 1 (2012) and paragraph 41 of ATCM XXXV Final Report gave a mandate to Australia, France and Spain to continue to coordinate intersessional work with other Consultative Parties, to carry out new representations to follow-up on the encouragement to the 15 relevant Non-Consultative Parties to become Parties to the Madrid Protocol on behalf of the ATCM as a whole. Representations were coordinated by Australia, France and Spain, together with 18 other Consultative Parties, between September and December 2012 in the capitals of the 15 non-Consultative Parties. Answers from these States were received up until March 2013.

Outcomes of the representations

a)	Overall, the 15 non-consultative Parties approached reaffirmed their support for the objectives and principles of the Madrid Protocol.

b)	Four of the States advised that they were actively preparing for ratification or accession; two States had initiated the process of accession; two others were confident this process could be completed over the coming months. 

c)	Five other States expressed their interest in the Antarctic environment and their willingness to consider becoming Parties to the Madrid Protocol in the longer term. Two of these States were already planning internal consultations on the Protocol while the three others noted they would seek information from the Consultative Parties to prepare their accession or ratification.

d)	The six other States advised that they did not did not intend to become Parties and/or ratify the Madrid Protocol at this time. States underlined the complexity of implementing the Madrid Protocol due to the number of topics it deals with and the challenges in transcribing the Protocol and its annexes into domestic legislation. Possible budgetary implications were also a concern for some States.

Generally speaking, the support to the Protocol and commitment to ratify or accede it appeared better than during the previous round of demarches, in terms of number of States that now consider becoming Party to it and considering the fact that some States that expressed reluctance during the previous demarches now seem more inclined to become party to the Protocol.
Follow-up

Australia, France and Spain were encouraged by the support expressed by States for the objectives and principles of the Protocol and by the intention of some States to become Parties and/or accede to the Madrid Protocol. Given that not all states were able to commit to accession and/or ratification at this time, it remains important for the Consultative Parties to continue to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Madrid Protocol to become Party to the Protocol, consistent with Resolution 1 (2012). Consistent with Resolution 1 (2012), Australia, France and Spain intend to pursue further representations and would welcome the participation of other parties. 

In line with Resolution 1 (2012), Australia, France and Spain propose to coordinate a new round of representations in the forthcoming intersessional period, open to all Consultative Parties, to renew the message to the 15 Non-Consultative Parties and stand ready to assist in providing further information on the content and the enforcement of the Protocol and its annexes. Australia, France and Spain propose to report on behalf of all Consultative Parties to ATCM XXXVII. 
These proposals are consistent with the commitment made by all Parties in the 2011 Declaration and reaffirmed by Resolution 1 (2012).
