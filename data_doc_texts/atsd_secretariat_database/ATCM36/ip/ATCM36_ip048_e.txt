Permit for the Activity of the Russian Antarctic Expedition in 2013-17
In accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Federal Law “On regulation of activities of the Russian citizens and the Russian legal entities in the Antarctic” of 5 June 2012 (IP-71, XXXV ATCM), an order of carrying out  activity in the Antarctic by the Russian citizens and Russian legal entities was developed in Russia. One of the main documents to be granted the Permission is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the declared type of activity. In compliance with this procedure, the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE), which is within the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring has prepared in 2012 the Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) for all types of activity planned in the expedition for 5 years from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 and submitted them to the Inter-Agency Commission for Consideration of Applications for Activity in the Antarctic and Granting Expert Conclusions. 
For direct study of the water body and bottom of Lake Vostok and for the new types of activity not included to this IEE, separate EIAs will be prepared.   
The IEE structure is as follows:
