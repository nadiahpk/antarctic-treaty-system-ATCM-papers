Report of Russia – US joint Antarctic Inspection, November 29 – December 6, 2012
From November 29 – December 6, 2012 the Russian Federation and the United States of America conducted the second phase of the Joint Inspection in Antarctica. The first phase of that Inspection took place from 23 to 28 January 2012 (see XXXV ATCM IP47 United States-Russian Federation Report of Inspection). The inspection was conducted pursuant to Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty of 1991.
The joint inspection team consisted of eight officially designated observers: four from Russia and four from the USA. On the US side three observers from the inspection team came from the Department of State of the United States of America and one observer from the United States National Science Foundation, on the Russia side there were two observers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and two observers from the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.
The first phase of the inspection was supported logistically by the United States’ National Science Foundation and the U.S. Antarctic Program, specifically McMurdo Station, whereas for phase two of the inspection the essential support was provided by Russia’s Antarctic stations Novolazarevskaya (NOVO) and Progress. During the seven-day joint inspection the Russian–U.S. inspection team visited the following stations: Maitri (India), Zhongshan (China), Bharati (India), Syowa (Japan), Princess Elisabeth (Belgium), and Troll (Norway), located in the Eastern part of Antarctica in Dronning Maud Land, Princess Elizabeth Land and Enderby Land. Ground and aviation transportation was provided for the most part by the Russian Antarctic Expedition. 
After preparing the draft inspection report the Russian Federation and the United States circulated relevant chapters through diplomatic channels to India, China, Japan, Belgium and Norway (as well as by e-mail to relevant officials) in order to give these States Parties to the above mentioned Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol an opportunity to comment. Comments received by 3 April 2013 were taken into account by the Russian Federation and the United States of America. 
The members of the joint inspection team came together in Cape Town on 27 November 2012 and flew to the Russian station Novolazarevskaya on an Ilyushin-76 aircraft which made an intercontinental flight from South Africa to Antarctica within the framework of the international air corporate network DROMLAN. The joint inspection team arrived at NOVO station on 30 November and in the afternoon observed Maitri station (India), located several kilometers away from NOVO. On the next day using BT-67 Turbo Basler aircraft the inspection team flew to Russia’s Progress station’s ice runway with a stopover for refueling at the S17 field ice airstrip operated by the Japanese Antarctic Expedition. On 2 December by means of ground transportation the inspection team visited China’s Zhongshan station located at Prydz Bay which is several kilometers away from Russia’s Progress station. On the next day the inspection team traveled by helicopter kindly provided by the Indian Antarctic Program to India’s newly constructed Bharati station. On 4 December the inspection team landed at S17 field ice airstrip and after that were transported by Pisten Bullies kindly provided by the Japanese Antarctic program to Japan’s Syowa station in Antarctica. On the second half of that day the inspection of Syowa took place and the inspection team stayed overnight at Syowa. On 5 December the observers flew to Belgium’s Princess Elisabeth station, conducted the inspection of that station and on the same day returned to NOVO. The following morning the inspection team flew to Norway’s Troll station. Having conducted the inspection of Troll the joint inspection team returned to NOVO ice airstrip in the afternoon of the same day and in a couple of hours flew to Cape Town on Ilyushin-76 aircraft. From 7 to 9 December the inspection team analyzed the results of the inspection and drafted the report.
The main conclusions of phase two of the Russia–U.S. Joint Inspection are as follows:
    • The inspection team had an opportunity to visit a broad cross section of different stations, including newly constructed and long-established, small and large, and station with various levels of government funding. All were found to be very highly functioning and generally compliant with Parties’ obligations under the Antarctic Treaty and its Environmental Protocol.
    • The inspection team found that some station personnel lacked familiarity with the Annex 1 of the Protocol regarding Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures. While personnel generally understood the EIA requirement, stating that the EIAs are being done by the involved government and that they are directly involved in the process, some individuals were unfamiliar with previously conducted assessments or future plans for EIAs for station or expedition activities. This included at stations that were currently undergoing construction works. In some cases, station leaders in particular would benefit from a more in-depth understanding of this Annex of the Protocol given its direct connection to station operations and Parties’ obligations to comply with this Annex.
    • Most of the stations inspected currently conduct or have plans to conduct environmental monitoring to investigate the impact of station activities on its surroundings. Monitoring of key environmental indicators is required by Article 5 of Annex 1 of the Protocol following completion of a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE), but more broadly environmental monitoring of potential impacts of stations’ activities, such as wastewater discharge, emissions, physical disturbance, impacts on local fauna and flora, etc. are a best practice that more stations should consider adopting as part of their scientific activities.
    • The inspection team notes that there are non-governmental entities conducting activities at some stations, notably the non-profit entity the International Polar Foundation that operates Princess Elisabeth and the for-profit quasi-governmental Kongsberg Satellite Services’ (KSAT) which has operations at Troll. These examples present somewhat new variations on non-governmental activities at science stations, and the latter presents a type of large-scale commercial activity that some may choose to replicate in other contexts in the future. The interrelationship between government and non-government actors at government-owned Antarctic research stations presents a policy issue worth considering.
The inspection team was grateful for the cooperation provided by all six inspected stations.
