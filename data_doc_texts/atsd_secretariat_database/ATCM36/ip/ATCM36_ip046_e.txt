Report of the Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 6 Larsemann Hills Management Group
Information Paper submitted by Australia, China, India, Russian Federation
Summary
Following the adoption of Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 6 Larsemann Hills at ATCM XXX, the Parties active in the Larsemann Hills established a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the ASMA Management Plan. This paper gives a brief report on the Management Group’s activities during 2012-13.
Introduction
At CEP X Australia, China, India, Romania and the Russian Federation submitted ATCM XXX/WP 8 Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, Antarctic Specially Managed Area Management Plan. The CEP and ATCM endorsed the joint proposal to designate a new ASMA in the Larsemann Hills, which was adopted as ASMA 6 by Measure 2 (2007). The Management Plan aims to protect the Larsemann Hills environment by promoting cooperation and coordination among the Parties planning and conducting activities in the Area. Consistent with the approach taken for several other ASMAs, the Parties active in the Area have established a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the Management Plan. Reports on the Management Group’s activities have been presented in joint Information Papers to CEP-XI (IP-17), CEP-XII (IP-54), CEP-XIII (IP-40), CEP-XIV (IP-79) and CEP XV (IP-61).
Information exchange
Members of the Larsemann Hills ASMA Management Group met in the margins of the COMNAP meeting held in Portland, USA in July 2012. The meeting was chaired by India and attended by representatives from Australia (Australian Antarctic Division), China (Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration, and Polar Research Institute of China), India (National Centre for Oceanographic and Antarctic Research) and the Russian Federation (Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute). A representative from Romania was unable to attend. Reports of the previous year (2011-12) and activities to be undertaken during 2012-13 were discussed by members.
Members of the Group exchanged information on operational and scientific activities. Notably, India updated the Group on the first over-winter operation of its new research station, Bharati; the Russian Federation reported on its removal of 200 tonnes of waste from Progress; and China reported on its work investigating routes from Brattnevet to the plateau. 
The work of the Management Group was also progressed during a special workshop hosted by the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St Petersburg from 10 to 12 April 2013, in which Australian, Chinese and Russian representatives advanced the review of the ASMA management plan. Representatives also discussed:
    • the importance of the Larsemann Hills area as the main Antarctic logistics hub for China and the Russian Federation, and the implications of this for the Area;
    • China and the Russian Federation undertaking joint research on the lakes in the vicinity of Progress and Zhongshan;
    • work on the road needed to ensure the safe movement of vehicles from Zhongshan and Progress to the airfield and inland sites; 


    • improving daily inter-station communication on flights planned in the area, and in particular to the Russian airstrip; and 
    • the steps taken by individual programs to minimise introductions of non-native species.
Nomination of Stornes as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area
The Parties active in the Larsemann Hills have decided to nominate Stornes as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) and are submitting a related Working Paper to CEP XVI. The 2007 ASMA management plan identifies Stornes as a Restricted Area, and notes that consideration would be given to the designation of Stornes as an ASPA.
Review of the ASMA management plan
In accordance with the requirements of Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Environmental Protocol, the Parties active in the Larsemann Hills are undertaking a review of the management plan for ASMA 6. This review has involved:
    • updating information on station details to reflect developments since 2007, namely the completion of Bharati, the modernisation of Progress and additional buildings at Zhongshan;
    • the examination of relevant scientific papers published since 2007;
    • further consideration of the Area’s use as a hub for the activities of China and the Russian Federation; 
    • incorporating previously agreed non-native species prevention arrangements (ATCM XXXI/IP17); 
    • making various modifications to the management zones, including changes in the boundary of the Stornes Restricted Area and its designation as an ASPA (see proposal above), and incorporating the provisions for helicopter operations into the section on access to the area, rather than have a dedicated helicopter zone; and
    • the preparation of new maps to reflect changes to the text.
The Management Group aims to finalise the review of the management plan at its next meeting in July 2013, and to submit a revised management plan for consideration at CEP XVII.
