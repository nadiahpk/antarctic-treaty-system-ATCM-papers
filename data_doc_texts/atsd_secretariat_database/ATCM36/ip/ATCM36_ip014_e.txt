Search and Rescue Incidents in the 
Ross Sea Region: 2004 - 2013

    1.0 Introduction

Between 2004 and 2013, 18 Search and Rescue (SAR) incidents have occurred in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica, within the broader region for which New Zealand has Search and Rescue coordination responsibility (NZSRR). 305 lives have been assisted and 33 lives lost. This paper provides a précis of the more significant SAR incidents which have contributed to the development of New Zealand’s response procedures and to the relationship between Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ), Antarctica New Zealand and the United States Antarctic Programme (USAP).

Lessons identified and learned from these SAR incidents are discussed in New Zealand’s Working Paper: Lessons Learned from Search and Rescue Incidents in the Ross Sea Region.

The crew member was evacuated from this Uruguayan fishing vessel to a visiting passenger ship (with doctor aboard).  The passenger ship transferred the patient to Mario Zucchelli Station, who was then flown to McMurdo Station, transferred to a US C130 aircraft and flown to Christchurch for admission to hospital.

This Sea Shepherd vessel issued a Distress three hours after losing contact with their inflatable tender, which had two crew aboard conducting protest operations against the Japanese whaling fleet. A Japanese ship and another Sea Shepherd vessel assisted with search operations.  RCCNZ obtained a surface picture via Inmarsat SafetyNET of vessels in the vicinity, and a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Orion aircraft was preparing to launch from New Zealand. Three hours after notification to RCCNZ the missing tender was located.

This Japanese whaling ship issued a Distress via Inmarsat C, then by HF DSC (Digital Selective Calling) following a fire on the factory deck.  Through Inmarsat SafetyNET RCCNZ tasked the closest known vessel (ETA 48 hours), however this vessel was ultimately not required as the other three vessels in the Japanese fleet assisted with fire fighting and evacuation of non-essential personnel. Fire crews noted the roof of the factory space had collapsed, which was where the body of the missing crew member was located.

This UK flagged fishing vessel was adrift in the ice pack and required delivery of spare parts.  The company initially coordinated their own commercial air drop from Australia, but when arrangements could not be made RCCNZ was asked to facilitate contact between the vessel owner and the US military, which arranged an air drop of engine parts.

Inmarsat SafetyNET
This Japanese whaling ship reported losing a crewmember overboard, last seen on deck seven hours before RCCNZ was notified.  Inmarsat SafetyNET broadcasts revealed no vessels in the area other than those from the Japanese fleet already searching.  While a RNZAF P3 Orion could have reached the distress position from New Zealand, it would not have had the endurance to conduct an effective search.  The significant time already spent in the minus 1.4°Celsius water, lack of thermal protection and absence of near-by aerial search assistance provided a very low probability of success for this mission.

This Bahaman flagged passenger ship was near the Balleny Islands in the Australian SRR when a crewmember suffered a crushed hand.  It was considered in the patient’s best interest for the ship to transit to New Zealand, and RCCNZ coordinated helicopter evacuation once within range of the New Zealand coast.

RCCNZ was notified of the sinking of this Korean fishing vessel six hours after the incident.  The alert took a circuitous route from another Korean vessel, to the company in Korea then through agencies in New Zealand, by which time another vessel in the fleet had rescued some survivors.  This delay in alerting subsequently delayed the tasking of nearby vessels and eliminated the effectiveness of aerial search assistance.

This Norwegian flagged yacht sunk in the McMurdo Sound area.  Following an alert from the vessel’s EPIRB, RCCNZ coordinated the search for the missing crew which involved a Royal New Zealand Naval ship, two private vessels (and helicopter from one of these ships) and logistical support from the US and New Zealand Antarctic programmes.  While the damaged life raft was located and retrieved, there was no sign of the missing crew.

This Russian fishing vessel was holed and taking on water.  A US LC130 aircraft conducted an initial overfly to establish contact and survey the situation.  A number of vessels responded to SafetyNET broadcasts by RCCNZ, but none were able to reach the Sparta.  RCCNZ coordinated two air drops of pumps and equipment by RNZAF aircraft.  Through an arrangement between Russian and Korean governments, the Korean ship Araon with ice breaking capability was tasked from New Zealand, and once repairs were effected on Sparta escorted the vessel to open water.

After monitoring radio traffic from the Korean fishing fleet, a New Zealand fishing vessel in the Ross Sea notified RCCNZ of a fire aboard this Korean fishing vessel.  A number of vessels responded to RCCNZ SafetyNET broadcasts, while the Korean fleet were soon alongside to rescue the surviving crew.  A US research ship with medical facilities was tasked to uplift the injured for transport to McMurdo Station.  The USAP arranged for the patients to be triaged before loading onto a US LC130 aircraft for transport to hospital in Christchurch.  The remaining crew were taken by the Korean research ship to New Zealand.

This Canadian registered aircraft crashed just below the summit of Mt Elizabeth in the Trans Antarctic Mountain Range.  The ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter) provided an initial alert and position, which was corroborated by a tracking device aboard the aircraft.  The SAR response in Antarctica was coordinated by the USAP and Antarctica New Zealand, while RCCNZ coordinated the liaison between national and international agencies.  Efforts to reach the crash site were thwarted by weather and terrain.  Once access to the site was possible it was evident that the crash was not survivable.
