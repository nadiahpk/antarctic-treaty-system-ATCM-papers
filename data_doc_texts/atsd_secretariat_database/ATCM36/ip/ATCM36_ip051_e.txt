SAR-WG: Overview of search and rescue conventions and international guidelines applicable to the Antarctic  
Information Paper submitted by Australia
Summary of international conventions that are relevant to Search and Rescue (SAR)
To assist in understanding the international SAR framework a summary of relevant conventions and international guidelines is provided in this information paper. 
These international conventions and guidelines apply worldwide and are the basis from which  SAR arrangements for maritime and aviation incident response and relevant procedures are developed. This paper details the roles and functions of the nations that, in this case, have SAR coordination obligations for the Antarctic region, derived from these conventions and associated international guidelines.
 Three international conventions deal with search and rescue and the obligations to render assistance to persons in distress in maritime and aviation incidents and are applicable to the Antarctic, including:
    • The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (as amended) (the SOLAS Convention); 
    • The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979 (the SAR Convention); and
    • The Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944 (as amended) (the Chicago Convention).
The SOLAS Convention which was first to deal with maritime search and rescue covers a range of safety issues, such as ship construction, carriage of cargoes and dangerous cargoes and radio communications but only addresses SAR in a small part.  As a result, it was agreed that a stand-alone convention be introduced dealing specifically with maritime search and rescue, resulting in the SAR Convention.  While the Chicago Convention is similar to the SOLAS Convention in many respects, for example dealing with agreed standards for operations of aircraft, airworthiness of aircraft and communications, it covers search and rescue in more detail than the SOLAS Convention.  Annex 12 of the Chicago Convention is, in many respects, similar to the SAR Convention. 
SOLAS Convention
Chapter V of the Annex to the SOLAS Convention which deals with ‘Safety of Navigation’ requires the master of a ship in a position to be able to provide assistance, on receiving information that persons are in distress at sea, is “bound to proceed with all speed to their assistance”, regardless of the nationality or status of such persons or the circumstances in which they are found.  The master’s obligation is limited to assist without serious danger to his or her own ship, crew or passengers.  
In addition, each Party to the SOLAS Convention “undertakes to ensure that necessary arrangements are made for distress communication and coordination in their area of responsibility and for the rescue of persons in distress at sea around its coasts”.  
SAR Convention
The SAR Convention sets out the arrangements for the provision and co-ordination of maritime search and rescue services.  The SAR Convention defines ‘Search and Rescue Service’ as “the performance of distress monitoring, communication, coordination and search and rescue functions, including provision of medical advice, initial medical assistance, or medical evacuation, through the use of public and private resources including cooperating aircraft, vessels and other craft and installations”.
The Convention sets out the obligation for maritime SAR in the Articles followed by the operative provisions in five chapters in the Annexes and are summarised below:
    • Chapter 1 sets out definitions. A ‘search and rescue region’ is defined as “an area of defined dimensions associated with a rescue co-ordination centre within which search and rescue services are provided” and ‘Rescue co-ordination centre’ is defined as “a unit responsible for promoting efficient organisation of search and rescue services and for co-ordinating the conduct of search and rescue operations within a search and rescue region”. 
    • Chapter 2 deals with State Parties’ responsibilities for the organisation and co-ordination of a SAR incident. This covers arrangements for providing search and rescue services to ensure assistance is rendered to any person in distress at sea.  It provides that Parties shall set up a framework to establish the elements of a SAR service, establish appropriate procedures for coordinating a SAR service, establish rescue coordination centres and provide equipment to SAR units. 
    • Chapter 3 deals with cooperation between nations.  It provides that parties will cooperate and provide assistance when requested.  It also provides for co-operation to provide a place of safety for disembarking people with a minimum of further deviation from the master’s route. 
    • Chapter 4 sets out the operating procedures, including preparatory measures, information gathering, phases of emergency, procedures to be followed, on-scene coordination and termination of searches.
    • Chapter 5 provides for ship reporting systems.
Chicago Convention
    • The Chicago Convention which sets out the regime for aviation SAR also has the formal clauses in the Convention, followed by the operative provisions in the Annexes.  Annex 12 covers search and rescue and several of the other Annexes have some relevance to aviation SAR. The operative provisions provide: Chapter 1 sets out definitions; with terms common with the SAR Convention defined in identical terms, including the definitions for ‘Search and rescue service’, ‘Search and rescue region (SRR)’ and RCC as set out in the SAR Convention. 
    • Chapter 2 deals with ‘Organization’ and provides State Parties shall “individually or in cooperation with other States, arrange for the establishment and prompt provision of search and rescue services within their territories to ensure that assistance is rendered to persons in distress”. Such services shall be provided on a 24-hour basis. It also recommends cooperation and establishment of joint facilities with maritime search and rescue services. This chapter generally provides for similar frameworks to those set out in Chapter 2 of the Annex to the SAR Convention.
    • Chapter 3 deals with cooperation between Nations States and cooperation with other services.
    • Chapter 4 sets out the ‘Preparatory Measures’ to be undertaken, including plans for operation.  
    • Chapter 5 sets out the operating procedures during each of the emergency phases. 
Other annexes also include material relevant to SAR operations and deals with alerting services for all aircraft.  This deals with emergency alerting for aircraft within a flight information region or control areas and sets out procedures for notifying the relevant RCC.
International Guidelines
The conventions described above set out the obligation for signatories; there are many practical aspects that facilitate Parties’ implementation of systems to meet the associated international responsibilities but three international aspects are summarised below.
Search and rescue regions
Both the IMO and ICAO sponsor global SAR Plans allocating search and rescue regions (SRRs) to nations so that a national SAR authority is identified as having responsibility for the coordination of search and rescue of any person within every region on earth. SRRs were developed by the ICAO and IMO in consultation with member Parties and often reflected existing flight regions and proximity to countries as a basis for establishment.
For example, Australia’s SRR was originally based upon the Australian Flight Information Region.  The aviation region was accepted for maritime SAR and the regions for both functions now generally have the same coordinates.  The aviation and maritime SAR region boundaries for Australia differ over Antarctica.  The maritime SAR region extends to the Antarctic coast whilst the aviation SAR region extends to the South Pole.
International Aviation and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual 
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) cooperate in relation to SAR and have produced the IAMSAR Manual to provide assistance to States to meet their own search and rescue needs and to provide guidance on meeting their obligations under the three Conventions.  The IAMSAR Manual is in three volumes and provides guidelines for a common aviation and maritime approach to organizing and providing SAR services. 
For example, Australia has established a national SAR service that involves Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities and organisations: Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Australian Defence Force at the Commonwealth level; and the relevant police service at the State and Territory level, are the relevant SAR Authorities within Australia.
A SAR Arrangement
A SAR Arrangement is an arrangement between countries put into place in accordance with both the SAR and Chicago Conventions and is used to outline procedures to effectively conduct SAR response across SRR boundaries and confirm coordination arrangements.  One basic principle covered is that the first RCC to learn of a distress situation will retain coordination and commence response operations until the RCC that is responsible for the SRR can take overall coordination. In addition, SAR Arrangements are lodged with the IMO and ICAO.
For example, Australia maintains numerous SAR agreements with neighbouring countries with responsibility for SAR response. This includes both South Africa and New Zealand which have adjoining SRR’s in the Antarctic.
