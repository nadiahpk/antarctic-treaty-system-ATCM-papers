Deception Island Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management Group Report
Information Paper 
Submitted by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, the UK and the USA

1. Introduction
Deception Island was formally adopted as Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No. 4 by Measure 3 (2005). Working Paper XXVIII ATCM/WP 20 and Information Papers XII SATCM/IP8, XXIV ATCM/IP63, XXV ATCM/IP28 and XXVI ATCM/IP48 summarise the extensive consultation amongst those Parties with major interests in Deception Island, and the process that lead to its adoption as an ASMA.
Following the formal adoption of ASMA No. 4, XXIX ATCM/IP19, and subsequent IPs, reported on the establishment of a Management Group to oversee the implementation of the plan and on the success of the Deception Island Management Group (DIMG) to effectively resolve the previously reported conflicts between science and tourism. 
XXX ATCM IP108, ATCM XXXI IP126, ATCM XXXII IP112, ATCM XXXIII IP 16, ATCM XXXIV IP 131 and ATCM XXXV IP 82 has provided annual updates on activities undertaken on Deception Island during the 2006/2007 to 2011/2012 austral summers, and informed the Meeting of the intersessional work of the DIMG.  
The present Information Paper summarizes the activities undertaken within the Deception Island Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), and the work of the Management Group to fulfil the objectives and principles of ASMA No. 4 Management Plan during the intersessional period (2012-2013).  
2.  Overview of Activities on Deception Island 2012/13
2.1 Science and Logistics 
    • Argentina: During the past season, Argentina continued with research on volcanological studies around the island. The activities were carried out from mid-December to the end of February. The work was based out from Decepción Station, and was led by Dr. Alberto Caselli. under the project “Volcanology and geomorphological study of active volcanoes in Antarctica and the Andes"
Decepción Station was open during the same time period, given logistical support to the scientific project.
    • Chile: During this season, Chile developed scientific activities with the support of the Spanish Station, Gabriel de Castilla, and on board the Chilean Navy ship “Aquiles”. Since January 28th, three projects worked in Deception Island with the support of the Spanish Program:
    • DIAZOSPRING: Ecology of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in hot springs along a latitudinal gradient from Atacama to Antarctica.
    • DIAZOPOLARSEA: Marine diazotrophy in the Southern Ocean.
    • Factors involved in a cyano-lichen association: availability, specificity and selectivity. 
The projects considered to developed activities in ASPA Nº 140 and were carrying in the appropriate permit. 
In February 21st and 22nd 2013, using the Chilean Navy ship “Aquiles” as platform, seven other projects were developed, which visited the area just for several hours:
    • Addressing biogeographic and phylogeographic scenarios regarding origin and persistence of macro-algal floral diversity in Sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions using taxonomic, ecophysiological and molecular approaches.
    • High latitude meiofaunal macro-ecology and diversity assessed using both morphological and molecular techniques.
    • Influence of freshwater flow on primary productivity, biogenic silica content and nutrients in South Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula.
    • Isolation of Antarctic microorganisms able to synthesize highly fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles (Quantum Dots) for biotechnological applications.
    • Selection and identification of microbial consortiums with high acidogenic and methanogenic activity from Antarctic sediments, for application to psychrophilic wastewater anaerobic digestion under temperate to cold climates.
    • Using natural compounds from Antarctic actinomycetes to increase food safety in processing and refrigerated plants.
    • Diversity of cyanobacteria in the Antarctic Peninsula
The last four projects developed activities in some of the sites of ASPA Nº 140, with the appropriate permits.
    • Spain: The Spanish Antarctic Station Gabriel de Castilla opened from December 23th 2012 to February  25th 2013.  Eight scientific projects were carried out during this time, one project included diving activity, five projects had permit to visit ASPA 140 and two of them to visit ASPA 145. The Spanish projects were:
    • Ecological activity of Antarctic benthic marine natural products: chemical ecology in situ, pharmacological potential and alterations caused by human activity. (Included diving activity)
    • Parasites, immune response and oxidative stress in Antarctic penguins: contribution to the knowledge of global change effects (PINGUCLIM III).
    • Geomorphology, relief evolution, periglacial environment and hydrogeology: changes and impacts in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region (GEOPANT).
    • Analysis of volcanic hazards in Deception Island.
    • Lithological and chronostratigraphic studies of recent sedimentary units in Port Foster.
    • Surveillance of volcanic activity at Deception Island: deformation parameters and thermal anomalies.
    • Maintenance and update of CALM and TPS stations on Livingston and Deception islands, Antarctica. 
    • Volcanic activity at Deception island surveillance: Seismic activity monitoring.
    • United Kingdom: The United Kingdom's ice patrol vessel, HMS Protector, visited Deception Island three times in the 2012-13 season. Her activity included: a formal Antarctic Treaty Inspection of cruise vessels; informal visits to Decepcion and Gabriella de Castilla stations; a recreational visit to Whalers' Bay; and the carrying out of magnetic observations.
    •  United States: Researchers from the US NGO Oceanites/ Antarctic Site Inventory team made two visits to Deception Island.  The first visit was to Entrance Point on December 21, 2012 from the Akademik Ioffee. The second visit was on Jan 9 2013 from the MV Ortelius.
    • Norway: A representative from the Norwegian Polar Institute visited Deception Island in January 2013 as part of an assessment of the activities of the Norwegian Antarctic cruise operator Hurtigruten. The ship visited Deception Island on 29 January and landings were made at Whalers Bay and Telefon Bay. 
2.2 Tourist Activities
Tourism numbers from IAATO were not finalised by the time of writing of the information paper and IAATO will provide the DIMG with tourism numbers and a report as soon as they are available.
3. Work of the Deception Island Management Group (2012-2013)
Chairmanship
The Deception Island Management Group under the Terms of Reference of the Management Group, has decided that Chairmanship of the group shall rotate every two years among the six member Parties. 
After United Kingdom, Argentina and Spain having completed their two years, Norway took over the chairmanship mid 2011 (in conjunction with the ATCM XXXIV in Buenos Aires), and has continued to hold this position until now. The Chairmanship will be handed on in mid-2013, likely in conjunction with CEP XVI.
Work plan
After the completion of the comprehensive review of the Deception Island management package from 2005 in the 2011-12 season (with adoption of revised plan at ATCM XXXV), the tasks of the DIMG has been more limited in the 2012-13 season.  
In the context of the management plan review it was noted that there are concerns with respect to Baily Head and the Chinstrap penguin rookery there (largest in Deception Island and one of the largest in Antarctica). A substantial decrease in the population has been observed at this site, which may require some changes to, or strengthening of, the protection and management of this zone. The DIMG has in the 2012-13 season continued discussions on this topic and on basis of this has submitted revised visitor site guidelines for consideration of CEP XVI (WP 46). There are still unresolved issues on this topic, and discussions will continue also in the year(s) to come. 
DIMG has been informed about observations made at Deception Island that indicate that there are instances where visiting personnel are not aware of or disregard the management provisions of ASMA # 4 during their visit at Deception Island. The origin of the personnel involved in one of the reported incidents is not known yet, while another observed incident involved personnel associated with a national program (of a country not member of DIMG). DIMG does want to see and ensure that all visitors behave in accordance with the adopted management framework during their visits in Deception Island, and will discuss further the need to disseminate information about the relevant management provisions to various groups of users and/or how to follow up on concrete observation that have been reported.
DIMG has also in the 2012-13 season initiated a review of the website of ASMA # 4 (www.deceptionisland.aq). Further work is required, and the review will continue into the 2013-14 season.
The work plan for DIMG includes the following issues that may receive more focus in the next period:
    • Exchange of information and archiving of information
    • Monitoring issues
