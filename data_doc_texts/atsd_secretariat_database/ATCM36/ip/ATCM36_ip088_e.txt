Areas of tourist interest in the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region. 2012/2013 Austral summer season
Summary
This paper presents a report on the distribution of tourist visits to the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region according to the voyages made by vessels which operated through the port of Ushuaia in the 2012/2013 summer season.
Introduction
Although Antarctica has consolidated as a tourist destination, it is appropriate to emphasize that most programs mainly market the Antarctic Peninsula. In this respect and taking into account that over 90% of the Antarctic shipborne tourist flow operates through the port of Ushuaia, this analysis focuses exclusively on that region.
The Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) are considered as one single region, identifying in turn different areas of tourist interest. To this end, work has been undertaken on the basis of information provided by tour operators in their cruise ship manifests1 to Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Maritime Authority), during the 2012/2013 season. In some cases, the information from these documents was completed with the itineraries published by tour operators.
During the analyzed season a total number of 197 voyages to the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region were made through the port of Ushuaia, run by 26 vessels. Of this total, 192 voyages corresponding to 23 vessels made landings. However, 172 manifests included the voyage plan, that is to say, 89% of the itineraries planned by tour operators were available when vessels departed from the port of Ushuaia. 
Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region and its areas of tourist interest
The Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) are defined as a region from the point of view of tourist visits, acknowledging in turn different areas on the basis of criteria such as geographical proximity and concentration of points of interest.

    1) Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands). 
    2) Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands.
    3) Islas Shetland del Sur (South Shetland Islands).
    4) Northeast of Antarctic Peninsula.
       (Area between Gourdin Islands and Cerro Nevado Island (Snow Hill Island), including Antarctic Strait (Antarctic Sound) and Weddell Sea to the East).
    5) Northwest of Antarctic Peninsula.
(West coast of the Peninsula, along with de la Flota Sea (Bransfield Strait), between Gourdin Island and Mikkelsen Harbour).
    6) Central-West Antarctic Peninsula.
(Between Mikkelsen Harbour and Almirante Brown Station, practically including Palmer Archipelago, with De Gerlache Strait (Gerlache Strait)). 
    7) Southwest of Antarctic Peninsula. 
(Comprising the areas adjacent to Lemaire Channel and to Penola Strait, between Flandes Bay (Flandres Bay) and Beascochea Bay, area of Bellingshausen Sea).
    8) Antarctic Polar Circle

Distribution of visits to different tourist sites according to voyage plans
Taking into account the voyage plan for each vessel at the time of departing, it is found that the most visited areas in the region are the Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and the Central-West Peninsula area, concentrating, in both cases, 81% of voyages; followed by the Southwest of the Peninsula area with 63% and the Northeast of the Peninsula area with 31%. The least frequented areas are Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands, the Northwest of the Peninsula, and Antarctic Polar Circle (See Figure 1).
In addition, within each area it is possible to identify the most frequently visited sites. In this regard, a figure is shown for each area highlighting the sites according to the number of voyages made to that place (See Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). It is worth mentioning that a total of 74 sites were identified for visits during this season.

Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) area
For Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), Orcadas Station at Laurie Island and Monroe Island have been the most visited sites, followed by Signy Station and lastly, Ripio Cove (Shingle Cove). Nevertheless, 6 voyages were made to this area without detailing the site to visit (See Figure 2). The inclusion of this area on the itineraries is related to voyages that, in general, visit other destinations located further North in the Atlantic Ocean and then go around Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and Northeast of Antarctic Peninsula areas, also visiting the Central-West area (See Table 2). This area has 1 site with Site Guidelines for Visitors: Ripio Cove (Shingle Cove).

The most prominent visit site in this area is Wild Cape (Wild Point), mentioned on 20 voyage plans, whereas Vigilante Cape (Lookout Cape) was only mentioned for 4 voyages. Nevertheless, 2 voyage plans referred to Elefante Island (Elephant Island) without mentioning specific visit sites (See Figure 3). As it can be seen from Table 3, most voyages to this area were related to Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Central-West and Northeast Peninsula. This area does not have any Site Guidelines for Visitors.

Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) area
Together with the Central West area, it is the most frequently visited area with several visit sites totaling 17, as clearly shown by Figure 4; Balleneros Cove (Whalers Bay) at Decepción Island (Deception Island) was mentioned on 113 voyage plans, reaching the highest number for this area. Media Luna Island (Half Moon Island) is next in the visiting order. Also, the Shetland del Sur (South Shetland) Archipelago is considered without specifying particular visit sites. This area is closely linked to all others, revealing that one of its visit sites is included almost on every voyage (See Table 4). Out of all the sites which were identified, 10 have Site Guidelines for Visitors: Turret Point, Pingüino Island (Penguin Island), Aitcho Islets, Yankee Harbour, Media Luna Island (Half Moon Island), Hannah Point, Telefon Bay, Balleneros Cove (Whalers Bay) Péndulo Cove (Pendulum Cove) and Rancho Point (Bailey Head), being coincident with the most visited ones.

The Northwest of the Peninsula is the least frequently visited area, presenting only two visit sites, Astrolabe Island and Mikkelsen Harbor, receiving visits from 4 and 14 voyages respectively (See Figure 6). Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that visits to Mikkelsen Harbor are generally associated with Cierva Cove and Hydrurga Rocks which, for the purposes of this report, are part of Central-West Peninsula area. Due to the low frequency registered by this area, it is only associated more significantly with voyages to the Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Central-West and Southwest of Antarctic Peninsula areas (See Table 6). This area has 1 Site Guidelines for Visitors in the sector of Mikkelsen Harbor.

Final considerations
From the analysis of voyage plans presented by tour operators for 2012/2013 season, 8 tourist visit areas were identified at the Antarctic Peninsula and Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands) region. Of these areas, the most frequented are Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) and Central-West, followed by the Southwest Peninsula area. Central-West area contains the visit site with most voyages (Neko Harbor) and others that also received an important amount of visits (Almirante Brown Station, Skontorp Cove and Goudier Island/Port Lockroy, Jougla Point). Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands) area has the second most visited site (Balleneros Cove (Whalers Bay)). Likewise, Southwest area contains two important visit sites, Petermann Island and Pléneau Island, in the vicinity of Lemaire Channel. These 3 areas are, in turn, closely associated among them in connection with voyages combining these spaces. 
On the other hand, the Northeast of the Peninsula area also includes a significant percentage of voyages, associated preferably with areas located to the North of the Peninsula, such as Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), Shetland del Sur Islands (South Shetland Islands), Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands. The Northwest of the Peninsula, Orcadas del Sur Islands (South Orkney Islands), Elefante Island (Elephant Island) and adjacent islands and Antarctic Circle areas were the least visited by tourist voyages. 
Finally, Out of a total number of 74 visit sites distributed in 8 areas, 29 have Site Guidelines for Visitors, being coincident with the most frequently visited places.
