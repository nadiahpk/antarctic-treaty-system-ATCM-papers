Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 117 Avian Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula








Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 117, Avian Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) 117 Avian Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan.
Background
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA 117 Avian Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, with reference to Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011). 
ASPA 117 Avian Island (67°46' S, 68°54' W) is situated just south of Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula. The island was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 30 under Recommendation XV-6 in 1989 after a proposal by the United Kingdom. It was re-designated as a Specially Protected Area (SPA) through Recommendation XVI-4 (1991, SPA No. 21) and was again re-designated by Decision 1 (2002) as ASPA No. 117. 
The primary reason for the designation of Avian Island as ASPA 117 is to protect environmental values and primarily the abundance and diversity of breeding seabirds on the island.    Seven seabird species breed in close proximity within the Area, including large populations of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and blue-eyed cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps).
Summary of amendments
A revised Management Plan for ASPA 117 is provided at Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures. The amendments are summarised as follows:
    • An introduction has been added, including a statement of the primary reason for designation.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to the introduction.
    • A reference to the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to the introduction.
    • A requirement that visitors take precautions against the introduction of non-native organisms to the Area, and guidance on appropriate precautions, has been added to Section 7vi. 
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • Information on bird populations have been updated, where possible (Section 6i).
    • An additional recommended walking route has been added (Section 7ii).
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans and with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
Recommendation
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for ASPA 117 Avian Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula (Attachment A).
