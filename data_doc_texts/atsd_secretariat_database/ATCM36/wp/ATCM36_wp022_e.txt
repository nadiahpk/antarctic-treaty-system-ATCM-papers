Russian Antarctic biogeographic regioning as compared with the New Zealand classification
Resolution 6 (2012) adopted at 35 ATCM is devoted to the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions. As is known, the authors of this Resolution have identified 15 regions of Antarctica: North-East Antarctic Peninsula, South Orkney Islands, North-west Antarctic Peninsula, Central south Antarctic Peninsula, Enderby Land, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, North Victoria Land, South Victoria Land, Transantarctic Mountains, Ellsworth Mountains, Marie Byrd Land, Adelie Land, Ellsworth Land, South Antarctic Peninsula. The Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions were delineated using a grid of 200 km x 200 km squares, the nine ice-free domains identified in the Environmental Domains Analysis for the Antarctic continent, and 22 bioregions identified by the SCAR Regional Sensitivity to Climate Change Program. It is necessary to note a significant contribution of specialists from different countries under the leadership of New Zealand to this multiyear effort started as early as 2005. 
In the late 1960s, the Antarctic biogeographic regioning consisted in delineating the concentric areals of the region with a typical decrease of the number of species of living organisms and the numbers of their population with increasing distance from the coastal marine water areas towards the mainland center. Such areas included: 
    • subantarctic belt with a large diversity of pinnipeds, seabirds, highly-organized dipterans, flowering and herbaceous plants, large diversity of lichen and moss species;
    • coastal Antarctic belt up to several hundred kilometers wide from the coast boundary, characterized by the decrease of biodiversity of pinnipeds, absence of land birds, two species of penguins, absence of flowering plants, restricted number of lichen and moss species;
    • southern inner zone with the absence of fauna (rare visitations of the South Polar skua), complete absence of moss, presence of few lichen species;
    • central area of Antarctica, where the living organisms are represented only by the restricted species of bacteria present on some nunataks and in high mountain oases. 
Further development of biogeographic regioning was related to landscape science of Antarctica. By landscapes one means the isolated regions of the Earth’s physical environment, which are characterized by specific geographic, climatic, geological and biological features and their interaction. The snow-ice cover, which occupies about 99 percents of the territory of the entire sixth continent and significant areas of surrounding waters of the Southern Ocean, has an enormous influence on the Antarctic landscapes. This fact has determined identification of a specific for this region environmental type – glaciosphere. With increasing absolute terrain heights above sea level in Antarctica, vertical natural zones are formed that have no analogues in the natural latitudinal zones of our planet: the Antarctic plateau with the average heights up to 3 thousand meters, the Antarctic slope and the coastal area. In Antarctica, the decisive role in delineating different altitudinal landscape zones belongs to climatic factors. In connection with a different character of the atmospheric circulation in the Antarctic, sedimentation, configuration and orography of the continent, its sectoral character or provinciality of Antarctica are manifested, determining its division into the West and East areas. Besides due to these factors, one identifies the areas of the Antarctic Peninsula, ice shelves and the drifting ice belts of the Southern Ocean and the ice-free water areas. As a result of this time-consuming work, the following types of the Antarctic landscapes were identified by investigators: 
    • Antarctic plateau of East Antarctica;
    • Ice sheet slope of East Antarctica; 
    • Antarctic plateau of West Antarctica;
    • Antarctic slope of West Antarctica;
    • Outlet glaciers and ice falls;
    • Ice shelves;
    • Coastal areas (foot of glaciers);
    • High mountain oases;
    • Low mountain hilly oases;
    • Sub-Antarctic oases;
    • Ice-covered marine areas;
    • Ice-free areas of the Southern Ocean. 
The Antarctic biogeographers began to apply this principle of regioning where a decisive role was given to different geographic landscapes. At the same time this approach continued to develop. In 2005, the volume “Antarctic” was published in the series “Atlas of the Oceans” in the Russian Federation, which presents a map of bioclimatic zones of Antarctica (p. 272). It is based on the information about the peculiarities of the geographic characteristics of bioclimatic zones of Antarctica (glacial plateau, glacial slope, glacial slope foot, drifting ice, open Antarctic zones, temperate climate), their climatic characteristics (height above sea level, average air temperature in winter and summer, number of days in the year with a temperature below -26ºС and -15ºС and above 0ºС, number of days in the year with a wind speed of more than and less than 15 m/s and calm, amount of precipitation, total solar radiation), essential environmental factors (radiation discomfort, recurrence of cyclones in winter and summer, frequency and manifestation of meteotropic reactions, water supply sources, extent of water mineralizing and presence of permanent and temporary human settlements). 
A total of 13 bioclimatic zones were identified:
    • High plateau of East Antarctica;
    • Plateau of West Antarctica;
    • Northern slope of East Antarctica;
    • Inner slope of East Antarctica;
    • Transantarctic mountains;
    • Slope of West Antarctica;
    • Inner ice shelves;
    • Outer ice shelves and ice coast;
    • Antarctic Peninsula;
    • Zone of drifting ice;
    • Antarctic oases;
    • Zone of open Antarctic waters;
    • Zone of temperate climate.
Each of these zones was delineated according to the aforementioned geographic and climatologic characteristics and essential environmental factors. 
Although this regioning is based on he habitation conditions of living organisms and does not use the information on the existing biodiversity, these environmental characteristics can be added within a very short timeframe for defining the general features of different biogeographic areals. 
Note that the Russian approach considers all geographic peculiarities of the Antarctic rather than only the ice-free regions, which gives a possibility of comprehensive understanding of the biogeographic regioning of the Antarctic, where ice and climatic conditions play a special role. 
One should also pay attention to the use of the names of extensive Antarctic areas not corresponding in our opinion to a much smaller area of the conservation biogeographic regions proposed by New Zealand in the text of Resolution 6 (2012).
 The name “Queen Maud Land” or “Enderby Land” means in reality a combination of quite different types of the Antarctic landscapes from the ice shelves to the Antarctic Plateau, and highland oases and lowland hillocky oases. This creates some uncertainty in understanding the dimensions of the geographical object which is designated as the conservation biogeographic region.
The approach proposed by Russia does not aim at negation of the results of the excellent work prepared by New Zealand, but proposes further development of the results obtained by our colleagues. We hope that our proposal will be adopted for development of further studies in this direction that can be carried out on the international basis.
