Identification of potential climate change refugia for emperor penguins: a science-based approach
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
Over the coming century, climate change will probably impact upon emperor penguin distribution range and breeding success in the Antarctic Peninsula region and wider Antarctica. The United Kingdom therefore recommends that CEP endorse the monitoring of emperor penguin colonies using remote sensing techniques to identify potential climate change refugia, and encourages other Parties to undertake similar work in other regions of Antarctica.
Introduction
Recommendation 25 in the final report of the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Climate Change (Svolvær, Norway, 6 – 9 Apr 2010) recommended that CEP consider a systematic approach to protected or managed areas to: protect species, or habitats identified to be of particular risk to climate change; accommodate areas that have potential to be environmental or climate refuges; and set aside areas for future climate change related research, including reference areas.  Furthermore, Recommendation 28 recommended that CEP and SC-CAMLR continue to develop means for collecting and sharing data and information on the status and trends of species of interest to both bodies (seals, penguins and seabirds), including the need to cooperate with other experts bodies such as SCAR and ACAP.  In response to these recommendations, the United Kingdom proposes that remote sensing techniques should be used for identifying potential climate change refugia for emperor penguins. 
Background
Emperor penguins breed in coastal locations around the Antarctic with most colonies assembling on stable fixed or ‘fast’ ice, with just three small colonies (two with the loss of the Dion colony protected within ASPA 107 Emperor Island, Dion Island, Marguerite Bay) occurring on land. All colonies show a similar breeding schedule regardless of colony location. Birds gather in autumn, with the development of stable fast ice, usually from April onwards. Courtship, egg laying and incubation take place as winter proceeds, while hatching, brooding and crèche formation occur as spring and early summer approach. Chicks are tended by both parents until fledging occurs in mid-summer, usually during November or December coincident with the breakup of the stable fast ice into ‘pack’ (i.e. ice floes that drift with the winds and currents); however, chicks may still be fed while taking refuge on drifting ice floes. Adults moult in late summer, during February, again usually on fast ice or on consolidated pack. Thus, emperor penguins depend upon stable fast ice for approximately eight months of the year, so late fast ice formation in winter and/or early breakup in spring can strongly reduce the chances of successful breeding at any given colony location.
Potential climate change impacts
Recently, changes in sea ice duration and distribution, associated with climate change, have been reported as important factors affecting emperor penguin population processes [1-6], with the main drivers of change thought to be reductions in sea ice [6]. Sea ice generally refers collectively to both fast ice and pack ice. Fast ice forms around the fronts of ice shelves, coastlines and between island archipelagos and grounded icebergs. It also forms over shoals or over shallows, and unlike pack ice, fast ice does not move with surface currents or wind [7]. At almost all locations emperor penguins use fast ice as a stable platform on which to breed [6, 8, 9] and since they are not agile, they are restricted to fast ice with a low free-board [4] that does not stand far above the ocean surface by more than a few tens of centimetres. Emperors may forage in polynyas, tide cracks and leads and within the pack ice so other consequences of climate change might also be important, particularly changing relationships with the sea ice community, including with their prey [4] which in most locations are principally Antarctic silverfish and krill [10], or predators.
Notwithstanding, conclusions about emperor penguin biology and ecology in relation to environmental change are limited by a severe lack of long-term population monitoring data and associated environmental data including, inter alia, data on prey species, predation and local and regionally scaled sea ice indices. Detailed demographic studies are currently only available from just one site [1-3] and aerial and ground-based population counts from only a few others. Consequently, without coherent monitoring programmes that examine demographic parameters in the context of a suite of environmental indices, inferences are necessarily limited and some conclusions may be merely correlative. Until more widespread demographic monitoring is available, time series of population counts from additional breeding sites might help increase our understanding about important ecological interactions between population processes and environmental drivers, particularly where population trajectories can be examined in the context of local environmental change.
Proposed research
In this paper we propose that long-term studies of emperor penguins should be conducted so that the impacts of climate change can be better understood. Scientific studies carried out on the ice are logistically difficult and necessarily complex and expensive. Therefore we propose that a series of experimental studies should be set up that utilize recently developed satellite remote-sensing technology [11]. These studies should be designed to report inter-annual variability in population size and to relate this to environmental conditions, including duration and extent of sea ice. Conducting such studies will be best carried out in isolation from other confounding factors, such as the commercial harvesting of species that emperor penguins feed upon. Studies should include areas where climate change impacts are likely to occur, as well as areas that may represent future potential refugia.
A number of emperor colonies are already designated as ASPAs (Table 1); however, these sites do not reflect a coordinated experimental structure and are all found within the East Antarctic between longitudes 60°53’E and 169°21’E. The UK therefore proposes to set up two monitoring transects for emperor penguins that include the colonies identified in Map 1 (and Table 2) to see if any can be identified as potential climate change refugia for emperor penguins with a view to considering whether local area protection would be appropriate in future years. These transects have a strong latitudinal gradient and potentially will help increase understanding about interactions with the environmental drivers affecting emperor penguins. Over the coming years, the UK proposes to generate population estimates for the colonies at these sites, examining inter-annual variability using existing methods [11]. 
Currently, information about how emperor penguins disperse and recruit is lacking, but given the vulnerability of their fast ice breeding habitat to storm action, breeding pairs must move between sites and juveniles may recruit to sites other than to their natal colony. Also, the instability of ice shelves and ice tongues means that emperor colonies located close to such features must periodically relocate [12], even if only a short distance. Therefore, the UK believes that it is important to consider all the breeding sites within a region. Over time, information about population redistribution and breeding site movement will accumulate.
The UK proposes that the breeding sites listed in Table 2 should be identified as candidate colonies for possible future area protection, and that other similar transects should be considered, particularly in the Ross Sea. As climate change proceeds, both the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea are likely to remain as refugia for ice dependent species such as emperor penguins. The UK envisages that monitoring in the Weddell Sea region should continue for a minimum of 10 years before recommendations about protection are made.  The UK has been accumulating data along these transects since 2009 and therefore intends to report upon progress in future years.  It is likely that only a small sub-set of the colonies identified in Table 2 would be proposed for local area protection.

Recommendations
The United Kingdom notes the priority given in ATME Recommendations and in the CEP Five Year Work Plan to addressing the implications of climate change. The UK believes that the techniques outlined in this paper could make a step-change contribution in improving the evidence base for the monitoring of vulnerable sites, including Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. 
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP:
    1. acknowledges the significant value offered by remote sensing as a technique for gathering detailed evidence on emperor penguin population variability, linked to localised climate change;
    2. endorses the proposal laid out in this paper as an appropriate method of identifying potential climate change refugia for emperor penguins; and
    3. encourages Parties with work programmes related to emperor penguins to consider collaboration with the UK in further developing and applying these monitoring techniques across the wider Antarctic region.
