Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Managed Area at Chinese Antarctic Kunlun Station, Dome A
1. Introduction
Chinese Antarctic Kunlun Station is located in Dome A area, its geographical position is at 80°25′01″S, 77°06′58″E. An area of approximately 19,764 km² encompassing the Station and long-term research and monitoring sites, locating in the hinterland of East Antarctica plateau and situating at the middle section of the ice divide of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, is the summit of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and considered to be of significant scientific, environmental and logistical values. 
There have huge resources of snow and ice in Dome A area which make it an ideal site for glaciological studies and the last candidate of the oldest ice core, for its slow ice flow and >3000 m ice thickness. The ongoing ice core is substantial for reconstructing the green gas history over the past million years and the refreezen processes under ice sheet. This area enjoys very good atmospheric transparency and seeing and continuous observation allowing for 3-4 months, and is supposed to be one of the best sites for observatory on earth. Katabatic wind prevails in this area, and descending air current from stratosphere and troposphere could directly deposit here, which makes it a best monitor on atmospheric environment background. Geophysical exploration and subglacial bedrock core drilling in Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains can be carried out with the logistical support of Kunlun Station which may uncover the mechanism of the craton here, validate the model of Antarctic continent tectonic and explore the history of Antarctic continental evolution. 
For the logistical value, Kunlun Station is an important junction point connecting Dome F, Vostok Station, Dome C, as well as Zhongshan Station, Davis Station and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and could act as an important logistics supporting site and provide key support for all kinds of scientific activities by China and other countries in Dome A area and the broader surrounding areas. 
Since 1996, CHINARE has been carrying out Zhongshan-Dome A inland traverse and conducting a comprehensive research and study (in particular, PANDA for the IPY and as a member of the AGAP program) in Dome A area including the construction of Kunlun Station. Furthermore, several international cooperation programs were implemented in this area. At present, CHINARE has finished the preparation for deep ice core drilling and the installation of astronomical observation equipment, meteorological station and seismic station from which a lot of data have been obtained.
It’s essential to have an advanced planning and management for Dome A area for a better protection of its scientific and environmental values, in order to make Kunlun Station play a key role in supporting scientific activities as an important international cooperation platform.
2. Values to be protected
The special values that have been identified at Chinese Antarctic Kunlun Station Dome A are as follows: 
    • The mean annual precipitation in Dome A area is about 6.5 cm (water equivalent); annual temperature is -58.4℃, the lowest temperature ever recorded is -82.5℃ (July 27, 2005), which make it become one of the areas with lowest surface temperature..
    • Dome A is considered to be an ideal site for glaciological studies and the last candidate of the oldest ice core, for its slow ice flow and >3000 m ice thickness. Dome A area is almost the centre of East Antarctica Ice Sheet, all moisture from South Atlantic Ocean, South Pacific Ocean and South Indian Ocean could arrive and precipitate here as “diamond dust”, so that the climatic and environmental in ice and snow represents the global background.
    • This area is extremely dry, with low amounts of atmospheric precipitable water vapor and low absorption of electromagnetic radiation in sub-millimeter wavelength range, so that it’s very suitable for the observation of radio wavelength band. 
    • Katabatic wind prevails in this area, and descending air current from stratosphere and troposphere could directly deposit here, which makes it a best monitor on atmospheric environment background. The information observed here could represent climatic or environmental changes at global scale.
    • Geophysical exploration and subglacial bedrock core drilling in Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains can be carried out with the logistical support of Kunlun Station which may uncover the mechanism of the craton here, validate the model of Antarctic continent tectonic and explore the history of Antarctic continental evolution.
    • Dome A area locates in the ionosphere projection area of the cusp region of the earth's magnetosphere, with the geomagnetic latitude of about 77.6°, which make it very suitable for the optical observation of dayside auroras.
    • The instauration of GPS CORS, GPS observation network and absolute gravity observation station, the observation and study of natural earthquake, and the medical research in Dome A area are likewise of sufficiently significant. 
    • The building of Kunlun Station can provide key support for further scientific research and all kinds of scientific activities by China and other countries in Dome A area and the broader surrounding areas.
3. Initial boundary proposal
The proposed boundary was developed through consultation and discussion with the scientists ever working in Dome A area.  Considering the abovementioned values (detailed in the initial management plan prepared by China) and the increasing interests in this area which will undoubtedly result in more and more human activities, the scientific community agreed unanimously that there do have a need to designate an ASMA for the protection its cherished values and define an appropriate boundary. The result of prudential consideration is some part of circles around Kunlun Station with a center point of the GPS station, which locates in front of the main building of Kunlun Station and the geographical position is at 80°25′01″S, 77°06′58″E, and radius of 120 km (for the Clean Air Sector) and 10 km (for the Buffer Zone) and 30 km (for the other two sectors of the Scientific Zone). The Operational Zone is a rectangular area and located between them. There have 5 zones and sectors in total. Please refer to the maps attached to this paper. 
4. Procedures so far and approach forward
Following a review of the scientific literature, consultation with a range of Chinese scientists who have carried out research and participated some international cooperation programs in Dome A area for many times, an initial draft management plan for Kunlun Station in Dome A area was drafted by China. Site assessments were undertaken by Chinese inland expeditions from 2010/11 to 2012/13 season. The initial draft management plan and maps were revised as a result of those site visits. 
In order to take this proposal forward, China suggests that the consultation process will focus on science community working in Dome A area, with the aim of developing appropriate boundaries and management provisions specific to this area, and conduct a site assessment during the 2013/14 field season, with the aim of reviewing boundary area and considering those provisions in line with comments on the initial draft management plan which are expected to be received during the intersessional period. 
China wishes to engage with a broader scientific community, especially those believing in the protected values of Dome A area, to ensure that appropriate management approaches are used in the protection of this area. 
5. Proposal
China proposes that the initial draft management plan for Kunlun Station Dome A is considered by the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) during the intersessional period between CEP XVI (2013) and CEP XVII (2014) to discuss protection mechanism for Dome A area and develop a final draft ASMA Management Plan based on the initial one attached to this paper to be submitted to the CEP in 2014.
