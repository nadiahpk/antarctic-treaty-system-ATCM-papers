Glossary of terms and expressions used by the ATCM
Introduction

The availability of the documents and information of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) in the four official languages provided for by Article XIV of the Antarctic Treaty, and the possibility for delegates to use these languages during the meetings were acknowledged in 1959 as a fundamental principle of ATCM operation. That principle is also embodied in Article 22 of the ATCM rules of procedure, which requires interpreting services to be provided in English, French, Russian and Spanish at the meetings in addition to translation into those languages of the official documents and texts adopted by the ATCM – final reports, measures, decisions and resolutions.

However, the growing size and number of texts submitted to the ATCM and adopted by the meeting every year compels the translation services to work on an urgent basis to translate the definitive texts of final reports, measures, decisions and resolutions during the night preceding the last day of the meeting.

In order to facilitate this translation work, to make it more precise within the deadlines and to harmonise the translation of the terms used by the ATCM, France proposes that the ATCM adopt a comprehensive glossary of its terminology in the four official languages. In this purpose, France proposes that an intersessional contact group be established to elaborate such a glossary in the four ATCM languages, based on the first French/English and English/French contribution attached to the present working paper under the title of French/English and English/French contribution for a Glossary of the ATCM Terminology (referred to hereinafter as the “first contribution to the proposed Glossary”).
Description of the attached first contribution to the proposed Glossary

The first contribution to the Glossary France proposes to elaborate is in two parts, the first containing translations from French into English and the second translations from English into French. Both parts contain a list of technical terms used by the ATCM, arranged in alphabetical order, followed by a list of titles of all the recommendations, measures, decisions, resolutions and other texts adopted by the ATCM since 1961, arranged by document type, date and reference.
Facilitating translation into the four languages

The proposal of an ATCM Glossary is not seen as a definitive solution to the difficulties entailed by the volume of documents to be translated, but simply as a means of facilitating this work by allowing the translators to avoid time-consuming researches on the technical terminology used by the ATCM. By listing the official terms and expressions in a single document, such a Glossary would remove the need for translators to refer to the website and/or previous ATCM documentation.

To that end, the intention is that this document should be “dynamic”, that is to say new terms or terms unintentionally omitted in previous versions could be added to it every year. France wishes the Secretariat, the translators and the delegations to appropriate this document and make suggestions on a regular basis as to terms to be added in the four ATCM languages. The Secretariat would then keep the Glossary up to date on a regular basis and make the most recent version available on its website to translators and the general public.
Harmonisation of ATCM terminology in the four languages

The constraints imposed on translation services have led, in some occasion, to the translation of terms and expression from English into French in more than one way from a document to another and/or from a year to another. The purpose of the ATCM Glossary France proposes to elaborate would help harmonise the terminologies employed in the four languages in order to ensure that texts adopted by the ATCM are consistent, avoiding confusion that may be prejudicial to their proper implementation.
These texts are indeed legally binding for the Parties engaged in activities in the Antarctic and for their nationals, and the legal system of several Parties require their publication in the official journals. For these reasons they must be as consistent as possible, since any error in translation or imprecision in terminology may have an impact on the proper implementation of these texts as well as on the legal certainty that has to be guaranteed to the citizens.
Recommendations

In light of the above, France proposes to the ATCM that the Resolution set out in Annex A be adopted, permitting the following:

    a) The creation of an intersessional contact group to draft a Glossary of terms and expressions used by the ATCM in the latter’s four official languages, based on the first contribution put forward by France at ATCM XXXVI;
    b) An invitation to the Consultative and Non-Consultative Parties, the Secretariat, the Observers and the Experts to put forward, to the extent they consider appropriate, additional entries for this document, both in the intersessional contact group and at subsequent ATCM;
    c) To entrust the French delegation, in conjunction with the Secretariat, with the task of centralising the contributions made by interested parties in the four languages, through the intersessional contact group, with a view to elaborate a draft Glossary to be submitted to ATCM XXXVII;
    d) A report by the French delegation to ATCM XXXVII on the results obtained during the intersessional period with a view to the adoption of the Glossary by ATCM XXXVII and in order to entrust the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with ensuring that the Glossary is available on line and updated regularly on the basis of contributions that may be provided by delegations.
Annex A

Resolution XX (2012), Glossary of terms and expressions used by the ATCM

The Representatives, 
Recalling that the four official languages of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting as provided by Article XIV of the Antarctic Treaty are English, French, Spanish and Russian;
Recalling that Measure 1 (2003) entrusted the Secretariat with ensuring the translation of meeting documents and providing interpretation services for the ATCM and the CEP;
Recalling the Guidelines for the Submission, Translation and Distribution of Documents for the ATCM and the CEP adopted by Decision 2 (2011) and notably the rule whereby “No paper submitted to the ATCM should be used as the basis for discussion at the ATCM or at the CEP unless it has been translated into the four official languages”;
Recalling the ATCM rules of procedure adopted by Decision 2 (2011);

Recommend that:
    1. An intersessional contact group be tasked to draft a Glossary of terms and expressions used by the ATCM in the four official languages basing its work on the first contribution proposed during ATCM XXXVI;
    2. The Consultative Parties, the Non-Consultative Parties, the Secretariat, the Observers and the Invited Experts be invited to propose, to the extent they consider appropriate, contributions for addition to the Glossary in the four official languages of the ATCM through the aforementioned intersessional contact group;
    3. The French delegation reports to ATCM XXXVII on the results of the intersessional contact group with a view to enabling the adoption of the Glossary by the ATCM and entrusting the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with ensuring that it is available on line and updated regularly.
