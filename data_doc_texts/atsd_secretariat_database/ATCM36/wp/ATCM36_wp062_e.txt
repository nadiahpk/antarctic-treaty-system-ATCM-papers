Upper “Summit Camp”, Mount Erebus

    i. Name of Proposed HSM: Terra Nova Expedition 1910-12, Camp Site used during survey of Mount Erebus in December 1912;

    ii. Description: Camp Site location includes part of a circle of rocks, which were likely used to weight the tent valences.  The camp site was used by a science party on Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition, who undertook mapping and collected geological specimens on Mount Erebus in December 1912;

    iii. Co-ordinates: 77⁰ 30.348’ S, 167⁰ 10.223’E (circa 3,410m above sea level);

    iv. Original proposing Party: United Kingdom, New Zealand and United States;

    v. Party undertaking management: United Kingdom, New Zealand and United States.


Lower “Camp E”, Mount Erebus

    i. Name of Proposed HSM: Terra Nova Expedition 1910-12, Camp Site used during survey of Mount Erebus in December 1912;

    ii. Description: Camp Site location consists of a slightly elevated area of gravel and includes some aligned rocks, which may have been used to weight the tent valences.  The camp site was used by a science party on Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition, who undertook mapping and collected geological specimens on Mount Erebus in December 1912;

    iii. Co-ordinates: 77⁰ 29.565’ S, 167⁰ 9.246’E (circa 2,716m above sea level);

    v. Party undertaking management: United Kingdom, New Zealand and United States.



Summary

    1. This paper proposes two new Historic Site and Monuments, in accordance with Article 8 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  The sites proposed are the locations of camp sites on Mount Erebus, used between 8th and 13th December 1912 by a team of scientists who were in Antarctica as part of Captain Scott’s Terra Nova expedition 1910-1912.  The sites were located in December 2012, using historical records and photographs, by a British geologist, who was part of a U.S. Antarctic Program science team studying the Mt. Erebus volcanic system.  Whilst the camp sites were heavily covered in snow at the time they were located, one included part of a circle of rocks, which were likely used to weight the tent valances, and the other included some aligned rocks, which may have also been so used.  No investigation or archaeological work was undertaken at either site, so information about the sites is limited.  However, the locations of the camps are of significant interest to Antarctic historians, and uncontrolled access to the sites, which might disturb any additional historic remains would be of concern.  The United Kingdom, New Zealand and United States are therefore of the view that these sites should be afforded protection under Annex V of the Protocol.

Background

    2. In December 1912 a small science party, who were part of the Terra Nova expedition 1910-1912, ascended Mount Erebus to undertake geological sampling and survey work.  The team was led by geologist Raymond Priestley, who had previously worked at Mt. Erebus as a geologist with Shackleton’s 1907-1909 Nimrod Expeditions, and included Norwegian ski specialist Tryggve Gran, Terra Nova steward Frederick Hooper, Able Seaman Harry Dickason RN, Petty Officer George Abbott RN and Australian geologist Frank Debenham. They undertook mapping and collected geological specimens. The climb is of particular historical significance in the United Kingdom, as it was during his time on Mount Erebus that Frank Debenham had the idea of a 'Polar Institute'. After serving in World War I, Debenham was the founding Director of the University of Cambridge's Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI).

    3. The camps on Mount Erebus were occupied between 8th and 13th December 1912.  From the historical records, it appears that the lower “Camp E” was used by the entire abovementioned party.  A further “Gully Camp” (as yet not located) was then established by Debenham and Dickason as their base for surveying the “Old Crater” (i.e. the Fang Ridge), while the others in the science party continued from there to the crater, and made camp at the upper “Summit Camp” en route, between 10th and 12th December 1912.  The summit party then rejoined their colleagues lower down the mountain on the afternoon of 12th December 1912 before descending.

Position and Description

Upper “Summit Camp”: Position: 77⁰ 30.348’ S, 167⁰ 10.223’E (circa 3,410m above sea level);

    4. In December 2012, this site was located enclosed by two ridges of lava at the caldera rim and identified as including a semi-circle of rocks embedded in the snow, in the approximate location of the tent used by the science party in December 2012.  The photographs below show the site as taken by the December 1912 scientific party on the left, and on the right is the location as identified in December 2012.

Lower “Camp E”: Position: 77⁰ 29.565’ S, 167⁰ 9.246’E (circa 2,716m above sea level).

    5. Today this site consists of a slightly elevated area of gravel.  When it was identified in December 2012, there appeared to be some aligned rocks that may have been used to anchor tent valences. The photographs below show the site as taken by the December 1912 scientific party on the left, and on the right is the location as identified in December 2012.

    6. The camp site locations are also shown on the annexed map (with many thanks to the US National Science Foundation).

Reason for Designation

    7. In conclusion, and with reference to Resolution 8(1995) and the Annex to Resolution 3(2009), these sites merit Historic Site and Monument listing because:

    a. Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition 1910-12 was one of the most significant early pioneering expeditions to Antarctica;
    b. The scientific activities of the Terra Nova Expedition continue to provide important reference and baseline information for scientists today;
    c. The Mount Erebus mapping and geological work in December 1912 provided new and significant information at that time; 
    d. The climb was of particular historical significance, as it was during his time on Mount Erebus that Frank Debenham had the idea of establishing the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI), as a legacy to Captain Scott; and
    e. The proposed HSM’s have the potential to reveal additional historical and scientific information.
