Subsidiary Group on Management Plans – Report on 2012/13 Intersessional Work
Working Paper submitted by Norway on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
During the 2012/13 intersessional period the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP), in accordance with its Terms of Reference #1 to #3, reviewed eight draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) management plan referred by the Committee for intersessional review. 
The SGMP recommends that the Committee approves the attached three revised management plans:
    • ASPA No. 132: Potter Peninsula (Argentina)
    • ASPA No. 151: Lions Rump, King George Island, South Shetland Islands (Poland)
    • New ASPA: Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay, Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea (USA/Italy)
Furthermore, the SGMP advises the CEP that further intersessional work will be conducted with regards to five management plans submitted for intersessional review:
    • ASPA 128: Western Shores of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands (Poland/USA)
    • ASPA No. 144: ‘Chile Bay’ (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 145: Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile)
    • ASPA No. 146: South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago (Chile)
    • New ASPA: High altitude geothermal sites of the Ross Sea region (New Zealand)

The SGMP had no tasks relating to its Terms of Reference #4 and #5 during the intersessional period. 
    1. Background
During the 2012/13 intersessional period the SGMP operated in accordance with the work plan agreed by CEP XV (Final Report, para. 111), and the Terms of Reference adopted by CEP XIII (Final Report, Appendix 1):
    1) Examine any draft new or revised Management Plan to consider, in consultation with relevant experts if appropriate:
    • whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol, particularly Articles 3, 4 and 5, and with relevant CEP guidelines;
    • its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness;
    • whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation; and
    • whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole.
    2) Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.
    3) Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management Plan, identifying where the Plan reflects comments received by Members, and where they have not been, the reasons for not doing so. The Working Paper is to include all revised Management Plans and the information required by the ATCM’s Legal and Institutional Working Group.
    4) Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review.
    5) Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent and likely to be effective.
The SGMP was convened by the CEP second Vice-Chair, Birgit Njåstad from Norway. Representatives from Argentina, ASOC, Australia, Chile, IAATO, India, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, SCAR, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States were registered to participate within the SGMP framework, noting however that all plans are available for comment from any CEP member during the SGMP process. Discussions took place by correspondence, using the CEP Discussion Forum and email.
    2. Review of the revised draft management plans 

ASPA 132 Potter Peninsula
At CEP XV Argentina submitted WP 44 Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 132 Potter Peninsula. The CEP recommended referring the plan for intersessional review (para. 89 of the CEP XV Final Report).  No specific observations with respect to this draft management plan were recorded in the CEP XV Final Report. The SGMP’s review of the management plan was coordinated by SGMP member from Australia.
On 1 August 2012, the SGMP convener issued an invitation to all CEP contact points to submit comments on the draft management plan. 
In October 2012 the SGMP provided its initial advice to the proponent, recommending some modifications to the draft revised management plan submitted to CEP XV in ATCM XXXV/WP44. The SGMP’s full advice is available on the Discussion Forum. In particular, the group suggested that the proponent provide further details and clarification regarding:
    • the values to be protected, in particular the flora;
    • the provisions for activities within the Area; and  
    • improvements of maps.
The SGMP advised that, with these and other minor modifications, the plan would adequately address the provisions of Annex V and relevant CEP guidelines, and was likely to be effective in achieving the stated aims and objectives for management of the Area. 
In January/February 2013 Argentina provided an updated draft management plan and a separate document explaining its responses to the SGMP’s advice. The SGMP concluded that the updated draft management plan was well written, of high quality, and adequately addressed the key points raised in its earlier advice. Argentina made further changes to the text and maps to address minor outstanding issues.

The resulting final revised draft management plan is presented in Attachment A to this Working Paper. Introductory comments and a coversheet prepared by the proponent are presented at Appendix 1.

Appendix 2. Introductory comments by Poland 
Draft Revised Management Plan for
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 151 Lions Rump, King George Island, South Shetland Islands
    4. The primary reason for the designation of Lions Rump (62º08’S; 58º07’W), King George Island, South Shetland Islands, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) is to protect its ecological values, as it contains diverse biota and geological features and is a representative example of the terrestrial, limnological, and littoral habitats of the maritime Antarctic. Lions Rump is also valuable as a reference site with diverse avian and mammalian Antarctic fauna, against which disturbance at sites situated near sites of human activity can be measured.
    5. The Area was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 34 through Recommendation XVI-2 (1991, SSSI No. 34). In accordance with Decision 1 (2002), the Area was re-designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA No. 151). A revised Management Plan was adopted through Measure 1 (2000).
    6. Minor changes have been made to the provisions of the existing Management Plan, which include:
    i. Introduction.

Appendix 3. Introductory comments by USA and Italy 

Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at 
Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay,
Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea
    1. Italy and the United States have identified a part of northern Terra Nova Bay that meets criteria for designation as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area under Annex V to the Protocol, which seeks to include within the protected area system “…areas with important or unusual assemblages of species, including major colonies of breeding native birds or mammals…” and “…areas of particular interest to on-going or planned scientific research”.
    2. Following a review of the scientific literature, consultation with a range of scientists who have carried out research in the area for many years, and after discussions amongst national programs operating in the local region, a proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area and draft Management Plan and maps for Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay were presented by Italy and the United States in  in XXXV ATCM WP40 Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea held in Hobart in 2012.
    3. The proposal was referred to the CEP Sub- Group on Management Plans (SGMP) for detailed consideration over 2012-13. In addition, in view of the fact that ~98 % of the Area proposed was marine, the proposal was forwarded to the Chair of the Commission of CCAMLR for consideration by the appropriate scientific and technical bodies.
    4. The proposal was considered by CCAMLR XXXI in 2012, and the Commission endorsed the advice of the Scientific Committee (SC-CAMLR-XXXI, Paragraphs 5.60 to 5.73) in respect of the draft management plan for a new ASPA at Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay.  The Commission agreed that no issues with respect to CCAMLR had been identified in the proposal, and that this advice should be communicated to the ATCM.
    5. The rationale for the proposed Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay ASPA was explained XXXV ATCM WP40 Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, and this rationale remains unchanged. For the convenience of delegates, this rationale is repeated in summarised form in Paragraphs 6 and 7 below. The full rationale is provided in Section 1 of the proposed Management Plan, the ‘Description of Values to be Protected’.
    6. The proposed Cape Washington and Silverfish Bay ASPA is situated in the northern part of Terra Nova Bay between Campbell Glacier Tongue and Cape Washington (see Map 1 annexed to the draft plan). One of the largest emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies in Antarctica is located at Cape Washington, and a rich Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) ‘nursery’ has been identified in the eastern embayment adjacent to the Campbell Glacier Tongue, accordingly named Silverfish Bay. More recent observations have shown large numbers of Pleuragramma eggs under sea-ice between Cape Washington and Oscar Point. A range of marine mammals are regularly observed in this area (e.g. killer whales (Orcinus orca) Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx) seals). A south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) colony is located on Cape Washington, and snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) breed in the Cape Washington cliffs. The region is of high scientific interest, with a long time-series of data for the Cape Washington emperor colony in particular.
    7. The site has exceptional value for scientific observations of the interactions and predator / prey relationships between many different members of the marine ecosystem within a relatively compact area that is accessible to scientists supported by nearby research stations. The boundaries were defined to ensure that all components of the local ecosystem were included within the ASPA. The boundary includes the breeding area of the emperor colony, which shifts throughout the season over an area up to six kilometres principally to the west and north of Cape Washington. The proposed boundary includes Silverfish Bay, where elevated concentrations of Silverfish eggs and larvae have been observed. 
    8. Following comments made at the XXXV ATCM and subsequently received from the SGMP, the proposed boundaries have been adjusted slightly in the current proposal. The eastern boundary has been extended one kilometer eastward from the original proposal, to the 165° 27' E line of longitude. This change followed scientific advice that this area represents an important ‘pathway’ used by emperor penguins for access to the sea and is also an important area of predator / prey interaction that should be included within the ASPA.
    9. Also following comments, careful consideration has been given to the appropriateness of the boundaries more generally, and the size of the Area. In particular, it was recognized that the emperor colony has attracted interest for tourism and also from local station personnel for recreational visits for a number of years. The comments made by IAATO, representing the views of the commercial tour industry, have been given particular consideration. As a result, a range of options to re-configure and / or reduce the size of the Area, including to design boundaries so that a ‘corridor’ might extend into the colony breeding area (that would offer access without the need for a permit) were considered. The proponents concluded that these options would be insufficient to encompass and protect the values of the Area, and would result in an undesirable compromise to the ASPA. In addition, the option to allow tourist and station personnel entry into the Area by permit, similar to current practice at a number of ASPAs protecting historic values, was considered inappropriate at an ASPA designed to protect the ecological and scientific values, and was therefore rejected.
    10. The southern boundary proposed in the original submission, i.e. line of latitude at 74° 40' S, which lies 2.1 km south from Cape Washington, has not been changed. The proponents remain of the view that this boundary is appropriate to provide sufficient protection of the values of the Area. It is recognized that this will reduce opportunities for tourists and station personnel to make close-range observations of breeding activities at the Cape Washington colony, although on balance the proponents consider that providing robust protection of the outstanding natural and scientific values of the emperor colony and associated marine ecosystem, including a nursery area for the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), should take precedence. This approach is consistent with the requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, in particular with Articles 3.1 and 3.3 regarding Environmental Principles, and with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of Annex V to the Protocol.
    11. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 9 and 10 above and taking into consideration views expressed on access, the proponents have followed scientific advice that the region extending several kilometers south of the southern boundary is typically frequented by emperor penguins when sea ice is present, which – although not typically the preferred location for breeding and creching by the birds – is likely to provide rewarding viewing opportunities for visitors from outside of the ASPA boundary. In addition, the proponents observe that there remain alternative emperor colonies in the Ross Sea and elsewhere in Antarctica that are available for more close-range viewing opportunities.
    12. Following the original proposal, further consideration has been given to air and ship access. The current proposal has therefore included a ‘Restricted Zone’ to manage such access more explicitly and effectively. More explicit and precise guidance for aircraft access to Cape Washington itself has also been included. The boundaries of the Restricted Zone and the Area more generally do not conflict with the operational needs of aircraft and ships providing support to nearby research stations (Mario Zucchelli (Italy), Gondwana (Germany), and Jang Bogo (under construction by the Republic of Korea)).
    13. The draft Management Plan is attached for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection for recommendation for adoption by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
