Review of ATCM Recommendations on Operational Matters
Introduction
At ATCM XXXV, the Antarctic Treaty Executive Secretary presented SP 9, Report of the Intersessional Contact Group on the Review of ATCM Recommendations on Operational Matters, which continued the analysis of operational recommendations as agreed by ATCM XXXIV. The ICG had reviewed twenty-eight recommendations in four categories.
The ICG identified eleven recommendations that are current; seven recommendations that are no longer current; twelve recommendations containing current general principles but outdated operational paragraphs requiring updating; and eight technical recommendations relating to meteorology, on which advice was required from relevant expert bodies, including WMO, COMNAP and SCAR.
COMNAP offered to provide draft language for those recommendations identified by the ICG as requiring updating, and also to suggest draft report language for the ATCMXXXVI final report, in those cases where the general principles of the recommendations might still be valid, but the technical and practical aspects may be outdated and therefore no longer current.
Given the subject matter contained in the recommendations that require updating, COMNAP agreed it would invite other organisations with expertise on particular technical topics, such as the WMO, IAATO and the IHO in particular, to contribute to the drafting work. ATCM XXXV accepted the offer by COMNAP and this Working Paper is presented as a result.
Procedure
COMNAP invited representatives from IAATO, IHO, SCAR and WMO to participate in the project to update the twelve recommendations under the categories: logistics, siting of stations, aircraft, hydrography, fuel storage and handling, contingency planning, shipping regulations, and telecommunications; and the eight technical recommendations relating to meteorology. Each organization agreed to participate.
Given the various topics that were the subject of the recommendations, each organization took the lead on certain recommendations and the subsequent drafting of draft report language or updated recommendations. The chart below shows what was considered and by which organisation in particular, although all organizations involved were given an opportunity to comment on all the entire suggested draft language and final draft Working Paper.

C. 

Eight Recommendations relating to meteorology

15
Rec. V-2 (1968)
Cooperation on Antarctic Meteorology
Further consideration required
WMO
16
Rec. VI-1 (1970)
Guideline recommendations on Antarctic telecommunications
Further consideration required
WMO
17
Rec. VI-3 (1970)
Exchange of meteorological information
Further consideration required
WMO

Rec. X-3 (1979)
Antarctic meteorological data; telecommunications handbook
Further consideration required
COMNAP & WMO
19
Rec. XII-1 (1983)

*Note: This is the same recommendation. Points 1-5 and 8-10 are related to meteorology, while points 6 and 7 refer to the telecommunications manual.  Therefore this recommendation was considered by WMO and COMNAP and suggestions can therefore be found in both Attachments A and C.






Results for ATCM consideration
The suggestions are presented in three attachments.  Attachment A contains the suggestions for the twelve recommendations which required updating; Attachment B contains the suggestions for the two recommendations which required further advice from COMNAP and SCAR; and Attachment C contains the suggestions for the eight recommendations related to meteorology from WMO.
Within each attachment, the format is as follows: First, the original recommendation, decision or resolution is shown.  Then, there is a suggestion either for final report language or for an updated recommendation, decision or resolution.  Such updates are usually presented in “track changes” mode so that it can clearly be seen where changes are being suggested and what those changes are.
 Recommendation
We invite the ATCM to consider the suggestions for updates contained in Attachments A, B and C and act upon those suggestions in whatever way ATCM deems appropriate.
