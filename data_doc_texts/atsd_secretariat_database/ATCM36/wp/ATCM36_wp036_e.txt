Review of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 135, 143 and 160
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
Australia has conducted a five-yearly review of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula, ASPA 143 Marine Plain, and ASPA 160 Frazier Islands, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. Australia recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plans for these ASPAs.
Introduction	
In accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia has conducted a five-yearly review of the Management Plans for:
    • ASPA 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land;
    • ASPA 143 Marine Plain, Mule Peninsula, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land; and
    • ASPA 160 Frazier Islands, Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica.
The reviews were conducted with reference to Annex V and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide) appended to Resolution 2 (2011). The following sections briefly introduce each Area, and describe the proposed amendments arising from the review of each Management Plan.
ASPA 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula
The North-East Bailey Peninsula ASPA (66°16’59.9"S, 110°31’59.9"E) is located approximately 200m east of Australia’s Casey station, in the Windmill Islands region of the Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. It was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No 16 under Recommendation XIII-9 (1985), and redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 135 under Decision 1 (2002). Revised Management Plans for the ASPA were adopted under Measure 2 (2003) and Measure 8 (2008). The ASPA is designated primarily as a scientific reference site which, since the early 1980s, has supported a range of studies into the diverse assemblage of vegetation found in the area. The close proximity of the Area to Casey station allows ease of access for field research but also creates the potential for disturbance of study areas. The ASPA is designated for an indefinite period. A revised Management Plan for ASPA 135 is provided at Attachment A.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 135
    • There are no changes to the Area boundary.
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) and Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • Management provisions in sections 7(i), 7(iii), 7(iv) and 7(xi) have been updated for consistency with suggested standard wording presented in the Guide.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 8 has been updated to include recent publications.
    • Improved maps have been incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the Guide. 
ASPA 143 Marine Plain
The Marine Plain ASPA is located on and adjacent to Mule Peninsula in the Vestfold Hills, approximately 10 km south-east of Australia’s Davis station. It was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest No 25 under Recommendation XIV-5 (1987), and was redesignated and renumbered as ASPA 143 under Decision 1(2002). A revised Management Plan for the Area was adopted under Measure 2 (2003), and reviewed and retained without changes at CEP XI (2008). The Area contains outstanding vertebrate fossil fauna and rare geological features and is of exceptional ongoing scientific interest. Burton Lake, within the Area, represents a unique stage in the biological and physico-chemical evolution of a terrestrial water body from the marine environment. The ASPA is designated for an indefinite period. A revised Management Plan for ASPA 143 is provided at Attachment B.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 143
    • There are no changes to the boundary of the Area.
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A statement of the primary reason for designation has been added to the Introduction.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) and Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • A reference to Hawker Island ASPA 167 has been added to Section 6(iv).
    • Management provisions in sections 7(i), 7(iv), 7(vi), 7(vii) and 7(xi) have been updated for consistency with suggested standard wording presented in the Guide.
    • Improved maps have been incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the Guide. 
ASPA 160 Frazier Islands
The Frazier Islands ASPA comprises three small islands (Nelly, Dewart and Charlton) with a combined total area of approximately 0.6 km². The islands lie in the eastern part of Vincennes Bay approximately 16 km to the west-north-west of Australia’s Casey station. The ASPA was designated under Measure 2 (2003), and a revised management plan was adopted under Measure 13 (2008). The islands are one of only four known breeding localities of southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus around the coastline of continental Antarctica, are the only breeding site in nearly 3000 km of coastline between Davis station and Dumont d’Urville, and provide a reference area for future comparative studies with other breeding populations of Southern Giant Petrels. The ASPA is designated for an indefinite period. A revised Management Plan for ASPA 160 is provided at Attachment C.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASPA 160
    • There are no changes to the boundary of the Area.
    • There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures.
    • A statement of the primary reason for designation has been added to the Introduction.
    • The estimate of the population of southern giant petrels has been updated in Section 1 and Appendix 1 to reflect the most recent count in 2011 (237 breeding pairs).
    • The management activities in Section 3 have been updated to encourage minimal impact approaches to monitoring the status of the values of the area, in particular the southern giant petrels.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) and Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to Section 6(i).
    • The temporary installation of automatic cameras on Nelly Island, to establish the breeding chronology and success of southern giant petrels, has been noted in Sections 1, 6(i) and 6(iii).
    • A reference to Hawker Island ASPA 167 has been added to Section 6(iv).
    • Section 7(ii) has been updated to clarify the provisions for the use of aircraft in the vicinity of the Area.
    • Management provisions in sections 7(i), 7(iv), 7(vi), 7(vii) and 7(xi) have been updated for consistency with suggested standard wording presented in the Guide.
    • The list of supporting documentation in Section 8 has been updated to include recent publications.
    • Improved maps have been incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the Guide.
