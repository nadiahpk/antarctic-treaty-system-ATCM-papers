Draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plan for Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land









Draft Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plan for Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land
Joint Working Paper submitted to the Committee for Environmental Protection 
by Australia, China, India and Russian Federation
    1. Introduction
Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation jointly propose the designation of Stornes, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) under Article 3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Larsemann Hills Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) Management Plan (section 5.4) currently designates the area as a Restricted Zone, and notes that consideration would be given to the possible designation of Stornes as an ASPA.  
The draft ASPA Management Plan aims to protect the geological features that are unique to Antarctica, specifically the rare mineral occurrences and the highly unusual host rocks in which they occur. This objective is consistent with Article 3.2(f) of Annex V, which provides for ‘examples of outstanding geological, glaciological or geomorphological features’ to be included in the series of ASPAs. 

The designation of Stornes as an ASPA would also ensure protection of this infrequently visited and consequently minimally impacted peninsula, including as a reference site for possible future comparison with other parts of the Larsemann Hills where several research stations are located.
    2. Management Plan format
The Management Plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, appended to Resolution 2 (2011).
    3. Recommendation
The draft Management Plan is submitted for consideration by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP). Consistent with the Guidelines for CEP Consideration of New and Revised Draft Management ASPA and ASMA Management Plans, Australia, China, India and the Russian Federation recommend that the CEP, as appropriate, refer the draft Management Plan to ATCM XXXVI for adoption or to the Subsidiary Group on Management Plan for intersessional review.
