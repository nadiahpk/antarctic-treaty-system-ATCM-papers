An Antarctic Clean-Up Manual: report of informal intersessional discussion
Working Paper submitted by Australia and the United Kingdom
Summary
At CEP XV the Committee discussed Working Paper 21 An Antarctic Clean-Up Manual, presented by Australia and the United Kingdom, and agreed to continue to develop the draft Clean-Up Manual through informal intersessional discussion. Several Members and one Observer contributed suggestions during the intersessional period, and these have been incorporated into a revised Clean-Up Manual for consideration by the Committee. Australia and the United Kingdom recommend that the CEP endorses the revised manual, encourages Members and Observers to develop practical guidelines and supporting resources for inclusion in the manual, and forwards the attached draft Resolution and manual to the ATCM for approval.
Background
At CEP XV (2012) Australia and the United Kingdom presented Working Paper 21 An Antarctic Clean-Up Manual, which proposed the development of a Clean-Up Manual as a central source of practical guidance to assist Parties to address their obligations under Annex III to the Environmental Protocol. The Committee supported the proposal and decided to continue to develop the draft manual attached to Working Paper 21, through an informal intersessional discussion led by Australia and the United Kingdom, with a view to producing an updated document for consideration at CEP XVI.
Informal intersessional discussion
The informal intersessional discussion was conducted via the CEP Discussion Forum. In September 2012, Australia and the United Kingdom wrote to all CEP Members and Observers to invite suggestions for improving the draft Clean-Up Manual attached to Working Paper 21. Australia and the United Kingdom considered comments received, and circulated two revisions of the draft manual for comment, in December 2012 and February 2013.
Comments were provided by Argentina, France, Japan, Germany, Norway, United States, Uruguay and ASOC, and included suggestions to: 
    • rearrange the order of information presented in the Introduction section;
    • broaden the scope of the objective to also include the clean-up of other hazardous substances (i.e. in addition to fuel spills);
    • mention the provisions of Resolution 5 (2001) Guidelines for Handling of Pre-1958 Historic Remains Whose Existence or Present Location is not Known;
    • recognise possible risks to human safety as a reason to undertake clean-up actions, and emphasise the importance of ensuring the safety of personnel in the planning and conduct of clean-up activities; and
    • note that the site assessment stage of the clean-up process should also consider potential practical challenges for clean-up actions (e.g. ease of access for machinery).
Participants in the informal discussion also emphasised that, similar to the CEP Non-Native Species Manual, it would be beneficial to further develop the Clean-Up Manual over time to incorporate practical guidelines and supporting resources developed by Members and Observers. Several examples of such materials were identified, including:
    • a standard approach and/or form for record keeping and reporting on clean-up activities;
    • checklists and/or matrices for site assessment and environmental risk assessment;
    • scientific information to inform the setting of appropriate environmental quality targets;
    • techniques for preventing mobilisation of contaminants such as melt water diversion and containment barriers;
    • techniques for in situ remediation of sites and clean-up ex situ of material contaminated by fuel or other hazardous substances;
    • techniques for the clean-up of buildings or other structures at abandoned work sites;
    • guidance for planning and undertaking monitoring and evaluation.
Revised draft Clean-Up Manual
Australia and the United Kingdom are grateful for the valuable suggestions put forward by Members and Observers, and have made best efforts to address all comments in the revised draft Clean-Up Manual annexed to the draft Resolution presented at Attachment A. 
Recommendations
Australia and the United Kingdom recommend that the CEP:
    1) considers and endorses the Clean-Up Manual annexed to the draft Resolution presented at Attachment A; 
    2) encourages Members and Observers to develop practical guidelines and supporting resources for inclusion in the manual in the future; and
    3) agrees to convey the attached draft Resolution and annexed Clean-Up Manual to the ATCM for approval.

Attachment A
Draft Resolution XX
Antarctic Clean-Up Manual

The Representatives,

Reaffirming the commitment of Parties to the Environmental Protocol to reduce as far as practicable the amount of wastes produced or disposed of in the Antarctic Treaty area, so as to minimise impact on the Antarctic environment and to minimise interference with the natural values of Antarctica, with scientific research and with other uses of Antarctica which are consistent with the Antarctic Treaty;
Recalling the requirement under Article 1.5 of Annex III to the Environmental Protocol that past and present waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities shall be cleaned up by the generator of such wastes and the user of such sites, provided that such actions shall not require the removal of any structure designated as a historic site or monument, or the removal of any structure or waste material in circumstances where the removal by any practical option would result in greater adverse environmental impact than leaving the structure or waste material in its existing location;
Recalling also the 2010 Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Implications of Climate Change for Antarctic Management and Governance, which noted that climate changes create the potential for localised release of contamination from past waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites through increased melting;
Noting the actions taken by Parties since the entry into force of the Environmental Protocol to effectively handle waste and to clean up past waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites;
Noting also the efforts of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs to develop and formulate best practice procedures for waste management, including through the workshop on Waste Management in Antarctica held in Hobart in 2006;
Welcoming the development by the Committee for Environmental Protection of a Clean-Up Manual that Parties can apply and use, as appropriate, to assist with meeting their obligations under Article 1.5 of Annex III to the Environmental Protocol; 

Recommend that Parties:
    1) disseminate and encourage the use of the Clean-Up Manual annexed to this Resolution, as appropriate, to assist with addressing their obligations under Article 1.5 of Annex III to the Environmental Protocol; and
    2) encourage the Committee for Environmental Protection to continue to develop the Clean-Up Manual with the input of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs on scientific and practical matters, respectively.
