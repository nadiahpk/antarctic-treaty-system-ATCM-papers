SAR-WG: Proposed Development of 
Regional SAR Standard Operating Procedures 
Summary
Search and Rescue (SAR) standard operating procedures already exist in various types of documentation held by the five rescue coordination centers (RCCs) with Antarctic SAR responsibilities, the Antarctic tourism industry and private operators, in accordance with Measure 4 (2004), and also the stations operated by National Antarctic Programs (NAPs).  The intent of this paper is to encourage discussion at the ATCM XXXVI Special Working Group on SAR about what types of procedures are already maintained and then decide if there is a need to develop some common, basic SAR information and procedures which would be used by all RCCs, NAP stations and private operators/expeditions.  This type of documentation could be a convenient guide for new personnel or operators or for particularly complicated or rare events.  Each SAR event in Antarctica is naturally unique.  However, common procedures could be of particular use as many SAR events involve multiple actors and multiple parties.  

Background

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be called different names and can be made up of a collection of a variety of documents such as:
    • Standard operating procedures (SOPs) 
    • Checklists 
    • Plans of operation (discussed in the International Aeronautical and Maritime SAR (IAMSAR) Manual published by IMO and ICAO) 
    • Best practices 
    • Action Card (example from IAMSAR Manual, Volume III is at the end of this paper) 

SAR, as a contingency, has procedures and terminology which sound foreign to those who do not practice in this field.  The SAR services use standard procedures and checklists to reduce confusion and to streamline processes and procedures.  RCCs have requirements under various international SAR Conventions, as well as extensive guidance information found in the International Aeronautical and Maritime SAR (IAMSAR) Manual and other publications.  The International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization have requirements for RCCs to have readily available information within their SAR region and with adjacent SAR regions.  Such information includes: 
    • Addresses and telephone numbers of all operators, or their designated representatives, engaged in operations in the region 
    • Any other public and private resources including medical and transportation facilities that are likely to be useful in SAR
    • Locations and hours of watch of services keeping radio watch and the frequencies guarded
    • Locations where supplies of droppable emergency and survival equipment are stored 
    • Ready access to information regarding ships and SAR aircraft within the region 
    • Arrangements for refuelling, medical assistance, etc. 
    • Exercises

Naturally, NAP stations, private operators and individual expeditions have other contingency plans in place for their particular activities.  NAPs have developed their own SAR procedures and contingency plans over the years, taking into account their domestic procedures as well as those of relevant RCCs. 

The number of non-governmental visitors, expeditions and operators in Antarctica, all of whom also have their own SAR procedures and contingency plans, is again increasing each year and is expected to continue to grow.  As the number of operators and procedures grow, the value of ensuring that all activities share common practices also grows.

Thus, if we view the entire Antarctic Treaty area as one SAR system, that involves RCCs, NAPs, and private entities participating as integral components, questions come to mind for improving SAR coordination and cooperation, such as: 
    • Does that RCC have the same procedures in place with ALL of the NAP stations within that SAR region?  And do NAP Stations which are adjacent but in different SAR regions have common arrangements with each RCC? 
    • When a new NAP station is established, do the adjacent stations and the RCC provide a “Welcome Aboard” pack with local contingency and SAR procedures? 
    • How do RCCs engage with private operators in their RCC area?
    • How does industry engage RCCs across Antarctica?
    • How is information shared among involved parties?
    • How do RCCs, NAPs, and private entities respond to private inquiries about SAR incidents? Do the procedures also cover when the call may come from a family, foreign embassy or political friend of the adventurer?
Note: The term “arrangements” in the above paragraph is used by some countries to mean the same as an agreement, or memorandum of understanding or some other type of legal document; however, the intent of the above paragraph is to ensure that there is a mutually accepted process in place and this may or may not need a formal document. 

The goal of standard operating procedures is to provide the procedures and information needed for efficient and effective response to a SAR situation.  It does not have to be large and complicated but it needs to be easy for an inexperienced person to coordinate with an RCC, a NAP station, or a private expedition. And, they need to be understood by those from whom you seek assistance.  Some of the topics to cover include:  

    • Search planning forms (such as initial data to collect, types of search pattern, etc.)
    • Understanding specialized terminology (glossary and acronyms)
    • List of personnel with language skills (for verbal or written communication with other stations and RCCs)
    • Search action plan – understanding the message from the RCC which tells how to conduct the search (coordinates, type of craft, type of search, times to begin, information to report, etc…) 
    • Risk management considerations

The IAMSAR Manual provides guidance on many types of procedures and documents.  The attachment to this paper has an “action card” from the IAMSAR Manual, Volume III.  The term ‘action card’ may not be widely used at this time but has been accepted for use by IMO and ICAO.  It is similar to a checklist for actions to take, and it can serve as a reminder as to what a person needs to know and procedures to have in place.  Other action cards, checklists or procedures could be specific to types of operational response and provide guidance on matters such as risk assessment, conditions for not getting underway, etc.

Way forward

The harshness and remoteness of the Antarctic environment make it all the more important to have common understanding and procedures in place before a SAR or emergency incident.  Similar standard operating procedures between RCCs, RCCs and NAP stations, and with private operators could greatly facilitate future SAR activities. 

Recommendation

The United States proposes the attached Action Card be a beginning point for ATCM discussion on understanding common terminology and procedures as well as the need for such documentation.  All Consultative Parties, particularly those with SAR responsibilities in Antarctica, likely have similar types of operating procedures which, if shared, could benefit the entire Antarctic Treaty area.
