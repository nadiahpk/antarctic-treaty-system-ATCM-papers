Additional availability of information on lists of Observers of the Consultative Parties through the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat
Background
In order to promote the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty and ensure compliance with its provisions, the Parties have made a commitment to keep each other informed about their activities in Antarctica and facilitate inspections of their facilities by other Parties. Both topics are dealt with in article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and article XIV of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
The names of the appointed observers are communicated to each of the other Contracting Parties, through diplomatic channels. To date, the listing of these appointments have not been brought to the attention of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) and are consequently not included in their databases.
It should be noted that, according to Article 2 of Measure 1 (2003) - XXVI ATCM - CEP VI, Madrid, the ATS has, amongst others, the following functions:
    • (C) Facilitate and coordinate communication and exchange of information amongst Parties on all exchanges required under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;
    • (E) Establish, maintain, develop and, as appropriate, publish databases relevant to the operation of the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;
    • (F) Circulate amongst the parties any other relevant information and disseminate information on the activities in Antarctica;
    • (H) Facilitate the availability of information about the Antarctic Treaty System;
    • (L) Perform such other functions relevant to the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty as may be determined by the ATCM.
Bearing the above in mind, the ATS can also be considered to constitute a complementary source of information for the Parties on the appointment of observers. This information could be made available with restricted access, in the ATS Contacts Database, to be consulted by the Parties concerned. 
In view of the above, the following Decision proposal is submitted for consideration of the ATCM:






Decision X (2013)
Additional availability of information on lists of Observers of the Consultative Parties through the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty 
The Representatives,
Welcoming the proposal to use to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) in the framework of its functions, as a complementary information tool for the Parties, in this case the Observers appointed by them; 
Bearing in mind that since the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty and the creation of the ATS, new ways of transmitting information have been developed, and it is very useful to have a database of the appointed observers on the ATS website, available for consultation;
Considering that dissemination of information through the Secretariat is defined as a function of the Secretariat; 
Recognising that the delivery of this information to the ATS is complementary to notification to the Parties through diplomatic channels;
Recalling the provisions of article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and 14 of the Madrid Protocol, as well as article 2 of Measure 1 (2003) XXVI ATCM - CEP VI, Madrid, Spain;  

Decide:
    1) That the Consultative Parties are to inform the ATS, in addition to notification through diplomatic channels, of the assignment of Observers to carry out Inspections in the following session.
    2) That the ATS is to include this information with restricted access in its Contacts database,  and make it available to the Parties.
