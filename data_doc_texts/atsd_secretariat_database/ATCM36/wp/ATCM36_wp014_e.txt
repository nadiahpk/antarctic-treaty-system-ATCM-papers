Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 170 Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula








Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 170, Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA) 170 Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan.
Background
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA 170 Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula, in accordance with the Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The review was conducted with reference to Annex V and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011). 
ASPA 170 Marion Nunataks (69o45’S, 75o15’W) is located in the northwest corner of Charcot Island, to the west of Alexander Island, Antarctic Peninsula. The Area was designated as ASPA 170 under Measure 4 (2008), following a proposal by the United Kingdom, primarily to protect environmental values, and in particular, the terrestrial flora and fauna within the Area.  The terrestrial fauna is unique for the maritime Antarctic in that it appears to contain neither predatory arthropods nor Collembola (springtails), which are otherwise ubiquitous and important members of the terrestrial fauna of the zone.  
Summary of amendments
A revised Management Plan for ASPA 170 is provided at Attachment A. The amendments are summarised as follows:
    • An introduction has been added, including a statement of the primary reason for designation.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to the introduction.
    • A reference to the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to the introduction.
    • The Area boundary has been redefined to clarify the extent of the area under protection (Section 6i).  The new boundary description makes almost no difference to the area of land under protection, but removes ambiguity about the protected status of the marine area to the north and west of Marion Nunataks.
    • A requirement that visitors take precautions against the introduction of non-native organisms to the Area, and guidance on appropriate precautions, has been strengthened with advice for visitors arriving by small boat having been added to Section 7(x). 
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA Management Plans and with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
Recommendation
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for ASPA 170 Marion Nunataks, Charcot Island, Antarctic Peninsula (Attachment A).
