The exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty Area









The exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty Area
Introduction

The Intersessionnal Contact Group (ICG) chaired by France on the exercise of jurisdiction debated from September 2012 onward. The exchanges focused on some of the questions likely to generate difficulties in the enforcement of law in the Treaty Area presented by France at ATCM XXXV (WP28). They were based on fictive cases of damages to the environment and of an assault against a person. During these exchanges the participants (Australia, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, United States of America and ASOC) recalled their conception of the enforcement of law in the Treaty Area and the methods they favour to face unlawful acts that would be committed in the region.
Context

Resolution 2 (2012) recommended that “the Parties cooperate to institute discussion on issues related to the exercise of jurisdiction in the Antarctic Treaty area”. The ICG was created on that basis (ATCM XXXV Final Report, paragraph 47). It was decided that “France would act as convener, and would report to ATCM XXXVI on the progress made in the ICG” (paragraph 49) and that the ICG “should focus on an exchange on concrete situations” (paragraph 48), the reason for which France initiated the debate from practical fictive cases.
Synthesis of the main points evoked by the ICG

The exchanges of the ICG focused mainly on the competence of the Parties to hear cases of unlawful acts such as those described in the fictive cases, on the ways States can enforce their domestic law in the Treaty Area, on the existence and powers of personnel entrusted with law enforcement in the region and on the usefulness for Parties to develop information exchange on their domestic provisions related to these points, in order to anticipate situations in which unlawful facts committed in the Treaty Area would involve persons of different nationalities.

1-	The participants expressed their preference to deal with situations that would generate difficulties related to the exercise of jurisdiction on case-by-case basis and to avoid applying uniform rules in Antarctica, due to the limited number of infractions and not to prejudge the rules that would be used while the Parties’ domestic laws and legal traditions are different. Some Parties noted their domestic legislation already enable them to prosecute nationals who would have committed infraction in the Treaty Area.

2-	The participants insisted on their preference for each Party exercise its personal competence with respect to its nationals. Some Parties noted they extend this competence to foreign nationals that are residents on their territory, to individuals or legal entities that have their offices on their territory or that have a legal personality under their domestic law.
From contributions it can be presaged other forms of competence could be asserted: some Parties could assert their competence with respect to persons who would have conducted an activity on the basis of an EIA realized by their competent authority, with respect to persons inside the stations they manage, or with respect to persons who would have organized their activity from their territory.
These possibilities illustrate the complexity that could derive from unlawful acts involving persons of different nationalities. All the more as if the participants to the ICG noted they would prefer asserting their competence in respect to the alleged offender, this does not prejudge the possibility for other States to assert their competence if the victim was one of their nationals.

3-	Some participants evoked the persons who are entrusted by their Party’s domestic with exerting jurisdiction in the Treaty Area, usually the stations managers. Some Parties’ domestic law give the latter powers to (or to help other personnel to) gather evidence and testimonies, to conduct investigations, to initiate prosecutions against the alleged offender and/or to confine or remove from the station a person who would endanger the facilities or its staff.
France notes at this stage that a list of the Parties’ personnel legally entrusted with such powers along with their range of action (one/several station(s), the whole Treaty Area), the persons with respect of whom they are competent (nationals, any person in the station…) and their prerogatives does not seem to exist.

4-	Some participants noted that, without changing the way jurisdiction is currently handled, it could be useful for Parties to know better the domestic provisions that could be enforced in the Treaty Area, especially those related to the competence of their tribunals and to their personnel entrusted with exercising jurisdiction in the region. Improving this knowledge could be realized by developing information exchange between Parties.
It is true, as some Parties noted it, that Parties are already required to enter in the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) references of their domestic provisions enforceable in the Treaty Area. However, France notes that from a legal system to another rules related to the competence of the tribunals do not necessarily refer explicitly to Antarctica, which explains these provisions are not systematically put online. Besides, information related to the Parties’ personnel entrusted with the exercise of jurisdiction in the Treaty Area are not explicitly required on the EIES.
Possible ways for action for the ATCM

While sharing the idea of ​​the necessity to address situations that would generate difficulties related to jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis, France considers that continued work of the ATCM on this issue could help Parties to anticipate and prepare for such situations and to cope with them more efficiently.

1-	This work could aim at developing information exchange between Parties as to their domestic norms enforceable in the Treaty Area, and more specifically:
    • The criterion thanks to which tribunals can assert their competence to hear cases of unlawful acts committed in the Treaty Area, especially the legal link between a Party and the persons involved in these acts (nationals of the Party, foreign nationals with an EIA from the Party, any person in a station managed by the Party or that organized its activity from the territory of the Party…) and the status of this person (alleged offender, accomplice, victim);
    • The rules thanks to which the States can assert their competence when persons of different nationalities are involved in unlawful acts;
    • The rules that entrust some Parties’ personnel with exercising jurisdiction in the Treaty Area and especially their range of action, their powers and persons in respect of whom they can use these powers.
Besides, France notes that the consultations provided for by Article VIII.2 of the Treaty could be made easier thanks to an information exchange between Parties regarding their existing judicial cooperation agreements and the possibility or not to use them for unlawful acts committed in the Treaty Area by persons under their jurisdiction.

2-	This information exchange could be realized on the EIES in the section “Relevant National Legislation”. This section is currently organized as a single page and could be organized in sub-sections by topics of the legal texts: “Jurisdiction” (the topic of this WP) but also “Environment”, “EIAs”, “tourism”…

3-	It seems also important to keep the memory, each year, of incidents that would have consequences related to jurisdiction by aggregating – on the EIES or a distinct database – information on these incidents, such as the kind of unlawful acts committed, the State(s) that heard the case, on which criterion of competence, the nationality/ies of the persons involved, actions taken by public authority in the Treaty Area…
However, the aggregation of this information should, in no case, interfere with the work of the Parties’ Justices, but should only be used to list the practical solutions found to solve the above-mentioned situations (by who the investigation was conducted, how/by who a person was confined in a station and/or transferred to the Party’s territory, which Party asserted its competence to hear the case…).
The aggregation of such data would enable, in the long run, to identify the most common infractions in the Treaty Area and the solutions found to face them, in order to ease the work of the Parties to prevent and suppress them, especially for the cases in which several States could claim their competence.
Recommendations

Considering what precedes France recommends the ATCM adopt the draft Resolution attached at Annex A so that:
    • The ATCM remains seized of the questions related to the exercise of jurisdiction in the Treaty Area;
    • The ICG chaired by France studies, during the upcoming intersessional period, the means to develop the information exchange between Parties on the exercise of jurisdiction in the Treaty Area as well as the content of the information to be exchanged, especially on the competence of the Parties, their personnel entrusted with exercising jurisdiction in the Treaty Area and their judicial cooperation agreements;
    • The ICG determines a list of data to be aggregated on the incidents that would have an impact in terms of jurisdiction in the Treaty Area as well as the appropriate means to aggregate this information and make it accessible to the Parties.
