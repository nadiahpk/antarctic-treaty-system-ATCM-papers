Enhancing consultations in the use of logistical means to serve science in Antarctica
Introduction

In support of the working document submitted to ATCM by Chile, which reports on the outcomes of the intersessional contact group (ICG) that it presided (WP XX), France wishes to contribute to the promotion of a stronger cooperation in Antarctica by submitting to ATCM XXXVI a proposal to initiate discussions on how to optimise the logistical means in support of scientific research in Antarctica, reduce the impacts on the environment of those means and match the logistical needs of scientific research programmes with the capacities available at national Antarctic programmes.
Antarctica: a land for international cooperation

Scientific cooperation is one of the main objectives of the Antarctic Treaty and of other Antarctica-related international instruments that came after the Treaty (e.g.: CCAMLR and the Madrid Protocol). Since the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958), and until the 4th International Polar Year (2007-2009), international scientific cooperation in Antarctica had been successful and brought on board several multinational programmes. 

Up until today, the commitment of the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty ensured the development of cooperation on logistical - especially in respect of infrastructure and equipment - and scientific matters in the Treaty Area. Logistical cooperation among national Antarctic programmes in support of science is now a routine practice. Nevertheless, this logistical mechanism may be further improved.
Strengthen cooperation in the use of logistical means

Stronger consultations on the use of logistical means for science would open up interesting venues to optimise the use of those means; it would reduce the human footprint of activities carried out in support of scientific research and would also provide wider access to facilities that can host foreign scientists or research programmes.

It is to be noted that since the opening of the first facility in Antarctica, in 1904, there have been very few cases of shared stations. Out of the 80 "main Antarctic facilities" identified by COMNAP, only two of them are jointly run by more than one State, i.e. by two States at a time. This kind of cooperation could be considered in the future.

As regards those Antarctica regions where many stations are found, more or less close to one another, the strengthening of consultations in the use of logistical means for scientific research should help optimise the means deployed and reduce the environmental footprint of research activities carried out in the areas concerned.
Increased cooperation in the use of logistical means in favour of science would, undoubtedly, benefit the development of research in Antarctica and, especially, international research programmes.

In addition to individual bilateral cooperation initiatives between national Antarctic programmes, COMNAP stands as the institution that is most capable of assisting the Parties in strengthening the coordination of their logistical efforts in favour of scientific research and promoting international scientific research in Antarctica. As provided under its Constitution, COMNAP's mission is to serve “as a forum to develop practices that improve effectiveness of activities in an environmentally responsible manner” and “facilitate and promote international partnerships”.

Building on the work of the ICG under the presidency of Chile, France encourages discussions that may be conducted in the ATCM forum on the ways and means to strengthen consultations on the use of logistical means for science in Antarctica. 
Recommendation

In view of the above, France wishes to propose that ATCM XXXVI adopt the draft resolution in Annex A, so that the Parties may initiate discussions on methods that would facilitate consultation on the use of logistical means in support of scientific research, reduce the environmental impacts of those logistical means, and match the logistical needs of scientific research programmes with the capacities available at national Antarctic programmes.

In support of this exercise at its early stages, and to ensure that the discussions thereon are based on the best information available, it appears important to have an exhaustive study which: 
    • would identify, on the basis of contributions to be made by national Antarctic programmes, those facilities and stations  in Antarctica which are fit to host, as well as any formal or informal logistical cooperation arrangements which may exist between national Antarctica programmes; and
    • would also analyse the current practice in hosting foreign researchers and scientific programmes in the stations managed by the Parties.

The conducting of such a study would gain in being entrusted to COMNAP who, where appropriate, would report to ATCM XXXVII.
Annex A
Draft Resolution X (2013)
The Representatives, 

Reaffirming their willingness to ensure that Antarctica remains a continent dedicated to scientific research;

Recalling that scientific cooperation is a major objective under the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection (Madrid Protocol); 

Also recalling Resolution 3 (2002) on improving cooperation in Antarctica; 

Convinced of the interest for all Parties to extend cooperation on logistical support to scientific research in Antarctica, on the basis of existing means and facilities;

Also convinced of the shared benefit that may be derived from the optimal use of logistical means in support of scientific research in Antarctica; 

Calling for the logistical means deployed in Antarctica to be used in such a way as to limit their impacts on the environment and to help in matching logistical needs of research programmes with the capacities of the national Antarctic programmes; 

Decide: 
to initiate discussions on methods to:
    • further improve consultations on the use of logistical means in support of scientific research in Antarctica with the aim of limiting their impact on the environment; and 
    • match the logistical needs of scientific research programmes with the capacities available at national Antarctic programmes.
