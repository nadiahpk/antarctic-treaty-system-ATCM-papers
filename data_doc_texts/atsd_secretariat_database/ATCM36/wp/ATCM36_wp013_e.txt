Revised Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 147, Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island
Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom
Summary
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 147 Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island, and has determined that only minor amendments are required. The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan.
Background
The United Kingdom has conducted a review of the Management Plan for ASPA 147 Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island, with reference to Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011). 
ASPA 147 Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island (70°48’S, 68°30’W, approximately 180 km2) was designated originally in 1989 as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 29 Ablation Point – Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island, through Recommendation XV-6, after a proposal by the United Kingdom. 

The primary reason for the designation of Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights as ASPA 147 is to protect scientific values, relating particularly to the geology, geomorphology and ecology of this extensive ablation area.  The Area contains exposed rocks spanning the Jurassic – Cretaceous boundary, an exceptional and unique contiguous geomorphological record of glacier and ice-shelf fluctuations extending over several thousand years, two perennially frozen freshwater lakes which have the unusual property of contact with the saline waters of George VI Sound and exceptional communities of terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna.
Summary of amendments
A revised Management Plan for ASPA 147 is provided at Attachment A. There are no major changes to the Area description or management measures. The amendments are summarised as follows:
    • An introduction has been added, including a statement of the primary reason for designation.
    • A reference to the Environmental Domains Analysis (Resolution 3 (2008)) has been added to the introduction.
    • A reference to the Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (Resolution 6 (2012)) has been added to the introduction.
    • A requirement that visitors take precautions against the introduction of non-native organisms to the Area, and guidance on appropriate precautions, has been added to Section 7vi. 
    • Section 6(ii) Access to the Area has been revised.
    • Improved maps are incorporated.
    • A range of editorial amendments have been made throughout, including for consistency with the provisions of other ASPA management plans and with the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
Recommendation
The United Kingdom recommends that the CEP approves the attached revised management plan for ASPA 147 Ablation Valley and Ganymede Heights, Alexander Island (Attachment A).
