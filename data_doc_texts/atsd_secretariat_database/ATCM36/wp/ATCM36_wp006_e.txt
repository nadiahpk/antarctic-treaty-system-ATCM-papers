Revision of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 141 Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay
A working paper submitted by Japan
Summary
Japan has undertaken a review of the Management Plan for ASPA No.141 Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay.  In submitting this revised Plan, Japan recommends that the CEP ask the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans to undertake an intersessional review and to report back to CEP XVII.
Background
The primary reason for the designation of Yukidori Valley (69º14'30''S, 39º46'00''E), Langhovde, Lützow-Holm Bay, as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area is to protect typical continental Antarctic fellfield ecosystem and to conduct long-term monitoring programs.
The Area was originally designated in Recommendation XIV-5 (1987, SSSI No.22) after a proposal by Japan. A management plan for the Area was adopted under Recommendation XVI-7 (1991) and revised under Measure 1 (2000). The Management Plan has been revised and updated by Japan from 2012 to 2013.  The revised plan is attached for the consideration of the CEP (Annex 1). 
The proposed revision includes the following major changes to the provisions of the existing Management Plan:
    • Redrafting of the text into the format recommended in the ‘Guide to the preparation of management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas’ [Resolution 2 (2011)]
    • Introduction.  An introduction has been added that describes the primary reasons for the Area’s designation as an ASPA and the contribution of the Area to the Antarctic protected areas system. The Area’s position within the framework of the ‘Environmental Domains Analysis for the Antarctic Continent’ has been described in [Resolution 3 (2008)].
    • 2. Aims. Measures against the non-native species have been added since the "Guide" provides that the conditions for issuing permits of activities in the protected areas should be stated.
    • 7. Conditions for permits. An educational purpose has been added as a requirement for the issuance of a permit.
    • 7(vi). Restrictions on materials and organisms which may be brought into the Area. A provision to regulate the introduction of soil has been added.
    • 7(ix). Disposal of waste. Dumping of human wastes into the sea may be approved in the current Plan but liquid-human wastes only may be approved in this Plan.
    • 7(xi).Requirement for reports. It has been updated because the reporting format has been changed as specified in "the Guide". Also, a six-month deadline for the submission of a report is set.
    • Map 4 is replaced with the new one to show the correct positioning of the entry point in the map.
Recommendation
Given that the Management Plan for ASPA No.141 Yukidori Valley has been amended, Japan recommends that the CEP ask the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans to undertake a more detailed intersessional review of the revised Plan and report back to CEP XVII.
