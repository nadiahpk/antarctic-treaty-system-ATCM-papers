Proposed Criteria for de-designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA)








Proposed Criteria for de-designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs)

Working Paper submitted by Norway, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom

Summary

The Working Paper presents a proposal for criteria and process for de-designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. Norway, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom propose that the CEP endorse the criteria and suggested process for ASPA de-designation, and discuss how to incorporate it into existing sets of tools.  


    1. Background

In recent years the CEP has been asked to consider proposals to de-designate Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs). To date, CEP has been asked to consider the following proposals: 
    • ASPA 107: Emperor Island, Dion Island – refer ia. to discussion reflected in para 133-137 of the final report from CEP XIX
    • ASPA 118: Summit of Mount Melbourne, Victoria Land – amalgamated into ASPA 175 (Measure 13 (2014))
    • ASPA 130: ‘Tramway Ridge’, Mount Erebus, Ross Island – amalgamated into ASPA 175 (Measure 13 (2014)) 
    • ASMA 3 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, Georg V Land, East Antarctica – incorporated into ASPA 162 (Measure 9 (2014))
    • ASPA 114: Northern Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands – the values were no longer there (Measure 16 (2014))
    • ASPA 144: Chile Bay (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands – Pending. 


The Committee has agreed on the importance of the Antarctic protected area system being dynamic but has also recognised that de-designations should not be taken lightly, and that rigorous consideration is required. As such the Committee welcomed Norway’s stated intention to develop suggested guidance/criteria for delisting ASPAs, as reflected in the 5YWP adopted by CEP XX.  At CEPXXI, Norway advised that it was continuing to work on the guidance/criteria and intended to bring forward a proposal for consideration at CEP XXII. 

Norway has over the last few years, in consultation with interested Parties, worked on developing a set of criteria, as well as a proposed process for de-designation of ASPAs. On the basis of this work, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK have put forward a set of criteria for de-designation, as well as an outline of a possible process for ASPA de-designation for the consideration of the Committee. 

    2. Criteria for de-designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA)

The proposed criteria outline the documentation that should be included to allow the Committee to assess the potential de-designation of an ASPA (see Attachment A). 

The types of documentation that should be included in an assessment of the status of the value(s) of an Area that is being considered for de-designation includes: 
    • an assessment of the status of the values the Area was designated to protect, as well 
    • an assessment of potential new values that have emerged since the establishment of the ASPA 
    • an assessment of the pressures on those values (if any). 
    • monitoring data relevant to the values, as appropriate, an expert assessment regarding the likelihood and ability of reestablishment of any values that have declined or disappeared
    • consideration and documentation on whether the Area has a value as a component of a holistic system of protected areas within a systematic geographic environmental framework; and,
    • consideration and documentation on whether the Area could have continued value as a protected area based on it having had no or limited impact as a result of its protected status. 


    3. Process for de-designation

The proposed process for de-designation is outlined in Attachment A. It includes guidance: (i) on how the CEP should be asked to consider the potential de-designation of an ASPA, (ii) on the potential outcomes following an initial notification to the CEP, and (iii) the process going forward for a potential de-designation of an ASPA. 

In the attachment, it is suggested that Parties proposing de-designation first present the CEP with an initial notification in the form of a Working Paper to the meeting. This paper should include the reasons behind the proposed de-designation. The Committee could then choose to (i) immediately de-designate based on the information that has been presented, (ii) decide that the Area requires continued protection, or (iii) that the CEP requires further information to conclude. 

In cases where further information is needed to conclude on the matter, it is proposed that the proponents of a de-designation performs further monitoring/investigation to support the proposal and subsequently submit, a Working Paper to the CEP presenting a full assessment against the criteria for consideration by the Committee. 

    4. Recommendation

We propose that the CEP endorse the criteria and suggested process for ASPA de-designation, and discuss how to incorporate it into existing sets of tools.
