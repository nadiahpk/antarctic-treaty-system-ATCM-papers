Future Antarctic Science Challenges
Outcomes of Intersessional Discussions on future Antarctic science challenges
Working Paper submitted by Australia
Summary
This paper reports on informal intersessional work convened by Australia to discuss future Antarctic science challenges. Over the past two intersessional periods, participants discussed strategic science plans and priorities, with a view to identifying areas of mutual scientific interest, and considering opportunities for collaboration. The paper summarises the outcomes of those discussions, and presents conclusions and observations resulting from this exchange of information on science priorities and strategic plans. Australia as Convener recommends that the ATCM refers to this information in addressing the related Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan priority item on strategic science priorities scheduled for attention at this ATCM.
Background
Since 2013 the ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan (MYSWP) has included a priority:
‘to share and discuss strategic science priorities in order to identify and pursue opportunities for collaboration as well as capacity building in science, particularly in relation to climate change’.
At ATCM XL (2017) the ATCM included a dedicated agenda item on ‘Future Antarctic Science Challenges’. The Meeting considered WP 1 Future Antarctic Science Challenges – A UK Perspective (United Kingdom), WP 30 International cooperation to advance shared Antarctic science objectives (Australia) and other relevant papers. Several Parties reported that their National Antarctic Programs had developed, or were developing, strategic science plans for Antarctic research. There was broad agreement that information sharing on Antarctic science priorities, and collaboration on science programs, should continue. The Meeting welcomed Australia’s offer to lead an informal intersessional group to discuss the topic of future Antarctic science challenges, and the ATCM updated the MYSWP accordingly (Decision 7 (2017)).
At ATCM XLI (2018) Australia provided a progress report on the informal intersessional discussions conducted in the 2017/18 intersessional period (ATCM XLI/IP37), including a preliminary analysis of the responses showing a number of broadly shared high-level Antarctic scientific priorities. Given that the modified agenda for ATCM XLI did not allow for substantive discussion on science matters, the informal discussion was continued through the next intersessional period. The ATCM Multi-year Strategic Work Plan (Decision 3 (2018)) was updated to indicate that ATCM XLII (2019) would ‘Consider outcomes of intersessional discussions on strategic science priorities’. 
Conduct of the informal intersessional discussions
The informal discussions over the two intersessional periods were conducted via email. As convener, Australia provided discussion papers and a survey to solicit input from participants. An initial invitation to participate was issued to all Parties, Observers and Experts, and responses were received from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Finland, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Romania, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and ASOC.
The agreed broad objectives of the discussions were to advance the priority identified in the MYSWP by:
    • discussing Parties strategic science plans/priorities;
    • identifying any areas of mutual scientific interests;
    • considering any opportunities for collaboration; and
    • reporting to the ATCM.
Participants were invited to provide information regarding their national Antarctic science plans and priorities, and on collaboration between Parties to address shared objectives at the strategic level. In addition, participants were invited to contribute to a compilation of existing major international science projects and programs.
Outcomes of the informal intersessional discussions
The following summaries reflect input received from participants in the informal intersessional discussion, and also draw on relevant information presented in recent meeting papers submitted to the ATCM by other Parties.
National Antarctic science objectives
Most participants in the discussions have defined national Antarctic science objectives. For some nations active in both the Antarctic and the Arctic, these were expressed as joint ‘polar’ objectives.
Two broad approaches are taken by Parties to determine these objectives. Many establish their national science objectives in a ‘top down’ manner, with objectives determined at a national level through government and/or national program planning. Others follow a ‘bottom up’ process, reflecting an approach where researchers or research organisations respond to open calls for proposals and seek support for Antarctic research that aligns with their individual or organisational expertise and research interests.
Participants in most cases also reported that their objective setting is informed by external research prioritisation and coordination schemes, in addition to broader national priorities, funding schemes, and areas of research excellence. Many participants had reference in particular to science priorities and research programs facilitated through SCAR, highlighting the importance of the connection between SCAR and the Antarctic Treaty System. Other drivers of national objective setting included research priorities relevant to the forums of the Antarctic Treaty system (ATCM and CCAMLR, the priority items in the CEP 5 year work plan, and CCAMLR Scientific Committee and its working groups). Priorities were also informed by the science needs of other international organisations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Several participants acknowledged the close connections between their Arctic and Antarctic science objectives. Some assign a priority to comparative polar research on Arctic and Antarctic processes. 
Participants also shared information on their science strategic planning processes. Most indicated that they either have, or have under development, a strategic plan or strategy to deliver their Antarctic science objectives. These strategies vary in scope, detail and time frame. Many participants had relatively long term science plans (10 year plans were common). 
Participants also acknowledged the range of other processes relevant to the Parties’ discussions on Antarctic science priorities and challenges, including the CEP’s work to identify and promote the science needed to better understand and address the environmental challenges facing Antarctica, (which were endorsed by the CEP and reflected in the CEP 5-year work plan), the SCAR Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Horizon Scan, and the related COMNAP Antarctic Roadmap Challenge project.
Participants also had reference to previous resolutions and decisions of the ATCM on research and cooperation, which include priorities collectively identified by the Parties through the ATCM. A list of relevant ATCM instruments relating to research and cooperation is at Attachment A. 
Shared Antarctic science priorities 
Crosscutting issues
A number of ‘cross cutting’ issues were identified (as well as being identified as research priorities in their own right), including climate change, sea level rise, human impacts, and environmental protection.
These issues provide the context for, or interact with, many of the other identified research priorities. For many participants, one or more of their research priorities were expressed in the context of cross cutting issues. Two examples were: research priorities relating to ecosystems were in many cases focused on understanding climate change impacts on ecosystems or ecosystem components; and, research priorities relating to cryosphere and ice sheet dynamics were often aimed at understanding sea level rise.
Some research priorities related to Antarctica as a platform or location for observations, in support of Antarctic-specific and broader research questions, including astronomy, astrophysics, climate, and weather observations. Some participants noted that Antarctica provides opportunities for indispensable research that can only be pursued in Antarctica, even where the research does not relate to Antarctica itself. 
Priority areas
Key priority areas were identified across the participant group. Many participants identified research priorities in the following discipline areas: 
    • Antarctica’s role in global climate systems, and climate system interactions, including linkages and coupling between atmosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and oceans. Climate change and climate history.  
    • Climate change impacts on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
    • Cryosphere research – ice sheet dynamics, evolution and history, impacts on sea level rise, role of cryosphere in global systems, sea ice dynamics.
    • Antarctic species and ecosystems – biodiversity, species research, ecosystem processes, spatial distribution, vulnerability, impacts of and resilience to environmental change, ecosystem and species conservation and management, predictive modelling, monitoring, and evolution and adaptation. Many participants had priorities distinguishing between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Some participants had priorities for marine ecosystem research with a management focus. 
    • Physical and chemical oceanography – Southern Ocean/global ocean circulation, variability of Southern Ocean circulation, ocean-atmosphere interactions, ocean acidification, and sea ice processes.
    • Geological sciences – geodynamics, geophysics, and geological processes, interaction between the earth crust and ice sheet including sea level effects, geological history, soils landscapes and permafrost, mantle and magma dynamics, response of geosystems to environmental change.
    • Upper atmosphere science – space and atmospheric physics, upper atmosphere dynamics, space weather and atmospheric chemistry (e.g. ozone).
    • Environmental protection and impact of human activities – vulnerability, sensitivity to change, spatial protection, methods to minimise and remediate impacts, harvesting and marine resources, tourism, assessing and monitoring pollutants and marine plastics (including globally sourced and marine), science to inform decision making. 

Other areas of research priority indicated by some participants included:
    • Medical research and human physiology
    • Meteorology 
    • Heritage preservation and management
    • Bioprospecting and biotechnology
    • Mapping and hydrographic survey
    • Antarctic data management
    • Antarctica as an analogue for space

Some participants, within their science priorities and strategies, acknowledge the importance of ‘frontier science’ or science focused on new and emerging issues, including where new technology or environmental changes open up new opportunities. These participants provide mechanisms to support such research where it is not identified in other priority areas. Examples include research to search for life in sub-glacial lakes and streams, and research in areas previously covered by ice shelves. 
Science priorities directed towards implementation of the Environmental Protocol 
The participants discussed the connection between their Antarctic science objectives and the implementation of the Environmental Protocol. For many participants there was a strong relationship between national Antarctic science priorities and the implementation of the Environmental Protocol, particularly in areas such as the impact of human activities, biodiversity conservation and change, and area protection. Some priorities were specifically directed towards the priorities identified by the CEP in its five-year work plan. 
Participants noted that in many cases individual scientific objectives and research topics support decision making within the CEP, with connections between research themes or programs and the implementation of the Environmental Protocol. Participants cited environmental trends and sensitivity to change, vulnerability and spatial protection, human impact prevention, mitigation and remediation, technologies to minimise environmental impacts, bioremediation for fuel spills, and research on the impacts of tourism activities. Some Parties also noted their support for the work of the CEP through educational and outreach activities. 
Geographic focus
Participants shared information on any geographic focus of their research priorities. For most, local or regional proximity to national research stations was a key (but generally not an exclusive) factor. Some participants supported research activity across a wide geographic region, Antarctic-wide in some cases, often drawing on opportunities presented by collaboration and sharing of access to station facilities. Some participants noted that this could be a key to achieving greater regional diversity in achieving Antarctic science objectives. 
Geographic focuses also included regions where specific management tools are applied. One example of a regional research priority area was the Ross Sea region MPA. 
In addition to the locations in which research was conducted, some participants identified priorities relating to geographical linkages between Antarctica and other areas – for example, interactions between Antarctic processes and the South American continent were a focus for some. 
Antarctic science collaboration
Participants shared information about scientific objectives, research questions, regions or disciplines where there is alignment with other Parties, or where cooperation has been or would be particularly beneficial. A commitment to collaboration was evident, and many examples at different levels were cited, including bilateral and multi-party collaborations, and through large international research programs. A number of participants also indicated a desire for further collaborations, for example to support research that requires access to more remote terrestrial and marine sites to conduct fieldwork and deploy instrumentation, given the significant cost required and associated logistical complexities, and to support research to address pressing knowledge gaps.
Participants highlighted that coordination applies not only to field research and in-situ observations but also to analyses of existing and new data, and in ex-situ modelling (for example process models, operational weather and sea ice models, and coupled climate models). 
Participants also identified opportunities for greater collaboration and sharing of research facilities and platforms including research stations, and the benefits of collaboration in this respect for Parties with emerging science programs.
Information shared by participants demonstrated that while some collaborations are established through formal international agreements (for example MoUs) others are developed on a project by project basis, led by researchers or institutions, or via the science coordination functions of SCAR and other international bodies, such as the International Hydrographic Organisation and the World Meteorological Organization. This served to emphasise the global application and implications of Antarctic science outcomes, especially in key fields such as climate change research.
Many collaborations cited were driven by shared regional proximity. In addition, examples of significant multinational scientific research programs coordinated by other international bodies or consortia were noted as key opportunities for collaboration. Such examples included International Partnership in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS), Antarctic Thresholds – Ecosystems Resilience and Adaptation (AnT-ERA), International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO), Beyond –EPICA program to drill for the oldest ice in Antarctica, Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS), Antarctic Near-shore and Terrestrial Observing System (AnTOS), and World Meteorological Organization Year of Polar Prediction (WMO YOPP). Antarctic and Southern Ocean regional contributions to global collaborative programs and observing networks, in a range of disciplines including oceanography (reference observations, ocean carbon, ocean acidification), geosciences, and physical sciences were also highlighted.
Conclusions
Participants expressed a strong commitment to, and desire for cooperation and collaboration to deliver important Antarctic science. Scientific cooperation and collaboration is currently an integral feature in Antarctic programs, however mechanisms to enhance, facilitate, and further support such cooperation would be welcomed, in particular by those Parties with emerging and expanding science programs. 
Participants noted the benefits of exchanging information on science priorities and science strategic plans. The discussion provided information that can assist the Parties in understanding the priorities of others, and in considering opportunities for enhanced collaboration. The ATCM is invited to consider the following observations: 
    • Those Parties with science strategic plans could be encouraged to make them available, on a voluntary basis, to other Parties. The long-term nature of many plans would make this worthwhile and in most cases there would be a low burden on Parties to regularly update information (a number of mechanisms to facilitate this would be available, including via the Electronic Information Exchange System or on the Secretariat web site). 
    • Geographic-focused collaborations are common, and facilitated by proximity of Antarctic facilities, and existing regional collaboration mechanisms. Further opportunities for geographic-focused collaboration are likely to exist. Sharing of information about priorities and aspirations for research in particular geographic areas where Parties are currently less active, or where there is a particular research question that would benefit from a collaborative ‘campaign’ approach may be of value. 
    • Considerable alignment is evident in the science priorities of participants. Parties may wish to make themselves aware of the priorities of other Parties to consider synergies and opportunities, including gaining an awareness of shared geographic and disciplinary priorities. 
    • Opportunities for cooperation exist not only in field research and in-situ observations but also in, for example, analyses of existing and new data, and in ex-situ modelling (for example process models, operational weather and sea ice models, and coupled climate models). 
    • Parties may wish to share information and experiences about access and sharing of facilities and platforms. Further discussion of what mechanisms and arrangements that Parties may have in place, or that may be required, should they seek to enhance opportunities for international access and sharing of facilities may be of value. 
Recommendation
Australia, as convener of the intersessional discussion, recommends that the ATCM refers to the information in this paper in its further consideration of the Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan priority item to ‘Consider outcomes of intersessional discussions on strategic science priorities’.
