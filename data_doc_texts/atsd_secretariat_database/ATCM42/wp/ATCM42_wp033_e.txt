Third report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach

Working Paper submitted by Bulgaria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, Spain and UK
Summary
At Beijing, China in ATCM XL, Parties decided to continue the work of the intersessional contact group (ICG) on Education and Outreach, following a number of Terms of reference related to Education and Outreach. As last year`s meeting in Buenos Aires was with a special status, there were no discussions on Education and Outreach issues. This paper aims to provide an initial report on the discussions taken within the ICG during two period of intersessional work, and recommends considerations by the ATCM of the outcomes of the intersessional work.
Background
After recognizing the need for better public and educational outreach activities regarding Antarctica during ATCM XXXVII in Brasilia, an ICG on Education and outreach was established during ATCM XXXVIII in Sofia. At the same ATCM, a very successful workshop on Education and Outreach was held: ninety seven participants from thirty seven parties, observers and experts took part in the workshop.  During ATCM XXXIX in Santiago, Bulgaria introduced WP 24 First Report on the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach, jointly prepared with Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and the United Kingdom.  The ATCM recognised the contribution of parties and the usefulness of the ICG’s work. Parties were advised to continue to use and promote the forum on Education and Outreach to share information on Education and Outreach activities and events with each other. Contributions to Education and Outreach activities from an Antarctic Treaty Perspective remain within the Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan of the ATCM. 
As stated in the final report of ATCM XXXX in Beijing, paragraph 185, the Meeting agreed to continue the ICG on Education and Outreach for another intersessional period, and agreed to the following terms of reference:
    • foster collaboration at both the national and international level, on Education and Outreach;
    • identify key international activities/events related to education and outreach for possible engagement by the Antarctic Treaty Parties; 
    • share results of educational and outreach initiatives that demonstrate the work of Antarctic Treaty Parties in managing the Antarctic Treaty area; 
    • emphasise ongoing environmental protection initiatives that had been informed by scientific observations and results, in order to reinforce the importance of the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection; 
    • promote related education and outreach activities by Experts and Observers, and encourage cooperation with these groups; 
    •  discuss the possibility for creation of an Antarctic Education and Outreach section at the ATS website.

Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Chile, Portugal and the United Kingdom, with the recent addition of Spain, will continue to form the Core Group which will moderate this forum.
Method of Operation
The ICG operates using the online ATCM Discussion Forum, under the topic ‘ICG on Education and Outreach’. The discussion is open to all Parties, Observers and Experts. Currently there are 38 points of contact listed as participating in the ICG. Parties and observers actively participated in two intersessional sessions from 2017-18 and 2018-19. The first stage of the work of ICG began with an opening announcement by the convener at 28th of September 2017 and at 26 of October 2018 respectively for the second year of the work ICG.
The work plans for the both sessions were arranged in three stages:
    • Stage 1: Opening announcement with opening notes, proposed timetable and working scheme;
    • Stage 2:  Requesting parties to provide initial comments, proposals and sharing information on ToR issues;
    • Stage 3: Preparation and submission of Working Paper report of the ICG (at the end of the second year regarding the special status of the meeting in Buenos Aires in 2018).


Discussions
Intersessional session 2017-18
A total number of 18 posts and 371 views were noted, from more than 5 parties observers and experts (including Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania, Venezuela, IAATO). During 2018 the forum shared information about different education activates, such as APECS-EPB Webinar: The Antarctic Treaty and the protection of the environment, the 4th annual APECS International Online Conference and Workshop on Polar Education organized by the University of Coimbra.
International educational activities, such as Antarctica Day  and the APECS International Polar Weeks are gaining momentum as focal points to bring polar scientists and schools together. Digital technologies such as Skype and Webinars provide effective online platforms to connect these communities. 

Intersessional session 2018-19
Engagement in the ICG forum continues to grow, as its usefulness for sharing best practice. A total number of 22 posts and 381 views were noted (up to 15.05.2019), from more than 9 parties, observers and experts (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, United Kingdom and COMNAP).  
Evidence from the forum confirms that there continues to be enthusiasm for promoting international initiatives designed to engage different audiences in Antarctic science, environmental issues and operational activity. 
Fourteen discussion topics focussed on Antarctica Day, Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) POLAR WEEKS, and a special issue of POLAR RECORD to mark the legacy of International Polar Year. During 2019 a special issue of POLAR RECORD will celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, and a Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) half-day Education and Outreach Workshop is planned. 
Some parties (the Czech Republic and Turkey) shared the completed list of their education and outreach activities over the years. Others reported activities which have been organized on domestic level. Good examples of that are (Bulgaria) national educational program with the aim to build a society of active people working in the educational sector, both as teachers and as pupils, who are united by the idea of the protection and exploration of Antarctica; and (UK) outreach works on engaging the public and the stakeholders with the project of the build and launch of the new polar research ship and to create awareness of the large investment and benefits for science, industry and society. 
The sharing of communication policies and guidance for the use of social media from some parties (UK) has proven to be very useful for many. 

Recommendations
The ICG recommends that the ATCM, following previous WP:

    • Recognises the usefulness of the Forum on Education and Outreach
    • Advises the Parties to keep promoting the usage of the Forum to provide information of their activities related to Education and Outreach
    • Assess key international activities/events related to education and outreach that Parties can engage
    • Advises the Parties to continue to promote not only Antarctica and Antarctic research through their Education and Outreach Activities but the Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol itself.
