Proposal to redesign the format of the list of Historic Sites and Monuments
Working Paper submitted by Argentina.



Abstract
Argentina is presenting a proposal to redesign the format of the list of Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs), by virtue of the incorporation of new content that has emerged from the recent advances in the relevant existing standards. Additionally, Argentina proposes supplementing the concept of a “list” with a more dynamic concept that includes the creation of new “visualisation” tools and formats for information relative to HSMs, on Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) webpage platform. 

Introduction
During CEP XXI (2018), the Committee agreed that the ICG that worked on the development of the guidance material for conservation approaches for the management of heritage objects had identified various general issues that merited deeper consideration (paragraph 113. CEP XXI. Final Report). In particular, the Committee accepted that there would be value in considering the format of the list of HSMs in greater detail. As was reflected in the Five-Year Work Plan of the CEP, Argentina would work towards achieving this.

With the aim of advancing in this task, Argentina carried out an analysis of the background information and regulations in force. This facilitated the identification of content or “fields” of information that are not currently available on the Measure 9 (2016) list (https://ats.aq/documents/recatt/att596_s.pdf), but to which the existing tools in use make reference. 

In addition, Argentina analysed the best way to incorporate this information into the list under the premise of keeping the format of the list as is required by article 8.3 of Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental Protection, while adding additional tools to make the management of the information more dynamic and make the most of the possibilities offered by the ATS web platform.

Sources of information
Argentina worked under the premise of incorporating into the HSMs table only information that had been debated beforehand and had received support from the Parties. As such, the sources selected were the following:

    1. Information contained in the current list, in accordance with Measure 9 (2016).
    2. Paragraphs 127 to 134 of the Final Report of CEP XV (2012) in relation to the final Report of the informal debates about HSMs submitted by Argentina under Working Paper 46, which includes a Table with information that should be considered when the descriptions of the HSMs are developed.
    3. The “Guidelines for the assessment and management of Heritage in Antarctica” adopted through Resolution 2 (2018).
    4. The information requested under the Annex to Resolution 3 (2018), “Guide to the Presentation of Working Papers Containing Proposals for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, Antarctic Specially Managed Areas or Historic Sites and Monuments”.



Proposal for content to incorporate into the list
Based on the sources of information used, Argentina identified a series of additional fields to incorporate into the list of HSMs. It is proposed that the list would contain the following fields:

    • Number 
    • Name*
    • Original Proposing Party
    • Party undertaking Management
    • Type*
    • Geographical Location
    • Physical features of the environment and cultural and local context
    • Description of the object
    • Conservation Status*
    • Description of the historical event
    • Description of the historical context*
    • Applicable criteria in accordance with Resolution 3 (2009)*
    • Management tools*
    • Designation/Modifications
    • Photos*

*Fields which are currently not included in the Measure 9 (2016) list. The “Description of the object” and “Description of the historical event” fields would be included in the “Description” field of the current list.

The table from Annex 1 includes information about the original source of the requirement, alongside definitions, examples and observations about scenarios in which they would be necessary. 

Additionally, in Annex II, Argentina provides a completed list template, with some examples of HSMs. 

With regards to the availability of the information, the requirements included in the “COVER SHEET” from Resolution 3 (2018) would allow for the inclusion of the information included in these new fields for new HSMs proposed from now on. However, with regard to the HSMs that have already been listed, this expansion of the database is an opportunity for the Parties to improve the information currently available regarding HSMs that they are in charge of. The parties will be able to debate and agree to the method and deadlines for providing the information required to complete the list. Among the options are the provision of this information through Working Papers to the CEP or the establishment of an intersessional contact group that, through an ad hoc forum, would allow the parties to make information about the HSMs under their management available to members and to exchange views with a view to agreeing on the incorporation of said information into the list. This information, once compiled, could be regularly presented to the Committee for its approval and inclusion on the webpage.

Possible formats for presentation of the information

As stated above, article 8.3 of Annex V to the Protocol refers to the existence of a list of Historic Sites and Monuments. This requirement is covered through the adoption of Measures, the last one adopted being Measure 9 (2016), “Annex: Revised List of Historic Sites and Monuments”. 

Additionally, the ATS has developed more dynamic tools to access information on HSMs, through the ZAP Database. By accessing this database, it is possible to find the details of each HSM. A location map can also be accessed. 


The incorporation of additional fields to the list would simply involve an expansion of the database  that is currently available on the ATS website and the ZAP database. This would make it possible to generate reports and “information sheets” about each of the HSMs. Additionally, the information could be presented in a printable format, in a similar style to the “Site Guidelines for Visitors” (SGVs). These tools would not only be useful for the management of the HSMs, but they could also provide an educational role, contributing to the dissemination of information on historical Antarctic heritage. 

In order to obtain these new “output” formats for the information, it will not only be necessary to modify the fields from the list of the HSMs, but also to request that the ATS develops these new tools.

Recommendation

Argentina recommends to the CEP that it:

    1. Approve the proposal for the incorporation of new fields of information to the list of Historic Sites and Monuments contained in this WP; 
    2. Establish the method through which the information should be provided for the HSMs already listed in Measure 9 (2016).
    3. Update Measure 9 (2016) in order to incorporate the modifications;
    4. Invite the Parties to provide information for these new fields about the HSMs that they are in charge of, through the method agreed in point 2, with the aim of completing the database as much as possible. 
    5. Request the ATS to modify the information fields of the list of HSMs on its webpage and develop the additional tools proposed in the “ZAP database” section, including geographical co-ordinates of the HSMs in the map/maps/Geographical Information Systems that it develops.
