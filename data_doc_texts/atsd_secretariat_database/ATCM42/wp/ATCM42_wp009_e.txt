Review of Management Plan for the Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 175: High altitude geothermal sites in the Ross Sea region (including parts of the summits of Mount Erebus, Ross Island and Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittmann in northern Victoria Land)

Working Paper submitted by New Zealand and the United States
Introduction
New Zealand and the United States have undertaken a review of the management plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 175: High altitude geothermal sites in the Ross Sea region (including parts of the summits of Mount Erebus, Ross Island and Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittmann in northern Victoria Land).  

The review was conducted as a desktop exercise with reference to Annex V of the Protocol and the Revised Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas appended to Resolution 2 (2011). The management plan was circulated for comment to scientists and environmental managers of National Antarctic Programmes operating within the Ross Sea region who conduct research in the Area and have visited the site, including Australia, China, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, Spain and the United States.

The review concluded that the current management provisions remain appropriate to protect the values of the Area and that no changes to the management plan are required.
If the Committee agrees with this conclusion, the management plan for ASPA 175, held under Measure 13 (2014) remains extant until otherwise decided.

Recommendations
New Zealand and the United States recommend that the CEP endorses the conclusion of its review of the management plan for ASPA 175 and agrees that no changes to the current management plan are required, and that a further review of the management plan be undertaken no later than 2024.
