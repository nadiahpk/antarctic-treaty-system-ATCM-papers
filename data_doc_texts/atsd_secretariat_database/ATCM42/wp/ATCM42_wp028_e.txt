Notification by the Consultative Parties of the list of Observers under Art. VII of the Antarctic Treaty 

Working Paper presented by Argentina and Chile



Abstract

The notification of the list of observers to carry out inspections under the Antarctic Treaty and its Environmental Protocol as undertaken at present by some Consultative Parties does not necessarily conform to the regulations in force. Making such a notification directly through the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty now appears to be a faster and more efficient practice. To this end, and through a new explanatory Decision, the draft of which is attached, the proponents propose revoking Decision 7 (2013) in order to clearly establish the procedure to follow in these cases.

Background 

Under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the Consultative Parties have the right to designate observers to carry out inspections on the Antarctic continent. The Antarctic Treaty, in turn, prescribes in its Article VII, that observers shall be nationals of the Contracting Party that designates them and that their names shall be communicated to every other Contracting Party, not only when they are designated but also when their appointment is terminated.
	
In addition to this provision, Decision 7 (2013) of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Brussels (ATCM XXXVI), adopted on 29 May 2013, asserts: 

“1) That the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) should inform the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, in addition to notification through diplomatic channels, of the designation of Observers to carry out inspections, the date of designation as well as termination of such designations; and that the Secretariat be required to notify all ATCP1 contacts, as notified under Recommendation XIII-1, Paragraph 6, by electronic mail; and

2) That the Secretariat is to include this information notified under paragraph 1 with restricted access in its Contacts database and make it available to the Parties. The contacts database will only include those Observers notified through diplomatic channels, in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.”2

In accordance with this Decision, the notification made through the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty is in addition to the notification to be made by the Consultative Parties through diplomatic channels. Similarly, the provision indicates that the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty shall only publish the list of Observers that were previously notified by the Consultative Parties through diplomatic channels.   

What happens in practice

There has been a recent tendency for the Consultative Parties to forego the notification through diplomatic channels when communicating their lists of observers to each of the other Consultative Parties; instead, they have been using the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty as the sole information instrument. It is clear that this practice has proven to be faster and simpler than the traditional communication via note verbale to each of the Consultative Parties. However, this practice does not comply with what is set out in Decision 7 (2013), adopted in Brussels. 

Similarly, when carrying out the publication in compliance with the regulation, the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty has no way to verify if the notifications by diplomatic channels were previously made by the Consultative Parties. In practice, this could also mean that Decision 7 (2013) is not complied with. 


Recommendation
With the aim of standardising this practice, the Parties are invited to consider the possibility of adopting a Decision at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XLII which would contain a new modality for providing the notification of the list of observers to the Consultative Parties; this modality would make the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty the only instrument for information receipt and dissemination, through which the Consultative Parties would notify or be notified of the lists of observers designated to carry out inspections under the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection.
To facilitate discussion, the draft text of the possible Decision is proposed below:

Decision X (2019)
Notification by the Consultative Parties of the list of Observers under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty  through the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty.
The Representatives,
Bearing in mind that since the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty and the subsequent creation of the Secretariat, new and more efficient ways of sending and exchanging information have been developed, such as the circulars that the Secretariat sends to the Parties via electronic mail; 
Considering that the preservation and distribution of information constitutes one of the principal functions of the Secretariat;
Recalling the provisions of Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, as well as Article 2.2.c of Measure 1 (2003);
Decide:
1) That the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties shall inform the other Consultative Parties, through the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, of the designation of Observers to carry out inspections in conformity with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, as well as of the date of designation and termination of said functions. 
2) That as communication through the Secretariat is considered to be a suitable and adequate means, there is no longer any obligation to communicate this information to each of the Parties via the traditional diplomatic channels; 
3) That the Consultative Parties shall meet the obligation of notification through a note directed to the Secretariat;
4) That, once such information has been received, the Secretariat shall notify all of the Consultative Parties of the designation of Observers for carrying out inspections, via a circular sent through electronic mail; 
5) That the Secretariat shall include said information, with restricted access, in its contacts database and make it available to the Parties; and
6) That Decision 7 (2013) be revoked.
