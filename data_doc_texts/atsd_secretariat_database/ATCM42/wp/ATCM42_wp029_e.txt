Review of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula, 136 Clark Peninsula, 143 Marine Plain, 160 Frazier Island and 162 Mawson’s Huts
Working Paper submitted by Australia 
Summary
In accordance with Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, Australia has undertaken five-yearly reviews of the management plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula, 136 Clark Peninsula, 143 Marine Plain, 160 Frazier Islands and 162 Mawson’s Huts. The reviews were conducted in accordance with Annex V and with reference to the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (the Guide) appended to Resolution 2 (2011). This paper briefly describes the Areas and the reviews conducted. The reviews concluded that the management plans remain relevant for protecting the values for which the areas were designated, and that revisions to the management plans are not required at this time.
Background
ASPA 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land
North-East Bailey Peninsula (66°16’59.9"S, 110°31’59.9"E) is located approximately 200 m east of Australia’s Casey research station, in the Windmill Islands region of the Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. The ASPA covers an area of approximately 0.28 km2. It was designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 16 under Recommendation XIII-8 (1985), after a proposal by Australia. In accordance with Decision 1 (2002) the site was re-designated and renumbered as ASPA 135.  Revised management plans for the Area were adopted under Measure 2 (2003), Measure 8 (2008) and Measure 6 (2013). The ASPA is primarily designated as a scientific reference site which since the early 1980s has supported a range of studies into the diverse assemblage of vegetation found in the area. The close proximity of the Area to Casey research station allows ease of access for field research but also creates the potential for disturbance of study sites.
ASPA 136 Clark Peninsula, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica
Clark Peninsula (66°15’S, 110°36"E) is located approximately 5km north-west of Australia’s Casey station, on the Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. The ASPA covers an area of approximately 9.4 km2. It was designated as SSSI 17 under Recommendation XIII-8 (1985), after a proposal by Australia.  In accordance with Decision 1 (2002) the site was re-designated and renumbered as ASPA 136.  Revised management plans for the Area were adopted under Measure 1 (2006), Measure 7 (2009) and Measure 5 (2014). The ASPA is primarily designated to protect the largely undisturbed terrestrial ecosystem, which possesses one of the most extensive Antarctic flora communities outside of the Antarctic Peninsula, and significant breeding populations of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki).
ASPA 143 Marine Plain, Mule Peninsula, Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land
Marine Plain is located approximately 10 km south-east of Australia’s Davis research station in the Vestfold Hills (68°37'50.2" S, 78°07'55.2" E). The ASPA covers an area of 23.4 km2 and opens into an arm of Crooked Fjord on the southern side of Mule Peninsula, the southernmost of the three major peninsulas that comprise the Vestfold Hills. The Area was originally designated as SSSI 25 under Recommendation XIV-5 (1987), after a proposal by Australia. In accordance with Decision 2 (2002) the site was re-designated and renumbered as ASPA 143. Revised management plans for the area were adopted under Measure 2 (2003) and Measure 9 (2013). The Area is representative of a major Antarctic terrestrial ice-free ecosystem and is primarily designated to protect outstanding fossil fauna and rare geological features. It is of exceptional scientific interest because of its relevance to the palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic record of Antarctica.  
ASPA 160 Frazier Islands, Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica
The Frazier Islands (66°14’S, 110°10’E) consists of a group of three small islands located approximately 16 km offshore from Australia’s Casey research station, in East Antarctica. The ASPA covers an area of approximately 0.6 km2. The Area was designated as an ASPA under Measure 2 (2003) for the sanctuary of breeding populations of southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus). Revised management plans for the Area were adopted under Measure 13 (2008) and Measure 14 (2013). The islands support the largest of only four known breeding colonies of southern giant petrels on continental Antarctica. Continued strict protection of the Frazier Islands southern giant petrel breeding colonies is warranted as protection and monitoring of southern giant petrels at the Frazier Islands contributes to the development of appropriate regional and global conservation strategies for the species and provides information for comparisons with populations elsewhere.
ASPA 162 Mawson’s Huts, Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land, East Antarctica
Mawson’s Huts is located at Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay (67°00'31" S, 142°40'43" E). Commonwealth Bay is the location of four timber huts, known as ‘Mawson’s Huts’ which served as the base of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE) of 1911-14 organised and led by Dr (later Sir) Douglas Mawson. An important symbol of the ‘heroic age’ of Antarctic exploration (1895-1917), Cape Denison is one of only six hut sites remaining from this period. The Area was originally designated under Measure 2 (2004) as ASPA 162, to protect the important historical, technical, architectural and aesthetic value of the four AAE huts. The ASPA was originally embedded within Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) 3 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land, designated under Measure 1 (2004). Under Measure 9 (2014) ASMA 3 was de-designated and the boundary of ASPA 162 was expanded to coincide with the previous ASMA boundary, to provide additional protection for the historic landscape and artefact scatters at Cape Denison, and to simplify the management arrangements for the site. The management plan for the Area was revised accordingly. The ASPA covers an area of approximately 1.1 km2, and is primarily designated to protect Mawson’s Huts and the associated landscape which has considerable historic, archaeological, technical, social and aesthetic values. The ASPA contains the site designated under Measure 3 (2004) as Historic Site and Monument No. 77 Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, George V Land. Cape Denison is subject to a relatively low level of human activity. The ASPA receives occasional visits during summer months by small conservation teams, commercial tour groups and scientists from the French Antarctic program. The Visitor Site Guidelines for Mawson’s Huts and Cape Denison were adopted under Resolution 4 (2011).

Review of management plans
The review of each management plan involved a comprehensive literature review and consultation with scientific, technical and management personnel permitted to enter or otherwise familiar with the Areas.
ASPA 135, ASPA 143 and ASPA 160
The management plans for ASPAs 135, 143 and 160 were due for five-yearly review in 2018, and Australia undertook reviews of each plan during 2017/18. Due to the reduced duration and agenda of CEP XXI (2018), and the necessary focus of that meeting on urgent priority matters, the results of the reviews were presented in an Information Paper (IP35). Noting that ASPAs are the shared responsibility of all Parties, Australia is resubmitting the outcomes of the reviews for the Committee’s consideration:
    • ASPA 135 North-East Bailey Peninsula had been frequently visited in the preceding five years to allow the maintenance of essential communications infrastructure for Casey research station, and to continue an ongoing program of removal of abandoned and obsolete infrastructure from within the ASPA, in accordance with the provisions of the management plan.
    • ASPA 143 Marine Plain had been infrequently visited in the preceding five years. A management visit was conducted in the 2017/18 season to provide recommendations on the management of helicopter access to the area, and to assess the status of two sensitive fossil sites. The existing protective geotextile covering over one fossil site was assessed and found to be in good condition, and a new geotextile covering was placed over the second site. A report commissioned from geological experts will inform a future review of arrangements for access to the Area, with a view to minimising risks to the brittle surface crust in Marine Plain, and for the long-term in situ or ex situ protection of the unique fossils within the area.
    • ASPA 160 Frazier Islands had also been infrequently visited in the preceding five years, consistent with the provisions of the management plan intended to minimise disturbance to the southern giant petrel colony. Data gained from the automatic cameras in the area has been used to accurately determine the breeding chronology of the colony, which will inform the planning of future censuses to ensure the robustness of population estimates.
On the basis of the reviews conducting during 2017/18, Australia concluded that the existing management provisions for ASPA 135, ASPA 143 and ASPA 160 remained relevant for ensuring the protection of the values for which the Areas were designated. Australia has subsequently reconsidered each of the management plans, and confirmed that no new information was obtained during 2018/19 that would warrant changes to the management arrangements for these Areas.  
ASPA 136 and ASPA 162
ASPA 136 Clark Peninsula has been regularly visited in the last five years, to allow servicing and downloading images from automated cameras, photographic census, ground survey and scientific research on penguins. A management visit was conducted in the 2018/19 season, consistent with the objectives of the management plan. The censuses indicate that the populations of Adelie penguins at Whitney Point and Blakeney Point within the Area have been stable between recent surveys in 2010/11 and 2016/17, with current populations of approximately 11,000 occupied nests and 4,000 occupied nests, respectively
ASPA 162 Mawson’s Huts has been infrequently visited in the last five years, including due to sea ice conditions which hindered access to the site. A heritage carpenter from the Mawson’s Huts Foundation visited during the 2018/19 season to assess the condition of the huts. Based on observations made during this visit, the Main Hut and Workshop, Magnetograph House and Absolute Magnetic Hut remain in good condition, however some cladding boards and over-battens require refixing. Transit Hut remains the most vulnerable of all the heritage structures at Cape Denison. Further assessment is required to inform an appropriate conservation approach, consistent with the provisions of the ASPA management plan. Australia consulted with France concerning the outcomes of the review.
On the basis of these reviews, Australia considers that the existing management provisions for ASPAs 136 and 162 remain relevant to ensuring the protection of the values for which the Areas were designated. 
Recommendations
Australia recommends that the CEP:
    • notes that Australia conducted five-yearly reviews of the management plans for ASPAs 135, 136, 143, 160 and 162, in accordance with Article 6.3 of Annex V to the Protocol, and concluded that no updates to the management plans are required; and 
    • agrees that the management plans will continue for a further five-year period, or until new information is obtained that warrants an earlier review.
