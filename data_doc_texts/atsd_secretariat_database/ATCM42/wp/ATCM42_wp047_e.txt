Proposal for a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Inexpressible Island and Seaview Bay, Ross Sea

Working Paper submitted by China, Italy and Republic of Korea
Summary
China, Italy and the Republic of Korea jointly propose the designation of a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Inexpressible Island and Seaview Bay, Ross Sea. The co-authors have prepared the draft ASPA Management Plan and maps annexed to this paper, in accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol and the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (Resolution 2 (2011) for consideration by the CEP.

1. Introduction
Inexpressible Island and Seaview Bay is located in Terra Nova Bay, Victoria Land, Western Ross Sea at 74° 54.2' S, 143° 43.5' E. The proposed area is distinctive and the primary reasons for its designation as an ASPA are that it hosts one of the oldest Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and an important breeding site of South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki). Such a peculiar ecosystem is related to the adjacent Terra Nova Bay polynya and allows comparison with other nearby sites with different sea ice dynamics along the year. Moreover, in the proposed area, several lakes are influenced by guano nutrient inputs from birds, while others are not impacted.

The first documented record of an Adélie penguin breeding group in the Area was in 1963, and continuous monitoring has been carried out from the 1980s to the present, with so far one of the earliest statistical record of the Adélie penguin in the Ross Sea region. The active penguin colony in the Area has had continuous occupation for the past ~7,000 year, which is the longest existing Adélie penguin colony in the Ross Sea region. The proposed area includes crucial penguins’ foraging access area to Terra Nova Bay polynya.

The proposed area is listed as an important bird area (IBA178) by Bird Life International and is described as Domain S (McMurdo-South Victoria Land geologic) based on the Environmental Domains Analysis for the Antarctic continent. Moreover, the proposed area sits within Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Region (ACBR) 8 Northern Victoria Land. 

China, Italy and Korea are jointly proposing the designation of an ASPA in the proposed area for long-term special protection because of the outstanding scientific and ecological values and its potential vulnerability to disturbance from scientific, logistic and tourist activities. 

2. Values in need of special protection
The exceptional scientific and ecological values of the Area are based on the following:
    • The Adélie penguin colony of Inexpressible Island is one of the longest monitored Adélie penguin population in Ross Sea region since 1963 and lasted in the past 30 years. Long-term population monitoring will provide support for studying the dynamics of breeding penguin populations, and the relationship between populations and climate change.
    • It is the longest continuous occupation breeding colony of Adélie penguin in Ross Sea area, and the subfossil bone samples that retain DNA and guano in recent 7,000 years of the Adélie penguin have been cryopreserved in the area. Study on the remains would provide a rich and unique sample library for studying the historical dynamics, climate change and molecular evolution on the geologic scale.
    • The Inexpressible Island penguin’s population may act as a source for neighboring subpopulations of Adélie penguin colonies in Edmonson Point and Adélie Cove.
    • South Polar Skua nests are distributed around Adélie penguin colony of the proposed area, and the Skuas have a low breeding success in the Terra Nova Bay area in comparison with other areas. Long-term monitoring and research on the reproductive population dynamics, ecology and interspecific relationships of the top trophic level omnivorous South Polar Skua not only supports the conservation of the species, but also helps to reveal the response of lower trophic levels to climate change.
    • The Adélie penguin colony located in a high-quality habitat nearby the polynya. The easier foraging access between breeding colonies and sea, could have a positive impact on the feeding efficiency and diet composition of Adélie penguins thus explaining the possible differences in the breeding success rate, and allowing comparison studies with other areas of the Ross Sea.
    • The presence of the polynya offers opportunity to study the undisturbed marine food-web structure and functioning under ice free conditions allowing comparisons with the nearby areas where sea ice coverage is more persistent. This proposed area is a reference site concerning studies on the marine food-web structure and the effect of sea ice dynamics on the ecosystem.
    • Several fresh-water lakes within the penguin breeding area are present and are influenced by guano input and sea spray, which determine a particular physiochemical and trophic status with higher levels of nutrients. Highly influenced and some not influenced lakes by guano and sprayed sea water would provide references for the comparative limnetic ecological study.
    • The beaches of Inexpressible Island have risen by 30 m in the Holocene, and there are the best-preserved ocean and glacial landforms in Terra Nova Bay. The unique geomorphological feature is of great scientific value for studying geological and glacial changes, the evolution of penguin distribution patterns, and Holocene climate change.

3. Boundary proposal
The proposed area is located in the eastern central part of Inexpressible Island, including the Seaview Bay and the northern part of the South Bay. The total area of the proposed ASPA is 3.31 km2, of which 2.32 km2 is terrestrial and 0.99 km2 is marine area. The total extent of the borders is 7.86 km. Eastwards, the boundary of the ASPA is mainly marine, and includes the foraging access routes that penguins use intensively to access the sea. Westwards, the boundary borders the current South Polar skua nesting area and the historical distribution area of the Adélie penguin, including freshwater lakes far away from the birds’ nests. 

4. Procedures so far undertaken
At CEP XXI Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, China introduced WP 30 Prior assessment of a Proposed Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) on the Inexpressible Island. The Committee agreed that due to the combination of scientific, environmental and historic values present, and the increasing human activities, the area merited to be designated as an ASPA. Italy expressed its interest in joining China as a co-proponent of the ASPA. The Committee encouraged interested Members and Observers to work with China during the intersessional period to develop a draft management plan for submission at CEP XXII. 
As a follow-up to the conclusion at CEP XXI Meeting, China and Italy decided that a good opportunity to exchange views on the subject would be through the organization of international workshops on the proposed ASPA. The first workshop was held on October 11-12, 2018 in Xiamen, China and saw the participation of Italy, Korea and New Zealand. A first draft management plan was circulated by China to participants. The workshop agreed on some important issues such as the boundary of the ASPA and values to be protected. It was decided that China, Italy and Korea would be the co-proponents of the ASPA.
The second international workshop on the proposed ASPA was held in Rome, Italy on April 9-10, 2019. China, Korea, New Zealand and United States participated the workshop, Germany provided opinions on the draft management plan. During the workshop a detailed discussion on the revised draft management plan prepared by the co-proponents took place. The final version is attached to this WP.  Although fishing is not being carried out within the marine area of the proposed ASPA, the co-proponents decided to forward the draft management plan for consideration by CCAMLR. According to the procedure of CCAMLR, the proposal needs to be evaluated first by the Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM).  Italy will present it to the WG-EMM-19 on behalf of the co-proponents for discussion.

5. Recommendation
The draft management plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area at Inexpressible Island and Seaview Bay, is submitted to the CEP for its consideration.  China, Italy and Korea recommend that the CEP refer the draft Management Plan to the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) during the intersessional period of 2019-2020.
