Report of the intersessional open-ended contact group established to consider the draft CEE for the “Continuation and Modernization of McMurdo Station Area Activities”
Working Paper submitted by the Republic of Korea 
Summary
An intersessional open-ended contact group (ICG) was established in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs to consider United States’ draft comprehensive environmental evaluation (CEE) for “Continuation and Modernization of McMurdo Station Area Activities”. On the basis of comments provided by participants, the ICG advises the CEP that the draft CEE is generally clear, well structured, and well presented, but noted a few inconsistencies between sections of the draft CEE.  Participants agreed that the draft CEE generally and broadly conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection, however, some participants recommended reconsideration of the scope of the proposed activity and expressed the view that additional information would be required on a number of aspects for the final CEE to fully conform to the requirements of Article 3 of the Protocol. The draft CEE identifies the majority of the impacts that are likely to be associated with the activity, but ICG participants have suggested including some additional potential impacts including cumulative impacts and on mitigation measures. The ICG further advises that the conclusion that impacts of some activities within the project will have a more than minor or transitory impact is broadly supported by the information contained within the draft CEE. The ICG suggests that if the United States decides to proceed with the proposed activity, there are some aspects for which the inclusion of additional information could strengthen the final CEE.
    1. Background
On 14 February 2019 the United States notified the CEP Chair of the availability of the draft CEE for “Continuation and Modernization of McMurdo Station Area Activities”. The draft CEE has been prepared by National Science Foundation (NSF). The full document can be downloaded from the CEP Workspace on the website of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty1 as descried in CEP Circular 4/CEP XXII. The contact point for the draft CEE is Dr. Polly A. Penhale (CEE.comments@nsf.gov).
In accordance with the Procedures for intersessional consideration of Draft CEEs (Appendix 3 to the CEP XX Final Report) the CEP Chair issued:
    • CEP Circular 4/CEP XXII (14 February 2019), which;
    • advised contact points of the availability of the draft CEE;
    • advised of the need to establish an open-ended intersessional contact group (ICG) to review the draft CEE;
    • proposed that Dr. Ji Hee Kim (Republic of Korea) convene the ICG;
    • proposed terms of reference for the ICG; and
    • invited CEP members to comment on the proposed convener and/or terms of reference.
    • CEP Circular 5/CEP XXII (04 March 2019), which noted that no comments had been received on the proposed convener or terms of reference.

Terms of reference
The ICG addressed the following four generic terms of reference, drawn from the Procedures for intersessional consideration of draft CEEs as adopted by CEP XX2:
    • the extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol;
    • whether the CEE: i) has identified all the environmental impacts of the proposed activity; and ii) suggests appropriate methods of mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts;
    • whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document; and
    • the clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE.
The Revised Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (Annex of Resolution 1, 2016), provide relevant guidance to reviewers as well as authors on the presentation of CEEs.
Method of operation
All ICG correspondence has been made available to CEP members and observers via the CEP Discussion Forum. The English language version of the full draft CEE was posted on the Forum, together with four official language versions of the Non-Technical Summary and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (Resolution 1, 2016).
ICG participants were reminded by the CEP Chair and the ICG convener of the CEP’s agreement that the Procedures for intersessional consideration of draft CEEs do not detract from the right of any Party to the Protocol to raise an issue on a draft CEE at meetings of the CEP or at an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM).
The ICG commenced with an initial comment period from 04 March to 15 April 2019. The convener circulated a draft ICG report for comment on 22 April. In this Working Paper the final comments submitted by CEP members and Observers have been addressed to the convener’s best ability.
    2. Summary of comments received from ICG participants
Comments were submitted to the ICG by nine CEP Members (Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Romania, and the United Kingdom) and one Observer (ASOC).
The following sections summarizes overarching comments and observations, as well as matters of principles, raised by one or more ICG members during the review period.
The detailed comments submitted by ICG members using tabular comment sheet provide important information and should be considered of interest to the proponent in their effort to finalize the CEE. No effort has been made to compile these comments into a single document on the following basis:
    • Substantive (non-technical) issues that members have raised have been included in the summary of the Working Paper;
    • Compiling similar comments, may lead to loss of nuances; and
    • Proponents are more likely to find use in the individual comments rather than the compiled comments in their further work.
The complete set of comments from ICG participants are available in full from the CEP Discussion Forum.
    1. ToR 1: The extent to which the CEE conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol
ICG participants considered that the draft CEE generally and broadly conforms to the formal requirements of Article 3 of Annex I of the Environmental Protocol. However, some participants recommended reconsidering the scope of the proposed activity and expressed the view that additional information would be required on a number of aspects for the final CEE to fully conform to the requirements of Article 3 of the Protocol.
Participants commented favourably on the proposal to continue the long-standing and significant USAP research activities in the McMurdo station area, and the anticipated scientific operation, safety and environmental benefits of the proposed activity. Nevertheless the following points provide a usuful summary of the participants’ suggestions regarding matters that could be addressed in a final CEE: 
    • Further defined and expanded statement of the scope of the CEE and interdependencies between the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) projects and McMurdo Master Plan projects;
    • Detailed information on the proposed activity and description of the initial environmental reference state and possible alternatives;
    • Further information on the proposed construction projects including layout, design, materials, prefabricated elements, and schedule for the AIMS and McMurdo Master Plan projects;
    • Further details regarding the predicted direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts; 
    • Consideration of the effects of the proposed activity on not only the scientific operations but also other existing uses and values;
    • Summaries of key provisions of separate or complementary referred USAP procedures and EIAs with accessible links as methods and source of data used in the draft CEE;
    • The present uncertainties in the designs and locations of McMurdo Master Plan projects.
Participants did identify some aspects for which additional information or clarification could usefully be provided in the final CEE to enhance its robustness, if the proponent decides to proceed with the proposed activity. A summary of these comments are provided in the following, as per the requirement of Annex I, Art. 3.2. For comments related to Annex I, Art. 3.2 (c-e and g-h), see discussion under ToR 2.
Description of the proposed activity (Annex I, Article 3.2 (a)): The ICG participants presented similar questions and comments in nature and noted that the proponent could consider inter alia:
    • Explanation of how the AIMS project and the McMurdo Master Plan fit together and will influence or include the support toward ongoing USAP science and operational activities;
    • Separation of EIA or EIAs for implementing McMurdo Master plan;
    • Clarification of  the extent of the area and inclusion of a clear statement of scope for the proposed activity;
    • A proposed timeline of the activities;
    • Further details of the reasons why the current facilities are not considered satisfying and more information regarding the way life expectancy of the current facilities and energy efficiency standards;
    • How the Lodging # 1 building would increase energy efficiency and reduce maintenance requirements compared to the existing housing it would replace;
    • Including the improvement of grey water management to the modernization projects to allow a diminution of the energy cost of the station, and improve its environmental performance;
    • Providing details of locations of laydown area and new buildings planned in proposed activity;
    • Details of construction materials, building form and foundations, prefabricated facilities outside Antarctica;
    • Further information on the planned alternative energy technology system, including an estimate of the extent to which alternative energy sources may offset power generation by diesel generators;
    • Bringing forward the schedule for the construction of the new waste processing facility to assist with the handling of wastes generated during the proposed modernization activities;
Possible alternatives to the activity (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (a)): Some participants commented on this aspect. They noted that a number of other alternatives were considered but not carried forward, and only a limited information regarding these other alternatives were provided in the draft CEE. They recommended providing a more detailed summary of the alternatives considered (e.g. locations, layouts, designs, materials, construction techniques, technologies, timing and scale) and relative environmental impacts.
Description of the initial environment (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (b)): ICG participants noted that the CEE would benefit from:
    • Providing the reference to the maximum and minimum latitude and longitude, and images and diagrams of the key areas of operations to understand the description of the environment and potential impacts from the proposed activity;
    • Focusing the affected areas by the construction activity and reducing or deleting some of the initial environmental state descriptions for those areas in Chapter 4 described as not affected. (e.g. section 4.3 to 4.6);
    • Further detailed description of the McMurdo Station area (including Winter Quarters Bay) that covers the identified station footprint of 2.5 km2 including some information and/or maps showing the measured levels of contamination;
    • Including the human-built environment (section 2.2.3 could possibly be relocated);
    • Inclusion of plans and figures, maps showing the location of the ecological resources (e.g. distribution maps for vegetation, ice-free ground, seal haul out areas, nesting skuas, ASPAs, HSMs, and IBA) with the area of construction activities;
    • Providing a summary of the description of the environment in the McMurdo Dry Valley region, with a drawing on the cited IEE for the continuation of the LTER program including a description of current impacts;
    • Incorporating results from monitoring programme undertaken at the McMurdo Station area between 1999 and 2012 to better describe the area;
    • Including new studies to allow a more accurate documentation of changes in organism communities over time; 
Consideration of cumulative impacts (Annex I, Article 3.2 (f)): Some participants recommended proponent to provide details regarding cumulative environmental impacts and identify the cumulative impacts in Table 5-2 and 5-3 summarizing the “Impacts of McMurdo Station Modernization (AIMS and McMurdo Master Plan) Activities” and the “Impacts of Continued Operations of McMurdo Area Activities and Facilities”.
Consideration of the effects of the proposed activity on the conduct of scientific research and on other existing uses and values (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (i)): Some participants suggested expanding consideration of the potential impacts to include not only current and future scientific operations undertaken at and near McMurdo Station but also its existing uses and values on other aspects.
Identification of gap of knowledge (Annex 1, Article 3.2 (j)):  A few comments were made by the participants with regard to this aspect, some participants suggested highlighting the present uncertainties in the designs and locations of McMurdo Master Plan project in Chapter 9. Others recommended preparing another EIA after completion of the AIMS projects to reduce the uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding the implementation and potential environmental impacts from the projects under McMurdo Master Plan. 
A non-technical summary of the information provided (Annex I, Article 3.2 (k)): Most participants were satisfied with the non-technical summary provided by the proponent, however some participants suggested redrafting a more general summary or overview of the draft CEE to help clarify the scope of the activities, and highlighting the most significant environmental impacts in the non-technical summary.
    2. ToR 2: Whether the CEE i) has identified all the environmental impacts of the proposed activity and ii) suggests appropriate methods of mitigating (reducing or avoiding) those impacts
(i) Impacts: The ICG participants noted that the draft CEE identifies the key environmental impacts of the proposed activity and provides broad description. However, the CEE provides limited information regarding the associated environmental impacts with the environmental aspects of the proposed McMurdo Station modernization activities and continuing McMurdo area activities. Some participants were concerned with how the scope of the CEE could be potentially confusing to understand, and suggested clarifying and reducing the scope of the CEE even further to identify all the impacts of the proposed activity. Besides, participants raised some issues which would benefit from additional attention when preparing the final CEE:
Methodology and structure
    • The methods and data used to evaluate the potential environmental and operational impacts refer to the existing USAP procedures and EIAs relevant to the proposed activity, however, only limited information is provided. Further details with links to and summaries of key provisions of the procedures and EIAs could strengthen the CEE.
Impacts
    • Table 5-2 contains a well-presented and comprehensive overview of both the environmental aspects and impacts of the proposed activity, but the absence of supporting written descriptions of these potential impacts limits the ability to objectively consider and verify the impact ratings;
    • The environmental impacts of activities at locations supported by the station are not very clear. If they are to remain in scope, then it is suggested that Chapter 5 should directly refer to and include within the impact tables the fixed facilities, mode of logistics and the sensitivity of the different environments where those operations occur away from the station;
    • Some activities planned in the McMurdo Master Plan (2027-2033) may require some future evaluation. Participants acknowledged that it is difficult to assess their impacts due to the time scale and uncertainties, nevertheless further information on their potential impacts is required to discuss the master plan in this CEE;
    • Participants have highlighted a few issues relating to impact of explosives use and excavation during site preparation and drainage improvement, and suggested further consideration could be given to:
    • Providing information on background noise level and the calculation of the ambient noise level at the nearest nesting sites and seal haul out areas with a map. In addition, population size of birds and number of seals hauling-out which should be required to monitor possible negative effect on their populations (e.g. breeding success rate decreasing and displacement) during the construction periods;
    • Providing references to support the statement that 93 decibel is sound noise level at temporary threshold shift (TTS) and threshold level for pinnipeds;
    • Identifying potential impacts associated with the generation of vibration and dust during construction activities;
    • Considering the impact of not only blasting activities but also drilling, excavation or material handling activities to assess overall noise-related disturbance of wildlife comprehensively;
    • Further information should be provided on the location and the schedule of the activity to better plan the different phases of the construction and demolition work, taking into account critical seasonal periods for wildlife;
    • Providing further detailed description including the packing of waste, and precise amount of hazardous waste generated during the current operation and the construction period;
    • The ICG participants noted the increases and changes in quarrying are presented as volumes in the CEE, however, the location(s) and areal extent of the extraction(s) and rock types(s) are not described. Further details should include the fines harvesting locations in a form of a map, as well as related environmental features such as wildlife locations, drainage and snow banks;
    • Considering the option of sourcing fines from already disturbed location within the station area rather than harvesting from intact rock outcrops;
    • Including an assessment of the impacts on the marine environment associated with the use, and periodic construction and release, of the ice pier, and associated mitigation measures;
    • Addressing the risk of introduction of non-native species, and transfer of species between location, and related mitigations in Table 5-3;
    • Some participants noted that the indirect impacts (e.g. dust on the sea ice, sediment runoff to the marine environment) are not discussed in the impact section and cumulative impacts are not identified in Table 5-2;
Mitigation: The ICG participants noted that the CEE suggests appropriate methods of mitigation, reduction or to avoid the impacts of the proposed activity in general. However, the CEE frequently refers to the “established USAP measures and procedures” or a similar regulation that would be implemented to mitigate predicted environmental impacts without a description of the procedure or inclusion of it. The ICG recommended that the proponent includes links to the relevant external measures and procedures, or present sufficient information (e.g. a summary of key provisions) to allow an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the planned arrangements, consistent with the approach recommended in the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Antarctica (Section 3.5). The ICG participants also noted that clarification of some mitigation measures and further information on some topics could be helpful inter alia with regards to:
    • Providing the environmental protection guidelines referred to the CEE as an appendix in the final CEE;
    • Noting that blasting has a number of potential impacts associated with it, there is need to consider:
    • Clarification of the “standard procedures to halt project activities” to avoid noise impacts to wildlife;
    • Consideration of explosions to be carried out as much as possible at a time when the animals are not yet on site or not in critical periods (e.g. incubating period);
    • Whether fresh or salt water would be used for dust control;
    • Further investigation of mitigation measures for blasting and dust control
    • Setting criteria for wind speed and direction, for ceasing dust generating operations could minimize dust generation and impacts on sensitive sites;
    • Further details of prevention and mitigation measures for hazardous wastes release (e.g. asbestos, lead based paint) to the environment;
    • Whether existing sewage treatment capacity is satisfied the amount of sewage increased by more than 30 % during construction phase; 
    • Providing a more comprehensive description of planned prevention, monitoring and response measures for non-native species;
    • Considering recycling and reuse of the treated water, which would reduce the requirements for reverse osmosis; and
    • Providing further detail regarding plans for the removal, management, and presumably replacement of HSM 54.
    • Providing further details regarding the environmental monitoring to be undertaken during and after the proposed activity
    3. Tor 3: Whether the conclusions of the draft CEE are adequately supported by the information contained within the document
ICG participants felt that the conclusion that “some impacts would result in more than a minor or transitory impact”, is broadly supported by the information contained within the draft CEE, and that this level of EIA therefore seems to appropriate for this project. While noting, some suggestions regarding the provision of additional information, participants also considered that the following conclusions presented in the draft CEE were likely to be correct:
    • the potential benefits of the proposed activity are substantial and long lasting (Section 5.7);
    • the proposed activity would result in substantial improvements in the environmental performance of USAP McMurdo Station area activities (Section 10).
    4. Tor 4: The clarity, format and presentation of the draft CEE
The ICG participants agreed that the draft CEE is generally clear, well written and well presented. They felt that the draft CEE is quite concise which may be due to the nature and location of the proposal, involving ongoing activities and/or new activities in already disturbed locations, and are largely subject to applicable existing environmental management procedures. However, to a certain extent, it is also a consequence of the draft CEE relying on information contained in other documents. Participants felt that this approach makes it challenging to gain a clear understanding of the draft CEE. A number of participants recommended the followings for the final CEE:
    • To find a way to illustrate the relationship between the proposed activities that are within the scope of the draft CEE and the associated activities that are addressed under separate or complementary EIAs; 
    • To summarise the key points from separate documents cited in the draft CEE that contain information relevant to describing the proposed activities and their environmental management.
    • To support enhanced understanding of the spatial context for proposed activities, a final CEE could contain additional and higher quality maps, figures or aerial photos, for example including:
        ◦ planned/anticipated locations for McMurdo Master Plan project activities and topography (Section 3.3);
        ◦ locations of environmental features relative to proposed activities (Sections 4.3 to 4.6); 
        ◦ location of known contaminated sites; and
        ◦ harvest areas for fill and fines generation and harvesting (page 3-6)
    • To note the sensitivities of the sites within the locations supported by the station, particularly ice-free areas and location of wildlife, including more details regarding this activity would be useful to include within the CEE.
Note that further valuable comments relating to the format and the structure of the document provided by the ICG participants are available on the CEP Discussion forum. The proponent is encouraged to use these detailed comments when finalizing the CEE.
    3. Conclusions
The ICG established to review the draft CEE prepared by the United States for the “Continuation and Modernization of McMurdo Station Area Activities”, in accordance with the Procedures for intersessional CEP consideration of draft CEEs, advises the CEP that:
    1) The draft CEE generally and broadly conforms to the requirements of Article 3 of Annex I to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. However, some participants recommended reconsideration of the scope of the proposed activity and expressed the view that additional information would be required on a number of aspects for the final CEE to fully conform to the requirements of Article 3 of the Protocol.
    2) If the United States decides to proceed with the proposed activity, there are some aspects for which additional information or clarification could be provided in the final CEE to enhance its comprehensiveness, as outlined in this ICG report. In particular, the Committee’s attention is drawn to the suggestions that some further consideration could be provided regarding:
    • To clarify the scope of the CEE to identify all the impacts of the proposed activity;
    • The relationship between the proposed activities that are within the scope of the draft CEE and the associated activities that are addressed under separate/complementary EIAs;
    • To summarise the key points from separate documents cited in the draft CEE that contain information relevant to describing the proposed activities and their environmental management plan;
    • Full range of description, impacts, and mitigation measures of the proposed McMurdo Station modernization activities (AIMS and McMurdo Master Plan) and continuing McMurdo area activities.
The United States is furthermore encouraged to consider the detailed comments provided by ICG participants as well as the summary of the main issues as put forward in the ICG report.  
    3) The information provided in the draft CEE broadly supports the conclusion that the impacts of some activities within the project will have a more than minor or transitory impact”, and that this level of EIA is appropriate for this project. 
The draft CEE is generally clear, well written and well presented, although suggestions were made to clarify and further strengthen the document.
