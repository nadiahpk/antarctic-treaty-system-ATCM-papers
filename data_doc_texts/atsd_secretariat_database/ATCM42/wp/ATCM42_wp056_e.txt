Updated Management Plan and maps for Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 4 Deception Island








Updated Management Plan and maps for 
Antarctic Specially Managed Area No 4 Deception Island
Working Paper submitted by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and United States (in conjunction with ASOC and IAATO)
Summary

The Deception Island Management Group (DIMG)1 has conducted its second five-yearly review of the Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Managed Area No. 4, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. DIMG recommends the CEP approves the attached revised Management Plan for this Area. 

Background

Deception Island (latitude 62°57’S, longitude 60°38’W), South Shetland Islands, is a unique Antarctic island with important natural, scientific, historic, educational and aesthetic values. The need to conserve and protect these unique and outstanding values, whilst at the same time managing the variety of competing demands placed upon them, led to the designation of Deception Island as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area under Measure 3 (2005) (ASMA No. 4: Deception Island, South Shetland Islands). The Managed Plan was updated under Measure 10 (2012) following its first five-year review.

Formal review of the ASMA No. 4 Management Plan was initiated in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol, and this work has been on going.  DIMG has met annually in the margins of the ATCM and last submitted an Information Paper reporting on matters discussed in 2017, Information Paper IP073 (ATCM XL, Beijing, 2017). 

Summary of amendments to the management plan for ASMA No. 4
Several revisions and updates to the Management Plan, annexes and maps have been made. The Management Group considered that the Management Plan remained largely appropriate, and any revisions made are largely refinements rather than substantive changes. The boundary of the ASMA remains unchanged.  The principal changes can be summarised as follows:

    • There have been a number of updates throughout the Management Plan elaborating on procedures for volcanic monitoring, the volcanic alert system and the history of volcanic activity on the island. This includes the availability of a new map of the volcanic surveillance system. Appendix 6 ‘Alert Scheme and Escape Strategy for volcanic eruptions on Deception Island’ has also been updated.
    • Additional scientific detail has been added regarding the invertebrates present on the island.
    • The former Appendix 11 relating to “Practical Biosecurity Measures” has been deleted. Instead, additional detail relating to biosecurity has been added to the Management Plan itself in Section 9 viii. This is not intended to be seen a reduction in the importance of biosecurity in relation to the island, which remains highly susceptible to non-native species introductions, but as an acknowledgement of the wider suite of general information now available in relation to non-native species within the Treaty system. 
    • At last year’s ATCM it was agreed in the Site Guidelines for Whalers Bay to prohibit the walk between Whalers Bay and Baily Head for non-scientific purposes. This prohibition is now incorporated into the Management Plan.
    • The plan now clarifies that the use of motorised vehicles and overnight camping on the island is prohibited for non-scientific purposes. 
    • The plan previously suggested the relocation of dispersed historic material to its relevant location. This advice is now altered to avoid material being moved erroneously. Any material discovered seemingly out of context should be secured and further assessed by experienced personnel.
    • The reporting requirement detailed in Section 10 has been edited to remove the now defunct reporting function; it is not practical to report to all visits to the Deception Islands Management Group. Nevertheless, the group remains keen to receive regular reporting of any incidents that have occurred within the Area.
    • Appendices 1 and 2 are the Management Plans for two ASPAs within the Area. The Management Plan for ASPA 140 was revised in 2018, while the Management Plan for APSA 145 is currently under review by Chile and is due to be presented to the SGMP for consideration.
    • Appendices 3 – 5 have had minor amendments as part of this process. 
    • Appendix 6 – the historical context and volcanic activity have been updated. Minor changes have been done in the alert system. A review about the escape strategy in case of a volcanic eruption has been carried out. A new item about “general volcanic emergency kit” has been included and an escape route has been erased.
    • Appendices 7 - 10 are the visitor site guidelines for Telefon Bay (updated 2018), Whalers Bay (updated 2018), Baily Head (updated 2013), Pendulum Cove (updated 2018).

More specific revisions to the Management Plan text are summarised in Appendix 1, where the relevant sections have been identified.  The full text of the revised Management Plan and Appendices 1 – 10 that form part of the Management Plan are attached.
