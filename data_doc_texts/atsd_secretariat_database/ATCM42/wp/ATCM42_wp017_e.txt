SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica









SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica
A Working Paper submitted by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
Summary
Recognizing the broad and extensive consultation that has been undertaken in the development of SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica (available at Attachment A) SCAR recommends that the CEP considers the Code of Conduct for dissemination and encouragement of adoption when planning and undertaking work that involves animals in Antarctica.
Introduction
SCAR has produced several non-mandatory Codes of Conduct to help guide scientific practices within the Treaty area, including:
    • SCAR’s Environmental Code of Conduct for Terrestrial Scientific Field Research in Antarctica (ATCM XXXII IP 04, ATCM XL WP 018), which provides guidance on practical measures to minimize impacts by scientists undertaking fieldwork in terrestrial environments;
    • SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals in Scientific Research (ATCM XXXIV IP 053), which provides guiding principles for research involving vertebrate animals in Antarctica; 
    • SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Exploration and Research of Subglacial Aquatic Environments (ATCM XXXIV IP 033, ATCM XL WP 017), which provides guidelines for operations and scientific activities in pristine subglacial environments; and
    • The SCAR Code of Conduct for Activity within Terrestrial Geothermal Environments in Antarctica (ATCM XXXIX WP 023), which highlights the scientific value of Antarctic terrestrial geothermal areas, and provides guidance for activities in these areas.
At ATCM XXXIX, the CEP requested that SCAR consider bringing previous Codes of Conduct back to future CEP meetings for further consideration and endorsement. The request recognised the utility of the SCAR Codes of Conduct, in particular that their value would be increased by their translation into the four official Treaty languages.
At ATCM XXXIX, ATCM XL, and ATCM XLI, the CEP expressed strong support for the SCAR Code of Conduct for Activity within Terrestrial Geothermal Environments in Antarctica, SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Exploration and Research of Subglacial Aquatic Environments, and SCAR’s Environmental Code of Conduct for Terrestrial Scientific Field Research in Antarctica, respectively, endorsing them by means of a Resolution. 
Development and review of SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica
Comprehensive and broad consultation has occurred through the preparation and development of this Code of Conduct (CoC), and is summarised below:
    • This CoC was developed in recognition that humans have a moral obligation to respect all animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for pain and suffering.
    • This CoC was originally prepared and then reviewed by the SCAR community in 2010/11 and presented to the Committee during CEP XXIV in 2011 (ATCM XXXIV IP 053).
    • Following the request of the Committee at CEP XIX in 2016, a further review of the Code of Conduct was coordinated by SCAR during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 intersessional periods. Feedback was obtained from relevant experts, members of the Standing Committee on the Antarctic Treaty System (SCATS), the SCAR Expert Group on Birds and Marine Mammals (EG-BAMM), representatives of the Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (SC-CAMLR) and the Council Of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP).
The revision was substantial, and the content has been revised and expanded to include all animals (for which guiding information is available) and the research activities relevant to them by drawing on both Antarctic and global knowledge regarding the minimisation of animal suffering. Other specific edits, additions and improvements include:
    • typographical errors were rectified;
    • grammar was edited for consistency;
    • terminology was updated to reflect contemporary usage; and
    • repetition was removed.
The resulting SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica is found at Attachment A to this Working Paper.  The Code of Conduct will replace the existing Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals in Scientific Research and be made available, alongside other existing SCAR Codes of Conduct, on the SCAR website: http://www.scar.org/codes-of-conduct.  It is anticipated that the Code of Conduct will be updated and refined as new scientific results emerge and reports on activities become available.
Recommendations
SCAR recommends that the CEP:
    1) recognizes that broad and extensive consultation has been undertaken in the review and revision of this non-mandatory Code of Conduct, including with policy makers, environmental managers and scientific experts;
    2) recognises that this Code of Conduct replaces the existing SCAR Code of Conduct for Use of Animals for Scientific Research;  and
    3) considers SCAR’s Code of Conduct for the Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes in Antarctica (Attachment A) for dissemination and encouragement of adoption when planning and undertaking work that involves the use of animals in Antarctica.
