Subsidiary Group on Management Plans 
Report of activities during the intersessional period 2018-2019
Working Paper submitted by Argentina on behalf of the SGMP
Summary
For the intersessional period 2018/2019, the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans (SGMP) was commissioned to work under the Terms of Reference (ToR) agreed by CEP XIII and in relation to the tasks incorporated in the Work Plan of the Group, by CEP XXI. In accordance with ToRs 1 to 3, while no new plans were sent to the SGMP, the management plans pending from the previous intersessional period would be reviewed by the SGMP. In accordance with Terms of Reference 4 to 5, the SGMP worked on improvements to the Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) designation and developed a flowchart. This document includes information on the status of the plans with pending review and on the other tasks assigned to the Group. It also lists the tasks for the next intersessional period, which the Committee may wish to enhance.
    1. Tasks agreed by CEP XXI for the work of the SGMP during the intersessional period
As is indicated in the CEP XXI Final Report (paragraph 106) the Committee agreed to adopt the following work plan for 2018/19:

The terms of reference indicated in the work plan, and under which the SGMP worked, are those adopted by CEP XIII and are included as Annex I.
    2. Task under Terms of Reference 1 to 3.
        a. Review of Management Plans under Tors 1 and 3. Current situation.
The SGMP was commissioned to give further advice and complete the review process of four of the five Management Plans, initiated in 2014, once the proponent (Chile) provided the updated versions of those management plans. Management plans correspond to the following Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs):

    • ASPA No. 125: Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (25 de Mayo)  (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 145: Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 146: South Bay, Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago (Chile).
    • ASPA No. 150: Ardley Island (Ardley Peninsula), Maxwell Bay, King George Island (25 de Mayo)  (Chile).

The coordinators for each of the four plans under review are: Ceisha Poirot ASPA 125, Anoop Tiwary ASPA 150, Polly Penhale ASPA 145, Astrid Høgestøl ASPA 146.
The revision of the management plan corresponding to ASPA 144 “Chile Bay (Discovery Bay), Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands" was placed on hold by CEP XXI, pending further discussions and decisions on the possible de-designation of the Area (paragraph 68 of the CEP XXI Final Report)
The four management plans referred above are still under review by the proponent (Chile), so the revised versions on which the SGMP would provide advice were not available for this purpose. Therefore, there is no progress to report at the time of the presentation of this document. 
As suggested by a party during the intersessional discussions, the coordinator will provide the Group with an update of the pending aspects of each plan's revision, in order to detect opportunities for collaboration with the proponent country of the plans. This information will be circulated to the SGMP before the CEP XXII begins.
Likewise, we must highlight that during the intersessional discussions, several Parties expressed their interest in the SGMP working on the development of alternative procedures or tools that allow progress in the revision of management plans that remain under the scope of the SGMP for several intersessional periods. This task is in accordance with the ToR 4, and has been incorporated into the proposed work plan. 
    3. Task under ToRs 4 and 5

    • “Work with relevant Parties to ensure progress on review of management plans overdue for five year review”

Through the SGMP forum, Parties that may need advice to initiate the five-year review of Management Plans were invited to contact the SGMP if they so wished. No requests were received, but we should recall that the SGMP is available to advise, facilitate or guide the review tasks when necessary.

    •  “Consider further improvements to the Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation”

During CEP XX, the Committee endorsed the Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation and agreed to forward it to the ATCM for approval, (paragraph 136. XX CEP Final Report). The ATCM approved the guidelines and adopted them through Resolution 1 (2017).

In addition, the Committee agreed that in a future revision of this Guidance it could be useful to include a scheme or table that would illustrate/summarize the process of evaluating and drawing conclusions with regard to assessing an area for potential ASMA designation. It was noted that this could further improve the guidelines and facilitate the decision-making process. (Paragraph 133 CEP XX Final Report).

This task was postponed the previous intersessional period, given the need to reduce the issues to be addressed during the CEP XXI in Buenos Aires, differing this task for the intersessional period 2018/2019. In order to begin with this task, the coordinator of the SGMP provided the Group with a suggested draft flowchart based on the content of the “Guidelines for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation”.

The draft flow-chart intends to provide a possible sequence of different steps or “routes” to follow during the assessment process of a potential ASMA. 

During the elaboration and exchanges between the members of the Group, some modifications were proposed to the flowchart and it was stressed that it was a good model of the process. It was also indicated that there are many ways to deal with multiple activities/overlapping activities without following the route to an ASMA, so consideration of other means of protection and management was an important step in the process summarized in the flowchart. 

We also took into account that the process of evaluating an area with potential to become an ASMA may be more complex than that of the ASPAs and may require analysis of more aspects and the involvement of several stakeholders and their interactions. The uniqueness of each ASMA was also highlighted as well as the difficulty of capturing the complexities of determining whether the ASMA tool or another management tool is required.

The modifications proposed by the members of the Group were incorporated into the draft flowchart and the result is presented in Annex II.

With the incorporation of the flowchart, the Guideline would contain a tool similar to the one included in the “Guidelines for implementation of the Framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol”, (Figure 1) of Resolution 1 (2000).

Finally, comments were received on the content Guidelines themselves although this task was not among those assigned to the Group. Despite this, as the contributions received were considered very valuable, these were compiled in Annex 3. The purpose of this compilation is to keep it in mind for the moment in which moving forward with the revision is decided by the Committee. 


    • Proposed Work Plan for the SGMP, for the intersessional period 2019/20
The SGMP proposes the following Work Plan to which other actions that CEP XXII may consider appropriate may be added.

Terms of Reference
Suggested tasks
ToR 1 to 3
Review draft management plans referred by CEP for intersessional review and provide advice to proponents (including the four pending plans from previous intersessional period)
ToR 4 and 5
Work with relevant Parties to ensure progress on review of management plans overdue for ﬁve year review

Work on the development of alternative procedures or tools that allow progress in the revision of management plans that remain for several intersessional periods under the scope of the SGMP.

Review and update SGMP work plan
Working Papers
Prepare report for CEP XXI against SGMP ToR 1 to 5

The Group will also be able to incorporate into its work plan any task that could arise from the outcomes of the SCAR/CEP Workshop on Further Developing the Antarctic Protected Area System to be held before the start of the upcoming CEP.
Finally, it was also suggested that, as the development of guidance material continues (as listed and linked on the Protected Area page of the ATS website), the group might like to consider how the various existing documents complement and support each other, and whether they all contain current information. A task for the future might be to consolidate and review the guidance material where it is not complementary. It was indicated that this review might inform tasks for future work plans.  The Group and the Committee may consider this proposal and include it in the work plan, when appropriate.

    5. Advice to the CEP
The SGMP provides the following advice to CEP:

    • That the four management plans pending in the previous periods continue to be within the scope of the SGMP, in order to provide advice once the proposing country has made the revised versions available to the Group and that the CEP endorse the proposal to explore mechanisms and additional tools to facilitate the review of pending plans.
    • That the CEP include the flowchart prepared by the SGMP, in the “Guidance for assessing an area for a potential Antarctic Specially Managed Area designation”.
    • That the CEP consider the Work Plan and suggests appropriate modifications if needed, based on the deliberations during CEP XXII.

Annex I. Revised Terms of Reference for the Subsidiary Group on Management Plans. (CEP XIII. Final Report. Appendix 1) 

    1) Examine any draft new or revised Management Plan to consider, in consultation with relevant experts if appropriate:
    • whether it is consistent with the provisions of Annex V to the Protocol, particularly Articles 3, 4 and 51, and with relevant CEP guidelines2;
    • its content, clarity, consistency and likely effectiveness3;
    • whether it clearly states the primary reason for designation4; and
    • whether it clearly states how the proposed Area complements the Antarctic protected areas system as a whole5. 

    2) Advise proponents of suggested amendments to the draft Management Plan to address issues in relation to 1) above.

    3) Submit a Working Paper to the CEP with recommendations for the adoption or otherwise of each new or revised draft Management Plan, identifying where the Plan reflects comments received by Members, and where they have not been, the reasons for not doing so. The Working Paper is to include all revised Management Plans and the information required by the ATCM’s Legal and Institutional Working Group.

4) Provide advice to the CEP as necessary for the purpose of improving Management Plans and the process for their intersessional review. 

5) Develop and suggest procedures that would assist in achieving a long-term goal aiming at ensuring that all ASPA and ASMA management plans contain adequate content, and are clear, consistent and likely to be effective6.
