Revised Management Plan and maps for ASMA No.7 Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin 
Working Paper submitted by the United States
Summary
The area surrounding Palmer Station was originally designated as Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) No.7 through Measure 1 (2008) in order to protect its scientific and environmental values, and in view of the need to coordinate management of activities to ensure that these values can be sustained for the long-term. Since its adoption in 2008, the Management Plan was revised and adopted through Measure 14 (2010), which included minor amendments to the Operations Zone and updates to the plan maps. Subsequently, the Antarctic Treaty Parties have adopted revisions to the management plans for several other ASMAs, most recently ASMA No.2 McMurdo Dry Valleys (Measure 18, 2015) and ASMA No.5 Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (Measure 8, 2017), and has also adopted the Guide to Preparation of ASMA Management Plans (Resolution 1, 2017).
The United States initiated work on revisions to the management plan and maps for ASMA No.7 Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin in 2015. Field work was undertaken in December 2016 to make a first-hand appraisal of whether the Management Plan is meeting its objectives. Consultation was undertaken with those responsible for science, operations and management within the Area, including with the scientific community. The consultation verified whether the Management Plan is operating as intended, that the values of the Area are being adequately maintained, and that activities were being successfully coordinated to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise.
A number of updates to the Management Plan and maps for ASMA No.7 have been necessary to ensure that visitors to the Area follow the latest policies agreed and have access to current information. The following sections briefly describe the proposed amendments made to the management plan and maps.
Background
Formal review of the ASMA No. 7 Management Plan was initiated in 2015 in accordance with the requirements of Annex V to the Protocol, and this work has been on-going. Consultation with members of the science community, with the station management team, and with Non-Governmental Visitor groups represented by IAATO, has now been completed. Based on the inputs received during the consultations, adjustments have been made to the Management Plan as needed to ensure that all activities can be conducted safely, environmentally responsibly and without disruption to scientific programs.
Summary of amendments to the Management Plan for ASMA No. 7
Several revisions and updates to the management plan and maps have been made. As a means to manage potentially conflicting activities the original management plan defined three zones: Operations, Restricted and Visitor. This management framework has worked well since the original plan was adopted in 2008. As a result, the revised management plan remains consistent with that approach, and revisions made are considered refinements and incremental improvements based on experience using the management plan. Revisions have also been made to maintain consistency with policies and management plans adopted for other ASMAs within the Antarctic Treaty area.
The boundary of the ASMA remains largely unchanged, although there has been a minor adjustment in the northwest of the Area where the boundary now follows the 64°06' W line of longitude, instead of 64°06'33"W. This adjustment simplifies the boundary and allows inclusion of several more islands within the Area near the Rosenthal Islands. The boundary following the Anvers Island coastline has been revised to reflect recent retreat of the ice margin along the Anvers Island coast. Following the boundary revisions the Area is now 3238 km2.
The principal changes made to the management zones within the Area may be summarized as follows:
    • The Operations Zone boundary has been enlarged slightly to follow the current margin of the Marr Ice Piedmont, which has retreated by ~100 m since 2007.
    • The Shortcut Point / Shortcut Island Restricted Zones have been merged into a single zone, which is for practical reasons because of their proximity to each other.
    • The Joubin Islands Restricted Zone has been extended to encompass the entire island group. Improved mapping revealed additional islands that had previously been excluded from this zone.
The appendices to the Management Plan have been substantially revised. The structure is now consistent with the management plans for ASMA No. 2 McMurdo Dry Valleys and ASMA No.5 Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which are working well. The former Appendix A Supporting Guidelines and Data has been divided into Appendix A General Environmental Guidelines and Appendix B Environmental Guidelines for Scientific Research. The former Appendix B is now Appendix C General Guidelines for Non-Governmental Visitors. Appendix D Guidelines for Restricted Zones and Appendix E Guidelines for Visitor Zones specifically address requirements within management zones. An appendix for the Operations Zone was not considered necessary, with applicable policies covered elsewhere in the plan. The former Appendix C is now Appendix F.
The most substantial additions to the Management Plan are included in Appendix D Guidelines for Restricted Zones, which incorporates site-specific guidance and maps for all 15 of the sensitive Restricted Zones. The purpose is to make available information on the sensitive features within each zone to all scientists and logistics personnel who may visit these sites. Until now, site specific information on the distribution of bird species, for example, was largely held by those conducting ornithological research, and was not necessarily easily accessible to scientists in other disciplines. The aim is to raise awareness among all visitors to the Restricted Zones of the types of features that are particularly sensitive and the recommended protective measures.
Detailed maps for the two ASPAs within the Area (ASPA No. 113 Litchfield Island and ASPA No.139 Biscoe Point) have been removed from the ASMA plan, although their locations are still shown on several other maps for the ASMA (Maps 1 – 3). These maps were removed because they were considered more relevant to ASPA site visits and are already available as part of the ASPA management plans. Copies of the ASPA management plans and maps are always provided to personnel visiting ASPAs. 
A summary of changes made to the text of the Management Plan is provided in Appendix 1 of this Working Paper, and changes made to maps in Appendix 2.

The United States recommends that the CEP approve the attached revised management plan and maps for ASMA No.7 Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin.
