Challenges that might occur in relation to increased air operations in the Antarctic Treaty area: 
A national Antarctic program perspective
Background
The physical conditions in the Antarctic Treaty area present challenges to all human activity there. Understanding the activity, or any changes in that activity, and its accompanying risk, and then putting policy and procedures in place to manage, mitigate or eliminate those risks, is the universal responsibility of all those who are active in the area.
Aviation, or air operations, in the Antarctic Treaty area brings with it a number of benefits and a number of risks. This paper does not address the many benefits, except to note that the level and breadth of Antarctic science would not be possible without air operations.1 This paper also does not address environmental risks. 
This paper presents a national Antarctic program perspective of practical and technical challenges of ensuring safe air operations as a result of any increased air operations in the Antarctic Treaty area and proposes recommendations for ATCM consideration. (See also COMNAP ATCM XLII (2019) IP002). 
Increasing air operations
Future prospects for the global aviation industry indicate significant growth in passenger numbers and cargo carrying. There has been growth since 1995 in total (governmental and commercial) Antarctic inter-continental flights, with the level of activity to/from each gateway varying and serving a different geographic Antarctic hub.  Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in countries that are inter-continental air gateways invest resource into their air infrastructure and its maintenance and also invest and maintain the Antarctic-based air gateway facilities.
Parties through their national Antarctic programs have developed and maintained and continue to invest resource into intra-continental air infrastructure as well.  Non-governmental operators are also contributing to this intra-continental network and we are seeing collaborative partnerships between governmental and non-governmental operators. New runways are opening and there is expansion of the use of rotary-wing aircraft, particularly to/from vessels operating near the Antarctic coast. 
Such increase in activity is not new and has been considered by the Parties several times in the past. 
Any increase in air activity, regardless of whether it is governmental or commercial, brings with it increased risks that must be addressed. In cases of emergency, it is often the national Antarctic programs that are called upon to respond.
In areas of Antarctica where there are currently air operations, the challenges related to any increase in air activity are:
    • To de-conflict air space.
    • To address the pressures placed on inter-continental external gateways for increased support.
    • To reduce the pressures placed on the inter-continental Antarctic airfields and associated stations for increased support.
    • To address pressures on the five Rescue Coordination Centres (RCCs) that have Antarctic Search and Rescue (SAR) responsibilities.
    • To eliminate pressure on national Antarctic programs in regards to diversion of their assets, including personnel, from science/science support activities to SAR-related activity and increased need to provide usual air operations support (for example: runway preparations, refuel-provision, fire-fighting response).
In areas with no current air operations, the challenges related to any increase in any air activity include:
    • The aircraft operator’s ability to obtain information on conditions in area of air operations.
    • The aircraft operator’s ability to obtain weather forecasts.
    • The aircraft operator’s ability to identify alternative landing sites. 
    • Limited ability for RCCs to coordinate a response in any under-explored areas.
    • Limited ability, or risk too high, for a national Antarctic program or commercial operator to deploy assets, including personnel, to an incident/accident. Including, since most national Antarctic programs are not aircraft operators themselves, there may not be aircraft available to deploy to Antarctic areas beyond their normal area of operations and there is often no possibility (risk is too great) to traverse across previously untested, ice-covered terrain.
    • There is a lack of infrastructure in most areas of the Antarctic and therefore no access to a “place of safety”. An ability to be self-sufficient for prolonged periods is required.
    • Many national Antarctic programs stations have medical capabilities, but they are limited and geared towards the medical needs of station personnel, with facilities and medical personnel not equipped for large numbers of people requiring treatment.
Information exchange
To de-conflict uncontrolled airspace advanced information exchange is critical.  This was recognised early on by the ATCM including at ATCM I with Recommendation I-VI (1962) and in ATCM III (1964) III-1. The Meeting of Experts on Air Safety in Antarctica (1989) resulted in ATCM Recommendation XV-20 (no longer current) and subsequently ATCM XXVI Resolution 1 (2013) “Air safety in Antarctica”, that states: “for the purpose of ensuring the safety of air operations in the Antarctic Treaty area, Parties should exchange…information about their planned air operations in accordance with the standardized format of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES).” It also requests COMNAP to produce the Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM) through information provided by national Antarctic operators.
Even given these ATCM recommendations, there are challenges related to information exchange, including:
    • Confidence regarding the currency of pre-season EIES operational information on national expeditions involving aircraft and on non-governmental expeditions involving aircraft activities and vessels. 
    • Confidence regarding the currency of the permanent EIES operational information on stations and aircraft.
    • Confidence regarding the currency and completeness of the COMNAP information from national Antarctic programs, in regards to governmental activity only, on their Antarctic facilities, including air operations-related facilities, communications and metrological centres. 
    • Collectively this advanced information exchange is not sufficient to provide a comprehensive, reliable picture of all air activities in the Antarctic Treaty area.
    • Even with information exchange, it is challenging for air operators to identify and ensure that their alternative landing sites2 will be personned, and to confirm whether those persons are aware that they may be called upon in support of the use of the landing site in an emergency situation.
    • Lack of ability to enforce exchange of information by all operators for inclusion in COMNAP information exchange tools (e-AFIM, Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM) and COMNAP Asset Tracking System (CATS)).

Communications
Communications during normal flight operations is required in order to understand status of air activity at any given time and to de-conflict air space.  It is also used to take the “search” out of any necessitated SAR operation. There are challenges involving communications during air operations.  Any increase in air activity adds to those challenges.
During normal air operations, challenges include:
    • Not having complete, real-time, situational awareness of all aircraft in the Antarctic Treaty area. This could be solved by mandatory use of innovation position and tracking technology in all aircraft. There is no mandatory requirement for this technology use in the Antarctic Treaty area at the present time.  
    • Current voluntary tracking systems, such as the CATS, are not attracting 100% participation. That is, even at the present time available communications tools are not being used by some governmental entities. This makes the systems less reliable and less valuable as a communications tool. Their use should be strongly encouraged, or made mandatory, for all vessels and aircraft supporting governmental activity in the Antarctic Treaty area.
During an air operations emergency situation, challenges also include:
    • Ensuring all personal involved are aware of and have in place a robust communication plan, coupled with identified points of contact who understand their SAR roles and responsibilities.
    • Ensuring all personnel involved have emergency response training.
General
Many national Antarctic programs already have policy in regards to tourist visits.  As air activity in the Antarctic Treaty area increases, it is likely that programs will have to consider or reconsider their policies in regards to station visitations by non-governmental personnel. Policy-adjustments must be made when proposed visitor numbers increase or are greater than the level anticipated. Any increase in visitor numbers may impact station operations and support to science/national activities. This is not exclusive to air activity, but applies equally to visits by ship.  
All air operators must address challenging and changing weather conditions. Sea ice changes and expansion to the traditional Antarctic research season will require changes to air operations and infrastructure. The relative lack of infrastructure specific to air activity and fuel availability in cases of unplanned landings, the remoteness and vastness and lack of medical infrastructure and trained personnel in the event of a mass casualty situation add to the challenges. Most of these services are available only through support from national Antarctic programs. 
The ICAO Chicago Convention3 established certain principles and arrangements so international civil aviation can develop in a safe and orderly manner. Compliance with ICAO operating standards is vital for safe Antarctic aircraft operations. New air operators may not be fully aware of the particular Antarctic situation as there is no mandatory training or education course. Applications are made on the grounds of environmental management procedures not competence or understanding of practical challenges. Air operators must be aware of and respect designated no-fly zones, including areas protected for their science values and ASPAs that include no-fly zone previsions. 
Safe air operations requires continued investment by the Parties. 



Recommendations to ATCM for consideration
Noting that inter-continental and intra-continental air activities are vital to the success of national Antarctic programs for operations, logistics and for science;
Considering that the SCAR Antarctic and Southern Ocean Horizon Scan and the COMNAP Antarctic Roadmap Challenges projects indicated that “…future science requirements critically depend on an expansion of intra-Antarctic flights and ground-traversing capabilities, including expanding into under-studied but scientifically interesting regions”4;
Also considering that trends indicate that there will be a significant global increase in air activity in the next 25 years; 
Recalling that, generally, informal air operations reporting requirements are in place in the Antarctic Treaty area; and
Reiterating the fundamental importance of ensuring safe air operations in the Antarctic, and the continued recognition that the principal body of knowledge and experience of Antarctic air operations, and its current challenges, lies with the operators of national Antarctic programmes;

COMNAP recommends that the ATCM consider the following:

    1. Request that Parties share information of all proposed air operations, in advance of those operations, in order to de-conflict active airspace;
    2. Improve the clarity and completeness of the EIES Pre-season Operational Information, especially in regards to both “National Expeditions” and “Non-Governmental Expeditions” in the category “vessels” and “vessel-based expeditions”, respectively, to explicitly include a data field requesting information on any/all rotary-wing aircraft that will be in operation or carried on-board the vessel, dates of operation and areas of deployment;  
    3. Improve the clarity and completeness of the EIES Pre-season Operational Information, especially in regards to both “National Expeditions” and “Non-Governmental Expeditions” in the category “aircraft” and “aircraft activities”, respectively, to explicitly include a data field requesting information on any/all RPAS that will be in operation, dates of operation and areas of deployment;  
    4. To broaden the request as proposed by ATCM Resolution 1 (2013), paragraph 3c, currently operative as recommending that “national Antarctic operators… provide information for the purpose of maintaining the AFIM” to be more inclusive of all air operators, governmental and non-governmental alike. So as to strongly encourage Parties through their national Antarctic programs, their military involved in support to Antarctic operations and to non-governmental actors that intend to operate airfields or run air operations in Antarctic, to actively maintain through COMNAP the currency of their information which informs AFIM and ATOM, and ensure consistency of information across the various data repositories within the ATS;
    5. Request that all Antarctic air operators, government and non-governmental alike, ensure that they aware of safety requirements, and have identified alternative landing sites and communicated in advance with those associated with any alternative landing sites, to ensure they are aware that they may be requested to be used as a back-up in an emergency situation;
    6. That technology advances will continue to support safe and effective air operations in Antarctica. Innovative existing technology now allows for tracking of aircraft in real-time, and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Such technologies should be considered mandatory for inclusion and regular use in all aircraft operating in Antarctica.  Parties are encouraged to continue to invest in technologies that will improve efficiency, communications, collaboration and safety in operations;
    7. That any increase in air activity brings with it increased risks that must be managed or mitigated, and in cases of SAR or emergency it is the national Antarctic programs that are often called upon to respond. This should be considered when Parties are made aware of non-governmental applications for air activities that are not in support of science; 
    8. That COMNAP has good awareness only of governmental air operations. Parties’ Competent Authorities that are contacted by non-governmental entities who are proposing to undertake air activities in the Antarctic Treaty area, are encouraged to register that contact with the COMNAP Secretariat for situational awareness of the proposed non-governmental activity and to ensure that if the proposed non-governmental activity is permitted/authorised by the Competent Authority, that the entity is given access to the current release of AFIM and is aware of the SAR agency  with SAR responsibilities over the proposed area of operation.
