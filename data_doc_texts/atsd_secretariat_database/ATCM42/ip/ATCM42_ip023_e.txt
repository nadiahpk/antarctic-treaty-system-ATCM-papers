Antarctic Environments Portal: Content Management Plan
Information Paper submitted by Australia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, United States, SCAR

Summary
The Antarctic Environments Portal continues to provide the CEP and Antarctic Treaty Parties with a reliable source of information on issues of policy and management relevance.  
A Content Management Plan for the Portal has been developed and is appended to this Information Paper.
The content management plan aims to provide a more structured approach to developing articles for the Portal and for facilitating a dialogue with the CEP to allow Committee Members to have input to the articles published on the Portal website. 


Content Management Plan
As recorded in Working Paper 52, the Management Board and Editorial Group of the Portal have developed a Content Management Plan so as to provide a more structured approach to the development of Information Summaries and Emerging Issue content.  
The Content Management Plan aims to identify a series of topics or issues for which knowledge summaries are required so as to ensure that the content published on the Portal website is contemporary and relevant to current issues being attended to by the CEP and ATCM.
The Content Management Plan is regularly reviewed and updated by the Editor and Editorial Group.
The Portal Content Management Plan also offers a useful mechanism for engaging with the CEP and for offering the Committee an opportunity to provide feedback on Portal content that it wishes to see prepared.
The Committee is invited to provide comment on the utility of the content management plan, and to provide feedback on content that it wishes to see prepared for publication on the Portal website.

Antarctic Environments Portal - Content Management Plan
The following table sets out a series of subject matter headings that are currently under consideration for development as Portal Information Summaries, or are currently being drafted, and indicates the relevance of the planned knowledge summaries against the CEP’s 5-year Work Plan and Climate Change Response Work Programme.  
This table will be updated annually based on feedback provided.
