Strengthening Support for the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

Information Paper submitted by Australia, France and Spain

Summary

This paper reports on representations conducted by Consultative Parties in accordance with Resolution 1 (2012) and the 2016 Santiago Declaration, which encourage states that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but are not yet Party to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (“Madrid Protocol”) to accede to it. While 40 of the Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty are party to the Madrid Protocol, including the 29 Consultative Parties, there are 14 Non-Consultative Parties that are not yet party to the Madrid Protocol.  
In 2019 Australia, France and Spain, together with other Consultative Parties, made representations to seven Non-Consultative Parties not yet party to the Protocol.  All States approached expressed support for the objectives and principles of the Protocol.  A number of states are undertaking steps to accede to the Protocol or have decided to do so, but others were unable to provide responses due to domestic elections, and some said that they were still considering the steps required to accede.

Background	
In accordance with Resolution 1 (2011) and Resolution 1 (2012), in the period from 2012 to 2014 Australia, France and Spain coordinated three round of outreach by Consultative Parties to encourage states that were Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Madrid Protocol to accede to it1. Since the commencement of these outreach efforts, there have been a further six new parties to the Madrid Protocol.  
In the 2016 Santiago Declaration on the Twenty Fifth Anniversary of the signing of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty the Consultative Parties welcomed the increase in Parties to the Madrid Protocol and encouraged other States that are committed to the objectives and purposes of the Protocol to accede.

Preparation and conduct of the representations in the intersessional period 

Australia, France and Spain coordinated a fourth round of representations in April and May of 2019, which were undertaken with support and participation from 13 other Consultative Parties (see Annex 1). Representations were made to four States that had earlier indicated that the process of ratification/accession was on-going and likely to occur in the near future, and a further three States2 that had become Party to the Treaty since 2014.
These renewed efforts to encourage accessions to the Protocol were considered to be particularly timely given the celebration of the Antarctic Treaty’s 60th anniversary later this year.  
In conducting the representations, Australia, France and Spain prepared a supporting aide-memoire. Supporting documentation and information on the Madrid Protocol and steps required for accession was also prepared and handed over as appropriate.   

Outcomes of the representations

a)	Overall, the demarches indicated support for the objectives and principles of the Madrid Protocol. 

b)	One of the parties approached was well advanced in its domestic processes for ratification.  The legislative instrument was already approved and it is at present under legal review.  The next step would be to seek final governmental approval. 

c)	One of the parties approached expressed support for the Protocol and advised it would consider the possibility of accession. Another was of the view that joining the Protocol would be in line with their commitment to international environmental protection but underlined that formal approval of the Protocol would first require deeper legal review. 

d) 	Two other parties could not provide formal responses ahead of ATCM 42 due to the timing of national elections. 
 
e)        Another party was unable to express a clear commitment on the matter, as accession to the Protocol would imply a domestic restructure of competences among different Government agencies and also legislative changes that they are not in a position now to promote.  Another was unable to express a clear commitment but undertook to give the matter further consideration. 

Australia, France and Spain were encouraged by the support expressed by States for the objectives and principles of the Protocol and by the intention of some States to become Parties and/or accede to the Madrid Protocol. Given that not all states were able to commit to accession and/or ratification at this time, and that not all non-consultative Parties were approached during the recent demarches, it remains important for the Consultative Parties to continue to appeal to States that are Antarctic Treaty Parties but not yet Party to the Madrid Protocol to become Party to the Protocol. 
Australia, France and Spain consider that further intersessional work, in accordance with relevant ATCM decisions and declarations, would support: 
    • efforts to strengthen the Antarctic Treaty system;
    • harmonisation of standards for the protection of the Antarctic environment for all Antarctic Treaty Parties and their nationals;
    • continued growth in the community of States that have formally demonstrated their commitment to the objective of comprehensively protecting the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and that have designated Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science; and
    • the work of the Committee for Environmental Protection to provide advice and formulate recommendations to the Parties in connection with the implementation of the Protocol and its Annexes.
