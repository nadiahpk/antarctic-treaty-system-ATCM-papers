On the intention of the Republic of Belarus to request for the recognition of the Consultative Party status

Information paper submitted by the Republic of Belarus

The Republic of Belarus, being a Party to the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Treaty, 
- recognizing the value of the nature of the Antarctic as the heritage of mankind and the fragility of the natural complexes of Antarctica, 
- accepting the Antarctic as a continent of peace and cooperation, used only for peaceful purposes, 
- perceiving the Antarctic as a unique testing ground for scientific research and international scientific cooperation, 
- recognizing that a Contracting Party that has become a Party to the Antarctic Treaty through accession is entitled to appoint representatives to participate in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, 
informs the Consultative Parties on the intention to request for the recognition of the Consultative Party status.
The beginning of participation of Belarusian specialists in research of Antarctica dates back to the 1950th and have been pursued for many years in the framework of the Soviet and Russian Antarctic expeditions. All in all, for the period from 1955 to 1992 more than 130 specialists from Belarus visited Antarctica as members of different expeditions. Belarusian polar explorers contributed in scientific studies of the Southern continent.
The new phase of Antarctic research for the Republic of Belarus started in 2006, when the Republic of Belarus acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in virtue of the Belarusian Law No. 157-3 on accession of the Republic of Belarus to the Antarctic Treaty of July 19, 2006, and accessed to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 2008 according to the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No. 200 of April 10, 2008. In 2007, the Republican Centre for Polar Research was organised for the practical implementation of the objectives set by the National Program.
Since 2006 11 Belarusian Antarctic expeditions were organized. The organization of the Belarusian Antarctic expeditions was carried out with great logistical and other support from the Russian Antarctic expedition. In December 2007 the Belarusian seasonal field camp was organised near the Molodyozhnaya Russian Federation station at Mount Vechernyaya field base.
In the end of 2015 construction of Belarusian Antarctic station was began after consideration of the Draft CEE at XXXVII ATCM in Brasilia (2014) and later the Final CEE at XXXVIII ATCM in Sofia (2015). To date, the basis of the station infrastructure has been formed, including residential and service modules, power supply system etc. The station is operating in seasonal mode, but it is planned to be transformed into year-round operation. 
With the purpose of provision of scientific research in the Antarctic in 2006 the first National Program on Monitoring of the Earth’s Polar Areas and Promotion of the Arctic and Antarctic Expeditions in 2007-2010 and for the period up to 2015 was adopted (Ordinance of the Council of Ministers No. 1104 of August 31, 2006). It was succeeded by the Programs for the period 2011- 2015 and 2016-2020 (Ordinances of the Council of Ministers No. 587 on May 10, 2011 and No. 327 on 21 April, 2016). 
The main scientific objectives of the National Antarctic Programs are as follows: 
- geophysical studies of the atmosphere, including lidar measurements;
- comprehensive studies of ozone layer and UV radiation;
- hydro-meteorological studies and climate observations;
- geophysical and geochemical studies of the Earth’s crust;
- biological research, including the study of terrestrial and aquatic natural ecosystems, flora and fauna, microbiology;
- geo-ecological studies, including observations of changes of chemical composition of waters, soils and atmospheric depositions, evaluation of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems.
Important attention is paid to conducting environmental monitoring in the area of the Belarusian Antarctic Station, as provided for by the Protocol on Environmental Protection.
A number of scientific institutions of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (Institute for Nature Management, Center for Bioresources, Institute of Physics), National Ozone Monitoring Research and Education Center of the Belarusian State University and some others are involved in the study of Antarctica. 
In 2015 Belarusian Antarctic Program became a 30th member of COMNAP and actively participates in its activities. At XXXV SCAR delegates meeting in Davos (June 2018) Belarus became an associate member of SCAR. 
For 10 years of active Antarctic research, the Republic of Belarus has certain achievements in the field of studying the polar regions. Belarusian scientists made certain contribution to the study of Antarctica in a number of scientific areas. In 2016, two monographs were published on the results of the research. Results of investigations are published in peer-reviewed magazines.
In June 2018 scientists from Belarus participated in Polar2018 scientific event where presented results of their research. Three international scientific conferences on the problems of studying of the Antarctic were held in Belarus (2014, 2016, 2018). The delegation of the Republic of Belarus has been actively participated in the ATCM and CEP meetings since 2007, and presented a number of information and working documents.
Active cooperation with scientists from other countries in the field of Antarctic research is developing.
Information on the implementation of the requirements of the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection is regularly uploaded to the electronic information exchange system. Special attention set to elaboration of national legislation related to activities in the Antarctic. A plan has been approved for the development of a number of legislative acts on regulation of the issuing permits for activities in the Antarctic, environmental impact assessment, other issues. The procedures for ratifying of Recommendations and Measures adopted by the ATCMs and subsequently approved by all Consultative Parties are now discussed. 
In general, we believe that the scientific potential of the Republic of Belarus in the Antarctic, the capacities created are sufficient for requesting the recognition of the Consultative Party status. We plan to request in full compliance with Decision 2 (2017) and ask Consultative Parties to support us in our intention to obtain Consultative Party status.
