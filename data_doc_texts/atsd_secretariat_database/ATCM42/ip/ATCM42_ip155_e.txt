The International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds
Overview of the IOPC Funds’ policy on claims for pollution damage


Aim of document:  To provide an overview of the IOPC Funds’ policy on claims for pollution damage in order to contribute to discussions and considerations relating to the implementation of the mechanism envisaged under Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: ‘Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies’.


Background information

    1. The International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC Funds) provide financial compensation for oil pollution damage that occurs in its Member States, resulting from spills of persistent oil from tankers.
    2. During the late 1960s, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted two international treaties that organised the sharing of the cost of oil spill incidents at sea between the shipowner and the oil receivers and established the first International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund.   This international liability and compensation regime evolved over time and the current IOPC Funds were established through the entry into force of:
    • The 1992 Civil Liability Convention (1992 CLC) - This provides a first tier of compensation which is paid by the owner of a ship which causes pollution damage.
    • The 1992 Fund Convention - provides a second tier of compensation which is financed by receivers of oil in 1992 Fund Member States after sea transport (see below); and
    • The 2003 Supplementary Fund Protocol - Provides an extra layer of compensation to Supplementary Fund Member States. 
    3. Today, safer shipping means fewer incidents, however the risk of a major spill remains with some 1 800 million tonnes of oil transported by sea every year.  This risk has led to some 116 States opting to join the 1992 Fund and 32 of those opting to join the Supplementary Fund also.  A full list of Member States is set out at Annex I.
    4. Since their establishment, the 1992 Fund and the preceding 1971 Fund have been involved in some 150 incidents of varying sizes all over the world. No incidents have occurred so far which have involved or are likely to involve the Supplementary Fund. 

Compensation and Claims Management

    5. The 1992 Civil Liability and Fund Conventions cover pollution damage caused by persistent mineral oil spilled from a sea-going vessel constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk as cargo (normally a tanker). The 1992 Conventions cover not only spills of cargo and bunker oil (the vessel’s own fuel) from laden tankers, but also in certain circumstances spills of bunker oil from unladen tankers. 
    6. Examples of persistent mineral oil are crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil. Such oils are usually slow to dissipate naturally when spilled into the sea and are therefore likely to spread and require cleaning up. Damage caused by spills of non-persistent mineral oil, such as gasoline, light diesel oil and kerosene, is not compensated under the Conventions. Such oils tend to evaporate quickly when spilled and do not normally require cleaning up.
    7. To be entitled to compensation from the IOPC Funds, the pollution damage must result in an actual and quantifiable economic loss. The claimant must be able to show the amount of their loss or damage by producing accounting records or other appropriate evidence. 
    8. An oil pollution incident can generally give rise to claims for five types of pollution damage:

    • Property damage
    • Costs of clean-up operations at sea and on shore 
    • Economic losses by fishermen or those engaged in mariculture 
    • Economic losses in the tourism sector 
    • Costs for reinstatement of the environment 

    9. Claims are assessed according to criteria established by the Governments of Member States. These criteria, which also apply to claims against the Supplementary Fund, are set out in the 1992 Fund’s Claims Manual, which is a practical guide on how to present claims for compensation .
    10. The Funds, normally in co-operation with the shipowner’s insurer, usually appoint experts to monitor clean-up operations, to investigate the technical merits of claims and to assist the Secretariat with the assessment of claims.

Types of claims in the context of Annex VI – Liability Arising From Environmental Emergencies

    11. Upon entry into force, Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty will provide a framework for dealing with liability issues arising from the occurrence of environmental emergencies as defined in Article 2(b). In that context, the costs to be covered by the operator, the Party of that operator or the Fund would be limited to response costs, as defined in Article 2(f), including measures to avoid, minimise or contain the impact, including clean-up operations and the measuring of its environmental impact.
    12. This document will therefore detail further the criteria for admissibility of claims used by the IOPC Funds for clean-up and environmental damage claims.

Clean-up and preventive measures 
    13. Compensation is payable for the cost of reasonable clean-up measures and other measures taken to prevent or minimise pollution damage in a Member State, wherever these measures are taken. For example, if a response were undertaken on the high seas or within the territorial waters of a State that is not a Party to the Conventions in order to prevent or reduce pollution damage within the territorial sea or EEZ of a State Party, the cost of the response would in principle qualify for compensation. 
    14. Compensation is payable for the costs of reasonable measures taken to combat oil at sea, to protect resources vulnerable to oil (such as sensitive coastal habitats, seawater intakes of industrial plants, mariculture facilities and yacht marinas), to clean shorelines and coastal installations and to dispose of collected oil and oily wastes. Compensation is also paid for the costs of mobilising clean-up equipment and salvage resources for the purpose of preventive measures even if no pollution occurs, provided that the incident created a grave and imminent threat of causing pollution damage and on the condition that the measures were in proportion to the threat posed. 
    15. Compensation is also payable for reasonable costs associated with the capture, cleaning and rehabilitation of wildlife, in particular birds, mammals and reptiles. 
    16. The costs incurred, and the relationship between those costs and the benefits derived or expected, should be reasonable. For example, a high degree of cleaning, beyond removal of bulk oil, of exposed rocky shores inaccessible to the public is rarely justified, since natural cleaning by wave action is likely to be more effective. On the other hand, thorough cleaning is usually necessary in the case of a public amenity beach, particularly immediately prior to or during the holiday season. Account is taken of the particular circumstances of an incident. 


Environmental damage
    17. Compensation is payable for the costs of reasonable reinstatement measures aimed at accelerating natural recovery of environmental damage.  Contributions may be made to the costs of post-spill studies provided that they relate to damage which falls within the definition of pollution damage under the Conventions, including studies to establish the nature and extent of environmental damage caused by an oil spill and to determine whether or not reinstatement measures are necessary and feasible.
    18. Compensation is not paid in respect of claims for environmental damage based on an abstract quantification calculated in accordance with theoretical models.  Nor is compensation paid for damages of a punitive nature on the basis of the degree of fault of the wrong-doer.

Claims for the costs of reinstatement measures
    19. The Conventions cover the costs of reinstatement of the damaged environment.  The marine environment is in a constant state of flux.  Whether or not reinstatement measures will be needed depends on the sensitivity of the affected resources to contamination by oil and their natural rate of recovery.  The admissibility of such claims also depends on the viability of the measures proposed.
    20. Reinstatement measures should have the aim of accelerating recovery, that is re-establishing the biological community in which the organisms characteristic of that community at the time of the incident are present and are functioning normally.
    21. Reinstatement measures should be based on the application of Net Environmental Benefit Analysis (NEBA), sometimes referred to as Spill Impact Mitigation Assessment (SIMA).
    22. In principle, both direct and indirect reinstatement measures could be admissible for compensation. Reinstatement measures taken at a distance from the damaged site should maintain an essential link with the damaged environment and be directed to the reinstatement of the damaged habitats or resources rather than their replacement or the provision of an equivalent alternative or substitute elsewhere

Claims for the costs of post-spill studies
    23. Costs of post-spill studies are admissible in principle if they relate to damage which falls within the definition of pollution damage under the Conventions and if they are intended to quantify damage that is readily observable.  Studies aimed at the speculative investigation of hypothetical effects would not be admissible.  
    24. The scope of the study should be directed towards: 
    • establishing the nature, extent and likely duration of any damage that has occurred, and 
    • monitoring the recovery of damaged environments.  
    25. The scale of the study should be in proportion to the extent of the contamination, the likely effects of that contamination and the benefits achieved through reinstatement.  
    26. The study must provide reliable and useful information and should avoid repeating previous work or duplicating other ongoing studies or projects.
    27. Studies should follow principles of sound scientific investigation.
    28. In general, the approaches usually taken to carry out post spill studies can be categorised as follows:
    • Comparison of the pre-spill and post-spill ecological status of the affected resources as well as the levels of oil and its chemical components to which those resources were exposed both pre- and post-spill
    • Comparison of the affected area with uncontaminated reference sites or sites not impacted by the spill
    • Monitoring post-spill recovery of the communities and habitats contaminated by oil

Conclusion

    29. The international liability and compensation regime for oil spills from tankers is a system that works. The IOPC Funds have been successfully fulfilling their mission of compensating victims of oil pollution damage for over 40 years and now serve a membership of 116 Member States.  The uniform application of the Conventions and the adherence to the claims criteria established by States Parties, as described above, have been key to that success.  
    30. The IOPC Funds would therefore emphasise that when developing any system established under Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, due consideration should be given to the importance of a uniform approach and strong, clearly defined claims criteria. 
    31. Further information regarding claims admissibility criteria can be found on the IOPC Funds website (https://www.iopcfunds.org/publications/iopc-funds-publications/), in particular the Claims Information Pack which contains the following publications:
    • Claims Manual
    • Guidelines for presenting claims in the fisheries, mariculture and fish processing sector
    • Guidelines for presenting claims in the tourism sector
    • Guidelines for presenting claims for clean-up and preventive measures
    • Guidelines for presenting claims for environmental damage
    • Example Claim Form
    32. The IOPC Funds remains available and willing to provide guidance and support to the ATCM as it continues its consideration of the issue of liability arising from environmental emergencies in the Antarctic.  .
