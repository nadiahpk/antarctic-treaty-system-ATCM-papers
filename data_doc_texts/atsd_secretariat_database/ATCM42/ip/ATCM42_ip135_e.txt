 What Does the Paris Climate Agreement mean for Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environmental Protection?









SCAR Science Lecture 2019
What Does the Paris Climate Agreement mean for Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environmental Protection? 
Information Paper submitted by SCAR
Summary
The SCAR Science Lecture to XLII ATCM outlines the implications of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement1 for biodiversity and its protection in the broader Antarctic region, and for biodiversity conservation globally. The Lecture builds on the physical science and sea level implications of the 2015 Paris Agreement Lecture presented by SCAR at the Fortieth ATCM held in Beijing, China in 2017 (ATCM XL Information Paper 166). Key issues addressed in the 2019 SCAR Science Lecture are:

    • The currently documented consequences of global warming for Antarctic and Southern Ocean life, much of the evidence for which has emerged from SCAR’s current suite of Scientific Research Programmes which will be completed in 20202. 

    • The potential consequences of climate change into the future (up to 2100) for Antarctic and Southern Ocean biodiversity3 and its protection by means of the Antarctic Treaty system’s current mechanisms, including the Protocol on Environmental Protection and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Advances in understanding in the context of future climate pathways where 2°C of global warming is achieved, or alternatively, not achieved. 

    • The implications of sea level rise for the Sustainable Development Goals4, given not only direct effects, but also the potential consequences of extreme mitigation (manipulation of solar radiation) and adaptation (e.g. migration and alternative land use) strategies. 

    • Understanding the impacts and avoided impacts of achieving the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, for ATS members, their activities, and implications for the rest of the world is:

        ◦ of primary significance to the ATCPs as demonstrated in ATCM XLII Agenda Item 15 of Working Group 2;
        ◦ a foundational principle of the International Science Council of which SCAR is a member;
        ◦ at the heart of SCAR’s planned new Scientific Research Programmes5 to be launched in 2020;
        ◦ the basis of close collaboration between SCAR and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP)6 which facilitates support for the required science.
The Paris Climate Agreement – a Recap
    • The Paris Climate Agreement was signed by 194 countries in New York on Earth Day, 22nd April 2016, and the Agreement went into force on 7th November 2016.
 
    • The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming below 2°C - “the safe guardrail for dangerous climate change” identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and introduced by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Copenhagen in 2009.

    • Nationally determined commitments (NDCs) aimed to reduce all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero before the end of this century are the means to achieve the aim.

    • The NDCs if implemented, will restrict global warming to ~2.7°C. This is still above the UNFCCC safe guardrail and well-above the more ambitious goal of 1.5°C. Moreover, an assessment of current policy settings sees global temperatures stabilizing closer to 3.5°C.
Current and future effects on Antarctic and Southern Ocean biodiversity
    • Responses by species and by communities to anthropogenic change are already being detected on land across the Antarctic region.

    • Species in marine systems are changing in abundance and distribution, with global climate change often implicated, but ongoing uncertainty about attribution of cause.
Global conservation implications
    • Sea level rise estimates as a consequence of changes to the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets remain uncertain7,8.

    • Reducing that uncertainty is instrumental for understanding just how much land for urban use, agriculture and conservation will be lost, and how that will impact the Sustainable Development Goals4.  
Relevance to the ATS
    • The ATS is charged with the governance and environmental protection of an extraordinary and large part of the planet.
 
    • Climate change responses by species and communities are already bringing, and will continue to bring, significant challenges to that governance and protection.

    • Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and understanding the barriers to doing so require scientific knowledge from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, yet a minority of states have the capability to deliver that knowledge.

    • SCAR is a subsidiary body of the International Science Council (ISC), which has as a founding goal advancement of the science required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals9.

    • SCAR makes contributions to globally significant reports such as those of the IPCC and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) by nominating participants to attend meetings and candidates to be considered for authorship of reports.

    • SCAR’s new suite of Scientific Research Programmes, to be launched in 2020, aim further to mobilise the international science community to address the impact of climate change on Antarctic, Southern Ocean and global biodiversity.

    • Scientific outcomes are expected to further assist the Antarctic Treaty Parties in realising their obligations under the Protocol on Environmental Protection and other ATS agreements.

    • The foresight exercises10, planning, and information provision11 undertaken by the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) are essential for identifying and facilitating the support required to deliver those outcomes.
