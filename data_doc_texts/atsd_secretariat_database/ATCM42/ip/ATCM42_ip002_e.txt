Overview of Aviation Activity to inform ATCM discussions








Overview of Aviation Activity to inform ATCM discussions 
Information Paper prepared by
The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP)
ATCM request to COMNAP
The ATCM Multi-Year Strategic Workplan as adopted through ATCM Decision 7 (2017), lists as item 12 “Review and discuss issues related to increased aviation activity in Antarctica, and assess the need for additional action” and, in support of this asks “COMNAP and IAATO to provide an overview of aviation activity, and to present at the next ATCM XLI to inform discussion.” The Workplan also notes the dedicated discussion on air activity should include non-governmental air traffic and Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). 
Given the special circumstances of ATCM XLI, the aviation discussion was postponed to ATCM XLII (2019).  
COMNAP is pleased to provide this Information Paper in response to the request for an overview. This Information Paper should be read along with COMNAP Working Paper 8. Together, they present the COMNAP overview of aviation activity and therefore focus on the national Antarctic programs and air activity in support of governmental science, operations and logistics. This Information Paper also includes some information on non-governmental air activity but is not a comprehensive overview of that aspect of air activity in the Antarctic Treaty Area. Section I focuses only on personned aircraft and related air activity. Section II focuses on RPAS. Other aspects of air activity such as research rockets, tethered and untethered balloons, and other forms of aviation activity are out of scope of this paper.
COMNAP recognizes that activities in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.  This overview of aviation activity does not address the environmental aspect of air activity.
COMNAP was also invited by letter from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat to include an aviation expert as part of the COMNAP delegation to the ATCM to inform discussions. We are very pleased to include the Leader of the COMNAP Air Operations Expert Group in our ATCM XLII (2019) delegation.   



















SECTION 1
1.1 Setting the scene: Global trends
Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, it is nearly twice the size of Australia. In regards to air infrastructure, Australia currently has approximately 530 active1 airfields, while Antarctica currently has 55 active2 airfields. Prospects for the global aviation industry indicate that growth of passenger numbers is expected to reach 16 billion passengers per year by 2050 (a 384% increase from 2015) and air freight is expected to increase to 400 million tons (from 50 million tons in 2015).3 As global air traffic increases, flights over Antarctica may increase.
Growth in air travel whether globally or in Antarctica, has ramifications for operations and increases operations risk, that is, the risk incurred by people and their organizations in day-to-day activities. However, the aviation industry is a very safe industry. In 2017, some 4.1 billion travelers flew safely on 41.8 million commercial flights, with 2017 being the safest year on record for commercial air travel-there were no commercial passenger jet fatalities in the year.4 Globally, international air transport has developed and has become more complex over the past half century. The same can be said of Antarctic air activity but on a much smaller scale. 
Global standards, that mitigate and address aviation risk, are set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). All ICAO Member states must comply with, or seek approval for filing a difference to, the Annex of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and the ICAO Standards, Recommended Practices and Procedures. 
1.2 Setting the scene: The Antarctic Treaty area
Effective and safe air operations into and within the Antarctic Treaty area continues to be a critical tool for science and the logistics to support scientific endeavors. This was recognized as early as 1962 when the first Symposium on Antarctic Logistics was held and concluded, “The main point raised during the discussion was the following: The ability to fly to the continent is probably the largest factor in the whole operation of science in Antarctica.”5 

In addition, activities such as surveying and mapping, operations and logistics, monitoring, reconnaissance and marine surveillance activities6, and emergency response, including medical evacuations, in the Antarctic Treaty area are all supported by air operations to some extent. 
The Antarctic continent covers an area of 14 million km2 and the ocean area south of 60o south covers an area of 36 million km2. The remoteness of the continent and the large distances between stations and built infrastructure create an operating environment where co-operation between national Antarctic programs is essential and one where air activity is necessary.  As with global aviation, Antarctic aviation carries risks but remains a relatively safe activity. 7 

To fly to the Antarctic Treaty Area, requires an inter-continental flight (Figure 1) that would depart from one of five8 primary external (outside of the Antarctic Treaty Area) areas: 
    • Cape Town, South Africa
    • Christchurch, New Zealand 
    • Hobart, Australia
    • Punta Arenas, Chile
    • Rio Gallegos, Argentina

Figure 1: Graphic indicating primary inter-continental air routes (grey lines) with examples of travel distances, and sea route distances (COMNAP Antarctic Telecommunications Operators Manual (ATOM) 2017-updated 2019).


The level of activity to and from Antarctica from each of the above gateways varies, with some having more or less flights, carrying more or less passengers and cargo.
Table 1 illustrates flight activity from the primary gateway countries to Antarctica.9   The total number of flights in each column for a location includes both national Antarctic program and non-governmental organization flight activity.  The 1985 ̶ 1995 data is from a COMNAP survey from 1995.  The other, more recent information, for the three seasons from 2014 through 2017 was requested from and provided by the individual gateway airports in May 2017.  
Generally, since 1995, we do see an increase in total inter-continental flights to Antarctica. However, for the period from 2014 through 2017, the total, combined, overall inter-continental air traffic has remained relatively constant, with the 2016/2017 season seeing three additional flights than in the 2014/15 season.

Other airfield facilities in the Antarctic Treaty area are used for intra-continental flights. 








In total, as at 25 October 2018, the COMNAP database contained information in regards to 55 active airfields in the Antarctic Treaty area (Table 2(a)) and 13 inactive airfields (Table 2(b)). The air operations infrastructure services 71 national Antarctic program Antarctic stations10 and a range of camps, laboratories and field science infrastructure (Figure 2).  






























Figure 2: Graphic showing locations of the active airfields in Antarctica. (Graphic background provided by USA Polar Geospatial Centre).




The great majority of aircraft land on airfields created on snow or ice. New techniques have been developed for creating these ice and snow runways. Currently, three gravel runways are in operation with a fourth under construction and with a plan for a paved runway in the long-term future being recently announced in the media.  Some older runways are expanding their length and service support. 
In addition to facilities and infrastructure related to fixed-wing aircraft, many national Antarctic programs utilize rotary-wing aircraft and therefore provide landing areas including helipads (various surface types and degrees of construction) and heliports at their stations for these aircraft. As at 26 October 2018, the COMNAP database contained information in regards to 73 rotary-wing-related infrastructures11 near stations. Rotary-wing aircraft are often used from vessels.

Table 2(b): In-active Antarctic airfields (COMNAP, 2018).
1.3 State-of-play: Air operators and co-operative arrangements
Only four12 national Antarctic programs are aircraft operators, meaning they own their own aircraft. Including those four, around 60%13 of national Antarctic programs use personned aircraft (includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft) in support of their activities. Many national Antarctic programs rely on their military for air operations and logistics or contract non-governmental air operators to provide air support for their programs. All Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties are signatory states to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (“Chicago Convention”) and therefore Member States to the ICAO. The aircraft operator is responsible to ensure that the aircraft complies with all safety-related regulations of the relevant Civil Aviation Authority.
Effective air operations require suitable and proximate Antarctic sites and surfaces, a range of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, the people with the skills to pilot and service the aircraft and to prepare and maintain landing areas, and on-the-ground facilities in the Antarctic Treaty area and at the air gateway locations external to the Antarctic Treaty area.  Secondarily, aircraft operations require accurate weather-forecasting and operation of communications centers which follow agreed communications protocols. 
While there is recognition of the importance of air operations in support of national Antarctic program activities, especially in support of science, not all national Antarctic programs have the resources to support air operation nor do they operate in areas of the Antarctic with suitable sites for fixed-wing air operations. The wider development of international collaboration in effective, safe and environmentally responsible Antarctic air operations remains a primary consideration on the COMNAP agenda.  In many cases, there are arrangements in place which utilize a model with includes governmental/military organizations and personnel, the lead national Antarctic program agency and their personnel, and non-governmental contractors in co-operation with another national Antarctic program.  As a result of this continuing recognition of the need of air activities in support of Antarctic science, there are long-term agreements between national Antarctic programs in regards to logistics pooling and aviation capabilities sharing.  
Regional co-operation makes good sense and is the norm, with regional aviation “hubs” in four distinct regions of operation in the Antarctic (Figure 3).  They are:
    • In the East Antarctica hub, Australia, China, and the USA collaborate.  Australia also collaborates with France, Italy and New Zealand in this area and between this area and the Ross Sea hub.
    • In the Dronning Maud Land (DML) hub, The Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN) is an international collaborative project of the national Antarctic programs of Belgium, Finland, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom with stations and scientific interest in the wider DML area.14  Under this collaboration, the services of a primary contractor Antarctic Logistics Centre International (ALCI) are used alongside the various national Antarctic program assets and facilities for inter-continental air transport of passengers and cargo to and from Cape Town, South Africa, and to organise intra-continental feeder flights to various destinations within the DML and beyond.
    • In the Ross Sea hub, Italy, New Zealand and the USA have collaborated for many years to share both contracted and military aircraft for cargo and passenger movements to and from Christchurch, New Zealand, and around the continent.  The Republic of Korea and Germany through its Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), and France also collaborate with Italy in the Terra Nova Bay Region of the Ross Sea, including on flights to/from Concordia Station.
    • In the West Antarctica/Peninsula hub, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, United Kingdom and Uruguay are the primary air operators with heavylift military aircraft and national Antarctic program-owned air assets used to provide air logistics and support to nineteen national Antarctic programs. 

Contracted aviation support can transfer easily from one national program to another to further reduce the number of aircraft flying on the continent and reduce operational cost.

COMNAP conducted a survey of COMNAP Member aviation activity covering three recent seasons (2014 ̶ 2017).  The intent of this survey was to collect recent information to establish any trends within national Antarctic program activity and establish a historical baseline for future comparisons.
Table 3 contains the data from the survey, showing flight activity information for specific locations throughout Antarctica.  For this table, national Antarctic programs provided information of both national Antarctic programs and non-governmental (NGO) flight activity (if any), so as to include all types of activity from that particular location.  Each flight activity reported is a single take-off from the location.  Take-offs include both intra-continental flights and inter-continental flights.  Not all locations are included in this table.  Locations were chosen as sampling of various areas around the continent.

1.4 State-of-play: Types of aircraft used
The number and type of personned aircraft utilized by the national Antarctic programs is listed in Table 4.  The list includes a comparison with data collected by COMNAP in 1995, 2011 and in 201915.   Since the first survey in 1995, four countries have developed fixed-wing aircraft capabilities.

Table 4: Data from three sources that show the number and type of personned aircraft being utilized by the national Antarctic programs. 
A * indicates a rotary wing aircraft. 
Some newer jet aircraft are flying inter-continentally to long ice runways, but few new aircraft are flying into the interior of the continent.  The basic, light, fixed-wing aircraft20 have not changed in the past twenty years.  Efforts to bring a newer generation of ski equipped aircraft to the Antarctic have failed and investment remains with two proven platforms, the de Havilland Twin Otter and the Basler BT-67.  These are the preferred aircraft of both the national Antarctic programs and the non-governmental operators for remote operations.  Because of their limited range, these aircraft cannot transit from all gateway airports.  Their movement through South America and onto the Peninsula region of Antarctica creates an important characteristic of Antarctic aviation.   Most light, fixed-wing aircraft traffic, flown for both national Antarctic programs and the non-governmental operators, fly over the Peninsula and travel out from there intra-continentally. 
The data shows that for the period 1995–2019, there was a decrease in numbers of fixed-wing aircraft but an increase in rotary-wing aircraft in use in support of national Antarctic program activities (Figure 4). In general, overall, this resulted in an increase of total aircraft in operation (73 in 1995 compared to 84 in 2019). 


Figure 4: Total aircraft in operation in the Antarctic in support of national Antarctic program operations.

The difference is that in 1995 there were 66 fixed-wing aircraft in operation and seven rotary-wing aircraft; while in 2019 there are 48 fixed-wing aircraft and 36 rotary-wing aircraft in operation. The reduction in fixed-wing aircraft, even during a period when there is an increase in the number of countries participating through the Antarctic Treaty to undertake Antarctic science, likely reflects greater co-operation in transport  including the sharing of aircraft capacity through collaborative arrangements that did not exist in 1995.
The increase in rotary-wing aircraft is a reflection of many national Antarctic programs now having the capability to own and operate or contract operation services for helicopter operations. It also links directly to new stations built since 1995 and new ships brought on-line since 1995. The helicopters typically operate around stations, typically short-ranged, in clear weather, intra-continentally and often operate from vessels during operations near coastal Antarctica or as part of marine science survey operations and for search and rescue. This activity is usually well-managed by the national Antarctic program host station or ship. 
1.5 General: Seasonality of air operations
The majority of inter-continental flights operate during the period 1 October through 15 March each year, although several of the ten inter-continental airfields (see pages 4 and 5) are maintained year-round or can be activated on request year-round. During the relative warmer months of December and January, some of the airfields made of compacted snow or on ice are not usable, so alternative landing areas must be in place or flight operations must cease during this warmer period.  
Several national Antarctic programs are expanding their air operations seasons due to changing and increasing science demands, to support more frequent exchange of station personnel, and in cases where there is an urgent medical need. For example, the US Antarctic Program has traditionally supported inter-continental flights during late August each year calling these flights “WINFLY’, and has recently expanded their months of operation into a period called “winter flight operations” into McMurdo Station. The additional winter flight operations are to extend the traditional Antarctic science season and provide capability into March, April and June with one flight during each of those months. 
1.6 General: Air drops
In addition to landing aircraft with passengers and cargo, national Antarctic programs, their military agencies and non-governmental contractors carry out delivery of cargo via air drops. These can be scheduled deliveries or at times of emergency/critical need to Antarctic winter-over stations and vessels in distress in the marine environment. Such activity may depend on mid-air refuelling of the aircraft by another aircraft.
1.7 General: Communications  
Safe aircraft operation requires good communications.  The COMNAP Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM)21 identifies and provides contact details for all Antarctic communications centers. Sometimes these are set up specifically to monitor aircraft operations, sometimes they are the general communications centers at Antarctic stations.
Safe aircraft operations also normally requires that pilots communicate their flight intentions and identify alternate and emergency landing areas prior to any flight.  It is important to know the weather at these possible divert airfields (see next section) and know if the airfield will be open and able to accept aircraft in an emergency.  This is a common and widely accepted practice and should always be followed.  Antarctica presents a unique set of challenges because landing areas may be unpersonned, have poor communications, may have cargo and other equipment parked on the area or the immediate area, and may not have fuel.  All pilots should refer to the AFIM and ensure that they understand radio frequencies, airfield status, and suitability for emergency support at all landing sites that may be used.  A best practice would be for all pilots operating in the Antarctic to communicate before flight with the agency managing any possible emergency landing site prior to flight so that the agency is aware of the possibility of a divert to that airfield.  
1.8 General: Weather-forecasting
Substantial meteorological activity is required to support human operations in the Antarctic Treaty area. With flights taking place year-round, there is a need for accurate weather forecasts for the continent and good exchange of information between forecasters working in the Antarctic.22  Accurate weather forecasts include information such as: 
    • An outlook two to three days prior to a flight
    • A further outlook including route winds and Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs) 24 hours prior to take-off
    • Detailed forecasts and diversion route forecasts, satellite imagery, TAFs and alternative TAFs two to five hours prior to flight
    • Regular weather watch and phone/radio contact during flight, plus hourly Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs) and landing forecasts
    • Updated METAR and trend forecasts 30 minutes before the point of safe return.

Most Antarctic stations make surface synoptic observations that are reported on the global system and many make radiosonde observations.  Personnel at Antarctic stations are trained and take regular surface meteorological measurements. National Antarctic programs have deployed a range of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) across Antarctica which transit data to the Argos System on-board polar orbiting satellites. For the DROMLAN network, the DROMLAN flight weather service was established at Germany’s Neumayer Station III in cooperation with the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) and the German Weather Service (DWD) and a yearly training webinar is held before the start of each Antarctic season to ensure relevant personnel understand requirements. 
Beyond Antarctic stations, such as at field sites that require air operations, personnel are less likely to have weather observation experience. 
1.9 General: Management of Aviation Safety
Safety of human life remains the primary objective of COMNAP and all national Antarctic program Antarctic activity. The Chicago Convention23 established certain principles and arrangements so international civil aviation can develop in a safe and orderly manner. The Convention established ICAO, and ICAO works with the 192 Member States24 and industry groups to reach consensus on international civil aviation Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) and policies in support of safe, efficient, secure, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector. These SARPs and policies are used by ICAO Member States to ensure that their local civil aviation operations and regulations conform to global norms.  Adoption of ICAO safety standards is an accepted practice by all national Antarctic programs using aircraft. Compliance with ICAO operating standards as far as practicable25 is vital for safe aircraft operations in Antarctica.  These standards ensure that all aircraft operate in a predictable and uniform manner and allow aircraft to easily fly from station to station with a standard set of rules and familiar terminology.  
National Antarctic programs may request verification of certification and licensing from their contracted aircraft provider.  Each national Antarctic program can ensure that their aviation programs meet ICAO operation standards by requesting support from their national aviation organization to ensure compliance and complete safety inspections of operations and aircraft maintenance.
COMNAP contributes to the management of Member national Antarctic program aviation safety through its Air Operations Expert Group and through the continual development (based on best practice and peer-reviewed and industry publications) of three ATCM initiatives: 1) Search and Rescue (SAR) Workshops, 2) the Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM), and 3) the Antarctic Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Operator’s Handbook.
COMNAP promotes international collaboration for SAR activities in Antarctica through triennial SAR workshops.26  This effort supports both aviation and maritime SAR cooperation. The 4th COMNAP SAR Workshop was held in New Zealand in May 2019 co-hosted by Maritime New Zealand and Antarctica New Zealand.
The COMNAP AFIM is populated from data and information collated in the COMNAP database.  Each national Antarctic program that includes air operations is responsible to ensure that the data in the COMNAP database is accurate and up-to-date.  AFIM is now widely distributed to COMNAP Member national Antarctic programs in a digital format through the COMNAP website. The recent evolution to a digital product has meant the AFIM is an improved product that has the ability to include full graphics and can be published and distributed more readily and often as compared to the paper version.  
Technology, including Information and Telecommunications Technology Systems (“ICTS”), continues to rapidly advance and as aviation activity increases, so does aviation support technology.  Advances in technology are regularly applied to air operations and governments are encouraged to strive to ensure effective use and development of Antarctic ICTS.27 Such use and development requires investment. 
New anti-collision devices are smaller and cheaper and can easily be incorporated into aircraft.  Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) are required by international standard (ICAO) on all aircraft operating above the weight of 5,700 kg or capable of carrying more than 19 passengers.  TCAS equipped aircraft can detect and avoid any aircraft with an operating transponder.  This is a very useful capability for aircraft operating in Antarctica in uncontrolled airspace.28  
Some location transmitting devices can use satellite communications for automated position reporting and allow national Antarctic programs and RCCs to track their aircraft from any internet connected device, anywhere. These commercially available systems enhance operational and situational awareness and enhance search and rescue activities.
COMNAP is using similar technologies to improve the performance of its Ship Position Reporting System (SPRS) that all national Antarctic program vessels going south of 60oS are asked to participate in. The improved system called the COMNAP Asset Tracking System (CATS) is being developed to expand capabilities to include vessels and aircraft. This will increase operational awareness for science collaboration, for search and rescue, and for everyday operations and logistics in the Antarctic. Parties to the Antarctic Treaty are encouraged to request their operators, including military operators, to actively participate in this system by providing all aircraft and vessel position reports.
1.10 Critical importance of currency/reliability of data and information
The COMNAP products in support of collaboration and safety, including AFIM and ATOM, are only as reliable as the data that is input into the database. Therefore the data and information contained in the database requires regular and robust review by those involved in Antarctic operations, including air operations. All Parties should ensure that they nominate at least one point of contact, from the national Antarctic program and the air operator, who is responsible for regular review of data and submission of current data and information.  The AFIM is produced, updated, and digitally distributed as a tool for safe air operations in Antarctica in response to ATCM Resolution 1 (2013) which requests that “national Antarctic operators to provide information for the purpose of maintain the AFIM.” 
While AFIM is considered a restricted publication, it is made available to COMNAP Members, SAR authorities, military organizations that support Antarctic science and operations, IAATO and authorized or permitted non-governmental expeditions that make themselves known to COMNAP.29
SECTION II
2.1 Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)
In 2014, at ATCM XXXVII/CEP XXVII there was the first formal discussion on deployment of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS)30 in the Antarctic. This was in consideration of the potential for expanded use of RPAS in Antarctica.  As a result of those discussions, COMNAP, SCAR and IAATO were asked to consider the issue and bring back information which explored utility and risks of RPAS operation in Antarctica. 
RPAS are used as a tool by the national Antarctic programs in support of science, logistics and operations. They are low-cost platforms that can dramatically reduce the use of personned aircraft and thereby reduce the use of fossil fuels in the Antarctic Treaty area. The RPAS in use today are typically electrically powered, are low decibel and reduce environmental impact from activities that would otherwise be carried out using personned aircraft.

Since the 2014 ATCM/CEP request, COMNAP has presented the following to the ATCM and CEP:
    • ATCM XXXVIII/CEP XVIII (2015) WP022 UAV Use in Antarctica – Risks and Benefits
    • ATCM XXXIX/CEPXIX (2016) WP014 The COMNAP Unmanned Aerial Systems Working Group (UAS-WG) that included the Antarctic UAS Operator’s Handbook (version 31 March 2016)
    •  ATCM XL/CEP XX (2017) IP077 Update from the COMNAP Unmanned Aerial Systems Working Group (UAS-WG) that included a survey of national Antarctic programs on their UAS use for the period 1 April 2016 through 31 March 2017
    • ATCM XLI/CEP XXI (2018) IP043 COMNAP Antarctic RPA Operator’s Handbook (version 27 November 2017).

COMNAP produced and continues to update and improve the “Antarctic Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) Operator’s Handbook” through the COMNAP RPA-WG relying on peer-reviewed publications, best practice and monitoring of international standards and operating procedures while recognizing the special environmental considerations related to the Antarctic Treaty area. COMNAP Members continue to utilize RPA in the Antarctic Treaty area of a range of uses, especially in support of scientific activities. At the COMNAP Annual General Meetings, through the Regional Break-out Group’s Exchange of Information, national Antarctic programs are informally asked to share information on any planned use of RPAs for the upcoming Antarctic season. Sixteen of the national Antarctic programs indicated they would be deploying at least one RPA in the 2017/18 Antarctic summer season.  This is a slight decrease in RPA activity as compared with the results of the formal COMNAP survey of Members for the 2016/17 season.31 . The relatively low cost of purchase, deployment and operation of RPAs meant we saw an initial high uptake of the technology within national Antarctic programs a few seasons ago, this appears to be steady.
2.2 Balloons
While out-of-scope of this document, we also would like to note the increase in balloon launches in support of science activity.  For example, the Year of Polar Prediction in the Southern Hemisphere (YOPP-SH) organized a Special Observing Period that many national Antarctic programs participated in, that took place in the Antarctic from 18 November 2018 through 15 February 2019.  During this three-month period, there were 2116 additional radiosonde balloon launches confirmed32 to take place across the Antarctic.
3.1 Conclusions
3.1.1 Air activities vital. Inter-continental and intra-continental flight activities are vital to the success of national Antarctic programs for operations, logistics (moving of people and cargo) and for science.  Aviation logistics flights move personnel and supplies safely and efficiently throughout Antarctica and provide access to otherwise inaccessible areas of the continent.  Several aircraft fly exclusively on science missions and perform aerial surveys to collect data that can only be completed with specially equipped aircraft. 
3.1.2 Advance information share important. It is important to share information of all proposed air operations in advance in order to de-conflict active airspace and to ensure that any alternative landing sites33 are aware that they may be used as an alternative or back-up in an emergency situation. A best practice would be for all pilots operating in the Antarctic to communicate before flight with the agency managing any possible emergency landing site prior to flight so that the agency is aware of the possibility of a divert to that airfield.  
3.1.3 Accurate and timely data share critical. The importance of up-to-date and accurate data and information in relation to facilities, including those related to air operations remains vital. COMNAP products such as AFIM, the COMNAP Facilities List and the ATOM are only as good as the data that populates the database.  When checking information, differences have been noted between the various sources of data such as between the COMNAP database and the ATS Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES).
3.1.4 Air traffic now steady. Generally, since 1995 we do see an increase in total inter-continental flights to Antarctica, with the last three Antarctic seasons that we have data for indicating that total overall inter-continental air traffic is now steady. We note, however, that the recent COMNAP Antarctic Roadmap Challenges (ARC) project concluded that “…future science requirements critically depend on an expansion of intra-Antarctic flights and ground-traversing capabilities, including expanding into under-studied but scientifically interesting regions.”34 
3.1.5 Decrease in fixed-wing, increase in rotary-wing. There is a decrease in the total number of personned fixed-wing aircraft in operation in support of Antarctic activity. This is likely due to increased international collaboration and agreements on co-operative arrangements. There is, however, an increase in rotary-wing aircraft in operation. This is not only the case within national Antarctic programs, but requests to COMNAP from NGOs signalling they will be operating helicopters from vessels has increased in the past several years. 
3.1.6 Expansion across year. There is expansion to the tradition times of year of aircraft operation.  This may further increase as weather and environmental conditions around the Antarctic change and with changing science demands. The changing nature of sea-ice is likely to also impact the sea-ice runways. Understanding sea-ice trends is important for several aspects of national Antarctic programs’ operations, but complicated. 35 We could see a shortening of the usable period of availability of these that will likely create interest in establishment of more land-ice or hard rock/gravel runways; Alternatively, changes in sea-ice in some areas may open up new air operations capabilities.
3.1.7 Emergency response may increasingly be called upon. Any increase in air activity brings with it increased risks that must be managed or mitigated, and in cases of SAR or emergency it is the national Antarctic programs that are often called upon to respond.
3.1.8 Application of technological advances. Technology advances will continue to support safe and effective air operations in Antarctica for personned aircraft and RPAS. For RPAS, innovative technology have  introduced RPAS that allow for data collection, reconnaissance and other activities in a safe and environmentally friendly manner, replacing in many cases the use of personned aircraft. For personned aircraft, new anti-collision devices are readily available and many jurisdictions outside of the Antarctic will require all aircraft operating in their airspace to incorporate such technologies (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and TCAS, for examples). Installation and use of such anti-collision devices should be strongly encouraged for all air operators in Antarctica. 
Annex A: History of ATCM discussions on Aviation Safety in Antarctica36 

The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) II in Buenos Aires, Argentina (July 1962), agreed Recommendation II-V “Meeting of Expert on Logistics” that stated: “a meeting or symposium of experts should be held, to review the present state of knowledge acquired on the organization of expeditions, logistic support and transport, in order to evaluate such knowledge;”
Symposium on Antarctic Logistics, Boulder, Colorado, USA (August 1962), under the auspices of the Working Group on Logistics of SCAR, included Section II Air Operations. The Final Report from that meeting summarizes as point 4.3 (pg 755): “The main point raised during the discussion was the following: The ability to fly to the continent is probably the largest factor in the whole operation of science in Antarctica.”  Pages 757-760 provide the report on the discussion summary.
The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) III (1964), Brussels, Belgium, agreed Recommendation III-1 “Information Exchange on Airfield Facilities”.
The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) IV (1966), Santiago, Chile, agreed Recommendation IV-25 “Meeting on Logistics” that would be held in Japan in June 1968.  The meeting would be attended by experts in selected fields. The fields for discussion included “Air transport, including airfields”. The Third Symposium on Antarctic Logistics, Leningrad, USSR (June/July 1982), under the auspices of the Working Group on Logistics of SCAR, included Section III Transport.
The Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Logistics, June 1968, Tokyo, Japan, included the agenda items “Air transport, including airfields” and “Special and Future Support Projects” which also had a focus on air activity in support of future Antarctic scientific research. See for example, the paper by Dr Gordon Robin, UK Alternate Representative and Director of the Scott Polar Research Institute.
Recommendation VII-8 (1972) “Cooperation in Transport” recognised that the relative inaccessibility of many regions of the Antarctic Treaty Area creates special transport problems; and Recommends to Governments that, inter alia, “They accept the principle of using, where appropriate, common transport facilities by sea and by air for scientific and other personnel proceeding with their equipment to and from Antarctic stations; They encourage bilateral or multilateral consultations between Contracting Parties in order to establish when arrangements for such common use of transport facilities would be mutually convenient and practicable;”. 
The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) XIV in Rio de Janeiro (1987) recognized the importance of safe air operations (Final Report ATCM XIV, para 147-150) in the Antarctic and adopted Recommendation XIV - 9 “Air Safety” - “Meeting of Experts”. This Recommendation defined the terms of reference for the expert meeting.
The Meeting of Experts on Air Safety in Antarctica took place in Paris from 2 to 5 May 1989 and delivered its report to the ATCM XV in Paris in 1989. The Meeting discussed this report (Final Report ATCM XV, para 168-169) and adopted Recommendation XV-20, which contained ten specific proposals relating to air safety. 
At ATCM XVI in Bonn (1991), the topic of improving air safety in Antarctica was discussed in detail by the Meeting (Final Report ATCM XVI, para 129-133). COMNAP reported that, as recommended by the ATCM in Recommendation XV-20 (Paris, 1989), it had published the Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM), a handbook of aeronautical information, as a tool towards safe air operations in Antarctica. It was proposed “that adequate measures should be taken to set up regulations with a view to the use of air space, to traffic control and a system of air safety based on ICAO principles and the special conditions of the Antarctic. It was further noted that COMNAP and SCAR should continue their work in this field.”
AT ATCM XVII, an Information Paper was presented by Chile (ATCM XVII/INFO 66) related to the meeting of a panel on Air Safety in the Antarctic Peninsula Region, which was held Chile in October 1992, in accordance with the proposal by the SCALOP Sub-Group on Air Safety in Antarctica (Final Report ATCM XVII, para 129-130).
The COMNAP SCALOP Workshop on Antarctic Air Transport Networks, 19-21 April 1995, Washington, DC, USA.
At ATCM XXXII in Baltimore (2009) (Final Report ATCM XXXII, Vol. 2), COMNAP informed that an in-depth review of the AFIM was under way as one of COMNAP's 2008-2009 strategic projects, following the presentation of a comprehensive discussion paper at COMNAP XX (St Petersburg, 2008).
Aspects covered by the review included:
    • the structure of the information and its relation to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) formats and standards;
    • the management of the updating and publishing process;
    • suitability to the needs and requirements of its various users – including pilots, station personnel, managers and Search and Rescue authorities;
    • implementation of a parallel electronic version of the AFIM.

At ATCM XXXV in Hobart (2012) (Final Report Vol II, page 201), COMNAP reported that the “in-depth review of the AFIM has resulted in a wish to deliver the AFIM in electronic format. The AFIM will continue to be updated via information from National Antarctic Programs and revisions will be regularly prepared and distributed.”
At ATCM XXXVI in Brussels (2013) (Final Report, para 37 and 38), the Meeting noted that Recommendation XV-20 (1989) on Air Safety in Antarctica should be updated, and the Meeting adopted Resolution 1 (2013) Air Safety in Antarctica.
AT ATCM XXXVII in Brasilia (2014) (Final Report, para 187) and ATCM XXXVIII in Sofia (2015) (Final Report, para 187) COMNAP provided progress updates on the reformatting of the Antarctic Flight Information Manual (AFIM) as an exclusively digital product.
The ATCM XXXVII requested the Secretariat to extend special invitations to ICAO as Expert to ATCM XXXVIII, Sofia, and to ATCM XXXIX, Santiago de Chile, to present its view on air safety issues. ATCM XXXIX requested the Secretariat to write to ICAO to advise it of ATCM concerns about air safety in Antarctica and to invite them to present their views for discussion at ATCM XL (Final Report, page 311, Multi-Year Strategic Work Plan).
