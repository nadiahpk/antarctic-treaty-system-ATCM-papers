Report of the 2018/2019 summer campaign of the joint monitoring programme of non-native flies in King George Island / Isla 25 de Mayo
Information Paper submitted by Uruguay, the Republic of Korea, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Germany and the Russian Federation
Summary
In the Antarctic summer 2017/2018, a joint non-native flies monitoring programme in King George Island/ Isla 25 de Mayo was initiated. Currently, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and Uruguay are making coordinated efforts to collect relevant data on the presence of the non-native fly Trichocera maculipennis within their stations and surroundings areas to support management actions to control it. The purpose of this document is to update the information generated so far in the framework of this joint monitoring programme.
Background
Until recently the Antarctic continent and Peninsula have been little impacted by non-native species, compared to other regions of the Earth. However, reports of species introductions are increasing as awareness of biological invasions as a major conservation threat, has grown within the Antarctic community (ATCM XXXVIII – IP46; Newman et al., 2014; Hughes & Frenot, 2015; Hughes et al., 2019). While most Antarctic non-native species have been found in the natural environment, non-native species have also established populations within Antarctic buildings, sewage treatment plants and hydroponic facilities (ATCM XXXVIII – IP 46; ATCM XXIX- IP 72; Hughes et al., 2005). 
The CEP Non-native Species Manual recommends, as a key guiding principle, that ‘to be effective, responses to introductions should be undertaken as a priority, to prevent an increase in the species’ distribution range and to make eradication simpler, cost effective and more likely to succeed’. Therefore, the successful management of non-native species, including those within station buildings, should be a priority.
Within the past decade there have been reports of sewage treatment plant infestations by the boreal trichocerid fly Trichocera maculipennis at research stations around Maxwell/Guardia Nacional Bay, King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo, all of which lie within 10 km of one another (ATCM XXXIX – WP52). 
As the first step of a co-ordinated international response to manage this non-native fly (NNF), in 2016 most of the overwintering stations on King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo checked their station buildings, facilities, and surrounding areas in response to the survey entitled ‘A short questionnaire on Non-native Flies at Antarctic Stations’. Based on the findings of this survey, the Republic of Korea, Uruguay, Chile, and the United Kingdom recommend that the CEP: (1) continues to encourage Parties with stations on King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo to check their facilities for non-native flies and to undertake both continuous and periodic monitoring to indicate, if there are any non-native flies inhabiting the environment; (2) encourages the Parties to jointly develop co-ordinated standardized monitoring and eradication programmes to effectively control the spread of the flies, and join the collaborative research project; and (3) asks COMNAP to play a central role in sharing information and best practices between Parties and other stakeholders (ATCM XL – WP26). According to that survey, T. maculipennis had been recorded within or in the surroundings of the following stations: Artigas, Arctowski, Escudero, Frei, Fildes and King Sejong, without further confirmation of the presence or absence of the species in the other stations of King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo. 
In the Antarctic summer season 2017/2018 Uruguay, the Republic of Korea, Chile and the Russian Federation started a pilot monitoring programme with support from Germany, to track and avoid the expansion of T. maculipennis in King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo (ATCM XLI – IP50). The coordinated actions implemented were installation of 1) adhesive traps inside the facilities (Artigas, Bellingshausen, Fildes and King Sejong stations) to identify population trends throughout the year, and 2) pitfall traps in the surroundings of Artigas and King Sejong stations during the summer season to assess the presence of the species beyond the limits of these stations.
Updating information about the monitoring programme
In the Antarctic summer 2018/2019 Argentina, Brazil and China joined the monitoring programme. At present, adhesive traps remain installed in Artigas, Bellingshausen, Carlini, Escudero, Ferraz, Great Wall and King Sejong stations. During the summer season, pitfall traps were installed in the surroundings of Peninsula Fildes stations and water samples of several lakes were taken to perform analyses using environmental DNA techniques. Genetic analyses were also performed to assess population structure from individuals collected in Artigas, Escudero and King Sejong stations.

Tables 1 and 2 show the sampling effort and the total numbers of specimens captured during the summer seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19 in each station. The sampling effort was defined as the number of traps installed multiplied by the number of days these traps remained active.

* Arctowski Station has its own monitoring programme (Potocka & Krzeminska, 2018)
** Data not yet available.

During 2018/2019 season, KOPRI carried out a developmental experiment of NNF in the laboratory and in the lake near King Sejong Station. Surprisingly, the NNF’s eggs hatched and developed to larvae, showing conditional adaptation in both environments, suggesting that NNF population can survive in the field if the environmental conditions are favourable. In addition, molecular analyses are being conducted to assess population structure among Escudero, Artigas and King Sejong stations. The preliminary results suggest the spreading and establishment of the species is taking place among stations in King George Island.
Conclusions, on-going activities and next steps
Results so far suggest the species is widespread across research stations in King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo, with presence still unconfirmed in Ferraz, and Machu Picchu. The evidence so far indicates that the species has not spread to the area of Carlini Station. Records in and around Escudero and Bellingshausen shows the species is present in the vicinity of all research stations in Fildes Peninsula, as well as Barton Peninsula. It is striking the high number of individuals reported for Artigas Station from the adhesive-trap sampling. However, it should be noted that 91% of the catches occurred in a single trap, located in the sewage system. Knowing that the species has the capacity to develop its entire life cycle in the stations sewage system (Volonterio et al., 2013, Potocka & Krzeminska, 2018) reported numbers might be largely influenced by the location where traps were installed in the stations. To be sure there are no biases in the results, all stations must ensure that at least some traps are located in the sewage system.

It is also worthy to note that the use of adhesive traps as a monitoring tool also constitutes a control measure, as these traps remove individuals from the population. Table 1 shows how in Artigas Station the capture per sampling effort decreased to a third from one season to the other, without any other control measure. In addition, at the end of the 2018/19 summer season UV light traps were installed in Artigas, Bellingshausen, Escudero and King Sejong stations to evaluate their effectiveness as a population control measure.

On-going activities include the following actions:
    • Adhesive trap data are currently being processed to identify population trends throughout the year. In order to increase the accuracy of results, there is a need to further standardize sampling effort in the next summer season. 
    • KOPRI has developed 12 markers of polymorphic microsatellites in the population of T. maniculipennis from King Sejong Station. To investigate whether the presence of the species is mainly linked to the human movement among the stations, maritime movement (supplies by ship/aircraft), or natural dispersals more samples from the different stations in the island are needed.
    • Analyses using environmental DNA techniques are underway to assess the presence of T. maculipennis in the surrounding of stations on Barton and Fildes Peninsula.
    • UV light traps are being tested as control measures in Artigas, Bellingshausen, Escudero and King Sejong stations. Considering the efficiency of short-term eradication tests, UV trap is so far the most effective control measure identified. KOPRI is willing to provide free traps to those stations interested in installing UV traps.
    • In 2018 Uruguayan researchers were granted a SCAR Fellowship to develop a management plan for Trichocera maculipennis in King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo. For the 2019/2020 summer season they expect to have a first draft of the plan, and start its implementation in Artigas station and any other station willing to implement it.

For the next season it is expected to extend the monitoring programme to all the stations in King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo. Recently, Peru confirmed their interest in the participation of the Machu Picchu Station in the next Antarctic summer. Data on population trend throughout the year, and results of the control measures using UV traps and the genetic analyses will hopefully provide a better picture of the extent of the problem, and means to tackle it. So far, results are encouraging in terms of the willingness of the National Antarctic Programmes with facilities in the island, to act in coordination.
