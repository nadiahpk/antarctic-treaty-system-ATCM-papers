Information Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Summary

Information about an Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly, to be hosted by the United Kingdom Parliament’s All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Polar Regions, in London on 2-3 December 2019.

Background

    1. Within the UK Parliament, All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) are informal cross-party groups run by and for members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  The APPG for the Polar Regions aims to inform parliamentarians on all matters relating to the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and is chaired by James Gray MP.

    2. The APPG for the Polar Regions is keen to engage with international parliamentarians with an interest in Antarctica.  They have therefore decided to host an Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly in London on 2-3 December 2019, to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Antarctic Treaty. 

Details of the Conference

    3. The aim of the Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly is to bring together members of the national legislatures of Treaty Parties to raise awareness of the Antarctic Treaty System, discuss current topical Antarctic issues and to consider what parliamentarians could do to support the Treaty System and to promote peace, science and environmental protection.  

    4. The Assembly is open for participation by parliamentarians from all Antarctic Treaty Parties.  Further information is set out in the attached flyer, which the UK hopes ATCM colleagues will be able to make available to eligible participants.
