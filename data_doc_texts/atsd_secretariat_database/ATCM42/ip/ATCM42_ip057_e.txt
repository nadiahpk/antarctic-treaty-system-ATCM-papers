Bulgaria-Turkey Scientific Collaboration

Within the scope of 27th Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition (BAE) and the 3th Turkish Antarctic Expedition (TAE), a collaborative research between Bulgarian Antarctic Institute and Istanbul Technical University, were successfully completed.

Prof. Dr. Şafak Altunkaynak conducted a research project titled “Tracking the evolution of a magmatic arc on the plutonic and volcanic complexes of Livingston Island (South Shetland Archipelago, Antarctica)”. Between January 17 and March 2, 2019, geological field studies have been done in the Livingston Island hosted by St. Kliment Ohridski Bulgarian Antarctic Base. Prof. Dr. Altunkaynak’s fieldwork with the support of Bulgarian geological team (Dr. Stefan Velev, Dr. Kamen Bonev and Prof. Dr. Christo Pimpirev,) was successfully completed. 

At the same time, between February 7 and March 2, 2019 Dr. Stefan Velev joined the 3thTurkish Scientific Expedition (TAE-III) to work on a project titled “Geological investigations on Horseshoe Island, Antarctica”. 

It was a mutual pleasure to work together during last summer and we hope that this successful collaboration will continue in the future years.
