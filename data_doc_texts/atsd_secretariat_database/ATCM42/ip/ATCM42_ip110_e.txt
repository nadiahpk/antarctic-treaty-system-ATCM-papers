Russian hydrographic studies in the Antarctic in the season 2019–2020
Information Paper submitted by the Russian Federation
In commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the South Polar continent by the Russian Navy expedition on the sloops “Vostok” and “Mirny”, which took place in the end of January 1820, the Main Headquarters of the Russian Federation Navy plans to carry out hydrographic and oceanographic studies in the Antarctic onboard their specialized oceanographic research vessels. These are the “Admiral Vladimirsky” (the Baltic fleet), the “Yantar” (Northern fleet) and the “Marshal Gelovani” (the Pacific Ocean fleet).
At the transits to the area of the Antarctic studies all three ships will carry out research programs in the water areas of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.
The Hydrographic Service of the Navy of Russia for more than 190 years from the time of its establishment in 1827 is traditionally responsible for safety of shipping of the Russian vessels in the water areas of the World Ocean, regardless of their departmental subordination. With this purpose specialized hydrographic organizations of the Navy of Russia deal with the development and publication of all sea charts and navigation aids.
The first Soviet hydrographic editions were made by the Central Cartographic Enterprise 280 of the Navy of Russia in 1957 upon the end of the work of the First Complex Expedition of the USSR Academy of Science and were further annually supplemented by the new hydrographic, oceanographic, geomagnetic and meteorological information after the end of the next Soviet (Russian) Antarctic Expeditions.
The USSR (Russian Federation) joined in 1976 the membership in the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), created in 1921 and continues its active efforts on the issues of knowledge of the water area of the global ocean and solution of practical objectives of navigation safety. From the beginning of its acceding to the IHO, Russia is represented in this international organization by the Administration of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry for Defense of the USSR (Russian Federation). Hydrographic studies and work in the Antarctic have been carried out as a rule by specialized groups of naval hydrographers working onboard the expedition research ships of the Antarctic Program of the USSR (Russian Federation) and in the coastal marine water areas of location of the Soviet (Russian) Antarctic stations. In some cases such activities were expanded by involving for these purposes specialized oceanographic research vessels of the Hydrographic Service of the Navy of Russia. The most large-scale hydrographic studies with assistance of the ships of the USSR (Russia) Navy were carried out in the summer seasons of 1967–1968, 1982–1983 and 2015–2016. 
Research activity of the oceanographic research vessels “Admiral Vladimirsky”, “Yantar” and “Marshal Gelovani”
The departure of the “Admiral Vladimirsky”, “Yantar” and “Marshal Gelovani” from their shore ports (St. Petersburg, Olenogorsk and Vladivostok, respectively) is planned for November 2019. In the middle of January 2020 all three vessels will enter the Antarctic Treaty area (parallel 600 S) across waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and in the end of January 2020, they should meet in the vicinity of Waterloo Island (King George), on which the Russian Antarctic station Bellingshausen is located to participate in the planned celebrations on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of discovery of the South polar continent. After these events the “Admiral Vladimirsky” and the “Marshal Gelovani” will depart for performing depth measurements in the framework of hydrographic activities in the area of the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas with en-route oceanographic, meteorological and geomagnetic studies. This region of hydrographic research (navigation sea chart INT9172) is designated by the IHO for the Russian Federation. Planned hydrographic depth measurement studies of seabed relief structure refer to the category of general hydrographic survey and are performed at the scale of 1:500000. The track line spacing of the survey is 10 km. The direction of track lines is constructed perpendicular to the general direction of isobaths. The depth measurements are carried out by means of multi-beam echo-sounders and echo-sounder-profilers of different depth ranges. The geographical linking of the position of ships is made by means of the satellite navigation system GLONASS.
Upon the end of the depth measurements it is planned to perform studies on the exact determination of location of the South magnetic pole. The last time its location was determined in 2012, when the point was at coordinates of 64°24' S, 137°06' E. After finishing this work both ships will leave the Antarctic Treaty Area and will start to perform programs of their studies in the water areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
After visiting Bellingshausen station the oceanographic research vessel “Yantar” will carry out special oceanographic and ecological studies in Bransfield Strait, focusing on the area of the sunken ship “Explorer” (Liberia). This event occurred on 23 November in 2007 after collision with an iceberg in 25 km to the southeast of King George Island (coordinates of 62°23' S.; 57°16,6' W). The depth at the ship wreck place is about 1300 m. As is known, there was more than 150 tons of IFO onboard the M/V “Explorer” at the moment of collision with an iceberg. The “Yantar” is equipped with the most advanced deep water underwater devices, by means of which one can not only perform a video-survey of the place of the wreck, but also collect soil and water samples from the near-bottom layer for subsequent analyses for the pollution by hydrocarbons. The necessary chemical analysis of the collected water and soil samples will be performed at specialized ship laboratories onboard the “Yantar”. After the end of these operations the oceanographic research vessel “Yantar” will leave the Antarctic Treaty Area and will continue her studies in the Atlantic Ocean. Let us add that the “Yantar” was dispatched by the Main Headquarters of the Navy of Russia to the South Atlantic for search of the diesel-electric submarine “San Juan” of the Navy of Argentina sunk on 15 November 2017 and carried out search operations along its navigation route.
The total duration of operations of the vessels “Admiral Vladimirsky”, the “Marshal Gelovani” and the “Yantar” will be not more than 40 days.

Justification for work performance
The work program on the hydrographic, oceanographic, meteorological and geomagnetic study of Antarctic waters by means of the oceanographic research vessels the “Admiral Vladimirsky”, the “Marshal Gelovani” and the “Yantar” is approved by Commander in Chief of the Navy of the Russian Federation and is structurally in the work program of the 65th seasonal Russian Antarctic Expedition. 
Environmental Impact Assessment will be prepared. Information on the work performed in the Antarctic will be reported to the international Antarctic community at ATCM XLIII.
