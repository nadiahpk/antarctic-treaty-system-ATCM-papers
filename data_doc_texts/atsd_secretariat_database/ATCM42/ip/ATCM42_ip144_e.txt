IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM)

An Information Paper Submitted by the 
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)


Summary
The IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM) is a core document for all IAATO operators to enable the practical application of IAATO’s mission of safe and environmentally responsible tourism to Antarctica. Updated and circulated annually to IAATO operators, the FOM provides all relevant international governance, including ATCM instruments as well as IAATO requirements, guidelines, standard operating procedures and other industry best practice.  ATCMXLII WP51 Compiling a manual on tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica sets out the principles and goals for developing a Treaty Party approved manual that compiles current provisions and guidelines governing tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic. IAATO sees significant parallels with its Field Operations Manual. Recognising the benefits of having information related to tourism activities collated in one place for competent authorities, IAATO will continue to provide any of the Competent Authorities and Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with the annually updated FOM, if requested to do so. 

Background
In order to fulfil the practical implementation of IAATO’s mission, safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to Antarctica, one of the most important roles for IAATO is to ensure all the latest, relevant information is easily available to operators ranging from international requirements, guidelines, standard operating procedures and industry best practice. The core method for delivering this information is the IAATO Field Operations Manual (FOM) first created in 2008-09 (see ATCM XXXII IP087 IAATO Field Operations Manual). Before the FOM, IAATO Operators created custom in-house manuals incorporating ATS and IAATO guidelines and procedures, as well as their own standard operating procedures.  These custom manuals, now integrated with the FOM, are still part of Operator procedures.  Since its inception, the FOM has been updated annually to incorporate new guidelines, standard operating procedures and decisions by IAATO, ATCM, COMNAP and other relevant bodies, such as International Maritime Organization, International Hydrographic Organization, etc. 
How the FOM works:
Due to the dynamic nature of field operations and the level of detail required, the IAATO FOM is a fully electronic manual. Prior to each Antarctic operating cycle, the FOM is overhauled, updated and made available online to IAATO members. In addition to updating the Operators on requirements, guidelines and standard operating procedures, the FOM also serves as the curriculum of the annual IAATO online Field Staff Assessment. During the season, additional electronic updates to the FOM are sent to Operators to ensure that the latest information is circulated in a timely manner. 
While resource intensive to set up and maintain, the FOM is essential to ensuring that all Operators and their field staff know what is required of them and have easy access to critical information.  The FOM also serves as a guide to a plethora of additional resources. For an overview of information contained in the IAATO FOM, please see the electronic site map listed in Appendix 1. 
Additionally, in 2016, IAATO launched a slimmed-down version of the FOM through an application called IAATO Polar Guide: Antarctica that is publicly available for download for Android and iOS (see ATCM XLII IP 98 Education and Outreach by IAATO – an update for 2019). 
IAATO has made the FOM available to Competent Authorities annually since its inception. Noting that ATCM XLII WP51 Compiling a manual on tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica sets out the principles and goals for developing a Treaty Party approved manual that compiles current provisions and guidelines governing tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic, IAATO sees significant parallels with its own Field Operations Manual. Recognising the benefits of having information related to tourism activities collated in one place for competent authorities, IAATO will continue to provide Competent Authorities and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat with the annually updated FOM, if requested to do so.
