Recent Romanian Antarctic Education and Outreach activities
Information Paper submitted by Romania

Summary
Romania developed last years, under the coordination of National Commission for Antarctic Research (NCAR) of the Romanian Academy, various Antarctic Education and Outreach (E&O) programs. Antarctic information was communicated to the Romanian scientific community and decision factors, also valorizing Antarctica Day and Polar Week programs. Romania participated in the ATCM E&O ICGs 2016-2019. The Romanian explorer team ROICE of National R&D Institute for Biological Sciences informed on its cooperation with the Korean KOPRI Institute. A special program was dedicated to the celebration of the Romanian scientist Emil Racovita (1868–1947), the first biologist in the world who studied life in Antarctica in Belgica Expedition and the founder of biospeleology. Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs celebrated 50 years of bilateral diplomatic relations with Australia, by an event highlighting the Romanian-Australian cooperation in Antarctica at the Law-Racovita Base in Larsemann Hills. NCAR coordinated an Antarctic E&O national contest of artistic productions. 
Romania developed last years under the coordination of National Commission for Antarctic Research (NCAR) of Romanian Academy (RA) various Antarctic Education and Outreach (E&O) programs. Antarctic scientific and environmental information has been communicated to the Romanian scientific community and decision factors, also valorizing the international polar E&O programs to disseminate this information to all the national education system levels, as well as to the general public. 
The NCAR observed the recommendations of the ATCM and the respective ATCM ICGs on E&O by communicating and/or making available the Antarctic information, also including the Antarctic Treaty System matters (ATCM and CEP, the Santiago Declaration 2016), by numerous Notes, prepared by the NCAR E&O Groupe and sent by e-mail to the NCAR members.

Since 2016, Romania participated in the ATCM E&O ICGs activities on the ATCM Discussion Forum, anualy reporting on the national programs, events and on the Antarctic information published or disseminated by media. Participation of Romania in the 2018-2019 ICG  is recorded by the ICG E&O Core Group in the ATCM XLII WP033 (Bulgaria, Belgia, Brazilia, Chile, Portugalia, Spania, Marea Britanie): Third report of the Intersessional Contact Group on Education and Outreach (ATCM XLII Agenda Item 11: Education Issues). 
During 2017–2019, Romania, by RA (including NCAR), the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Romania and various research and education institutions, developed a complex program of activities dedicated to the celebration of 150 years since the birth of the Romanian scholar Emil Racovita (1868–1947), the first biologist in the world who studied life in Antarctica within the first international expedition for scientific purposes  („Belgica” 1897-1899), the founder of biospeleology and of the first Biospaeleology Institute in the world, in Cluj (1920). The personality of Emil Racovita has been presented to large audiences, within academic or education institutions, Romanian Academy included, also in the context of celebrating the Centennial of the Romanian Great Union (December First 1918 - 2018). 
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized with support from NCAR on October 8, 2018 a special event on the occasion of the visit to Bucharest of a delegation of the Australian Federal Parliament, including the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Australia to Romania, thus celebrating 50 years (1968-2018) of bilateral diplomatic relations between Romania and Australia, and also 150 years since the birth of Emil RACOVIŢĂ (1868-1947), in honor of which the Australian Law Base in Antarctica was renamed Law-Racovita on June 15, 2005, respectively Law-Racovita-Negoita on 09.12.2011. A documentary-scientific and artistic exhibition on the cooperation of the two Parties in Antarctica, based on a ten-years (2005-2015) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the joint use of Law-Racovita Base in Larsemann Hills, has been presented. The exhibition also highlighted the contributions of the explorers Phillip Garth LAW (1912-2010) in Australia and Teodor Gheorghe NEGOIŢĂ (1946-2011) in Romania to ensuring national commitment to Antarctica and the development of Antarctic sciences. This event is described in detail by ATCM XLII IP 161, Agenda item 15 submitted by Romania.

Romanian Antarctic explorer team ROICE of the National R&D Institute for Biological Sciences (NRDIBS) communicated by various means their experience and results from the scientific cooperation with the Korean KOPRI Institute at the King Sejong Station in West Antarctica, based on a five-years cooperation agreement. (http://www.roice.ro/expeditii/expeditia-roice-2015/). The members of ROICE expeditions 2015, 2016, and 2018, along with their KOPRI collaborators, under the coordination of Dr. Manuela Sidoroff, the General Manager of NRDIBS, published, as a homage to Emil Racovita, an album entitled “In the Footsteps of the Giants”, edited by Romanian Academy Publishing House, including photographs and impressions of ROICE members.

”Stefan S. Nicolau” Institute of Virology of RA, Bucharest, organized in 2017-2019 a series of Antarctic E&O events, coordinated by Dr. Florica Toparceanu, Antarctic explorer and CEP National Contact Point. Antarctic researches on the human health and physiology under extreme conditions, and the theme of viruses in some lakes in West Antarctica have been discussed.

Romania (under the coordination of NCAR) organized each year the E&O national program  Antarctica Day, also considering that Romania is the only Party in the Antarctic Treaty celebrating its National Day on December First, the International Antarctica Day. The respective programs have been reported on the ATCM ICG for E&O Discussion Forum 2016-2019. An increased number of institutions and participants have been involved in this program, and a broad  variety of communicating means was recorded. 
Romania considered the Polar Week programs, involving education system institutions, e.g. the Scientific Seminary of the Ovidius University, Constanta, dedicated to the International Polar Week in March 27, 2018, or the national program „Another kind of school” involving gymnasium and highschool pupils and teachers.

The NCAR E&O Group prepared in 2018 a synthesis on the position of Romania related to the Antarctic tourism issue, as it was expressed within the ATCM-CEP meetings (2000-2002), and of the Romanian intersessional activities (2006-2008) on the same subject (e.g. establishing steps of Antarctic environmental protection also valid in case of tourism), in response of a request from the Association for the United Nations in the Argentine Republic (ANU-AR). The Romanian Embassy in Argentina requested this information in view of a proper representation of a Romanian delegation within a simulation event organized by ANU-AR. Romania is not a member of IAATO and does not have Antarctic tour-operators.

NCAR organized the National Contest of Essays and other Artistic Productions on Polar Themes within the Program „Do know and protect Antarctica!”, 2018, structured on five sections for the themes proposed, i.e. “Celebration of Emil Racovita Year 2018”; “20 Years of continuous activity of Romania in the Antarctic Treaty (1998-2018)”; “10 Years since Romania has been admitted to SCAR (14.07.2008)” ; Wildlife in the Polar Regions”; and “Protection of the Polar Environment”. The contest involved a great number of participants and events at all education system levels. Kindergarten children represented by their specific means the polar wildlife and the explorers protecting the environment, also building a model for a future Romanian Antarctic station. Romania is willing to participate in some international E&O programs that should also consider artistic means in support of Antarctic E&O purposes.

Syntheses of most of the a.m. activities, mentioning the respective links, have been posted by Romania on the ATCM Discussion Forum 2016-2019, the ICG E&O section.
