The conception of the new State Research Program in Antarctica                 for 2021-2030 
Information Paper submitted by Ukraine
Summary
The current State Research Program in Antarctica for 2011-2020 will be revised for the next period of 2021-2030 with subject to national science objectives, SCAR priorities, as well as the main outcomes of intersessional discussions, convened by Australia, on future Antarctic science challenges. This paper reports on the main research areas and possibilities of strengthening international scientific cooperation in the frame of the conception of the new Ukrainian Research Program in Antarctica for 2021-2030, which are currently under procedure of domestic adjustment in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine.
The purpose of the Program
The purpose of the Program is to provide monitoring, fundamental and applied research in Antarctica as the main element of the implementation of state policy in the region to strengthen the role of Ukraine as a Consultative Party to the Antarctic Treaty, strengthen national security, ensure the long-term political, socio-economic and environmental interests of Ukraine in Antarctica.
Priority research topics
Considering the interdisciplinary nature of scientific issues related to actual issues of Antarctic studies and the global significance for all mankind, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive research projects on the following priority topics:
1) studies of the global interaction of the Antarctic atmosphere, its ice sheet and water masses of the Southern Ocean in connection with changes in the Earth’s climate;
2) studies of the fundamental laws of the geological structure, deep structure and history of the formation of the Earth's crust of Antarctica, its continental margin and adjacent deep-water areas of the Southern Ocean for the assessment and scientific forecast of the mineral potential of the Antarctic;
3) studies of the evolution of marine and terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems and their adaptation to the effects of extreme environmental factors, as well as studies of Antarctic living organisms with valuable biological properties as a source of genetic and biochemical resources;
4) studies of the interaction of atmospheric and space weather systems, including the use of Earth remote sensing spacecraft (ERS), improvement of the Earth remote sensing technologies and improvement of the quality of Antarctic observations;
5) participation in the development of integrated environmental planning in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, the establishment of protected areas for the conservation of typical Antarctic biotopes and rare species, ensuring sustainable (non-exhausting) development of human activities in the region.
Ways to perform research projects of the Program
1. Carrying out year-round monitoring of environmental parameters at all levels of the geosphere – from the lithosphere to the geospace (meteorological, ozonometric, ionospheric, magnetospheric, seismological observations, etc.) and original (experimental) studies directly at Vernadsky station.
2. Conducting annual seasonal research in the area of ​​Vernadsky station, in particular annual monitoring studies of microbiome, soil, plants and animals on land and marine biogeographic landfills, with the gradual expansion of the region of works (expeditionary research in the western part of the Antarctic Peninsula, in the East Antarctica, in the interior regions of the continent, as well as the annual research during the Antarctic research vessel voyage).
3. Performing experimental studies in leading university and academic laboratories of Ukraine in the framework of scientific and technical projects using primary data, samples and materials obtained during expeditionary research.
In general, the implementation of comprehensive research in Antarctica will increase the number of field research projects in the program of works of Ukrainian Antarctic expeditions, and this will lead to an increase in the number of publications on the results of scientific observations in international peer-reviewed editions.
Opportunities for international scientific cooperation at Vernadsky station
Vernadsky station is a year-round and well equipped station to carry out interdisciplinary research in the field of ionospheric sensing, meteorological and magnetometric observations, studying the ozone layer and the electromagnetic processes in the environment, seismic acoustic observations.
Vernadsky station is a unique geophysical observatory and an important reference point of the long-term research in the Antarctic region. A special location allows the station to study the complex environmental processes and to thoroughly monitor their changes.
In the spirit of the existing international cooperation, it is ready to provide foreign partners with possibilities to carry out their research at Vernadsky station during the whole year or just in the summer season.
It would be of interest especially for non-Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, which do not have their own Antarctic stations, bases or field camps but are striving for conducting “substantial scientific research activity” in Antarctica (Par.2 Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty) that may be a prerequisite for the attainment of their Consultative status (point 218 of the ATCM XXXIX Final Report).
