IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism:
2018-19 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 
2019-20 Season
Information Paper Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO)
Introduction
IAATO is pleased to provide estimates of Antarctic tourism from IAATO Operators for the 2019-20 season and the statistical data compiled from Post Visit Reports for the 2018-19 season.
These figures are based on information provided to IAATO by its Operators as of 27 May, 2019. These numbers reflect only those travelling with IAATO Operator companies and do not include those individuals taking part in research projects that are being supported by IAATO Operators. 
The 2018-19 season (56,168 persons) was slightly higher (by 404 visitors) than the forecast in ATCM XLI IP71 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2017-18 and Preliminary Estimates for 2018-19 Season. Preliminary estimates for 2019-20 indicate that passenger numbers will rise to approximately 78,520 individuals.
1.0	Overview
This section focuses on the 2018-19 season. Additional information on this season and previous years, including activities and landing site use, will be posted on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under Guidelines and Resources, Tourism Statistics. Additionally, selected site-specific information is available in ATCM XLII IPxx Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2018-19 Season.
1.1	IAATO Member Activities
IAATO’s Membership continues to incorporate the majority of private-sector tour operators. All commercial SOLAS passenger ship operators that we are aware of conducting tourism activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area are currently members of IAATO. All IAATO Operators submit Environmental Impact Assessments or equivalent operational documents to their appropriate National Authority.

Final analysis of Post Visit Reports for the 2018-19 season indicates that there was a 9% increase in the overall tourism statistics from the 2017-18 season. Shipborne tourism remains dominant on the Peninsula and there were no IAATO Operator over-flights to the Antarctic continent. 

1.2   Scope of Commercial Tourist Activities for Seaborne Tourism 
Commercial tourism activities by IAATO Operators included the operation of small boats (Zodiac, Polar Cirkel Boat, RIB, Naiad, etc.), shore landings, and to a lesser extent, kayaking, mountain climbing, SCUBA diving, submersible diving, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding, skiing, snowboarding, camping (including short overnight stays), running events, helicopter operations, underwater ROVs and Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPASs).  These activities were undertaken in line with IAATO policies and guidelines. Most of these activities have taken place for well over the past decade with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the late 1960s. For more information on IAATO Operator activities see ATCM XLII IPxx A Catalog of IAATO Operator Activities.

1.4	Commercial Operated Activities Conducted from Expedition Vessels and Yachts
Detailed information of the activities conducted during the 2018-19 season are listed in Appendix 1, and anticipated activities for the 2019-20 season can be found in Appendix 2. All IAATO Operators activities are permitted or authorized through Environmental Impact Assessments, Advance Notifications and, where relevant, Waste Management Permits, submitted in advance of the season. All activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and nearly all activities have been conducted from expedition vessels and yachts for more than a decade. 
1.5	Commercial Deep Field Tourism 
Six IAATO Operators conducted deep field tourism activities during the 2018-19 season: 
    • Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) – (originally named Adventure Network International) one of the founding members of IAATO in 1991 – conducted activities for the 33rd consecutive season. 
    • The Antarctic Company (TAC) operated in Antarctica for the 14th consecutive season and 10th as an IAATO Operator. 
    • White Desert (WDL), which operated in Antarctica for the 13th consecutive season and 8th as an IAATO Operator. Early season flights and logistics for WDL are coordinated through TAC.
    • Arctic Trucks, which joined IAATO has operated in the Antarctic as a contractor since the 1990’s and as an Operator since the 2014-15 season.
    • ALE operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, and Ushuaia, Argentina; TAC and WDL operated out of Cape Town, South Africa. Arctic Trucks supported operations working from ALE and Novo camps.
    • Ice Trek Expeditions, a Provisional IAATO Operator, has been taking clients to Antarctica since 1999. Ice Trek’s flights and logistics are coordinated through TAC and ALE.
The six companies employed experienced guides; over 80% of which have worked previously in Antarctica. Staff and guides assist in the preparation of policies and guidelines; and ensure their implementation in the field.
1.5.1	Visitor & Staff Numbers
Details of the visitor numbers can be found in the appendices below. Deep field operators usually maintain a higher client to staff ratio than is typical for seaborne tourism– often in the region of 1 guide to every 3 clients. The exception is with solo expeditions, for example during South Pole Ski Expeditions, where the clients are supported remotely and closely through communication protocols, air drops and agreed search and rescue plans, etc. 
1.5.2	Aircraft Operations
ALE:
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, wastes, fuel, staff, guides and passengers between SCCI Punta Arenas, Chile, or SAWH Ushuaia, Argentina, and SCGC Runway 18M Union Glacier. 
    • Two ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and one ski-wheel configured Basler DC3-PT67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the season.
TAC: 
    • One Ilyushin IL-76 TD-90 was used to ferry general and hazardous cargo, wastes, fuel, staff, guides and passengers between Cape Town, South Africa and Novo Airbase.
    • One ski-equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and two Basler BT-67 aircraft were used for flights within Antarctica and to provide medical evacuation support throughout the season.
    • One Boeing 757-200 for flights between Cape Town and Novo Airbase. 
    • One Boeing 757-200CF Combi for flights between Cape Town and Novo Airbase.

White Desert:
    • One Gulf Stream G550 for flights between Cape Town and Wolf’s Fang
    • One Gulf Stream G650ER for flights between Cape Town and Wolf’s Fang
    • One Basler BT-67 and one DCH-6 Twin Otter aircraft used for flights within Antarctica
1.5.3 	Ground Transport
    • ALE operated a number of tractor traverses, primarily for more efficient transport of fuel and cargo, and to support scientific activities.
    • ALE, TAC, WDL and Arctic Trucks all used modified wheel and tracked vehicles 
1.5.4 Camps (Primary)
    • ALE Union Glacier Camp opened October 18, 2018 and closed January 31, 2019.
    • TAC Novo Camp opened October 25, 2018 and closed on February 14, 2019. 
    • WDL Wolf’s Fang Camp opened November 04, 2018 and closed on February 26, 2019.
    • WDL Whichaway Camp opened November 05, 2018 and closed on February 2, 2019.
1.5.5	Programs and Activities
Activities including the operation of standard programs, the organization and operation of private expeditions, and logistical support of other expeditions for the 2018-19 season, are outlined in the table below. Total numbers participating include clients from all four IAATO Deep Field Operators. Note that some clients participated in multiple programs.

2.0 Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2019-20 Season
Appendix 3 illustrates a breakout of tourism categories that are projected for the 2019-20 season.
For the 2019-20 season, those tourism categories where passengers land ashore – traditional small and medium-size expedition ships and yachts to both the Peninsula and the Ross Sea and carrying 500 or fewer passengers – are expected to reach approximately 59,000 passengers. This 33% increase is principally due to the anticipated launch of nine new ice-strengthened passenger vessels (Greg Mortimer, Hanseatic Inspiration, Hanseatic Nature, Hondius, Magellan Explorer, Roald Amundsen, Scenic Eclipse, Silver Whisperer and World Explorer) all of which will operate in the Peninsula area. The addition of these new vessels reflects an investment in new tonnage, predominantly by companies that have been operating in Antarctica for decades, following the finalisation of the IMO’s International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters. 
While discussions continue internally regarding managing for growth, ship-based tourism is expected to continue to include the operation of small auxiliary boats, shore landings, kayaking, mountain climbing, running events, SCUBA diving, snorkelling, swimming, skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, stand-up paddle boarding, camping (including short overnight stays), helicopter operations, use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPASs), underwater submersibles (HOV) and underwater remote operated vehicles (ROVs).
Cruise-only tourism, aboard 500-plus passenger vessels with no passengers landing ashore, is projected to increase to 18,420 passengers, an increase of 70%. This is primarily due to the return to Antarctic operations by Princess Cruise lines. 
Air to continent tourism, is conducted by six IAATO Operators providing deep field excursions and expeditions. Another IAATO Operator provides air access to the South Shetlands offering day-trips and overnights on King George Island.  The total projected numbers for air to continent and the South Shetland land-based activities is 733 visitors.
No over-flights by IAATO Operators are expected during the 2019-20 season.
IAATO Operators will continue to work together to coordinate activities in advance, so that operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that tourism activities are planned to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
3.0 Tourism Trends
A trends chart showing the change in IAATO Operator landed passengers, dating from the 1992-1993 season and including estimates for the 2019-20 season, can be found in Appendix 1 of this overview. 
4.0 Tourism Statistics
The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (http://www.iaato.org) and can be found as a link “Tourism Statistics” under the category of Guidelines and Resources: In order to better assist with delivering appropriate statistics for interested parties, those who wish to access the IAATO tourism statistics must now do so through a data access portal.
