The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators joins Fellowship Program

Information Paper submitted by IAATO 

Background
The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) have been working together to attract talented early-career researchers, scientists, engineers, environmental managers, and other professionals to strengthen international capacity and cooperation in fields such as climate, biodiversity, conservation, humanities and astrophysics research. One way of doing so is by providing support for early career professionals through an annual fellowship scheme. The fellowships provide funding to enable early-career persons to join a project team from another country, opening up new opportunities and often creating partnerships that last for many years and over many Antarctic field seasons. 
For 2019, these Antarctic organisations are joined by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) who will each support an additional Antarctic-related fellowship. The IAATO Fellowship will focus on adding to our understanding of human presence in the Antarctic.  
IAATO and COMNAP collaboration on inaugural IAATO Fellowship
For 2019 in an effort to streamline administration for IAATO as a new participant in the Fellowship scheme, COMNAP and IAATO will work together on the application process, the review of applications, the selection process and the administration of the inaugural fellowship. In the same manner that SCAR assisted COMNAP in the first years of the COMNAP Fellowship, COMNAP will assist IAATO to ensure support during the process of selecting an inaugural IAATO fellow. 
The IAATO Fellowship opportunity
IAATO works within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty System to help deliver its mission and vision for safe, environmentally responsible private-sector Antarctic travel. Education and outreach, in particular engaging as many people as possible in the value and importance of Antarctica, is an integral part of IAATO’s work. 
The IAATO fellowship hopes to foster further cooperation between private-sector travel and the international scientific community in the Antarctic. As such successful applicants must demonstrate that their proposed projects reflect the objectives of IAATO and add to the understanding of human presence in the Antarctic.
The candidate must be within the first five years after completion of their highest level of university award/certificate/degree obtained; or any person without a university qualification that is under the age of 40 years old on the day of the deadline for the application submission.

Applications are welcome from: 
    • A range of disciplines and fields, including but not limited to, those with backgrounds in Engineering, Environmental Management, Tourism-related, Data Management, Technology, Social Sciences, Humanities, Education, Communication and Outreach, Law, Operations and Logistics, Search and Rescue, Medical and Science.
    • Those wishing to work with members of the IAATO community, this may include in-kind support from an IAATO Operator such as an opportunity to work on an IAATO Operator vessel (subject to confirmation of availability on a case-by-case basis). 
    • Those who wish to visit/complete project work at a facility or higher learning institute in an Antarctic Treaty country that is different from applicant’s: (a) country of citizenship (which should be an Antarctic Treaty country), and (b) country of current residence.
