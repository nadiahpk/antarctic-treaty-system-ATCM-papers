30-yrs of exploration in Antarctica

Information Paper submitted by Italy 


Summary
The Italian Hydrographic Institute (IIM) collaborates with the Italian National Antarctic Program (PNRA) since 1986, although its polar experience in the Arctic environment started in the twenties. 
During more than 30 years of collaboration, well-trained specialized hydrographers operated under the umbrella of the Italian PNRA, providing their specific contribution not only for the seabed mapping but also in the context of oceanography, geophysics, topography and cartography. The Italian Hydrographic Institute provided a significant contribution to international cartographic portfolio for safety of navigation. Data integration between different type of surveys and sharing of capabilities at both national and international levels, represent the benefit that make IIM fitted with skills to be used in Polar Regions.

1. Introduction

The Italian National Antarctic Program (PNRA) started in 1985 with the aim of ensuring the participation of Italy to the Antarctic Treaty by developing scientific research in the Antarctic continent. PNRA is directed by the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) through three national bodies: the National Scientific Committee for Antarctica (CSNA) for long term objectives and strategies; the National Research Council (CNR) for the coordination of scientific research and the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) for the logistic implementation of the Antarctic expeditions. Italy built two stations, the first Mario Zucchelli Station (MZS) on the coast of the Ross Sea, the second Concordia Station - jointly with France – on the East Antarctic plateau.
The Italian Hydrographic Institute (IIM) is involved in exploration, survey and nautical cartographic activity. The hydrographic team works annually within PNRA and consists generally of two hydrographers, assisted by researchers and logistic personnel during surveys.

2. IIM role in the Italian National Antarctic Program 

Differently from how it can be easily thought, the involvement of IIM in PNRA did not start from sea activities but from ground activities, with the support provided in the construction of the Italian Scientific Station “Mario Zucchelli”. In the 80s, in fact, IIM geodetic team’s capability in the creation of reference networks, highly trained at sea, provided the decisive impetus to operate in a remote area for the construction of the base and therefore for the launch of the research program. Moreover, IIM personal attitude to follow procedures and standards represented an important point while exploring the area of operation.  
Still nowadays, IIM cooperates with the Italian Geodetic Observatory in Antarctica focused on the establishment and maintenance of the geodetic framework, in order to provide measurements and analysis for the characterization of neo-tectonic of a large area of Northern Victoria Land. The observatory is based on continuous GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) measurements, for the definition of a three-dimensional reference, and tide gauge measurements, for the creation of an absolute local and global elevation reference model.

One of the activities funded by PNRA since 1986 was the investigation, carried out off MZS,  aiming at populating the international portfolio through the creation of the Nautical Charts of the assigned area, the Western Ross Sea.  
Geographical limits of interest and Italian chart size for Antarctica, as shown in IHO publication S-59, are included in the Italian Hydrographic Institute Cartographic Plan for the Antarctica (see Table 1).

Specific surveys and chart production, focused on seabed mapping for safety of navigation, are also normally developed according to PNRA exigencies.

The history of the produced charts reflects the evolution of IIM involvement in the PNRA during the last three decades. In particular, IIM contribution in the field of PNRA can be divided in three main phases detailed as follows. 
In addition, IIM established a joint research project with the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics (OGS) in polar areas: Institutes normally share data and produce thematic maps over the areas of interest. 

1st phase (from 1986 to 1990): hydrographic data gathering under research activities; 

As the Italian PNRA did not own any vessel in the past, scientific activity was guaranteed using chartered vessels, fully equipped with crew, maintenance and instruments. In this respect, the first expedition to Terra Nova Bay was supported by the Norwegian vessel “Polar” and since then different vessels equipped to carry out the planned research projects were employed. As consequence, hydrographic activity could only be carried out through portable instruments (singlebeam) to be used on board the small survey boat named “Malippo”, conducted in the proximity of the “Terranova Base”. The survey activity was driven by scientific purpose more than cartographical needs. Furthermore, 1:50.000 and 1:100.000 surveys had the aim to provide cartographic support to those involved in research activities in the field of oceanography, geology and biology in the Terra Nova Bay area, never surveyed before. 
 
In addition, as anticipated, IIM distinguished itself for the creation of a geodetic network used both for the construction of “Terranova base” and scientific research. Oceanographic and geophysics surveys were also carried out in cooperation with the research institutes. 

2nd phase (from 1990 to 2005): hydrographic activity on board hydrographic equipped vessel, INT chart 9500 and 9004 production in the western Ross Sea 
From 1990, naval support was assured by use of the M/V Italica, which served PNRA from 1991. M/V Italica was equipped with a hull-mounted singlebeam. The availability of a vessel to be used for surveys represented the beginning of a new phase that allowed the production of the first two charts (scale 1:50.000 and 1:250.00). 
In particular, the first nautical chart (nr. 881 - INT9500), published in May 2000, was produced using the data acquired from 1986 to 1998 Campaign. This chart represents the first nautical product that integrates satellite data for the land part (SPOT XS), obtained from Telespazio in 1988 and elaborated by ENEA, and bathymetric data. 
In 2005, the hydrographic team completed the data acquisition for the production of the nautical chart nr. 884 – INT9004 that has been published in 2007 employing LANDSAT THEMATIC MAPPER satellite data (1990) for the land part. 

3rd phase (2006-2016): small scale chart production; 
The third phase is characterized by the production of the smallest scale nautical chart (nr. 885 - INT9000) that was published with the correspondent ENC in 2017, integrating 2006-2016 hydrographic surveys and data obtained from National Geospatial Agency (NGA). The Italica vessel served PNRA for more than twenty expeditions and was disarmed in 2017.

3. International Cooperation and IIM polar skills 

Under the activities of the Italian PNRA, IIM contributes to GEBCO International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) and Seabed 2030 project. 
IIM has a plurennial cooperation with the Argentinian, Chilean and Peruvian Navy. Argentina and Chile annually offer valuable training and practical experiences in Antarctica to IIM personnel. Since 2017, IIM increased its cooperation also with the Peruvian Navy: a joint research project will be carried out on the Orca Seamount (Bransfield Strait) thanks to the data acquired during the oceanographic survey campaign carried out with the vessel Carrasco Antarctic. This campaign has seen the participation of and Italian Navy hydrographer. 
PNRA benefited from IIM involvement at international level: the cooperation between nations, the knowledge sharing and common training execution in polar regions are fundamental to guarantee data exploitation and an effective seabed mapping in such a remote area as the Antarctica. 

During decades of activity on the field, IIM personnel developed unique capabilities to work in remote environments or exploratory contexts, where no specific supports are present. This characteristic of the hydrographers comes from the habit of using procedures and applying standards. The experience shows that procedures that are normally used during hydrographic survey activities are perfectly applicable to other contexts in remote areas. This approach is currently applied in the “High North” Artic programme. 
Moreover, data integration between different type of surveys and sharing of capabilities at both national and international levels, represent the added value that make IIM fitted with skills to be used in Polar regions. 
In these areas, IIM also make use of high technology and innovative solutions that are perfectly in tune with the exploratory spirit that drives the activities now as in the past. 
In 1996, the important discovery with the vessel M/V Italica of the “Italica Peak”, a volcanic peak with a topo at 5,7 m and a bottom at 300 m water depth, located about 3 nautical miles from Edmonson Point, Washington Cape. 

4. Final considerations

During the thirty-year collaboration with the Italian National Antarctic Program, IIM managed to contribute to the international portfolio of nautical charts for safety of navigation producing all the assigned INT charts. 
IIM, as part of the “PNRA System” collaborates, coordinates and cooperates with national and international bodies for data sharing in the marine domain. Thanks to this joint research approach, PNRA benefits from data and knowledge to be used in the fields of the scientific research, ocean mapping and safety of navigation. 
Recently the Italian National Institute of Oceanography and Geophysics (OGS) acquired from BAS a polar research vessel with a specific financing from the Italian ministry of research (MIUR). The N/R Laura Bassi, among other tasks, will serve the PNRA for its future necessities starting from the next Antarctic season and will give strength to joint research activity projects. IIM is working to support this project with instruments and capabilities, also facing new research and technological challenges dipped in an international scenario.
