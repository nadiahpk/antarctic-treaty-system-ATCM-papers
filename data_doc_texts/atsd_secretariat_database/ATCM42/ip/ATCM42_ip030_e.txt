Report by the CEP Observer 
to the XXXV SCAR Delegates’ Meeting

Summary
The XXXV Meeting of Delegates’ of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) was held 25-26 June 2018, in Davos, Switzerland. This paper presents some aspects of the meeting that may be of particular relevance to the work of the CEP.
Introduction
At CEP XXI, the Committee nominated the CEP Representative from Norway to act as the CEP Observer at the XXXV SCAR Delegates Meeting in Davos, Switzerland (25-26 June, 2018). The SCAR Delegates Meeting was attended by Delegates from 28 countries, Associate Members from 11 countries, 6 Union Members, and representatives of the SCAR Subsidiary Groups.  The documents presented and discussed during the meeting and the final meeting report are available from the SCAR website (see: https://www.scar.org/excom-meetings/xxxv-scar-delegates-2018-davos-switzerland/)
The SCAR Delegates Meeting was chaired by its President, Steven Chown, and took place in conjunction with the SCAR & IASC Open Science Conference “Polar 2018”.
During this meeting, two new countries (Portugal and Ukraine) joined SCAR as Full Members and one new country as Associate Members (Belarus) and confirmed their commitment to the development of Antarctic research. 
Gary Wilson (New Zealand) and M Ravichandran (India) were elected new vice-chairs for 4 years. Catherine Ritz (France) was elected vice-chair for 2 years.
Aspects of the meeting of particular relevance to the CEP

New Scientific Research Programmes
SCAR has initiated the process of developing new Scientific Research Programmes (SRPs) to replace the current 6 programmes1. New programmes will be considered at the next Delegates meeting. The meeting discussed potential programmes which will work to develop full proposals to the 2020 Delegates meeting. The potential programmes are all directed towards overarching issues and areas of concern for policy and management, and the needs of the CEP and the Antarctic Treaty system in general has been highlighted as a rational for these programmes:
    • Integrated Conservation Planning for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (Ant-ICON) which will aim to answer fundamental science questions (as identified by the SCAR Horizon Scan), relating to the conservation and management of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and focus on research to drive and inform international decision-making and policy change. The SRP will focus on four research themes, broadly covering: i) integrated forecasting of future change to support conservation planning; ii) environmental sustainability of human activities in Antarctica; iii) Antarctic conservation in a global context; and iv) socio-ecological approaches to conservation planning. For the Planning Group, the initial Chief Officer is Aleks Terauds (Australia). 
    • Near-term Variability and Prediction of the Antarctic Climate System (AntClimnow) which will aim to investigate prediction of near-term conditions in the Antarctic climate system on timescales of years to multiple decades. These time scales are highly relevant across multiple disciplines and to a range of key stakeholders whilst aligning strongly with scientific priorities identified as part of the SCAR Horizon Scan. Initial Chief Officers are Tom Bracegirdle (UK) and David Bromwich (USA). 
    • Antarctic Ice Sheet Dynamics and Global Sea Level (AISSL) which will aim to quantify the Antarctic ice sheet contribution to past and future global sea-level change, from improved understanding of climate, ocean and solid Earth interactions and feedbacks with the ice, so that decision-makers can better anticipate and assess the risk in order to manage and adapt to sea-level rise and evaluate mitigation pathways. The Initial Chief Officer is Tim Naish (New Zealand),

Scientific Groups
The current scientific groups reported progress to the meeting and highlighted coming efforts Worth noting the establishment of several new Action and Expert groups:.
    • Geosciences Group (GSG: https://www.scar.org/science/gsg/home/): 
        ◦ AntArchitecture was agreed as a new action group - shared with PSG. The goal of AntArchitecture is to develop a continent‐wide age-depth model of Antarctica’s ice using the internal layers and surfaces imaged by radarsounding. The product underpins a wider goal to determine the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheets over past glacial cycles.
    • Life Sciences Group (LSG: https://www.scar.org/science/lsg/home/): 
        ◦ Input Pathways of persistent organic pollutants to AntarCTica (ImPACT) (shared with PSG). ImPACT is a policy-impact driven Action Group which will facilitate coordinated investigation of chemical input to the Antarctic region, aiming to serve both the Global Monitoring Plan of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), as well as the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
        ◦ Plastics in Polar Environments (PLASTIC-AG) (shared with  PSG) will examine the presence, origin and biological effects of macro-, micro- and nanoplastics, quantify the scale of the problem and propose solutions for minimising the environmental risk and impacts on Polar ecosystems.
        ◦ SCAR Krill Action Group (SKAG) aims to become the prime conduit between CCAMLR and the wider krill science community to provide a forum to set research directions and promote collaboration to improve understanding of krill biology and ecology, and to assist in providing critical scientific information that matters the krill fishery management. 
    • Physical Sciences Group (PSG: (https://www.scar.org/science/psg/home/): 
        ◦ AntArchitecture jointly with GSG and ImPACT jointly with LSG (see above)
        ◦ ANtarctic Gravity Wave Instrument Network (ANGWIN) aims to develop a network of Antarctic gravity wave observatories, operated by different nations working together to address scientific processes on a polar scale.
        ◦ Earth Observation Action Group (EOAG) which advocates for acquiring satellite data over the Antarctic and Southern Ocean region from multiple space agencies, to recommend the type observations needed to measure climate variables and to recommend how best to preserve earth observation data long term. 

SCAR is furthermore undertaking a review of the current structure of SCAR and its subsidiary bodies, led initially by the Vice-President for Administration, Gary Wilson. The development of new SCAR groups and activities will be subject to the outcome of this review, which may alter aspects of SCAR’s rules for subsidiary bodies.

SCAR Standing Committee on the Antarctic Treaty System (SCATS)
Dr. Aleks Terauds reported on the progress and plans of the SCAR Standing Committee on the Antarctic Treaty System (SCATS), including interactions with the Treaty and the CEP. 

SC-ATS continues to energetically pursue the development of new policy-relevant advice through active engagement with international scientists and policy makers. In this context relevant to note the following achievements and plans:

    • taking on a leading role in the SCAR/CEP initiative to facilitate the further development of an Antarctic protected area system.
    • improving its engagement with the Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
    • Completion of Stage 1 and 2 of SCAR Review of Anthropogenic Noise in the Southern Ocean
    • Publication of results from the First Monaco Assessment – Antarctica and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity


Planned deliveries and commitments relevant to the CEP

2019
    • Review of Anthropogenic Underwater Noise in the Southern Ocean (carried over from 2018)
    • Code of Conduct for Use of Animals in Scientific Research (carried over from 2018)
    • Results of the international workshops held in 2017 
    • Release of the revised SCAR Antarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity Database (in conjunction with SC-ADM ) 
    • A snapshot of Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity protection

Forthcoming
    • SCAR Code of Conduct on Geological Field Research in Antarctica 

SCAR Delegates approved the further development of the Antarctic Environments Portal and agreed that the SCAR Secretariat continue to work with New Zealand colleagues on the transfer of the operation of the Portal to SCAR over the next two years

Next meeting
The next SCAR Delegates’ Meeting will be held in Hobart, Australia, in July/August 2020.
