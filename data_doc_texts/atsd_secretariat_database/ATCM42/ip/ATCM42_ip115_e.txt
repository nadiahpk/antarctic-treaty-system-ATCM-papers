Celebration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Strait of Magellan and the 200 years of Antarctic exploration
Information paper presented by Chile
Summary
Chile reports on the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Strait of Magellan in 2020 and the activities celebrating the 200 years of sighting and landing in the Antarctic.
500 years of the Strait of Magellan
In October 2020, 500 years will be commemorated since Hernando de Magallanes crossed the narrow austral strait that bears his name, uniting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This milestone, which is part of the Fifth Centennial of the First Travel Around the World, brings Chile together to the commemorations that Spain and Portugal, mainly, are developing.
In this context, Chile wanted to highlight this date with the creation of a high-level Presidential Advisory Council to lead the national celebrations of the V Centenary of the Circumnavigation of Hernando de Magallanes, which opened a door to cultural and commercial exchange in the world, recognizing, in addition, that the discovery of the Strait was key in the opening of the maritime routes to the greater transit of ships. In this context, the government of Chile and the Municipality of Punta Arenas are preparing a program of activities that should begin to be implemented this year (2019) and extend beyond October of 2020. The project to upgrade the Punta Arenas waterfront includes a site museum with full-scale replicas of emblematic ships of the world exploration: "Nao Victoria" (Hernando de Magallanes), "HMS Beagle" (Robert FitzRoy-Charles Darwin), "Ancud" (John Williams), "James Caird" (Ernest Shackleton) and "Yelcho" (Luis Pardo).
With this, Chile hopes to enhance October 21 of 2020, date on which the five hundred years of the discovery of the Strait of Magellan will be celebrated, in a framework of cooperation, to promote the development of the southern territory, through the facilitation of trade, the development of infrastructure, interconnectivity, promoting tourism and investment, as well as scientific cooperation and protection of the environment.
200 years of Antarctic exploration
In 2020, the 200th anniversary of three decisive milestones of the Antarctic exploration is also fulfilled: the first sightings of the continent and of the first landing registered in its coasts.
In the summer of 1820 the expeditions of Bellingshausen (aboard the "Vostok", January 27) and Smith (aboard the "Williams", January 30) made the first sightings of northern regions of the Antarctic Peninsula, and Andrew Macfarlane (on board the "Dragon") lands on December 16 on the continent, in a sector of the peninsula located south of Deception Island. Both the "Dragon" and the "Williams" had sailed from the port of Valparaiso, Chile, reminding the importance of this country as a bridge to Antarctica, and of Punta Arenas as a gateway to the white continent in that period and, above all, in the so-called "heroic era" of Antarctic exploration, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
In this context, Chile, through its Antarctic Institute, will reissue, updated, the book Traces of Antarctica around Punta Arenas and the Strait of Magellan, which gathers information from around fifty places related to Antarctic history.
