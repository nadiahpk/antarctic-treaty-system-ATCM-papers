Report on the tasks completed by the Naval Hydrographic Service in Antarctica 2018/19
Document Presented by Argentina



Summary

The present document describes the activities carried out by the Argentine Republic, through its Naval Hydrographic Service, to improve navigational safety and the protection of the maritime and Antarctic coastal environments. The latest news about beaconing and particularly aids to navigation (AIS AtoN) are also introduced here. Finally, updates related to argentine nautical charts and domestic news regarding topography are also presented in this document. 


Introduction

The Automatic Identification System (AIS) facilitates the automatic identification and tracking of vessels from other ships, aircraft and coastal stations. Although its primary objective was to contribute to avoid collisions at sea, its applications have exceeded the initial expectations, transforming AIS into a multifaceted aid to navigation. 

The Argentine Republic, in response to increase of navigation in Antarctica continues its work, through joint efforts between the Argentine Navy, the Naval Hydrographic Service, Hidrovía S.A. (company responsible for providing dredging and beaconing services) and the Joint Antarctic Command, to renew and increase the installation of AIS AtoN in Antarctica, with the objective of complementing the beaconing process. 

As part of the national efforts within the scope of the Antarctic Summer Campaign 2018/2019, 11 beacons were given maintenance and repairs, and one AIS AtoN device was renewed, increasing the total number of signals emitted by this AtoN.

Regarding nautical cartography, during 2018 two new international nautical charts were presented and a new edition of the national chart was produced. Likewise, new toponyms have been assigned and a major process of digitalization has been conducted on the national toponym database, implying a very important contribution to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).



Development

    1. AIS AtoN

During the Antarctic Summer Campaign 2018/2019, aware of the need to increment aids to navigation and, after eight years of successful service, the Argentine Republic has renewed an AIS AtoN device at ORCADAS Station (LAT. 60º 44’S, LON 044º 44’ W), called ORCADAS 2, to replace the previous ones (ORCADAS 1 Y ORCADAS 2). This new equipment allows the generation of 10 signals instead of the previous 4 (eight in total) of the former devices.

Likewise, it was decided the installation of a new AIS AtoN during the Antarctic Summer Campaign 2019/2020, at PRIMAVERA base (LAT.64º09’ S, LON 060º 58’ W), that will generate 10 new signals. 


    2. Beaconing
During the Antarctic Summer Campaign 2018/2019, preventive and corrective maintenance duties on the beacons were conducted, as follows:

    3. Nautical cartography:

During 2018, the following nautical charts were edited:

INT 9153 / H-734 Punta Iglesia / Church Point to Cabo Deseo / Cape Longing (Edited by Argentina in 2018).
INT 9154 / H-733 Isla Joinville / Joinville Island to Cabo Ducorps / Cape Ducorps (Edited by Argentina in 2018).
Chart H-7 “Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur” Province and Antarctic Peninsula. (3rd Edition).

During this year, the following charts will be edited:

INT 9101 / H-757 / ENC AR507570 Peninsula Trinidad – Base Esperanza / Trinity Peninsula - Esperanza Station – Caleta Choza / Hut Cove: Expected for the month of july.
INT 9140 / H-611 / ENC AR306110 Islas Orcadas del Sur / South Orkney Islands: During the second semester.

Pending charts:
	
INT 9100 Isla Marambio – Base Marambio / Seymour Island – Marambio Station: This chart, due to corresponding to glaciological complex area, could not be surveyed for the moment. 
INT 9115 Isla Dundee / Dundee Island: This chart was surveyed to a 30%, and its completion is among the SHN’s priorities. 
INT 9170 / H-700 Islas Shetland del Sur / South Shetland Islands and Mar de la Flota / Bransfield Strait (Edited in 1997). Its corresponding ENC is currently in works.  

Summarizing, of the 11 INT charts in charge of the Argentine Republic, 7 are already available for navigators, and 2 are expected to be released this year.


    4. Toponymy:

4 new toponyms (Bernasconi Cove, Caría Point, Fontes Cove and Pujals Cove) have been added. The first three located on “1° de Mayo” Island (Melchior Archipelago), and the last one located in Jason Peninsula. The names were selected as a tribute to the first female argentine scientific researchers that worked in Antarctica during the ‘60s. Likewise, toponymy archives were digitalized, generating an own data base for its administration. 
Finally, as a contribution to the toponymy database of the SCAR, up to now, 2500 Antarctic place names were included and completed. 



Conclusion

Through a permanent effort, materialized in the cartographic production and the maintenance and increase of beaconing and AtoN, including modernization through new technologies, the Argentine Republic seeks to improve the safety of human life at sea and to prevent marine pollution in Antarctica.
