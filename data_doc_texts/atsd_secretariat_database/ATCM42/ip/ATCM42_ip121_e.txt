Artigas Scientific Antarctic Station renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste management plan
Introduction
This papers aims to inform the XLII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting participants and global stakeholders about the renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste management plan the Government of Uruguay is developing for the Artigas Scientific Antarctic Station (BCAA, due to its name in Spanish) and the progress made up to now.  
Background
The BCAA is located at King George Island on the South Shetland Islands, coordinates: 62°11′04″S 58°54′14″W. It was founded by the Uruguayan National Government on December 22nd 1984. 
The station operates continually throughout the year providing the necessary logistic support for carrying out the scientific activities of the National Antarctic Program (NAP) and other Antarctic operators. It comprises a total area of 24,000 m2 and its infrastructure consists of 13 buildings. It receives about 60 visitors in the summer. Meanwhile, during winter (May - November) the permanent staff is reduced to 9 people.
Antarctic operational and logistical activities are performed by the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute (IAU), dependent on the Ministry of National Defence, which supports and coordinates the scientific research and technological development operations established by the NAP in accordance with the provisions of the Antarctic National Policy and within the guidelines of the Antarctic Treaty System.
In 2018 the Uruguayan National Government approved by Decree N°60/018 the organizational and operational procedure of the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute. It establishes that the strategic direction of the NAP will be conducted by the Inter-ministerial Cabinet of Antarctic Matters, which consists of the heads of the Ministries that integrate the IAU’ Boards of Directors: the Ministry of International Affairs (MRREE); the Ministry of Housing, Land Use Planning and Environment (MVOTMA); the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (MIEM); and the Ministry of National Defence (MDN).  Additionally, the procedure establishes that the Counsellor representing the MIEM will assume the Head of the Technology and Infrastructure Directorate and the tasks established in the Operating Manual. 
Within this framework, the MIEM is coordinating an inter-institutional working group – consisting of representatives from the state owned utility (UTE); the national oil company (ANCAP) and the MIEM -to design and implement a renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste management plan with the aims of reducing the station dependence on oil and reducing the CO2 emissions. 
The plan
The station has been historically reliant on Antarctic diesel for electricity generation, transport and treatment of solid waste and wastewater, consuming 200 m3/year in average, of which 87% is utilized to generate 600 MWh/year.

To reverse this situation and reduce the environmental impact of the BCAA, the plan aims to incorporate renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and an adequate and environmentally friendly wastes management. 

The plan is based on the below antecedents and achievements of the country and the BCAA as well as projects in progress:
    • Uruguay has an internationally recognized energy performance with 98% of its electricity generation from renewable energy sources (wind, biomass, hydro and solar), a National Energy Efficiency Plan, among others strengths,
    • The country is nowadays strongly committed to the sustainable mobility, particularly through the introduction of electric vehicles, in order to decarbonize the transport sector,
    • The BCAA has an excellent communication infrastructure, and 
    • The BCAA is considered a national pilot for the development and implementation of a circular economy model. 

The plan goals are:
    • To promote the implementation of renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal and wind with the minimum environmental impact and at the lowest feasible cost. 
    • To promote and implement energy efficiency technologies and best practices of responsible and efficient use of energy. 
    • To implement the best technically and economically viable practices for the management of solid waste and wastewater, focussing on waste-to-energy technologies.
    • To analyse and test blends of biodiesel mixed with Antarctic diesel.
The ambitious preliminary goals of the plan in the short, medium and long term are:
    • By 2020: 5-10% of electricity demand supplied by wind and solar PV generation; 25% energy savings (compared to the base period 2016-2017) and 20% reduction of the station carbon footprint (compared to the base period 2016-2017).
    • By 2035: 70% of electricity demand supplied by wind and solar PV generation; 50% energy savings (compared to the base period 2016-2017) and 50% reduction of the station carbon footprint (compared to the base period 2016-2017).
    • By 2045: 100% of electricity demand supplied by wind and solar PV generation; 60% energy savings (compared to the base period 2016-2017) and 90% reduction of the station carbon footprint (compared to the base period 2016-2017). 
The targets will be reviewed and adjusted based on more information available and the progress made by ongoing and future studies. 
Projects implemented up to now and next steps
In the summer campaigns of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 the following renewable energy and energy efficiency pilot projects were implemented in the station: 
    • Pilot 1.2 kWp vertical photovoltaic panels
It is installed in the north wall of the storage building. The aluminium structure can resist winds up to 190 km/h.
According to the first year operation evaluation the project generated 634 kWh with an average load factor of 6.03%.
    • Pilot 6 kWp of photovoltaic panels
It consists in a floor installation with metal supports. The angle of elevation and the orientation of the panels were optimized to maximize the electricity generation. One of the main challenges encountered in the design was the need to withstand winds of up to 200km/h.
    • Heat pump in the kitchen and dinning room building  
    • 100% LED interior lightening
For the 2019-2020 campaign, the planned projects are:
    • 6 kW wind turbine
    • Heat pump in the “AINA” bedrooms building
    • Biodigester of 1.2 m3 to treat the organic solid waste and capture the biogas to produce thermal energy to maintain the biodigester temperature.
    • Pilot solar thermal panel in the kitchen and dining room building 
    • The system will consist in an indirect, pressurized, split system, without auxiliary system, consisting in a vacuum tubes collector and an accumulation tank authorized by the national government regulatory unit for energy and water services (URSEA) within the framework of the National Solar Plan or the Solar Law. Pilot of batteries to be able to operate isolated with a high share of renewable energies.
    • Analysis of alternatives to treat the sewage in situ to avoid its transportation to the continent as it is nowadays
    • Greenhouse installation (heated by the waste heat from the generators nowadays dissipated to the ambient and the inert digestate obtained from the biodigester) to cultivate and supply fresh vegetables to the personnel during winter as a specific application of circular economy.

These projects are the first steps of the plan that laid the basis to study the performance of the above technologies in the Antarctica to move forward with the plan implementation to achieve the ambitious goals.
