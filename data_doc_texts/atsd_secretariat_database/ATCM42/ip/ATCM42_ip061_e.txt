Turkish Antarctic Expedition (TAE - III) 2018 - 2019
Summary
This paper gives a brief report on Turkey’s third expedition conducted under the National Polar Science Program during the 2018-19 season.
Introduction
Turkish Antarctic Expedition - III (TAE-III) was supported by the “Presidency of the Republic of Turkey”, sponsored by the “Ministry of Industry and Technology” and coordinated by the Istanbul Technical University Polar Research Center (ITU PolReC). TAE-III with 24 scientists and 13 projects on board the vessel sailed along the Western Antarctic Peninsula during February 2019. 24 scientists consisted of 18 national and 6 international scientists (Barbora Chattova / Masayk University, Stefan Penkov Velev / Bulgarian Antarctic Institute, Shelley Anne MacDonell / INACH, Francisco Fernandoy / INACH, Arno Christian Hammann / INACH, Lissette Tamara Muñoz / INACH).  The operations included the setup of Turkish Temporary Camp on Horseshoe Island made up of 3 container sized modules. Betanzos sailed South along the Peninsula and sailed back to King George Island. Along the route, 13 projects were conducted on board the vessel. Additionally, fully operational Automatic Weather Station (AWS) for measuring basic meteorological parameters was established with solar panels and batteries that could support the system up to four months in case of full darkness without sunshine. The station is also equipped with a satellite modem and antenna for data transmission. 

The titles of the 13 scientific projects are listed below:
- Terrestrial ecosystems on the margin of maritime Antarctic: interactions between components,
- Geological investigations on Horseshoe Island, Antarctica,
- Ecology, diversity, taxonomy and biogeography of diatoms (Bacillariophyta) of Horseshoe Island,
- Psychrophil and Psychrotolerant microorganism studies which can breakdown with Genomic analysis of herbicides (Dalapon and Bromoxynil),
- Investigation of Genomic Variety Variation in Vascular Plants Specimens from Antarctica,
- Investigation of marine invertebrate diversity in the Antarctic Peninsula Region by using environmental DNA (eDNA) method, 
- Determination of Levels of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Antarctic Ecosystem; Passive Sampling Techniques,
- The analysis of the reactions of antarctica food webs to environmental changes with stable isotope, eDNA and palaeoecological methods,
- Detection and Determination of Heavy Metal Pollution in Sediment and Nacella Concinna in the vicinity of Antarctica,
- Investigation of Amphipod Krustase Fauna in the Shallow Water Tidal Zone Habitats of Antarctica Peninsula Region by DNA Barcoding Method,
- Plankton in Antarctic Pelagic Ecosystem: Pigment Composition, Community Structure, Prokaryotic Metagenics,
- Monitoring of Antarctic Region with AWS and GNSS Stations,

In addition, outreach and education activities were performed. Within the scope of outreach and education part of the expedition, drawings of elementary and middle school students about Antarctica by their own perspective were exhibited by scientists.
