Summary

Antarctica is a difficult place to conduct scientific research and this fact is especially true for first-time, new investigators starting their careers. To address this issue the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated in 1994 a series of International Advanced Training Programs in Antarctic Biology for early career scientists. There have been eleven sessions of this training program with the last one in January 2018 at McMurdo Station. Applications are accepted from any country and 42% of over 260 participants have been from institutions outside of the United States. These “Antarctic biology courses” have a proven record of introducing participants to key questions in Antarctic science and policy, providing hands on experience in Antarctic fieldwork, and affording the opportunity to understand and appreciate the complexities and logistical challenges of undertaking science in Antarctica. Course alumni have leveraged their Antarctic experience to develop new research directions and to establish research programs in a number of national Antarctic programs, initiate new collaborations, incorporate polar science into curricula at their home institutions, and enhance public outreach activities about Antarctica.

Description of Program

Biological impacts of climate change (e.g., responses to warming temperatures, ozone depletion, ocean acidification) and the evolution of biological diversity in the cold biosphere are central themes in the study of Antarctic organisms and ecosystems. Yet few students and early-career scientists have the opportunity to conduct field work in Antarctica, unless they are directly associated with a senior scientist who has a funded Antarctic project. As a result, it is quite challenging for most early career scientists to be successful in procuring funding and establishing Antarctic research projects. In response to this issue, in 1994 the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) supported the first in a series of international, advanced-level training courses for graduate students and post-doctoral scholars to study the biology of Antarctic marine organisms on site in Antarctica. Eleven of these month-long courses have been organized since then (ten at McMurdo Station, McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea and one at Palmer Station, Antarctic Peninsula) with the most recent at McMurdo Station in January 2018. Programs were held in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2016 and 2018. These training programs have focused on promoting integrative approaches to investigate the biology and adaptation of Antarctic marine organisms in the context of environmental change.

The NSF Biology courses are open to PhD students and post-doctoral scholars from a range of disciplines who have interests in the study of Antarctic marine organisms from the molecular to ecosystem levels of analyses. Number of participants (students and instructors) have ranged from 18 to 39 each season. NSF provides support for travel, meals, lodging, science support and field logistics. Over the previous eleven sessions, these courses have included over 260 participants from 142 institutions in 24 countries and representing 33 nationalities. 58% of participants have been from U.S. institutions and 42% from institutions in non-U.S. countries. Participants were enrolled in institutions located in following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, China, Russian Federation, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.

The major expectations of these training courses in Antarctica are to:

    1. introduce new researchers to the unique features of biological processes in an extreme cold environment,
    2. place that understanding of Antarctic biology in the context of environmental change in polar regions,
    3. train course participants in modern field and research methods used to study the mechanisms that are unique to biology in Antarctica,
    4. foster an appreciation for the importance of the physical and biological components of the Antarctic ecosystem on global processes, and
    5. prepare early career scientists for success in developing their own independent research programs in polar regions to promote and establish the next generation of polar scientists.

These training programs have included early-career scientists from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds: molecular biology, ecology, physiology, climate modelling, protein chemistry, etc. Participants learn about long-standing and recent questions and key issues in polar science while gaining hands-on experience in Antarctic field activities. The course format includes 1) field safety training required by the U.S. Antarctic Program (e.g., survival in an extreme cold environment, traveling on sea ice by foot or ground vehicle, flying in helicopters for transport to field sites); 2) lectures covering the physical aspects of the Antarctic environment; the unique biology, ecology and evolution of Antarctic organisms; the physiological, biochemical and molecular biological approaches used to understand biological adaptations of Antarctic organisms; 3) discussions of Antarctic policy (e.g., Antarctic Treaty) and the role of international organizations (e.g., Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs) in fostering international science coordination and cooperation; 4) field sampling of biota living in ice, water, soils and snow; and 5) laboratory experiments and analyses of field samples. Student activities and class projects follow the interwoven themes of Antarctic ecology and evolution. While some of the science exercises are pre-planned by course faculty, participants also have the opportunity to develop and carry out ideas for group projects during the month-long program. Below are titles of some of student projects from the 2016 (Antarctic Peninsula) and 2018 (McMurdo Sound) courses:

    • Integrating biomechanics and the microbiome
    • Resilience of marine microbiota from McMurdo Sound to abiotic stresses
    • Understanding the drivers of Phaeocystis antarctica and bacterial success in Antarctic waters
    • Comparative physiology of Antarctic taxa
    • Benthic biodiversity of Western Antarctic Peninsula
    • Selective feeding in Antarctic amphipods
    • Thermal sensitivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) performance: from molecules to grazing
    • On the regenerative capacity of some Antarctic sponges
    • Physical factors driving community diversity, abundance and gene regulation in winter sea ice - Flanders Bay, Antarctica
    • Fluctuations in bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton abundance in Arthur Harbor, Antarctic Peninsula over one month in winter
    • Diel patterning over two days in plankton communities at Palmer Station, Antarctica during winter 2016
    • Bacterial growth and activity in the extreme marine Antarctic environment
    • Fluid flows generated by krill (Euphausia superba)
    • A dynamic microbiome in Southern Ocean krill (Euphausia superba)

The NSF International Advanced Training Program in Antarctic Biology for Early Career Scientists has been very successful in enhancing the careers of participants and contributing to the development of the next generation of polar researchers. Those involved in the program have gained a rigorous understanding of not only the power, but also the limitations, of physiological, biochemical and molecular biological methods that are currently used to address research questions in polar environmental science and biological adaptation; as well as acquiring a practical understanding of what can and cannot be accomplished working in the field in the extreme environment of Antarctica. Course participants are introduced to the international aspects of conservation, environmental management and governance in Antarctica, as well as coordination of multinational and interdisciplinary science activities. All of these insights provide a strong basis for submitting successful proposals to national Antarctic programs. Course alumni have used their training experience to expand career paths by developing new research directions, initiating domestic and international collaborations, establishing their own research programs in Antarctica, taking leadership roles in national Antarctic programs, incorporating polar science into curricula at their home institutions, and promoting public outreach activities about Antarctica.
