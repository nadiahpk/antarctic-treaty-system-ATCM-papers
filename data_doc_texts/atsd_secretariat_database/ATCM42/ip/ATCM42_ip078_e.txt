A review of tourist activities authorized by France in the Antarctic Treaty area during the 2017–18 season







A review of tourist activities authorized by France in the Antarctic Treaty area during the 2017–18 season
Context
This Information Paper (IP) reviews the Antarctic tourist activities authorized by the Prefect, chief administrator of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories (TAAF) and French National Competent Authority (NCA), as well as their inter-annual trend. The French regulation implementing the Madrid Protocol requires authorizations for tourist activities in the Antarctic Treaty area, which may be issued on the basis of an Initial Environmental Evaluation. The data taken into account are those from post-visit reports transmitted by operators. 

Note: This IP covers the 2017-18 season, as not all PVRs for the 2018-19 season have yet been transmitted.
Inter-annual trend of the number of visitors and trips
All the activities were ship based. Cruises were carried out from 16 ships, owned by 14 operators. This represents 13 sailboats and 3 cruise ships.

The number of visitors and trips increased during the 2017-18 season. Forty-six trips, involving a total of 5,133 passengers, were carried out. This represents a 12.7% increase in the number of visitors and 31.4% in the number of trips compared to the 2016-17 season. The 2017-18 season has recorded the highest number of visitors ever (Figure 1).

Temporal distribution of tourist visits
The first ship entered the Antarctic Treaty area on November 15, 2017. The last one left on March 16, 2018. January and February are the busiest months, when most operators are present at the same time (Table 1).

Geographical distribution of tourist visits
The ports of departure were Ushuaia (Argentina) and Puerto Williams (Chile).

All tourist activities authorized by the French NCA for the 2017-18 season took place in the Antarctic Peninsula. Ninety-nine sites were visited, mainly in the northern part of the peninsula (King George Islands, Deception Island), and along the western coast of Graham's Land (Figure 2). From North to South, visits ranged from Turret Point, King George Islands (62.08°) to Red Rock Ridge (68.28°).

The Palmer Islands region is the most visited region in terms of vessels (Figure 3, right). The sites with the highest number of passenger landings are also the Palmer Islands, as well as the archipelagoes and islands at the North of the peninsula, including King George Islands, Deception Island and Brown Bluff Island (Figure 3, left).

Eleven sites hosted more than 1,000 landings. Six of these are located around Palmer Archipelago (Figure 4). Port Lockroy, on Goudier Island, received 5,009 passengers, making it the most visited site this season. Neko Harbour (3,795 landings), Half Moon Island (King George Islands, far North of the peninsula, 2,911 landings) and Port Charcot (2,727 landings) received more than 2,000 visits. All these sites are covered by visitor site guidelines.

Types of activities carried out
The following activities were implemented as part of the cruises:
    • Landing: 233 occurrences
    • Extended walk: 56 occurrences
    • Station visit: 30 occurrences
    • Skiing: 12 occurrences
    • Ice landing: 7 occurrences
    • Anchoring: 92 occurrences
    • Small boat cruising: 74 occurrences
    • Kayak: 7 occurrences
    • Snorkeling: 4 occurrences
All terrestrial activities involve landing. However, this activity is considered independently when its single purpose is to visit the surroundings, without any other activity being carried out. 
Of the 99 visited sites, 33 were used for anchoring or marine activities without landing (kayaking, small boat cruising, etc.), and 66 were visited ashore. 
Landing was the most common activity, with 233 occurrences (Figure 5, top). It is the most important activity when it comes to the number of days per person1 (Figure 5, bottom). Extended walk comes next, fifty hikes were undertaken, amounting to 1,538 days/person.

Summary
The 2017-18 season experienced the most important tourist frequentation ever recorded until then by the French ANC, representing about 10% of the total number of visitors to the Treaty area. Activities were concentrated over time, mainly in January and February, and in space, in the northern part of the Peninsula and in the Palmer Archipelago region. Two thirds of the implemented activities involved landing.
