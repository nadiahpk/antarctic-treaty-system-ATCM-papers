Open Call to "Media coverage of the LV Antarctic Scientific Expedition (ECA 55)"
Information paper presented by Chile
Summary
Information is presented on the open call to the media to increase the coverage of the scientific activities of the National Program of Antarctic Science.
Antarctic Media application 
In 2018, for the first time, Chile, through the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), held an open application to choose the media that would cover the LV Antarctic Scientific Expedition (ECA 55) and disseminate the information of the Chilean Program of Antarctic Science. The aim was to promote the knowledge of Antarctic matters to the community, through the presence in the media with high quality journalism and wide scope, to stimulate the formation of a national community that understands the importance of knowledge and protection of the white continent.
Media professionals (newspapers, radio, television, and electronic media) or audio-visual producers were invited to apply and integrate the Antarctic Scientific Expedition and travelling to the Antarctic Peninsula region for on-site reporting of Chilean scientific and logistic activities during the Antarctic season 2018-2019. The open call is a way to obtain major transparency in the coverage of the Chilean scientific activity, as well as quality, in addition to generating new communication alliances.
In this first version, 32 applications were received from both national and foreign media; the proposals were evaluated by a committee made up of professionals from INACH and its Civil Society Council. According to the rules of the open call, nine communication professionals from different media or production companies were selected to carry out their activities in any of the platforms in which scientific activities would be carried out:
“Professor Julio Escudero” Station (INACH)
    • Rosario Jiménez-Gili and Eva Vera Cuadra (CNN, BiobioTV, CuriosityStream)
    • María Skinner Huerta (Heureka, National Maritime Museum, Blog NGO Plastic Ocean)
AP-41 “Aquiles”, Chilean Navy
    • Claudia Aranda Arellano (Pressenza)
    • Fernando Caro Carrasco (El Mostrador)
    • Cristian Fuentes Valencia (University of Chile)
    • Paula López Wood (EcoWatch, The Explorers Journal, El Mercurio, Ladera Sur)
“Fuentealba”, Chilean Navy
    • Nadia Politis Mella (Autonomous University of Chile)
Yelcho Station (INACH)
    • Andrea Navarro Gezán (IDEAL Center, EFE, CNN, Chilevision)
The preliminary evaluation is positive, increasing the number of press releases in local, national and international media, and with greater relevance in them of the institutions that support and carry out the Antarctic activity in Chile. The selected professionals have the commitment to publish the resulting material throughout the year 2019.
