Scoping Workshop: Towards Implementing an Antarctic Regional Climate Centre Network

An Information Paper submitted by WMO
Background

The World Meteorological Organization1 (WMO) is fostering the establishment of Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) for the Polar Regions. Significant progress has already been achieved in the Arctic region, where an Arctic RCC-Network (ArcRCC- Network) commenced a demonstration phase in May 2018 (https://arctic-rcc.org/). WMO has endorsed the initiative to establish an Antarctic RCC-Network (AntRCC-Network) through a survey and scoping process, and invited the support of the concerned WMO Members, as well as other relevant stakeholders in particular the Antarctic Treaty and its Committee for Environmental Protection, SCAR and others. In order to take this forward a “Scoping Workshop on Climate Services for Polar Regions: Towards Implementing an Antarctic RCC-Network” is being organized in October 2019, in Bologna, Italy.
Regional Climate Centre Concept
WMO Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) are centres of excellence that operationally generate and provide regional climate products, including climate data, monitoring and prediction, in support of regional and national climate activities.  RCCs thereby strengthen the capacity of WMO Members in a given region to deliver better climate services to national users. While all WMO RCCs are required to fulfill certain mandatory functions, the RCC concept accommodates specific regional needs, capabilities and limitations. The RCC concept also provides options to implement a single multi-functional RCC entity or to put in place a distributed-function RCC-Network that is collaboratively implemented by a number of interested institutions. RCC responsibilities are regional in nature and designed to support national institutions, and service delivery to national users remains in the purview of national institutions. 

WMO RCCs mandatory and highly recommended functions, and the relevant designation criteria are part of the Manual on the Global Data-processing and Forecasting System (WMO-No. 485) annex to WMO Technical Regulations. This and other related information are described at http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/rcc/rcc.php 

Based on the descriptions of formally designated RCCs provided in WMO Technical Regulations, the potential PRCC functions under consideration would be based on:

Mandatory Functions
    • operational activities for long range forecasts (LRF);
    • operational activities for climate monitoring;
    • operational data services to support LRF and climate monitoring; and
    • training in the use of operational RCC products and services.

Highly Recommended Functions
    • climate prediction and climate projection;
    • non-operational data services;
    • coordination functions;
    • training and capacity development; and
    • research and development.

The above generic functions allow PRCCs to facilitate, inter alia :

    • strengthened collaboration on polar matters;
    • specific regional products such as sub-seasonal forecasts because seasonal prediction skill may be low in the polar region;
    • development of sector-specific products; 
    • stereographic projections including improved imagery (e.g. satellite);
    • activities for user engagement such as regional and national climate outlook forums, during which users can learn about the RCC products.
Regional Approach to Climate Services
Climate experts agree that the sensitivity of the Polar Regions is an issue of global significance. Rates of melting have the potential to dramatically affect sea levels, with implications for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and low-lying coastal areas, including heavily populated deltas inhabited by hundreds of millions of people. Monitoring and long-range projections of these phenomena are making a significant contribution to policy formulation and implementation at national, regional and global levels. Polar climate monitoring and projections inform the adequacy of the current goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to limit warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels; and these climate data also inform the establishment of national commitments in support of climate agreements.
Scoping Workshop on Climate Services for Polar Regions: Towards Implementing an Antarctic RCC-Network
A “Scoping Workshop on Climate Services for Polar Regions: Towards Implementing an Antarctic RCC-Network” will be held in October 2019 in Bologna, Italy.

As an essential pre-requisite to determine the way forward for the implementation of an Antarctic RCC-Network, the WMO Secretariat will conduct a survey to define WMO Members and others interest in climate services for the Polar Regions. A similar survey was sent to COMNAP (Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs). The results of these surveys will be analyzed to ascertain the activities, services and products Members and other stakeholders would consider being mandatory or highly recommended functions of the proposed Antarctic RCC-Network. As part of the survey, the concerned WMO Members are also invited to indicate their interest and capacities in contributing to RCC-related functions, or in carrying out research and developing capacities applicable to the Antarctic region. The surveys also elicit existing mechanisms for interaction with users. The survey responses received by the WMO Secretariat will serve as the starting point for discussion at the Scoping Workshop.

Objectives of the Workshop
This Scoping Workshop will facilitate the engagement of WMO Members and others interested in climate services for the Antarctic region, including representatives from operational, research and user communities to take the first steps towards development of an implementation strategy for an Antarctic RCC-Network, including the possibility of it taking the form of an internationally implemented collaborative network by;

    1) Exploring opportunities and challenges relating to Antarctic polar climate monitoring and prediction services and the underpinning data inputs; and
2) 	Building on the survey results to hone the Antarctic RCC-Network concept, including the priority functions of the Antarctic RCC-Network and the implementation strategy.
Participants 
Participants in the Workshop will include various stakeholders in Antarctic climate matters, representatives of Antarctic Treaty members that are involved in the operational activities on the development and delivery of products and services, and are interested to contribute to Antarctic RCC implementation. The workshop will also include experts from research community, and selected representatives of user sectors and policy domains. A list of potential participants will be developed in consultation with relevant WMO Constituent Bodies, partners etc. to include a variety of stakeholders and ensure the right mix of expertise with interests in the Polar Regions is present, including:
    • Subject matter experts on Polar regions;
    • representatives of Antarctic Treaty members that are involved in operational activities;
    • WMO Members with an interest in Antarctica;
    • relevant scientific bodies, international and intergovernmental organizations;
    • relevant experts from WMO Technical Commissions, Regional Associations and Secretariat; and 
    • a selected number of user representatives.
Expected outcomes 
    1. Appraisal of opportunities and challenges including governance aspects relating to development and delivery of climate services in the Antarctic Region, including climate data, monitoring and prediction aspects, and in identifying the associated user needs;
    2. Scoping of the Antarctic RCC-Network concept, provisional structure, and implementation:
        a. List of Antarctic RCC Network priority functions;
        b. Description of the Antarctic RCC-Network implementation strategy;
    3. Identification of Member capacities to engage users at national and regional levels and to deliver Antarctic RCC-Network services for their benefit; 
    4. Recommendations on the next steps towards the establishment of an Antarctic RCC-Network.
