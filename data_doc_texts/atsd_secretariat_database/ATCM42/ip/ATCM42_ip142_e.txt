Report on IAATO Operator Use of Antarctic Peninsula Landing Sites and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, 2018-2019 Season
Information Paper submitted by IAATO 
Introduction
IAATO remains committed to reporting to the CEP and ATCM information on IAATO Operator Landing Site and ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines use. This information paper presents data collected by IAATO from IAATO Operator Post Visit Report Forms for the 2018-2019 season. No non-IAATO visits are included in this analysis.
Additional information on IAATO operator activities can be found in ATCM XLII IP140 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2018-19 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2019-20 and on the IAATO website (www.iaato.org).
Antarctic Peninsula traditional ship-borne tourism 
Antarctic tourism continues to be primarily focused on traditional commercial ship-borne tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula, which accounts for over 95% of all landed activity.  
Figure 1 provides a comparison of the factor increase in different aspects of this activity (number of passengers, ships, voyages, landings made and sites used). With the exception of the motor yacht Betanzos, all traditional commercial ship-borne tourism with landings to the Peninsula during the 2018-19 season was conducted by IAATO Operators, it is believed that this information is representative of actual activity levels.

Comparing the 2018-19 season with the previous peak season of 2017-18, the following trends are visible:
    • The growth and recovery in the number of passengers taking part in traditional ship borne tourism to the Peninsula following the global recession has been steady since 2011-12, with the previous peak season 2007-08 total (31,352) surpassed by the 2016-17 season total (33,580).  The 2018-19 total of passengers from ships making landings in the Antarctic Peninsula (44,303) has surpassed the previous 2017-18 season total (41,517). In part this is due to vessels being operated with higher passenger capacity, with all vessels benefiting from the current world economic strength and operating at near-full passenger capacity for the whole season. Additionally, visitor operations continue to expand into the ‘shoulder’ seasons, resulting in an increased number of voyages (see below). 
    • Following the previous decline in IAATO ships operating in the area, from 33 in 2007-08 to 20 in the 2011-12 season, there has been a steady increase, with 32 SOLAS passenger vessels making landings in the Peninsula during the 2018-19 season. One new SOLAS vessels joined the IAATO fleet during the 2018-19 season – a return of the Icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov.  This vessel Operated as IAATO Category 1 (13-200 passenger).
There has been an 10.5% increase in the number of voyages (from 293 during the 2017-18 season, to 324 during the 2018-19 season).  This is likely reflective of the popularity of air/cruise tourism which negates the need for four to five days per voyage outside Antarctic Treaty waters and the expansion into the early season with the return of the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov season.
    • There was a 1.4% increase in the number of  actual landings made from last season (2,679 to 2,717).  This number is lower than what might be consistent with the increase in voyages. Possible reasons for this is Operators responding to the discussions on managing for growth by moving away from simply making traditional landings but rather focusing on making the voyages a more  holsitic Antarctic experience thereby offeringmore non-landed activities like ship cruising, small boat cruising, kayaking, and ship cruising.  
    • There was a 12% increase in the number of landing sites used since last season (166 to 187). This is likely due to favourable ice conditions south of the Lemaire Channel and south of the Antarctic Circle in the later part of the 2018/19 season, as well as Operators seeking less frequented sites for alternative activities such as small boat cruising and kayaking. 
Specific Landing Site Use
Appendix 1 Table 1 lists the 20 most-visited sites in terms of landings made, for the 2017-18 season. 
The top five sites (Goudier Island, Cuverville Island, Neko Harbour, Whalers Bay and Halfmoon Island) accounted for 28% of landings made during the season. The top twenty most visited sites accounted for circa 68% of the landings, with the top 25 landing sites accounting for circa 73% of the landings. 
These percentages illustrate a focus of activity at a small number of sites indicate the trend of landings concentrating at a few popular sites remains consistent. See also ATCM XXXIX IP 104 Patterns of Tourism in the Antarctic Peninsula Region: A 20-year analysis.
All of the most-visited sites are covered by site specific management plans, either through ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines or National Program management through their proximity to stations. 
Appendix 2 illustrates the total number of landings made per day at all sites within the Antarctic Peninsula during the 2018-19 season. Landings occurred in the Antarctic Treaty Area from 11 October 2018 – 02 April 2019 (a total of 174 days).  This increase in the number of days (up from 151 for the 2017/18 season) was, as noted above, largely due to the operation of the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov making early season visits to the emperor penguin colonies. 

As in previous seasons, there is variation in levels of activity; for example, in the peak season the highest number of landings made on any one day (02 January) was 41, while the lowest number in the same period was 16 landings (18 January). These peaks and troughs are remarkably similar to last season indicating that the increase in activity has been spread across the season rather than intensifying pressure during the peak season.  
Additional tourism statistics will be made available on the IAATO website (https://iaato.org/tourism-statistics).
Use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines 
An assessment of the use of the sites covered by the ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines was conducted through feedback directly from field staff and an analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms.  Appendix 3 illustrates the total number of known landings made at sites covered by ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines, including a listing of the number of occasions the daily visitation limits were met. 

Co-ordination between IAATO field staff remains very effective. Analysis of the Post Visit Report Forms indicates that the daily limits set in the site guidelines were honoured during the 2018-19 season. 
Conclusion
The information extracted from the ATCM Post Visit Reports shows that overall tourism levels have increased from the peak season of 2017-18, as highlighted in ATCM XLII IP140 IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2018-19 Season and Preliminary Estimates for 2019-20 are likely to exceed these numbers during the 2019-20 season. The increase is not uniform however, with a few sites continuing to receive the majority of the increase, and others seeing a decrease in activity. The pattern of concentrated increase is believed to be explained by the popularity of these sites for their reliable access and ease of visitor management. The other areas where increases have been observed (length of season and increase in number of sites used) are due to seasonal anomalies such as the use of an Icebreaker vessel early season and pack ice extent later in the season allowing visits to other areas. 
All of the top twenty landing sites on the Peninsula are managed by ACTM Visitor Site Guidelines or through National Program Management guidelines. 
IAATO will continue to provide information annually to the CEP and ATCM on its Operators’ activities. In addition, IAATO Operators remain interested in gaining a better understanding of the use of ATCM Visitor Site Guidelines by non-IAATO visitors.
