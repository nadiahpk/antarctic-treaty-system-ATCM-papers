R/V Xuelong Collision with Iceberg during Marine Investigation in the Amundsen Sea， the Southern Ocean
Information Paper submitted by China

Summary
Due to the severe weather condition, R/V Xuelong collided with an iceberg at local time 15:47 on January 19, 2019 during the research investigation in the Amundsen Sea (69°59.9′S，094°04.2′W) when she was voyaging at a speed of three knots (5.56 km/h). No passengers aboard were injured. After inspection, it’s concluded that the vessel was slightly damaged with no negative impact on navigation. 
Background
On January 13, 2019, R/V Xuelong arrived in the Amundsen Sea and began to conduct comprehensive marine investigation at the planned 25 stations along 5 cross-sections. On January 18, 2019, Xuelong completed all the operations of the 12 stations in the clear water area and sailed to the intensive sea ice area to carry out the investigation of the remaining 13 stations. 
Incident
On January 19, the vessel headed to the No. A8-07 station at the speed 8 knots in the environment of less than 2000-meter visibility and floating ice around. At local time 15:45, when R/V Xuelong was normally navigated by the officer on watch and able seaman on duty, it was found that ice floe blocks of bigger size covered with thick snow were floating around and the two shipborne radars were working in good condition with no iceberg detected. With the development of heavy fog (visibility less than 200 meters), the officer on watch kept a sharp lookout by radar and telescope when the iceberg was suddenly found right in front of the vessel through the telescope, only 100 meters away. Based on the quick judgement that the ship could not evade the iceberg by course alteration. In order to protect the ship to the greatest extent, the officer on watch decided to keep the present course and order the ship’s engine full astern, so that the allision would be met only between the rigid bow and the iceberg. At local time 15:47 R/V Xuelong bumped against the iceberg with its bow at position 69°59.9′S，94°04.2′W. The speed at the moment of allision was 3 knots due to the large block of floe-ice surrounding the iceberg slowing down the advance. After allision, R/V Xuelong was steered back to the safe water and no passengers aboard was injured during the course. 
Ship Inspection
A safety inspection was conducted on the vessel immediately. It was found that, ship’s power facilities running properly, main engine, generators and its shafts in normal condition, communication system and aids to navigation in good order, no abnormal in the ballast tanks and tanks for bunker. Besides about 400 cubic metres ice and snow of 250 tons piled on the forecastle deck, through the drone launched to look into the bow area, it was found that fore mast and its breakwater surrounding crushed under the ice and snow.  A ROV was deployed to detect the ship’s bow, astern and side under water, no damage was found there. Then, the captain directed the crew to clean the snow and ice piled on the forecastle deck, and double check the facilities in the correspondent area, no further damage was detected. The vessel was generally in good condition to proceed its mission.
Through entire examination when returning to China, it was found the damage caused by the incident to the vessel is consistent with what was detected by the on-site inspection.
International Cooperation on evacuation operation of expeditioners onboard
Though preliminary safety inspection suggested that the vessel was generally in good condition to proceed its mission, it’s decided that the expeditioners should be evacuated as soon as possible to avoid any risks. It’s China’s great appreciation that 24 Chinese expeditioners were evacuated out of Antarctica from Ross Sea area to the port of Lyttelton, New Zealand on board of Araon with the kind help of Republic of Korea (Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of ROK, Korean Polar Research Institute) and some other Chinese expeditioners disembarked Xuelong in King George Island and flied back to home via Punta Arenas and Santiago with the kind help of Chile (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile, PDI). During the process of evacuation operation, New Zealand and COMNAP secretariat also provided valuable assistances. We believe that it would be a good example of symbolizing the spirit of Antarctic cooperation. 
Analysis of Incident
The reasons for the incident are analyzed as below:
    • environment: particularity in the Amundsen Sea
    • Due to non-uniform spatial distribution of sea ice, large size of ice blocks covered with thick snow as well as the sea ice above the water was high, vessel had to proceed with higher speed to push the floe-ices away, which could cause echo on the radar.
    • High concentration icebergs with great difference both in shape and size, mixing with sea ice, blocked the vision. Therefore, it was very difficult to distinguish between the iceberg and floating ice by radar.
    • Weather in this area changed rapidly. Under the influence of low pressure in the Amundsen Sea and warm current, air humidity was high with sudden dense fog, resulting in reduced visibility and difficulty to maintain a proper lookout on board.
    • technology and equipment
    • The vessel was equipped with 2 sets of Sperry Radar on board, but could not be used to locate icebergs effectively from the floe-ices in this area.
    • personnel
    • It was the first time for CHINARE to implement investigation on board of R/V Xuelong in the area where the incident happened, and very little knowledge could be available for reference. The crew were lack of experience on prediction of unknown risk in this area as well.
