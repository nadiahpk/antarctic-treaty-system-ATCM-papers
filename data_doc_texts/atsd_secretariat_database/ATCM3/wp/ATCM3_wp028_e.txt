AGENDA ITEM NO. 8

QUESTIONS CONCERNING MEETINGS OF EXPERTS
Draft recommendation proposed
by the New Zealand Delegation

The representatives recommend that their Governments
agree that specialists' or technical meetings may be called
either in accordance with the recommendation of a Meeting
held under Article IX of the Treaty or as a result of
consultations through diplomatic channels between the
Governments entitled to attend such meetings.  In cases
where such a meeting is called in accordance with a
recommendation of a Meeting held under Article IX of the
Treaty, that recommendation should lay down the terms of
reference of the meeting and the destination of its
suggestions or recommendations.  In other cases, these
details should be agreed upon before the meeting takes
place.
