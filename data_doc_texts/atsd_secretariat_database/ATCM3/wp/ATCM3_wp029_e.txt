QUESTIONS CONCERNING MEETINGS OF EXPERTS

(SUBMITTED BY SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION AS SECCND IARA-
GRAPH TC DRAFT RECOMMENDATION PROPOSED BY NEW ZEALAND
DELEGATION)

The Representatives recommend further that, if 
at such meetings it should be necessary to discuss subjects
having financial implications, such discussions should 
take place on the clear understanding that no Government
will thereby be committed to any expenditure unless and 
until it has specifically agreed to it.
