Mr. Chairman,                              

Ladies and Gentlemen,                      


Allow me to associate myself with the congratulations 
that have been addressed to you, Mr Chairman; your election 
is a guarantee of success.                 


In the name of the Norwegian Government, I have the 
honour of expressing to the Belgian Government, which you 
represent Mr Chairman, my sincere thanks for the generous 
hospitality that it has shown in organizing the third consul-
tative meeting in your fine capital. Allow me to compliment 
Belgium for her glorious traditions of Antarctic exploration, 
traditions which are constantly maintained by increasing action.


For her part, Norway has interests in the Arctic as 
well as in the Antarctic. Traditionally, historically even, 
we have important interests in both hemispheres. Concerning 
antarctic exploration, we thought it best to concentrate upon 
the study of experience which we have already acquired in 
Queen Maud Land.  In any case, we hope to be able to undertake 
other tasks, and we think that the fact that we have experience 
in both polar regions could be of service to exploration in 
general.

Mr Chairman, we hope to hold a useful and successful 
consultative meeting that will mark a new stage in this 
friendly co-operation that the Antarctic Treaty began.

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
