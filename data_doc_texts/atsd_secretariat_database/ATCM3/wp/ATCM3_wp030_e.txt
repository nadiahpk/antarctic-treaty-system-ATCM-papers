        (c)     Driving vehicles unnecessarily close (e.g.

time these Agreed Measures become effective, the above 
activities, except those set forth in (a), (e) and (f) may 
be permitted where necessary to the supply and operation of 
such stations.

3.      Governments shall take all reasonable steps towards 
the alleviation of pollution of the waters adjacent to the
