AGENDA ITEM N° 9

PROPOSAL OF THE UNITED  STATES OF  AMERICA

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE IX OF THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY

The US agrees with the intent of the Australian
proposal in Doc/Pl4 but believes it does not go far enough.
In our view all contracting parties to the Treaty should
approve measures that have been adopted.

The US therefore proposes that the Recommendation
be amended to read as follow:

"The Representatives recomend to their Governments
that, since measures approved by Contracting Parties entitled
to participate in meetings held in accordance with Article
IX of the Treaty are so much a part of the overall structure
of co-operation established by the Treaty, other States already
accede to the Treaty and States which hereafter
accede to the Treaty be encouraged to approve these measures."
