United States Draft Proposal for a
Recommendation of the
Exchange of Information on Aviation

The Representatives, taking into account Recommendation

their Governments that they exchange information on airfield

operating conditions and limitations, available radio aids to
navigation, radio communications facilities, and instrument
landing facilities, and in sufficient detail that an aviator
may make a safe landing when necessary.
