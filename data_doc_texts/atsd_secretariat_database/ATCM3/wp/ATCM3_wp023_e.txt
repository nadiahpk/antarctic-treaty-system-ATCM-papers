determine the degree to which the recommendations
by the Washington Specialists' Meeting have been

radio communications in the future, taking into account
all the requirements of the Governments concerned, of
their expeditions, stations, teams, ships, and
aircraft;

(c)  reach an agreement, through diplomatic channels and in
the course of this year, upon the date, place, and
