DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON OIL POLLUTION:

United Kingdom Proposals:

The representatives, bearing in mind the International
Conventions of 1954 and 1962 on the Prevention of Pollution
of the Sea by Oil, and recognizing the interest of the
Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation in
this subject, recommend to their Governments that they
inform the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organisation of the urgent need to find a solution to the
problem of oil pollution in the Southern Ocean, in order
to prevent further harm to wild life in the area of the
Antarctic Treaty.
