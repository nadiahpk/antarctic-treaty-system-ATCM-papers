STANDING COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY

dated April 3, 1964:

Recommendation proposed by U.K.:

"The Representatives, recalling Article III of the
Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations I-V of the First
Consultative Meeting, welcome the decision of the World
Meteorological Organisation to establish a Standing
Committee on Antarctic meteorology. They note that the
establishment of this Committee is conditional upon the
approval of the Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty:
accordingly, they recommend to their governments that, if they
have not already done so, they inform the Secretary General
of the World Meteorological Organisation that they approve
the establishment of this Standing Committee."
