PELAGIC SEALING AND THE                  
TAKING OF FAUNA ON PACK ICE              

The representatives, at the time of adopting the 
Agreed Measures on the Conservation of Fauna and Flora,
1.  Considering that appropriate voluntary regulation of 
pelagic sealing or the taking of fauna on pack ice is of 
great importance for the fulfillment of the purposes and 
principles of these Measures;

2.  Recommend to their Governments that this matter be 
considered further by them on as broad a basis as practicable 
in preparing for the Fourth Consultative Meeting at Santiago, 
with a view to its inclusion on the Agenda for the Fourth 
Consultative Meeting;

3.  Recommend to their Governments that when ships of 
their nationality engage in pelagic sealing or the taking 
of fauna on pack ice south of 60° South Latitude, each 
Government voluntarily regulate these activities to ensure 
the survival of any species being taken and to ensure that 
the natural ecological system is not seriously disturbed.
