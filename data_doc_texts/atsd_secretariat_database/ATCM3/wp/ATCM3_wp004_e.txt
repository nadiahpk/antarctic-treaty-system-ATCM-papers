PELAGIC SEALING

The following is a tentative United Kingdom proposal
for dealing with the problem of animals on pack ice
it might take the form of a recommendation of the
Consultative Meeting or other appropriate forum:

"Each Government shall prohibit within the treaty area
pelagic sealing from any ship registered in its territory".

Australian proposal:  "Each Government shall prohibit
within the treaty area pelagic sealing from any ship
registered in its territory or the taking of any indigenous
animals or birds whatsoever in the area south of 60o south
latitude".

Note:  "Pelagic sealing" means killing or capturing for
commercial purposes any member of the order Pinnipedia
on floating ice or in the sea.
