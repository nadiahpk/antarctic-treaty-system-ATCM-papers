DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON OIL POLLUTION
PROPOSED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION

The representatives, bearing in mind the International
Convention of 1954 and the amendments thereto adopted in 1962
on the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, and
recognizing the interest of the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organisation in this subject, recommend to their
Governments that they inform the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organisation of the urgent need to find a
solution to the problem of oil pollution in the Southern
Ocean, in order to prevent further harm to fauna and flora
in the area of the Antarctic Treaty.
