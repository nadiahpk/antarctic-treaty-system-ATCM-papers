Item 3 on the Agenda.

NOTE FROM THE SECRETARIATE.

Proposal by the World Meteorological Organization to set 
up a permanent committee for meteorology in the Antarctic.

By letter on June 25 th 1963, Mr D.A. DAVIES,
Secretary General of the W.M.O., asked for the agreement of
the Belgian Government, as a signatary of the Antarctic Treaty,
on the subject of establishing a permanent committee for
Antarctic meteorology.
Copies of the letter and its annexes accompany this note.

                           BY AIRMAIL              25 June 1963

Sir,

I have the honour to refer to the decisions of the World Meteorological Congress concerning the co-ordination of meteorological activities in the Antarctic and to invite your attention, in particular, to Resolution 29 (Cg-IV) relating to the establishment of a Standing Committee for Antarctic.  A copy of this resolution is attached for ease of reference.

The terms of reference of the Standing Committee are given in detail in the resolution and will not therefore be repeated in this letter.

I would, however, invite your attention to the decision of Congress regarding the composition of the Standing Committee. You will see from the resolution that the Committee will be composed of Members of the Organization which are contracting parties entitled to participate in consultative meetings under the Antarctic Treaty.

You will note also from the resolution that I am requested to notify Members which are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty and to invite their agreement to the establishment of the Standing Committee. Since your country is a signatory to the Treaty, I have accordingly the honour to request your agreement to the establishment of the Standing Committee. When I have received notification from all the countries concerned, I will inform you of the establishment of the Committee and will take the necessary steps for the Committee to commence its works.

In view of the composition of this Committee, there will, of course, be perfect co-ordination between the activities of the Committee and those which may be undertaken within  the framework of the Antarctic Treaty itself and, in these circumstances, I trust that your Government will find it possible to notify me at an early date of your agreement to the establishment of the Committee.

Accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

(D.A. Davies)
Secretary-General

interested in Antarctic meteorology ;

DECIDES ;

1) That a Standing Committee of Congress on Antarctic
meteorology may be established composed of the Members of the

      programmes for ships plying in the Antarctic ;

c)   To co-ordinate schedules of meteorological observa-
      tions by meteorological stations and ships in the
      Antarctic and to develop the most appropriate schemes
      for collection and dissimination of meteorological
      data for operational purposes ;

d)   To develop and decide on the regional coding pratices
      which are to be applied in the Antarctic ;

e)   To study problems relating to instruments and methods
      of observation peculiar tot the Antarctic ;

METEOROLOGY IN THE ANTARCTIC

THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,

NOTING :

1) the recommendation I - V adopted by the consultative
meeting of the signatory Members of the Antarctic Treaty, and the
fact that twelve members of the Organization now have the right
to take part in meetings of the Antarctic Treaty group, and
consequently are directly concerned in the development of meteoro-
logy in that region ;

2) the useful work which the Scientific Committee for
Antarctic Research performs in furthering scientific research in
the Antarctic, and the fact that the W.M.O. has been asked to
nominate a representative with the SCAR ;

CONSIDERING that the surface and altitude meteorological
observations, made in the Antarctic, their assembly, diffusion
and utilization by meteorological services, for both practical
ends and scientific research, should be coordinated by those
Members of the Organization concerned ;

DECIDES to set up a group of experts nominated by the per-
manent representatives of those members of the Organization who
execute Meteorological programmes in the Antarctic ;

the duties of this group of experts shall be the following :

a) to intensify further the programme of surface and altitude
observations in the Antarctic, particularly for the benefit
of shipping in that region ;

b) to recommend time tables and programmes of meteorological
observations for the Antarctic stations and ships, and to
draw up appropriate plans for assembling and diffusing
meteorological findings for practical purposes ;

2.

c) to study instruments and methods of observation, taking into 
due account  the severe conditions that prevail in the 
Antarctic ;

d) to study, when necessary, questions relating to the organi-
zation of meteorological services ( information and fore-
casts ) in the Antarctic region, with the view of providing 
meteorological assistance to whalers, shipping, aviation and 
the Antarctic expeditions organized by various countries ;

e) to keep itself informed about proposals by SCAR and other 
international institutions concerned with the Antarctic,
and, where indicated, to recommend such proposals, and 
the appropriate measures to be taken, to the Executive 
Committee or, with the approval of the President of the 
Organization, to Members represented in the group of 
experts ;

f) to coordinate the scientific programmes for meteorology in 
the Antarctic and to draw up the programmes for scientific 
consultations ;

g) to keep itself informed about the progress in the International

Australian permanent representative ;

EARNESTLY REQUESTS the group of experts to work in 
close collaboration with the Organization's technical 
commissions.

inating the WMO and SCAR activities in relation to meteorology 
in the Antarctic, in conformity with the terms of the present 
resolution ;
3.
