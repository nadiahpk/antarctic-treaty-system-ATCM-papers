AGENDA ITEM N°9

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE IX OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
RECOMMENDATION PROPOSED BY THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DELEGATION

The Representatives recommend to their Governments      
that, since the Recommendation approved by the Contracting
Parties entitled to participate in meetings held in accordance
with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty are so much a part of
the overall structure of cooperation established by the Treaty,
any new Contracting Party whose Antarctic activity entitles
it to participate in such meetings should be urged to accept
these recommendations and to inform other Contracting Parties
of its intention to apply and be bound by them.

The Representatives recommend further that existing
Contracting Parties and any new Contracting Parties other
than those entitled to participate in meetings held in ac-
cordance with Article IX of the Treaty may accept these re-
commendations and inform other Contracting Parties of their
intention to apply and be bound by them.
