The representatives further recommend that Governments whose expeditions use any refuge hut or cache should report as rapidly as possible on any such use.  They should also furnish an estimate of the amount cf supplies which remain available and a report about the condition of the refuge after use.

In addition they should:

(a) Ensure that supplies available at these refuges are used only under emergency conditions.

(b) To the extent possible, and as early as possible, replenish the supplies consumed and inform the authorities who maintain the refuge of the action taken.
