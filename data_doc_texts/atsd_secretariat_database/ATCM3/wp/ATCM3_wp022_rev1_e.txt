AGENDA ITEM NO. 9

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE IX, PARAGRAPH 2,
OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY.

Submitted by the South Affrican Delegation to
replace Document P.22, which is herewith withdrawn.

Representatives recomend to their Governments that
any new Contracting Party, whose Antarctic activity entitles
it to participate in the meetings held in accordance with
Article IX (1) of the Antarctic Treaty, should be encouraged
to accept the Recommendation already ap?roved by the other
Contracting Parties entitled to participate in such meetings.
This encouragement might include appropriate arrangements to
inform the new Contracting Party of the Recommendations then
in force, and to request a written reply as to whether it is
able and willing to accept and implement those Recommendations.
