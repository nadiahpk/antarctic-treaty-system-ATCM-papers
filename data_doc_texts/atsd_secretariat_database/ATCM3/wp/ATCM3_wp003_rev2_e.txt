AGENDA ITEM NO.1         

U.S. PROPOSAL CONCERNING SCAR     
PROTECTION OF FAUNA AND FLORA.    

Recognizing the initiative already taken by the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) on
matters relating to the conservation of fauna and flora
in the Antarctic, and considering its role as defined in
recommendation I-IV, the Representatives agree that SCAR
should be encouraged to continue its interest and to
prepare reports from time to time on this subject, and
especially at this time on the matters that should be
listed in the Annexes of the Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Fauna and Flora in the Antarctic.
