PELAGIC SEALING AND THE
TAKING OF FAUNA ON PACK ICE.

The Representatives, at the time of adopting the
Agreed Measures on the Conservation of Fauna and Flora,

1.      Considering that appropriate voluntary regulation
of pelagic sealing or the taking of fauna on pack ice
is of great importance for the fulfillment of the purposes
and principles of these Measures;

2.      Recommend to their Governments that this matter
be considered further by them on as broad a basis as
practicable in preparing for the Fourth Consultative
Meeting at Santiago, with a view to its inclusion on the
Agenda for the Fourth Consultative Meeting;

3.      Recommend to their Governments that when ships of
their nationality engage in pelagic sealing or the
taking of fauna on pack ice south of 60° South Latitude,
each Government voluntarily regulate these activities to
ensure that the natural ecological system is not seriously
disturbed.
