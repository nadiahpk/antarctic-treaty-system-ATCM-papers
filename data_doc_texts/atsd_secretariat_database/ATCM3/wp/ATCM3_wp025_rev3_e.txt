The Representatives recommend to their Governments that

any new contracting party entitled to participate in such
meetings should be urged to accept these recommendations and

apply and be bound by them.

The Representatives recommend further that their
governments agree that Contracting Parties and any new

in meetings held in accordance with Article IX of the Treaty
may accept these recommendations and inform other Contracting
Parties of their intention to apply and be bound by them.
