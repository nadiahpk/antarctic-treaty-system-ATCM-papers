AGENDA ITEM N° 8

Questions Concerning Meetings

of Experts

Working Draft Recommendation presented by
the Australian Delegation

Meetings under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty
may be called either in accordance with a recommendation
of a previous Article IX meeting or as a result of consul-
tations (for example, through diplomatic channels) among
the Governments entitled to participate in Article IX
meetings.  In either case, the terms of reference of the
meeting should be agreed in advance it being understood
that the procedures for dealing with any recommendations
and/or reports emerging from the meeting must conform with
the provisions of Article IX and any other relevant Articles
of the Antarctic Treaty.  Governments should seek to avoid
any burdensome or unduly complicated procedures in calling,
conducting or pursuing the results of Article IX meetings.
They should seek to ensure that any action arising from
Article IX meetings ( for example, the bringing into effect
of any recommendations ) is carried out as speedily as
practicable, bearing in mind that this might sometimes mean
that all recommendations arising from a particular Article
IX meeting might not necessarily be approved by a Government
