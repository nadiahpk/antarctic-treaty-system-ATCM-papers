Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
Antarctic Flora and Fauna

PREAMBLE

The Governments participating in the Third Consultative
Meeting under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty,

Desiring to implement the principles and purposes of the
Antarctic Treaty;

Recognising the scientific importance of the study of
Antarctic flora and fauna, their adaptation to their rigorous
environment, and their interrelationships with that environment;

Considering the uniqueness of these flora and fauna, their
circumpolar range, and particularly their defencelessness and
susceptibility to extermination;

Desiring by further international collaboration within the
framework of the Antarctic Treaty to promote and achieve the
objectives of protection, scientific study, and rational use of
these flora and fauna and

Having particular regard to the conservation principles
developed by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR) of the International Council of Scientific Union,

Have, pursuant to Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, agreed
on the following measures for the conservation of Antarctic flora and
fauna.

ANNEX

SCHEDULE  A

Specially Protected Species

The following species are designated in accordance 
with Article III, paragraph 5:

Ommatophoca rossi, Ross Seal

(°) L Elephant seal_7

Notes and comments

(°) U.S. proposed addition

SCHEDULE  B

Specially Protected Areas

The following areas are designated in accordance 
with Article V, paragraph 1:

Green Island

(Lat. 65° 19'S, Long 64° 10'W )

See Admiralty chart 3573, 1960. Argentine chart 107,1949.corrected 
to 1953 (unnamed islet in Isbtes Barthelot). Chilean chart I502,1982.
This small, low island, measuring about 800m.x500m. the northernmost 
of the Berthelot Islands (Isbtes Berthelot), is one of the 
richest areas of moss and lichen development so far discovered in 
the Treaty Area. It constitutes a special ecological community, 
not yet recorded elsewhere, and is therefore worth strict preser-
vation from interference until more information is available.
