Recommendation proposed by U.K.

The Representatives, recalling and reaffirming
Recommendations I-I, I-IV and I-V of the First Consultative
Meeting, and noting the decision of the World Meteorological
Organisation to establish a Standing Committee for the
Antarctic, recommend to their governments that they give
consideration to the importance of ensuring that the
Standing Committee is made fully aware of the views of the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and of national
committees on Antarctic research on the questions which it
is to discuss.
