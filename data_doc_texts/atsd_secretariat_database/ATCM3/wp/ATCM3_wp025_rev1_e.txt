AGENDA ITEM N° 9

PROPOSAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

The U.S. agrees with the intent of the Australian
proposal in Doc-P14 but believes it does not go far enough.
In our view all contracting parties to the Treaty should
approve measures that have been adopted.

The U.S. therefore proposes that the Recommendation
be amended to read as follows:

"The Representatives recommend to their Govern-
ments that, since measures approved by Contracting Parties
entitled to participate in meetings held in accordance
with Article IX of the Treaty are so much a part of the
overall structure of co-operation established by the
Treaty, other States already Contracting Parties to the
Treaty and States which hereafter accede to the Treaty
be encouraged to accept any or all of these measures and
to inform other Contracting Parties of such acceptance".
