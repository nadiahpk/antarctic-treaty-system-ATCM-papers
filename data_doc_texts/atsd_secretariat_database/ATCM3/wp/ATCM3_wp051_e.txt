ADDRESS GIVEN BY MR van der ESSEN,
VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE BELGIAN DELEGATICN.

Mr. Chairman,
Gentlemen,

The Belgian delegation wishes to thank those friendly
delegations who have spoken in praise of Belgium. It hopes
that the welcome in Brussels will be worthy of that which
the Australian and Argentine Governments gave us at the first
consultative meeting.

It is in a spirit of earnest co-operation that the Belgian
delegation undertakes the work of the 3rd Consulta-
tive Meeting.

Belgium has taken the responsibility of preparing it.
But I do wish to say that this has been a most pleasant
task, especially because of the spirit of friendly colla-
boration that has never ceased to guide all those present
at the preparatory meetings. It has been a pleasant task,
but an easy one too, because the Belgians have been lucky
enough to have Mr Roberto GUYER present at the meetings as
representative of Argentina. Mr Guyer acquired vast exper-
ience during the preparation of the Buenos Aires meeting,
- 2 -

and by his unsparing advice he has been of great help 
to us.

I should like to take this occasion of thanking 
him, and also the other representatives at the preparatory 
meetings.  The Belgian delegation is convinced that the 
friendly collaboration shown at these meetings will be 
maintained throughout our more official meeting.

We cannot but rejoice about this.
