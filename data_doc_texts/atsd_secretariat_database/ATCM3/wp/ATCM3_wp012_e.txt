Item 8 on the Agenda.

Questions concerning meetings of experts.

Recommendation proposed by Great Britain ( see
following page ).
(Specialist Meetings)

U.K. proposed recomendation,dated April 3,1964.

The Representatives, believing that it is desirable
for representatives of the contracting parties to meet from
time to time for discussions on specialist or technical
matters having to do with the working of the Antarctic
Treaty, recommend to their governments that the following
principles should apply to the status of such meetings, in
the absence of anything to the contrary:-

    (a)     A Specialist (or Technical) Meeting is called
only in accordance with the Recommendation of a
Consultative Meeting.  This Recommendation should lay
down any particular conditions which might apply to
its terms of reference and the nature of its report.

    (b)     Its report, including any suggestions or
recommendations which may be made, shall be advisory
in character;  it shall be sent to each Government
entitled to participate in Meetings under Article
IX of the Antarctic Treaty.

    (c)     As soon as possible after its receipt, each
such government shall inform the other governments
of its intentions with regard to the report.  Whilst
not under any obligation to implement the report,
it is expected that, in the ordinary course of events,
governments would wish to begin implementation before
the next Consultative Meeting.

    (d)     The host government of the Specialist Meeting
shall ensure that its  report is brought to the attention
of the next Consultative Meeting.

    (e)     The Consultative Meeting may incorporate the
suggestions or recommendations of the Specialist
Meeting in a Recommendation of the Consultative Meeting.
