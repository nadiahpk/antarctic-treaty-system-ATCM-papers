AGENDA ITEM 7b

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT — THE ROLE OF EIA GUIDELINES IN UNDERSTANDING “MINOR” AND “TRANSITORY”

Part 1 — Background

At ATCM XXI the Parties discussed ways of further advancing the understanding of "minor" and "transitory" in the context of the environmental impact assessment process. The meeting accepted the offer by Australia to coordinate intersessional work amongst Parties to analyse the usefulness of existing environmental impact assessment guidelines, to seek feedback from experienced environmental impact assessment practitioners, and to collate the information for presentation at this meeting.

Australia invited prospective participants (via AEON) to take part in the work and to forward their EIA guidelines (if any) for consideration by the contact group. The term "guidelines" was taken to include the descriptive approach as well as EIA proformas that may be in use. Parties were also asked to indicate whether they used the COMNAP Guidelines, however there were no responses in this respect.

The following Parties expressed interest in participating in the intersessional work: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom.

The following guidelines and proformas were provided:

•     "Australian Guidelines for Preparation of Initial and Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations" — Australian Antarctic Division;
•     "Guide to Environmental Impact Assessment of Activities in Antarctica" — UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Polar Regions Section;
•     "The Antarctic Environmental Assessment Process, Practical Guidelines" — Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs, 1992;
•     Proforma guide from Argentina; and
•     Proforma guide from New Zealand.

In addition, XXI ATCM WP35 (submitted by New Zealand) and XXI ATCM XXI Inf 55 (submitted by Argentina) were referred to in addressing this issue.

Part 2 — Treatment of “minor” and “transitory” in the guidelines

None of the guidelines examined attempted to define “minor” and “transitory”.

The guidelines provided, together with advice from participating Parties and information provided in recent ATCM papers, suggest that Parties do not intend the guidelines to provide a methodology for evaluating the level of significance of the impacts they identify. There is, however, clear agreement between the guidelines regarding the information required to be compiled in an EIA, and the general structure in which it should be presented so that the level of significance can be determined. There is a strong suggestion that if the required information is provided an appropriately qualified assessor will be able to make a reliable assessment of significance.

Broadly the process suggested by the guidelines is consistent between the guidelines and comprises three essential steps:

→     (a) Description of the activity

It is essential to understand a proposed activity at the level of necessary to enable accurate prediction and evaluation of its impacts.

The guidelines are specific about the information required to describe the activity. Some guidelines suggest a definition of “activity” to assist authors of EIA understand the scope of their task. There is, however, little guidance as to the temporal and spatial aspects of the definition. Neither is such guidance provided in Annex I. (Note that some guidance is provided in Annex II in the context of permits for taking or harmful interference with native flora and fauna, although there is no suggestion that this can be applied to EIA or is indicative of a particular level of impact in EIA terms).

The UK guidelines provide indicative lists of activities likely to result in an impact at each of the three levels. XXI ATCM IP 55 (Argentina) cites information papers from previous ATCMs which have sought to develop this approach, which has generally not been taken up by the ATS.

⇒     (b) Description of the receiving environment

An appropriately detailed knowledge of the receiving environment is essential for an accurate prediction of impacts and, therefore, assessment of their significance.

While Annex I does not specifically require the description of the receiving environment in an IEE, it is implied in the words of Art 2.1(b), “consideration of … any impacts” and Annex I states that IEE “shall contain sufficient detail to assess whether a proposed activity may have more than a minor or transitory impact”.

In apparent recognition of this, guidelines have picked up the Annex I requirement for CEEs (Art 3.2(b) refers to “a description of the initial environmental reference state”), and included it with varying degrees of elaboration for IEEs as well. This is clearly the case with the UK and Australian guidelines, but less so with the COMNAP guidelines. The suggested approaches to description accord with the environmental values outlined in Article 3 of the Protocol, and are considerably expanded in the case of the Australian guidelines. In addition, the COMNAP guidelines provide supplementary definitions of the terms “environment” and “initial environmental reference state”, although it is unclear whether these contribute to the effectiveness of the process.

The guidelines provided suggest the use of quantifiable data where possible (for example in lists, maps, and matrices) and where no concrete data are available they acknowledge the value of intuitive and subjective judgment that will stand scrutiny.

$\Rightarrow$ (c) Describe the impacts

A comparison of predicted impacts across a range of activities in a range of environments should yield a practical consensus definition of “minor” and “transitory”. For this to occur, it is important that impacts be assessed and described with similar language, qualitative and quantitative.

The COMNAP guidelines suggest describing the “expected nature of the impacts as well as their extent, duration, intensity and probability”, and their analysis using “state-of-the-art methodologies and …appropriate expertise, experience, empirical evidence, results from previous studies and monitoring.”

The UK guidelines take this further by suggesting “maps … checklists and matrices” and citing formally published specialist advice.

The Australian guidelines offer a list of environmental values on which impacts should be measured, which accords with the values set out in Article 3 (and Annex V).

The various guidelines provide:

“The expected impacts as well as their extent, duration, intensity and probability – resulting from the proposed….should be described” (COMNAP)

“The expected nature of the impacts at both the local and regional level as well as their extent, duration, intensity and probability … should be examined and discussed” (Australia)

“Will the activity give rise to particularly complex, cumulative, adverse, large-scale or irreversible effects?” (UK)

The guidelines examined do not address the evaluation of the significance of the impacts identified in this stage, such as is suggested by ATCM XXI WP35 (NZ).

Indeed, the guidelines and comments received indicate a clear intention to allow the definition of significance to be made case by case, influenced as appropriate by expert opinion and public consultation in the case of the higher level assessments.

Part 3 — Further work

In their introduction, the COMNAP guidelines state that “provision should be made for [this document’s] continual review”.

The explanatory guidelines and proformas developed by some Parties have codified the EIA process to some extent, however the terms “minor” and “transitory” remain undefined. Such definition, at least for the purpose of ensuring consistency within reasonable limits, might be achieved through the wide examination of EIA documents and comparative methodologies throughout the ATS.

Part 4 — Conclusions

1.    The guidelines offer effective and consistent advice on the preparation of EIA, including method, scope and amount of detail to be included. This indicates that there reasonable consistency can be expected between the EIA of the Parties using the guidelines that were studied.

2.    The guidelines do not attempt to define the terms “minor” and “transitory”. The guidelines also do not suggest or discuss methods of assessing level of impact.

3.    There is insufficient evidence from this exercise to indicate whether de facto there exist agreed practical definitions of “minor” and “transitory” across the ATS.

Part 5 — Future work

4.    The CEP may wish to propose to the ATCM that a working group be established to continue the work described above, and undertake further work, including:
    •  identify the aspects of current EIA procedures that constitute “best practice”;
    •  explore the consistency of evaluation by Parties of EIA;
    •  consider whether EIA procedures should be further codified; and
    •  revise the COMNAP Guidelines (or develop new guidelines) in the light of Parties’ extensive EIA experience since they were first issued. New or revised guidelines might usefully incorporate:
        —  suggested methods for assessing the level of impact,
        —  discussion of temporal and spatial aspects of the key EIA parameters,
        —  model assessments, and
:
— guidance derived from a statistical analysis of EIA to date.
