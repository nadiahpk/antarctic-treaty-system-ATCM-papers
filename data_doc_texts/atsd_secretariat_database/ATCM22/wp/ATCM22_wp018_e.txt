International Code of Safety for Ships Navigating in Polar Waters -
The Antarctic Issues

Summary
1. It is important to ensure that The International Code of Safety for Ships Navigating 
in Polar Waters (the Polar Code) takes Antarctic aspects into account.

2. Antarctic Treaty Parties could be in the position to provide IMO with constructive 
input based on their Antarctic experience.

3. It is suggested that ATCM XXII initiates a process to agree on common input to 
IMO.

Introduction
4. The International Code of Safety for Ships Navigating in Polar Waters (the Polar 
Code) was first discussed in an Antarctic context at ATCM XXI in Christchurch, 
New Zealand (1997).

5. At this meeting the Polar Code's relevance to issues related to emergency response 
action and contingency planning in Antarctica was noted (cf. para. 19 of the final 
report from ATCM XXI).

6. Furthermore it was considered appropriate that the technical issues raised by the 
Polar Code should be discussed by ATCM XXII (cf. para. 98 of the final report 
from ATCM XXI).

7. ATCM XXI also agreed to invite an IMO expert to attend ATCM XXII to take part 
in the discussions on this subject (cf. Resolution 1 (1997)).

8. Reference is made to ATCM XXII WP 13 (submitted by COMNAP) regarding 
technical concerns raised by COMNAP and ATCM XXII WP 17 (submitted by 
Norway) which gives a general introduction to the Polar Code.

9. Furthermore it should be noted that a Polar Shipping Code made applicable to 
Antarctica could be in accord with the requirements of the Environmental 
Protocol's Annex IV, Article 10 regarding the design, construction, manning and 
equipment of ships.

Antarctica in the draft Polar Code
10. The draft Polar Code aims to provide a standardized framework for design, 
equipment and operation of vessels in polar waters. There are advantages of 
having the Polar Code to apply to Antarctic waters, as the Code would provide a 
framework for shipping in Antarctica that would apply to all ships irrespective of 
their flag.

11. In considering whether the Code should apply to both the northern and southern 
polar waters, it was evident to the Polar Code working group that there are 
significant differences between the regions, but that there are also similarities that 
have provided the basis for the bi-polar approach.

12. However, much of the technicalities in the Code have been drawn from Arctic 
experience, due to the fact that it is in the north that a number of circumpolar 
nations have developed distinctly different ship classification systems, navigational 
systems, and operational constraints. Consequently the applicability of the Polar 
Code to Antarctica has in some aspects been based on assumptions which have not 
taken the Antarctic conditions fully into account.

13. The draft Polar Code is now undergoing an internal review process within IMO. 
This process is expected to last for two years, and will include several technical 
sub-committees of IMO. This is an opportunity for Treaty Parties to evaluate the 
draft Code with respect to Antarctic issues, and to provide the IMO process with 
suggestions which are seen necessary in order to ensure that the Polar Code has a 
realistic approach to Antarctica. The Treaty Parties have unique experience with 
ship operations in Antarctica, and could be able to contribute valuable input to 
IMO.

14. This working paper draws attention to three issues that Norway feels should be 
reflected appropriately in the final Polar Code. Furthermore, a concrete proposal is 
put forward suggesting how the Antarctic Treaty Parties could proceed in order to 
ensure proper consideration of these issues, ensuring constructive input to the IMO 
process.

Areas of concern from an Antarctic viewpoint

15. Although Arctic and Antarctic shipping challenges to a certain degree are 
comparable, in many respects Antarctic challenges are unique to Antarctica. It is 
important that these challenges are reflected appropriately in the bi-polar shipping 
code.

16. In considering the applicability of the Polar Code to Antarctica, three areas of 
possible concern have been recognized:

- Technical concerns. The following aspects need further consideration:
    ♦ The fact that Arctic and Antarctic ice are different in texture and formation.
    ♦ The fact that ship traffic in the Antarctic area is specialized (research vessels, 
      cruise ships and fishing vessels) and that the vast majority of vessels in 
      Antarctica is confined to summer only operation
    ♦ The fact that IMO has already given Antarctica special consideration with 
      regard to oil pollution, noxious liquids and garbage

$\diamond$ The very long distances to established ports and safe anchorage, and also very long distance to nearest rescue possibilities in case of emergency

- Legal/political concerns. Is the unique legal regime in the Antarctic, i.e. the Antarctic Treaty System, appropriately considered and reflected in the Polar Code? Is it necessary in any manner to specify and strengthen the appearance of ATS in the Polar Code?

- Environmental concerns. Does the Polar Code reflect the existing environmental regimes in Antarctica, and if not, how can the existing environmental requirements better be incorporated into the Polar Code. Reference here is e.g. made to:

    $\diamond$ Environmental Protocol, CCAMLR
    $\diamond$ Other relevant legislation, i.e. Special area requirements of MARPOL 73/78

17. COMNAP has initiated an evaluation of the above aspects, and have provided ATCM XXII with information in this regard (cf. ATCM XXII WP 13). COMNAP identifies several areas for consideration (cf. paragraphs 7.1 through 7.14 in WP 13), and furthermore proposes a series of concrete proposals (e.g. development of guidelines for training and for communication, as well as including reference to existing COMNAP guidelines for fuel transfer, etc. in the Polar Code).

Proposal

18. In order to ensure that the proposed International Code of Safety for Ships Navigating in Polar Waters properly takes into account unique Antarctic aspects, it is important that the Antarctic Treaty Parties also participating in the IMO-process, evaluate the draft text and provide constructive input to the IMO review process.

19. Such an input may have more weight if the Treaty Parties evaluates the draft text together and provide IMO with joint input.

20. Consequently, the following two-step approach is proposed for the Antarctic Treaty Parties to provide constructive input to the IMO process.

Step I:
- Treaty Parties, which are IMO Members, should ensure that Antarctic issues are fully addressed during the IMO review of the draft Polar Code.

Step II:
- COMNAP should further elaborate on the technical issues identified in paragraphs 7.8 and 7.9 in WP 13, i.e. develops the suggested guidelines

- At ATCM XXIII, the Polar Code should be further discussed with a view to producing a collective position for transmission to IMO (based on recommendations from, for instance, an intersessional contact group)

- ATCM XXII should inform IMO of the above identified process, and should 
furthermore offer the collective input from ATCM XXIII for IMO to consider in 
due course.

Draft Resolution ____ (1998)

International Code of Safety for Ships Navigating in Polar Waters
Antarctic Issues

The Representatives,
Noting the proposed International Code of Safety for Ships Navigating in Polar
Waters (Polar Code), being developed by the International Maritime Organization
(IMO);

Recognizing the benefits of having a Code of Practice for Ship Safety for vessels
operating in Antarctic waters;

Noting also that a Polar Code should meet the requirements of Article 10 of Annex IV
to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty;

Recognizing also, the substantial work COMNAP has done on this issue, reflected in
ATCM XXII WP 13;

Recommend that:

1. Those Treaty Parties, which are IMO Members, should ensure that Antarctic issues
are fully addressed during the IMO review of the draft Polar Code.

2. COMNAP should elaborate the technical issues identified in paras. 7.8 and 7.9 of
its ATCM XXII WP 13; develop the suggested guidelines on Training
Requirements for ships officers and crew and on navigation/communication
equipment for vessels operating in Antarctic waters; and report back to ATCM
XXIII on these issues;

3. At ATCM XXIII, the Polar Code should be further discussed with a view to
producing a collective position for transmission to IMO.

4. ATCM XXII should inform IMO of the above identified process. and should
furthermore offer the collective input from ATCM XXIII for IMO to consider in
due course.
