Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP): Establishment Issues

Introduction

1. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty establishes the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP). The task of the CEP is to provide Antarctic Treaty Parties with technical, scientific and environmental advice on the Protocol.

2. Further progress has been made on CEP establishment issues since ATCM XXI. Final Draft Rules of Procedure have been prepared and circulated by Norway for consideration and adoption at ATCM XXII. However, despite the operation since 1994 of the Transitional Environmental Working Group (TEWG), only limited work has been done on the substantive role and functions of the CEP once established.

3. In support of the Final Draft Rules of Procedure, New Zealand hopes that the following reflections on the role and functions of the CEP may be helpful to Parties.

Relationship with the ATCM

4. The success of the CEP will depend largely on how it operates within the Antarctic Treaty System and the relationship that it develops with the body politic, the ATCM. The CEP is not an executive or decision making body. The ATCM should establish clear work priorities for the CEP and approve its annual work programme. It would also be helpful for the ATCM to provide guidance on long term strategies and objectives for the implementation of the Protocol towards which the CEP could work.

Relationship with SCAR and COMNAP

5. To date SCAR has been tasked by the ATCM to provide expert advice on a wide range of Antarctic scientific, technical and environmental issues. As the range and complexity of issues considered by ATCMs have grown, more and more matters which now fall within the competence of the CEP, have been referred to SCAR - which has often responded to this through its Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation (GOSEAC). With SCAR's focus on scientific issues, this has not always been an appropriate arrangement. Similarly, COMNAP has willingly helped to fill in gaps on environmental matters.

6. The establishment of the CEP is an opportunity to reassess the role of SCAR and COMNAP in respect of Protocol-related issues. The Protocol provides for SCAR and COMNAP to attend meetings of the CEP as Observers. SCAR and COMNAP's expertise and advice will greatly benefit the deliberations of the CEP and any subsidiary bodies it may form. It is important, however, to establish the primacy of the CEP as the ATCM's advisory body on the Protocol, with SCAR and COMNAP providing advice as required.

Relationship with CCAMLR

7. The relationship between the ATCM and CCAMLR may also benefit from reassessment. The Convention is an integral part of the Antarctic Treaty System. The Commission's experience in ecosystem management is of particular relevance to the ATCM as it grapples with the tasks set by the Protocol. Given its experience and international reputation in the management of marine resources and information technology, the CCAMLR Scientific Committee will have information of benefit to the CEP. It is desirable to establish a sound working relationship between the two bodies. This was envisaged in the Protocol (Article 11(4)) and in Rule 4 of the Final Draft Rules of Procedure for the CEP.

Role and Functions 1: what will the CEP do?

8. Article 12 of the Protocol lists the functions of the CEP. These can be broadly summarised as:

#    provision of advice on implementation and effectiveness of the Protocol;
#    provision of advice to improve the implementation of the Protocol; and
#    provision of advice on information needs related to environmental protection.

9. Within this, the key function of the CEP is to advise on the development of procedures to implement the Protocol and oversee these as directed by the ATCM. This might require the development of standardised procedures for Parties, followed by monitoring and review processes. The CEP might also be expected to assess the effectiveness of these procedures and make recommendations to the ATCM on the need to strengthen, update or improve them.

10. The CEP (and Parties in general) need to develop an information exchange system that is efficient, timely and appropriate. The establishment of the CEP provides the ideal opportunity for Parties to consider what sort of information is required, and how it is to be collected, stored and disseminated.

Role and Functions 2: how will the CEP do this?

11. The Final Draft Rules of Procedure for the CEP provide for an annual meeting "in conjunction with" the ATCM. With ATCM agreement it may also meet between annual sessions "in order to fulfil its functions". On its own initiative, the CEP may establish open-ended contact groups, and with ATCM approval it may establish subsidiary bodies. These could be named "Technical Groups" with clearly defined work programmes set by the CEP.

12. Annual meetings provide the CEP with the opportunity to review progress in the preceding year and to establish its priorities for the forthcoming year. These priorities would be mandated by the ATCM. On this basis, the CEP would develop  
2
its work programme. The practice of the CCAMLR Scientific Committee may prove 
a useful model in this respect.

13. The costs of any intersessional meetings would need to be borne by Parties 
hosting the meetings - as is presently the case with ATCMs, SCMs and meetings of 
experts - or by consortiums of Parties, given the absence of any CEP (or indeed 
ATCM) contributory funding mechanism. An important cost factor will be whether 
intersessional meetings of the CEP or Technical Groups will operate in a single 
language or require translation/interpretation in all four Treaty languages.

14. In order to assist paper flow for ATCMs, it may be helpful to establish a new 
category of Papers other than ATCM Working or Information Papers for the CEP. 
Papers intended for the CEP might be termed “CEP Papers” to distinguish them 
from papers intended for the ATCM. Again, the practice of CCAMLR’s Scientific 
Committee may be helpful in this respect.

Representation

15. The role of the CEP is to advise the ATCM on the implementation of the Protocol 
as directed by the ATCM. It is therefore important that those attending the CEP, and 
in particular its elected officers, should have suitable scientific, environmental or 
technical competence.

Key Issues for the CEP: Prioritisation

16. The development of standardised procedures across the full range of Protocol 
obligations and technical annexes will be a considerable undertaking for the CEP. 
Focussing the initial work programme on a smaller set of priority objectives will 
enable progress to be made. Inevitably, progress on these and subsequent objectives 
will be incremental.

17. The following might be considered by the CEP as useful priorities for a work 
programme to be placed before ATCM XXII:

*   application and implementation of EIA procedures to provide for 
    coordinated and consistent standards;
*   the priorities for, and scope of, response action contingency plans;
*   a Data Management system;
*   state of the Antarctic environment reporting; and
*   follow-up on outstanding TEWG issues - such as environmental monitoring 
    and protected area management.

Application and Implementation of EIA Procedures

18. This is the key component of the Protocol and forms the basis of its 
environmental management regime. Because of the delay in the Protocol's entry into 
force, however, Parties have had to develop their own procedures for EIA in relative 
isolation. The CEP will need to establish some order and consistency from existing 
practice. Intersessional discussion of EIA aspects by the open-ended contact groups 
working between ATCM XX / ATCM XXI and ATCM XXI / ATCM XXII 
(coordinated by New Zealand and Australia respectively) has provided a useful 
basis for progressing this work.

Response Action Contingency Plans

19. The increasing number of visitors to Antarctica and the emergence of 
"adventure" and "eco" tourism brings with it the added risk of accidents and 
disasters - both human and environmental. The CEP should begin discussions on 
contingency response action plans, which Parties are required to establish under 
Article 15 of the Protocol. This may best be done on a sectoral or regional basis. The 
Antarctic Peninsula area would seem to be a priority in this respect given that the 
greatest number of tourists visit this region. It would be helpful if Parties with 
particular interests in management of visitors to the Peninsula region could develop 
some thoughts on response contingency planning. The Ross Sea region is another 
area where Parties could readily collaborate on similar plans.

Data Management

20. Establishment of the CEP also offers the chance to re-examine the exchange of 
information within the Antarctic Treaty - in regard to what information is required 
and when it needs to be provided. The establishment of the CEP and the additional 
Protocol-related reporting requirements will otherwise exacerbate existing problems 
of information dissemination and paper flow.

State of the Antarctic Environment Report

21. Article 12 (1) (j) of the Protocol requires the CEP to provide advice on the state of 
the Antarctic environment. It is important for the CEP to establish a framework 
under which this advisory function can be met. A State of the Antarctic Environment 
Report could provide a timely response to this need. New Zealand has tabled a 
Working Paper on the intersessional contact group's work on this matter.
