EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTION AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING

SUBMITTED BY THE UK

Introduction

1. The issue of Emergency Response Action and Contingency 
Planning, is the subject of Article 15 of the Protocol and the 
related provisions of Annex IV, and was discussed at ATCM XXI.

2. The basis for discussion was paper XXI ATCM/WP9 
(submitted by the UK). The outcome was Resolution 1 (1997).

3. The Resolution calls on Parties to introduce contingency 
plans for their research stations and vessels in Antarctica, to 
carry out contingency exercises and to report back to ATCM XXII 
on the outcome of those exercises.  In addition COMNAP and 
IAATO were asked to report on:

- their respective guidelines for contingency plans;

- the extent to which those plans have been put in place; and,

- plans for future work.

Implicitly, IMO was requested to address the Code of Polar 
Navigation.

4. The background to emergency response action was set out 
in XXI ATCM/WP9. A considerable amount of technical work has 
been accomplished, eg the annexes to the 1992 COMNAP Report 
(see Annex B (vi) pgs 264-269 of ATCM XVII, and its annexes 
3-5 on pgs 311-347) on:

- Recommended Procedures for Fuel Oil Transfer at Stations 
and Bases;

- Recommendations for Spill Prevention and Containment of 
Fuel Oil at Stations and Bases;

1
- Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning.

5. However, despite the direct relevance of the above to 
Article 15 and Annex IV, the ATCPs have, so far, not taken any 
action on these documents.  They have been neither endorsed nor 
converted into guidelines or legally-binding instruments.

6. In consequence Resolution 1, 1997 remains the only action 
taken on Emergency Response Action by the ATCPs since adoption 
of the Protocol in 1991.

7. The Protocol and its Annexes I-IV are now in force. 
There is therefore a treaty obligation on Parties to implement 
Article 15, and its related provisions.

8. A crucial element of Resolution 1 is that which 
requires ATCM XXII, in the light of reports, discussions, 
papers, and other available information, to:

-  "... review the issue of emergency response action and 
contingency planning with a view to implementing further 
the provisions of Article 15, and the related provisions 
of Annex IV to the Protocol..."

9. There is a pressing urgency to this task.  Accidents or 
emergencies in Antarctica giving rise to environmental damage 
have occurred, and could occur again at any time.  Yet a 
comprehensive framework to deal with such accidents or 
emergencies remains to be developed.

Objective

10. This paper elaborates further on issues raised by XXI 
ATCM/WP9 and Resolution 1, 1997.

11. It makes proposals (and appends a draft Resolution) as to 
how further progress on this important matter might be made. 
It also proposes a means by which the various elements of 
emergency response action might be integrated.

Provisions of Article 15: issues that need to be addressed

12. The objective underlying Article 15, and its related 
2
provisions is to minimise the risk of accidents/emergencies 
that could give rise to environmental damage in Antarctica; 
but that should they nevertheless occur, that their impact on 
the environment is also minimized.  If these objectives are 
to be met, then a number of inter-linked issues need to be 
addressed.  In sequence they are to:

-   (1) Identify, and prioritise the risks that might give 
rise to accidents/emergencies;

-   (2) Adopt preventative measures (to prevent an 
emergency/accident happening in the first place);

-   (3) Adopt contingency plans (in case, despite  (2) above, 
emergencies/accidents occur anyway);

-   (4) Undertake response action as the practical 
implementation of (3) above.  (This may need to be 
developed further to include remedial measures).

13. Issue(1) is a technical exercise that might be 
commissioned through COMNAP.

14. Issues (2) and (3) require (a) the endorsement and 
adoption of existing guidelines and recommendations, and (b) 
the identification and formulation of further guidelines and 
recommendations.

15. Issue (4) requires existing obligations to be further 
elaborated.  These would require Parties to undertake response 
action in respect of emergencies or accidents.

(1)  The Assessment of Risk

16. Although the identification and prioritisation of risk is 
a fundamental consideration in developing preventative measures 
or contingency plans, the relatively limited scale and range 
of activities taking place in Antarctica suggest that any 
assessment of risk need not be overly elaborate in its 
approach.  A pragmatic analysis is all that is required. 
This would identify those activities capable of giving rise 
to emergencies/accidents.  It would also prioritise those 
activities in terms of the likelihood of emergencies/accidents 
happening, and the potential scale of resulting environmental 
impact should they occur.

3
(2) Preventative Measures

17. The Protocol and its Annexes are somewhat lacking on the matter of preventative measures that would reduce the chances of emergencies/accidents occurring that might give rise to environmental damage. However Article 10 of Annex IV is preventative in nature, dealing as it does with the design, construction, manning and equipment of ships. Similarly, the heading of Article 12 of that Annex indicates the intent of Parties to address prevention even if the details were not subsequently elaborated.

18. Yet preventative measures are a vital element in reducing the risk of environmental damage from emergencies/accidents. The saying that "prevention is better than cure" has a particular significance in this context.

19. In recognition of this, some of the existing documents prepared by COMNAP/SCALOP in 1992 are in effect preventative measures. For example the recommendations on fuel oil transfer, and spill prevention and containment. The draft Polar Shipping Code also falls into this category. Providing guidelines on the design of bulk fuel tanks and their bunding, or stipulating standards for vessel design, construction and equipment reduce the chance of emergencies/accidents occurring in the first place.

20. However, additional work needs to be undertaken. Specifically:
- existing guidelines and recommendations need to be endorsed and adopted by the Consultative Parties;
- they need to be periodically reviewed and revised;
- existing drafts (eg the Polar Shipping Code) need further development before endorsement;
- further work on addressing other activities in Antarctica requires identification and elaboration eg further guide-lines addressing refuelling procedures for vehicles, aircraft and vessels.

4
(3) Contingency Plans

21. Existing guidelines on contingency plans (eg COMNAP/SCALOP, 1992) are confined to oil pollution incidents as those are seen as having the greatest potential for impact on the environment. They address facility plans and regional area plans, or shipboard oil pollution emergency plans.  Here to, such plans need review, revision, and endorsement and adoption by the ATCPs.  Further plans, addressing emergencies/accidents (other than oil pollution) where potential environmental impact is an issue, also need to be identified and formulated.

(4) Response Action

22. Neither Article 15 nor its related provisions specify in detail the obligations to undertake response action. Elaboration of further provisions may be useful in this regard in order to clarify the responsibilities of Parties and their operators.

Comprehensive Approach: Integration

23. The logical end product of developing the above is likely to be a series of lengthy, technically complex documents in the form of guidelines or recommendations.  If adopted on an ad hoc basis, these documents would present a fragmented and uncoordinated approach to emergency response action.

24. One means of achieving greater structure and integration might be to develop the technical elements relating to emergency response action under the umbrella of some form of "framework document".  Whether Article 15 itself, or its related provisions, would suffice in this regard is debatable.  The Article is somewhat skeletal.  It provides little guidance on preventative measures, does no more than call for the elaboration of contingency plans, and sets out few details on obligations in respect of response action.

25. An alternative might be a separate framework document that develops further the object of Article 15.  It could be succinct.  It should address the three key issues of (i) preventative measures, (ii) contingency planning, and (iii) response action.  Annexed to the framework might then be one or more Schedules which would list all documents containing provisions relevant to emergency response action.  Sections (i) and (ii) of the framework dealing with preventative measures and contingency planning might set requirements for the Parties to adhere to the obligations/provisions identified in the list of documents listed in the Schedule(s) to the framework.

5
Section (iii) of the framework could set out what should be done by way of response action (and possibly remedial measures).

26. What form such a framework document might take should be open for discussion, as should its legal status eg whether it should be held under a Measure or a Resolution, or some other mechanism.

Proposals

27. To achieve progress on emergency response action, the following proposals are put forward for consideration:

I.  That the Parties adopt a Resolution (draft attached) which would:
    - recommend that the Consultative Parties adopt the existing technical documents on preventative measures (eg fuel oil transfer, and spill prevention and containment), and contingency plans;
    - call for periodic review and revision as appropriate of such measures/plans;
    - recommend that the ATCPs involve themselves in the development of other preventative measures (eg the draft Polar Shipping Code);
    - call for the identification and formulation of other preventative measures, and contingency plans (ie plans other than those addressing oil pollution);
    - request that an assessment of risk relating to activities in Antarctic be undertaken;
    - identify further guidelines on response action, including coordination and communication (and possible remedial measures).

II. That a means to integrate the above should be introduced. It is proposed that this might consist of a brief framework document addressing the three principle issues
6
of preventative measures, contingency plans and response 
action.

28. Appended to the framework document could be one or more 
Schedules identifying the technical documents (recommendations/
guidelines) that relate to preventative measures and 
contingency plans.  Provisions within the framework would 
require that Parties and their operators adhere to such 
recommendations/ guidelines. Obligations relating to response 
action [and remedial measures] might also be included in the 
framework.

29. The intention of such a formulation would be to provide a 
coherent yet succinct elaboration of Article 15 of the 
Protocol, and its related provisions.

Draft Resolution     1 (1998)

Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning

The Representatives,

Noting ---- the provisions of Article 15 of the Environmental
Protocol, and related provisions of Annex IV, on emergency
response action and contingency planning;

Concerned to minimize the impact on the Antarctic environment
of emergencies or accidents by implementing those provisions;

Aware that the reduction of risk of emergencies or accidents
is best achieved through effective preventative measures and
contingency planning;

Recognising that initiatives relating to certain elements
of the provisions have been taken by COMNAP and IAATO;

Desiring nevertheless to ensure that comprehensive measures
are set in place:

Recommend that:

1. The Consultative Parties adopt the COMNAP/SCALOP annexes
(1992) on preventative measures and contigency plans, viz:

    - Recommended Procedures for Fuel Oil Transfer at Stations
and Bases;

    - Recommendations for Spill Prevention and Containment of
Fuel Oil at Stations and Bases;

    - Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning.

2. COMNAP/SCALOP be requested to review and if necessary
revise, as appropriate, those recommendations and guidelines
and that those recommendations and guidelines be kept under
periodic review by COMNAP/SCALOP thereafter.

8
3. COMNAP/SCALOP be tasked to undertake a risk assessment of 
activities taking place in Antarctica with respect to their 
potential impact on the environment.  This should include an 
analysis of those accidents/incidents which have occurred over 
the past [10 years] within the Antarctic Treaty Area, and which 
could have resulted, or did result, in environmental impact.

4. Those Consultative Parties who are also Contracting Parties 
to the IMO, should provide input to the IMO on the draft Polar 
Shipping Code as it relates to shipping operations within the 
Antarctic Treaty Area.

5. COMNAP/SCALOP and IAATO be requested to (i) identify and 
formulate further preventative measures, and contingency plans 
(ie other than those addressing oil pollution);  and (ii) to 
formulate guidelines on response action that should be taken in 
respect of emergencies/accidents (including guidelines on 
coordination and communication).

6. The findings of the above commissioned work should be 
reported to the Committee on Environmental Protection at ATCM 
XXIII for evaluation and advice.

7. Consideration should also be given by the Committee on 
Environment Protection, following advice from COMNAP, to the 
desirability and feasibility of undertaking remedial measures 
in Antarctica caused by damage resulting from emergencies or 
accidents.
