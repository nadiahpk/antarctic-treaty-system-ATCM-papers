PROCEDURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT ESTABLISHED IN ANNEX I OF THE MADRID PROTOCOL, SUBMITTED BY ARGENTINA

Introduction

At XXI ATCM Argentina presented information paper 55 Elements for the interpretation of the EIA Procedures established in Annex I of Madrid Protocol. That paper raised some questions stemmed from the analysis of EIA procedures established in Annex I of the Madrid Protocol, particularly on subjects such as the applicability of Annex I and the lack of a common terminology accepted by most of AT countries.

Bearing in mind that the Protocol has already entered into force and that an adequate solution has not been found for such issues yet, the Argentine Delegation once again presents -this time as a Working Paper- those main concepts contained in XXI ATCM/Info 55, with the intention of making a contribution to the resolution of these matters.

Use of a Common Terminology

Although the fundamental problem in need of solution is procedural instead of semantic, unification of criteria with regards to basic definitions is essential, more so bearing in mind the various languages that exist within the ATS, and the different definitions that may be found of terms referred to an EIA in the abundant bibliography which exists on the matter, even within a same language. For this reason those definitions of certain concepts, as determined by the Workshops on Environmental Monitoring in Antarctica carried out by SCAR/COMNAP in Oslo (October 1995) and Texas (March 1996), can be a starting point and basic reference to be taken into account when discussing these matters. Of those definitions, the most important ones for the present discussion are:

Activity: An event or process resulting from presence of humans in the Antarctic

Output: A physical change (e.g., movement of sediments by vehicle passage, noise) or an entity (e.g., emissions. an introduced species) imposed on or released to the environment

Exposure: The process of interaction between the output and a value or resource. Output does not necessarily lead to exposure (e.g., a chemical may not to be in a biologically available form, a noise may occur when a breeding site is unoccupied).

Impact: Change in the values or resources attributable to human activity. Impact is the consequence (e.g., reduced plant cover) of an agent of change not the agent itself (e.g., acid rain). Synonym - Effect.

Applicability of Annex I

Three instances are established by Annex I for assessing the Environmental Impact of Antarctic activities: Preliminary Stage, IEE and CEE (Articles 1,2 and 3).

The first of these instances -Preliminary Stage- allows us to determine if an impact produced by a certain activity is less than, equal to or more than minor or transitory, which must be accomplished through the Appropriate National Procedures.

Although the Preliminary Stage is briefly described in Annex I, we consider that it is of great importance in this process, since it is through this phase that the depth with which an EIA has to be carried out is established. The fact that all scientific and technical working groups related to this subject within the Antarctic Treaty area are trying to define the meaning of minor or transitory impact, - which is considered the core of this stage -. proves the importance of the matter.

Following SCAR/COMNAP Workshops, the Preliminary Stage should be carried out in three steps, as shown in figure 1:

1. Phase 1 involves collecting information and/or generating it, in case it lacks.

2. Phase 2 consists of an analysis of interactions between the activity and the environment, in order to identify likely impacts.

3. Phase 3 refers to the estimation of magnitude, intensity and duration of the identified likely impacts.

There are several methodologies to undertake every step, but there are no doubts that integration of all three phases constitutes the main core of any EIA process.

According to the scheme in fig.1, once the impact level produced by the activity is determined, the activity will either proceed, or an IEE or a CEE will have to be prepared, as corresponds. (Phase 4)

Analysis now focuses on the procedures suggested by Annex I to undertake the two kinds of EIAs required. Table 2 shows a comparison of those requirements that we think are necessary to accomplish the Preliminary Stage together with those stated in Annex 1 for preparation of an IEE or a CEE, as corresponds:

Table 2: Annex I requirements for preparation of IEE and CEE, compared to those that should be considered on the Preliminary Stage.

As seen in Table 2, CEE procedures are very detailed and cover a broad field of matters, however concerning IEE, there are steps - in our opinion essential during the Preliminary Stage- that are not considered at all.

The following example illustrates the above paragraph:

Through implementing a national procedure it is determined that an activity will produce minor or transitory impacts. For this reason, an IEE is prepared, according to Article 2 of Annex I. This IEE concludes that no impacts will be higher than minor or transitory. It is possible that such a conclusion was drawn without considering essential aspects, which could have led tu a different result, i.e.:

- Description of the initial environmental reference state
- Effects of the activiry on scientific research and other values and uses
- Indirect or second order impacts
- Unavoidable impacts
- Gaps in the knowledge

From this example it can be seen that present IEE procedures work as if they had no category of their own, that is, as if they were only an abbreviated version of CEE procedures.

The Preliminary Stage -as defined in Table 2- would provide more information than an IEE -as described in Annex I- and such a fact would appear to lack coherence.

## Conclusions

In summary, the problems which are found in the application of Annex I of the Madrid Protocol are:

1. The preliminary Stage is subject to ample methodological flexibility due to the fact that Annex I strictly leaves its implementation to the Appropriate National Procedures. This can lead to some confusion, as is shown by the fact that the Antarctic Treaty System is looking for an agreed upon definition of the concepts of minor and transitory impact, in order to advise National Programmes in the implementation of their Appropriate National Procedures. The question that is therefore raised is whether the National Procedures are appropriate or not to set up EIA methodologies.

2. Steps corresponding to the carrying out of an IEE seem to be incomplete, which makes it difficult to fullfil EIA procedures in a satisfactory manner.

3. In addition, there is a wide variety of definitions of basic concepts used to implement Annex I,which may hinder CEPs analysis of EIA procedures.

For all the stated above reasons, we suggest this ATCM to recommend the Parties:

1.that a set of guidelines be established in order to provide Parties with a frame when applying to the Preliminary Stage as well as to the IEE Procedures proposed by Annex I.

2.that definitions stemmed from SCAR/COMNAP Workshops (Monitoring of Environmental Impacts from Science and Operations in Antarctica) on concepts related to Annex I be incorporated into such set of guidelines.

DRAFT RESOLUTION ....

Guidelines for the application of Annex I of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on
Environmental Protection

The Representatives,

Taking into account that the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection has
entered into force;

Considering that the proper application of Annex I on Environmental Impact Assessment
Procedures is of constant concern to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties;

Aware of the fact that Annex I leaves the implementation of the Preliminary Stage to the
Appropriate National Procedures;

Noting that there is no uniformity of criteria regarding the methodology employed in the
Environmental Impact Assessment procedures;

Also Noting that Annex I guidelines for an IEE are too general in order to determine adequate
implementation methodologies;

Understanding that the task of the Committee for Environmental Protection would be eased
through an adequate unification of EIA procedures;

Recommend:

1. That the CEP prepare a set of guidelines for the application of Annex I of the Protocol, both
during the Preliminary Stage as well as for Initial Environmental Evaluation and Comprehensive
Environmental Evaluation procedures.

2. That those guidelines embody definitions of terms related to the application of Annex I as they
were established by the SCAR/COMNAP Workshops on Monitoring of Environmental Impacts
from Science and Operations in Antarctica and consider other existing records on the matter.
