ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM: ANNEX V

SUBMITTED BY THE UK

Introduction

The Environmental Protocol, along with its Annexes I-IV,
entered into force on 14 January 1998 following ratification
by all 26 Consultative Parties.

In contrast, Annex V on "Area Protection and Management",
although adopted by Treaty Parties at ATCM XVI within two
weeks of adoption of the Protocol itself, appears to be some
way off entering into force.

Annex V is embodied in Recommendation XVI-10. It will
therefore enter into force only once it has been approved by
all Consultative Parties under the procedures of Article IX
(4) of the Antarctic Treaty. Despite urgings by Parties at
successive ATCMs the rate at which Recommendation XVI-10 has
been approved by Parties has been slower than the pace of
ratification of the Protocol. Up to ATCM XXI 11 Consultative
Parties had approved Recommendation XVI-10; a further 6
Consultative Parties had "accepted Annex V" (which the UK
presumes has the same intent). Since then (as of 3.4.98) two
other Parties have taken action to approve the Recommendation
(see Annex I).

With 7 Consultative Parties yet to approve Recommendation
XVI-10 it is unlikely that Annex V will enter into force in
the near future unless Parties make a special effort to
address this matter.

Management Plans

Once Annex V enters into force those Specially Protected Areas
and Sites of Special Scientific Interest already designated
as such, will automatically be re-designated as Antarctic
Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and be re-named and
re-numbered accordingly.

In the interim, Treaty Parties have recognised the need to
begin addressing the issue by revising the Management Plans
for those Protected Areas in the format of Annex V. But here
again progress has been slow. Of the 54 SPAs and SSSIs in
existence at the time of the adoption of Annex V, only 16 plan
revisions have been submitted subsequently for adoption;  a
mean rate of 3 revised plans per ATCM. At this rate, it
could take at least a further ten years before all existing
protected areas have revised Management Plans in accordance
with the requirements of Annex V.

1
In an effort to expedite matters, and clarify which national 
groups are primarily involved in the revision of Management 
Plans, an indicative list of proposed national attributions 
was prepared by SCAR, and circulated to all its National 
Committees (see Annex II).  This listing has been accepted by 
SCAR National Committees as a working basis on which to 
undertake revisions of existing Ma:agement Plans. The listing 
does not however set out a time-frame within which revisions 
for Management Plans should be submitted.

Until Annex V enters into force, the Antarctic Protected Area 
System will continue in an unsatisfactory interim state.  
Numerous (previous) site designations remain in existence, 
and no sites can be adopted into the new Annex V designations 
(ASPA, ASMA).  For the majority of sites there are variable 
standards of (or indeed, no) Management Plans.

Proposals

In an attempt to remedy this situation the attached draft 
Resolution addresses three issues:

i)      it calls on Consultative Parties to make renewed 
        efforts to approve Recommendation XVI-10 in a 
        timely fashion;

ii)     it proposes that the ATCM should endorse the 
        national attribution listing (Annex II) compiled 
        by SCAR (as modified);

iii)    it urges those Parties primarily responsible for 
        the preparation of revised Management Plans to 
        give urgency to this task, to prepare a timetable 
        for the submission of respective plans under 
        their responsibility, and to circulate that 
        timetable to ATCM XXIII.

DRAFT RESOLUTION

The Representatives,

Welcoming the entry into force of the Environmental Protocol, 
including its Annexes I-IV;

Conscious that this situation does not extend to Annex V 
on Area Protection and Management which was adopted under 
Recommendation XVI-10;

Aware that approval of this Recommendation requires completion 
of the procedures of Article IX(4) of the Treaty by all 
Consultative Parties;

Concerned that such approvals have fallen well behind that of 
ratification of the Protocol;

Concerned also that delay to the entry into force of Annex V 
has left the Antarctic Protected Area System in an 
unfortunate interim situation;

Desiring to see this situation rectified,
Recommend that:

1.      Those Consultative Parties which have yet to approve 
Recommendation XVI-10 under the procedures of 
Article IX(4) take steps to do so as soon as 
possible.

2.      The list of national attributions, annexed to this 
Resolution, should be endorsed; noting that the list 
identifies which Parties have responsibility for the 
preparation of revised Management Plans for specified 
protected areas.

3.      Those Consultative Parties identified in the Annex 
should prepare a timetable for the preparation of 
Management Plan revisions for those sites for which 
they have principal responsibility, and should submit 
the timetable for information to ATCM XXIII.
