PROGRESS REPORT ON ASPECTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE ASMA OF ADMIRALTY BAY

1.0 - INTRODUCTION

As a result of the agreement of the ATCPs to voluntarily comply with the text of the 
Management Plan (MP) for the ASMA of Admiralty Bay (herein called the Area) was adopted at 
the XX ATCM (Utrecht, Netherlands, 1996). Brazil, one of the countries with active scientific 
programs in the Area, was designated the coordinator for the implementation of the above 
mentioned MP.

Preliminary initiatives undertaken to implement the MP have already been described in the 
XXI ATCM INF 40, presented by Brazil in Christchurch last year. Since then, several other 
measures have been adopted to implement the MP. These measures are briefly reviewed in this 
report.

2.0- MEETINGS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MP

Two technical-scientific activities have recently been promoted by the Secretary of the 
Interministerial Commission for the Resources of the Sea (SECIRM) to review aspects of the 
application of the MP. Meetings were held in the context of the Brazilian Antarctic Programme. 
Proposals for the activities related to the implementation of the MP included in this document 
reflect only the position of scientists present at the meetings. Further discussions on the these points 
will be held in the future with the other Parties which have National Antarctic Programmes active 
in the Area.

2.1- Field meeting. An informal field meeting was held on January 26th of this year at 
Henrick Arctowski Station. The meeting had the participation of scientists from Brazil and three 
other Parties with active scientific programs in the Area namely: Peru, USA and Poland.

1
The meeting was held during a campaign developed in the last austral summer by Brazilian 
scientists. This campaign involved observation and review of practical results and problems arising 
from the implementation of the MP, since its adoption.

This included: a) review of the regulations and the code of conduct for the Area; b) inspection of 
the present state of the natural diversity and of some of the values of the Area; c) review of the 
zones of scientific and/or ecological interest within the Area listed in the MP, the need of their 
redefinition, deletion or of nomination of additional zones; d) review of procedures of 
environmental monitoring needs; e) survey of the distribution and possible removal from the area 
of drifted debris found ashore in the Area; f) study of ways of co-operation among the Parties 
with active scientific programs in the Area with a view to rationalise scientific and science support 
activities in the Area etc.

2.2 Workshop on implementation of the MP for ASMA Admiralty Bay

In order to review the effectiveness of management mechanisms included in the MP of 
ASMA Admiralty Bay, the Brazilian Antarctic Programme, through the initiative and support of 
SECIRM, a first meeting of scientists involved in research projects in the Area was held. The 
Workshop was attended by scientists from projects closely related to problems of environment 
preservation and conservation.

The Workshop was held from 7 to 8^(th) of April, 1998, at the Instituto de Geociências, 
University of São Paulo, Brazil. Besides the Brazilian participants, two scientists from the Peruvian 
Antarctic Programme were present at the meeting. The workshop took into account the results and 
conclusions of the Field Workshop held in Admiralty Bay on January 26^(th), referred to above.

This workshop was probably the first of a series of meetings that the Brazilian Antarctic 
Programme will organise with a view to evaluate the implementation of the MP and examine the 
need for its revision previous to the entering into force of Annex V to the Madrid Protocol. Some of 
the main results of the workshop are presented below.

a) Review of the text of the MP

The text of the MP and Annex I (description of physical, biological, historical features of 
the Area and of human activities, including science activities carried out in the ASMA) were 
thoroughly reviewed.

Particular attention was given to a critical analysis of regulations and elements of the code of 
conduct for the Area, particularly the restrictions to the use of vehicles and displacement of 
pedestrians, state of permanent and semi-permanent structures, and the list of zones in which 
activities should be regulated.

2
Some of the conclusions reached with regard above items are the following:

- Some aspects of physical description of the Area need revision. A satellite image 
(SPOT) mosaic of King George Island at the approximate scale 1:295,000 processed by 
the Laboratory of Antarctic and Glaciological Research, University of Rio Grande do 
Sul, Brazil, allowed a better definition of the boundaries of the ASMA. The newly 
estimated total area of the ASMA is approximately 361,15 km^(2), including 143,70 km^(2) of 
Admiralty Bay waters and an adjoining 8 km^(2) of the Bransfield Strait. Approximately 
88% of the terrestrial area is ice-covered, the ice-free area representing 31,97 km^(2).

- The meeting concluded that for the time being, it is not necessary to alter any of the 
guidelines related to operation of vehicles and displacement of pedestrians in the Area. 
The meeting, however, recognised the need for a better delimitation of areas and routes 
for displacement of vehicles and pedestrians around  the stations and between the 
stations and the isolated modules and  more strict compliance with the pertinent 
regulations in the MP.

b) Monitoring

The meeting recognised the need of designing and maintaining a program for monitoring a 
set of relevant environmental indicators and ecosystem components as an essential mechanisms for 
the adequate management of the area.

Therefore, discussions held involved the critical examination of possible key parameters for 
the Area, on the basis of the list of proposed by the SCAR-CONMAP workshops on environmental 
monitoring. A revised expanded list with comments is annexed to this document (Annex). Some of 
the parameters listed are already being routinerely measured by the Brazilian Antarctic Program. 
These include long term projects for determining levels of pollution of waters of Admiralty Bay by 
pesticides and hydrocarbons. Data obtained demonstrated  the low concentration of organochlorine 
residues in penguins, seals and krill and in the waters of Admiralty Bay. Low concentrations of 
anthropogenic hydrocarbons have been detected in Admiralty Bay waters, but values are not 
considered yet significant. A project involving the chemical and microbiological measurements of 
contamination of the bay by sewage disposal was initiated last summer.

The advantages of designing a cooperative monitoring program involving the national 
programs of Parties with activities research programs in the Area was reiterated by scientists 
present in the meeting. Planning of a cooperative monitoring program for the Area would involve 
the joint evaluation of a minimum, but effective set of parameters that can be measured by all

3
national programs involved; careful choice of methodology, and intercallibration of equipment to 
assure consistency and comparability of data. A cooperative program would also assure a more 
rational use of resources available in the national programs involved.

Design of the program must be preceded by a general survey on the present status of the 
terrestrial and aquatic environment in the Area, modelling of expected spatial distribution of 
contaminants and selection of observation stations or points.

c) Education and training

A survey performed in the context of the two meetings showed that there is awareness of the 
existence and significance the MP for ASMA Admiralty Bay among participants in the Brazilian 
Antarctic Programme.

The meetings discussed possible ways to improve even more the expeditioners knowledge of 
the MP details, regulations and code of conduct. A lecture on the main features of the MP is 
already included in the program of the training course provided to all participants in the Brazilian 
Antarctic Programme. This activity should  be emphasized and amplified. Another initiative 
suggested at the meeting involves the preparation of a short handbook on Admiralty Bay in three 
languages (Portuguese, English and Spanish) with information on the main characteristics of the 
MP and a description of the different values of the Area that MP is aimed to protect.

3.0-   FUTURE ACTIONS

This document reports on the progress of the discussion on the implementation of the 
Management Plan for the ASMA of Admiralty  Bay, in the context of the Brazilian Antarctic 
Programme only. The next step will be the discussion of this topic with all Parties that have 
National Antarctic Programmes active in the Area. This should  be achieved by an intersectional 
work aiming the elaboration of a document to be presented at the XXII ATCM.

NOTES

Two additional activities related the monitoring of habitat disruption and landscape alteration have 
been proposed by the meeting, these activities, which are partially under way  are described 
below:

a) Monitoring of plant communities.

Involves the detailed mapping, yearly, of extensive plant  communities with identification of 
plant species, in points close to areas of more intense human activity (station, pedestrian  and 
tourism routes).

Area already mapped: Keller Peninsula.

Areas to be mapped: Point Crepin (Peru and Brazil)

                  Point Thomas (Poland)

b) Monitoring of the benthic ecosystem on Admiralty Bay.

Involves the study of marine benthic communities in reference areas representative of natural 
ecosystem, as a way for detecting possible environmental impacts.

Areas selected: shallow marine, soft bottom communities (to the depth of 30m) in front of Ferraz 
Antarctic Station and Napier Rock hard bottom community.

Frequency: every 3-5 years.
