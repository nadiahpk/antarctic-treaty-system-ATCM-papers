IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Introduction

Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty requires each Party to report annually on
the steps they have taken to implement the Protocol,
including how it has ensured compliance with the Protocol
through the adoption of laws and regulations, administrative
actions and enforcement measures (see Article 13(3) of the
Protocol).

Since its report to ATCM XXI (XX ATCM/INF 15), the United
Kingdom has brought into force the remaining provisions of
its domestic legislation which implements the Protocol, ie.
Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Antarctic Act 1994. The Act is
now fully in force.  The UK legislation has also been
extended to most UK Dependent Territories, including the
Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands.

Article 17 also requires each Party to report on contingency
plans established for response to incidents with potential
adverse effects on the Antarctic environment or dependent and
associated ecosystems (see Article 15(1)(b)).  Further to
this, Resolution 1 (1997) recommends Parties to carry out
regular contingency exercises and to report on the results of
the exercises to the ATCM.

The UK carried out a disaster contingency exercise in March
1998.  A brief report of the exercise is provided below.

Antarctic Act

Section 5 of the Antarctic Act 1994 came into effect on
1 June 1997.  This prohibits British-registered vessels and
aircraft from entering Antarctica without either a permit, or
written authorisation from another Contracting Party to the
Protocol.

Section 5 does not apply to:

- a vessel or aircraft travelling to an immediate
destination outside Antarctica;

- a vessel entering Antarctica for the sole purpose
of fishing for profit.

Section 6 of the Act was brought into force on 1 October
1997.  This prohibits United Kingdom nationals from:

- drilling, dredging or excavating for mineral
resources;

- collecting any samples of mineral resources;

- doing anything for the purposes of identifying
specific mineral resource occurrences or deposits, or
areas where such occurrences might be found,
unless they hold a permit authorising such action.

Permits will only be granted under this section for:
- the purposes of scientific research;  or
- purposes connected with the construction,
maintenance or repair of a British station or of any
other structure, road, runway or jetty maintained by
or on behalf of a United Kingdom national.

To co-incide with the entry into force of the Protocol,
Sections 3 and 4 of the Act were brought into force on
14 January 1998.  This completed the entry into force of the
Antarctic Act.

Section 3 prohibits any person on a British expedition from
entering or remaining in Antarctica without a permit, or
written authorisation from another Contracting Party.

An expedition is defined in the Act as any tour or other
journey, whatever its purpose, made by one or more persons.
It will be a British expedition if:

- it was organised in the United Kingdom;
- the place of final departure for Antarctica of the
expedition was in the United Kingdom (which because
of the extension of the Act to UK Dependent
Territories includes the Falkland Islands and South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands).

Section 4 prohibits any person from remaining on a British
station in Antarctica without a permit.  A British station is
defined as a station maintained by or on behalf of a United
Kingdom national.

Other Sections of the Act were already in force.  They
include the prohibition on United Kingdom nationals doing the
following unless they have a permit, or written authorisation
from another Contracting Party:

- taking, or harmfully interfering with, fauna
and flora (Section 7);

- introducing non-native animals or plants into
Antarctica (Section 8);

- entering a Specially Protected Area (Section 9);

Section 10 of the Act prohibits United Kingdom nationals from
damaging, destroying or removing an Antarctic Historic Site
or Monument.  Section 11 prohibits UK nationals from entering
CCAMLR CEMP sites without a permit.

The Act also provides for the prosecution of offenders and
penalties for offences.

Secondary legislation, in the form of the Antarctic
Regulations 1995-1998, is also in force.  These detail the
procedures for applying for permits and the requirements for
Environmental Impact Assessment.  They also schedule lists of
Specially Protected Areas and Historic Sites and Monuments.
A list of all permits issued under the Antarctic Act 1994 
during the 1997/98 season is attached as an Annex to this 
paper.

Disaster Contingency Exercise

The UK is developing a contingency plan which establishes 
response strategies to be followed in the event of a 
disaster in Antarctica.

Based on the draft contingency plan a two day paper exercise 
was undertaken in March 1998, involving UK organisations and 
a vessel operating in the South Atlantic.  The exercise 
simulated a marine disaster involving a passenger vessel, a 
large number of passengers including several seriously 
injured personnel and a pollution incident.  Passenger 
evacuation and pollution control strategies were implemented.

The primary aim of the exercise was to test the contingency 
plan and the ability of the UK's Antarctic assets to 
respond to a disaster in the Antarctic.

Based on the findings of the exercise the contingency plan is 
to be developed further.  Emergency response exercises will 
continue to be undertaken on an annual basis.
