Ross Sea Region State of the Environment Report

New Zealand
Information Paper

Background

The Ross Sea Region State of the Environment Report was announced as a New Zealand initiative at ATCM XXI in Christchurch in May 1997. The report aims to benchmark the state of knowledge about the Ross Sea Region, to document current and potential threats to its values and to identify appropriate responses to protect these values.

The report will focus on the terrestrial, marine and air environments of the Ross Sea Region and will assist in New Zealand’s implementation of the Environmental Protocol. Contributions are planned from the New Zealand and international science communities and other relevant experts.

Project Management

An Executive Committee, with membership drawn from the Royal Society of New Zealand and Antarctica New Zealand (New Zealand’s Antarctic Institute) will oversee the production of the report, including project management and editorial roles. An Officials Oversight Group will maintain an overview of the project.

New Zealand intends to consult widely with countries with a science and operational interest in the Ross Sea Region at an early stage in the development of the report and will annually update the Committee on Environmental Protection on its progress.

The report will be published by 1 December 2000 in hard copy and electronic form.

Objectives of the Report

The objectives for the report were developed by a subgroup of the New Zealand Antarctic Officials Committee and included representatives from the Ministry for the Environment, Department of Conservation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministry of Research Science and Technology and Antarctica New Zealand.

The objectives form the basis for the production of the report and will guide its preparation.

(1)  To provide a benchmark of the current state of knowledge about the Ross Sea Region environment to the year 2000;
(2) To provide a knowledge base of the Ross Sea Region to underpin the development and management of activities there;

(3) To develop parameters for taking advantage of new scientific, commercial, heritage protection, conservation, political and strategic opportunities in the Ross Sea Region;

(4) To serve as an evolutionary benchmark and a standard reference work for the future, against which human-induced change can be measured;

(5) To assist the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) in meeting its state of the environment reporting objectives under the Environmental Protocol;

(6) To provide an alerting mechanism for emerging problems and trends, especially those of a synergistic nature;

(7) To identify gaps in our knowledge critical to our understanding of the Ross Sea Region environment;

(8) To provide a base for the development of Area Protection and Management in the Ross Sea Region;

(9) To provide environmental managers and the scientific community with a basis for making informed assessments of, and judgements about, the environmental consequences of proposed activities in the Ross Sea Region; and,

(10) To identify areas and sites of environmental impact where remedial work may be required.
