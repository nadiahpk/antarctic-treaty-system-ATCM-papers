* Ice-sheet mass balance and sea-level - effects on the global hydrological cycle
The Antarctic ice sheet contains 75% of the world's freshwater reserves as ice.
Changes in the volume of the ice sheet due to interannual-interdecadal fluctuations in
snow accumulation result in small instantaneous changes in global sea level. Larger
effects on sea level can be expected from longer-term changes in mass balance;

* Depletion of stratospheric ozone
Dramatically increased breakdown of stratospheric ozone in the Antarctic Polar Vortex
is a major and very rapid environmental change that has been attributed to human
activities. This continuing process has world-wide effects, and also did much to shape
public, scientific and political attitudes to global environmental problems;

* Oceanic and atmospheric carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles - 
understanding biogeochemical cycles
Physical and biological processes in the Antarctic play major roles in determining global
atmospheric composition. Studies of biogeochemical processes in the Southern Ocean
are leading to a better understanding of environmental control of carbon cycling;

* Study of effects of changes in environmental forcing of simple 
communities
Because of their apparently simple food chains, Antarctic terrestrial and lake ecosystems
offer ideal systems for testing fundamental hypotheses on the responses of living
organisms and communities to environmental change, such as ultraviolet exposure,
water availability, temperature, seasonality, and colonization.

1.2 Present and potential impacts

* Documented local climatic warming
Meteorological and oceanographic records from the Antarctic Peninsula region indicate
that there has been an increase in air and water temperatures of at least 2.5 C in the last
50 years;

* Potential future change
Although the causes of this local warming are uncertain, it is very likely that Antarctica
and the Southern Ocean will be sensitive indicators of future global climate change;

* Loss of ice shelves
The partial disintegration of several small ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula has
been attributed to the local climatic warming. More southerly, and larger, ice shelves
remain vulnerable to a progressive rise in air and ocean temperature. This has important
consequences for the production of Antarctic Bottom Water;

* Changes in terrestrial ecosystems
Studies have shown that biological communities have responded to warming by
increased diversity and biomass, and changes in distribution;

* Hydrological cycle
Precipitation in parts of Antarctica has increased. Lake levels in the dry valleys have
increased, and lake ice thickness has decreased;

* Marine ecosystems and fisheries
Natural interannual variability in parts of the Southern Ocean influences all levels of the
ecosystem, from phytoplankton to birds and seals, and including impacts on
commercial fisheries. Such variability could also preview the likely effects of secular
climatic change;

* UV impacts
Increased ultraviolet radiation affects organisms on land and in aquatic habitats.
Primary production may be reduced, and species composition affected. Research in
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean provides information needed to assess likely impact
at lower latitudes;

* Consequences of changes in sea ice extent and thickness
Sea ice is likely to be very sensitive to climatic change. Reduction in sea ice extent and
concentration will change the albedo of the Southern Ocean, and would impinge on
deep convection and the global ocean circulation and ventilation. Sea ice is also an
important biological habitat and plays an important role in biogeochemical processes
such as the sulphur cycle, important in cloud formation.

1.3 Past environments - understanding the Earth's climate history

* Ice cores
Data from Antarctic ice cores provide information on global climate on timescales of
several 100,000s of years, indicating the changes associated with the ice age-interglacial
cycle, and the existence of abrupt changes in climate which occur over decades to
centuries. Ice cores also provide annually-resolved records of variation in temperature,
atmospheric circulation and composition, and accumulation rate;

* Sediment records
High resolution sediment records from the continental and ice-sheet margins, from the
coastal zone and from lakes provide detailed records of changes in the ice sheet, glaciers
and ice shelves over the last 20 000 years. They also contain a history of changes in
temperature, ocean circulation, coastal hydrology, sea-ice variability and biological
productivity;

* Peat deposits
Peat deposits preserve information about local climatic change and biological response.

2. GLOCHANT, its goals and achievements

GLOCHANT was established by SCAR to identify the priority areas for Antarctic and
Southern Ocean global change research. The group established several programmes to address
specific problems, but also sought collaboration with existing global change activities.

GLOCHANT now includes seven projects (listed at the end of this section), representing most
of the global change programmes active in the region. These cover physical studies on the
ocean-ice-atmosphere system, palaeoenvironmental studies, and ecological studies on impacts
and biogeochemistry.

GLOCHANT has an ongoing interaction with the World Climate Research Programme (ICSU)
and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (ICSU). This relationship promotes
Antarctic global change studies, and relates these to other regional and global studies.

GLOCHANT is fostering interaction between programmes, in order to address cross-
disciplinary problems such as the links between the palaeoenvironmental record and
contemporary processes, and the links between physical forcing and biological response.
Interaction is through shared expeditions and research cruises, and collaborative workshops
and symposia.

Amongst GLOCHANT's specific achievements and immediate targets are:

* Initiating a long-term project on sea-ice climatology, and re-processing archive sea-ice records
The ASPeCt project of GLOCHANT has completed its first field season of research to describe seasonal and geographic variation in sea-ice properties ASPeCt programme has also undertaken the processing of archive sea-ice data to make them compatible with the new climatological data;

* Producing a protocol for standardised sea-ice observations
Scientists in ASPeCt are producing a manual for ice observation, including data entry software and a CD-ROM of example images to improve the quality of data records;

* Establishing a workshop on interannual variation
Given the importance of natural large-scale variability in the physical and biological dynamics of the Southern Ocean, GLOCHANT is bringing together a diverse community of scientists to examine the problem in a workshop co-sponsored with WCRP, SCOR and IOC;

* Establishing a base for assessing recent changes in climate and the environment
The ITASE programme has undertaken a synthesis of published snow/firn/ice core records covering the last 200+ years in preparation for a series of environmental base maps that will, by the completion of forthcoming ITASE field collections, describe the changes in climate and chemical composition of the atmosphere over this period;

* Calibration of proxy and instrumental data for hindcasting critical time series
Time series that describe important global components of the climate system affecting Antarctica are relatively short (~40-50 years) and sparsely distributed. ITASE will hold a workshop that will bring together specialists in modern atmospheric processes with those collecting ice core series to develop transfer functions that will aid in the hindcasting process;

* Initiating a circum-Antarctic reconstruction of palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment and ice sheet palaeogeography throughout the last glacial cycle
The ANTIME programme has determined priority field research locations and is organising national and multinational field projects. A database of high-resolution proxy climate and environmental information is being collated from lake, coastal, fjord, and shelf sediment sequences covering the last 10 000 years. ANTIME is also driving a project with scientists working on ice cores and deep sea sediments to correlate these large datasets and establish the climate forcing mechanisms and environmental responses;

* New initiatives on terrestrial ecology and environmental change
A new programme of research in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is being formulated following on from SCAR BIOTAS. This will include studies along a latitudinal gradient to evaluate the effects of environmental variability on communities and organisms;

* Relationships between key marine species and the physical environment
The Southern Ocean regional study within GLOBEC has produced a revised science and implementation plan. Field studies, centred on krill and sea ice, and workshops are planned, with joint activities between SO-GLOBEC, ASPeCt, SO-JGOFS and EASIZ.
