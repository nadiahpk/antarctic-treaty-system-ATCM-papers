Information Paper on
EDUCATION AND TRAINING

BACKGROUND

1.      At ATCM XXI in Christchurch, it was proposed that a survey be conducted to determine the range of 
        educational and training programs undertaken by national Antarctic programs and tour operators for people 
        visiting or working in Antarctica (Final Report ATCM XXI, para 131). COMNAP and IAATO agreed to 
        collect the information and report back the results of the surveys to the ATCM XXII.

2.      Chile offered to host a workshop to discuss the education and training of people going to the 
        Antarctic and suggested that it could be held in conjunction with the SCAR/COMNAP meeting in Chile 
        during July 1998. New Zealand offered to assist Chile in the organisation of this workshop (Final Report of 
        ATCM XXI, para 134).

SURVEY RESULTS

3.      Attached is a summary of responses to the education and training survey questionnaire. The results 
        confirm that a comprehensive range of general training courses are conducted by national Antarctic operators 
        covering Antarctic legislation, environmental requirements, safety and survival, community development, 
        together with specialist courses tuned to specific activities or trades. A range of printed and videotape 
        material is used to assist in training as well as for public information.

4.      While each national Antarctic program tailors its training activities to suit the nature of its operations 
        and national culture, several programs suggested that benefits may be derived by sharing information on the 
        content and delivery of education and training courses.

FUTURE ACTION

5      A forum on education and training for Antarctic visitors and expeditioners will be conducted at the 
       COMNAP meeting to be held in Chile during July 1998. The forum will consider the results of the survey 
       and discuss what action, if any, needs to be taken.

10.  HOW DO YOU THINK EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR PEOPLE WORKING IN, OR 
VISITING ANTARCTICA, COULD BE IMPROVED?

ARGENTINA                  - Improve the creation of specific departments on education and training within 
                              the National Antarctic Programs.
                            - Assign more economic and technical resources for developing education and 
                              training courses.
                            - Improve the change of information among National Antarctic Programs.

AUSTRALIA                  - Exchange of information on training programs with other nations.
                            - Determining some common standards.
                            - Exchange of staff/visits to participate in training programs.

BELGIUM                    Improvement might be considered for tourists, through tour operators paper 
                              information.

BRAZIL                     In addition to the topics on item 5, the following items could be improved 
                              regarding education and training on Antarctic issues.
                            - inclusion of a program about sensitive areas susceptible to cumulative impacts;
                            - elaboration of a program about application and implementation of the 
                              Protocol, include the functions of the Committee for Environmental Protection;
                            - compile guidelines for use by tour operators and non-government 
                              organisations, which include: code of conduct for environmental protection; 
                              cautions to avoid interference on scientific research; care to minimising waste 
                              and pollution; and respect to the rules relating specially to protected areas.

CHINA                      It should be significant to emphasise arrival briefings, field training, job specific 
                              training, because in the actual surroundings the education and training are more 
                              impressive and direct. Station leaders and/or environment officers in the station 
                              should be even better educated and trained so they could arrange more education 
                              and training in the base.

FRANCE                     By permanent assistance of the permanent staff.

GERMANY                    The best way of course is to learn by doing under the supervision of experienced 
                              scientisits and technicians. This is much better than any formal training, which can 
                              only lay the foundations.

INDIA                      Education and training program can be improved by exchange of write-ups, 
                              brochures, video recorded cassettes, etc among the other Antarctic operators. Such 
                              an exchange of information will be useful to update and provide better logistic 
                              amenities to the visiting members to Antarctica. It would be useful to organise 
                              some 1-2 weeks training course periodically to update the knowledge which may 
                              be complementary in nature.

ITALY                      Considering the importance of training and of preparation for personnel going to 
                              Antarctica, there is certainly a need for continuous improvement. One example is 
                              some additional re-training of personnel that went through training years before.

NEW ZEALAND                 	Exchange of information between operators will allow others to benefit from areas 
                               	of expertise. For example, Ant NZ does not conduct marine field training, but if 
                               	the need arose a start point could be other programs training syllabi and 
                               	experience.

NORWAY                     	More practical and theoretical training such as snow machine driving course,

                               	how they are conducted. For instance, there could be some kind of exchange program for

                               	participation in each others preparatory courses.

                               	In the long run, there could be several benefits from such an exchange program:

                               	(1)	It could improve our respective education and training programs, if we can discuss 
                               	the contents, pedagogy etc., during such exchanges.

                               	(2)	It could increase our personal understanding of how other countries organisations 
                               	"want things done". We could then present (or even incorporate) other countries' 
                               	procedures and "cultures" in our own programs, and thereby increase the 
                               	understanding by the participants in our own expeditions of how things are done in 
                               	other Antarctic programs.

                               	(3)	It could simplify matters when "our" scientists are participating in other countries' 
                               	research programs, if we can inform them about what they could expect.

                               	There may be further benefits from exchange programs, but I think that what is stated above 
                               	should suffice to at least start discussions on this. As mentioned above, the exchange 
                               	program should primarily be aimed at the persons responsible for education and training.

                               	important, changes. We are currently reviewing some of the presentations and the 
                               	accompanying documentation.

                               	The provision of the COMNAP Visitors' Guide to the Antarctic is excellent. 
                               	Perhaps more could be presented for tourists along these lines.

ARGENTINA         | It was important for our experience to distinguish contents of courses taking into

                  | level of decision (e.g. leader of stations, head of scientific programs, head of
                  | logistics etc) it would be important to enhance topics related to management

                  | training and education is more significant and valuable than a well designed
                  | emergency response plan. The exchange of information on education and training
                  | is and would be strongly supported.
