MR. WILLIAM SHAXPER, of Stratford-upon-Avon, 
         left no known manuscripts of his plays or poems. 
         The 1623 Folio was compiled from 
         original prompt-books or from players' 
         private transcripts. 
         The texts of the plays in the 1623 Folio 
         are not always accurate. 
         Some plays were printed from 
         prompt-books that were carelessly 
         transcribed or had been used for 
         many performances. 
         Some texts show signs of having 
         been "cut" for performance. 
         The proof-reading of the Folio was 
         not always careful. 
         The result is that there are many 
         textual cruxes, some of which 
         have not been, and perhaps 
         cannot be, resolved. 
         Editors have to choose between 
         different possible readings 
         and sometimes have to 
         conjecture a reading. 
         The New Cambridge 
         Shakespeare texts have been 
         freshly edited from the 
         original-spelling texts, 
         and the textual 
         introductions and 
         apparatus are designed 
         to help readers to 
         understand the 
         basis on which 
         editorial decisions 
         have been taken. 
         The spelling has been 
         modernized, but 
         punctuation and 
         capitalization have 
         been reconsidered 
         in the light of modern 
         scholarship. 
         The New Cambridge 
         Shakespeare 
         is an 
         indispensable 
         resource for 
         anyone concerned 
         with the 
         interpretation 
         and performance 
         of Shakespeare.
SCAR REPORT TO XXII ATCM

REPORT UNDER RECOMMENDATION XIII-2
Professor A C Rocha-Campos

SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTIC RESEARCH

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SCAR is pleased to participate in XXII ATCM, welcomes especially the establishment of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), and looks forward to contributing towards its success. SCAR intends to continue its cooperation with the ATCM towards better understanding and management of the Antarctic environment by developing an effective dialogue with the CEP.

During the year 1997-98, since XXI ATCM, the SCAR Executive Committee has met in Cape Town, South Africa, 25-29 August 1997, in parallel with the annual meeting of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP). These meetings provided an opportunity for the Executive Committees to hold a joint meeting. The closer relations with the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) are strengthening cooperation, leading to more effective execution of scientific research in the Antarctic.

The Full Membership of SCAR has not changed.

SCAR continues to be active in initiating, promoting and coordinating a diversity of scientific activities, but only a few can be noted briefly here.

The SCAR Global Change Programme coordinates all SCAR global change research in the Antarctic so that there were seven individual programmes within the overall global change programme. The SCAR Global Change Programme Office is operational at the Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, University of Tasmania, Hobart, and there is a full-time Programme Coordinator. A proposal to XXV SCAR will suggest that some of these programmes should develop closer links with the relevant Working Groups of
SCAR REPORT TO XXII ATCM

SCAR because they also address much wider research fields than 
global change studies. The Group of Specialists will continue to 
serve as the System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) 
Regional Committee for the Antarctic.

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and 
Conservation (GOSEAC) met in Bremerhaven, Germany, during 
July 1996 and will meet in Basel, Switzerland, during September 
1998.  The work of GOSEAC is relevant to the Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Three new 
management plans for protected areas have been endorsed by SCAR 
and are due to be tabled at this meeting.

The ANTOSTRAT project has provided advice to the Ocean 
Drilling Program. This has resulted in a successful leg being 
undertaken in the Antarctic Peninsula region during the 1997-98 
season when nine holes were drilled. A second drilling season in 
the region of Prydz Bay is planned for the 1999-2000 season.

Some Working Groups have organized workshops on a variety of 
topics during the year with the general aims of reviewing progress 
and determining future lines of research. Further information is 
given in the body of this report.

SCAR is also maintaining a close interest in the developments 
relating to further research into Vostok Lake. Scientists from the 
US National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) are 
proposing to use the opportunity of Vostok Lake as a fore-runner to 
the planned mission to Europa, the frozen moon of Jupiter. The 
proposal to send a remote probe into the lake to relay data on the 
water, and possibly the underlying sediment, is a very exciting 
prospect. However, SCAR is very much aware of the potential 
environmental impact on any existing ecosystem that could result 
from entering the lake and will continue to urge caution and 
recommend that a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation is 
undertaken prior to the start of any invasive procedures.

The development of the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) at the 
International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research 
(ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand is progressing and some 600 
metadata records are now accessible. The SCAR-COMNAP Joint 
Committee on Antarctic Data Management (JCADM) continues to 
support Antarctic data management, the development of the AMD, 
and the effective links to National Antarctic Data Centres.

These are some of the highlights of SCAR's diverse activities. 
SCAR is planning to table four Information Papers (one jointly with 
COMNAP) at this meeting. In these and other ways SCAR wishes 
to maintain its key role as the scientific observer to the Antarctic 
Treaty System by continued input of independent scientific advice.

SCAR REPORT TO XXII ATCM
TROMSØ, NORWAY
25 MAY-5 JUNE 1998

Report under Recommendation XIII-2

1. INTRODUCTION

Since XXI ATCM in Christchurch, New Zealand, May 1997, the SCAR Executive Committee held a meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, during August 1997 in parallel with the annual meeting of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP X). During these meetings, the SCAR and COMNAP Executive Committees held a joint meeting. The next meeting of SCAR, XXV SCAR, will be held in Concepción, Chile, 20-31 July 1998. This year will mark the fortieth anniversary of the founding of SCAR at The Hague in February 1958.

The membership of SCAR is unchanged at 25 Full Members and 7 Associate Members (see Appendix 1). There have been no changes in the membership of the Executive Committee (Appendix 2) but the Chief Officers of two SCAR subsidiary groups (Appendix 3) have changed.

A list of papers to be presented to XXII ATCM is given at Appendix 4 and a list of SCAR publications is given at Appendix 5.

2. SCAR-COMNAP COOPERATION

SCAR and COMNAP continue to maintain routine contact through their Secretariats. A joint meeting of the SCAR and COMNAP Executive Committees was held in Capetown, South Africa, during August 1997. Among the issues discussed were more effective ways of reporting scientific developments to COMNAP, particularly the development of international science programmes, to provide improved advance notice of major logistic support requirements.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND CONSERVATION

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation held its ninth meeting (GOSEAC IX) in Bremerhaven, Germany, during July 1997, and will hold its tenth meeting (GOSEAC X) in Basel, Switzerland, during September 1998. Many topics were discussed, in particular management plans for three new protected areas. These plans have been accepted by SCAR National Committees and are listed below:

New Area:     Cape Royds, Ross Island
New Area:     Cape Adare
New Area:     Hut Point, Ross Island
                                                  3
SCAR REPORT TO XXII ATCM

4. Antarctic Data

The Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) is now established at the International 
Centre for Antarctic Information and Research (ICAIR) in Christchurch, New 
Zealand, and some 600 metadata records are included. The SCAR-COMNAP 
Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management (JCADM) is supporting 
Antarctic data management and the development of the AMD. A JCADM web 
site has been established and 'Guidelines for National Antarctic Data Centers' are 
available on the above web site. A separate report on data management has been 
prepared by JCADM and has been submitted as an Information Paper jointly by 
SCAR and COMNAP to this meeting.

5. The Antarctic and Global Change

The Group of Specialists on Global Change and the Antarctic (GLOCHANT) held 
its fifth annual meeting (GLOCHANT V) in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, during 
July 1997 and its sixth meeting (GLOCHANT VI) in Cambridge, United Kingdom 
during April 1998. The SCAR Global Change Programme Office, hosted by the 
Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean 
Environment at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, continues to 
provide support for the programme. Following GLOCHANT V there were 
seven individual programmes that operated under the umbrella of the Global 
Change Programme:
 
• Antarctic Ice Margin Evolution (ANTIME)
• Antarctic Sea-Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt)
• Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS)
• Ecology of the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (EASIZ)
• Ice Sheet Mass Balance and Sea-level (ISMASS)
• International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expeditions (ITASE)
• Palaeoenvironments from Ice Cores (PICE)

At GLOCHANT VI it was suggested that some of these programmes should 
develop closer links with the relevant SCAR Working Groups because they also 
address much wider research fields than global change studies. This would allow 
the overall global change programme to focus support and activity on those 
programmes that are making significant progress and are providing major 
datasets for global change research. The other programmes will continue to 
provide global change data although their primary thrust will be in other 
directions. These proposals will be presented to the SCAR Delegates at the XXV 
SCAR Meeting in July 1998. GLOCHANT will continue to provide a forum for 
the interaction of global change programmes in the Antarctic.

A separate Information Paper on global change research in the Antarctic will be 
submitted by SCAR to this meeting.

It is anticipated that these changes will require changes to the membership of the 
Group of Specialists but that the Group of Specialists will continue to form the 
START Regional Committee for the Antarctic.

SCAR REPORT TO XXII ATCM

A symposium on "Polar Aspects of Global Change", jointly sponsored by the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and SCAR, will be held in Tromsø, Norway, during September 1998. This will provide an opportunity for the two polar scientific communities to meet and discuss common problems. It will also draw attention to the major contrasts between the two polar regions.

6. Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Sciences

The First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere (FROST) project is nearing completion of the analysis of Antarctic weather forecasts and the monitoring of the Global Telecommunications System of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These activities have allowed improvements to be made to weather forecasting and data communications.

The depletion of Antarctic Stratospheric Ozone continues to be recorded each spring. During the last few years the level of depletion has continued to be very deep but, at present, there is no clearly discernible trend of either an increase or decrease in the level of depletion.

The Antarctic Geospace Observatory Network (AGONET) database, hosted by Italy, is continuing to support the collation and integration of data on magnetometry, riometry, Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves, and the horizontal vector velocity of the ionosphere. This international programme is now providing spatial and temporal information about geospace.

7. Earth Sciences and Glaciology

The first practical season of the Cape Roberts Drilling Project, to investigate the history of uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains and the climatic history of the last 100 million years, was unfortunately curtailed shortly after the start of drilling due to the deterioration of the sea ice at the drill site. However, 148 m of core were recovered and analysis of the core is now in progress. A workshop will be held in London, United Kingdom, during June 1998 to review the results.

The Working Group on Solid-Earth Geophysics held a workshop to review progress and plan future work for the magnetic anomaly map of Antarctica. This project will have important implications for geological research, particularly in correlating areas of exposure separated by ice sheet cover.

The ANTOSTRAT project is currently providing advice on site selection to the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP). A successful drilling leg (No 178) was undertaken in the Antarctic Peninsula area during the 1997-98 season when nine sites were drilled. Plans are well-advanced for a second Antarctic season in the Prydz Bay region provided that a suitable ice-picket ship can be obtained. The ANTOSTRAT group is continuing to maintain the Seismic Data Library System (SDLS).

The Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic Information has completed the first draft of a comprehensive gazetteer of Antarctic Place-names. This will be presented at XXV SCAR and further revisions incorporated into a final version. The work on revising the Antarctic Digital Database, the first seamless digital
5
SCAR REPORT TO XXII ATCM

topographic map of the Antarctic, is continuing. It is anticipated that the new 
version will be available on the World Wide Web for general research and 
educational purposes but that there will be restrictions on commercial use.

SCAR continues to maintain its interest in the research developments at Vostok 
Lake. Drilling for the extraction of ice cores has ceased at 3,200 m which is 
estimated to be about 100 m above the ice-water interface. More data are needed 
to characterize exactly the extent and internal structure of the lake, estimated to 
be at least 400,000 years old. US scientists from NASA are planning a programme 
to probe the lake waters remotely without introducing contaminants to the lake.

This programme will form a pilot scheme for the proposed investigation of the 
Europa moon of Jupiter where the ice surface of the moon may form a solid 
cover to a liquid ocean. SCAR will continue to urge caution and recommend 
that a full environmental impact assessment be undertaken. Nothing is known 
of any ecosystems that may be present and full precautions should be taken to 
guard against possible adverse effects.

8. LIFE SCIENCES

Three workshops in biological sciences were held:
  • on marine biological research in the Magellan region: to analyse, 
    summarize and compare results from three cruises in the region, and to 
    identify and develop future research directions.
  • on southern seabirds as marine predators: to undertake a statistical 
    analysis of population data to determine the status and population trends 
    of Antarctic and Subantarctic seabirds. SCAR is also continuing to support 
    the Central Data Bank for Antarctic Bird Banding at the University of Cape 
    Town in South Africa.
  • on the evolutionary biology of Antarctic organisms: an inaugural 
    workshop to determine the current status of research on evolutionary 
    biology and biodiversity, to identify new trends and techniques, and to 
    coordinate future research.

The Antarctic Pack Ice Seals (APIS) programme is planning a coordinated census 
of seals in all pack ice regions during the 1998-99 Antarctic field season. The 
census of seals will be performed from ships, with and without helicopter 
support, and by fixed-winged aircraft. In addition to the census, data on ice 
characteristics as well as the other biological components of the ecosystem will 
also be collected. Some of these data will used in the SCAR global change 
programme.

The 7th SCAR Symposium on Antarctic Biology will be held at Canterbury 
University, Christchurch, New Zealand, 1-5 September 1998. The theme for the 
symposium is "Antarctic ecosystems: models for wider understanding".
