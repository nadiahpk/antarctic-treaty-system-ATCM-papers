Background

The Antarctic Treaty System adopted official "Guidance For Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic" in 1994 as Recommendation XVIII-I. This guidance included reporting obligations, for both Advance Notification and Post Season Reporting.

Recognizing the value of a single standard form, the Parties adopted a trial form for collecting data on tourism activities as Resolution 3 in 1995. The trial form for Post Season Reporting was further refined and adopted by the Meeting in 1996.

At ATCM XXI in Christchurch the Meeting adopted the trial form with few modifications as Resolution 3 and asked that IAATO report to ATCM XXII.

IAATO has consulted with several Parties and non-governmental organizations on the value of the form and the data it generates. As stated in Resolution 3 (1997), the objective of the form is to "obtain consistent information that will facilitate the analysis of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourism and non-governmental activities."

Post-Visit Report, Part 1 (Expedition Record)

The Post Visit Report as adopted by ATCM XXI and used by Antarctic tour operators is attached to this report as attachment A. IAATO has no comments on Part 1, Expedition Record, which generates useful data in a consistent fashion about the organizer and expedition.

Post-Visit Report, Part 2 (Site Visit Record)

It is hoped that the information collected by the Post-Visit Report, Part 2 (Site Visit Record) provides data at a sufficient level of detail to enable a retrospective analysis of any potential impacts, particularly cumulative impacts.

The columns "Duration of Visit" and "Duration of Activities at Site Visited" did not generate useful information during the trial season in 1997-98, largely because the expedition leaders did not consistently interpret what was meant by these two categories. The distinction itself may not be useful especially if the most important information is the amount of time passengers spent ashore (assuming some correlation of time with potential impact).

IAATO proposes a minor modification of the data collected as shown in attachment B, with actual time of landing and departure recorded instead of asking for total duration. The actual time of landing and departure is easily collected and verifiable information. Such information would be collected by the expedition leader on site or, on ships, by the officer on watch, who maintains such records in the ship's log.

IAATO further proposes to produce a standard set of instructions which would be distributed with the form to tour operators.

IAATO strongly supports the use of this single form, which reduces the burden of paperwork and facilitates studies of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourist activities. As part of its ongoing work, IAATO is investigating the development of a database version of the form that will facilitate compilation and analysis of tour data.
POST-VISIT REPORT: PART 1 - Expedition Record

The Expedition Record is completed for every Expedition. This information is requested in compliance with
Antarctic Treaty Recommendation XVIII-1 and resolution XIX-3. Please submit to the appropriate national
authority within three months of the activity having taken place.
