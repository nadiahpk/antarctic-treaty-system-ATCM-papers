A Summary of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), 
Audits/reviews and Related Documents Prepared for Activities 
in Antarctica 
  
At ATCM XXI in Christchurch, New Zealand, Norway, as host country for ATCM 
XXII, offered to provide an updated list of environmental impact assessments, 
audits/reviews and associated guidance documents for that meeting (cf. paragraph 28 
of the final report from ATCM XXI). 
The following tables list and summarize information on Initial Environmental 
Evaluations (IEEs), Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs), 
Environmental reviews and audits and other EIA related documents prepared to cover 
activities in Antarctica. 
The information in the tables is based largely on papers prepared for previous 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings by the United Kingdom (XVIII ATCM/Info. 
9, XIX ATCM/Info. 15, XXATCM/Info.8) and New Zealand (XXI ATCM/Info. 57), 
as well as a subsequent update to December 1997 based on input from the Treaty 
Parties.
