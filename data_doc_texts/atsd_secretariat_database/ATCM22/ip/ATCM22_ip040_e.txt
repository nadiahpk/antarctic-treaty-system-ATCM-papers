Development of "State of the Environment" reports in the north - 
experiences with the EEA and AMAP processes 
  
A. Introduction and background 
The Antarctic Treaty Parties have initiated a process considering developing a "State 
of the Antarctic Environment Report". In the initial phase of this process it might be 
helpful to look at experiences from similar processes in other parts of the world.  
Norway has recently been involved in three processes aimed at describing aspects of 
the Arctic environment: i) the European Environmental Agency Report "State of the 
European Arctic Environment Report", ii) The State of the Arctic Environment 
Reports submitted at the First Arctic Ministerial Conference in Rovaniemi, Finland in 
1991, which constituted a basis for iii) the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy’s 
"Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program".  
 
This information document has been prepared by Norway to describe experiences 
from these Arctic processes, in order to illustrate potential level of cost and effort 
which might be expected for various types of "state of the environment reports".  
Parties are advised that the processes described in this paper are to a large degree not 
directly comparable (eg. are costs not calculated in the same manner). This paper 
attempts to give general information about several separate processes. 
  
B. Information about the development of the State of the European Arctic 
Environment Report (EEA-Report) 
1. Background 
The idea of developing a "State of the European Arctic Environment Report" (EEA 
Report) was introduced by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) in 1995. The 
EEA is organized under the European Union (EU) and has as mandate to orchestrate, 
cross-check and put to strategic use information of relevance to the protection and 
improvement of Europe’s environment.  
The Norwegian State Pollution Control Authority and the Norwegian Polar Institute 
picked up on the idea of developing a status report for the European Arctic 
Environment, and took the responsibility for further developing the idea. 
2. Aim 
The aim of the EEA Report was to: 
• 
give a breif overview of the Arctic ecosystems  
• 
give a brief overview of the environmental situation in the European Arctic  
• 
present the main environmental challenges for the region  
• 
recommend policy and management actions.  
It has also been a hope that the report will contribute to increased European awareness 
of the fact that:  
• 
the Arctic region is of great value globally and to all of Europe  
• 
it is also facing serious environmental threats  
• 
there is a strong need for a common European effort to manage the Arctic 
environment in a sustainable manner for the future.  
The report does not attempt to give a fully comprehensive picture of the region, its 
ecosystems, or its plant and animal species. It is produced over a brief time period, 
based on the information available. The references are restricted to the most basic 
literature. The background text is primarily intended to facilitate an understanding of 
the important and characteristic features of the European Arctic environment, and the 
impacts of human activity upon it.  
3. Content 
The EEA-Report describes in general terms the status of the European Arctic 
environment, pointing to pressures and threats to the Arctic environment and 
recommending policy and management actions. The report has the following table of 
contents: 
1. Geophysical characteristics  
2. Biota of the European Arctic  
3. Human Activities and Impacts  
4. The environmental status

4. Reporting format 
The State of the European Arctic Environment Report was produced in a traditional 
reporting format, ie. as a hard copy document. The report was published as an EEA 
Environmental Monograph (No.3). The document, which is 135 pages long, is richly 
illustrated. The summary of the report has later been made available on the world 
wide web and can be found at the following address: http://www.eea.dk/frdocu.htm. 
5. Process 
The development of "The State of the European Arctic Environment Report" followed 
a relatively simple procedural framework, summarized in the following points: 
i. 
Departure point: 
The European Environmental Agency (EU) put forward the wish that it would 
be useful to develop an assessment report for the European Arctic, an idea 
which the Norwegian State Pollution Control and the Norwegian Polar 
Institute then developed further. No further specific mandate was given. 
ii. 
Organization: 
The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) was tasked with the practical work, and a 
project group was established consisting of a project leader and project 
assistants from the Polar Environmental Management Department at the NPI. 
A reference group was also established, composed of scientific expertise, 
management expertise and representatives from the EEA. 
iii. 
Process: 
No strategy for the development of the plan existed in advance, and the 
process developed as the work went along. 
o 
Project group suggested Table of Contents (TOC)  
o 
Review and revision of geographic area to be covered in document 
done internally (Norwegian Polar Institute)  
o 
Endorsement of TOC (reference group)  
o 
Relevant information obtained from existing reports, national 
expertise, and in areas where national expertise lacked knowledge, 
international expertise (project group). No new environmental data wre 
gathered and assessed.  
o 
Drafting of text (project group)  
o 
Internal revisions, national revisions and revisions by reference group  
o 
Approval by reference group  
6. Time frame 
Work on the EEA Report was initiated in January 1995 and completed in February 
1996, i.e. 13 months all in all.  
7. Human resources 
At the NPI all together 4 people were involved in the process of developing the EEA 
Report, human resource use equaling approximately 1.1 man year: 
• 
1 project leader working part-time, (adding up to approx. 9 months full-time)  
• 
3 project assistants working all together 4 months  
In addition, many scientists and other experts devoted time in the process, either as 
part of the reference group or by contributing information to the report. 
8. Costs 
The total cost of producing the report (excluding wages, NPI office costs, etc.) was 
approximately US$ 95,000.  
  
C. Information about the development of the AMAP Assessment Report 
(AAR) and the State of the Arctic Environment Report (SOAER) 
1. Background 
In 1989 discussions regarding the state of the arctic environment were initiated in 
Rovaniemi, Finland. The reason for initiating these discussions was an increased 
awareness among the arctic nations of anthropogenic pollution in the Arctic, and 
concern over its possible effects.  
First stage - summary type report 
At the meeting in 1989 a process entailing the development of a summary type 
environmental status report was initiated. This "State of the Arctic Envrionment 
Report" was a summary of existing scientific data (extracted from scientific reports 
and national reports) with respect to the following issues: acidification, heavy metal 
contamination, underwater noise, oil pollution, organochlorines and radioactive 
pollutants. The following process was followed during the development of the 
summary report: 
• 
The report was compiled by a number of lead countries (coordinated by 
Finland) who took upon themselves to develop the individual chapters of the 
report.  
• 
A draft report was circulated to the contributing countries for comments and 
input.  
• 
Each country submitted their chapter text to the coordinating country who 
covered all the costs of editing and printing.  
• 
The report (405 pages) was submitted to the First Arctic Ministerial 
Conference in Rovaniemi in June 1991.  
Second stage - comprehensive report 
At the First Arctic Ministerial Conference (Rovaniemi, Finland, June 1991) the Arctic 
Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) was adopted by the governments of the 
eight circumpolar nations.  
One of the key aims of the AEPS is to examine the problem of pollution in the North. 
To achieve this, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) was 
established. The "State of the Arctic Environment Report" (described above) 
constituted an important basis for the work to be carried out through the AMAP-
process. 
AMAP was tasked with: 
• 
designing and implementing a coordinated monitoring programme, to monitor 
the levels of pollutants and assess the effects of pollution in all compartments 
of the Arctic environment, ie. atmospheric, terrestrial, freshwater and marine 
environment, as well as human populations with respect to human health.  
• 
instituting an assessment process and producing Assessment Reports.  
2. Aim 
The AMAP assessment process intended to accomplish the following: 
• 
Summarize and analyze the contemporary state of knowledge of the sources, 
levels, distributions, trends, fate and effects of contaminants and other 
anthropogenic influences on the environment and human health 
• 
Assess the relative magnitude of damage and threats to the environment and 
human health based on existing information 
• 
Recommend actions to reduce assessed damages and threats 
• 
Identify deficiencies and gaps in information and data required to improve the 
reliability of evaluations of such damage and threats that would warrant 
rectification through further scientific and social studies.  
The assessment process was based on data from already existing monitoring and 
research programs either within the Arctic, or in areas that affect the Arctic. However, 
also new programs were initiated to fill gaps in knowledge where necessary.  
Results from the monitoring and assessment process (1991-1997) are compiled in a 
status report to the Ministers. The information presented in the reports is based on: 
• 
data already published in scientific literature  
• 
data obtained from AMAP's monitoring programme (more than 400 projects)  
• 
traditional knowledge of the indigenous peoples.  
3. Content 
The AMAP reports assess the circumpolar area north of 60ºN in America and Asia 
and north of the arctic circle in Europe. The reports focus on the level of pollution in 
the various elements of the environment, and especially related to the following 
issues: 
• 
Persistent Organic Pollutants  
• 
Heavy Metals  
• 
Radioactivity  
• 
Acidification and Arctic haze  
• 
Petroleum hydrocarbons  
• 
Climate change  
• 
Pollution and human health  
4. Reporting format 
It has been the aim of the AMAP Assessment Process to present two final reports: 
• 
the AMAP Assessment Report (AAR) which is a comprehensive technical and 
scientifically presented assessment of all validated data available on the Arctic 
environment relative to the AMAP mandate (fully referenced document). The 
document is expected to be approximately 1000 pages. The AAR is expected 
to be finalized in May 1998. 
• 
The State of the Arctic Environment Report (SOAER) which is a report 
summarizing the results of the AMAP, intended for an educated general 
public, prefaced by an executive summary with recommendations specifically 
addressed to the Ministers of the eight Arctic countries. The document, which 
was presented to the Ministers in June 1997, is approximately 200 pages long. 
The document is also richly illustrated. Summaries of the main chapters of the 
SOAER report can be accessed on the world wide web at the following 
address: http://www.grida.no/amap. 
• 
The SOAER report has been translated to Danish, Greenlandic, Norwegian, 
Russian and Saami. 
5. Process 
The development of the AMAP Monitoring and Assessment Process was based on a 
detailed procedure which has been developed within the structure of AMAP.  
i. Departure point: 
• 
The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) was initiated under 
the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) Ministerial Conference 
in Rovaniemi 1991.  
ii. Organization: 
• 
In order to implement AMAP the eight Arctic countries established an Arctic 
Monitoring and Assessment Task Force (later renamed AMAP Working 
Group). Representatives from the indigenous people and from countries and 
international organizations involved in significant research and monitoring 
relevant to the Arctic are also acting as observers.  
• 
An AMAP Board (consisting of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the 
Executive Secretary) oversees the Working Group’s activities between 
sessions.  
• 
A permanent secretariat was also established, and has played a major role in 
coordinating the monitoring programs, in preparing the reports and in 
coordinating the exchange of scientific data between participating states.  
• 
An Assessment Steering Group (ASG) responsible for coordination of the 
work on the assessment reports was also established. The steering group has 
been composed of scientists/coordinators responsible for the preparation of 
individual chapters of the AMAP Assessment Reports. 
iii. Process: 
• 
At the first Governmental official meeting regarding pollution in the Arctic, 
held September 1989 in Rovaniemi, Norway and Russia was asked to prepare 
a report regarding monitoring of the Arctic.  
• 
Norway prepared a first draft of possible content for an international 
monitoring programme focusing on the Arctic, and gave an overview of 
ongoing research and monitoring activities within and in the vicinity of the 
Arctic area. 
• 
In December 1990 it was held a large international expert meeting in Oslo to 
discuss the Norwegian proposal. Based on the outcome of this meeting a draft 
monitoring and assessment programme was presented to the Ministerial 
meeting in Rovaniemi, June 1991. This document was the basis for the 
ministerial decision regarding future monitoring and assessment of the Arctic 
area and the establishment of AMAP.  
• 
Kick-off for development of strategy for assessment program at the first 
meeting in Task Force in December 1991. 
• 
The monitoring program was approved in 1993 including recommended 
methodology for quality assessment/quality control (QA/QC). 
• 
Prior to the fifth Working Group meeting in 1994 a meeting of experts was 
convened to further develop a strategy for the assessment and a structure and 
the content of the various chapters of the reports based on preliminary work 
and proposals by lead countries. 
• 
The strategy was developed, revised and adopted at the fifth Working Group 
meeting in 1994.  
• 
The secretariat coordinated the Assessment Process and the production of the 
reports.  
• 
Four thematic data centers were established for quality control and to compile 
environmental data (marine, atmospheric, freshwater and radioactive data 
centers) 
• 
A professional journalist was hired to write the SOAER in close cooperation 
with ASG and the secretariat. 
• 
Draft reports were reviewed by experts, contributors and steering group.  
• 
SOAR was approved by the Working Group in January 1997 and presented to 
the Arctic Ministers in June 1997 at the Alta meeting in Norway. 
• 
The AAR is to be released in May 1998. 
6. Time frame 
The whole process of developing the monitoring plan and the assessment reports, 
from its initiation at the first meeting in 1989 has taken 8 years, the SOAER having 
been presented to the public in June 1997, and the AAR expected to be presented in 
May 1998. 
7. Human resources 
The human resource use during the process of developing the assessment reports has 
been estimated to equal approximately 17.5 man years incurred over a period of ca. 4 
years: 
• 
10 man years for drafting of assessment by experts/coordinators (drafting 
contributions by others are not included)  
• 
1.5 man year for drafting of SOAER by journalist  
• 
3 man years for technical/secretarial support during drafting process  
• 
3 man years for technical support after submission of final drafts (file 
preparations, scientific and technical editing, linguistic editing, consistency 
checking, references, etc.)  
The secretariat has varied in size during the process, but consisted most of the time of 
an Executive Secretary, two deputy secretaries and one administrative assistant.  
In addition various people have spent time drafting text, as well as developing and 
carrying through monitoring programs, and analyzing monitoring results. 
8. Costs 
The Assessment Production costs have been estimated to be approximately US$ 
2,690,000 (incurred over a period of ca. 4 years), excluding wages for the experts who 
contributed data to the assessment: 
• 
1,050,000 US$ for operation of the Thematic Data Centers and additional data  
• 
handling support  
• 
370,000 US$ for contracted assessment contributions  
• 
100,000 US$ for drafting of SOAER by journalist  
• 
300,000 US$ for technical support during drafting process  
• 
210,000 US$ for technical support after submission of final draft  
• 
330,000 US$ for graphical production  
• 
50,000 US$ for preparation of materials for publication (lay-out etc.)  
• 
280,000 US$ for printing (AAR 4000 copies, SOAER 8000 copies)  
The monitoring and research activities which have contributed the data on which the 
Assessment is based have additionally been financed by the participating countries. 
Approximately 400 scientists have been involved in different parts of this work.
