GUIDELINES FOR THE REPORTING OF OIL SPILL INCIDENTS
WHICH OCCUR IN ANTARCTICA

Antarctic Programs

PREFACE

This document outlines the procedure to be used by national Antarctic operators for reporting to the COMNAP Secretariat oil spill incidents which occur in Antarctica.

The document was prepared under the direction of the Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations (SCALOP) by the SCALOP Sub-group on Oil Spill Prevention and Response. The Sub-group was established by SCALOP in June 1990 with representatives from Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States of America.

The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) approved the reporting procedure at its meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand during June 1993.

GUIDELINES FOR THE REPORTING OF OIL SPILL INCIDENTS
WHICH OCCUR IN ANTARCTIC

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 The intention of this procedure is to provide an archival record of oil spill incidents
which occur in the Antarctic Treaty area in order to assist national operators to determine
whether there is a need to modify or improve oil handling practices.

2. OIL SPILL REPORTING PROCEDURE

2.1 In the event of an oil spill incident in excess of 200 litres (and for oil spills less than 200
litres, if considered significant) national Antarctic operators are to lodge a COMNAP Oil
Spill Report with the COMNAP Secretariat.

2.2 The report is to be provided in English and lodged with the COMNAP Secretariat within
30 days of the incident occurring.

2.3 In the event of a major spill, a copy of the press release or publicly released statement on
the incident should be provided to COMNAP members through the COMNAP
Secretariat.

3. REPORTING FORMAT

3.1 The format and content of the COMNAP Oil Spill Report, which is to be lodged with the
COMNAP Secretariat, is given in Annex A. A description of the information to be
provided in the report is described against each heading.

4. OIL SPILL SITREP

4.1 To facilitate the collection of information in a format which will assist in the compilation
of the COMNAP Oil Spill Report, a suggested Situation Report (SITREP) format is given
in Annex B. It should be noted that the SITREP is intended for the internal use of
national operators only, and is not to be lodged with the COMNAP Secretariat.
