IAATO EDUCATION AND TRAINING  PAGE 1 
 
 
 
IAATO here presents its report to the Meeting on member company programs for training and 
education as offered at ATCCM XXI (Final report, Item 13, para.133).  
 
The report consists of two parts: an excerpt on the subject from a 1997 environmental assessment; 
and the results of a survey developed by COMNAP and distributed by IAATO.   
 
The training and education of staff by current members of IAATO is remarkably similar, depending 
heavily on written materials, lectures and tutoring by experienced staff. IAATO has developed a 
standard table of contents for expedition leader handbooks and manuals as well as an educational 
slide show on Recommendation XVIII-I that is used by all member companies. Regular exchange 
of information on programs takes place at the annual meeting and informally throughout the season. 
IAATO EDUCATION AND TRAINING  PAGE 2 
 
 
This information on education and training is excerpted and adapted from: 
 
INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION, Ship Based Tourism by Five U.S. Organizers 
to the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands, November 
1997- March 1998. Submitted to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, October 14, 
1997 
 
 
5.1.4 Education, training and experience of staff 
 
While each individual tour operator conducts its own training programs and hires according to its 
own standards, IAATO collects systematic information on the qualifications and experience of the 
field staff employed by its members. IAATO standards require that its members hire staff that, as a 
whole, has at least 75% previous Antarctic experience. The 175 staff members employed during the 
1996-97 Antarctic season by IAATO members had, on average, seven years of Antarctic experience 
(ranging from 1-35). Field staff are hired according to a number of criteria, including their Antarctic 
field experience with Treaty Party research programs.  
 
Each Expedition Leader is supplied with a handbook/manual, which includes details of safe and 
efficient standard procedures for an environmentally sound cruise program.  Experience and 
training of small-boat (e.g. Zodiac) operators is a primary concern of all tour operators, with many 
employing formal training courses for their drivers that are certified by U.S. Coast Guard or 
equivalent in non-U.S. countries. The ship safety officer and Expedition Leader are ultimately 
responsible for screening and approving Zodiac drivers. 
 
Officers, staff, crew and passengers on a tour vessel in Antarctica are given specific, formal 
information on the obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System. Periodic mandatory conservation 
briefings are held for crew members in their own languages. All staff and crew receive a copy of 
Recommendation XVIII-1, Guidance For Antarctic Visitors, and Guidance For Those Organising 
and Conducting Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic in one of six languages. 
 
In addition, many IAATO members conduct workshops, training courses or other company-specific 
training for Antarctic staff and company representatives attend an annual meeting of IAATO. 
 
 
 
5.1.5 Education of Passengers 
 
Although not a requirement of the Antarctic Treaty System, tour operators assume an obligation to 
educate passengers with regard to the uniqueness of Antarctica, the sensitivity of wildlife in the 
ecosystem, and the need for conducting an environmentally sound visit to the continent. This not 
only is a sensible and standard business practice because it often results in repeat clientele, but it 
also creates passengers who have a meaningful concern for the Antarctic environment, thus 
becoming 'Ambassadors' who transfer those impressions to others. This is not only an important 
component of the purpose and value of Antarctic tourism, this emphasis on education also helps to 
minimize any potential environmental impact. 
 
Providing a first-hand Antarctic experience to tourists educates them to the ecological sensitivity of 
IAATO EDUCATION AND TRAINING  PAGE 3 
 
 
the Antarctic environment and promotes a greater understanding of the earth's resources and the 
important role of Antarctica in the global environment. It can also build substantial political support 
for continued scientific research in the Antarctic. Controlled visitation by well informed, well 
prepared travelers in small groups, led by experts in the field, helps ensure ecologically sustainable 
activities and the continued protection of Antarctica. 
 
Prior to embarking on a voyage, passengers receive a package of predeparture materials, including 
information on safety and conservation, an extensive Antarctica Primer, and a copy of 
Recommendation XVIII-1, “Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic.” Passengers also receive a copy 
of the National Science Foundation pamphlet, “Conservation of Antarctic Seabirds,” that educates, 
in user friendly language and format, the reader on the Antarctic Conservation Act by describing 
the area's birds and their habitat, conservation tips and other related information. Passengers also 
receive an extensive reading list, which includes the “Oceanites Site Guide to the Antarctic 
Peninsula.” Copies of predeparture materials are available from individual tour operators.  
 
Once on board, briefings and education continue. “Behold Antarctica,” a video produced by the 
U.S. NSF Office of Polar Programs that highlights obligations of the U.S. Antarctic Conservation 
Act, is shown onboard voyages with U.S. citizens. All passengers receive a copy of 
Recommendation XVIII-1, in one of six languages, as an integral part of conservation briefings 
aboard ship. An initial hour-long mandatory briefing on Antarctic conservation and etiquette ashore 
is held before the first landing. This briefing features an IAATO-produced slide presentation 
reinforcing Recommendation XVIII-1. 
 
Emphasis is placed on significant sensitive features of shore visits, particularly any Antarctic 
protected areas that may be within the vicinity of the area visited.  Protected areas receive special 
attention in briefings of passengers, staff, bridge officers and pilots for purposes of shore stops, 
zodiac cruises and helicopter activities.  
 
Regular briefings are held onboard regarding planned activities by the expedition leader, 
supplemented by a printed daily events sheet and announcements over the public address system. 
Onboard lecturers provide regular slide-illustrated presentations on topics of interest, including 
lectures with an emphasis on sound environmental practices around wildlife in the Antarctic. In 
addition to the lecture program, documentary videos are shown as part of the onboard lecture 
program. These are often supplemented by the very useful presentations given by station personnel 
who board tour vessels when scheduled visits are made to the U.S. stations Palmer and McMurdo, 
for example. Each vessel also carries a small polar library, including documents of the Antarctic 
Treaty System.  
 
Lecturers and other staff supervise, monitor and guide walks ashore or during small boat 
excursions. According to IAATO standards, the ratio of staff to passengers ashore will be a 
minimum of 1:15-20. This number is often exceeded in practice.

HOW DO YOU THINK EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR PEOPLE WORKING IN, OR VISITING 
ANTARCTICA, COULD BE IMPROVED? 
      
 
 
Abercrombie & Kent 
We believe the education and training for people visiting Antarctica, (ie tourists) is 
already quite comprehensive and handled appropriately. I would however like to 
see some standardization between the operators conducting ship-bourne tourism. 
Common standards could be determined within IAATO to create standardized 
operating manuals, i.e. zodiac  drivers manual, expedition leader’s handbook, 
visitor briefings, etc. and staff could participate in training programs.  All of this is 
of course, contingent upon additional funds being allocated to this issue.
