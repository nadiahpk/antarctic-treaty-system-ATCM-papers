PERSPECTIVE PLANS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGES OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE RUSSIAN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION IN 
1998-2001 

The changes in the economical and political situation in Russia taking place for the last 7 years have governed the need for developing the Russian Antarctic program. Its scientific aims and goals are presented in the Federal Task Program "World Ocean" and the required changes in the logistics infrastructure are contained in a special Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation issued on August 28, 1997.

At the present time in Antarctica, Russia maintains 5 permanent stations: Molodezhnaya, Mirny, Vostok, Novolazarevskaya and Bellinsghausen and 4 seasonal bases (Progress, Druzh­naya-4, Soyuz and Oasis). The infrastructure of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) was created in the 1970s-1980s and is oriented to establishing and maintaining large year-round stations. For this purpose, power-consuming technical means were used, as a rule, since at that time fuel in the Russian market had a purely symbolic price. Serious financial problems in the current budget sphere of the Russian Federation occurring in our State as a result of perestroyka and reforms could not but be reflected in the work of the RAE. Two stations were closed in the Pacific sector of Antarctica (March 1990 - Russkaya and March 1991 - Leningradskaya). The planned scopes of seasonal studies were constantly reduced with the start of Antarctic navigation postponed to later dates. This has lead to Vostok station being temporarilly closed down twice in 1994 and 1996. Critical situation regarding the supply of the Russian Antarctic stations with fuel and food was created repeatedly. Thus the needed financial support for the existing RAE infrastructure under the changed economic conditions determined by the necessary tendencies for reduced costs and forced delays in financial allocations has become impossible and required revision,

In the mid-1990s, the RAE had three separate functionally oriented expedition work centers. The Antarctic meteorological center Molodezhnaya was a center for acquisition, primary processing and transfer of all operational information of Russian studies in the Antarctic. The Mirny Observatory traditionally remained the main repair-preparation base for inland transport operations using heavy caterpillar vehicles. Finally, the Progress station and the seasonal field base Druzh­naya-4 located at the coast of Prydz Bay served as the supporting points of seasonal geological and geophysical studies. Such multipurpose structure could be efficiently and operationally managed only provided the RAE had several expedition vessels at its disposal. Each of the indicated Antarctic stations needed its specific seasonal period of logistical operations thus coming into conflict with only one supply vessel available. As a result, planning of seasonal work required prioritization which was supplemented by the problems of sharply restricted resupply during the previous expedition.

Thus, the existing expedition-logistical potential of the RAE required reorganization both in terms of organization and from the economical standpoint. In doing so, the known problems of formation of the Federal budget of Russia required real minimization of financial costs of the next RAE.

A new structural concept of the expedition potential of the RAE should be 
considered as a formal decrease of the Russian presence in the Antarctic. The 
transfer of the RAE activities to the regime of minimum permissible parameters 
aims to make more specific and stabilize the activity of Russia in the Antarctic. 
The undertaken RAE reorganization reflects the natural course of the process of 
Antarctic exploration. The majority of the Antarctic Treaty member countries has 
either finished it or started implementing similar actions. The Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty ratified by the Russian 
Federation in May 1997 has served as a serious impetus for initiating this work.

Main aims of the reorganization program:
1.      Reconstruction of the existing RAE infrastructure in accordance 
with the current economical conditions and nature protection 
requirements;
2.      Maintaining at an adequate level the priority national and 
international scientific programs of environmental studies, which 
include:
-       current state of Antarctic environment and the forecast of its 
changes in the future in connection with global changes 
(comprehensive monitoring of the Antarctic environment);
-       paleoreconstruction of the Antarctic environment based on 
studies of ice cores from deep and subsurface drilling of the Antarctic 
Ice Sheet, bottom sediments of surface and subglacial Antarctic lakes 
and comprehensive geological-geophysical studies of the Antarctic 
land and the underwater continental margin;
-       interaction of glaciers of the marginal zone of Antarctica with 
ocean water in connection with the increase of the World Ocean.
3.      Implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty;
4.      Organization of one RAE logistics center in Antarctica at the base 
of Progress station.

Practical direction of reorganization of the RAE:
-       by-stage temporary closing down of Molodezhnaya station 
(1998-1999) with a full clearing of the station territory; in the end 
only a small temporarily closed down seasonal base will be left 
instead of this station.
-       Reorganization and minimization of Bellingshausen station 
including a complex of necessary nature protection measures;
-       Transfer of the transportation terminal for inland traverses 
from Mirny station to Progress station;
-       Construction of the airfield for receiving heavy aircraft in the 
region of Progress station;
-       Decrease of Mirny station which will remain in the future as 
a base station for background environmental monitoring;
-       Decrease in the number of vessels used for supporting the 
activities of the Russian Antarctic stations up to 2 vessels.

Beginning from the season of the 43d RAE (1997-1998) the implementation of this program began:

In the seasonal RAE activities only two vessels participate: the research expedition vessel "Akademik Fedorov" and the R/V "Akademik Karpinsky".

All program observations at Molodezhnaya station have been fully completed and dismantling of equipment, buildings and structures of this largest RAE station has started. The 1998 wintering will become the last one for this station after which the work for liquidating the station will be conducted during the season.

The activity for replacing the seasonal Progress station by the wintering station is underway. The location for construction of the snow-ice runway for wheel aircraft of the IL-76 MD type has been finally selected.

                                                                                                                                3
