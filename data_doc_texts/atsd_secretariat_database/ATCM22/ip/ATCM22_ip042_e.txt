Progress report to ATCM on marine debris pollution: A matter of present concern and suggestions for future actions to attempt to minimize the problem

Daniel Torres N.1

Introduction

Agenda Item 12 (Science Issues) of the XXI ATCM (Cristchurch, N.Z. 19 - 30 May, 1997), paragraph 119, states: "Chile tabled Working Paper (XXI ATCM/WP 12 Rev.1) calling for the establishment of a programme to assess and prevent damage to wildlife and the environment being caused by marine debris, particularly plastic, being discarded from ships into the seas around Antarctica. The Meeting welcomed the paper and noted that paragraphs 33 and 34 of the Statement by the CCAMLR Observer (XXI ATCM/INF 77) indicated that there has been an increase in the amount of marine debris in the Southern Ocean and that the CCAMLR Secretariat had been asked to prepare materials for an education initiative to reverse this trend. The Meeting noted the seriousness of this issue and requested that CCAMLR, IAATO and other interested Parties report on progress in assessing and dealing with the marine debris problem at ATCM XXII."

Pursuant to the wishes of the Meeting, the purpose of this document is to provide a summary of the results from monitoring activities carried out by Chile in the SSSI Nº32 "Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Islets", Livingston Island, and suggest some future actions as an attempt to minimize the problem.

Results

As it is shown in the Fig. 1, during the Antarctic Seasons 1993/94, 1994/97, 1995/96 and 1996/97, more than 700 kg of marine debris were collected from the beaches of Cape Shirreff. The number of articles increased from 1993/94 to 1995/96, mainly due to the presence of great drum oils in the area, and then replaced by plastic garbage, as it is seen in the curve of weigh which is declining.

Fig. 2 shows, in comparison, the composition of marine debris during all these Antarctic seasons of monitoring marine debris. In all seasons, plastic is the main item being more than 90%. In the latest season a total of 1,609 articles were collected with a total weight of 49 kg. In this occasion there were 18.6 kg less than the previous one. This is because the plastic item was the most abundant, especially 708 articles of expanded polystyrene (EP), which is evidently lighter with respect to other synthetic material such as pieces of rope, plastic containers, and net pieces.

Plastic was composed by 1,517 pieces (94.3%), while the glass articles were 67 (4.2%), the metal pieces were 19 (1.2%), and 6 paper pieces (0.4%).

These results mean that plastic (n = 1,517) continues as one of the most important items among all marine debris, and in this case it is represented by 708 pieces (46.7%) of EP, especially used in logistic and tourist ships; 421 elements (27.8%) used mainly in fisheries, such as strapping bands, ropes, and net pieces; and 308 pieces (20.3%) among which several kinds of plastic bottles, plastic cans, and several others articles of domestic use are included.

Even though the EP pieces have diminished comparing the obtained figures with the previous season (N = 1,3151), they have now become the principal article among all synthetic material. On one side, this fact explains the low total weight of marine debris collected (see Fig. 1), and on the other side it may suggest the origin of the EP, probably comes from tourist groups and logistic activities in the Antarctic Trety Area (ATA). Another hypothesis is that the EP pieces, due to their buoyancy, could come from outside the ATA, carried by ocean currents and during stormy and windy days. Some of the EP articles indicate a long permanence in the water due to green algae growing on them, and others are clearly of recent origin. If some of these articles have appeared in the ATA, this means that a transgression to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection, Article 7 "Forbiden Products", Annex III, may have occurred.

As it happened during the surveys carried out during the seasons 1994/95, and 1995/96, some plastic debris collected (n = 15) show evidences of having been processed into incinerators before being thrown into the water. Even though we have had this time a low record compared to 51 pieces collected in the previous season; it is posssible to infer that the ashes produced out of this process have been also disposed into the sea (Torres and Jorquera, 1996).
Impact on birds and fur seals

During the Antarctic season 1996/97, as it occurred in the previous one, marine debris were collected from some nests of kelp gulls, Larus dominicanus, and sheathbill, Chionis alba. Besides, two females of antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, were seen with neck collars. As it was established in 1994/95 by scientists at field, all plastic material was removed from the nests and from the neck of fur seals. 'All these findings have become "traditional" in the area, and reflect the continuing problem (Torres et al , 1997). About the entanglement problem, Hucke-Gaete et al (1997) give a detailed information from 1987/88 to 1996/97. A total of 20 entangled animals has been recorded, from which 35% have been released in the past three Antarctic seasons: four females, one juvenil male, and two pups three months old. Even though this means a low rate of entanglement, fluctuating around 0.026 (± 0.011 S.D.) compared to those for Bird Island, informed by Arnould and Croxall (1995) with a 0.3 in 1989/90, and 0.07 for 1995/96 Antarctic season, this means that it is a persistent problem which sometimes causes severe wounds to animals, and it may possibly cause death. The figures on the entanglement given here, with certainty it is an underestimation of the problem. How many animals become entangled each season around the Antarctic islands in the Southern Ocean? Surely, it is impossible to give precise figures. Nevertheless, the reports given during this kind of meeting, as well as in other meetings of other international organizations, such as CCAMLR, may contribute to give steps and take actions against the marine pollution with marine debris, with the purpose to reduce the problem, whose principal item, plastic, is the most important with deletereous effects on the marine biota.

Conclusions

1. Marine debris pollution in the Southern Ocean continues to increase as a real fact, over which the international community has an especial concern, but it is necessary to take and promote new actions, in order to cope with this challenge.

2. Due to this, it is important to continue to provide this kind of reports, in order to periodically update monitorig information.
3. An important matter related to the protection and the conservation of the sea 
and its biota, to be kept in mind by shipbuilders and naval engineers, would 
entail including in the working drawing a specific and adequate hold into ships 
where the classified garbage produced on board could be stored, with its 
respective compartments marked with the international colour for plastic, glass, 
cans, paper, and other kinds of clean or solid debris, with the purpose of being 
disembarked in all international ports endowed with appropriate facilities to 
receive and manage this kind of waste.

4. Meanwhile, it is suggested that companies and owners of Antarctic fleets and 
ships make an effort to accomodate on board an specific container to store the 
garbage produced in order to disembark it adequately in ports located outside 
the Convention area. The amount of garbage produced and disembarked would 
be a matter to be included in the respective logbooks.

5. The suggestion is in line with Annex IV of the Protocol and could be 
considered within the context of the discussion of the proposed Polar Code of 
the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
