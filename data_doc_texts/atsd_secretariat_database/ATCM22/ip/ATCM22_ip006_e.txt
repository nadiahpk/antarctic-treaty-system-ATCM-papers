Information Paper on
EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANNING

BACKGROUND

1.    Working Paper (WP9) presented by the UK to the ATCM XXI in Christchurch noted, following a survey of national Antarctic operators conducted in 1996, that:
      - approximately 40% of Antarctic research stations had no oil spill contingency plans;
      - some plans remained only in draft;
      - plans were highly variable in quality; and
      - plans conformed only partially, or barely at all, to the COMNAP Guidelines.

The situation with vessels was more favourable with over 80% of vessels (both governmental and NGO) carrying shipboard oil pollution emergency plans.

2.    In consideration of these facts, ATCM XXI, Resolution 1 recommended:

      "1.  That those Consultative Parties whose research stations and vessels operating in Antarctica are not covered by contingency plans should take the necessary steps to ensure that the operators of the stations and vessels introduce plans based on the 1992 Guidelines prepared by COMNAP.

      2.    That the Consultative Parties, individually or collectively, should to the extent possible carry out regular contingency exercises, both theoretical and practical on land and at sea, to test and thereby refine their contingency plans, and report on the results of the exercises to the ATCM. Exercises at sea should be carried out in accordance with the relevant maritime conventions.

      3.    In view of the relevance of work being done by IMO, that the IMO expert invited to attend ATCM XXII be requested to take part also in the discussions on this subject.

      4.    That COMNAP and IAATO submit Information Papers to ATCM XXII describing their respective Guidelines for Contingency Plans, the extent to which the plans have been put in place, and plans for future work."

GUIDELINES FOR CONTINGENCY PLANS

3.    In 1990 COMNAP requested its Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations (SCALOP) to develop guidelines for oil spill prevention and response in the Antarctic. As a result of this work COMNAP published the following documents in June 1992, copies of which were distributed to all national Antarctic operators:
      - Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning (outlining in detail the format and content of facility and multi-operator contingency plans);
2

- Recommended Procedures for Fuel oil Transfer at Stations (providing guidelines 
on documentation, operator training, transfer operations, equipment inspection 
and maintenance); and

- Recommendations for Spill Prevention and Containment of Fuel Oil at Stations 
and Bases (providing guidelines on spillage prevention, containment, detection, 
alert and recovery).

These documents were presented to the Venice ATCM and appear in the Final Report of the 
Seventeenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting as Annexes 3, 4 and 5. In addition 
COMNAP developed and promulgated Guidelines for the Reporting of Oil Spill Incidents in 
November 1993.

4.    The Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning were developed following an 
intensive review of industry and government practice in a number of countries and the 
recommended contingency planning guidelines published by the IMO  and other 
organisations. In addition, the IMO and several national maritime authorities were consulted 
regarding the proposed COMNAP guidelines. When the guidelines were published in 1992, 
COMNAP considered them to reflect best industry practice for the development of oil spill 
contingency plans.

SURVEY RESULTS

5.    Attached is a summary of the survey results detailing responses from twenty 
COMNAP national agencies. Nine countries did not offer responses.

6.    From the responses provided, the data indicates that:

- Contingency plans have been developed for the vast majority of year-round 
stations;

- In general, plans have not been developed for some small summer bases and field 
camps;

- Most vessels have ship-board oil spill pollution emergency plans;

- Virtually all the national operators advise that they have followed the COMNAP 
Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning;

- Around 70% of national operators conduct theoretical training on oil spill 
response and 65% undertake practical exercises on spill response;

- Nine national operators have contingency/emergency plans for incidents other 
than oil spills (e.g. search and rescue, fire and accidents); and

- Virtual all national operators assess the most common risks to life and property 
that can arise in the usual course of Antarctic program activities.

PLANS FOR FUTURE WORK

7.    In response to the ATCM XXI, COMNAP established an Emergency Response and 
Contingency Planning Working Group at its 1997 meeting in Cape Town. The Working 
Group has been tasked to:

      -  Review the 1992 COMNAP Guidelines for Oil Spill Contingency Planning and 
         the extent to which, and the consistency of, contingency plans that have been 
         prepared for all national program facilities in Antarctica. Review the status of oil 
         spill contingency plans for national programs’ ships operating in the Antarctic.

      -  Review the SCALOP Guidelines with a view to their expansion to include, in 
         addition to oil spills, other incidents with potential adverse environmental 
         impacts.

      -  Revisit the matter of regional contingency planning through the work of three 
         sub-groups; one for the Ross Sea area, chaired by the member from Italy with 
         members also from NZ and USA; one for the Peninsula area chaired by the 
         member from Chile with members also from Argentina and the UK; and another 
         for the Prydz Bay area chaired by the member from Australia with members also 
         from China and Russia.
