Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Tromso, May 1998

Report from the International Hydrographic Organisation

Presented by Norway, representing the IHO

Introduction.

At the ATCM in Seoul in 1995, the Treaty nations passed a resolution [1/1995] concerning the importance of improving the charting of Antarctic waters, in the interests of the safety of navigation, and to prevent the environmental pollution which might result from a shipwreck.

The International Hydrographic Organisation presents a short report on the progress of these endeavours since ATCM XXI in Christchurch in 1997.

Progress of Surveys and Charting.

The execution of Hydrographic Surveys in temperate climates is a very time consuming process, given the requirement to identify without fail all dangers to navigation.  This is because the sonar based technology used for the task requires laborious work in obtaining closely spaced sounding profiles from a boat or ship.  The technology of space based mapping techniques cannot, as yet, satisfy the requirements of safe marine navigation.  The rate of progress of surveys in high latitudes is very slow indeed, given the technological constraints mentioned above, and the very limited seasonal opportunities to carry out the work.

Nevertheless steady progress has been reported in the season 1997/98, and five IHO member States mounted hydrographic surveying expeditions in that season.  The five nations reporting activities were Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, and United Kingdom.. New Zealand has undertaken some training as a preliminary to future campaigns.

Chart production based on these surveys is progressing, nine new charts being scheduled for publication in 1998, and a further 17 planned for publication by the end of the year 2000.

A new edition of the IHO publication S 59, Status of Hydrographic Surveying and Nautical Charting in Antarctica, has been published, and is available from national hydrographic offices on request.  A copy will be tabled at ATCM XII.

In recognition of the importance of the Antarctic hydrographic programmes the International Hydrographic Organisation, at its XV Conference in 1997, established a permanent Regional Committee for Antarctica to replace the previous working group.

Issues of Interest.

Links with IAATO

In the period 1993 to 1997 the main concern of the IHO Permanent Working Group for Cooperation in Antarctica was the establishment of an internationally approved chart scheme for Antarctic waters, and the encouragement of a greater rate of effort in hydrographic surveying on the Antarctic Coast.
By the end of 1996 much had been achieved, as reported by the IHO representative to the XXI ATCM.

During this period considerable effort was devoted to informing the operators of government vessels of the poor state of surveying and charting, and of consequent risks of navigational accidents.  Statistics were obtained to establish vessel traffic patterns, in order to focus more effectively the efforts of national hydrographic offices.
In 1997 and 1998 some effort has been devoted to establishing contact with the operators of non-government 
vessels, especially tourist operators, through links with IAATO. These links have now been established, and 
need to be developed during the next few years for the benefit of the entire Antarctic community.

Links with COMNAP

It is also clear that closer links should be established between IHO and COMNAP. Both Organisations believe 
that this is necessary, and efforts will be made to ensure that that is achieved.

Reporting Form [Agenda Item 12]

IHO Member Hydrographic Offices are most supportive of the initiatives regarding a reporting form for 
activities within Antarctica. This will provide a valuable data base for prioritising the surveying and charting 
activities to meet the needs of users. It will also provide assistance to hydrographic offices wishing to identify 
ships of opportunity which might be used to progress surveys in locations which are not close to the main 
Antarctic bases.

Polar Navigation Code [Agenda Item 10]

The IHO and its Member States are most supportive of the new Polar Navigation Code. The draft code refers, 
in its second paragraph, to the 'relative lack of good charts'. IHO intends to ask IMO to give this problem 
greater emphasis, and to include it as a matter to be addressed in the detail of training and certification 
requirements for navigators. It appears that the problem is not sufficiently recognised by mariners at present, as 
evidenced by the significant number of groundings of supply and tourist vessels in high latitudes [both Antarctic 
and Arctic] in recent years.

Antarctic Spatial Data Infrastructure

The IHO is in contact with the Project Officer for the SCAR project for an Antarctic Spatial Data Infrastructure. 
The hydrographic offices of IHO Member States are committed to optimising the availability and use of the 
bathymetric data sets in their custody in the service of Antarctic science and operations, and are fully supportive 
of this project.

Conclusion

Continued Support for National Hydrographic Programmes in Antarctica

The IHO requests ATCM members to continue to express their support for the Antarctic programmes of national 
hydrographic offices.
