Based on energy analysis in the Machu Picchu Station, it has been concluded that the form of 
energy required for an specific use (electricity or heat) can determine the source that could be 
used in order to achieve a high, global, energetic and environmental efficiency.

In that way, it has been evaluated two energy sources, eolic and solar, for specific purposes.

Eolic energy must be preceded by an study of its potential according to available information 
and/or to reading data. Provided there is not a continuous data register for an annual period in 
Crepin Point, it has been determined the correlation of wind features between Ferraz Station of 
Brasil and Machu Picchu Station of Peru, during the 96-97 summer, by means of simultaneous 
measures.

During the study period it has been obtained an average speed of 6,24 m/s with predominant NW 
wind direction, and a maximum speed of 54,3 m/s. Using these data it has been calculated that 
the density of eolic energy is about 33,46 kW/m^(2) , with a 67,78% of the time having a speed 
greater than 3,5 m/s.

Thus, using a 10 kW nominal power aerogenerator, we could obtain 12087,25kW-h for a 20 days 
period, and with five of these aerogenerators, we could satisfy the station requirements.

In accord with the analysis of solar radiation values obtained in Machu Picchu Station (62^(o) S), it 
has been concluded that in the Sub-Antarctic zone, the solar energy potential is acceptable for 
heating as soon as for electricity generation.

Obtaining electric energy from low power photo-voltaic panels to charge batteries is a reality now, 
and systems like these are increasing in the Antarctic; however, there is no experience driving 
electric motors or heating fluids. Tests, with these two solar systems, have been done in the 
Peruvian Scientific Antarctic Expedition 97-98.
The first system tested consists of an electric pump, 24 volts, 4 GPM nominal capacity, that is connected to two photo-voltaic panels 48W power each. The flow obtained is 1,7 GPM with an average solar radiation of 400 W/m2 . It means that a ¼ HP pump can supply water for 20 people during summer.

The second system tested consists of an evacuated tube solar water heater, 80 liters storage capacity. It has been obtained a 72% efficiency, increasing water temperature in 23°C, with an average solar radiation of 460 W/m2 . Thus, the heater can supply water having acceptable levels for its use.

Studies done on eolic and solar energy, will be the basis for designing electricity generation and supply and heating water systems in the Station.
