INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION
ON OIL POLLUTION PREPAREDNESS,
RESPONSE AND CO-OPERATION, 1990

THE PARTIES TO THE PRESENT CONVENTION,

CONSCIOUS of the need to preserve the human environment in
general and the marine environment in particular,

RECOGNIZING the serious threats posed to the marine environment
by oil pollution incidents involving ships, offshore units, sea ports and
oil handling facilities,

MINDFUL of the importance of precautionary measures and
prevention in avoiding oil pollution in the first instance, and the need for
strict application of existing international instruments dealing with
maritime safety and marine pollution prevention, particularly the
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended,
and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,
1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, as amended,
and also the speedy development of enhanced standards for the design,
operation and maintenance of ships carrying oil, and of offshore units,

MINDFUL ALSO that, in the event of an oil pollution incident, prompt
and effective action is essential in order to minimize the damage which
may result from such an incident,

EMPHASIZING the importance of effective preparation for combating
oil pollution incidents and the important role which the oil and shipping
industries have in this regard,

RECOGNIZING FURTHER the importance of mutual assistance and
international co-operation relating to matters including the exchange of
information respecting the capabilities of States to respond to oil pollution
incidents, the preparation of contingency plans, the exchange
of reports of significance e  which may affect the marine
environment or the coastline and related interests of States, and research
and development respecting means of combating oil pollution in the marine
environment,

TAKING ACCOUNT of the " polluter pays " principle as a general
principle of international environmental law,
ARTICLE 2
Definitions:
For the purposes of this Convention:
(1)    Oil means petroleum in any form including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge,
       oil refuse and refined products.
(2)    Oil pollution incident means an occurrence or series of occurrences
       having the same origin, which results in a discharge of oil
       and which poses a threat to the marine environment, or to
       the coastline or related interests of one or more States, and which requires
       emergency action or other immediate response.
(3)    Ship means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine
       environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles,
       submersibles, and floating craft of any type.
(4)    Offshore unit means any fixed or floating offshore installation or
       structure engaged in gas or oil exploitation, exploitation or production
       activities, or loading or unloading of oil.
(5)    Sea ports and oil handling facilities means those facilities which
       present a risk of an oil pollution incident and includes, inter alia, sea ports,
       oil terminals, pipelines and other oil handling facilities.
(6)    Organization means the International Maritime Organization.
(7)    Secretary-General means the Secretary-General of the Organization.

ARTICLE 3
(1)    (a)    Each Party shall require that ships entitled to fly its flag have
              on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan as required
              by and in accordance with the provisions adopted by the
              Organization for this purpose.*
       
*    The "provisions adopted by the Organization" refers to regulation 26
       of Annex 1 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
       Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, as amended
       (MARPOL 73/78).

                                                                             9

TAKING ACCOUNT ALSO of the importance of international
instruments on liability and compensation for oil pollution damage,
including the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil
Pollution Damage (CLC) and the 1971 International Convention on the
Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution
Damage (FUND); and the 1984 Protocols to the CLC and FUND Conventions,
and the compelling need for early entry into force of the
Conventions,

TAKING ACCOUNT FURTHER of the importance of bilateral and
multilateral agreements and arrangements in this regard,

BEARING IN MIND the relevant provisions of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, in particular of its part XII,

BEING AWARE of the need to promote international co-operation and
to enhance existing national, regional and global capabilities concerning
oil pollution preparedness and response, taking into account the special
needs of the developing countries and particularly small island States,

CONSIDERING that these objectives may best be achieved by the
conclusion of an International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness,
