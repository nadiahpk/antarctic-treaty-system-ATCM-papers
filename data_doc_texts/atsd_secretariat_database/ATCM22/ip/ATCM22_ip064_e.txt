Russian studies of the subglacial Lake Vostok

The discovery of a vast lake in central East Antarctica whose table area is comparable with Lake Ontario, has resulted from a joint effort of Russian and British scientists during the period 1964 to 1993. The name Vostok of this Antarctic lake was first officially mentioned by the Russian scientist Andrey Kapitsa at the 23d SCAR Meeting in 1994 in Rome (Italy). His presentation has caused sensation and gained worldwide recognition.

For three summer seasons beginning from 1995, the Russian Antarctic Expedition with the support of the US Antarctic Program carries out detailed seismic studies of morphology and characteristics of structure of the southern part of the lake at Vostok station.

The work was performed in two directions:

1. Studies by means of the reflected wave method (RWM) along the sub-meridional and sub-latitudinal profiles relative to the location of Vostok station.

2. Observations in a deep borehole 5G-1 by means of the vertical seismic profiling (VSP) method in order to specify the glacier structure and the features of its vertical acoustical structure.

Under the first direction during three seasons, 108 RWM soundings were made at the profiles with an overall length of 55 km. Under the second direction 61 VSP soundings were conducted within a depth range of 3350 to 2600 m before the beginning of drilling and within 3523 to 3200 m after the end of drilling in 1996-1997 and within 3616 to 3256 m in 1998.

As a result of processing and interpretation of all data obtained during these seasons, the main structural features of the ice sheet and the subice strata were determined. The ice sheet thickness at the point of location of borehole 5G-1 is 3750 m. Beneath the ice there is a water layer 670 m thick. The distance from the borehole bottom to the ice-water boundary is estimated to be 130 m. Profile measurements have allowed us to establish two types of structure of the subglacial stratum at the sections differing mainly in the presence or absence of the water layer. A preliminary data analysis indicates that the coastline of Lake Vostok and the segment where a three-layered structure (ice-water-rock) passes to a two-layered structure (ice-rock), are at a distance of 3 km westward, 4 km eastward and 4 km south-westward of the station.

North of Vostok station along a submeridional profile 6 km long, the ice sheet thickness does not actually change comprising 3750 m. The water layer thickness varies within 490 m in the south to 670 m in the north. Downward along the section between the lake bottom and the acoustic basement surface there is a layer identified as sedimentary rocks which have a complicated structure and a total thickness of 90 to 330 m.

Drilling in a deep borehole at Vostok station in January 1998 was stopped at a depth of 3623 m. The results of glaciological studies of the ice core retrieved from a deep hole at Vostok have shown layered ice bedding within a depth range 3460-3538 (stratum D in Fig. 1). It is characterized by alternating bands of fine- and coarse-grained ice layers. A single-maximum 

1
c-axis orientation and high impurity content characterize fine-grained ice 
whereas girdle-type texture and low impurity content are typical of the 
coarse-grained layers. The volumetric concentration of air-hydrates and thus 
the total gas content in the ice within the given depth range remain at the 
same level as in the upper parts of the vertical section. This suggests that 
this stratum does not differ significantly by the conditions of ice formation 
from the overlying strata. Hence, the observed layering results from a non-
uniform deformation of ice in this segment of the vertical profile.

Beneath a 3539 m depth down to the bottom depth of 3623 m there is a 
basal stratum (stratum E in Fig. 1) formed by ultra-coarse-grained ice 
containing moraine debris. In the lower stratum (3606-3623m) there is 
almost no moraine inclusions. An extremely large size of ice crystals (up to 
1 m and more) does not make it possible to determine the texture of the ice 
rock in the given layer. Such texture is usually interpreted as a result of 
recrystallization occurring under the conditions of immobile basal ice at a 
temperature close to the melting point and not experiencing significant shear 
deformations. The presence of a natural moraine within a thick basal ice 
implies that it is probable to find traces of melting and refrozen ice at a 
distance of more than 100 m from the lower surface of the ice sheet.

Sharp changes in the physical and structural ice characteristics 
observed in the lower core part influence significantly the stratum speeds of 
seismic waves.

Data of isotopic analysis of the lower core segment indicate that this 
ice does not contain paleoclimatic information and it is more likely that it is 
not connected with atmospheric origin. Data on paleoclimate variability are 
centered in the upper 3300 m layer where 4 full climate cycles are recorded 
with total duration of 426 kyr. A hypothesis about immobile ice at the ice 
sheet base can serve as an additional restriction for determination of the 
possible vertical changes in temperature of the natural ice layers and 
assessment of the ice-water contact depth.

Special study of the existing archive of geophysical data on this region 
of Antarctica has shown Lake Vostok to be confined to the inner continental 
rift zone. This zone is comparable by its crustal structure and tectonic 
location with the rift structure of other continents, for examples, the rifts of 
East Africa, Lake Baikal and St. Lawrence. This statement is based on such 
typical characteristics as:
-   length and width of the depression (more than 300 km and 50-
60 km, respectively);
-   morphology of the shore slopes (large bedrock scarps up to 
1000 m in amplitude);
-   intense negative gravity anomalies (up to 60-100 m Gl);
-   dome structure of the surrounding regional relief (mean heights 
of 500-1000 m).

Modeling of gravity anomalies in the southern part of Lake Vostok 
suggests the presence of a sufficiently thick sedimentary stratum, which can 
reach 2 km.

The precise spatial location of the rift zone under the ice sheet remains 
uncertain due to insufficient amount of morphological data. Still there is a 
2
possibility to suggest that the depression of Lake Vostok presents only a 
fragment of a vast rift zone extending west north-west of Lake Vostok up to 
meridian 95^{0}E with the change in its strike further to 60^{0}. In regional respect 
the delineated lineament is in good agreement with the general tectonic 
structure of the eastern margin of the Antarctic ice shield. It manifests 
spatial and genetic common features with the extensive rift zone of Prydz 
Bay - Lambert glacier and its proposed continuation at the foot of the 
Gamburtsev mountains. Thus, this system can in total present the largest 
inland rift belt within which there might be a chain of subglacial lakes 
located in the depressions of the rift structures.

There are serious grounds to suggest that the main phase of crustal 
extension resulting in the development of the rift zone of Lambert glacier is 
dated by the period 145-130 Ma. This event was probably responsible for 
the formation of Lake Vostok with dominance of sediments of the 
corresponding age within it.

During the period March 24-26 an international workshop "Lake 
Vostok (Antarctica) Study - Scientific Objectives and Technological 
Requirements" was held in St. Petersburg. The workshop has discussed a 
wide range of scientific and technical problems of the ongoing and future 
studies of this natural phenomenon. Sixty five specialists from 7 countries 
(France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the USA and Great Britain) 
participated in the meeting. The specialists from the NASA, the USA have 
shown a large practical interest in this problem. The latter fact is explained 
by the possibility for testing specially designed research instruments, 
engineering structures and technologies under the conditions of Antarctica 
for future studies of space objects in the Solar system among which the main 
place belongs to one of Jupiter moons - Planet Europe.

It is obvious that the subglacial antarctic Lake Vostok will become the 
last geographical discovery of the coming to an end 20^{th} century.
