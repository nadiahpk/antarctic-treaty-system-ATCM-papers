within the base and involved finishing off of the internal structure, as opposed to 
heavy outdoor construction work.

With the completion of the construction of the new base, SANAE IV has entered 
into an operational phase with minimal maintenance to be conducted on the base 
structures and systems during the annual summer seasons. Since the CEE relates 
largely to the construction of the facility, the EHSMS and related documentation is 
presently being revised to reflect this shift in focus. Additional activities, such as 
the Earth Sciences Programme and the decommissioning of redundant facilities, 
will form part of the EHSMS and the annual audit plan.
