Peruvian Activities
bearing on Compliance
with the Antarctic
Treaty Protocol on
Environmental Matters

Submitted by

INTRODUCTION

Peru, in its capacity as consultative member to the Antarctic Treaty, has initiated activities 
aimed at complying with the Protocol on Environmental Protection which has come into force 
in January of this year.

In this vein, the National Commission on Antarctic Affairs' Scientific Subcommittee set up an 
Environmental Protection Working Group , the purpose of which is the environmental 
protection relating to all Peruvian activities to be carried out in Antarctica. The specific goals 
of this group, which is a standing organization, and its composition, are detailed under item 1.

Considering the need for a rapid environmental assessment of the projects to be carried out in 
the future, the Group suggested, and it has been accepted, that for a project to be approved, the 
responsible body must fill out the Environmental Impact Assessment Guide for Peruvian 
Scientific and Logistic Activities in Antarctica, which is to be used to determine the need for 
carrying out further studies if deemed appropriate. The model of the form to be used is shown 
under item 2.

On the other hand, another activity deserving priority is the formulation of an Environmental 
Management Plan for the Machu Picchu station. To do so, an Environmental Assessment 
program including the description of the milieu, the assessment of the impact caused as well 
as the suggestion of mitigation measures and environmental monitoring has been outlined. 
This program is further detailed under item 3 of this document.

The scientific activities carried out during previous expeditions (see Annex 1) are by and large 
useful to determine the environmental baseline. Thus, enhancing the available information is a 
very important step for the Program which is commencing. The potential of the national 
institutions already pertaining to the Scientific Subcommittee as well as that of other top level 
organizations to be called upon, guarantees the success of this endeavor.

1. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WORKING GROUP

1.1. OBJECTIVES

1. To assess the Peruvian activities on scientific research, operations and logistics as well as 
any other one, Governmental or otherwise, including all changes occurring in any activity, 
in order to limit its environmental impact on Antarctica and its dependent and associated 
ecosystems.

2. To evaluate the guides and other environmental impact assessment documents bearing on 
activities to be carried out in Antarctica.

3. To appoint the person in charge of Environmental issues of the Peruvian Expedition to 
Antarctica, who is to supervise that the environmental protection measures are complied 
with.

4. To suggest that those activities considered to impact on the Antarctic Environment and its 
dependent and associated ecosystems be either modified, suspended or canceled.

5. To propose the implementation of the necessary procedures for those activities requiring 
urgent response, including preventive actions and emergencies, in the field of 
environmental protection. To revise the Contingency Plan on a regular basis.

6. To suggest research studies and projects on the Antarctic Environment.

7. To foster dissemination activities on the Protection of the Antarctic Environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT GUIDE FOR SCIENTIFIC
AND LOGISTIC ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA

The information requested will serve as a basis for preparing an environmental assessment
program of the Peruvian scientific and logistic activities to be planned and carried out in
Antarctica, in such a way that their detrimental impact on the Antarctic environment and its
dependent and associated ecosystems be limited.

Based upon this information, to be submitted by the person in charge of each activity, the
Environmental Assessment Group will indicate whether an initial environmental assessment
plan is outlined or a global environmental assessment plan calling for more detailed
information and more specialized personnel is requested.

must be reported and quantified. If the information is available, compare it against the 
species population data in the project's area of influence.

3) Indicate the quantities of solid, liquid and gaseous waste generated by the activity, and 
where they are kept.

4) Specify the expected measures for handling the waste.

5) Indicate how the electrical power demand will be met, and quantify.

6) Identify any environmental interference with the remaining activities.

7) Explain whether the logistic support for the activity's implementation will alter the local 
environment.

8) Identify and justify location alternatives for the execution of the activities.

9) Indicate whether the proposed activity will lead to significant changes in the use of natural 
resources in the region.

10) Report whether the activity will use resources from the local marine environment or from 
other oceanic areas.

11) Indicate whether the activity will bring non autochthonous animals and plants into the 
area.
