Preliminary Report

ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING
TROMSØ, NORWAY
May 25th - June 5th, 1998

Translation from Spanish Original
During the 1997 - 1998 season, the Antarctic Unit of the Instituto Fueguino de Turismo (IN.FUE.TUR) developed the Monitoring Programme of Antarctic Tourism Vessels through the port of Ushuaia.

On the basis of the survey approved by the XXI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Resolution 3 (1997), called Post Visit Report, the information obtained is synthesised below:

Transit of ships and passengers through the port of Ushuaia

The 1997-1998 season started on November 9th and ended on March 25th 1998. During this season, 11 vessels employed in Antarctic tourism operated from port Ushuaia, making 83 trips and transporting a total 8,619 passengers.

65 local trips were carried out (those that started and ended in Ushuaia) representing 78% of the total of trips made. 18 other trips were semi-local (they only started or ended in Ushuaia), representing 22% of the total. In this season there were no transit trips registered (those which neither started nor ended in Ushuaia).

11 Antarctic tourism vessels operated in the local port, 4 were flagged in Russia, 3 in Bahamas, 2 in Liberia, 1 in Denmark and 1 in Panama.

The vessels maximum capacity varied from 44 to 800 passengers. Small vessels (up to 100 passengers), carried out 59 trips transporting 3,711 persons, whilst medium sized vessels (between 101/200 passengers) transported 2,381 tourists in a total of 18 trips, and large sized vessels (over 200 passengers) transported 2.527 in a total of 6 trips.

Figure 1 indicates in each case: ships flag, charter companies, maximum passenger capacity, number of trips carried out, and total number of passengers transported:

Comparative analysis with previous seasons

In the 1997- 98 season an increase of 35% was registered in the number of passengers that visited Antarctica through the port of Ushuaia, from 6,389 in the 1996-97 season to 8,619 in the present season. We can also observe a decrease of 12% in the number of trips, 94 registered for the 1996-97 season against 83 trips in this last season.

We can infer that the increase in the number of passengers and the decrease in the number of trips is related with the presence of large sized vessels that, as opposed to the previous year, did operate this season.

Figure 2 shows the totals of trips and passengers of the past 7 seasons:

* Note: Data referring to seasons between 1991-92 were provided by Ushuaia's Prefectura Naval Argentina, as up until then there was no specific Antarctic traffic monitoring programme underway in Tierra del Fuego. Such data is included in this report for strictly indicative purposes.

Comparative analysis of Antarctic tourism by sea from Ushuaia in relation
to world totals

An increase of approximately 24% was observed in the number of
world passengers that visited the Antarctic continent. The Antarctic Unit of
the IN.FUE.TUR estimated, in accordance with the information brought by
the tourism operator enterprises at the beginning of the 1997-98 season, a
total of 9,380 passengers. Of that total, 8,619 passengers passed through at
least once through the local port. This number indicates that 92% of the
passengers used the port of Ushuaia to visit the Antarctic continent by sea,
registering the highest percentage of the past 6 seasons.

Figure 3 shows a comparative analysis of the above.
