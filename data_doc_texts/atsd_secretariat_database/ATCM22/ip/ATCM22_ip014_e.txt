HANDLING OF SOLID WASTE AND WASTE WATER ON BOARD THE 
"HUMBOLDT" SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH VESSEL

During the 9th Peruvian Scientific expedition to Antarctica, the various wastes on board the BIC Humboldt were 
classified as follows:

-    Waste waters
-    Organic solid waste
-    Inorganic solid waste
-    Fuel and lubricants

Waste waters

During the navigation stage, en route to Antarctica, these are gradually eliminated. When the vessel stays in 
Antarctic waters, waste waters are stored in specially conditioned tanks. These waste water are then dumped in 
areas where there is a proper circulation current.

Organic solid waste

These are stored in properly sealed containers and then kept in cooling chambers on board the vessel. Then they 
are transported to the Callao harbor.

Inorganic solid waste

These are subdivided into:

    Steel components, tin plates, metals in general
    Wood, cardboard and other cellulose by-products
    Plastics and miscellaneous
    Glass

These materials were stored according to the previous classification, in conveniently conditioned containers, 
then they were taken to the BIC Humboldt's holds and transported to the Callao harbor.

Fuel and lubricants

They were stored in properly sealed, waterprofen and labeled cylinders according to their contents, then they 
were transported to the Callao harbor to be disposed of.
