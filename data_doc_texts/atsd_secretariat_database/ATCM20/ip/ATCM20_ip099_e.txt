EXPEDITION LEADER'S NOTEBOOK (TABLE OF CONTENTS)

Information Paper submitted to the XX ATCM

(Agenda Item 15)

Submitted by IAATO

Each IAATO member has an environmental officer and manager of field operations, who is responsible for communicating the obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System to its field staff. Most of these individuals have been active in Antarctica for decades with considerable experience in the field. This same person is the contact listed in the IAATO Membership Directory. They are responsible for the notebooks used by Expedition Leaders. Such notebooks contain Antarctic Treaty System documents, briefing and safety guidelines, procedures, emergency contingency plans and information on landing sites.

The following is a sample Table of Contents from the expedition leader's notebooks prepared by Quark Expeditions, 980 Post Road, Darien CT 06820 USA. The notebooks are divided into several large 3-ring binders sent to each vessel and maintained at the home office. Recently revised, this up-dated version will be in final form and available for use on all ships operated by Quark Expeditions in the 1996-97 Antarctic season.

The other members of IAATO have comparable field manuals for their expedition leaders, tailored to their own operations. As one of its goals, IAATO fosters cooperation and exchange of information among its members to improve and standardize operations. The Expedition Leader's Notebook is a vital document for safe and responsible operation in the Antarctic -- and its content is the subject of ongoing discussions among IAATO members.

IAATO would welcome comment on this outline. National operators, Treaty Parties, SCAR, COMNAP and other interested parties have generously contributed educational materials and copies of their own field manuals over the years, which have been incorporated into the notebooks used by members. We share a common goal of safe, efficient and environmentally-responsible Antarctic operations.
