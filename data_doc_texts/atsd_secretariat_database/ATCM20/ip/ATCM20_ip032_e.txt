POSSIBLE ERRORS IN THE RULES
OF PROCEDURE

(Agenda item 7a)

(Submitted by Australia)
POSSIBLE ERRORS IN THE RULES
OF PROCEDURE

1.    The purpose of this paper is to draw the attention of Parties to errors 
in the ATCM Rules of Procedure as presented in the 8th edition 
of the Handbook of the Antarctic Treaty System.

2.    Delegations will recall that the Rules of Procedure for the ATCM 
have been modified from time to time to reflect the operational requirements 
of the meeting. For example, the Rules of Procedure were modified at 
ATCM XIX to reflect the decision that the ATCM can produce Measures, 
Decisions and Resolutions (see Decision 2/1995).

3.    The Rules of Procedure are not found in one consolidated document 
? the latest consolidated version appears in the 1994 edition of the Antarctic 
Treaty Handbook (page 280 of the Handbook), and represents 
the Rules as adopted in 1992 at ATCM XVII. The Australian delegation 
notes that this Handbook is not an authoritative text.

4.    The Australian delegation is aware of the following errors relating to 
the ATCM Rules of Procedure which are drawn to the attention of the 
Parties:

i.    What passes for the 1987 Rules of Procedure (page 275 of the 1994 
Handbook) is significantly different from the authoritative text of 
these as set out in ANT/XIV/Inf/2 of 21 July 1987. In addition, when 
ATCM XVII (1992) revised the Rules it appears to have used as a basis 
the 1987 Rules as they appeared in the (then) Handbook; unfortunately, 
the Handbook version was not consistent with the authoritative version 
of ANT/XIV/Inf/2. The result was that the 1992 amendments and consolida-
tion carry through the errors that had been earlier introduced into an earlier 
edition of the Handbook. In particular, amendments were made in 1992 to 
correct erroneous cross references in rules 6 and 14 of the 1987 Rules of 
Procedure, when there had been no error in the first place (the rules set out in 
ANT/XIV/Inf/2 do not contain the error but the version in the Handbook 
does).

ii.    The 1992 consolidation of the Rules in the ATCM XVII report does 
not accord with the amendments approved in 1992 (as set out in 
XVII/WP24/Rev.1) ; Rule 31 is missing from the consolidation and two 
words are missing from Rule 38, as follows:

"At the end of each Consultative Meeting, the Meeting shall decide 
which international organisations having a scientific or technical 
interest in Antarctica shall be invited to designate an expert to attend the 
forthcoming Meeting in order to assist in its substantive work."

iii.    The reproduction of the 1992 consolidation (which is the latest 
published consolidation) in the 1994 version of the Handbook reproduces
the errors introduced in the ATCM XVII report, and adds one more ; in Rule 30(b)(iii) the reference should be to Recommendation IV-19, not to the non-existent Recommendation IX-19.

5.      While these errors may not be significant in themselves it does highlight the need to maintain access to source documents.
