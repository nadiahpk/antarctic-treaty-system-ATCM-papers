PROTECTION OF THE ANTARTIC ENVIRONMENT
COMPLIANCE FORMS

(Agenda Item 18)

Submitted by Argentina)
PROTECTION OF THE ANTARTIC ENVIRONMENT

COMPLIANCE FORMS

The activities carried out in the Antarctic by the Republic of Argentina are subject to a preliminary evaluation of their potential environmental impact. The evaluation is based on questionnaires filled by the person in charge of the activity, which cover the following information:

•   logistics (handling of fuel, transportation, waste disposal);

•   works (construction, dismantling, remodelling);

•   collection of samples to check for possible harmful interference with native flora and fauna and the introduction of non native species;

•   entry into protected sites.

Under the commitments arising from the Antartic Treaty, measures have been recommended to prevent possible harmful effects resulting from scientific and logistic activities. One of these steps is filling compliance forms (attached to this document) in order to assess possible impacts and, if applicable, implement measures aimed at preventing or minimizing such impact.

PROTECTION OF THE ANTARTIC ENVIRONMENT

In accordance with the provisions of the Madrid Protocol, all activities planned for present and future Antartic Campaigns shall be subject to a preliminary evaluation of their potential environmental impact. Information on these activities must be conveyed to the National Antartic Directorate (DNA) for evaluation purposes, within the following deadlines:

i.      Activities covered by the Antartic Annual Plan: Before May 30. (Any major change in these activities should be immediately reported to the DNA, for evaluation purposes.) This category included logistics connected to the provisioning of stations and field camps, all the scientific programs, requests for the collection of samples, and entry into Specially Protected Areas.

ii.     Activities not covered by the Antartic Annual Plan: 12 months in advance. Activities not included in (i) fall within this category, for example, construction, dismantling of existing structures, maintenance of existing structures requiring major logistic infrastructure, recreational activities, etc.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING THE FORMS

Note:  Each form to be filled should cover its corresponding activity and should include:

1)      Report on logistic activities, to evaluate their impact on the environment.  This information must be included if the activity has its own logistics (whether in the station or in the field camp).

2)      Technical information required to evaluate environmental impact.  This information must be included if the activity provides for construction, remodelling or dismantling of a structure.

Reminder:  The preliminary impact evaluation should be carried out one year before operations begin.

3)      Application for taking samples, harmful interference with native flora and fauna or the introduction of species.  This information must be included if the activity provides for the introduction of species, the collection of samples, or any actions involving native flora or fauna.

4)      Specially protected area.  Permit request.  This information must be included if the activity is to be carried out within the boundaries of a Site of Special Scientific Interest or a Specially Protected Area, whether the activity is a research plan or any other logistic activity (for example, maintenance of shelters, beacons, etc.).

or fossil organisms should be included in this application.

² "Harmful interference" means the flight or landing of helicopters or other aircraft to the extent that they disturb the 
concentration of birds and seals; the use of vehicles or vessels, including air-cushioned vehicles and small boats, to the 
extent that they disturb the concentration of birds and seals; the use of explosives and firearms to the extent that they disturb 
the concentration of birds and seals; the intentional disturbance of breeding and moulting of birds or the concentration of 
birds and seals by anyone going on foot; any significant damage to the concentration of native land vegetation from the 
landing of aircraft, from driving vehicles or from walking on these plants or by any other means; and any activity that might 
lead to major adverse changes in the habitat of any species or population of mammals, birds, plants or native invertebrates.

³ The only types of species that can be introduced are household plants and animals, and laboratory plants (including 
virus, bacteria, yeast, and fungi) and, in all cases, for purposes of scientific experiments.
