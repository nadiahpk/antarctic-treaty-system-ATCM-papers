1. Summary

During the Austral summer of 1995/96 Adventure Consultants Limited, a private tourism operator based in Christchurch, New Zealand plans to operate it's fifth mountaineering expedition to the Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica.

This document is designed for the purpose of an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) as required by the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994.

It is our conclusion that the overall impact of the proposed mountaineering activity will be no more than minor or transitory on the Antarctic environment.

3. Description of the proposed activity

The proposed activity is for a lightweight, self-contained four person mountaineering expedition to climb in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains in West Antarctica. A small field camp (base camp) will be established at 2500 metres at the head of the Crosswell Glacier on the east side of the Sentinel Range. From this location attempts will first be made to scale Vinson Massif, the highest point on the continent. Alpine style climbing techniques will be employed throughout. This means the team will move in a self-contained manner fully equipped at all times and not be involved in any relaying of equipment up and down the mountain. Minimising the equipment carried onto the peaks also reduces the potential for any equipment to be abandoned. After returning to the base camp and resting, an attempt will be made to scale Mount Tyree using a similar climbing style. It is intended that the expedition will be in the field for a period of about 18 days.

5. Location

We propose to establish a temporary field camp at 2,500 metres on the upper reaches of the Crosswell glacier below Mount Tyree and Mount Epperley. The exact location will be decided upon in consultation with the aircraft pilot after an aerial reconnaissance of the landing zone. This area is extensively glaciated. Refer to the attached maps for the field camp location.

The only established camp in the Ellsworth Range is ANI's base camp situated on the Branscomb Glacier. This is not a suitable camp for our programme as it is situated on the opposite side of the mountain range. While this camp may appear in close proximity to our proposed route it is separated by the 5000 metre high mountain range. When the only means of travel is on foot these locations are several days walk from one another.

Whilst considering the impact of camps it is important to understand what meaning the term camp has for a lightweight mountaineering expedition. For us a camp will involve pitching several 5 kg mountain tents for overnight accommodation. All equipment utilised has to be transported by the members in their rucksacks. (Government programmes have tended to call any field establishment less than a base or station, a camp. Some of these require several plane loads of equipment to house 50 people complete with kitchen, living quarters and showers) So the term is very general and can be misleading. Maybe the term 'temporary mountain bivouac' would be more appropriate for our expedition?

8. Transport and logistical support

We propose to engage the services of Adventure Network International 
(ANI) for transporting the expedition to and from the Ellsworth 
Mountains.  ANI are now in their tenth year of operation and have a 
good track record of conducting a safe and environmentally sound 
organisation. This will be the fifth year our company has used ANI 
services in this region of Antarctica.

ANI now operate a South African chartered Hercules aircraft between 
Punta Arenas, at the tip of Chile, and Patriot Hills at 80 degrees 20 
minutes South where they have located a summer tent camp as a base 
for logistical support on the continent. (see diagram on following 
page)

We plan to use a ski equipped Twin Otter aircraft (Ken Borek Air) to 
fly from Patriot Hills to the Ellsworth Mountains.

Daily HF Radio contact will be maintained with Patriot Hills.  A 
second Twin Otter is available at Patriot Hills for emergency purposes 
and provides backup for the first aircraft.

ANI has already completed an IEE which was presented at the XVIII 
Antarctic Treaty meeting in Kyoto. This IEE was prepared for ANI 
by Poles Apart in December 1993. ANI have also applied for and 
received a company permit from NSF for all US citizens.  Attached 
is an article about the ANI base at Patriot Hills.

Patriot Hills Camp

OUR CAMP AT PATRIOT HILLS IS LIKE NO OTHER PLACE ON EARTH. If you want to be really remote - this is it. At 80 degrees 20 minutes south, we are 600 nautical miles from the nearest habitation - the distance from New York to Chicago, or Paris to Madrid. For almost 1800 miles in any direction there is not a city or town. Our nearest neighbours are at the South Pole!

After an eight hour flight from the southern tip of Chile, you will arrive at Patriot Hills camp in the heart of central Antarctica. When your aircraft leaves to return to Chile, you will be struck by the awesome expanse of the area, its beauty and isolation.

You are now in an area with 24 hours of daylight, accessible only by aircraft. Summer temperatures vary from 0°C (32°F) as a midday high to occassionally minus 20 degrees C when the sun is obscured. The weather here originates mostly from the South Pole. Winds, called "catabatic" can gust up to 100 knots as they blow outward from the Pole to the coast. They can carry snow and cold temperatures with them. Generally, we expect winds of 10-15 knots. The air is as dry as in Wyoming or Colorado, thus minus 10 degrees C (14°F) is reasonably comfortable, though a windproof jacket is useful. The camp, however, is warm and snug in even the most severe weather.

ANI's facility at Patriot Hills is the only private camp operating in Antarctica. It comfortably houses 20 visitors and has a complete kitchen and eating area.

Patriot Hills was chosen by ANI as our base seven years ago to take advantage of the first bare ice runway to be used in Antarctica. This, the most southerly runway in the world, is a natural phenomenon. The first wheeled landings in the heart of the continent were done here. All other landings in Antarctica are by ski-equipped aircraft. We have now made over 60 landings and take-offs in large aircraft on the Patriot Hills ice-runway, and boast an accident-free record.

Isolated though our camp might be, there is a lot going on, in a relaxed sort of way. You will share the camp with world-class mountaineers and photo journalists as well as adventure travellers such as yourself. The flexible routine allows you to be as active or as relaxed as you wish to be. 24 hour daylight means no necessity for a schedule. If one wanted to go for a walk all night - the sun is lower and the longer shadows make for more interesting photography - no problem!

There are many places to visit close to the camp that are surprisingly varied. The topography in Antarctic encourages contemplation and photography. In a mystical way one can get to feel the slow movement of the ice as it carves past the mountains on its passage to the sea, 400 miles away.

"The landforms are different.
The snow has been drifting here for
thousands of years, just as it is now"
says ANI's camp manager. "You get a
feeling for how the planet evolved and
how short a time humans have been
around. We work with the snow and
the wind. It's great to go for a bracing
walk or to jump on the skis and get
towed off down-wind with a kite".
Just flying one of our 'Skygrazer' kites
is exhilarating.

Not everything is snow. Surround-
ing you are the varied rock peaks of the
Ellsworth Mountains rising straight up
from the heart of centuries-old glaciers.
Vivid blue skies contrast sharply with
the white of the snow and the grey of
exposed rock. Just a mile from camp is a
1500-foot ridge of rock, 4 miles long.
There are several easy routes to the top
and a challenging scramble along the
length of the ridge, in places knife-
edged.

There are other ranges of hills a
short skidoo ride away - some of them
not yet climbed. One can go out for an
overnight with a tent to make an ascent
or even build an igloo. For that matter,
we can show you how to build an igloo
at camp - you could even live in it if
you wanted to.

During the occasional Antarctic
blizzard one can experience the classic
"white-out" of the early explorers, and
do as they did - wait out the storm,
however in much more comfortable
conditions. There are indoor games,
magazines and a few books. Many
people bring books down and make the
gesture of leaving them behind for
future guests. An exchange is usually
no problem. The camp staff will do
their best to keep you entertained while
everyone waits for the storm to abate.
The wealth of experience brought to
Patriot Hills by our staff and guests
ensures fascinating discussions at table.

Once the weather clears, our two
ski-equipped light aircraft give visitors
the ability to have a better look around.
These are not ordinary flights - apart
from the spectacular scenery, one can
talk to the pilot in the air and tell him
what you want to see. "Let's do a quick
circuit here and have another
look".

The atmosphere in the camp is informal. "I've been
with ANI in Antarctic since
1987 and still find all the
clients interesting and enthu-
siastic on arrival in Patriot
Hills and an ambassador on
Antarctica on departure",
says the most experienced
pilot in Antarctica, Brydon Knibbs.

The main tents include: the camp
kitchen/dining tent which is 12' x 48'
and stands 6' 6" high and a workshop/
store tent. Two 12' x 16' sleeping tents
nearby hold up to 5 beds each and
smaller tents for staff complete the
camp.

The main tents have full sized
entrance doors, windows and insulated
floors. The living/kitchen tent has a
large dining table, a cooker and a stove
that runs 24 hours providing hot water
produced by melting snow. Primitive
hot showers can be taken in another tent
although most people find a sponge
bath more convenient. There are toilet
igloos and you will be instructed in an
important aspect of environmental
conservation.

Guests sleep in the two large tents
on cots provided with mattress and
pillow. You are expected to bring and
use your own sleeping bag. Sleeping
tents can be heated by propane heaters
in very cold weather. But normally, we
find the warmth of the midnight sun
enough to keep them comfortable.
Climbers and traverse expedition
members are expected to sleep in their
own tents unless there is plenty of room
in camp. This is good practice, anyway,
before going out in the field. Cooking
and eating for all guests and staff is
done in the dining tent.

The camp menu is as varied as
possible. Apart from our ample stock of
canned and freeze-dried foodstuffs, we
regularly fly in fresh meat, eggs,
vegetables an fruit from Chile. We
make it a point of honour to treat our
visitors hospitably. We want your total
Patriot Hills experience to be positive
and unforgettable.

PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER
10.0  Purpose of the Activity and Likely 
Impacts of the Activity

The purpose of the expedition is to establish new climbing routes on 
Vinson Massif and Mount Tyree, the two highest peaks in Antarctica.

Vinson Massif was first climbed in 1966/67 by an American 
expedition from the west side of the mountain. Since the formation 
of Adventure Network in 1985, regular summer access to the 
Ellsworth Mountains has become a reality and now the peak has been 
climbed by approximately 150 people.

When peaks are first climbed it is usually via the easiest route to the 
summit. Subsequently mountaineers will look to challenge themselves 
by ascending less obvious or more difficult routes. For example, 
while Mt Cook was originally climbed via the North ridge in 1894, 
now all of its 12 ridges and faces have been ascended. More than 
that, all but one of these routes have been ascended during the winter 
season and the peak has been skied and even descended by parapente. 
This desire to open new routes or achieve something previously 
undone is central to the whole philosophy of mountaineering.  So 
while it is possible for our expedition to climb Vinson Massif via the 
normal route from the west it is not attractive for us to do so.

Mt Tyree has only had two previous ascents.  The first was by the 
same American team who climbed Vinson Massif in 1966/67. The 
second climb was a solo ascent by Mugs Stump in 1989 via the west 
face and arguably the most difficult climb so far achieved in 
Antarctica. A total of three people have reached this summit. Neither 
of these established routes is suitable for our team.  The former is 
simply too far away from our proposed base camp (the American team 
had snow mobiles which we do not have) and the latter has a technical 
standard which is beyond the skill of our team. Therefore our only 
option in attempting Mount Tyree is to open a new route to the
summit. The east face of the mountain provides this opportunity.

Our impact on this environment will be minimal as we will proceed 
in a self contained manner on foot, storing our human waste for 
retrieval during the descent.

No known biological communities exist in this part of Antarctica.

The physical trail we make in the snow fields has only a very 
temporary impact as the ever present wind blows over the terrain to 
return it to its natural state within a few days, sometimes within hours. 
Similarly tent platforms which we level on the inclined snow slopes 
quickly re-form after we depart.

The vast majority of climbers (probably 95 percent) who have visited 
the Ellsworth range have come for the purpose of climbing the Vinson 
Massif as one of the coveted Seven Summits (highest point on each of 
the seven continents). Their interest has been to reach the summit of 
the highest peak in Antarctica via the easiest approach.

The original ascents took place from a base camp established further 
north from the current Branscomb glacier camp. The initial approach 
involved a steep climb up a snow couloir which was difficult for many 
climbers. Rob Hall and Mugs Stump working as field guides for the 
Arizona State University Geological Programme (NSF - Ed Stump 
1989) established the route on the Branscomb which is now used by 
the ANI programmes. ANI decided to make this change based on a 
safety recommendation from these two guides in 1990.

Most of the activity in recent times has centred on the Branscomb 
glacier approach to the mountain. All of the ANI expeditions have 
been conducted in a lightweight style which means that groups have 
moved quickly, utilising minimal equipment and supplies. A round 
trip from the base camp to the summit and back normally takes about 
7 days.
The base camp consists of a single Weather Haven tent approximately 
5 metres x 3 metres. This tent is used for cooking and rewarming. 
Climbers sleep in their own mountain tents pitched nearby while they 
are resident. The skiway for ANI aircraft, which is marked by black 
snow-filled plastic bags, is nearby.

The climbers normally use three camp sites between the base camp 
and the summit. Each camp is established and removed as the 
climbing team proceeds up the mountain in a self-contained manner. 
During the season (November - January) a small cache of emergency 
food and fuel accumulates at the highest of these three camps. As a 
group completes its ascent it may cache food and fuel for the safety of 
a group following behind. (For use if storm-bound by bad weather) 
These caches are removed by ANI staff during the final climb ascent 
of the season.

In using a base camp on the Crosswell Glacier (see map and photos), 
instead of the ANI Branscomb Glacier camp further to the west, the 
expedition is using an area seldom visited for its attempts on the 
Vinson Massif and Mt Tyree.

Human waste is bagged in plastic at each camp during the ascent and 
collected by the same team on the return journey. This waste along 
with all packaging and waste products is returned to Patriot Hills and 
flown back to South America.

ANI has strictly enforced its policy of self-containment for all of its 
expeditions. As a result the impact on the mountain has been 
negligible and if it wasn't for the occasional marker wand left standing 
in the snow it would be easy to convince a new visitor that they were 
making the first ascent of the mountain! This philosophy and practice 
pursued by ANI and mountaineering expeditions to this area has 
mitigated against any of the activities over the last 30 years having had 
more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.
The extremely hostile environment of the Ellsworth mountains offers some environmental protection for this area in that visitors need to be both experienced (and one can hope educated), highly organised, and environmentally sensitive. Unplanned activities without thought given to impacts are not possible in this remote region.

### 10.1 _Intensity_

The expedition will consist of four members. Rob Hall, the expedition leader is the only New Zealand citizen included in the expedition. With a planned duration of around 3 weeks the impact intensity of this activity on the environment is rated as low.

### 10.2 _Alternatives_

The only viable alternative to the Crosswell Glacier camp is to use the ANI Branscomb Glacier camp. This option has not been considered as it would not allow the party to achieve the objective of climbing both the Vinson Massif and Mt Tyree. The Branscomb Glacier option was also not considered for the reasons outlined in 10.0. pertaining to the Purpose of the Activity.
10.3   Cumulative Impacts

Cumulative impacts are not considered relevant to our expedition because the expedition is pioneering new routes on the Vinson Massif and Mt Tyree. Any cumulative impacts, or any direct or indirect effects, would come from an assessment of mountaineering activities in the Ellsworth Mountains over the last 30 years. In the expedition leader's experience in the Ellsworths over the last 5 years, these impacts and effects on the environment have been negligible owing to the nature and intensity of the activity that has occurred.

10.4   Monitoring

The expedition leader will monitor, at all times, the impact of the party on the environment, based on his experience of 4 previous expeditions to the Ellsworth Mountains.  An evaluation of any observed impacts on the environment will be made by the expedition leader in his post-visit report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade, expecially with regard to:

    waste disposal;
    retrograding of all gear and equipment brought into the area;
    the restoration of camp and tent site facilities;
    any impact made by the party on the new routes.
11.0 _Self-sufficiency_

The expedition will be fully self-contained with equipment and provisions suitable for this type of activity. The expedition leader is recognised as New Zealand’s most experienced expedition leader and is also an expert in Antarctic survival procedures. The other expedition members are suitably trained and experienced for this mountaineering objective.

In the event of an accident or emergency situation, ANI staff will support the expedition, provide medical assistance and evacuation from the continent if required.

No government bases are located in this region and consequently no visits to any government stations are planned.

11.1 _Insurance_

The expedition has elected not to carry any external insurance cover. The costs of rescue or evacuation are underwritten by ourselves in agreement with ANI.
●  12.  Classifying the activity

The best published reference available to classify our activity is the
'Guide to Environment Impact Assessment of activities in Antarctica'
(April 1995) by the Polar Section, South Atlantic and Antarctic
Department Foreign Commonwealth Office London, which states

"Activities where there are likely to be only a negligible
[environmental] impact include: small lightweight adventure
expeditions using tents for temporary accommodation and Aircraft
operations using unprepared ice and snow fields or skidways."

Thus the projected impact of the proposed activity for a limited period
and involving a small number of people is the basis of the
classification that the activity will have no more than a minor or
transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

14.0  ANI capability

Adventure Network's statement of capability is attached in the following pages. This includes their environmental policy.

14.1  Human Waste disposal

The greatest potential impact that our small group will have on the Antarctic environment will be the dumping of human waste.

In keeping with our own policy, and that of ANI, strict control over human waste disposal will be exercised.

At the expedition's basecamp both liquid and solid human waste will be collected for removal from the continent. This will be returned to Patriot Hills, along with the "grey" water, at the end of the expedition.

While climbing on the mountain, solid waste will be collected in plastic bags at the various bivouac sites and carried back down to the base camp on the return journey.

This system of management has been used during all of our previous visits to this region and is strictly enforced by the expedition leader.

14.2  Rubbish disposal

All equipment and supplies, including the packaging for foodstuffs will be returned with the expedition team to Punta Arenas for appropriate distribution and disposal. In keeping with our own mountain policy and philosophy we intend to leave our field camp locations in pristine condition.
Adventure Network
INTERNATIONAL


Policy and operational guidelines we observe in providing and 
supporting aircraft and land-based, private-sector travel to and 
within Antarctica.

Adventure Network International and their contractors undertake to:

*   Know and understand the relevant provisions of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty and Annexes, and shall wherever practicable, fully 
comply with those provisions, whether or not their own 
country has issued legislation to require compliance. 
They will also ensure that all staff and clients are 
properly briefed on those provisions that might affect 
them.

*   Operate flights and programs such that maximum safety for 
all participants and with minimum impact on the Antarctic 
environment is assured.

*   Establish a set of policies and emergency procedures that 
will be applicable to all foreseeable accidents and 
unplanned events that might occur with the operations.

*   Provide pilots, guides and support personnel who have had 
adequate training and experience, in the context of 
Antarctica, to cope with anticipated conditions, 
potential problems and reasonably foreseeable 
emergencies.

*   Arrange back-up aircraft to be available for all air and 
land-based activity.

*   Verify that all participants are in adequate physical 
condition to cope with the anticipated physiological, 
topographic and climatic rigours that will be 
encountered.

*   Maintain regular radio contact between their operational 
aircraft or field parties and their base of field 
operations, and between field base and the outside world. 
This will include maintaining a listening radio watch 
while any of their aircraft are in the air.

*   Provide all aircraft with appropriate survival equipment 
and emergency supplies to support the crew and all 
passengers for at least two weeks.
*     Establish and maintain at adequate levels, caches of fuel 
      to enable the emergency evacuation by air of injured or 
      sick personnel to the nearest medical facility.

*     Establish and maintain at adequate levels, caches of 
      camping equipment, food, cooking fuel and medical 
      supplies to enable all personnel, staff and clients, to 
      survive in the field for at least 30 days without re-
      supply from outside.

*     Maintain close working collaboration with the appropriate 
      aeronautical authorities, civil and military for air 
      traffic control, Search and Rescue, meteorological 
      reports etc. and contact with other air operators.

*     Maintain a policy of having all aircraft under their 
      control available at all times to respond, if required, 
      to an emergency in Antarctica.

*     Operate aircraft such that populations of birds and seals 
      are not subjected to stress, such as landing or taking 
      off, low flying, air drops etc. within 1500 metres (1 
      mile) of breeding colonies

*     Take all reasonable precautions that fuel etc. stored in 
      caches does not leak or is spilled during re-fuelling 
      operations. Fuel caches located in areas of snow 
      accumulation and/or glacier movement, will be marked with 
      adequate beacons to enable recovery at a later date.

*     Remove from Antarctica for sanitary disposal back in 
      civilization, all refuse (including human waste) 
      generated at their operational bases. Wherever feasible 
      and consistent with associated environmental impact, 
      collect and remove refuse generated by their field 
      parties, including empty fuel drums etc.

                                                 summit. The plan that the trio had developed
                                                 to reach their goal could be used to help
                                                 others - ANI-Antarctica was launched.

                                                 Two years later, ANI-Antarctica built a
                                                 temporary base camp at the Patriot Hills,
                                                 100 miles from Mt. Vinson in the Ellsworth
                                                 Mountains. This tented camp, alongside
                                                 a natural runway on bare, "blue-ice", became
                                                 the focus for all subsequent ANI-Antarctica's
                                                 programs. That same year ANI-Antarctica
                                                 flew the first group of private visitors to
                                                 the South Pole. The following season ANI-

                                                 expedition support services.

                                                 privately owned by Martyn Williams, Mike

## PROGRAMS

## Mt. Vinson Guided Climbs

Since 1985, we have organized and led teams of mountaineers to Mount Vinson, at 16,067 ft. the highest peak in Antarctica - and thus one of the "Seven Summits", the highest points on each of the seven continents. With our support, over 150 climbers have scaled Vinson Massif and other surrounding peaks.

## South Pole Expeditions

We have led overland ski and dogsled parties both to the Pole and from the Pole to the Ross Ice Shelf. We have also positioned film crews documenting these expeditions. We have flown private clients from our Patriot Hills base camp to the Pole on a regular basis - the only private organization in the world to have done so.

## Other Antarctic Interior Programs

Each year since 1986 we have expanded the range of programs offered from our camp at Patriot Hills (80 degrees South). We offer ski touring, experiential visits and airborne wild-life safaris on the Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. In late 1991 we flew the first ever group of private-sector photographers to a major rookery of Emperor penguins on the Weddell Sea.

Our flexibility at organizing trips allows us to custom design specialty outings for private individuals or groups.

## Ships Programs

Know-how developed by transporting our own fuel supplies from southern Chile to the coast of Antarctica has evolved into ship-based tourism programs. We have chartered ships, generally ice-class hydrographic research vessels, in logistic support of ornithological, cetacean and oceanographic teams of scientists, journalists and amateur naturalists. Destinations currently include South Shetland Islands, Antarctic Peninsula, Falklands and South Georgia, Filchner (Weddell Sea) and Ross Sea.

We have established working relationships with owners/agents for ships varying in size from a 500 ton coastal steamer to "ROSSIA" the largest ice-breaker in the world.

## Non-Antarctic Activities

Owners and senior staff of ANI have world-wide adventure travel experience. One has achieved all Seven Summits, another guided a successful Everest ascent, yet a third has pioneered adventure cruises throughout the oceans of the world - including the first commercial voyage to the North Pole. One member recently participated in the first ski traverse of the length of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic.

This expertise has been incorporated into the new package of programs offered to clients of ANI, projecting the company's sphere of activity to remote adventure challenges throughout the world.
RESOURCES

We know our clients respond
best to programs that are new,
unusual, or "first". This is the area that
ANI specializes in and has built its
reputation around. This will remain
our primary focus in planning our
schedule for the future years.

            PERSONNEL

All five directors of ANI, including
two of the founders, are involved in the
company's operations - acting as
program creators, logistics supervisors,
lead guides, and participating in line
management - as well as business
development and policy-setting
functions.

Overall coordination is delegated
to the Managing Director with full-time
office and financial support.

Since the company's activities to
date have been focused on the limited
Antarctic season, the majority of the
personnel are employed on a seasonal
contract basis - but most of those have
several seasons of operations with us.

ANI places much value and
reliance on its Chilean subsidiary. With
offices in Santiago and Punta Arenas,
Adventure Network Chile maintains
the excellent working relationship with
the host government that is essential to
our success. Influential, knowledgeable
and bi-lingual directors of ANChile
ensure close coordination between the
expatriate specialists, clients, Chilean
authorities and local facilities.

            FACILITIES

ANI maintains its principal office
in Vancouver, Canada, the management
centre for its operations world wide.
During the Antarctic season (September
through March) ANI shares offices with
ANChile in Punta Arenas, Chile. These
offices form the Antarctic operations
headquarters. During the rest of the

year ANChile is based in Santiago,
since the major part of off-season
activity is spent in liaison with central
government entities.

During the Antarctic field season
(mid October through mid February),
ANI maintains a tented base camp at
Patriot Hills, Ellsworth Mountains at 80
deg. S, 81 W about 600 nautical miles
from the South Pole. The camp can
accommodate up to 50 persons and is
strategically situated alongside a
natural "blue-ice" runway where the
heavy cargo/passenger aircraft used
by ANI can safely land. It is an
6-hour flight from Punta Arenas to
Patriot Hills.

There is a radio-link with a twice-
daily schedule, between the office in
Punta Arenas and Patriot Hills camp.
We also maintain constant radio-contact
with ANI aircraft while airborne.

The key to travel within the
Antarctic is supply of fuel. At various
strategic locations in Western Antarctica
and the Peninsula, ANI has established
caches of fuel (Jet, Avgas, Mogas and
stove fuel). ANI had invested heavily in
establishing and re-supplying their
network of fuel caches to service and
extend their area of operational
capability.

            EQUIPMENT

ANI owns and operates a ski-
equipped Cessna C185 aircraft based at
Patriot Hills. It is used primarily for air
support to expeditions and has made
several flights to the South Pole.

ANI contracts with experienced
high-latitude aircraft operators for ski-
equipped Twin Otter aircraft, both for
basing at Patriot Hills and for work
between Punta Arenas and the
Peninsula.

ANI also contact with experienced
operators of larger transport aircraft
for the season's operations between

            VEHICLES

Apart from normal cars and vans
for local transportation in Punta
Arenas, ANI has several specialized
vehicles for snow and ice mobility -
skidoos and All Terrain Vehicles and a
quantity of sleds, komatiks, pulks, etc.
For navigation purposes, we have GPS
(Global Positioning Systems), as well as
the more conventional sextants, sun
compasses, etc. We also maintain
Zodiacs with outboard motors for
inshore marine transportation.

            ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

In 1992 ANI requested Poles Apart,
International Polar Consultants (UK &
Australia) to produce an Initial
Environmental Evaluation (IEE) on all
our operations in the Antarctic. To date
we have been diligent with a self-
imposed company policy that states
"Everything we take in, we take out
even if it is eaten first." All garbage,
and human waste are returned to Punta
Arenas where it is disposed of properly.
All guides on Vinson Massif are
now required to bring human waste
down from the mountain to base camp
where ANI then take responsibility for
its removal from the continent. The
purpose of IEE is to demonstrate ANI
to be at the forefront in complying with
Antarctic Treaty requirements and to
show our clients that we care enough
about Antarctica to impose the strict
and costly regulations on ourselves.
With feedback from these other nations
perhaps we can reduce any impact on
the environment.
SAFETY POLICY

Adventure Network programs in the Antarctic are planned to provide maximum safety for all participants, with minimal impact on the environ-
ment. To this end, programs are op-
erated with the following precautions
and safety measures in place:

1. Back-up aircraft for all operations.                  5. All refuse (including human waste)
