APPLICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EIA PROCEDURES

REF.: Item 18 of the Provisional Agenda of the XX ATCM (Information Paper)

Reflecting the preoccupations of the Consultative Parties of the Antarctic Treaty about the environment, out of which came the signature of the Madrid Protocol, the Environmental Evaluation Group (GAAm) of the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR)  was created, on the 22nd  of August, 1994, with the following tasks:

- To evaluate: scientific research activities, operational and logistic support activities, tourism or any other governmental or nongovernmental activities (in order to limit the environmental damage impact in the Antarctic and its dependent and related ecosystems);

- To conduct preliminary assessment and to produce Initial and Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations reports of the research activities proposed, and of any others that could be developed in the Antarctic;

- To appoint ways to prevent or minimize environmental impacts caused by human activities in the Antarctic;

- To suggest modifications, interruptions or cancellations of activities which cause or threat to cause damage to the antarctic environment or its dependent and related ecosystems;

- To estabilish environmental monitor system for the Antarctic, its ecosystem and associated activities;

- To suggest the necessary behaviour in cases that require an urgent answer, including preventive or emergency action concerning environmental protection; and

- Brazilian Antarctic Program                                              1
- To identify the need to develop studies and research to acquire knowledge about the antarctic environment, associated with the tasks of the GAAm.

The Environment Evaluation Group (GAAm), initiating its work, produced the preliminary version of the "Guide to Environment Impact Assessment for Projects and Activities in the Antarctic", in February 1996.

Another important factor, connected with the environmental theme, was the beginning of the survey of the biological occurrences, considered important in the Admiralty Bay area, in order to carry out  the Site Inventory, necessary for the management of the Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) that will be created.
