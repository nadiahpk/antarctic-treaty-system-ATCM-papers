OPENING ADDRESS BY DR MIKE RICHARDSON,

HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM

Mr Chairman,

May I, on behalf of the UK delegation, thank the Government of The Netherlands for hosting this XXth ATCM in this ancient city of Utrecht. Under your Chairmanship we are assured of constructive discussions to work towards the priority goal of ratification of the Environmental Protocol.

We extend congratulations towards the six States that have ratified the Protocol since the last ATCM. For the first time since 1991 we can begin to see that the Protocol may indeed come into force before too long. We would urge the remaining four States that have not yet ratified to do all in their power to do so at the earliest opportunity.

The ATCM is, we believe, facing a temporary difficulty. A degree of inertia has set in with clear directions forward not always apparent. Much of this can be laid at the door of the interim period in which we find ourselves ahead of ratification. We believe that the coming into being of the Committee for Environmental Protection, required by the Protocol, should re-inject vigour back into the system. There are fundamental environmental concerns that require to be addressed in Antarctica. The CEP will play a key role in advising on those issues.

To ensure that the CEP is effective on ratification we must lay adequate foundations now. The precursor of the CEP, the Transitional Environmental Working Group must, on the one hand, be given a focused limited agenda of key issues, whilst on the other hand, be allowed freer rein to adopt a more pro-active approach to environmental advice. It ought not to be constrained to a reactive position of only providing advice when requested to do so by the ATCM.

We will present a paper on the timing of the ATCM. We are concerned that the ATCM should meet as early as possible in the year to provide for adequate preparatory time for the activities proposed for the following year. But it should also meet late enough to allow sufficient time for preparation of papers reporting the activities of the previous year. For that reason the UK believes
that ATCMs should continue to be held in April/May.

We note the considerable work that has been done by the Experts Group 
on liability. But progress has been slow on this complex but important subject. 
We intend to continue to play an active role in the discussions on an Annex on 
Liability. Our view is that any liability regime must be realistic, tailored to the 
specific and difficult conditions of Antarctica and, importantly, that it must not 
jeopardise science programmes.

● The United Kingdom delegation looks forward to a profitable and 
productive meeting under your Chairmanship.
