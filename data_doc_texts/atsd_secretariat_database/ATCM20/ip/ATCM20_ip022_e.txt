ANTARCTIC OZONE - CURRENT STATUS REPORT

Introduction

Ozone, a naturally occurring gas, is vital to life on Earth
because it protects it from ultra-violet radiation from the sun.
It is also a strong greenhouse gas. Ozone exists throughout the
atmosphere but mostly in the layer between 10 and 50 kilometres
in altitude - the stratosphere.

2. Ozone is decreasing over most of the world, but the greatest
decrease by far occurs over Antarctica each year during spring.
This is caused by components of synthetic substances which result
from human activity, mostly in the northern hemisphere, and
eventually reach the stratosphere. In the Antarctic, a unique
and complex set of circumstances combine, when sunlight returns
after the polar winter, to destroy almost all of the ozone
between about 13 and 20kms, which we now know has occurred since at least the early 1980s
(see Figure). The hole peaks in severity early in October by
which time chemical destruction of ozone has ceased. Next,
invasion of ozone rich air into the polar stratosphere causes
ozone values to rise and by late December, ozone over Antarctica
has returned to more normal values.

The 1995 Ozone Hole
3. The 1995 hole was similar to the severe ones of recent years
with ozone dropping to about one third of pre 1980s values. The
maximum area was about 22 million square kilometres compared with
24 million square kilometres for 1994 (Europe covers about 9
million square kilometres). An interesting feature of the 1995
event was its persistence. The decay of the hole is
significantly affected by stratospheric circulation patterns but
is generally well advanced by the start of December. In 1995 the
hole eroded very slowly and persisted well into December.

The Future
4. Observations from several global monitoring networks have
shown declining growth rates of the major ozone depleting
substances. Their emissions are largely controlled by
international agreements and global data indicate that these are
having a very significant effect: chlorine in the lower
atmosphere peaked in 1994 and, in the stratosphere, its
concentration will peak towards the end of this decade. Thus,
the Antarctic ozone hole is not expected to significantly deepen
and, in the long term (over the next 20-30 years), it is expected
to become less severe. However, as other factors, also determine
the extent, depth and persistence of the hole each year, it is
not possible to accurately predict its year-by-year behaviour.

5. International research is continuing to increase our

understanding of the processes that control ozone. This, 
together with improved observational capability using satellites 
is helping to lessen the effects of data sparseness, especially 
in the southern hemisphere. This will help improve global models 
and operational analysis and prediction of ozone behaviour.

6. Observations are essential to satisfactorily define the 
distribution of ozone in the vertical as well as the horizontal. 
A crucial factor is the availability of routine measurements from 
a network of ozone sonde stations. In addition to their role in 
validation and calibration of satellite retrievals, in situ 
measurement is the only way, at present, for measuring ozone 
concentration in the lower levels of the stratosphere, where the 
largest global-scale trends in ozone are being observed. Ozone 
is also a major greenhouse gas and its three dimensional 
distribution is a very important input for models which predict 
trends in global warming. The Sub Antarctic islands have been 
identified as ideal locations for ozone sonde releases and 
efforts should be made to establish observing systems on some of 
these.

within it since 1978. The main feature is the, on average, 
increase in area and decrease in minimum value, especially 
between 1980 and 1992.
