MISSION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

The mission which the South African National Antarctic Programme endeavours to achieve in all its activities is as follows:

"It is our mission to protect the Antarctic Environment, its dependant and associated ecosystems, its intrinsic and aesthetic value as a wilderness, and its value as an area for conducting scientific research, in particular research with respect to the global environment."

(Adapted from the Madrid Protocol of October 1991)

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY
