REPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANISATION (IHO)
TO THE XX ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING (ATCM),
UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS, 29 APRIL - 10 MAY 1996

                                  [Submitted by the IHO]
REPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANISATION (IHO) TO THE
XX ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING (ATCM), UTRECHT, THE
NETHERLANDS, 29 APRIL - 10 MAY 1996

1.    Background - Summary

The International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO)'s Permanent Working Group (PWG) on
Cooperation in Antarctica was established in 1992 and has rendered previous reports to ATCM. This
report serves to update developments since the last report rendered to the 1995 meeting in Seoul. The
report is presented to ATCM in Utrecht on behalf of the IHO by the Netherlands' Hydrographer,
Commodore Egon Bakker.

2.    Progress Report 1995-1996

2.1   During the past twelve months the Member States of the IHO which belong to the PWG have
proceeded to consolidate their work in the production of nautical charts of Antarctica. INT chart 65
has been produced by New Zealand and reproduced by the United Kingdom. INT chart 9154, which
has been a collaborative production between Argentina and the United Kingdom, was produced in
February 1996. Additionally, 20 charts are scheduled for completion later in 1996 or 1997. A further
11 charts are presently scheduled for production in the period 1998-2000. The two graphic indexes
accompanying this Report show the configuration of the INT chart scheme, the production
responsibilities of the individual Member States, and the scheduled publication dates.

2.2   It will be appreciated that scheduled completion of the INT charts is dependent on the timely
and successful completion of the surveys, which are influenced by factors outside the control of the
responsible national hydrographic offices, not least budgetary and meteorological factors.
Notwithstanding these, IHO Member States are making every effort to complete their survey
undertakings and to process the results of those surveys promptly for subsequent incorporation into
the charts.

2.3   IHO Member States continue to cooperate bilaterally to avoid duplication of survey work and
to ensure the maximum return on the investment of scarce and expensive surveying resources in
Antarctica.

2.4   Production of the nautical chart programme has also benefitted from the inclusion of data held
in the IHO's Data Centre for Digital Bathymetry (DCDB) at Boulder, Colorado, USA. The Centre
receives data from a multiplicity of scientific institutes and organisations. Whilst much of the data
held by DCDB has not been collected primarily for navigational purposes, Member States find that
it can have considerable value as source data in the production of nautical charts, provided that it is
carefully quality assessed.

2.5   The progress of chart production to date has been hallmarked by the degree to which Member
States have been prepared to exchange national data sets and collaborate in compilation. The IHO
recognises the high professional commitment of these Member States: Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Chile, Ecuador, France, Russia, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay, and
the extent of the collaboration of their Hydrographic Services in the production of the INT chart
scheme of Antarctica which will contribute to the safety of life at sea in those waters.
3.    Cooperation with other international organisations

The IHO continues to cooperate closely with SCAR and COMNAP, in particular, and welcomes the presence of observers from these organisations at the biennial meetings of the PWGCA. IHO is aware of the year-on-year increase of maritime traffic in Antarctica, and the extent to which this highlights the need for up-to-date, official nautical charts to enhance the safety of Antarctic navigation. However, IHO wishes to register with ATCM its concern that Antarctic waters continue to be amongst the most treacherous in the world, and the navigators of tourist ships in particular should be cautioned that nautical charts of Antarctica are not as complete as charts in other parts of the world because of the sever difficulties of thoroughly and consistently surveying in such difficult operating conditions. It is for this reason that IHO has sought to establish a link with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) and has sought to encourage the supply of additional information in the form of comments on existing charts, graphical information etc to enhance the currency and accuracy of chart detail.

4.    Conclusion

The IHO is pleased to be able to assure the ATCM that its Member States involved in the work of the PWG will continue their high level of commitment to the work of surveying and charting Antarctic waters within the constraints of their scarce national surveying and charting resources. In turn, the IHO Member States look to ATCM for positive action in support of the Seoul resolution 1-1995 with respect to the continuing funding of these important activities (within the National Antarctic Programmes) to support the safety of life at sea in Antarctica.
