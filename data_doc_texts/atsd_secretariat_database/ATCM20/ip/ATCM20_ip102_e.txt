(Submitted by the United States)

This information paper reports progress over the past two 
Antarctic Peninsula field seasons of a pilot study, described in 
XIX ATCM/INF 47, to determine whether tour vessels and other 
platforms-of-opportunity might provide a cost-effective means to 
characterize and detect visitor-caused changes in the flora, 
fauna, and other features at sites along the Antarctic 
Peninsula, particularly those subjected to frequent annual 
visits by tourists.

BACKGROUND

When it enters into force, the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the "Protocol") will require 
that environmental impact assessments be done routinely during 
the planning of all activities to be conducted in Antarctica and 
that monitoring be done, as and when necessary, to ensure that 
activities conducted in Antarctica do not have unacceptable 
environmental impacts. The provisions of the Protocol will apply 
to tourism and other non-governmental, as well as governmental, 
activities.

Available information is insufficient to accurately assess 
how tourism and other non-governmental activities may affect the 
Antarctic environment. Effects will depend on a number of 
variables, including the physical and biological features of the 
sites visited, the frequency and timing of visits, the number of 
visitors, and what visitors do while on site.

It would be prohibitively costly, if not impossible, to 
assess and monitor every feature at every site that might be 
impacted by tourism and other non-governmental activities in the 
Antarctic. Therefore, effective implementation of the Protocol, 
as it applies to tourism and non-governmental activities, will 
require development of cost-effective methods for assessing,
 
1
monitoring to detect, and determining how best to prevent or mitigate the possible adverse impacts of tourism and other non-governmental activities on physical features and biota that may be particularly sensitive to disturbance.

OBJECTIVES

The principal objectives of the Antarctic Site Inventory are:
· to determine whether periodic short visits by trained investigators transported by tourist expedition vessels and other platforms-of-opportunity might provide a cost-effective means to characterize and detect changes in the flora, fauna, and other features of Antarctic Peninsula sites subject to frequent visits by tourists; and
· to begin compiling baseline data and information necessary to assess and determine how best to minimize the environmental impacts of tourism and non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Peninsula area.

The results of this pilot study will help design cost-effective research and monitoring programs to assure that tourism and other non-governmental activities do not harm the Antarctic environment.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA

Shipboard tourists have been coming to Antarctica for more than 25 years, with the Antarctic Peninsula being a choice locale. It has many attractions for austral summer visitors: boundless volcanic, mountainous, and glacial scenery; an abundance of fauna (five species of seals, up to five species of breeding penguins, and a wide range of flying birds); and numerous historic sites. During the 1995-96 austral summer, the Office of Polar Programs of the US National Science Foundation ("NSF/OPP") estimated that there would be more than 110 shipboard departures to Antarctica, involving more than 9,000 tourists. The Antarctic Peninsula, which is the focus of the Antarctic Site Inventory project, is the most frequently visited area of the continent and is where more than 90% of the tourist

2
visits during the 1995-96 season were expected to take place.
According to NSF/OPP statistics, more than 115 different
Antarctic Peninsula sites have been visited since 1990. During
the 1994-95 austral summer, five of these sites received more
than 3,000 visitors, nine received between 1,000-3,000 visitors,
11 received between 500-1,000 visitors, and 17 sites received
between 250-500 visitors.

METHODS

Composition of research teams. The project uses two, two-
person teams working simultaneously on different platforms at
selected, pre-determined times during each Antarctic Peninsula
field season. The principal investigator heads one of the teams,
and an investigator with experience on the project is chosen to
head the second team. All vessels do not visit the same sites
and working simultaneously from different platforms allows more
locations to be visited. Working in teams also allows better
coverage of sites where there are great distances to cover; i.e.
the investigators work in different directions and stay in radio
communication at all times.

Vessel selection. At least six months prior to the start of
the field season, the principal investigator contacts many of
the companies operating expedition tour vessels in the
Peninsula, to obtain schedules for the upcoming austral summer
season and to begin discussions about the possibility of
transporting project investigators to visitor sites. The
principal investigator negotiates arrangements to pay for the
investigators' room, board, and other costs, which vary from
company to company and ship to ship. Care is taken to select
vessels and expedition leaders whose programs envisage 2-3
landings per day over a 5-7 day itinerary, and to fashion
schedules that allow project investigators a minimum of 3-5
hours ashore during each landing. As possible, arrangements are
made to carry the two-person field teams ashore in scout boats
well in advance of any other visitors. Often, additional
arrangements are made to transport investigators by zodiac to
other nearby survey sites, even though those sites aren't the
primary focus of that day's landing or series of landings.

3
Site selection. The goal is to insure that project 
investigators, over the course of an entire field season, are 
able to make regular visits to as many Peninsula locations as 
possible, especially those sites receiving the most visitor 
traffic. This requires placing the project's two, two-person 
teams aboard vessels that have the most numbers of landings per 
day and the longest itineraries. During the course of the 
expedition, the head of each field team closely coordinates with 
the expedition leader and captain on schedule changes that may 
be required because of weather or other circumstances, and 
consults about additional landings that might be accomplished.

Timing of visits. When making arrangements with the tour 
operators, the principal investigator attempts to schedule 
placement of field teams at specific times for collecting 
biological data of particular relevance to the project. These 
key times are: from the beginning of November to early December, 
when penguin egg-laying is at its peak; and mid-January to mid-
February, when penguin chick-creching is at its peak, southern 
fur seals begin to haul-out on Peninsula beaches, and southern 
elephant seals collect in wallows to molt. Below, the earlier 
November-December period is referred to as the "1st Deployment" 
and the later January-February period as the "2nd Deployment."

Data and information collected at each site. Three broad 
categories of data and information are being collected. The 
first, Basic Site Information, includes descriptions of key 
physical and topographical characteristics of the site; the 
latitude and longitude of the site; the locations of floral 
assemblages (lichens, mosses, and grass), haul-out sites and 
wallow areas of Antarctic seals, discrete groups of breeding 
penguins and flying birds, penguin molting areas, and guano-melt 
streams; glacial-melt streams; and how the site is accessed and 
exited.

The second information category, Variable Site Information 
and Data, includes information and data concerning weather and 
other environmental conditions (sea ice extent, cloud cover, 
snow cover, temperature, wind direction and speed); particular 
biological variables relating to penguins and flying birds 
(numbers of adults or individual animals, active nests, numbers 
4
and ages of chicks); and the nature and extent of any visitor 
impacts that may be observed (footprints or paths through moss 
beds, cigarette butts, film canisters, and for example, other 
litter).

    At each site, investigators attempt to select and establish 
control (seldom disturbed) colonies and experimental (frequently 
disturbed) colonies to census. The intent is to regularly repeat 
censuses both near and far from landing beaches where visitors 
access a particular location, to allow comparisons, over time, 
between areas where there is comparatively much and little human 
activity. As standard practice, investigators count all seals at 
the landing beaches of all survey sites visited, and all 
southern elephant seal wallows that are found.

    The Variable Site Information and Data are collected 
according to the methods described in the CEMP Standard Methods 
for Monitoring Studies written by the Scientific Committee for 
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (November 
1992) and other pertinent authorities, in particular, J. P. 
Croxall & E. D. Kirkwood, The Distribution of Penguins on the 
Antarctic Peninsula and Islands of the Scotia Sea (1979) and E. 
J. Woehler, The Distribution and Abundance of Antarctic and 
Subantarctic Penguins (1993). The principal investigator keeps 
informed of changes made to the CEMP Standard Methods. The 
parameters relating to the breeding chronologies of penguins and 
flying birds to be monitored are chosen with reference to these 
standard methods, and in consultation with the project's science 
advisory board.

    The third information category is Maps and 
Photodocumentation. The project intends to produce accurate up-
to-date maps of each site. These will show the major physical 
features of each site, the locations of the principal colonies 
and assemblages of fauna and flora at each site, and points that 
offer clear vantage for viewing and photographing particular 
penguin colonies, seal haul-out sites, floral associations, and 
other features. It is intended that maps will be updated and 
upgraded during and after each field season. A preliminary map 
of the visitor site at the Aitcho Islands, drawn during the 
1995-96 field season, is attached. Project investigators use 
5
35mm cameras to take repetitive photographs - within a season 
and from season-to-season, and from the same vantage points - of 
flora (lichen, mosses, and grass), penguin and seabird colonies, 
seal haul-out sites, and other features, which over time might 
document on-site changes. The maps and photographic slides are 
digitized and archived.

Some of the photographic vantage points and some of the 
discrete groups of fauna and flora are marked by wooden stakes 
to insure that they can be relocated and censused from the same 
perspective during future visits. The stakes bear numbered tags 
that are referenced on the project's maps.

Over time, by using both the Basic Site Information and the 
Variable Site Information and Data, project investigators expect 
to be able to establish geological, glacial, and floral profiles 
of each site, and develop baselines concerning the numbers and 
breeding chronologies of penguins and flying birds nesting at 
each site.

Data collection procedures. Data and information are 
collected according to the following procedures:

  Prior to the start of each site survey, the investigators:
• Record the ship's GPS reading, and compare it to that 
  obtained from the team's hand-held GPS receivers;
• Record Beaufort wind force, air and water temperatures 
  in °C., and the amount of ice and cloud cover; and
• Photograph the landing site, from port to starboard, 
  and record bearings and distances from the ship to 
  prominent features and landmarks on shore.

Immediately upon reaching the landing site, the 
investigators:
• Record the GPS reading and, if necessary, find a safe 
  location for placing the GPS base unit;
• Take additional photographs if necessary, and estimate 
  the dimensions of the landing beach and record any 
  other prominent features or landmarks; and

6
•    Take and record compass bearings and 
measure/estimate/record distances from the landing 
beach to prominent features and to discrete groups or 
assemblages of fauna and flora.

While ashore, the investigators:

•    Use hand-held GPS receivers to document waypoints as 
necessary for general surveying and mapping purposes, 
and to specifically record the positions of prominent 
features and discrete groups or assemblages of fauna 
and flora;

•    Determine/identify other access and exit points to the 
landing site, and describe groups or assemblages of 
fauna and flora in close proximity to all access and 
exit points;

•    Establish a route for censusing seals that may be 
present;

•    Locate vantage points from which serial, visit-to-
visit and season-to-season photodocumentation and 
observation of prominent features and discrete groups 
or assemblages of fauna and flora can be accomplished;

•    Maintain a running log of the date and the location 
where each photograph is taken, and as appropriate 
photograph discrete groups of penguins, flying birds, 
seals (wallows or haul-out sites), and floral 
assemblages that are easily reached by visitors from 
the landing sites, and those which are difficult or 
impossible to reach in the normal course of a visitor 
landing and which, therefore, may serve as "control 
groups";

•    With respect to selected control and experimental 
groups of penguins and flying birds (and according to 
the stage of the breeding cycle), record and estimate: 
the number of active nests; the number of adults 
present (whether incubating or not); the number of 
eggs and eggs per nest (as possible); the number of 
chicks (and chicks per nest, as possible); the age of 
chicks 
7
chicks (in weeks); and with respect to penguins, the percentage of chicks that are creched; and

•    With respect to seals, record the number, age, condition, and location of seals in wallows and hauled-out on beaches.

Following each site survey, the investigators:

•    Log field data onto standard data sheets, and update the master film log; data sheets are duplicated and the originals are stored for safe-keeping;

•    Review data to insure that each team member is cognizant of the other's effort and coverage, and compare maps and sketches to insure accuracy and agreement; and

•    Determine data collection priorities for the next visit to the site.

International cooperation. To avoid duplication of effort, the principal investigator coordinates with other national Antarctic programs and their scientists, and with representatives of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and its specialist groups, regarding ongoing and previous scientific effort that relates directly to sites being surveyed. At sites where on-site flora have been photographed, identification of such flora is made in coordination with British Antarctic Survey personnel. Similarly, there is coordination with British Antarctic Survey geologists, as well as with present and former US Antarctic Program geologists, to insure that geological profiles of each survey site are added to the Inventory.

Science advisory board. An advisory board of US and other international Antarctic scientists has been established to provide advice on the proper analysis and dissemination of data and information collected for the project, and the utility of the database being developed.

Data analysis. At the end of each field season, the principal investigator reviews the data to ascertain which sites were visited and how often they were visited, and whether sites were

8
visited in both the 1st and 2nd deployments. These summary data 
are reviewed in turn to evaluate whether the selection of 
vessels and expedition leaders produced the desired coverage of 
sites for the season, and to make necessary scheduling 
adjustments for the next field season. The costs of maintaining 
project investigators on board these vessels are compared to the 
resulting data to determine whether the arrangements provided a 
cost-effective means for obtaining data.

The principal investigator also reviews and analyzes the data 
sheets from every site visit to insure that data have been 
collected consistently and recorded accurately. The principal 
investigator logs the data from the data sheets onto computer, 
the results and summaries of which are analyzed and discussed 
with the project's science advisory board and scientists from 
other national Antarctic programs. Consultations with these 
scientists are intended to insure that, over time, the project 
focuses on the indicator variables most likely to be sensitive 
to human disturbance. The principal investigator will update 
site maps to incorporate data collected in 1995-96, and before 
the next field season will update the field manual to guide the 
project's investigators.

RESULTS

  Survey sites. In two seasons, there were a total of 157 
survey visits to 47 different sites. At these 47 sites, 299 
locations have been established for conducting repetitive, in-
season and season-to-season, censuses of penguins flying birds, 
and seals; and 60 of these 299 locations have been selected and 
established as potential "control sites" to allow comparisons 
between visited colonies and non-visited colonies over time.

  During the 1994-95 field season, only one two-person research 
team was used. The team conducted 43 visits to 20 sites. Five 
days of early season survey work (in November) were lost due to 
bad weather and logistics problems. In the 1995-96 field season, 
two, two-person research teams were used at all key times. There 
were no weather or logistics difficulties and these two survey 
teams conducted 114 visits to 44 sites. A table summarizing the
9
sites visited, the number of visits to each site, and what was 
done at each site is attached.

Expedition vessels and other platforms-of-opportunity. The 
three expedition ships utilized for Inventory work in 1994-95 
were: MV EXPLORER, MV ALLA TARASOVA, and the MV LIVONIA. The 
three expedition ships utilized in 1995-96 were: MV EXPLORER, MV 
WORLD DISCOVERER, and the MV LIVONIA. As requested, Inventory 
investigators were given the maximum possible amounts of time at 
landing sites and were "put in" before any other visitors came 
ashore.

In addition, in 1995-96, through specific coordination with 
the Polar Regions Section, South Atlantic and Antarctic 
Department, UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Inventory 
investigators began a cooperative program with HMS ENDURANCE, 
the British Royal Navy ice patrol ship, primarily to obtain 
oblique aerial photodocumentation of project survey sites. A 
small number of ground-surveys also were done in conjunction 
with this aerial work. (The cooperative program with HMS 
ENDURANCE is described more completely in the XXth ATCM 
Information Paper: PHOTODOCUMENTATION OF SURVEY SITES: REPORT OF 
A COOPERATIVE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM DURING THE 1995-96 AUSTRAL 
SUMMER.) The following table summarizes the work accomplished 
during the 1995-96 field season:

Feasibility. A principal objective of the project is to 
determine whether tourist expedition vessels and other 
platforms-of-opportunity might provide a cost-effective means to 
characterize and detect changes in the flora, fauna, and other 
features of Antarctic Peninsula sites subject to frequent visits 
by tourists. Upgrading to two, two-person research teams enabled 
the project to cover more sites in the 1995-96 season. The 
following table summarizes the project's success in reaching 
intended locations regularly within a field season, and from the 
first field season to the second:

The 47 sites that have been surveyed included 27 of the 29 
locations in the Antarctic Peninsula most frequently visited by 
tourists in the 1994-95 austral summer,1 the two exceptions 
being the Marsh and Bellingshausen Stations in Maxwell Bay where 
there are no wildlife colonies in the immediate vicinity. The 47 
survey sites also included all but four of the 35 sites that 
received more than 250 visitors in the 1994-95 austral summer,2 
the two additional exceptions being Shingle Cove on Coronation 
Island and the Riser-Larsen Ice shelf in Queen Maud Land. These 
35 sites are the ones likely to generate the most attention - 
and possibly concern about potential adverse environmental 
effects - when the Protocol enters into force.

Photodocumentation. The following table summarizes the 
photodocumentary aspects of the project over two seasons of

PLANS FOR THE 1996-97 FIELD SEASON

The project's third field season is expected to begin in 
November 1996 and continue through mid-February 1997, once again 
utilizing two, two-person research teams. Negotiations regarding 
work schedules have begun with several expedition companies, and 
it is hoped that cooperative efforts with HMS ENDURANCE will 
continue. The main priorities will be returning to previously 
visited survey sites, particularly those where prospective 
control colonies have been established, and to upgrading site 
sketches and maps.
