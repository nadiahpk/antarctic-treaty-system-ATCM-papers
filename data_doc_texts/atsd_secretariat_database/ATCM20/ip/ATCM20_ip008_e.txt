A REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (EIAs)              
PREPARED FOR PROPOSED ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA              

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)
A REVIEW OF
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (EIAs)
PREPARED FOR PROPOSED ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA

1.      INTRODUCTION

The UK has produced a review of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) prepared
for proposed activities in Antarctica for the XVIII ATCM (XVIII ATCM/INFO 9).
This review was updated for the XIX ATCM (XIX ATCM/INFO 15). This paper
updates the review again, and examines Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs) and
Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs) which have been published,
circulated or made available up to the end of December 1995.

2.      METHODS

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has established a library of EIAs, both of IEEs
and CEEs, produced since 1987 for proposed activities in Antarctica. For each EIA
a summary was produced and each summary was then analyzed for the review. The
details recorded for each EIA were:

-       Date of EIA (year)
-       Type of EIA (IEE, draft CEE, final CEE)
-       Category of activity
-       Location of activity (Latitude, Longitude)
-       Title of EIA
-       Author(s), if known
-       Organisation responsible
-       ATCP responsible, if relevant.

3.      RESULTS

A total of 58 EIAs have so far been released. Of these, 46 were IEEs (Table 1), 5
were draft CEEs and 5 were final CEEs (Table 2). Map 1 shows the locations of
activities where IEEs have been carried out and Map 2 shows the locations of
activities for which draft and final CEEs have been carried out.

The study shows that since the adoption of the Environmental Protocol in 1991, the
number of EIAs released per annum has steadily increased from 8 in 1991 to a
maximum of 15 in 1993 (Figure 1). The totals for 1994 and 1995 appear low, and are
thought to be incomplete.

A detailed breakdown of the main categories of the proposed activities evaluated by
the EIAs is given in Table 3. Considering all EIAs together, the most common
category of activity assessed was the construction of a station facility. A total of 23
EIAs (all IEEs) were recorded in this category; approximately 40% of all EIAs
analysed. This was followed by EIAs prepared for the construction, operation or
rebuild of a research station (7 EIAs - 4 IEEs, 2 draft CEEs, 1 final CEE).

Most EIAs were carried out for activities proposed in coastal ice-free areas (Table 4).
A total of 28 EIAs (24 IEEs, 1 draft CEE, 1 final CEE) were placed in this category; 
48% of all EIAs analysed. Most EIAs in the top category were for proposed activities 
at research stations, with the highest numbers carried out at Davis (Australia) (7 IEEs), 
McMurdo (US) (6 IEEs) and Mawson (Australia) (3 IEEs).

National Antarctic operators have written the vast majority of EIAs (Table 5). A total 
of 43 EIAs were in this category (37 IEEs, 2 draft CEEs, 4 final CEEs); 74% of all 
EIAs examined. Only 7 EIAs (all IEEs) have been prepared by non-governmental 
organisations. Of these, 2 were prepared by Greenpeace International, 4 for, or by, 
tour operators and one by a private company. The release of EIAs by tour operators 
continues. This is welcome, as some now organise significant logistical programmes, 
often involving large ice-strengthened vessels and dedicated aircraft.

Of the existing 26 Consultative Parties, 14 have been either wholly or partly 
responsible for at least one EIA (Table 6). To date, Australia has produced the highest 
number of EIAs (17 IEEs), followed by the USA (13 IEEs). A total of 5 EIAs (3 
IEEs, 2 final CEEs) have been prepared jointly by two Consultative Parties.

4.    DISCUSSION

It is difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of how EIA is operating in 
Antarctica as information on EIAs, particularly IEEs, is not widely available. To try 
and overcome this problem Resolution 6 was agreed at the XIX ATCM. This requires 
each of the Consultative Parties to provide a list of the IEEs and CEEs submitted to 
them during the preceding calendar year to the host Government of the ATCM. It is 
hoped that the collation of these lists will improve the exchange of information on 
EIA in Antarctica and help to monitor the scale and trend of activities and 
developments in Antarctica.

1       If an EIA is written by one party it scores 1 point.
        If an EIA is written jointly by two parties each receives 0.5 points.
2       Germany prepared 2 IEEs jointly, one with Chile and the other with Argentina.
3       Netherlands produced 1 IEE jointly with Argentina.
4       France prepared 2 final CEEs jointly with Italy.
