STATEMENT BY THE CCAMLR OBSERVER AT THE XXth ATCM

CCAMLR is pleased to attend the XXth ATCM and welcomes the opportunity to inform
Consultative Parties of recent developments in its work.

2.      CCAMLR continues to be very active in the conservation and rational utilisation of
Antarctic marine living resources. In the 1994/95 season one workshop, two ad hoc
subgroups, two working groups, the Scientific Committee and the Commission all met to
consider various aspects of resource conservation and management.

MEMBERSHIP

3.      Since the XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting there have been no changes in the
CCAMLR membership. A list of current CCAMLR Members and Acceding States is attached
(Appendix A).

FISHING IN THE CONVENTION AREA IN THE 1994/95 AND 1995/96 SEASONS

4.      Fisheries for Antarctic krill, several species of finfish and Antarctic crabs were open in
the CCAMLR Convention Area in the 1994/95 season. A map of the CCAMLR Convention Area
is attached (Appendix B).

5.      For the first time since 1992, krill catches increased in 1994/95 to a total of
118 715 tonnes as a result of increased fishing, mostly in Subareas 48.2 and 48.3, by
Ukraine. Other countries which fished for krill were Japan and Poland.

6.      The major finfish species targeted in commercial fisheries in the 1994/95 season was the
Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Fishing for D. eleginoides was conducted in
Subarea 48.3 (South Georgia Island), Division 58.5.1 (Kerguelen Islands) and Division 58.5.2
(McDonald and Heard Islands). The total catch of this species was 8 889 tonnes from both
longline and trawl fisheries.

7.      Although the fisheries for mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), grey rockcod
(Lepidonotothen squamifrons) and crabs (Paralomis spinosissima and P.formosa) were open
in some areas and seasons, no catches were reported from these particular fisheries.
8. The following fisheries are open in the 1995/96 season in the Convention Area and are subject to allocated Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and other fisheries regulations:

| Species          | Area                                 | TAC (tonnes) |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| Antarctic krill  | 48       (South Atlantic)            | 1 500 000    |
|                  | 58.4.2   (South Indian Ocean)        | 450 000      |
| Patagonian toothfish | 48.3     (South Georgia and Shag Rocks) | 4 000        |
|                  | 48.4     (South Sandwich Islands)    | 28           |
|                  | 58.4.3   (Elan and Banzare Banks)    | 200          |
|                  | 58.5.2   (McDonald and Heard Islands) | 297          |
| Mackerel icefish | 48.3     (South Georgia and Shag Rocks) | 1 000        |
|                  | 58.5.2   (McDonald and Heard Islands) | 311          |
| Grey rockcod     | 58.4.4   (Ob and Lena banks)         | 1 150        |
| Lanternfish      | 48.3     (South Georgia and Shag Rocks) | 109 000      |
| Antarctic crabs  | 48.3     (South Georgia and Shag Rocks) | 1 600        |

9. The following TACs have been re-assessed since last season:

- Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in Division 58.4.2, for which the TAC was adjusted in line with new calculations, and is now set at 450 000 tonnes (previously 390 000 tonnes);
- Lanternfish (Electrona carlsbergi) in Subarea 48.3, for which the TAC was reduced this year from 200 000 to 109 000 tonnes to reflect increasing uncertainty about the state of this stock in the absence of fishing and new research surveys; and
- Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) in Subarea 48.3, for which the TAC has been increased to 4 000 tonnes (previously 2 800 tonnes) in line with new calculations based on results of scientific surveys.

10. In addition, some small TACs were allocated to the following fisheries:

- Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in Subarea 48.3, for which a restricted (1 000 tonnes) commercial catch taken with midwater trawls is allowed, but linked to a requirement to perform a bottom trawl survey;
- an exploratory fishery for toothfish species in Division 58.4.3 (Elan and Banzare Banks) with a TAC of 200 tonnes; and
- an exploratory fishery for deep-water species around Heard Island (Division 58.5.2) with a TAC of 50 tonnes for each species.

2
11. The 1995/96 Schedule of CCAMLR Conservation Measures contains 35 conservation measures which regulate fisheries activities of CCAMLR Members and require comprehensive, detailed data collection and reporting from fisheries.

THE SCIENCE OF ANTARCTIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

12. Calculations made last year established that the best estimate of potential yield for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba ) was 0.116 of its pre-exploitation biomass. This figure was obtained from modelling exercises which take into account the risk of depletion of the krill stock (the 'risk' is a 10% probability that the spawning stock biomass will drop below 20% of its median unexploited level over a period of 20 years) and the risk that dependent species (such as penguins and seals) would experience an unacceptable decline in their krill food source.

13. This year the precautionary krill catch limit for Division 58.4.2 (South Indian Ocean) was adjusted in line with the new calculations. The estimate of pre-exploitation biomass for this division is 3.9 million tonnes.

14. A new estimate (35.4 million tonnes) has been calculated for pre-exploitation biomass for Area 48. However further evidence suggests that there may have been changes in the pattern of krill recruitment in Area 48 in recent years. Revision of the precautionary catch limit for krill in Area 48 has been deferred, pending investigation of this possibility.

15. The Workshop on Methods for the Assessment of Patagonian toothfish resulted in greatly improved assessments of this species. The new assessment for Subarea 48.3 used results from scientific surveys and, taking uncertainty into account, calculated a long-term low-risk annual yield of 4 000 tonnes.

16. At the first meeting of the new CCAMLR Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM) in Siena, Italy, a major breakthrough was achieved towards integration of the ecosystem approach into CCAMLR's management advice. As a first step in this process the Working Group constructed a framework for a strategic model which will allow information collected from the now well-established CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program to be integrated into an 'ecosystem assessment'.
CCAMLR SCHEME OF INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION

17. The Scheme of International Scientific Observation has been in force since the 1992/93 season.

18  For the last three fishing seasons, every vessel taking part in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in Subarea 48.3 was obliged to have an international scientific observer on board. Scientific observers designated under the Scheme conducted observations aboard each of the 13 vessels fishing for D. eleginoides in the 1994/95 season in Subarea 48.3.

19. The quantity and quality of data deriving from this scheme was extremely high, and enabled stock assessments of this species to be developed considerably. The data also proved particularly useful in assessing the effectiveness of the measures taken to mitigate seabird by-catch in this longline fishery.

20. A scientific observer designated by the USA conducted an observation program aboard the Japanese vessel Chiyo Maru No. 2 fishing for krill in Statistical Area 58. In addition, scientific observers from Ukraine were placed on board two krill trawlers as part of the Ukrainian national research program.

21. A scientific observers' logbook for recording scientific observations conducted on board of longline fishing vessels was prepared and published by CCAMLR. There are plans to produce similar logbooks for other types of fisheries. The scientific observers' manual has been revised and a new version of this manual will be published next year.

PREVENTION OF INCIDENTAL MORTALITY OF SEABIRDS DURING FISHING OPERATIONS

22. Detailed analysis of data collected by CCAMLR scientific observers revealed that there was a general decrease in the overall catch rate of birds in the longline fishery in 1995, probably due to the implementation of CCAMLR requirements such as night-time setting of longlines and the use of bird-scaring streamer lines.

23. The Conservation Measure designed to minimise incidental mortality has been amended so that if discharge of offal during setting or hauling is unavoidable, this must now take place from the side opposite that on which longlines are deployed. Guidelines are also given on the size and spacing of weights on the line to ensure that it sinks as fast as possible. These two additions should reduce the opportunities for birds to take bait and thus be caught on longlines.

4
24. An information document "CCAMLR Initiatives on the Prevention of Incidental Mortality 
of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries" was prepared and distributed in 1995 to many international 
organisations having an interest in the reduction of seabird mortality in fisheries.

25. The CCAMLR Co-ordinating Group on the incidental mortality of seabirds arising from 
longline fisheries continues its work intersessionally. A handbook advising fishermen about 
seabirds, their interaction with longline fisheries and methods of preventing seabirds mortality, 
is in preparation. It will be published later this year.

MARINE DEBRIS

26. This year's reports from Members on the assessment and avoidance of incidental 
mortality and the impacts of marine debris on biota in the Convention Area have shown a 
continued reduction in the overall amount of marine debris at some locations of the Atlantic 
sector of the Southern Ocean. This suggests that compliance with CCAMLR measures designed 
to reduce marine debris has improved. Unfortunately, at some other locations, the trend 
towards reduction, observed during the past two seasons, has been reversed.

27. Monitoring of beached marine debris in the Antarctic is being conducted annually by 
several CCAMLR Members. During the past two years, standard methods adopted by CCAMLR 
have been used for this purpose.

28. For two seasons in succession, packaging bands recovered had all been cut as required 
by CCAMLR. In addition to the recommended practice of cutting packaging bands after their 
removal from packages, CCAMLR prohibits, from the 1995/96 season, the use on fishing 
vessels of plastic packaging bands to secure bait boxes, and, from the 1996/97 season, the use 
of plastic packaging bands in general on vessels without on-board incinerators.

CCAMLR SYSTEM OF INSPECTION

29. The CCAMLR System of Inspection is in its seventh season of operation. For some time 
CCAMLR has been aware that effective enforcement of its conservation measures is essential but 
that this is extremely difficult given the size of the Southern Ocean and the costs involved in 
patrolling it. 
                                                                                          5
30. Further progress was made this year towards increasing the capacity of Inspectors to 
inspect vessels effectively in CCAMLR waters. Previously, inspectors have been able to board 
only vessels which are seen to be fishing. Now, all vessels may be inspected and inspectors 
will report that the vessel is presumed to have been engaged in harvesting, if:

    • fishing gear is in use, has recently been in use, or is about to be used;
    • fish which occur in the Convention Area are being processed or have recently been 
      processed;
    • fishing gear from the vessel is in the water; or
    • fish (or their products) which occur in the Convention Area are stowed on board.

Such reports will significantly improve the ability of Flag States to prosecute in cases of 
infraction.

31. For the past two years, CCAMLR has also been considering the applicability of a 
satellite-linked Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and a vessel notification system to the 
Convention Area as means of enforcing compliance with the CCAMLR fisheries management 
regime. However, while the need to enforce compliance was recognised, it has not yet been 
possible to develop a consensus on the topic. Possible means for enforcing compliance will be 
considered further at the next CCAMLR meeting.

COOPERATION WITHIN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM

32. The complementary nature of the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties 
(ATCP) and CCAMLR in protecting the marine environment was enhanced by the adoption of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Commission noted that the 
Chairman of the CCAMLR Scientific Committee would participate as observer in the work of a 
Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).

33. CCAMLR’s attention was drawn to a discussion which took place at the XIX Consultative 
Meeting on Article 2 of the draft Annex on Liability to the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection. CCAMLR was advised by its Chairman (France) of a request from the ATCM to 
provide an opinion on the two existing alternatives for Article 2.

34. This matter was discussed and the response prepared at the Fourteenth Meeting of the 
Commission. The Chairman of the Commission conveyed this response in February 1996 to 
the organizers of the XXth ATCM. A copy of the Chairman’s letter is attached (Appendix C).

6
35. It was further noted that, in the future, under the provisions of Annex V of the Protocol, CCAMLR would receive draft management plans from the Antarctic Treaty for Antarctic Specially Protected and Managed Areas (ASPAs and ASMAs), with requests for advice and approval by the Commission. The Commission endorsed the criteria established by the Scientific Committee for the assessment of the proposals.

36. The ASMA proposal for Admiralty Bay was the first made under Annex V to the Protocol and submitted to CCAMLR for consideration. The Commission concluded that those provisions of the proposed ASMA which affect the marine environment were consistent with the objectives of CCAMLR.

37. In the 1995/96 intersessional period, CCAMLR Members have not made any further proposals for protecting CEMP sites. At present, two CEMP sites located on the South Shetland Islands (Seal Islands and Cape Shirreff) are protected in accordance with the existing CCAMLR procedure.

38. During the intersessional period the CCAMLR Data Manager participated in the SCAR-COMNAP workshop on the practical design and implementation of environmental monitoring programs as required by Annex III to the Protocol on Environmental Protection. The workshop acknowledged that CCAMLR is currently the only organisation with extensive experience of monitoring programs designed for Antarctic conditions. Considerable interest was shown in the structure of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program and in several of CCAMLR's monitoring methods, especially those for bird populations and marine debris.

39. The CCAMLR Scientific Committee continues to maintain close coordination with several SCAR programs and, in particular, with such programs as:
	• Antarctic Pack-Ice Seals (APIS);
	• Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (SO-GLOBEC);
	• Coastal Zone Ecology of the Sea-Ice Zone (CZ-EASIZ); and
	• Global Changes in the Antarctic (GLOCHANT).

COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS

40. As well as the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), Observers from ASOC, CCSBT, FAO, IOC, IUCN, IWC and SCOR attended the Fourteenth Meeting of CCAMLR.
41. During the 1994/95 intersessional period CCAMLR was represented at meetings of
CCSBT, FAO, ICCAT, ICES, IWC, SPC, SPFFA and the UN.

42. CCAMLR continues to keep under constant review recent initiatives by the UN and FAO 
on high seas fisheries, in particular, the flagging of vessels on the high seas, 'a code of 
conduct' regarding fishing practices, and the UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.

43. CCAMLR is actively promoting wider awareness of its objectives and work within 
relevant international organisations and forums.

Dear Drs Bosman

XXth Antarctic Treaty Consulative Meeting
The Netherlands, 29 April to 10 May 1996

Draft Annex on Liability to the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

At the XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting held in Seoul, draft texts of an Annex on
Liability to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty were discussed.

As Chairman of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(CCAMLR), I was asked to seek the views of the Commission on the alternative texts of
Article 2.

This matter was discussed at the Fourteenth Meeting of the Commission, held in Hobart,
Australia from 24 October to 3 November 1995, and I attach a response which the
Commission asked me to send to the XXth ATCM. The response is in English, French,
Russian and Spanish.

Yours sincerely

Jacques Villemain
Chairman

Attch.
DRAFT ANNEX ON LIABILITY TO THE PROTOCOL ON
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

The question of the scope of the annex on liability to the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty 
on the Environment was considered by CCAMLR at its Fourteenth Meeting.

Various opinions were expressed by Members of the Commission, who are also 
represented at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCMs). This diversity of views may 
also be expressed again at the ATCM. However, a point of view was generally expressed, 
without a consensus having necessarily been reached, supporting the following two views:

1. Matters subject to regulation by CCAMLR should not involve liability under the 
annex on liability.

2. Activities or events associated with harvesting could fall within the scope of the 
annex on liability of the Protocol.
