Head of the Delegation of Japan

Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the Delegation of Japan, I would like to congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the XXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Government of the Netherlands for hosting this Meeting.

We recognise the importance of the comprehensive environmental protection of the Antarctica and place high priority the early entry into force of the Protocol for the Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty as well as enacting its domestic legislation. We look forward to achieving considerable progress at this Meeting in many issues relating to the implementation of the Protocol.

The establishment of an Secretariat which enables the Antarctic Treaty System to work more efficiently is also our great concern. In order to realise its early establishment, practical approach is needed, and we believe that the shortest way is the establishment by the Article IX of the Treaty.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure you that my Delegation is ready to make every effort to make this Meeting successful.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
