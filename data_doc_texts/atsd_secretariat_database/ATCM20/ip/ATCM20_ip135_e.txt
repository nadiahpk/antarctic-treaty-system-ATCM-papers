MESSAGE TO THE ATCM FROM HANS VAN MIERLO
MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS

(Submitted by the Secretariat)
MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Hague, 6 May 1996

Dear Mr[?]leijten[?],

Although I am regrettably unable to open your meeting as intended, I would like 
to take the opportunity of assuring you of my interest in your work.

The Netherlands attaches great significance to your continued efforts to preserve 
Antarctica intact. It is the only example of a large area where persistent 
endeavours by the international community have proved so successful. The 
collaborative nature of your work in this regard has also served the interests of 
peace and science.

Let me express the wish that you will be able to look back with satisfaction on 
this, the first ATCM to be held in the Netherlands, and that the Protocol on the 
protection of the Antarctic environment enters into force soon. I hope furthermore 
that you find not only the wisdom but also the patience to bring the negotiations 
on a liability annex to this Protocol ever closer to their conclusion.

Finally, I hope that you also find the opportunity to experience some of the many 
things which the Netherlands has to offer.

Hans van Mierlo
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands

To the delegates to the twentieth 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
