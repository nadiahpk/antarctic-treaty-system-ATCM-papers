INTRODUCTION


The Republic of Bulgaria acceded to the Antarctic Treaty in 1978, and 
thus became the twentieth contracting Party because of its firm conviction that 
Antarctica will forever be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and that 
international cooperation on the basis of freedom and scientific investigation in 
Antarctica will continue in the interest of all mankind.As a member of the 
Treaty, Bulgaria aims to contribute towards the active and continuous 
development of scientific knowledge of the area covered by this Treaty.

In the period 1993-96 Bulgaria organized three successive Antarctic 
campaigns. In the austral summer 1995-96 the fourth Bulgarian antarctic 
expedition was carried out. The national Antarctic Programme accepted and 
financed by the Bulgarian National Fund for scientific research was 
broadened.The Programme is multidisciplinary in approach and includes 
several research projects in the field of biology, geology, glaciology, 
meteorology, physics and human medicine which investigate problems of 
present interest for today's Antarctic science.

A new living complex with a scientific laboratory was transported to the 
Bulgarian summer base " St. Kliment Ochridski" during the season 1995-96.

Management, coordination and development of the Programme are in the 
hands of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Fund for Scientific 
Research, the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute and the National SCAR Committee 
on Antarctic Research.
ACTIVITIES FOR 1995-96

I. DETAILS OF SHIPS AND AIRCRAFTS

For the reallization of its scientific projects Bulgaria uses the Spanish vessel
BIO " Hesperides" as a result of bilateral cooperation with the Spanish
Antarctic Programme.

II. EXPEDITION ITINERARY

1 December 1995- 29 February 1996

III. DETAILS OF STATIONS

During the 1993-94 Antarctic campaign the refuge located on the North-East
side of the South Bay, Livingston Island was reconstructed and put in operation
as a summer base. With an Act of the President of the Republic of Bulgaria the
Base was named "St. Kliment Ochridski".During 1995-96 summer season
materials*for the construction of new small building was transported.
