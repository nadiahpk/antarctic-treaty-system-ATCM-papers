TOTN P 04
INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS PREPARED BY AUSTRALIA IN 1995

Activity:         Erection of a radio transmission antenna

Location:        Davis Station (68-35'S, 110-32'E)

Responsible organisation:        Australian Antarctic Division

Description:     This IEE relates to the proposed erection of a tandem delta antenna at 
                 Davis station. This type of antenna is used for High Frequency (HF) radio communications with 
                 field parties, aircraft and ships. The antenna will solve poor performance of HF transmit 
                 antennas in support of various operations (a result of the essentially directional nature of the 
                 existing rhombic antenna and the range characteristics of the existing conical monopole 
                 antenna). With the operation of long range helicopters and some remote field locations, an 
                 antenna with omnidirectional coverage over a range of up to about 1000 km is required.

Decision:        Approved in November 1995.
------------------------------------------------

Activity:        Construction of a new workshop

Location:        Mawson Station (67-36'S, 62-53'E)

Responsible organisation:        Australian Antarctic Division

Description:     This IEE relates to the proposed construction of a new workshop to 
                 provide upgraded facilities for the diesel mechanics, electrician and plumber. The proposed 
                 building forms part of the Mawson station reconstruction program. Construction of the 
                 workshop will directly involve an area measuring 22.6 m x 15.4 m. The IEE examined options 
                 for location of the building and considered the potential impacts on the historic values of the old 
                 station buildings erected in 1954.

Decision:        Approved in November 1995
Activity:     Installation and operation of a LIDAR instrument

Location:     Davis Station (68-35'S, 110-32'E)

Responsible organisation:     Australian Antarctic Division

Description:     This IEE relates to the proposed establishment and operation of an Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system for the study of the Antarctic middle atmosphere. The instrument will be housed in a modular observatory building 13 m (length) by 5 m (width) by 7 m (height). The LIDAR will transmit a beam of pulsed green laser light into the sky. The laser beam will normally be directed vertically but at certain times it will be pointed along a number of azimuths with a zenith angle not exceeding 45'. The LIDAR system will be operated during both day and night under 'fair weather' (minimal cloud cover and surface wind speed) conditions.

Decision:     Approved in February 1996
Initial Environmental Evaluations Prepared by New Zealand in 1995

Improvements to Bulk Fuel Storage  and Transport Facilities at Scott Base,
New Zealand Antarctic Programme

Purpose of Activity:

Improvements to the bulk fuel storage and transport procedures at Scott Base, the main
science support facility for New Zealand Antarctic activities, were identified as
necessary by both NZAP staff and in a number of independent reports on the
Programme's activities. In particular, an independent environmental audit carried out
on New Zealand's practices at Scott Base in 1993 identified that the current arrangement
for the storage of bulk fuel posed a risk to the nearby marine ecosystem.

Description of Activity:

2   A comprehensive approach to fuel management, storage facilities and transport
has been developed. It is proposed to relocate the tanks from the shore area, double skin
and bund them to provide adequate protection from a leak or spillage. The proposal to
improve the bulk fuel storage and transport facilities at Scott Base, involves the
replacement of the two JP8 bulk fuel tanks currently supplying fuel to Scott Base with
two double skinned tanks. The tanks are to be located approximately 400 metres behind
Scott Base. An elevated pipeline is proposed to run from a connection with the United
States Antarctic Program fuel line from McMurdo Station to the JP8 tanks and from the
tanks to Scott Base, at a point close to the water storage tank. The JP8 base supply tank
will be relocated to a site adjacent to the existing vehicle hitching rail. Containment
structures will be erected around this tank

Type of EIA Undertaken:

3   An Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) was completed for this activity.

Location of the Activity:

4   Scott Base, Ross Island, Antarctica

Organisation Responsible for the EIA:

5   New Zealand Antarctic Programme
    P O Box 18 091
    Christchurch
    NEW ZEALAND
Decisions taken following consideration of EIA:

6   The original location site, directly behind Scott Base, was changed due to health 
    and safety concerns with the radio masts, antennae and other electro-magnetic 
    equipment situated behind the Base. The tanks will now be relocated further up the hill 
    behind the Base.

7   The proposal to use fines (washed gravel), imported from New Zealand, to line 
    the tank bunds was discarded as inappropriate in view of the restrictions on introducing 
    organic material to Antarctica. It was agreed that, as an alternative, the tanks would be 
    double-skinned. This is a proven technology to provide containment space for escaped 
    fuel to accumulate.

8   Copies of the full IEE prepared for this activity will be circulated at ATCM XX.

Vinson Massif and Mount Tyree: Adventure Consultants. Christchurch, New Zealand

Purpose of Activity:

The purpose of the proposed activity is to establish new climbing routes on Vinson Massif and Mount Tyree, the two highest peaks in Antarctica. All previous ascents have been from the West, this expedition plans to climb from the eastern side of the mountain range.

Description of Activity:

2       The proposed activity is for a light weight, self-contained four person mountaineering expedition to climb the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains in West Antarctica. A small field camp will be established at 2500 metres at the head of the Crosswell Glacier on the east side of the Sentinel Range. From this location an attempt will be made on Mount Vinson and secondly on Mount Tyree. Alpine style techniques will be used so that the team will be self-contained and fully equipped at all times. There will be no relaying of equipment and therefore no equipment will be abandoned. The expedition plans to be in the field for 18 days (see attached itinerary).

Type of EIA Undertaken:

3       An Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) was completed for this activity.

Location of the Activity:

4       Base camp: Crosswell Glacier below Mount Tyree and Mount Epperley, West Antarctica.

        Climbing Route: Vinson Massif and Mount Tyree

Decisions taken following consideration of EIA:

6   An evaluation will be supplied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 
    the impact of the activity with particular reference to waste disposal, retrograding of all 
    equipment brought into the area, the restoration of camp and tent site facilities, and any 
    impact made by the party as a result of establishing new climbing routes.

Monitoring of Activities

6   The Expedition Leader will keep a log of the dates. times and duration of each 
    landing. Procedures will be kept under review and amendments or improvements will 
    be made where necessary. On all cruises a New Zealand national representative will be 
    on-board to assist with the visits to the historic huts and to observe compliance with 
    ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1 and Resolution XIX-3.

Briefing of Passengers

7   In addition to the comprehensive briefing material which is provided to all 
    passengers prior to departure, there are also lectures and briefings during the cruise. 
    These briefings serve to highlight environmental/conservation issues as well as to 
    emphasis the various protocols when dealing with Antarctic flora and fauna and of the 
    Environmental Protocol in general.

Decisions taken following consideration of EIA:

8   More precise information on the landing sites was supplied. The section on 
    potential impact on wildlife (originally an Annex) was given more prominence in the 
    body of the document.

INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION PREPARED BY SOUTH AFRICA IN 1995

Activity:     Burning of approximately 100 tonnes of untreated crate timber during the 
              1995/1996 Austral summer.

Location:    SANAE III on the Fimbul ice shelf 15 km from the coast.

Description: This IEE relates to the disposal of approximately 100 tonnes of untreated waste 
             timber by way of open burning on the ice shelf. The accumulation of timber was 
             a result of the difficulty and dangers related to the strapping, transport and transfer 
             to the ship.

Decision:    The burning of untreated timber was allowed within the requirements of Annex III 
             to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty: Article 3 and 
             under the following conditions:

             •  Only untreated timber material may be burned.
             •  Burning may only take place at the old SANAE III in a designated area 
                where burning has been permitted in the past.
             •  Burning may only take place under strict supervision.
             •  The arrangement only applies to the 1995/1996 construction phase.
             •  The disposal process of untreated waste timber is subject to review after 
                the 1995/1996 construction phase.

Initial evaluation of the environmental impact 
of the Base Professor Julio Escudero

Description of the activities.

The construction of a living module for 8 persons, with installations for additional services, with a 
wastewater plant and a module for an electric generator.

Type of environmental evaluation.

An Initial Evaluation of the Environmental Impact -EIA- has been made, due to the fact that there 
has been built in an area that had already been altered in the past, were other installations of the 
"INACH" (laboratories and workshops) are built, and roads that connect with other chilean and 
foreign bases. On the constructionsite does not exist antarctic flora or fauna.
