REPORT

on the Joint Russian-Canadian Ecological Project
at Bellingshausen station, King George is., Antarctica.

While Madrid Protocol has still not been ratified in Russia and under permanent underfunding of activity in Antarctica, the Russian Antarctic Expedition is seeking for all possible ways to improve the ecological situation in the areas of Russian stations in Antarctica.

Under the circumstances and at least until the Madrid Protocol is signed the RAE encourages cooperation with both other national Antarctic Programs and organisations interested in Antarctica and able to provide substancial assistance in terms of implementation of the Protocol.

The results of joint use of RAE logistics at Bellingshausen station by Russian Antarctic Ltd and Canadian non-profitable organisation VIEW Foundation which proposed a joint ecological project on clean-up the station and waste removal from Antarctica by the ships chartered by the sponsoring Marine Expeditions company are considered by us to be positive.

The Joint Russian-Canadian Ecological Project was conducted over the period 14 December 1995 - 5 March 1996 of the 13 camps with a participation of 54 volunteers and a permanent staff of 3. Participants of the project were hosted at Bellingshausen station, King George Island. Camps were run over a 4/5 day period. The volunteer groups were changed by the ships chartered by the Marine Expeditions.

The goal of the joint ecological project was to offer volunteers the opportunity to learn about Antarctica while on-land with a focus on conservation and to participate in conservation tasks mostly physical clean-up work. The project managers tried to keep a good balance between a fun, educational program and hands-on volunteer service project.

During the project the volunteers removed debris from in both the immediate camp area and at the fuel storage facility (Stoney Bay) for removal at the end of summer season.

Most of the clean up work at Stoney Bay involved picking up larger items many originating back to the construction of the facility and others accumulated during maintenace work. Waste consisted of welding rods, scrap metal, wood fragments, glass.

A large fuel hose was also cut up and bundled for disposal. The work in the station area involved detailed cleaning of areas, most of debris consisted
