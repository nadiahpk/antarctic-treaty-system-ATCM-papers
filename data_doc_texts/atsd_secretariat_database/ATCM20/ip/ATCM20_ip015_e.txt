Recent developments in Antarctic tourism

Recent growth in Antarctic tourist activity

For the fifth consecutive season, record numbers of tourists 
visited the Antarctic Treaty Area (south of 60°S latitude)1.
A total of 10,649 tourists travelled to Antarctica during the 
1994/95 season including 8,297 aboard ships, 96 aboard 
yachts2, 128 aboard landing aircraft and 2,128 aboard 
overflights3 of the continent.  This represents a four-fold 
increase in tourist numbers over the last five years.  Between 
January 1958 and March 1995, a total of 559 cruises have 
carried more than 68,000 tourists to Antarctica.  Table 1 
provides details.  Figures 1 to 3 illustrate the increases in 
numbers of Antarctic cruise tourists, cruises made and ships 
used to make cruises.

Scale of tourist activity during the 1994/95 season

During the 1994/95 season 16 ships brought nearly 8,300 
tourists to the Antarctic.  This represents an increase of 
more than 6% over the previous season's record high of 7,790 
shipborne tourists.  Fourteen commercial tour operators made a 
total of 94 Antarctic cruises during the 1994/95 season; most 
visited the Antarctic Peninsula.  Two cruises visited the 
Weddell Sea, three ships visited the Ross Sea region and one 
made a semi-circumnavigation of Antarctica.  It is estimated 
that at least 30 tourists travelled to Antarctica aboard
Chilean Navy vessels. This activity represents more than a 
40% increase in the number of cruises conducted during the 
previous season (1993/94). During the 1994/95 season, nearly 
85% of cruise tourists travelled aboard ships operated by 
members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour 
Operators (IAATO), an increase of nearly 2% over the previous 
season. Table 2 provides a list of ships used, operators, 
numbers of cruises and tourists and other relevant details 
concerning shipborne tourism during the 1994/95 season.

Approximately 1,700 berths aboard cruise ships went unused 
during the 1994/95 season. On average, cruise ships travelled 
nearly 83% full. Had all cruises been fully booked, a total 
of nearly 10,000 passengers would have visited Antarctica. 
The dominant cruise operator during the 1994/95 season was 
Marine Expeditions conducting 32 cruises (one-third of those 
offered) which carried 23% of shipborne tourists.

At least 16 yachts visited the Treaty Area during the 1994/95 
season. Of these, at least six are known to have carried 
fare-paying passengers and two made more than one trip. One 
yacht carried more than 10 persons. Table 3 provides yacht 
names, destinations, numbers aboard and other details. The 
majority of yachts that offered tourist charters were based at 
Ushuaia, Argentina4. Nearly half of the yachts sailed under 
the French flag during the 1994/95 season, although the 
respective nationalities of many of the yacht owners, crew and 
passengers are not known.
Adventure Network International (ANI) carried 128 tourists aboard Lockheed L-382G (wheeled) Hercules flights from Punta Arenas to their base camp at Patriot Hills.  Many were later transported aboard smaller aircraft (e.g. Twin Otters) for mountain climbing trips, visits to the geographic South Pole or trips to the Emperor Penguin colony at Dawson-Lambton Glacier.  Of the 14 Hercules flights that were made during the 1994/95 season, six carried fuel only.5 Aérovias DAP of Punta Arenas operated tourist flights to Chile's Teniente Rodolfo Marsh Station on King George Island using King Air and Twin Otter aircraft6, but figures for these flights are not reflected in the above totals.

Qantas re-introduced overflights of Antarctica during the 1994/95 season.  The six Boeing 747 flights that were marketed7 proved very popular and more were offered during the 1995/96 season.8 Croydon Travel Centre, the Australian company that marketed these trips, has requested information from IAATO, but not membership.9

1995/96 season activity: preliminary statistics

NSF estimated that more than 9,000 tourists would visit Antarctica aboard 133 cruises during the 1995/96 season.10 Airborne, yacht and government-affiliated tourism will also contribute to what may be another record-breaking season.
Significant trends

Of the more than 10,000 tourists who visited the Treaty Area during the 1994/95 season 78% of them travelled aboard cruise ships.  In comparison, during the 1993/94 season, more than 97% of Antarctic tourists arrived aboard cruise ships.  Nearly half of all shipborne tourists who have ever visited Antarctica travelled there from 1990/91 through 1994/95. 
Table 4 documents the growth in Antarctic shipborne tourism by decade.

The number of Antarctic tour operators continues to increase. 
The 14 tour operators that offered cruises to the Treaty Area during the 1994/95 season represent a slight increase over the 13 that operated during the 1993/94 season.  Five of the 14 operators were new to the Antarctic during the 1994/95 season.  In comparison, four cruise companies operated in the Treaty Area for the first time during the 1993/94 season.  Of the 13 operators from the 1993/94 season, six did not return during the 1994/95 season although personnel from some of these companies gained employment with other Antarctic tour operators.  In comparison, of the 12 cruise operators known to have carried passengers during the 1992/93 season, five did not return during the 1993/94 season.  Ten cruise operators brought tourists during the 1991/92 season and seven carried passengers during the 1990/91 season.11
Increasing numbers of Antarctic sites are used for tourism,
especially as new areas are visited. During the 1994/95
season, 91 sites were visited in the Treaty Area by the
operators that reported to NSF.12 Landings were made at 82 of
these sites. Nine were used solely for boat cruising trips.
A combination of boat cruising trips and landings were made at
18 of the sites. Therefore, a total of 27 sites were used for
boat cruising. One cruise operator landed 116 passengers on
pack ice in Crystal Sound (66°23'S, 66°30'W). One IAATO
member submitted incomplete data to NSF concerning sites
visited in the Treaty Area during the same season.13 In
comparison, 69 sites in the Antarctic were visited during the
1993/94 season by the operators that reported to NSF14 and 51
sites were visited in the Antarctic Peninsula region by such
operators during the 1992/93 season.15

Increasing numbers of tourists are visiting popular sites in
the Treaty Area each season. For example, for the operators
that reported to NSF, the site visited by the most tourists
during the 1994/95 season was Whalers Bay, Deception Island;
66 visits were made by a total of 5,241 tourists. Prior to
that, the greatest number reported by such operators for one
site was 4,274 at Port Lockroy, Wiencke Island during the
1993/94 season. Table 5 provides details concerning the five
most popular Antarctic visitor sites from 1991/92 through
1994/95. The sole cruise by Eugenio Costa and the second
cruise by Vistamar during the 1994/95 season reportedly made
no landings in the Treaty Area.16 Eugenio Costa planned to
visit Esperanza station and offer boat cruising trips in
Paradise Harbour, but these activities were cancelled due to weather conditions.17

Eighteen percent of Antarctic cruise passengers (1,457) travelled aboard ships with a capacity of 250 or more during the 1994/95 season; down from 40% (3,093 passengers) during the 1993/94 season and 50% (3,447 passengers) during the 1992/93 season. This trend is expected to continue during the 1995/96 season if cruise operators use the ships advertised in their brochures and carry out plans notified to NSF.18

As Table 1 and Figure 3 demonstrate, the number of ships used for Antarctic tourism has increased considerably in recent years. The 16 ships used during the 1994/95 season tied the previous record from the 1992/93 season. This represents a trebling of the figure over the past five seasons. Given the recent increase in smaller capacity ships used for Antarctic tourism, it is not clear that such practice will have any effect on decreasing visitor pressure at popular sites, especially if numbers of cruise tourists continue to increase. For example, NSF figures for the 1994/95 season reveal that 11 sites were visited by two different vessels on the same day and three sites were visited by three or more vessels on the same day. The latter case included Whalers Bay, Deception Island; Baily Head, Deception Island; and Almirante Brown (station), Paradise Harbour.19
Eight of the cruise ships used during the 1994/95 season were 
registered in Russia. The availability of these ships for 
charter has played an important role in the recent increase in 
Antarctic cruise tourism. Furthermore, during the same 
season, six of the tour ships were used for Antarctic cruises 
for the first time. Of these, four were registered in Russia 
and one in Estonia.

The increased numbers of European operators and passengers 
noted during the 1991/92 through 1993/94 seasons20 were 
sustained during the 1994/95 season when at least 36% were 
European.21  The nationalities of 7,751 cruise tourists were 
compiled by NSF from figures reported by cruise operators at 
the end of the season.  Of these, 2,775 were from Europe.  The 
1,507 Germans made up 54% of the European cruise passengers 
and 19% of all cruise passengers for the season.  More than 
38% (2,985) of these cruise passengers were from the United 
States.  Overall, figures for the 1994/95 season reveal that 
tourists from more than 50 countries were represented aboard 
ships run by operators that reported to NSF.22

The number of tourist charter trips aboard yachts visiting the 
Treaty Area is increasing.  There appears to be a trend for 
charter yachts to carry greater numbers of people and for more 
yachts to carry domesticated cats and dogs (e.g. three yachts 
are known to have done so during the 1994/95 season).23  Three 
yachts (Kekilistrion, Kotick and Pelagic) carried fare-paying 
passengers aboard Antarctic trips during three of the four 
seasons from 1991/92 through 1994/95, whilst the yacht Croix
St Paul II offered tourist charters to the Treaty Area during 
each of these four seasons.24

Wheeled Hercules landings were made on a blue-ice runway in 
the Antarctic interior by ANI for the second consecutive 
season in 1994/95. This represents a significant development 
in Antarctic tourism since it increases the potential for new 
areas, adjacent to other blue-ice in the Treaty Area, to be 
used for tourism.

The great majority of overflight passengers during the 1994/95 
season were from Australia, but other nationalities were 
represented and this trend increased for overflights offered 
during the 1995/96 season.26 In particular, tourists from 
Japan, Korea (Seoul) and Taiwan constitute an emerging market 
for these flights.

Conclusions

Record numbers of tourists visited the Antarctic during the 
1994/95 season. Evidence suggests numbers are likely to 
continue to grow. Cruises to the Weddell Sea were offered for 
the second consecutive season. A partial circumnavigation of 
Antarctica was made by one cruise ship during the 1994/95 
season and the first full circumnavigation of Antarctica is 
planned for the 1996/97 season. Increasing numbers of ships 
are being used for Antarctic tours, more cruises are being 
made, especially those by operators new to Antarctica, more 
sites are being visited and popular sites are being visited by
greater numbers of tourists. Wheeled aircraft carrying 
tourists landed at a blue-ice runway in the interior for the 
second consecutive season in 1994/95. Overflights of 
Antarctica resumed and were offered for the second consecutive 
season (1995/96).

                lack of data on shipborne tourism between the
                1958/59 and 1965/66 seasons.  The sudden rise in
                the number of shipborne tourists during the 1974/75
                season is due to cruises offered by large ships
                with capacities of 474 and 800 respectively.

1993/94 and 1994/95 seasons, as reported by US-based tour operators to the US National 
Science Foundation. These figures represent minimum numbers since some operators did 
not report to NSF (most notably for the 1992/93 season) and others are not required to do 
so since they are based outside of the US. Sources: National Research Council25, NSF

Addendum

The yacht Itasca also visited the Antarctic Treaty Area during 
the 1994/95 season. This 210 foot motor vessel which flies 
the US flag made one trip that carried approximately 15-20 
passengers and reached Marguerite Bay.1
