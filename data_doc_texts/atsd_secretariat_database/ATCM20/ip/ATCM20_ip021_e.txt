REPORT OF THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO) IN RELATION
TO ARTICLE 111 (2) OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Since XIX ATCM WMO activities in relation to Antarctica have been:

-   The twelfth Congress of the World Meteorological 
    Organization (Cg XII) was held in Geneva in June 1995. In 
    relation to its Antarctic program Congress,
    -   assessed that most of the planned targets in the WMO 
        Third Long Term Plan for Antarctica had been met and 
        adopted draft WMO Antarctic Activities for inclusion in 
        the Fourth Long Term Plan.
    -   noted that the Executive Council WMO Working Group on 
        Antarctic Meteorology (EC-WGAM) had been reestablished 
        with revised terms of reference.
    -   was pleased to note that the Antarctic Regional Basic 
        Synoptic Network (RBSN) had been expanded by inclusion 
        of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and Automatic 
        Geophysical Observatories and that an International 
        Programme for Antarctic Buoys had been established.
    -   welcomed continued WMO contact with the International 
        Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and urged WMO 
        members to recruit tourist ships for the Voluntary 
        Observing Ships scheme.
    -   noted again the deficiencies in the observing network 
        in Antarctica particularly over Western Antarctica and 
        delays in insertion of data into the telecommunication 
        system. It re-emphasised target times for reception of 
        Antarctic data.
    -   requested the EC-WGAM to seek to coordinate the 
        deployment of new AWS and the maintenance of continuous 
        observations at existing stations.
    -   welcomed the EC-WGAM Survey of Antarctic historical 
        data and the preparation of a data catalogue to assist 
        in the SCAR Antarctic Data Directory System.
    -   encouraged WMO Members to expand ozone observations in 
        Antarctica and to provide the observations to the WMO 
        Global Watch Data Centres.  It also noted the 
        importance of maintaining close contact with the 
        Secretariats of the UN Framework on Climate Change, the 
        Montreal Protocol and the Vienna Convention for the 
        Protection of the Ozone Layer in relation to Antarctic 
        programs.

-    confirmed continued contact with appropriate 
     international groups dealing with Antarctic policy, 
     science and operations in particular ATCM, SCAR, COMNAP 
     and IOC noting particularly IOC and WMO participation 
     in the First Southern Ocean Forum.

     The WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic 
     Meteorology [EC-WGAM] maintained work on network 
     development, the monitoring of the effectiveness of 
     Antarctic meteorological telecommunications, the development 
     of an annual reporting system and the development of a 
     catalogue of historical data.

     WMO has provided information papers for other relevant 
     agenda items of XX ATCM.
