ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING:
DRAFT INVENTORY OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS

Information Paper submitted to the XX ATCM

Agenda Item 15: Education and Training

Submitted by IUCN, The World Conservation Union's
Antarctic Advisory Committee, April 1996

I. BACKGROUND

1. The proceedings of the SCAR-IUCN Workshop on Environmental Education and Training, Gorizia, Italy, April 1993, have now been published as Dingwall, P. and Walton, D. (eds.), Opportunities for Antarctic Environmental Education and Training, Southern Polar Regions Monograph No. 3, IUCN, Cambridge 1996. The principal recommendations are attached as Appendix 1 of this Information Paper.

2. The report draws attention to a wide range of Antarctic environmental education and training programs in various nations, but notes that amongst ATCPs there are no consistent guidelines or curricula which would:

    (a) inform visitors about the Treaty System or indicate how to minimise human impacts in Antarctica;
    (b) provide instruction for expedition staff about environmental monitoring or environmental safeguards in Antarctica; or
    (c) help develop appropriate specialist training about environmental science or policy, or the protected areas system in Antarctica.

3. Some Treaty nations do have excellent programs in these areas, but little information exists as to needs or opportunities in other nations.

4. At XIX ATCM, the representative of the IUCN offered to approach the World Conservation Union to see whether it would be wiling to help develop a draft directory of those Antarctic environmental education and training courses currently available.

5. The IUCN agreed that its Antarctic Advisory Committee should compile an inventory of current education and training programs amongst Treaty participants. A first draft of this is attached as Appendix 2.

6. To date, information has been received from the following countries: Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, USA, Chile, Norway and South Africa. IUCN would encourage Parties to forward current information to Professor Bruce Davis, at the address listed at the end of Appendix 2. A more complete listing will then be prepared for XXI ATCM.
7.    Attention is drawn to XIX ATCM Information Paper 62 and comments in the Final 
      Report of XIX ATCM, Agenda Item 7(b)(6). Four proposals submitted by SCAR and IUCN 
      were noted:

      (a)    the need for an inventory of environmental education and training programs;
      (b)    the value of a lay guide to the Protocol, which could be used for visitor and 
             public education;
      (c)    the designation of publicly accessible depository libraries for information on 
             Antarctica and the Protocol; and
      (d)    the need to include education and training on the agenda of all future 
             ATCMs.

8.    Several delegations supported these suggestions, but no action decisions were taken. 
      IUCN therefore recommends that a small Working Party be established, preferably acting 
      through SCAR and COMNAP, to report to the XXI ATCM on means of facilitating and 
      improving Antarctic education and training, especially for visitors and expeditionary staff. 
      A specific action program and timescale should be specified, with clear performance 
      indicators.

IUCN - The World Conservation Union

Founded in 1948, The World Conservation Union brings together States, government agencies 
and a diverse range of non-governmental organizations in a unique world partnership: over 842 
members in all, spread across some 132 countries.

As a Union, IUCN seeks to influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to 
conserve the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is 
equitable and ecologically sustainable. A central secretariat coordinates the IUCN Programme and 
serves the Union membership, representing their views on the world stage and providing them 
with the strategies, services, scientific knowledge and technical support they need to achieve their 
goals. Through its six Commissions, IUCN draws together over 6000 expert volunteers in project 
teams and action groups, focusing in particular on species and biodiversity conservation and the 
management of habitats and natural resources. The Union has helped many countries to prepare 
National Conservation Strategies, and demonstrates the application of its knowledge through the 
field projects it supervises. Operations are increasingly decentralized and are carried forward by 
an expanding network of regional and country offices, located principally in developing countries.

The World Conservation Union builds on the strengths of its members, networks and partners 
to enhance their capacity and to support global alliances to safeguard natural resources at local, 
regional and global levels.

SCAR - The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research

SCAR is a committee of ICSU, the International Council of Scientific Unions, and is charged with 
the initiation, promotion and co-ordination of scientific research in Antarctica.

It is the single multinational, multidisciplinary, non-governmental organization which draws on 
the experience and expertise of an international mix of specialists across the complete scientific 
spectrum to offer advice on a wide range of scientific questions and problems. Since its estab-
lishment in 1957 SCAR has provided such advice to the Antarctic Treaty System and made 
numerous recommendations on a diversity of matters, most of which have been incorporated into 
Antarctic Treaty instruments. Foremost among these has been advice for the many instruments 
concerning protection of the biota and environment of Antarctica.

Membership of SCAR comprises the National Committees of those national scientific acade-
mies which are adhering bodies to ICSU and which are, or plan to be, active in Antarctic research, 
together with the relevant Scientific Unions of ICSU. SCAR meets every two years to conduct its 
administrative business at the SCAR Delegates Meeting. The scientific business of SCAR is 
conducted by its Working Groups and Groups of Specialists. These represent the scientific 
disciplines active in Antarctic research. The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and 
Conservation (GOSEAC) is the multidisciplinary group most closely associated with providing 
advice to the Antarctic Treaty and was the SCAR co-sponsor with IUCN of the present Workshop.

Introduction

The specific purpose of the Workshop was to bring together people with experience in Antarctic science, conservation, education, training and communication in order to:

- exchange information on the subject of environmental education and training for those who work in or visit the Antarctic and Subantarctic regions;

- identify needs for advancing this subject;

- review and document the resources available; and

- make recommendations on future requirements and activities.

The objectives for achieving this were as follows:

- To examine the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and other legal instruments and policies, in terms of their implications for environmental education and training needs.

- To review and compile information on the resources and networks of people, organisations and institutions currently involved in environmental education and training in the Antarctic Region, and the potential for further developing these.

- To consider and make recommendations on the environmental education and training needs of scientists and their support staff, tourists, and others who visit the Antarctic Region.

To identify the opportunities for raising public awareness of the Antarctic and Subantarctic regions and their conservation.

                                                                 Summary of Discussion and Recommendations

1.  Legal and Policy Issues

1.1  Antarctica

This session began with discussion of the obligations for environmental education and training required by the Antarctic Treaty System. It included an assessment of how effective the dissemination of information and training have been. It was noted that, while the Madrid Protocol includes requirements for information exchange among Treaty Parties and for making information available to a wider audience, the Protocol does not identify in a focused way the needs for education and training that are essential for its effective implementation.

Accordingly the Workshop recommended:

1.1.1  That the Treaty Parties, drawing upon the advice of SCAR, collaborate in the publication of a lay guide on the environmental protection obligations of the Protocol, and that they subsequently promote and distribute that guide to their Antarctic operators and to all who might visit the Antarctic.

1.1.2  That the Treaty Parties elaborate a comprehensive training programme to assist in the effective implementation of the Protocol, and that they include in the functions of the Committee for Environmental Protection advice on environmental education and training.

1.2  Subantarctic Region

The session reviewed environmental education policies and practices in place at Subantarctic islands, under national jurisdictions. It was noted that, despite the different juridical situations, some lessons from the Subantarctic islands may be valuable for the Antarctic. The usefulness of management plans as a tool for translating laws and policies into practical management objectives and actions was highlighted, as well as the further step of producing a guidebook to explain the objectives of management and their implications to visitors to the islands.

Accordingly, the Workshop recommended:

1.2.1  That a comprehensive bibliographic listing of all Subantarctic island management plans and related documents (entry permits, policy statements, etc.) be prepared as part of the Workshop proceedings.

1.2.2  That a list containing a representative selection of island educational and publicity materials including books, maps and films and their location and availability be included in the Workshop proceedings, if possible.
Opportunities for Antarctic Environmental Education and Training


1.2.3 That all appropriate national authorities be urged to develop environmental 
education, training and public awareness policies and implementation 
programmes as part of a Subantarctic island management planning process.

2. Formal Education

This session first examined examples of higher education and training programmes in 
Australasia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The increased 
demand for such programmes consequent upon the Madrid Protocol requirements was 
noted, as was the absence of any comprehensive survey of the needs and opportunities 
for Antarctic environmental education and training. The experimental course at the 
Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies, at the University of Tasmania in 
Hobart, Australia, which is designed to provide training relating to obligations of the 
Madrid Protocol, was seen as being particularly relevant. A comparative view was 
presented for three Latin American states—Chile, Argentina and Brazil—and the value 
of combining theoretical and practical studies (fieldwork) was stressed. Discussion also 
included the importance of environmental education and training at primary and 
secondary school levels.

Accordingly the Workshop recommended:

2.1 That, pursuant to Article 6.1(a) of the Protocol on Environmental Protection 
which states, "Each Party shall endeavour to promote cooperative programmes 
of scientific, technical and educational value, concerning the protection of the 
Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems"; Antarctic 
environmental education at a tertiary level should be undertaken nationally and 
information passed to other countries through an agreed designated node, 
institution or contact point.

2.2 That Antarctic environmental education at a tertiary level should be recognised 
by the Treaty Parties as an important subject for international exchange and 
cooperation through studentships, staff exchange and information and resource 
sharing.

[Antarctica is the only instance where international continental-wide 
environmental management can be applied and therefore this recommendation 
is supported as encouraging the sharing of expertise and of providing appropriate 
assistance to contribute towards the protection of the Antarctic environment and 
its dependent and associated ecosystems and to ensuring that activities in the 
Antarctic Treaty area do not have an adverse impact on the environment. This 
recommendation will, by the process of international 'cross-fertilisation', assist 
in the evolution of Antarctica as a special area of study not just in various 
branches of science concerned with environmental education but also in other 
learning and research fields such as in the legal/political and policy areas. 
'Bilateral' exchanges in Antarctic environmental education are worth fostering 
for all their potential benefits despite the problems of cost, language, cultural 
differences, sovereignty, and the visa and exchange requirements that different 
governments possess.]

xii


2.3 That, recognising the importance of Antarctica in global environmental 
processes, governments should have the goal of ensuring that present and future 
generations are made aware of the significance of the Antarctic continent and 
its dependent and associated ecosystems by incorporating, wherever possible, 
teaching about these processes and these unique systems at all levels within 
national educational systems.

2.4 That teaching about these processes and systems is coordinated by national 
authorities within the relevant curricula for primary, secondary and tertiary 
education so that the associated themes and issues and an understanding of the 
systems and processes themselves is covered in a sequential manner.

[Any coordination of Antarctic environmental education on a national basis at 
the primary through to the tertiary level, by incorporation into existing curricula, 
will also assist in the promotion of consistent standards as will those measures 
associated with international exchange and cooperation in recommendation 2.2 
above.]

2.5 That a comprehensive survey and documentation of Antarctic environmental 
education be carried out by a university institution such as SPRI and/or IASOS. 
This survey should include details about courses that are offered, their content 
and duration as well as their approach (i.e. theoretical, practical or applied) and 
to have this work completed by, for example, student(s) research topics. This 
survey should also identify the range of needs at the post-school level and how 
they are met by present courses that are both short and long term, academic and 
practical, undergraduate and advanced, as well as those that offer training in the 
form of refresher courses, or in teacher training and through 'training the 
trainers' at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels.

[Thus, a diversity of treatments can at present be identified as being necessary, 
at a range of levels, from courses on waste management/cleaner production 
techniques and technologies to environmental monitoring methodologies for the 
effective implementation of the Madrid Protocol. The relationship of global 
environmental issues and processes to national Antarctic policies and strategies 
and how national environmental strategies are related to Antarctic 
environmental issues should also be considered.]

2.6 That a coverage of extracurricular courses for the general public on awareness 
of the Antarctic environment be undertaken as part of the survey to be done in 
recommendation 2
3. Education and Training for Scientists and Support Staff
of National Programmes

Current experience from the national programmes of the United Kingdom, the United 
States of America, Australia and New Zealand was described. It was clear the great extent 
to which there were common practices involving the provision of relevant literature, the 
provision of general briefings for all personnel with specific briefings for smaller groups 
with specialised deployment needs, and an assessment of the effectiveness of training, 
using post-season debriefings. The workshop concluded that experiences should be 
shared among national programmes. Sanctions are needed for those transgressing 
environmental standards, so as to encourage wider understanding of regulations and it is 
vital that educational materials used are appropriate if they are to be effective. Emergency 
training is vitally important and some form of assessment of training effort is required to 
make sure the effort is cost effective.

Accordingly the Workshop recommended:

3.1    That proposed training methods from the Workshop be considered by 
       COMNAP, with a view to promoting their implementation and the sharing of 
       experiences of national programmes among national operators.

3.2    That where behaviour and activity is observed contrary to the Protocol 
       (reflecting a lack of understanding of the Protocol's provisions) these should be 
       reported to national operators and, if necessary, to other relevant authorities for 
       appropriate action to be taken.

3.3    That appropriate hazard contingency training to address emergency response 
       action for fire, oil spill, laboratory, field, ship and aircraft emergencies should 
       be practised frequently by all relevant personnel.

3.4    That national programme training officers should consider making written 
       material visually attractive, concise and informative; and should consider the 
       introduction of video training aids, the use of theoretical and practical 
       problem-solving, and the use of language appropriate for the target audience.

3.5    That national operators should use appropriate means, such as end-of-season 
       debriefings, to assess the effectiveness of training programmes. There should 
       also be debriefing of visitors who are not part of national programmes.

4. Education for Visitors to the Antarctic

Discussion in this session covered the general principles for educating all Antarctic 
visitors and the various codes of conduct that are currently used by Treaty Parties and by 
others such as tourist operators. Consideration was given to the merits of a certification 
scheme for authorising tourist operators or elements of their operations. The expectations 
and aspirations of tourists were discussed along with the range of experiences in providing 
education for tourist groups. Concern was expressed that some large groups of tourists, 
on tour ships for example, were not receiving adequate educational briefings or 
preparation. The role of EIAs for tour operations as an educational mechanism was 
viewed favourably.

Accordingly, the Workshop recommended:

4.1    That effective implementation of the rules of the Protocol for visitors to the 
       Antarctic would benefit from the availability and use of a layperson's guide to 
       the Protocol.

4.2    That COMNAP, in association with the International Association of Antarctic 
       Tour Operators (IAATO) and other interested parties, should compile a manual 
       or guidebook for use by tour operators and organisers of non-governmental 
       expeditions, as a prescribed code of conduct, which might cover among others: 
       environmental protection; flora and fauna protection; avoidance of disruption 
       to scientific research; minimising waste and pollution; respecting the rules 
       relating to specially protected areas; prohibition of collections and souveniring; 
       and encouraging safe operations.

5. Public Education

During a wide-ranging discussion, the workshop considered the principles and processes 
associated with public environmental education and the role of non-governmental 
organisations in educating the public about the Antarctic environment and in motivating 
the public to work towards resolution of Antarctic environmental issues. Particular 
attention was devoted to the role of film-makers in educating the public, particularly 
through various entertainment techniques and the part played by Antarctic visitor centres 
in public education. The role of museums in public education about Antarctica, based in 
particular on the South Georgia Whaling Museum was examined together with the needs 
of the print media forms such as newspapers and magazines, as well technical print 
material and various forms of non-commercial educational publications, including maps. 
Finally, the educational role of libraries and archives was discussed.

The Workshop recommended:

5.1    That, considering the continued growth of publication of relevant Antarctic 
       information, and the absence of Antarctic libraries in some Antarctic countries, 
       Treaty Parties should each establish a depository for published information and 
       ATS documentation in at least one library, and should ensure public access to 
       it.

5.2    That, considering the importance of providing visitors to the Antarctic with 
       authoritative and accessible information in a variety of forms and ensuring it is 
       available at points of departure for the Antarctic, and welcoming the 
       establishment of the International Antarctic Visitor
ortunities for Antarctic Environmental Education and Training

5.4     That, convinced of the need to maintain and extend public interest in Antarctica
        by production of informative and accessible works in all media, with special 
        attention given to popularisation of science and the workings of the Antarctic 
        Treaty System, national and international bodies (including SCAR, IUCN and 
        ASOC) should be encouraged to collaborate in producing material which fosters 
        public interest in and awareness of Antarctica.

5.5     That SCAR and IUCN should seek sponsorship to provide funding for a 
        regularly awarded prize for the best book about Antarctica written for a general 
        audience.

5.6     That SCAR and IUCN, convinced of the importance of television in improving 
        public awareness of Antarctic environmental management and conservation, 
        and aware that material currently produced by television companies may not 
        present a balanced picture, should seek sponsorship for production of a 
        television documentary and associated videos for broadcast and distribution.

ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING:
DRAFT INVENTORY OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS

Information Paper submitted to the XX ATCM

Agenda Item 15: Education and Training

Submitted by IUCN, The World Conservation Union's
Antarctic Advisory Committee, April 1996

I. BACKGROUND

1. The proceedings of the SCAR-IUCN Workshop on Environmental Education and Training,
Gorizia, Italy, April 1993, have now been published as Dingwall, P. and Walton, D. (eds.),
Opportunities for Antarctic Environmental Education and Training, Southern Polar Regions
Monograph No. 3, IUCN, Cambridge 1996. The principal recommendations are attached as
Appendix 1 of this Information Paper.

2. The report draws attention to a wide range of Antarctic environmental education and
training programs in various nations, but notes that amongst ATCPs there are no consistent
guidelines or curricula which would:

        (a) inform visitors about the Treaty System or indicate how to minimise human
impacts in Antarctica;

        (b) provide instruction for expedition staff about environmental monitoring or
environmental safeguards in Antarctica; or

        (c) help develop appropriate specialist training about environmental science or policy,
or the protected areas system in Antarctica.

3. Some Treaty nations do have excellent programs in these areas, but little information
exists as to needs or opportunities in other nations.

4. At XIX ATCM, the representative of the IUCN offered to approach the World
Conservation Union to see whether it would be willing to help develop a draft directory of those
Antarctic environmental education and training courses currently available.

5. The IUCN agreed that its Antarctic Advisory Committee should compile an inventory of
current education and training programs amongst Treaty participants. A first draft of this is
attached as Appendix 2.

6. To date, information has been received from the following countries: Australia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom, USA, Chile, Norway and South Africa. IUCN would encourage
Parties to forward current information to Professor Bruce Davis, at the address listed at the end 
of Appendix 2. A more complete listing will then be prepared for XXI ATCM.

7.  Attention is drawn to XIX ATCM Information Paper 62 and comments in the Final Report 
of XIX ATCM, Agenda Item 7(b)(6). Four proposals submitted by SCAR and IUCN were noted:

    (a)  the need for an inventory of environmental education and training programs;
    (b)  the value of a lay guide to the Protocol, which could be used for visitor and public 
         education;
    (c)  the designation of publicly accessible depository libraries for information on 
         Antarctica and the Protocol; and
    (d)  the need to include education and training on the agenda of all future ATCMs.

8.  Several delegations supported these suggestions, but no action decisions were taken. 
IUCN will undertake to consult with SCAR and COMNAP, and to report to the XXI ATCM on 
means they consider appropriate to facilitate and improve Antarctic education and training, 
especially for visitors and expeditionary staff. A specific action program and timescale should 
be specified, with clear performance indicators.

IUCN - The World Conservation Union

Founded in 1948, The World Conservation Union brings together States, government agencies 
and a diverse range of non-governmental organizations in a unique world partnership: over 842 
members in all, spread across some 132 countries.

As a Union, IUCN seeks to influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to 
conserve the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is 
equitable and ecologically sustainable. A central secretariat coordinates the IUCN Programme and 
serves the Union membership, representing their views on the world stage and providing them 
with the strategies, services, scientific knowledge and technical support they need to achieve their 
goals. Through its six Commissions, IUCN draws together over 6000 expert volunteers in project 
teams and action groups, focusing in particular on species and biodiversity conservation and the 
management of habitats and natural resources. The Union has helped many countries to prepare 
National Conservation Strategies, and demonstrates the application of its knowledge through the 
field projects it supervises. Operations are increasingly decentralized and are carried forward by 
an expanding network of regional and country offices, located principally in developing countries.

The World Conservation Union builds on the strengths of its members, networks and partners 
to enhance their capacity and to support global alliances to safeguard natural resources at local, 
regional and global levels.

SCAR - The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research

SCAR is a committee of ICSU, the International Council of Scientific Unions, and is charged with 
the initiation, promotion and co-ordination of scientific research in Antarctica.

It is the single multinational, multidisciplinary, non-governmental organization which draws on 
the experience and expertise of an international mix of specialists across the complete scientific 
spectrum to offer advice on a wide range of scientific questions and problems. Since its estab-
lishment in 1957 SCAR has provided such advice to the Antarctic Treaty System and made 
numerous recommendations on a diversity of matters, most of which have been incorporated into 
Antarctic Treaty instruments. Foremost among these has been advice for the many instruments 
concerning protection of the biota and environment of Antarctica.

Membership of SCAR comprises the National Committees of those national scientific acad-
emies which are adhering bodies to ICSU and which are, or plan to be, active in Antarctic research, 
together with the relevant Scientific Unions of ICSU. SCAR meets every two years to conduct its 
administrative business at the SCAR Delegates Meeting. The scientific business of SCAR is 
conducted by its Working Groups and Groups of Specialists. These represent the scientific 
disciplines active in Antarctic research. The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and 
Conservation (GOSEAC) is the multidisciplinary group most closely associated with providing 
advice to the Antarctic Treaty and was the SCAR co-sponsor with IUCN of the present Workshop.

Introduction

The specific purpose of the Workshop was to bring together people with experience in Antarctic science, conservation, education, training and communication in order to:

- exchange information on the subject of environmental education and training for those who work in or visit the Antarctic and Subantarctic regions;

- identify needs for advancing this subject;

- review and document the resources available; and

- make recommendations on future requirements and activities.

The objectives for achieving this were as follows:

- To examine the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and other legal instruments and policies, in terms of their implications for environmental education and training needs.

- To review and compile information on the resources and networks of people, organisations and institutions currently involved in environmental education and training in the Antarctic Region, and the potential for further developing these.

- To consider and make recommendations on the environmental education and training needs of scientists and their support staff, tourists, and others who visit the Antarctic Region.

To identify the opportunities for raising public awareness of the Antarctic and Subantarctic regions and their conservation.

Summary of Discussion and Recommendations

1.    Legal and Policy Issues

1.1  Antarctica

This session began with discussion of the obligations for environmental education and training required by the Antarctic Treaty System. It included an assessment of how effective the dissemination of information and training have been. It was noted that, while the Madrid Protocol includes requirements for information exchange among Treaty Parties and for making information available to a wider audience, the Protocol does not identify in a focused way the needs for education and training that are essential for its effective implementation.

Accordingly the Workshop recommended:

1.1.1  That the Treaty Parties, drawing upon the advice of SCAR, collaborate in the publication of a lay guide on the environmental protection obligations of the Protocol, and that they subsequently promote and distribute that guide to their Antarctic operators and to all who might visit the Antarctic.

1.1.2  That the Treaty Parties elaborate a comprehensive training programme to assist in the effective implementation of the Protocol, and that they include in the functions of the Committee for Environmental Protection advice on environmental education and training.

1.2  Subantarctic Region

The session reviewed environmental education policies and practices in place at Subantarctic islands, under national jurisdictions. It was noted that, despite the different juridical situations, some lessons from the Subantarctic islands may be valuable for the Antarctic. The usefulness of management plans as a tool for translating laws and policies into practical management objectives and actions was highlighted, as well as the further step of producing a guidebook to explain the objectives of management and their implications to visitors to the islands.

Accordingly, the Workshop recommended:

1.2.1  That a comprehensive bibliographic listing of all Subantarctic island management plans and related documents (entry permits, policy statements, etc.) be prepared as part of the Workshop proceedings.

1.2.2  That a list containing a representative selection of island educational and publicity materials including books, maps and films and their location and availability be included in the Workshop proceedings, if possible.

                                                                                                                               xvii

                                                                                                                               xi
1.2.3     That all appropriate national authorities be urged to develop environmental 
          education, training and public awareness policies and implementation 
          programmes as part of a Subantarctic island management planning process.

2.  Formal Education 

      This session first examined examples of higher education and training programmes in 
      Australasia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The increased 
      demand for such programmes consequent upon the Madrid Protocol requirements was 
      noted, as was the absence of any comprehensive survey of the needs and opportunities 
      for Antarctic environmental education and training. The experimental course at the 
      Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies, at the University of Tasmania in 
      Hobart, Australia, which is designed to provide training relating to obligations of the 
      Madrid Protocol, was seen as being particularly relevant. A comparative view was 
      presented for three Latin American states—Chile, Argentina and Brazil—and the value 
      of combining theoretical and practical studies (fieldwork) was stressed. Discussion also 
      included the importance of environmental education and training at primary and 
      secondary school levels.

      Accordingly the Workshop recommended:

      2.1     That, pursuant to Article 6.1(a) of the Protocol on Environmental Protection 
              which states, "Each Party shall endeavour to promote cooperative programmes 
              of scientific, technical and educational value, concerning the protection of the 
              Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems"; Antarctic 
              environmental education at a tertiary level should be undertaken nationally and 
              information passed to other countries through an agreed designated node, 
              institution or contact point.

      2.2     That Antarctic environmental education at a tertiary level should be recognised 
              by the Treaty Parties as an important subject for international exchange and 
              cooperation through studentships, staff exchange and information and resource 
              sharing.

              [Antarctica is the only instance where international continental-wide 
              environmental management can be applied and therefore this recommendation 
              is supported as encouraging the sharing of expertise and of providing appropriate 
              assistance to contribute towards the protection of the Antarctic environment and 
              its dependent and associated ecosystems and to ensuring that activities in the 
              Antarctic Treaty area do not have an adverse impact on the environment. This 
              recommendation will, by the process of international 'cross-fertilisation', assist 
              in the evolution of Antarctica as a special area of study not just in various 
              branches of science concerned with environmental education but also in other 
              learning and research fields such as in the legal/political and policy areas. 
              'Bilateral' exchanges in Antarctic environmental education are worth fostering 
              for all their potential benefits despite the problems of cost, language, cultural 
              differences, sovereignty, and the visa and exchange requirements that different 
              governments possess.]

2.3     That, recognising the importance of Antarctica in global environmental 
        processes, governments should have the goal of ensuring that present and future 
        generations are made aware of the significance of the Antarctic continent and 
        its dependent and associated ecosystems by incorporating, wherever possible, 
        teaching about these processes and these unique systems at all levels within 
        national educational systems.

2.4     That teaching about these processes and systems is coordinated by national 
        authorities within the relevant curricula for primary, secondary and tertiary 
        education so that the associated themes and issues and an understanding of the 
        systems and processes themselves is covered in a sequential manner.

        [Any coordination of Antarctic environmental education on a national basis at 
        the primary through to the tertiary level, by incorporation into existing curricula, 
        will also assist in the promotion of consistent standards as will those measures 
        associated with international exchange and cooperation in recommendation 2.2 
        above.]

2.5     That a comprehensive survey and documentation of Antarctic environmental 
        education be carried out by a university institution such as SPRI and/or IASOS. 
        This survey should include details about courses that are offered, their content 
        and duration as well as their approach (i.e. theoretical, practical or applied) and 
        to have this work completed by, for example, student(s) research topics. This 
        survey should also identify the range of needs at the post-school level and how 
        they are met by present courses that are both short and long term, academic and 
        practical, undergraduate and advanced, as well as those that offer training in the 
        form of refresher courses, or in teacher training and through 'training the 
        trainers' at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels.

        [Thus, a diversity of treatments can at present be identified as being necessary, 
        at a range of levels, from courses on waste management/cleaner production 
        techniques and technologies to environmental monitoring methodologies for the 
        effective implementation of the Madrid Protocol. The relationship of global 
        environmental issues and processes to national Antarctic policies and strategies 
        and how national environmental strategies are related to Antarctic 
        environmental issues
3. Education and Training for Scientists and Support Staff of National Programmes

Current experience from the national programmes of the United Kingdom, the United 
States of America, Australia and New Zealand was described. It was clear the great extent 
to which there were common practices involving the provision of relevant literature, the 
provision of general briefings for all personnel with specific briefings for smaller groups 
with specialised deployment needs, and an assessment of the effectiveness of training, 
using post-season debriefings. The workshop concluded that experiences should be 
shared among national programmes. Sanctions are needed for those transgressing 
environmental standards, so as to encourage wider understanding of regulations and it is 
vital that educational materials used are appropriate if they are to be effective. Emergency 
training is vitally important and some form of assessment of training effort is required to 
make sure the effort is cost effective.

Accordingly the Workshop recommended:

3.1     That proposed training methods from the Workshop be considered by 
COMNAP, with a view to promoting their implementation and the sharing of 
experiences of national programmes among national operators.

3.2     That where behaviour and activity is observed contrary to the Protocol 
(reflecting a lack of understanding of the Protocol's provisions) these should be 
reported to national operators and, if necessary, to other relevant authorities for 
appropriate action to be taken.

3.3     That appropriate hazard contingency training to address emergency response 
action for fire, oil spill, laboratory, field, ship and aircraft emergencies should 
be practised frequently by all relevant personnel.

3.4     That national programme training officers should consider making written 
material visually attractive, concise and informative; and should consider the 
introduction of video training aids, the use of theoretical and practical 
problem-solving, and the use of language appropriate for the target audience.

3.5     That national operators should use appropriate means, such as end-of-season 
debriefings, to assess the effectiveness of training programmes. There should 
also be debriefing of visitors who are not part of national programmes.

4. Education for Visitors to the Antarctic

Discussion in this session covered the general principles for educating all Antarctic 
visitors and the various codes of conduct that are currently used by Treaty Parties and by 
others such as tourist operators. Consideration was given to the merits of a certification 
scheme for authorising tourist operators or elements of their operations. The expectations 
and aspirations of tourists were discussed along with the range of experiences in providing 
education for tourist groups. Concern was expressed that some large groups of tourists, 
on tour ships for example, were not receiving adequate educational briefings or 
preparation. The role of EIAs for tour operations as an educational mechanism was 
viewed favourably.

                    Accordingly, the Workshop recommended:

4.1     That effective implementation of the rules of the Protocol for visitors to the 
Antarctic would benefit from the availability and use of a layperson's guide to 
the Protocol.

4.2     That COMNAP, in association with the International Association of Antarctic 
Tour Operators (IAATO) and other interested parties, should compile a manual 
or guidebook for use by tour operators and organisers of non-governmental 
expeditions, as a prescribed code of conduct, which might cover among others: 
environmental protection; flora and fauna protection; avoidance of disruption 
to scientific research; minimising waste and pollution; respecting the rules 
relating to specially protected areas; prohibition of collections and souvenir[?]
and encouraging safe operations.

5. Public Education

During a wide-ranging discussion, the workshop considered the principles and processes 
associated with public environmental education and the role of non-governmental 
organisations in educating the public about the Antarctic environment and in motivating 
the public to work towards resolution of Antarctic environmental issues. Particular 
attention was devoted to the role of film-makers in educating the public, particularly 
through various entertainment techniques and the part played by Antarctic visitor centres 
in public education. The role of museums in public education about Antarctica, based in 
particular on the South Georgia Whaling Museum was examined together with the needs 
of the print media forms such as newspapers and magazines, as well as technical print 
material and various forms of non-commercial educational publications, including maps. 
Finally, the educational role of libraries and archives was discussed.

The Workshop recommended:

5.1     That, considering the continued growth of publication of relevant Antarctic 
information, and the absence of Antarctic libraries in some Antarctic countries, 
Treaty Parties should each establish a depository for published information and 
ATS documentation in at least one library, and should ensure public access to 
it.

5.2     That, considering the importance of providing visitors to the Antarctic with 
authoritative and accessible information in a variety of forms and ensuring it is 
available at points of departure for the Antarctic, and welcoming the 
establishment of the International Antarctic Visitor Centre in New Zealand and 
the Whaling Museum on South Georgia, the Treaty Parties with suitable points
Opportunities for Antarctic Environmental Education and Training

5.4     That, convinced of the need to maintain and extend public interest in Antarctica by production of informative and accessible works in all media, with special 
        attention given to popularisation of science and the workings of the Antarctic 
        Treaty System, national and international bodies (including SCAR, IUCN and 
        ASOC) should be encouraged to collaborate in producing material which fosters 
        public interest in and awareness of Antarctica.

5.5     That SCAR and IUCN should seek sponsorship to provide funding for a 
        regularly awarded prize for the best book about Antarctica written for a general 
        audience.

5.6     That SCAR and IUCN, convinced of the importance of television in improving 
        public awareness of Antarctic environmental management and conservation, 
        and aware that material currently produced by television companies may not 
        present a balanced picture, should seek sponsorship for production of a 
        television documentary and associated videos for broadcast and distribution.
