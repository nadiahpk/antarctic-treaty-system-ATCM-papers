REPORT OF THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO) IN RELATION
TO ARTICLE 111 (2) OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Since XIX ATCM WMO activities in relation to Antarctica have been:

    The twelfth Congress of the World Meteorological 
    Organization (Cg XII) was held in Geneva in June 1995. In 
    relation to its Antarctic program Congress,
-   assessed that most of the planned targets in the WMO 
    Third Long Term Plan for Antarctica had been met and 
    adopted draft WMO Antarctic Activities for inclusion in 
    the Fourth Long Term Plan.
-   noted that the Executive Council WMO Working Group on 
    Antarctic Meteorology (EC-WGAM) had been reestablished 
    with revised terms of reference.
-   was pleased to note that the Antarctic Regional Basic 
    Synoptic Network (RBSN) had been expanded by inclusion 
    of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and Automatic 
    Geophysical Observatories and that an International 
    Programme for Antarctic Buoys had been established.
-   welcomed continued WMO contact with the International 
    Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and urged WMO 
    members to recruit tourist ships for the Voluntary 
    Observing Ships scheme.
-   noted again the deficiencies in the observing network 
    in Antarctica particularly over Western Antarctica and 
    delays in insertion of data into the telecommunication 
    system. It re-emphasised target times for reception of 
    Antarctic data.
-   requested the EC-WGAM to seek to coordinate the 
    deployment of new AWS and the maintenance of continuous 
    observations at existing stations.
-   welcomed the EC-WGAM Survey of Antarctic historical 
    data and the preparation of a data catalogue to assist 
    in the SCAR Antarctic Data Directory System.
-   encouraged WMO Members to expand ozone observations in 
    Antarctica and to provide the cobservations to the WMO 
    Global Watch Data Centres.  It also noted the 
    importance of maintaining close contact with the 
    Secretariats of the UN Framework on Climate Change, the 
    Montreal Protocol and the Vienna Convention for the 
    Protection of the Ozone Layer in relation to Antarctic 
    programs.

-    confirmed continued contact with appropriate 
     international groups dealing with Antarctic policy, 
     science and operations in particular ATCM, SCAR, COMNAP 
     and IOC noting particularly IOC and WMO participation 
     in the First Southern Ocean Forum.

     The WMO Executive Council Working Group on Antarctic 
     Meteorology [EC-WGAM] maintained work on network 
     development, the monitoring of the effectiveness of 
     Antarctic meteorological telecommunications, the development 
     of an annual reporting system and the development of a 
     catalogue of historical data.

     WMO has provided information papers for other relevant 
     agenda items of XX ATCM.
