REPORT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ANTARCTICA TOUR OPERATORS (IAATO)
PURSUANT TO ARTICLE III (2) OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

(Agenda Item 5b)

(Submitted by IAATO)
THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ANTARCTIC TOUR OPERATORS (IAATO)
is pleased to present a report of its activities to the
XX ATCM, Utrecht, Netherlands April 29 - May 10, 1996
pursuant to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty

1.  Introduction

1.1 Thirteen Antarctic tour operators based in the United States, Germany, Great 
Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are currently members of IAATO,
representing 100% of the companies that organized commercial land or ship-based
private-sector travel to the Antarctic in 1995-96. Directory attached. The annual
meeting of IAATO was held July 12-14, 1995 in Arlington, Virginia, U.S.A.

1.2 Recognizing the regular growth of Antarctic tourism and the need to monitor the
activities of its members, IAATO adopted two new categories of membership at its
July 1995 meeting: Provisional and Probationary. Provisional membership is
reserved for new operators; Probationary membership is reserved for past or
current members who the full membership decides has not fully met with IAATO
objectives and expectations. Members in these new categories are subject to a
thorough review of their operations and must carry IAATO-approved observers.

1.3 IAATO was founded by seven companies in 1991 to advocate, promote and
practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to Antarctica.

1.4 IAATO is committed to operate within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty,
Environmental Protocol, relevant national legislation and other international

IAATO ANNUAL REPORT          - 2-
agreements. IAATO member companies urge ratification of the Protocol and 
continue, as far as possible, to operate as though the Protocol is in place.

1.5   IAATO members value the opportunity to participate at this Antarctic Treaty 
meeting and other international venues. Formal and informal liaison with national 
Antarctic programs is an important objective of IAATO and its members. Since the 
XIX ATCM in Seoul, April 1995, IAATO representatives attended or participated 
in a number of meetings and workshops, including the July 10-12, 1995 workshop, 
Managing the Antarctic Environment, at Byrd Polar Research Center (Columbus, 
Ohio, U.S.A.) and the NSF/COMNAP Tour Operators Meeting at NSF 
Headquarters, July 13, 1995. Fifty participants involved in Antarctic tourism, 
science, logistics and policy attended this seventh annual meeting.

1.6   IAATO members strongly believe that responsible tourism, properly managed, is 
an important and legitimate human activity in Antarctica. A primary objective of 
IAATO is to create a corps of ambassadors for the continued protection of 
Antarctica. Greater awareness of the aesthetic, wilderness and scientific values of 
Antarctica is achieved through first hand experience and its educational programs.

1.7   The largest number of travelers ever visited Antarctica in the 1995-96, reflecting a 
rising trend over the last five seasons during which more than 7,000 people have 
visited. Since 1966, more than 75,000 people have done so.

IAATO ANNUAL REPORT                                 - 3-
2. Field Coordination

IAATO compiled and distributed Vessel Call Data in November 1995 as part of 
its annual operational information exchange (attached to this report). Also, a radio 
schedule was instituted for expedition leaders to communicate more easily. An 

IAATO objective is to facilitate communication in the field as a means to exchange 
general information, coordinate visits to individual sites and increase the probability 
of effective response in case of emergency.

3. Environmental Assessment and Monitoring

Anticipating ratification of the Environmental Protocol and its call for 
environmental assessment, a number of members have conducting Environmental 
Audits or Initial Environmental Assessments of their Antarctic operations. Several 
IEEs have been filed by IAATO members since the XIX ATCM (Seoul, May 
1995), including Orient Line for its four 1995-96 Antarctic cruises aboard the 

Marco Polo, Southern Heritage Expeditions for its three Akademik Shokalski 
voyages, Adventure Consultants for its Vinson Massif Mount Tyree supported by 
Adventure Network International and the joint Russian Antarctic Expedition-View 
Foundation project at Bellingshausen station. In addition, GMMS PTY submitted a 
Preliminary Assessment of Environmental Impacts for its Expedition for Climbers 
and Photographers to the Antarctic Peninsula, January 1996 to the Australian 
government, which was authorized. Environmental information was included in the 
New Zealand and Australian applications filed by Quark Expeditions for its 
operations in the Ross Sea, Macquarie and New Zealand Subantarctic islands.

4. Reporting of Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities

4.1 IAATO members welcome XIX Resolution 3 (1995), which lists the information 
that should be included in post season reporting. Accurate reporting is an important 
step in assessing the scope and intensity of human activities, including tourism.

4.2 IAATO members currently file Advance Notification and Post Season Reports to 
an appropriate national authority (Recommendation VIII-9, Annex C).

4.3 IAATO endorses the content of the form included in the New Zealand legislation. 
A number of national programs and non-governmental organizations, however, are 
distributing versions of such a report asking for substantially similar information.

4.4 IAATO proposes to collaborate with the U.S. National Science Foundation and 
other interested parties on an industry-wide form, which addresses anticipated 
requirements imposed by national legislation related to the Environmental Protocol. 
A single form would facilitate the collection and compilation of uniform data on 
activities and reduce the burden on operators of duplicate reporting. This form 
could be developed using a data base and distributed by the IAATO Secretariat on 
disk, a move toward making data more accessible to Treaty Parties.

4.5 IAATO members feel strongly that they should not be asked to make assessments 
beyond the limitations of time and the training of their field staff nor to report on 
information more already available elsewhere.

IAATO ANNUAL REPORT                                 - 5 -
4.6     IAATO members support an appropriate standard format for additional reporting of 
        human activities, including tourism, which will contribute to an ongoing monitoring 
        program. The reporting burden, however, should be no greater for tourist activities 
        than other human activities in the Antarctic. Members have participated in an 
        IAATO initiative to identify and assess the most heavily visited, critical sites.

5.      Education and Training

5.1     Lecture program
        A key component of all IAATO activities in the Antarctic is education. All 
        programs carry a team of lecturers, who enhance the firsthand experience on the 
        continent and contribute to public awareness of Antarctic science. Many of these 
        lecturers have extensive experience in Antarctic science and logistics as participants 
        in national Antarctic Research Programs.

5.2     Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1

        (a)     IAATO distributed to its members copies of Recommendation XVIII-1, 
                Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic and Guidance for Those Organising 
                and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental Activities in the Antarctic in 
                six languages. It was included in all onboard briefings.

        (b)     A draft slide presentation reinforcing Recommendation XVIII-1 is available 
                from the Secretariat. This slide presentation will be used by expedition 
                leaders in the field as a tool for briefing passengers and crew.

5.3     Publications

The Office of the Secretariat publishes IAATO News, a regular newsletter 
containing reports on Antarctic tourism, the Antarctic Treaty System and other 
topics relevant to its members, field staff and passengers. It has also published its 
Bylaws, Membership Directory, Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic and 
Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and Non-governmental 
Activities in the Antarctic. To receive copies of these publications or be added to 
IAATO's mailing list, please contact the Secretariat (address attached).

5.4     Virtual Antarctica

IAATO Member Mountain Travel-Sobek sponsored Virtual Antarctica, a site on 
the world wide web with detailed Antarctic information, video and live satellite 
feeds from a voyage to Antarctica aboard the Livonia.

5.5     Medical Information

IAATO is instituting an industry-wide Medical Information form, intended to help 
travelers assess their fitness for an Antarctic expedition and educate them about the 
serious health risk involved. It will also enable members to refuse passengers who 
might pose a serious health risk. This form reinforces and standardizes the 
questionnaires and information that is already being distributed to passengers by 
member companies. See XX ATCM Information paper for the draft form.

5.6     Expedition Leader's Handbook/Resource Book

Each IAATO member has an environmental officer and manager of field 
operations, who is responsible for communicating the obligations of the Antarctic 
Treaty System to its field staff. Most of these individuals have been active in 
Antarctica for decades. They are responsible for the Handbook for Expedition 
Leaders. Such handbooks contain Antarctic Treaty System documents, briefing and 
safety, guidelines, procedures, emergency contingency plans and information on 
landing sites. IAATO has tabled an outline of an Expedition Leader's Handbook as 
an information paper at the XX ATCM.

6.      Contingency Planning

6.1     Medical Emergency Contingency

Recognizing the need for self-sufficiency and standard procedures in the event of a 
medical emergency, IAATO is designating the Adventure Network International 
office in Punta Arenas as a 24-hour Emergency Station. A draft Medical 
Emergency Contingency Plan developed by ANI is being circulated as an 
information paper at the XX ATCM.

6.2     Oil Pollution Emergency

(a)     While individual Antarctic tour vessels carry Shipboard Oil Pollution 
Emergency Plans (SOPEP) that fulfill MARPOL requirements (Annex I, 
Regulation 26), IAATO is consulting with several private companies 
regarding an industry-wide plan specific to Antarctic operations.

IAATO ANNUAL REPORT                                                    - 8 -
(b)     A number of tour vessels carry limited containment equipment and each has 
       instituted fuel handling procedures. Regular training and plans are 
       requirements of international certification.

6.3    Marine Emergency Preparedness and Response

(a)     IAATO-member Antarctic tour vessels maintain regular communication, a 
       key to effective response in case of accident or marine incident.

(b)     While recognizing that the risk of incident increases with more tour vessels 
       in operation, so does the likelihood that another tour vessel will respond to 
       an emergency. Formal emergency response procedures and a survey of 
       training procedures is being discussed by IAATO.

(c)     Most of the 15 Antarctic tour vessels that operated during the 1995-96 
       season were purpose built for polar operations, commanded by officers and 
       crew with extensive experience in polar regions.

6.4    Weather emergency

(a)     A number of operators in recent years have instituted the use of survival 
       gear and other emergency equipment during their landing operations. This 
       is especially true of those that operate in the Ross Sea or other areas outside 
       the Antarctic Peninsula. An industry-wide review of emergency equipment 
       and procedures is in process.

IAATO ANNUAL REPORT                                                    - 9 -
(b) IAATO members are encouraged to educate their passengers as to the real 
dangers of the Antarctic environment and to ensure that their passengers are 
equipped for an extended stay ashore in case of a weather emergency.

7. Inspection Checklist (Article VII-3, Antarctic Treaty)

IAATO members welcome the guidance offered by Resolution 5 (1995) regarding 
inspection of vessels within the Antarctic Treaty Area. Eight of 15 IAATO vessels 
fly a flag of an Antarctic Treaty Party (Russia) and tour vessels of other flags have 
consented to Article V11-3 inspections. None were conducted in 1995-96.

8. The Antarctic Protected Area System

IAATO members note and share the concern on the part of some Treaty Parties 
about tourist and other non-governmental activities in proposed Antarctic Specially 
Managed Areas. IAATO urges that its representatives be included in formal 
consultation with operators on developing management plans for key sites.

9. 1995-96 Scientific and Environmental Research Initiatives

IAATO member companies continued to provide logistic and scientific support to 
national Antarctic programs and Antarctic organizations in 1995-96. Members see 
themselves as a resource for science and welcome the opportunity to assist.

Antarctic travelers benefit from the exposure to science and scientists and most 
projects cause minimal disruption to tour schedules.

IAATO ANNUAL REPORT                                 - 10 -
9.1 In a cooperative venture with the Russian Antarctic Expedition, travelers 
participated in a program sponsored by the VIEW Foundation and Marine 
Expeditions which helped to clear and retrograde waste metal and debris from 
Bellingshausen Station. A total of some 55 volunteers involved in the project lived 
and worked at the station in small groups from December 1995 to March 1996.

9.2 IAATO members supported the Humpback Whale Catalog by providing fluke 
identification photos to Allied Whale, College of the Atlantic, Bar Harbor, Maine.

9.3 IAATO vessels transported over 100 scientists and support personnel during the 
1995-96 season for a number of national program, including the Alfred Wegener 
Institute, Arctowski Station, U.S. National Science Foundation, British Sea 
Mammal Research Unit and the Italian Antarctic Research Program. In addition, 
researchers with the Scott Polar Research Institute team and Antarctic Site 
Inventory and Monitoring Program team traveled on IAATO ships.

9.4 National Antarctic program personnel from Palmer Station and Macquarie Island 
were evacuated to port for medical attention by the _Professor Khromov_ (Quark 
Expeditions) and _Akademik Shokalski_ (Southern Heritage expeditions). IAATO 
extends special thanks to the men of Neumeyer Station for assistance rendered this 
season to the passengers on the ice at the Atka Bay emperor penguin rookery.

9.5 On three of its voyages, Marine Expeditions transported scientists and personnel,
conducted Zodiac training and carried supplies for the Ukrainian Antarctic Program
at the former Faraday Station. It also carried building supplies for Brown Station.

9.6 In addition to support for science programs, tour operators and passengers
continued their tradition of direct financial contributions to organizations active in
Antarctica, including the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, New Zealand Antarctic
Heritage Trust, Humpback Whale Identification Project and the South Georgia
Whaling Museum.

10. International Scientific and Logistic Support

Recognizing that Antarctic science is expensive and that tourism has been an
underutilized resource, IAATO calls for proposals by Antarctic national programs,
Antarctic organizations and individual researchers. In general, support is provided
at minimal cost to research. Proposals for collaborative projects may be made to
individual companies or through the IAATO secretariat.

IAATO members are prepared to provide support on a number of levels, including:
(1) transporting scientists, support personnel and equipment; (2) conducting surveys
and research following standard protocols; (3) carrying scientists who engage in
research aboard tour ships and installing remote surveying equipment aboard; (4)
providing navigational information to IHO relevant for use on navigational charts;
(5) supplying detailed information on individual landing sites.
