INSPECTIONS UNDER THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

REF.: Item 10 of the Provisional Agenda of the XX ATCM ( Information Paper )

Brazil only made an inspection in 1990, and none has been programed for
1996-1997.

The last inspection which the Antarctic Station "Comandante Ferraz" (EACF)
under-went, occured in 1993, and it was conducted by the United Kingdom, Italy and
the Republic of Korea. In this summer of 1995/96, there was no inspection in EACF.

The inspection lists, already approved by ATCM, which are to be applied in
permanent stations, vessels, abandoned stations and waste disposal sites are considered
to be of major importance by the Brazilian Antartic Program (PROANTAR). It is
understood that these are guidelines and not mandatory. Actually, they are being used
by PROANTAR, serving as an auto-evaluation for the EACF and for the
Oceanographic and Supply Ship (NApOc) "Ary Rongel".

The PROANTAR knows that inspections are of great importance and serve, in
the first instance, for the program inspected, which has the opportunity to correct its
own faults; and, in the second instance, they serve the inspector, who has contact
with the equipments, systems, technics, and inspected behaviour. Finally, the
inspections serve all those who receive the information contained in the reports, and
those who can compare the report with their own situation, and, if it be the case, can
correct undesired aspects  of their own program.
