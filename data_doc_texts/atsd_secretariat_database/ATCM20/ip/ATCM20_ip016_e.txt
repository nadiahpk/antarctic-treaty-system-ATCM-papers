In September 1994, true to the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty,
France and New Zealand signed a cooperation agreement related to
Antarctica. International scientific cooperation and information
exchange on current programs are among some of the major
recommendations of the Treaty. SCAR and COMNAP have suggested the
establishment of a joint task group on data management which would
be entrusted with the development of an international Antarctica
Master Directory (AMD). An invitation to tender has been made so
that agencies concerned can make proposals dealing with the
collection of data, the hosting and management of the Directory,
and the dissemination of information. Like some other countries,
France has given its support to the bid made by the International
Centre for Antarctic Research (ICAIR) in New Zealand to host this
Directory. In July 1995, SCAR and COMNAP decided to take up
ICAIR's bid. Thus, ICAIR is now responsible for putting together
the Directory through the AMD Consortium which consists of ICAIR as
well as the countries involved in the implementation of this
project. Such has thus been the starting point of an enhanced
cooperation between ICAIR and the French Institute for Polar
Research and Technology (IFRTP).

True to her commitments, France takes now part in the financing of
the Antarctic Master Directory. However, French support is not
only an economic one. Anxious to be more active, France has indeed
undertaken with the financial help of its Ministry of Foreign
Affairs staff exchanges between the two institutes, that is ICAIR
and IFRTP.

As the agency hosting the Antarctic Master Directory, ICAIR is now
responsible for the coordination of all National Antarctic Data
Centres as well as for the collection, control, storage and
dissemination of data base profiles. To make those tasks easier
and more secure, it is essential to develop an information tool
allowing scientists from the different countries involved to
profile the data bases they have been able to set up, whatever
their scientific subject matter may be.

The development of such an information tool has been the focus of
the first part of staff exchanges. It is within this framework
that, during a five week long stay, an ICAIR expert engineer has
been able to develop at IFRTP headquarters in Brest the first
version of that tool. Through various meetings, IFRTP was able to
give its opinion as a National Antarctic Data Centre or to give
advice on the design and carrying out of such a tool.

As future users of that tool, some French scienti[?]sts have also had
the opportunity to give their opinion on this first version.
Furthermore, the IFRTP Scientific Council has recommended to the
French scientists that they describe the Antarctica data bases they
manage in their laboratories.

The second part of the staff exchange will take place in April/May 
1996, with an IFRTP engineer staying this time at ICAIR.

ICAIR/IFRTP cooperation will no doubt benefit all countries 
involved in Antarctica. The user-friendly access to the Directory 
through Internet for instance will permit not only the enhancement 
of research already undertaken in Antarctica but also to initiate 
new forms of cooperation among scientists while promoting talks and 
exchanges.
