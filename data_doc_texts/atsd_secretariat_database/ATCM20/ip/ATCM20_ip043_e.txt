to the Antarctic Treaty,

Liability for Emergency Response Action

(Agenda Item 6B)

(Submitted by the United States)

PROPOSAL OF THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION

Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection
to the Antarctic Treaty
Liability for Emergency Response Action

Article 1
Purpose

The purpose of this Annex is to promote the prevention, minimization and containment of damage to the Antarctic environment or dependent and associated ecosystems and to provide for compensation for costs arising out of a Party's failure to fulfill its obligations under Article 15 of the Protocol to provide for prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies. This Annex does not preclude the possibility of developing additional Annexes on liability for damage as the Parties deem appropriate, nor does it preclude liability that might otherwise arise under international law.

Article 2
Definitions

For the purpose of this Annex only, the following terms have the following meanings:

1. "Response action" means reasonable measures to prevent, minimize or contain damage caused by environmental emergencies, including determining the extent of the emergency.

2. "Reasonable" includes objective criteria such as risk to the environment, the rate of natural recovery of the environment, risk to human life and safety, technological and economic feasibility, practicability and proportionality.

3. "Environmental emergencies" includes all unplanned or accidental events, whether or not assessed in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol, that result in, or imminently threaten to result in, any significant and harmful impact on the Antarctic environment or associated and dependent ecosystems.

Article 3
Obligations of Parties

1. In accordance with Article 15 of the Protocol, 
Parties to this Annex agree to:

a. provide for prompt and effective response 
action to environmental emergencies which 
might arise in the performance of scientific 
research programs, tourism and all other 
governmental and non-governmental activities 
in the Antarctic Treaty area for which 
advance notice is required under Article VII 
(5) of the Antarctic Treaty, including 
associated logistic support activities, by, 
inter alia:

      i. with respect to non-governmental 
activities, implementing measures that 
will ensure that those undertaking such 
activities are financially accountable 
for failing to take prompt and 
effective response action in order to 
allow the Party which provided for such 
response action or, if no response 
action was taken, the Environmental 
Fund described in Article 11, to be 
compensated; and

     ii. with respect to governmental 
activities, ensuring that prompt and 
effective response action is taken;

b. establish contingency plans for response 
to incidents with potential adverse effects 
on the Antarctic environment or dependent 
and associated ecosystems;

c. co-operate in the formulation and 
implementation of such contingency plans; and

d. establish procedures for immediate 
notification of, and co-operative response 
to environmental emergencies.

2. Parties shall take appropriate measures within 
their competence, as set forth in Article 13 of 
the Protocol to ensure compliance with the 
obligations set forth in paragraph 1. Parties 
shall also take into account relevant guidance 
provided by expert groups established under the 
Antarctic Treaty system, such as SCALOP and 
COMNAP.

Article 4
Liability

1. Except as provided in Article 7, failure of a 
Party to fulfill its obligations in Article 3 (1)
(a) shall entail strict liability and 
compensation in accordance with Article 6.

2. Without prejudice to the liability of a Party 
under Paragraph 1 for its failure to provide for 
prompt and effective response action to 
environmental emergencies caused by its warships, 
naval auxiliaries, or other ships owned or 
operated by it and used, for the time being, only 
on government non-commercial service, those 
vessels of the Parties shall be immune in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 11(1) 
to (3) of Annex IV to the Protocol.

Article 5
Response Action

1. If response action as described in Article 3 
(1) (a) does not occur, other Parties are 
encouraged, while not obligated, to provide for 
response action.

2. In all cases in which a Party provides for 
response action, that Party shall endeavor to 
consult and to coordinate its action with all 
affected Parties to the extent feasible.

Article 6
Measurement of Damages and Compensation

In the event of liability pursuant to Article 4:

1. The liable Party shall be responsible for 
paying the costs of response action provided for 
by other Parties and undertaken pursuant to 
Article 5 (1). Such payment shall be made to the 
Party or Parties providing for the response 
action.

2. The liable Party shall be responsible for 
paying the costs of response action that should 
have been undertaken, but was not. Such payment 
shall be made to the Environmental Fund described 
in Article 11.

Article 7
Exemptions from Liability

A Party shall not be liable pursuant to Article 4
if the failure to fulfill its obligations under
Article 3 (1) (a) was caused by:

1. An act necessary to protect human life or
safety; or

2. An event constituting in the circumstances of
Antarctica a natural disaster that would make
fulfilling such obligations unreasonable.

      b. environmental clean-up in Antarctica or dependent and associated ecosystems; or

      c. other purposes in furtherance of the Protocol.
