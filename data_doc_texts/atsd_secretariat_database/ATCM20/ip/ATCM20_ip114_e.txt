ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING WORKSHOPS

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING WORKSHOPS

Information Paper submitted to XX ATCM by SCAR and COMNAP

Agenda item 22

In 1994 the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (XVIII ATCM) requested that SCAR and COMNAP jointly convene technical workshops to provide expert advice on the design and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes in the Antarctic. The Terms of Reference were defined at that meeting.

Because of the scope and complexity of the subject it was decided to hold two linked workshops. The first workshop was tasked to develop options for monitoring impacts from human activities, based on the list of activities defined by the Group of Experts Meeting in Buenos Aires. The second workshop was required to examine these options and provide a more detailed technical evaluation of feasibility, methodologies and available technology.

The first workshop was held in Oslo, Norway in November 1995. It was attended by 50 participants from 18 countries. The second workshop was held in College Station, USA in March 1996. It was attended by 79 participants from 19 countries. The financial and resource support for the workshops was provided by SCAR, COMNAP, National Science Foundation, Norsk Polar Institutt, Norwegian State Pollution Board, and Texas A&M University.

Very significant progress was made with all the major terms of reference. A draft report is in preparation at present and will be considered by SCAR and COMNAP during August 1996 in Cambridge, United Kingdom. A working paper with recommendations will be provided to XXI ATCM in Christchurch, New Zealand, together with detailed supporting documentation as Information Papers.
