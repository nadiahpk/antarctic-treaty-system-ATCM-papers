PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BULGARIAN ANTARCTIC ACTIVITIES

AND

ANTARCTICA
I. INTRODUCTION

The Republic of Bulgaria ascended to the Antarctic treaty in 
1978, and thus became the twentieth contracting Party because 
of its firm conviction that Antarctica will for ever be used 
exclusively for peaceful purposes and that international 
cooperation on the basis of freedom and scientific investigation 
in Antarctica will continue in the interests of all mankind. As a 
member of the Treaty Bulgaria aims to contribute towards the 
active and continuous development of scientific knowledge of 
the area covered by the treaty.

Antarctica is the only continent still largely unexplored. Its 
geographic position and physical features, distance from 
sources of pollution and the little human activity make it a 
special area from which to gain an insight into the entire planet. 
Antarctica is without doubt Nature's largest laboratory on 
Earth. The scope of Antarctic research goes beyond an 
understanding of the natural processes that occur in high 
latitudes in relation to their extreme climatology. Its study 
reveals planetary phenomena whose origin lies in the Antarctic 
zone. Recent scientific research has stressed the role of the 
Continent and its surrounding oceans in the maintenance and 
stability of the biosphere.

We are well aware that Bulgaria is at the beginning of a serious 
involvement in Antarctic research.  Nevertheless, we are 
convinced that Antarctica is a unique continent of international 
harmony and freedom and as such needs even the most modest 
contributions to scientific progress in its study.

II. PAST BULGARIAN ANTARCTIC ACTIVITIES

Bulgaria started its Antarctic activities as early as 1967-1969,
when a Bulgarian meteorologist took part in the 13th Soviet
Antarctic Expedition. In the summer season of 1987-88, six
Bulgarian scientists participated in joint projects with the
British Antarctic Survey and the Soviet Institute for Antarctic
and Arctic Research. This Bulgarian programme was aimed at
gathering valuable experience both in carrying out scientific
research and in the organization of logistics in Antarctica.

During this Antarctic season a refuge was established on
Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands) on a spot located on
the North-East side of the South Bay.

III. PRESENT ACTIVITIES

In the period 1993-1996 Bulgaria organized three successive
Antarctic campaigns. A summer base was established and a
systematic collection of data and samples in various research
fields was initialized.

During the 1993-94 Antarctic summer campaign the Bulgarian
refuge on Livingston Island was reconstructed and put into
operation as a summer base. The base was named "St. Kliment
Ochridski" by an official Act of the President of the Republic
of Bulgaria. Ecological hazards caused by the five-year
interruption of the activities in the refuge were removed during
this campaign. The scientific programme included studies in
the fields of geology, meteorology, glaciology and human
medicine.

                                                                                  2
In the summer of 1994-95 the third Bulgarian Antarctic Campaign took place. The scope of the Bulgarian scientific programme was broadened and new research projects in the field of biology were initialized, together with the continuing geological, glaciological and meteorological studies. Scientific collaboration has been established with the Argentinean Antarctic Institute. A joint geological project was carried out and a Bulgarian geologist was logistically supported to work in the Argentinean field camp on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island.

In 1994 the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute presented an application for associate membership to SCAR. On March 5, 1995 Bulgaria became an associate member of this most important scientific coordinating body.

In the austral summer 1995-96 the Fourth Bulgarian Antarctic expedition took place. The National Antarctic Research Programme accepted and financed by the Bulgarian National Fund for Scientific Research was broadened. The programme is multidisciplinary in approach and includes several research projects in the field of biology, geology, glaciology, meteorology, physics and human medicine which investigate problems of present interest for today's Antarctic science.

A new living complex with a scientific laboratory was transported to the Bulgarian base during the season 1995-96.

In their present activities the Bulgarian Antarctic Programme operates in close cooperation with the Spanish Antarctic Programme.

IV. FUTURE ACTIVITIES

Bulgaria plans to continue and intensify its Antarctic research 
programme in the forthcoming years. The Bulgarian National 
Programme for Antarctic Research is the framework for the 
organization and coordination of future Antarctic campaigns. 
The programme is guided by the Bulgarian National Fund for 
Antarctic Research. The Bulgarian Antarctic Institute is in 
charge of creating the logistics required for scientists to carry 
out their research projects under the best possible conditions.

During the 1996-97 Antarctic campaign the new living 
complex with the scientific laboratory will be put into 
operation. The base is designed to shelter a total staff of 12 
persons. In the forthcoming season the base will be able to 
accept guest-scientists and could be used permanently if 
necessary. Research will continue to be initially limited to the 
Livingston Island. However, some scientists will carry out 
their work aboard vessels or at bases and field camps belonging 
to other nations within the framework of international scientific 
programmes. An international project for ice-core drilling on 
Livingston Island is in preparation. A suitable drilling site has 
been suggested in the close vicinity of both the Bulgarian base 
"St. Kliment Ochridski" and the Spanish base "Juan Carlos I". 
Within the biological research programme a joint Bulgarian-
Spanish project to study the effects of parasitism on penguin 
reproductive success is under consideration.  A Bulgarian 
glaciologist is planned to work at King George Island together 
with Brazilian glaciologists.

V. VISITS AND MEETINGS IN BULGARIA

In April 1995 the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute organized the 
first Spanish-Bulgarian Workshop on Antarctic Research. The 
aim of the workshop was to coordinate the 1995-96 Antarctic
                                                               4
campaign and to discuss scientific projects of common interest.
From the Spanish side in the meeting took part Dr. Juan Ramon
Vericad, Manager of the Spanish Antarctic Programme and Dr.
Alberto Castejon, Base Commander of the Spanish base "Juan
Carlos I".

In September 1995 the Logistic Manager of the Russian
Antarctic Programme Dr. Valery Lukin visited Bulgaria for
discussions on possible future cooperation.

VI PLANNING, MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION OF
SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA.
INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED

The present Bulgarian scientific activities in Antarctica have
been shared by several institutions.

The Bulgarian National Fund for Scientific Research at the
Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is responsible
for the realization and financing of the scientific projects
included in the National Antarctic Programme.

The National Committee for Antarctic Research is the national
coordinating body responsible for relations with SCAR.

The Bulgarian Antarctic Institute organizes annual Antarctic
expeditions and operates the Bulgarian Antarctic base "St.
Kliment Ohridski". The Antarctic activities are planned by the
Executive Council on recommendation by the Scientific Board
of the Institute. The State is represented on the Executive
Council by the Vice Foreign Minister. The Antarctic Institute
carries out its activities under the aegis of the President of
Bulgaria.
VII. SCIENTIFIC PROJECTS

The scientific projects are part of the long-standing National
