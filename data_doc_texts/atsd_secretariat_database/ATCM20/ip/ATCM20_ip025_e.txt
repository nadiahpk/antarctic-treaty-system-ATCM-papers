INTRODUCTION

At the XIVth ATCM in 1987 representatives discussed their growing concerns over the lack of
measures to ensure aviation safety, even though the volume and density of air traffic in Antarctia
were known to be very low in comparison with the rest of the world. A Meeting of Experts n
Paris in May 1989, confirmed these concerns. At the XVth ATCM held in 1989, Recommendat:on
XV-20 was passed to address the problem. The Council of Managers of National Antarc:ic
Programs (COMNAP) assigned to the Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operatio:s
(SCALOP) the implementation of Recommendation XV-20.

The specific item of weather and sea ice information services for marine navigation was al:o
raised at the XIV ATCM in 1987. It was referred to SCAR which organised a jo:nt
SCAR/WMO/IOC expert meeting held in Leningrad in 1989. The WMO view conveyed to XVI
ATCM in 1991 was essentially that:
    A need exists for high-quality comprehensive meteorological services for the safety and
    efficiency of operational and research activities in the Antarctic;
    Several meteorological forecast centres would be required on the continent and :ie
    neighbouring sea areas to meet the existing requirements for detailed services for limit=d
    areas and forecasts for particular local meteorological conditions;
    These meteorological forecast centres must have:
    -   Access to relevant Antarctic data and to products transmitted over the GTS;
    -   Adequate comnunication facilities;
    -   The ability to receive high-resolution data transmitted from satellites;
    In view of the difficulties of maintaining staff and equipment in the Antarctic, there is no
    current need to establish a global data-processing system on the continent. Support for
    the meteorological forecast centres could be arranged by WMO through existing cent::s.

OVERVIEW

The National Operator of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) is
the Australian Antarctic Division. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, with assistance from
the Australian Antarctic Division, established an Antarctic Meteorological Centre (AMC) at Casey
in December 1991, thus paving the way for a progressive improvement in provision of
meteorological services for air operations and shipping. The cornerstone of the operations of the
Australian Antarctic Meteorological Centre is the High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT)
facility from which Advanced High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data at 1 km resolution are
obtained. All five channels of the AVHRR data from the latest two NOAA satellites are archived
all year round at Casey. Casey AMC is equipped with satellite communication links to the
National Meteorological and Operational Centre (NMOC) in Melbourne and its super comput:rs.
A spur line in the communications network allows the Tasmania Regional Forecasting Centre to
act as a back up for the AMC at Casey, if necessary. The Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre
(BMRC) works closely with NMOC to develop operational numerical weather predic:ion
products for Antarctica which can be used at the Casey AMC.

        (including the sub Antarctic Macquarie Island).
        NOAA HRPT ground station.
        Routine archival of HRPT data stream throughout the year for research purposes.
        NOAA APT ground station at the secondary weather service office.
        Online access to global models of the atmosphere.
        Meteorologists rostered for 24 hours coverage, if necessary, during summer.
        Weather service to aviation on request.
        Routine HF radio fax broadcast of high seas forecasts.
        Weather service to shipping on request.
        Sea ice imagery and analysis services broadcast and available on request.

shipping season. A list of 10 or so standard products will be made available on the World Wide 
Web that can be down loaded by anyone with telephone access via INMARSAT.

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN AMC

Satellite Imagery

The first AVHRR images were received at Casey in February 1991. It represented a major step 
forward in Australia's meteorological forecasting capability in Antarctica and provided the basis 
for Casey being recognised as an Antarctic Meteorological Centre. High resolution pictures from 
NOAA polar orbiting satellites covering an area within a radius of approximately 3,500 km from 
Casey are received at the AMC, (see Figure 1).

HRPT data received at the Casey Meteorological Centre, are transmitted in real time via a high 
speed data link to our National Meteorological and Operational Centre in Melbourne for 
operational purposes. HRPT data are also archived on Exabyte tapes for transport each summer 
to Hobart and Melbourne where data bases are stored. Ready access to the tapes is provided to 
Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre, CSIRO Office of Space Science & Applications and 
other researchers.

The computers used by the HRPT ground station at Casey are more than 5 years old and have 
been in continuous use. The Bureau of Meteorology plans to replace the computers with UNIX 
based HP equipment. Three HP 715/64's with DAT archive drives have been purchased and the 
ingest software is currently being rewritten. The new system is to be installed in the summer of 
1996/97. The new system will offer the following improved features:

(1) Improved reliability and backup. Only one machine is required for the ingest and all 
ancillary processing. The other two will provide backup, with one available for summer
4

research, and special processing, etc.;
(2)  Data will be available sooner (order of 20 minutes after each satellite pass) for weather 
and ice analysis.
(3)  The DAT archive tapes will contain more data (4 Gbytes), they can be processed more 
quickly, and require fewer tapes and tape changes.

Global Numerical Weather Prediction Models

Antarctica plays a unique role in the environment of our planet. Its icecap and surrounding sea 
ice have a profound influence on the weather and climate, particularly of the Southern 
Hemisphere. Increasingly, data are becoming available from land-based Automatic Weather 
Stations, drifting buoys and remote sensing via radiometers on polar orbiting and geostationary 
meteorological satellites. Improvements in the efficiency of the Global Telecommunications 
System (GTS) and the development of more sophisticated data assimilation has led to significantly 
improved skill in numerical weather prediction for high southern latitudes, using global models. 
The skill displayed in pressure pattern predictions over the Australian Region by operational 
models is now as great for the fourth day beyond data cut-off time, as it was for 24 hours 
predictions in the early 1970's. Possibly, some of the improvement in 4-day prognoses for middle 
latitudes has been due to better simulation of the atmosphere at high latitudes in the models and 
the impact of improved data assimilation. A conceptual diagram of the data requirements to 
predict the weather over southeast Australia for 1,3 & 5 days ahead is given in Figure 2.

The present land-based surface observing network, including staffed stations and automatic 
stations, but excluding weather reports from ships and drifting buoys, is given in Figure 3. The 
distribution of drifting buoys at 29 February 1996 over the eastern part of the Southern 
Hemisphere is given in Figure 4. The major links of the Global Telecommunications System 
(GTS) are shown in Figure 5. The Australian Global Assimilation Prognosis (GASP) system 
developed by BMRC is currently used for operational meteorology over Antarctica and the 
Southern Ocean south of latitude 50° S. During the next five years the Australian Bureau of 
Meteorology aims to develop additional numerical weather prediction products for Antarctica.

Area for which Meteorological Services are Provided

Meteorological support for aviation (long range intra continental and intercontinental flights) and 
marine weather forecasts and sea ice information are provided from Australia's Antarctic 
Meteorological Centre at Casey. The Australian AMC responds to requests for meteorological 
services and sea ice information that are received for the area which is covered by our High 
Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) aerial at Casey. We have provided requested services 
to ships and aircraft between 50°E and 180° E, an area which is three times the size of the 
Australian continent. Routine High Seas forecasts (synoptic situation, prognoses of sea surface 
winds and total wave heights) are issued once daily between 0700 and 0900 UTC from Casey 
valid for 1200 UTC on the current day, 0000 UTC & 1200 UTC the following day. The High 
Seas charts are for two overlapping areas Western Waters (50S-70S, 60E-115E) and Eastern 
Waters (50S-70S, 105E-160E), while Meteorologists are stationed at the AMC from November 
to April.

The comprehensive range of services and high resolution data available for a large part of the 
East Antarctic has positioned the Australian AMC to assume a very important role in support of 
marine and air transport as well as scientific research.

Staffing and duties

The AMC at Casey is staffed by three meteorologists from November to April inclusive each 
"summer." There is normally 21 hours coverage daily during "summer" (2000UTC to 
1700UTC), but the coverage can be increased to 24 hours for special operational purposes. 
Meteorological and sea ice products routinely produced by the AMC at Casey include:
    MSLP ANALS at 6 hourly intervals.
    MSLP PROGS for +12 and +36 hours.
    500hPa ANALS at 12 hourly intervals (00 & 12 UTC).
    Daily graphical High Seas forecasts of sea surface wind velocity and ocean wave heights.
    Weekly sea ice images of the approaches to Casey, Davis and Mawson.

Two meteorological observers and an electronics technician winter-over at the AMC to continue 
the archiving of HRPT data on Exabyte tapes (to be replaced by DATs) for research purposes. 
During the period May to October the Tasmania Regional Forecasting Centre in Hobart provides 
any meteorological services or sea ice information requested.

Aviation Weather Services

The types of meteorological services provided to aviators commonly include: 
METAR/SPECI      These are both observations of actual conditions within the immediate 
                 vicinity of an aerodrome, designated as SPECI when conditions are 
                 unfavourable for aircraft operations but otherwise as METAR. These 
                 weather reports are made half hourly when special conditions prevail. 
                 If the criteria for issuing a SPECI (eg. cloud base and visibility are 
                 above the alternate minima) are not met then routine weather reports 
                 are issued hourly and identified as METAR by international 
                 agreement.
TTF              Trend Type Forecast. This consists of a SPECI or METAR, to which is appended a short statement describing any significant 
                 changes that are expected, during the next three hours.
TAF              Terminal Aerodrome Forecast. This is a forecast of conditions within 
                 the immediate vicinity of an aerodrome for up to 24 hours ahead.
ROFOR            Route Forecast. This is a forecast of upper winds and temperatures, 
                 any significant weather en route, etc.
ARFOR            Area Forecast. Similar to a ROFOR, but referring to a specific area 
                 rather than a particular flight.

The role and importance of meteorological support for ANARE science and operations are 
strengthening. The frequency of long range helicopter flights is increasing, as is ANARE's

18/0/4  16:19   2000 322 005   ANTARCTIC-PUBLIC   900/ZT[?]
reliance on their success and timeliness. The susceptibility of helicopters in Antarctica to 
significant en route weather during long range flights is of considerable importance. Our role in 
support of these flights is paramount.

Similarly, Qantas sight-seeing flights are increasing in their frequency and the quantity and detail 
of information they demand is not decreasing. The number of users of our AVHRR products is 
increasing with some important US contacts and collaboration being formed over the 95/96 
summer. Our other forecasting products are well used and demands for these services has never 
been stronger.

Davis Aviation Weather Service Office

Davis is the hub of the air transport operations of the Australian National Antarctic Research 
Expeditions (ANARE). In five of the last six operational seasons an aviation weather forecaster 
has been stationed for the "summer" at Davis. Since the summer of 1994/95 there have been intra 
continental helicopter flights. e.g. Davis to Casey via Mirny, a distance of nearly 1500 kilometres. 
The Aviation Weather Services Office located at Davis provides pilot briefings in person, 
ARFOR, ROFOR, TAF and TTF forecasts are issued on request under the guidance of the 
Antarctic Meteorological Centre at Casey. There is an Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) 
ground station at Davis which provides visual and infra red imagery with a resolution of 5 km. 
Upper air temperature, pressure, humidity and wind velocity profiles are measured daily at 00 and 
12 UTC at Davis and Mawson. In the summer of 1995/96 there were fifty-two separate flights 
between Davis and Mawson and eight flights between Davis and Casey. A total of 650 hours were 
flown by two helicopters for the season.

The National Meteorological and Operational Centre

The National Meteorological and Operational Centre (NMOC) in Melbourne provides guidance 
wind velocity and temperature forecasts for some flights. In these cases requests must specify 
ETD and ETA as well as the major way points along the route to be flown. These upper winds 
and upper temperature forecasts are derived from the World Area Forecast System (WAFS) 
operated in the USA. In the form provided from NMOC they may include information for up to 
four standard pressure levels.

Intercontinental Flights

Between 26 November 1995 and 7 February 1996 there were 10 Qantas sightseeing flights over 
the Antarctic continent. Six departed from Melbourne and three from Sydney to fly over Dumont 
d"Urville, the Transantarctic Mountains, Terra Nova Bay and Cape Adare. One flight departed 
from Perth to overfly the Antarctic coast near Casey. Flight planning was carried out on the basis 
of meteorological advice provided by the Antarctic Meteorological Centre at Casey. Products 
from the high resolution picture transmission aerial at Casey and the GASP model were used as 
part of the documentation supplied to Qantas. A detailed weather outlook was provided 24 hours 
before ETD and the Flight Forecast documentation being issued 4 hours before ETD. An Update 
15-09-96  19:16  2000 323 500
ANTARCTIC-PUBLIC  100/027T
   6
to the Flight Forecast was communicated to the Air Crew 4 hours after ETD. Vertical cros 
sections of the atmosphere were constructed from Australian global model (GASP) data using the 
Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) developed by Brian E. Doty at the Centre for Ocean- 
Land-Atmosphere Interactions at the University of Maryland, USA. These cross sections (see 
example given as Figure 6) have been well received by pilots, when provided at the route selection 
stage and finally as part of the official forecast documentation for a specific flight plan.

Sea Ice Information

The Australian Antarctic Meteorological Centre provides satellite images of sea ice and hard 
drawn sea ice analyses for shipping and in support of research. However the analytical tools 
needed to gather information on ice are limited and the models to predict the motion of sea ice 
are not yet widely available on an operational basis. The Antarctic CRC is one of world leaders 
in sea ice research.

Broadcast of Marine Weather Forecasts and Warnings

An impression of the relative frequency of shipping voyages between Australia and Antarctica can 
be gained from Figure 7 which shows a dot plot for each message from ships received during the 
three months January, February and March 1995.

Daily hand drawn surface streamline and isotach prognoses and total wave height predictions 
(see examples given as Figures 8 & 9) are issued daily between 0700 & 0900 UTC for the High 
Seas south of latitude 50°S and between longitudes 60°E and 160°E, divided into two sectors - 
western and eastern waters. As suggested by the Master of R/VAurora Australis, the maps for 
the two sectors over lap between 105°E and 115 E. The Australian Meteorological Centre 
transmits these products from Casey, via INMARSAT, to a Fax on board the ANARE ships 
R/VAurora Australis and M/V Polar Bird. This same service is available to ships from any other 
nation, provided any substantial costs of transmission from Casey can be recovered. Alternatively, 
arrangements can be made for the interrogation of a polling FAX system at Casey or Hobart from 
ships at sea, so then all communications costs are borne by the user. These same products are 
available on HF radio fax. HF radio facsimile broadcasts continue over radio VLM Casey (HF 
radio fax) broadcasts using HF frequencies 11,453.1 kHz and 7,468.1 kHz. The frequency is 
changed to best suit known shipping in the area.

We can meet our basic obligation under the Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS) Convention for the 
"broadcast" of forecasts and warnings of marine weather services through HF Fax. Graphical 
products in the form of gridded forecasts of winds 75 metres above the sea surface and contours 
of total wave heights (derived from the Australian global model GASP) are issued and broadcast 
at 12 hourly intervals. However, the HF Radio is to be phased out as the communications medium 
to shipping by the year 2000. We plan to institute an INTERNET based "broadcast" system by 
the beginning of the 1996/97 shipping season. A list of 10 or so standard products will be made 
available on the World Wide Web that can be down loaded by anyone with telephone access via 
INMARSAT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FROST

The First Regional (Antarctic) Observing Study of the Troposphere - the FROST project - is 
organised by the Physics and Chemistry of the Atmosphere Working Group of the Scientific 
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). The main contributors to FROST are British Antarctic 
Survey, The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Antarctic CRC at the University of Tasmania, 
the Meteorological Institute at Bonn University in Germany and the Byrd Polar Research Centre 
at the Ohio University in USA. It is anticipated that FROST will lead to improvement in the 
weather services provided for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean south of latitude 50° S. A paper 
"The Antarctic First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere (FROST) Project." by Jo in 
Turner et al is to appear in a forthcoming issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological 
Society.

The Tasmanian Earth Resources Satellite Station (TERSS)

Visible and infrared imagery taken from satellites is most useful but such observations are affected 
by clouds and not all geophysical parameters on or near the Earth's surface can be "seen", even 
under clear-sky conditions. The importance of remote sensing techniques, utilising the microwave 
part of the spectrum has been recognised.

Scatterometer Wind Vectors

Over the vast Southern Ocean, apart from drifting buoys and isolated ship observations, sea level 
air pressure measurements and sea surface wind vectors are almost totally lacking. This deficiency 
limits the performance of numerical weather prediction models and will be exacerbated as model 
resolution improves.

ERS-1 launched in 1991 was the first satellite since SEASAT in 1978 to carry a scatterometer 
for making sea surface wind observations. ERS-2 was launched in April 1995. Research scientists 
at the Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre, University of Tasmania, have obtained access to 
data from the ERS-1/ERS-2 satellites operated by the European Space Agency (ESA).

TERSS is capable of receiving low bit rate data and it is hoped that the European Space Agency 
(ESA) will downlink the low bit rate signal in the Australian region, so that direct readout can be 
achieved with follow-on active microwave satellites. Japan's Advanced Earth Observation 
Satellite (ADEOS) is scheduled to be launched in August 1996 and it will use a wind 
scatterometer instrument (NSCAT). An application has been made to the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) to obtain access to data from the ADEOS programme.

Surface winds obtained, via the scatterometer instrument on board the active microwave satellites, 
from ice-free zones of the Southern Ocean may be of use to meteorologists in three ways...
   • Assimilation of scatterometer data in global and regional numerical weather prediction 
      models.

-   Subjective assessment in regional forecasting centres leading to improvements in sea level 
    meteorological analyses and hence better marine weather forecasts.
-   Post analysis in case studies of significant wind storms.

Sea Ice Imagery

Some national meteorological services provide sea ice analyses for the use of shipping. However 
the tools needed to gather information on ice are limited and the models to predict the motion of 
sea ice are not yet widely available on an operational basis. Evaluation of the Alaskan region 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from ERS-1 for operational sea ice analysis has given 
extremely encouraging results. In this application simple algorithms work well and could generate 
sea ice concentration and ice type products with good precision in an automated mode. Improved 
sea ice analyses through studies have been made by the Antarctic CRC at the University of 
Tasmania, comparing observations made from ship and aircraft with passive microwave and active 
microwave - Synthetic Aperture Radar - (SAR) imagery available from the new generation of 
polar orbiting satellites. It is planned to investigate the feasibility of a joint venture agreement to 
install an X-band reception and archiving facility at Davis beyond the year 2000.

Limited Area Modelling

A new Limited Area Prediction Scheme (LAPS) is intended to replace the Regional Assimilation 
Scheme (RASP). The new high resolution latitude-longitude numerical weather prediction model 
extends down to latitude 65°S for the entire domain. In its trial form in BMRC, LAPS has a 
horizontal grid spacing of 0.75 degrees and 19 sigma levels in the vertical. It covers an area from 
65°S to 15°N and 65°E to 175°W. The model contains a detailed parameterisation of physical 
processes that include deep and shallow convection, large-scale rain, diagnostic clouds, stability 
dependent constant flux layer, radiative transfer, etc. The system has been running in BMRC, 
parallel with RASP, since December 1994, and verifications show significant gains over the RASP 
system.

The Bureau of Meteorology in conjunction with the Antarctic CRC has commenced to develop 
a Limited Area Model with the domain covering the whole polar area south of latitude 50S for 
synoptic scale work, which uses the fields from a global model such as GASP for the boundary 
conditions. Initially, it is intended that the domain of the Australian LAPS be extended to latitude 
75°S in a special version that can be used for some Antarctic applications.

A mesoscale version of LAPS run at a resolution of say 0.25 degrees of latitude and longitude 
over a domain of perhaps 2000 km x 2000 km is also required for scientific research such as 
modelling the heat flux associated with variable sea ice concentration. Another application is to 
the prediction of changes in wind direction and strength in the vicinity of a runway being used 
for aircraft landing and takeoff.

CONCLUSION

The standard of service available from the Australian Antarctic Meteorological Centre is
continuously improving. Advanced satellite reception facilities are being used to improve the
access of forecasters to high quality images used in the preparation of forecasts and briefing
materials, while high speed satellite links to our national meteorological centre is allowing access
to powerful computing facilities and improved numerical models of the atmosphere and
cryosphere. New products are becoming available as commercial operators enter the Antarctic
and need new services. HF radio is gradually being replaced by satellite technology, for direct
telephone voice contact, for fax polling and, more recently, for accessing forecasts via Internet
on the World Wide Web.
