Antarctic Science: Major New Initiatives

1. BAS Research Programme, 1995 - 2000

A Programme of Research proposed by the British Antarctic Survey for the period 1995 - 
2000, was approved for implementation following a process of international Peer and Merit 
Review, and has been published in the document Antarctic Science into the 21st Century. 
Copies can be posted to Delegates on request.

2. The effects of increased ultra violet on Antarctic terrestrial communities

Scientists from Britain, Italy and the USA gathered on a remote peninsula called Edmondson 
Point in the Ross Sea to carry out the first international BIOTAS (Biological Investigations of 
Terrestrial Antarctic Systems) programme - BIOTEX 1. In a series of co-ordinated studies in 
December and January they examined the effects of UV-B (combined with desiccation and 
freezing) as well as other effects of global change on bacteria, fungi, algae, nematodes, 
springtails, mosses and lichens. Very small increases in the UV-B were found to produce 
major changes in pigmentation but these were reversible. Physiological measurements were 
made to determine the reduction in photosynthesis caused by the extra pigment production 
whilst image analyses of microbial communities were used to investigate the changes in 
community structure.

3. Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO)

BAS now has four AGOs deployed and running on the polar plateau south of its Halley 
Research Station. The AGOs support equipment for collecting and storing data for studies on 
many solar-terrestrial physics and meterological phenomena. In addition two of the AGOs 
host two experiments using search coil magnetometers and broad band noise receivers for 
Augsberg College and Dartmouth College respectively, participants in the United States 
Antarctic Programme.

4. Ecology of the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone

The 1995/96 season saw the start of a new SCAR biology programme EASIZ (Ecology of the 
Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone). This is a ten-year programme of research in the coastal and shelf 
marine environment of Antarctica. Ship-based research will make a significant contribution 
to EASIZ, but its major feature is that it provides a coherent scientific framework to link the 
research undertaken at the network of shore-based research stations around Antarctica. The 
Science Plan and Implementation Plan for EASIZ have now been published by SCAR, and 
the programme is guided by a small Steering Committee. In this first season work has started 
at several shore-based stations on the Core programme of nearshore oceanographic and 
biological measurements, and the Alfred-Wegener-Institut have mounted an EASIZ cruise to 
the eastern Weddell Sea.
