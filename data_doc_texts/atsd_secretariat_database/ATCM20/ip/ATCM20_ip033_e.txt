EDUCATIONAL AND AESTHETIC VALUES
OF THE
ANTARCTIC

This paper outlines Australia's activities relating to the promotion of the
educational and aesthetic values of the Antarctic. The Australian Antarctic
Program is active in the promotion of the unique values of
the Antarctic region. Australia is aware that protection of the wilderness
and aesthetic values of Antarctica is an important element
of the Madrid Protocol and in recent years has steadily raised the profile of
Antarctica and its values through a diverse range of initiatives. These
include:

i)      conduct of a dedicated public relations program by the Australian
        Antarctic Division;

ii)     independent promotion of Antarctica through the Australian
        Antarctic Foundation which funds educational projects;

iii)    use of new technology including establishment of Antarctic sites
        on the World Wide Web;

iv)     assistance with participation in Australian National Antarctic
        Research Expeditions (ANARE) for artists and other non scientific
        personnel;

v)      involvement in Antarctic studies at educational institutions;

vi)     support for the proposed Antarctic and Southern Ocean educational
        and display centre in Hobart; and

vii)    conferences and seminars.

i)      Antarctic Program Public Relations

The Australian Antarctic Program is administered by the Australian
Antarctic Division, a part of the Federal Environment Department. For
many years the Australian Antarctic Division has dedicated resources to
educational and public relations activities. Through a variety of
means such as press releases, video productions, support for artistic
exhibitions, production of information booklets, posters and leaflets
and contributions to science festivals, open days and other educational
forums, the Australian Antarctic Division has sought to increase the
awareness of the intrinsic values of Antarctic wilderness, the
importance of the science conducted there and the need to protect the
environment. Material is generally provided free of charge to members
of the public, schools, researchers, commercial and private tourist expedi-
tions both within Australia and overseas to enable all levels as wide a
spectrum of the community as possible to appreciate the unique qualities of 
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Australia welcomes Treaty parties 
contacting the Australian Antarctic Division for samples of this material.

Recent productions of interest to Treaty parties (some of which are 
available on request from the Australian Antarctic Division) include:

-    videos on global change research in the Antarctic and on activities at 
     Antarctic research stations;

-    a comprehensive colour booklet on all aspects of Australia's Antarctic 
     research, plus a brochure series on individual themes such as 
     the importance of Antarctic research, living in Antarctica and polar 
     medical research;

-    a periodical magazine series, ANARE News, with features on current 
     research and other activities in Antarctica;

-    a series of mobile exhibition display panels on selected Antarctic 
     research and operational activities for use at exhibitions, conferences 
     and seminars;

-    special Antarctic photographic displays at the Australian Parliament 
     House and at museums and art galleries highlighting the natural and 
     scientific qualities of the Antarctic; and

-    regular press releases on activities such as the World Ocean Circula-
     tion Experiment (WOCE) and the Convention on the Conservation of 
     Antarctic Living Marine Resources (CCAMLR).

Apart from its own productions the Australian Antarctic Division is a 
focal point for providing expertise and advice for independent 
publications about Antarctica which has expanded the selection of 
books, videos, educational kits and artistic material available to the public.

In 1997 Australia will be celebrating 50 years of ANARE achievements in 
Antarctica through a Jubilee program which, through a series of 
television broadcasts, a science symposium, books and videos, public displays 
and exhibitions, will further promote the unique values of the Antarctic region.

ii)  Australian Antarctic Foundation

The Australian Antarctic Foundation was established by the Australian 
Government in 1991 to promote informed debate on international 
Antarctic issues. It essentially provides through a grant scheme an
avenue of support for government and non-government organisations and 
individuals, both in Australia and internationally, to contribute to 
the body of published material on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. 
As such it supplements the public relations work of the Australian 
Antarctic Division by providing an additional source of Antarctic educational 
material from a variety of independent sources. The 
Foundation has an initial underlying purpose of promoting the values of 
the Antarctic environment and assisting with the promotion of the environ-
mental obligations under the Madrid Protocol. Since 1994 its 
focus has expanded to include issues such as international politics and 
management of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, Antarctic tourism and 
the importance of Antarctica to the world.

Since 1991 the Foundation has supported over 80 projects in range of 
media such as books, videos, CD-ROMs, conferences and workshops, 
museums and photographic exhibitions, educational kits, posters, post graduate 
scholarships and support for overseas participation in 
Antarctic research. The products from these projects have been used by 
diplomatic posts, educational institutions, community organisations, scientific 
researchers, government policy makers and individual members 
of the public, both in Australia and overseas.

Some of the more significant projects supported by the Foundation 
include:

    the development of a comprehensive conservation strategy that 
provides a framework for implementing obligations arising 
from the Madrid Protocol;

    major museum exhibitions on Antarctica, whales and the historical 
artefact collection of pioneer Australian Antarctic explorer Sir 
Douglas Mawson;

    international workshops on environmental management practices, the 
future of the Antarctic Treaty system and women in Antarctica;

    support for CCAMLR to publicize methods of reducing seabird 
mortality through longline fishing; and

    a new secondary school text on Antarctica and a substantial educational 
kit for primary and lower secondary school students on the environ-
ment of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.

The Foundation is a joint Federal/State Government venture currently adminis-
tered by the Tasmanian Office of Antarctic Affairs and welcomes approaches 
from Treaty parties on appropriate projects for future 
funding.
iii)     Use of New Technology to Promote Antarctica

The use of satellite and digital technology is proving to be an increasingly important means of providing worldwide awareness of the natural values of Antarctica and the various activities undertaken there. Australia has taken major steps in recent years to broaden this access using modern satellite and digital technology. Digital cameras are used at all of Australia's research stations in Antarctica and at Macquarie Island to provide immediate satellite transfer of photographic images and other data potentially to any location in the world.

In August 1995 the Australian Antarctic Division opened a World Wide Web site for world wide public access to a full range of Australia's Antarctic Program activities. The site now contains a growing record of not only general information on Antarctica but detailed information on Australia's Antarctic research, operational activities, research application process, history of Antarctic exploration, press releases, public events, and features that provide the public with real time Antarctic experience such as progress reports of Antarctic voyages and current Antarctic weather. The Australian Antarctic Division Web site also includes a live television image from Antarctica. The site also provides valuable linkages to other national Antarctic Programs and related environmental protection and scientific research sites so that viewers can immediately gain a comprehensive awareness of Antarctic values and issues. There are a number of other Antarctic-related Web sites in Australia.

The Australian Antarctic Division has accumulated an invaluable historical archive of over 350,000 photographic images dating back to the start of the century. This collection is now being transferred onto digital photo CD format to greatly enhance access for future Antarctic promotional material and provide an improved medium for extended use and preservation. There is also in excess of 500,000 feet of historical film footage that is currently being transferred to video tape format to enhance its access and preservation.

iv)   Participation in ANARE

The Australian Antarctic Program conducts its activities in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions through the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) which are organised by the Australian Antarctic Division. Each season the Australian Antarctic Division sets aside a small number of ship berths to allow selected artists, journalists, authors, poets, visual artists, photographers and multimedia specialists to visit Antarctica. Through this program a different perspective is gained on the Antarctic experience and the resultant documentaries, books, multimedia products, newspaper and magazine articles and art or photo-
graphic exhibitions broaden the aesthetic appeal of Antarctica to different 
levels of the community in Australia and overseas.

v)     Educational Institutions

Antarctic studies has been gaining popularity in Australia in recent years 
in primary, secondary and tertiary educational programs. The Institute of 
Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies (IASOS), established at the 
University of Tasmania in 1988, provides Australia with a dedicated 
postgraduate study centre on a wide range of Antarctic science, legal and 
environmental management issues. Currently there are over 60 post 
graduate students associated with this institute making it one of the most 
extensive Antarctic research training programs in the world. Many of 
these postgraduate students are engaged in practical research under the 
direction of the Co-operative Research Centre for the Antarctic and 
Southern Ocean Environment (Antarctic CRC), an Australian Govern-
ment initiative co-located with IASOS that combines the contributions of 
the University with the various partners of Australia's Antarctic Program 
in a range of research programs primarily focused on the processes of 
global climate and environmental change.

Specialist tertiary courses on Antarctic issues for post graduates or 
professionals in related fields have also been conducted, often with the 
support of the Australian Antarctic Foundation, in areas such as legal 
aspects of Antarctic environment protection and practical application of 
the various measures of the Madrid Protocol.

Secondary and primary schools now include Antarctic issues in various 
studies curriculums such as environmental science, social sciences, 
economics, technology and geography. The Australian Antarctic 
Division has recognised an increasing interest and need for awareness of 
Antarctic issues in schools and has contracted a teacher to develop a 
strategy for the Australian Antarctic Division to produce or assist in the 
production of educational resources.

vi)    Establishment of an educational exhibition centre

The Tasmanian Government with support from the Federal Government 
will establish a major exhibition centre based on Antarctic and Southern 
Ocean themes. The Centre will showcase Australian and Antarctic 
research. Information from the Centre is being provided by the Austra-
lian Antarctic Division, the University of Tasmania, the Australian 
Bureau of Meteorology, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Tasmanian Department of Environ-
ment and Land Management and the Tasmanian Museum and Art 
Gallery. The display will be layered and interactive to give patrons of
the Centre an appreciation of the Antarctic region's vital role in the global system. The Centre is due to open in December 1997.

vii)     International conferences and seminars

Australia has hosted numerous international conferences, seminars and other public forums in recent years as a means of raising the public profile of significant issues for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean region. Recent international conferences hosted in Australia include the First International Conference on the Biology and Conservation of Albatrosses, the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science on Climate succession and Glacial History of the Southern Hemisphere over the past 5 million years, an International Conference on Southern Hemisphere Meteorology and Oceanography and the annual meetings of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Additionally, the Australian Antarctic Foundation sponsored the International Symposium on the Future of the Antarctic Treaty System held in Argentina in 1995. These conferences have attracted widespread media coverage and resulted in publications that have raised community awareness of the values of global climate change research, protection and management of the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic ecosystems and threats to marine and land species in the region.

Australia's ANARE Jubilee celebrations in 1997 will feature high profile international symposia on both the 50 years of ANARE science achievements and on the Antarctic and Global Change. Australia encourages the participation of representatives of Treaty parties to both symposiums.
