IUCN INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN ANTARCTICA: MINIMISATION AND MANAGEMENT
(Agenda Item 18)
(Submitted by IUCN)
IUCN International Workshop on Cumulative Environmental Impacts 
in Antarctica: Minimisation and Management

Information Paper submitted to the XX ATCM

Agenda Item 18: Application and Implementation of EIA procedures

Submitted by IUCN, The World Conservation Union's 
Antarctic Advisory Committee, April 1996.

The Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection (the Protocol) makes 
several references to cumulative environmental impact. Implementation of the Protocol 
will require a better understanding of this concept and its ramifications for environmental 
management.

IUCN has co-hosted (with SCAR) several workshops on environmental issues of relevance 
to the ATS in the last few years. In continuation of this tradition, IUCN is organising a 
workshop on Antarctic cumulative environmental impacts in September 1996, in 
Washington D.C (USA), with the aim of addressing these issues.

Participation from twenty invited experts from the polar and environmental assessment 
impact communities will ensure a wide range of expertise.

Workshop components

1.  Identification of causal factors resulting in cumulative impacts (e.g accumulation 
    over time, through activities in the same area by different operators, additional 
    impacts due to biological synergisms, etc.).

2.  •  Identification of information required to allow proper consideration of 
       cumulative impacts during management of activities. What is the nature of this 
       information (e.g both operational and scientific) and how might it best be made 
       available to others?
    •  Based on existing procedures for information gathering and exchange 
       (formal as well as informal), identification of gaps that might need to be filled, and 
       suggestions as to how this could be achieved.

3.  Drawing upon the SCAR/COMNAP workshops on monitoring (October 1995 and 
    March 1996), identification of other scientific, technical and management 
    requirements for monitoring for cumulative impacts (e.g. different time frames, 
    cooperation between several operators).

4.  Discussion of how cumulative impacts can best be integrated in EIA procedures.
5.      Synthesis of existing knowledge on how cumulative impacts have manifested 
        themselves on different components of Antarctic ecosystems. Can obvious gaps be 
        identified?  What can we learn and apply from non-Antarctic experience?  Can 
        areas of research be identified that should be encouraged or supported?

Outputs

The workshop will be structured with the intention that the results from the workshop will 
be useful in a very practical way to national and non-governmental operators, the Antarctic 
scientific community and the ATS in general.

The draft report will be presented at the IUCN's World Conservation Congress (14-23 
October 1996, Montreal, Canada). The final report will be distributed, for information, at 
the 1997 ATCM, 1997 GOSEAC, 1988 SCAR. The final report will also be published in 
the IUCN "Conservation of Southern Polar Regions" series.
