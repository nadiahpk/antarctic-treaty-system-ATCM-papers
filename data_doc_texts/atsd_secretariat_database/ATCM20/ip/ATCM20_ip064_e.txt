ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF THE ISLANDS OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN: TOWARDS A FULL COVERAGE OF MANAGEMENT PLANS

Antarctic Advisory Committee, April 1996

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LINKS BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ISLANDS AND THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT

● There are a number of reasons why environmental protection of the southern cold-temperate and sub-Antarctic islands is of interest to members of the Antarctic Treaty, even though the islands fall outside the Antarctic Treaty area.

Firstly, the islands form a ring around the Antarctic Continent ("Insulantarctica") and support biota (especially birds and seals) which can be found breeding and foraging farther south, within the area defined by the Antarctic Treaty. Secondly, the seas surrounding the southern islands are of importance in the Antarctic Treaty System because fishing activities within them are regulated through the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Thirdly, the need for monitoring of "dependent and associated ecosystems" outside the Antarctic Treaty area (such as the southern islands) is included (Article 3e) in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Fourthly, the islands are the destination of a steadily increasing number of visits by tourist vessels which may also visit Antarctica, often on the same voyages, again suggesting the value of an exchange of information required for environmental protection. Lastly, the meteorological and/or research stations on the islands of the Southern Ocean are administered by national governmental Antarctic programmes, providing close links at the scientific, logistic and conservation management levels between the islands and the Antarctic Continent.

● The continued wise conservation management of the Southern Ocean islands is of interest to all Antarctic Treaty nations, especially those that possess such islands. One way to facilitate a mutually beneficial exchange of information is through engendering close links between members with both Antarctic and Southern Ocean island expertise of such conservation bodies as The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Antarctic Advisory Committee, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation, and the Committee for Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (when formally constituted and the Treaty's Transitional Environmental Working Group (in the interim). Exchanges of tabled papers and proceedings and the setting up of a reciprocal observer system are two ways that may be considered in this regard. It is to be noted that SCAR's area of interest specifically includes some of the cool-temperate and the sub-Antarctic islands lying to the north of the Antarctic Polar Front (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research 1987, p. 4).

● Protection of the essentially pristine environments of the islands requires the adoption and consistent execution of a set of conservation management policies. To this end, management plans can greatly assist in the identification of important conservation issues and programmes. At its last General Assembly, IUCN made the formal recommendation that it offers assistance with management plans for individual islands or groups (Recommendation 19.95. Improved
Protection for Wildlife in Subantarctic Island Ecosystems) (World Conservation Union 1994).
In this information paper, existing management plans (and some allied documents) are listed 
by island, thus identifying those islands for which management plans are currently lacking,
in support of IUCN's Recommendation.

SOUTHERN OCEAN ISLAND CONSERVATION REVIEWS

Two major reviews of the conservation status of the Southern Ocean islands have been 
published, one under the auspices of SCAR by Bonner & Lewis Smith (1985) and one under 
the auspices of IUCN by Clark & Dingwall (1985). A revision of these two documents is 
currently being undertaken for joint publication as one document by SCAR and IUCN (P.R. 
Dingwall, New Zealand Department of Conservation in litt.).

Further, SCAR and IUCN have jointly held two international workshops on the conservation 
of the Southern Ocean islands (Walton 1986, Dingwall 1995). Lastly, in yet another 
SCAR/IUCN collaboration, Dingwall (1996) has briefly reviewed and listed the management 
plans for Southern Ocean islands, utilizing information available up to 1993. This information 
paper provides more up-to-date information to that given by Dingwall (1996).

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FUTURE

The following actions, identified by islands or island groups and nations, are required so that
3
all the Southern Ocean islands have management plans in place:

1.    Adoption of draft and revision of existing management plans:

      Macquarie Island (Australia) and the New Zealand southern islands

2.    Publication of formally adopted management plan:

      Prince Edward Islands (South Africa)

3.    Production of management plans:

      The islands of St Paul, Crozet and Kerguelen (France), Bouvet (Norway) and South Georgia and South Sandwich (Argentina/United Kingdom), Inaccessible, Nightingale and Tristan da Cunha (United Kingdom).

CONCLUSIONS

The World Conservation Union's Antarctic Advisory Committee wishes to applaud the Antarctic Treaty Parties for developing a comprehensive and consistent approach to management planning on the Antarctic Continent. It is also noted that the expertise developed by this approach has been extended by the relevant governmental agencies to outside the Antarctic Treaty area, for example by the production and implementation of management plans for many of the southern islands.

Close relationships and a continued exchange of knowledge between conservation management authorities on the Antarctic Continent and on the islands of "Insulantarctica" will enhance the level of environmental protection within the whole southern region.

To ensure consistent management throughout the Antarctic and sub- Antarctic regions, all the islands of the Southern Ocean outside the Antarctic Treaty area should have formally adopted management plans whose strictures and guidelines are followed by the relevant authorities. The plans should be published and readily available to the public. To this end, the relevant governmental authorities are encouraged to produce management plans, using existing island plans as guidelines, for those southern islands under their authority which do not currently have formally adopted and published plans.

By so doing a ring of fully protected and wisely managed islands will encircle Antarctica, leading to the enhanced conservation status of the whole southern region.
