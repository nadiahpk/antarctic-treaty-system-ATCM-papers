OPENING ADDRESS BY DR. A. E. MUTHUNAYAGAM, SECRETARY,
DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA & HEAD
OF THE DELEGATION OF INDIA

(Agenda Item 3)

(Submitted by India)
Address by Dr. A.E. Muthunayagam, Secretary,
Department of Ocean Development, Government
of India & Head of the Delegation of India

Mr. Chairman,

At the outset, I like to express our deep
appreciation to the Government of The Netherlands for
hosting the XXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and
for the excellent hospitality extended to us in this
beautiful city of Utrecht.  India's commitment to the
Antarctic Treaty as a Consultative party is effectively
reflected in its active participation in successive
Antarctic expeditions and associated organizations of the
Antarctic treary systems like SCAR and CCAMLR.

2.      India has successfully completed 15
expeditions to Antarctica and one special expedition to the
Weddell Sea area. Based on the experience gained in these
expeditions we are now set to launch a ten year scientific
programme from the beginning of 1997 which will include
pioneering programmes in Atmospheric Sciences, Earth
Sciences, Biological Sciences, Human Psychology and
Environment.  We are also going to start a new Antarctic
Study Centre at Goa from next year which will have state of
the art facilities for scientific research in specific areas
of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.

3.      The year 1995 is significant to us as India
for the first time has taken out an expedition to Area 58 in
Antarctic Waters for a resource assessment and survey for
krill and other Antarctic fish.  The expedition was
organised with the Indian oceanographic research vessel
'SAGAR SAMPADA' with fifteen scientists on board.  As a part
of an Indo-Polish Scientific and technological Cooperation
Programme, we also got the help of three Polish experts who
participated in this expedition. We take this opportuity to
express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the
Government of Poland and to the Sea Fisheries Institute,
Gdynia, for their active help and cooperation.  The resource
assessment survey has yielded promising results and we like
to continue the work more actively in future.  The CCAMLR
has duly been informed about this new endeavour from the
Indian side.

4.      India's commitment to the protection of
Antarctic environment has been adequately reflected in our
efforts to establish a Protocol on Protection of Antarctic
Environment.  India is one of the original sponsors of the Environmental protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and is one of the earlier signatories.  We are very glad to inform the members that India has now decided to ratify the Protocol. The Instrument of Ratification has already been sent to our Ambassador in the United States to formally deposit it with the Government of United States who are the depository for the protocol.  We hope that the process of ratification of the protocol by all the countries will be completed shortly and the Committee for Environment Protection will be constituted very soon.  We are glad to note that the Transitional Environmental Working Group which met for the first time in the last ATCM has done impressive work.  We like to see that the good efforts of this Group would continue in this meeting also.

5.      India has actively participated in the deliberations of the Group on Liability Annex to the Antarctic protocol and we are glad to see that the fifth offering has been circulated for discussion during the current session of the ATCM. We hope that the deliberations will be fruitful and a commonly accepted Liability Annex would evolve which takes into consideration the practical realities and the financial capabilities of developing countries participating in Antarctic expeditions.

6.      In all these and other matters figuring in the agenda, I assure our complete coperation from the Indian delegation to arrive at quick and acceptable decisions through consensus.  We look forward to a very fruitful outcome of this meeting under your Chairmanship.

Thank you.
