PRELIMINARY OVERVIEW OF ANTARCTIC TOURISM 1995-1997

(Agenda item 9)

(Submitted by IAATO)
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide a 
summary of actual numbers of shipborne travelers during the 1995-96 season and a 
preliminary overview of the estimated number of passengers for the 1996-97 season.

1.      Seaborne Tourism

(a)     Approximately 9,212 people traveled to the Antarctic on commercially-
organized tour vessels in the November 1995 to March 1996 season -- an 
increase of 1,000 over the total for the 1994-95 season. A summary is 
appended to this report. A number of private yachts also sailed to Antarctica, 
some with paying passengers. See XX ATCM INF15 for information on tourist 
visits, including yachts. Also, the Office of Polar Programs at the U.S. 
National Science Foundation distributes a summary of Antarctic tourism each 
July at the annual tour operators meeting.

(b)     According to information provided by tour operators to the IAATO Secretariat, 
100 voyages are planned for the 1996-97 season, which will carry an estimated 
6,500 travelers aboard 13 tour vessels. This represents a significant decrease in 
the number of travelers over past years, attributable to fewer voyages and to 
the fact that no voyages are planned by the larger cruise vessels.

(c)     All of the 15 commercially-organized Antarctic tour vessels that sailed in 1995-
96 were operated by IAATO members. Nine of the vessels were of Russian (or 
Estonian) registry, which continues a trend over the last several years. These 
cruise vessels, research vessels and icebreakers carry 36 to 114 passengers and 
were purpose-built for polar travel.

(d)     Following the trend, most of these voyages are concentrated along the 
Antarctic Peninsula during the four-month Austral summer, departing from 
Ushuaia or, in fewer numbers, from Punta Arenas or Stanley. The Tourism 
Board of Tierra del Fuego has compiled useful statistics over the last several 
years. Only eight of the 100 departures announced for 1996-97 will use 
Australia or New Zealand as a port of departure.

(e)     The average number of passengers per voyage in 1995-96 was 81.5 (ranging 
from 13 to 452) with an average carrying capacity of 105. The average 
carrying capacity of the fleet for 1996-97 is 79 passengers (36 to 180).
(f) Commercial Antarctic Tour Vessels

* The Marco Polo has a capacity of 800 passengers but is limited to 400 for
Antarctic operations as per IAATO bylaws and agreement with Orient Lines.

2.       Land-based Tourism

IAATO-member Adventure Network International, which operates a seasonal facility
at Patriot Hills, Ellsworth Mountains, brought 155 travelers and 20 staff to the
Antarctic in 1995-96, its 10th Antarctic season. Its expeditioners included a group of
children from Chile and England as invited guests. In addition to its regular climbing
programs to Vinson Massif (53), flights to the South Pole (58), ski journeys (38) and
Emperor penguin camp (6), ANI continued logistical and emergency support for all
private-expeditions. ANI supported seven private expeditions this season, including
two emergency pick-ups in the interior. ANI instituted a satellite weather station at
Patriot Hills for the first time this season, providing weather reports for its activities
and also for the Antarctic Treaty Parties.
3. Overflights

(a) After a successful inaugural season in 1995-96, Croydon Travel of Victoria,
Australia again operated Qantas Antarctic Day Sightseeing flights from
Melbourne aboard Qantas Airlines Boeing 747 aircraft. Six flights were offered
in 1994-95 and nine flights were offered from 26 November, 1995 to 27
January 1996. A total of 2,958 passengers participated in 1995-96 with
approximately 23 crew per flight for a total of 3,160 carried for the season.
Aerolineas Argentinas has operated commercially scheduled "transpolar" flights
between Argentina and New Zealand for years.

(b) Qantas Airlines submitted a Preliminary Assessment of Environmental Impacts
of the Proposal to Conduct Tourist Overflights of the Antarctic Continent in
November 1994. The flights and their potential impacts were reviewed in XIX
ATCM INF 34 and XIX ATCM INF 38. Questions of insurance, self-
sufficiency and search-and-rescue were thoroughly reviewed in this assessment.
XX ATCM INF34 pertains to the 1995-96 overflights.

(c) Several authors have included these overflights in the total number of travelers
to the Antarctic. These flights, however, are inherently different -- with no
landings and minimal direct impact. While IAATO is continuing discussions
with Croydon Travel (which requested membership information), this is a very
different operation from that of other IAATO members.
