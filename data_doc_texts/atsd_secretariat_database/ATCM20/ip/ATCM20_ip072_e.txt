SCAR REPORT TO XX ATCM
UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS
29 APRIL - 10 MAY 1996

OPENING ADDRESS BY PROFESSOR A C ROCHA-CAMPOS,
PRESIDENT OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTIC RESEARCH

SCAR is pleased to participate in this meeting and looks forward to making a contribution towards its success. The SCAR activities since XIX ATCM have included the meeting of the SCAR Executive Committee in Siena, Italy 16-20 September 1995, meetings of some Groups of Specialists, a symposium and some workshops. The most important of these activities, including those relevant to the work of the Antarctic Treaty System, are reported here.

The Full Membership of SCAR has not changed but Colombia withdrew from Associate Membership of SCAR in April 1995. The closer relations with the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) are strengthening cooperation, leading to more effective execution of scientific research in the Antarctic.

SCAR continues to be active in initiating, promoting and coordinating a diversity of scientific activities, but only a few can be briefly noted here

The SCAR Global Change Programme has re-focused its scientific priorities to concentrate on palaeoenvironmental records and ice sheet mass balance. The SCAR Global Change Programme Office has been established in the Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, University of Tasmania, Hobart, and a full-time Programme Coordinator is in post. In addition, the Programme Office is providing for other SCAR programmes that have a global change component. The Programme Office will also act as the formal institutional linkage between SCAR and International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) / World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) through the START framework, by taking on the role of the System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) Regional Committee for the Antarctic.

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation (GOSEAC) met in Christchurch, New Zealand, during June 1995 and will meet in Puerto Iguazu, Argentina, during June 1996. The work of GOSEAC is increasingly relevant to the Protocol

                                                                               1
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  In 
conjunction with COMNAP, two workshops on environmental 
monitoring have been held in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995 
and in College Station, Texas, USA, during March 1996. SCAR 
strongly believes that the object of such monitoring should be to 
provide efficiently, effectively and at minimum cost, a continuing 
index of the health of the Antarctic terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems at both local and regional levels.

On the subject of Antarctic data management, the SCAR and 
COMNAP Executive Committees accepted the proposal from the 
International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research 
(ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand, to host and develop the 
Antarctic Master Directory (AMD). The project is being funded by a 
consortium of four countries and software development for the 
system is progressing well.

Other groups have been active. The SCAR Group of Specialists on 
Seals has developed a five-year programme on Antarctic Pack Ice 
Seal (APIS) and so far more than 40 research projects involving 
scientists from 18 nations have been identified under APIS.  A 
circumpolar survey of Antarctic pack ice seals is planned for the 
1998-99 Antarctic summer season.  The Coastal and Shelf Ecology of 
the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (CS-EASIZ) programme, developed by 
the SCAR Group of Specialists on Southern Ocean Ecology 
(GOSSOE), is now in operation and the first season of field work has 
been undertaken. This programme is being closely supported by the 
SCAR Global Change Programme Office.

These are some of the highlights of SCAR's diverse activities. In 
these and other ways SCAR wishes to maintain its input of advice 
to the Antarctic Treaty System. However, I wish to emphasize again 
that SCAR's activities, in both basic and applied science, are 
inevitably constrained by financial limitations.  In particular, 
SCAR's applied role of providing scientific advice to the Antarctic 
Treaty would be even more effective if funding from the Antarctic 
Treaty System could be made available to support the meetings 
necessary to generate that advice.

                                                               29 APRIL - 10 MAY 1996

1. INTRODUCTION

Since XIX ATCM in Seoul, May 1995, the SCAR Executive Committee has met
and some SCAR groups have held meetings. In addition, the President of SCAR
attended the annual meeting of COMNAP and the Chairman of COMNAP
attended the SCAR Executive Meeting, underlining the continuing cooperation
between the two organizations for the benefit of Antarctic science.

The membership of SCAR now comprises 25 Full Members and 7 Associate
Members (see Appendix 1). Unfortunately, Colombia withdrew from Associate
Membership of SCAR during the year. The membership of the Executive
Committee (Appendix 2) and the Chief Officers of SCAR subsidiary groups
(Appendix 3) are unchanged since XIX ATCM.

2. SCAR-COMNAP COOPERATION

SCAR and COMNAP continue to maintain routine contact through their
Secretariats. In addition, the President of SCAR attended the annual meeting of
COMNAP in Santiago, Chile, during August 1995 and the Chairman of
COMNAP attended the meeting of the SCAR Executive Committee in Siena,
Italy, during September 1995. A joint meeting of the SCAR and COMNAP
Executive Committees will be held during the XXIX SCAR meeting in
Cambridge, United Kingdom, during August 1996.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND CONSERVATION

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation held its
seventh meeting (GOSEAC VII) in Christchurch, New Zealand, during June 1995
and will meet again in Puerto Iguazú, Argentina, during June 1996. The meeting
discussed many topics including the planning of two joint SCAR-COMNAP
Workshops on environmental monitoring and a "Management Plan
Handbook" for protected areas. The two workshops have since taken place, the
first in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995, and the second at College Station,
Texas, USA, during March 1966. A brief account of these workshops is given in a
joint  SCAR-COMNAP Information Paper and a full report and
recommendations will be available at XXI ATCM in Christchurch, New Zealand,
during 1997. Progress with the Handbook has been delayed and is not available
at this meeting as was originally intended. A complete draft will be considered at
GOSEAC VIII (June 1996) and this will be passed to SCAR for comment. It is 
intended that a final version should be tabled at XXI ATCM.

The meeting also considered checklists for environmental impact assessment in 
relation to four different scientific activities in the Antarctic: activities in near-
shore or shallow coastal areas; drilling in rock/soil/sediments; ice drilling; and 
seismic traverses [on land]. These checklists will be discussed by the relevant 
SCAR Working Groups during XXIV SCAR in Cambridge, United Kingdom, 
during August 1996.

4. Antarctic Data

The joint SCAR-COMNAP request for proposals to host the Antarctic Master 
Directory (AMD) and develop the Antarctic Data Directory System (ADDS) led to 
the proposal from the International Centre for Antarctic Information and 
Research (ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand being accepted by the SCAR and 
COMNAP Executive Committees. The project is being funded by a consortium 
of four countries working in the Ross Sea Sector: New Zealand, United States, 
Italy and France. A Steering Committee has been established with 
representatives from the four funding partners, SCAR and COMNAP and held 
its first meeting in December 1995. ICAIR staff are currently developing the 
software necessary for operating the Directory System. Several SCAR countries 
have now identified their National Antarctic Data Centre (NADC) and will be 
providing data when requested.

5. The Antarctic and Global Change

The SCAR Global Change Programme Office has been established in the 
Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean 
Environment at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. This office is 
hosted by the Research Centre and a full-time Programme Coordinator has been 
appointed. The Programme Coordinator will be responsible for coordinating 
those aspects of all SCAR programmes that are collecting data relevant to global 
change studies and ensuring that other related international programmes are 
aware of these data.

The Group of Specialists has focused its programme on two major fields: "Global 
Palaeoenvironmental Records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and Marine and Land 
Sediments" and "Ice Sheet Mass Balance and Sea-Level". In the field of 
palaeoenvironmental records a strong link has been established with the Past 
Global Changes (PAGES) programme of IGBP that is examining global changes 
over the past 250.000 years. PAGES has joined with the SCAR group to 
formulate a coherent bi-polar attack in the future strategy for ice-coring.

Several national programmes are already collecting data that contribute to 
knowledge of the ice sheet mass balance. Remote-sensing is the principal 
method, using data from satellites and radio-echo sounding flights, but ground-

truth data are also being collected. A major aim is to determine the ice-mass flux 
outward from the ice sheet across the grounding line into the ocean by the 
measurement of ice thickness around the entire Antarctic perimeter.

Other SCAR programmes, notably the Coastal and Shelf - Ecology of the 
Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (CS-EASIZ) and the Biological Investigations of Terrestrial 
Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) have major components that are relevant to global 
change research. In addition the Group of Specialists is developing two new 
programmes that will be proposed to SCAR: Antarctic Sea-Ice Processes, 
Ecosystems and Climate (ASPECT) and Antarctic Ice Margin Evolution 
(ANTIME). ASPECT will examine how the ecosystems and climate are 
influenced by sea-ice processes whereas ANTIME will investigate fluctuation of 
the ice margin during the past 250,000 years as recorded in marine and terrestrial 
sediments.

In February 1996, the SCAR Global Change Programme Coordinator met with 
the IGBP Core Programme Directors to reach an understanding for the 
integration of Antarctic global change data into existing IGBP programmes as 
appropriate. This will lead to the SCAR Global Change Programme Office being 
recognized as the focal point for the Antarctic information and data exchange 
relevant to global change.

6. ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL SCIENCES

Monitoring of Antarctic ozone levels continues both from ground-based stations 
and from satellites. Recent results show that the springtime ozone depletion 
over the Antarctic is not deepening significantly from year to year although the 
area affected is greater in some years. The situation is forecast to continue for 
many years yet before a significant improvement is noted but scientists are 
reluctant to suggest that the trough of depletion has been reached. The scientific 
community continues to express its concerns about ozone depletion and notes 
that other compounds (such as methyl bromide) in addition to CFCs are now 
known to destroy ozone.

Workshops were held by the First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere 
(FROST) and the Antarctic Geospace Observatory Network (AGONET) 
programmes of the Working Groups on Physics and Chemistry of the 
Atmosphere and on Solar-Terrestrial and Astrophysical Research respectively. 
The FROST programme is yielding coordinated synoptic observations of the 
Antarctic troposphere for the first time and these are being used to compare 
weather prediction schemes over the Antarctic continent. Extra data fed into 
models for specific
Weather Initiative. Such studies can help to improve the cost-effectiveness of 
space satellite technology.

7. Biological Sciences

Through its Antarctic Pack-Ice Seals (APIS) Programme, SCAR has developed a 
five-year programme of research on Antarctic pack-ice seals. This initiative, that 
originated with the SCAR Group of Specialists on Seals, aims to promote studies 
of the status of Antarctic pack-ice seal populations and the role they have in the 
Antarctic ecosystem. The data collected will provide vital information for the 
administration of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals 
(CCAS). To date, 41 research projects involving scientists from 18 nations have 
been identified under APIS. The programme plan includes a major proposal 
intends to carry out a circumpolar survey of Antarctic pack ice seals in the 
1998-99 field season and significant levels of ship support are being sought for 
this. The last planning meeting was held in Seattle during June 1995 and the 
next meeting will be in Cambridge during July 1996.

The APIS Programme can be expected to produce information of value to several 
Antarctic research programmes and inter-governmental organizations. These 
include CEP, CCAS, CCAMLR, (including CEMP), Southern Ocean - Global 
Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Research (SO-GLOBEC), Scientific Committee on 
Oceanic Research (SCOR), Southern Ocean - Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (SO-
JGOFS), SCAR-GLOCHANT, and International Whaling Commission (IWC).

The Coastal and Shelf - Ecology of the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (CS-EASIZ) 
programme of the Group of Specialists on Southern Ocean Ecology has 
established a Steering Committee for the programme. The programme aims to 
improve our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Antarctic 
Coastal and Shelf Ecosystem (ACSE), the most complex and productive 
ecosystem in Antarctica, and likely the one most sensitive to global 
environmental change. Particular attention will be paid to those features that 
make the biology of this ice-dominated ecosystem so distinctive, and to 
understanding seasonal, inter-annual and long-term changes.

The unique character of CS-EASIZ is its coherent approach to the ecology of the 
coastal and shelf marine ecosystem, integrating work on the ice, water-column 
and benthic sub-systems. It will form a potentially major input to the 
GLOCHANT programme, interface easily with SO-JGOFS and SO-GLOBEC and 
relate closely to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) 
Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) programme.

The first field data under the programme were collected during the 1995-96 
austr[?]al summer season. In particular, there was an EASIZ-dedicated cruise by 
MV Polarstern in the Weddell Sea during January and February 1996.  A 
dedicated cruise has also been scheduled for the 1996-97 season, and a timetable 
of workshops and symposia has been proposed.

The Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) 
organized its first international field programme in 1995-96. A group of 
scientists from Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, hosted by the 
Italian Antarctic Programme worked at Edmonson Point in the Ross Sea on the 
effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on terrestrial organisms.

8. Earth Sciences

The VIIth International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences was held in 
Siena, Italy, during September 1995 and attracted more than 200 participants. It 
was encouraging to note the number of younger scientists participating and the 
new techniques that are being brought to bear on the solution of Antarctic 
geological and geophysical problems.

The Antarctic Offshore Acoustic Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) programme also 
held a meeting in Siena, immediately following the Earth Sciences Symposium. 
The purpose of this meeting was to identify potential sites in the Southern Ocean 
for the Ocean Drilling Programme (ODP).

The Cape Roberts Project is a multi-national project being coordinated by New 
Zealand scientists that aims to recover up to 1,500 m of drill core from 
sedimentary strata beneath the sea floor off Cape Roberts at the south-western 
corner of the Ross Sea. The project will address two main themes: the early 
glacial history of Antarctic and its role in determining global sea-level changes; 
and the timing of rifting of the Antarctic continent in order to help understand 
the formation of the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Sea.

Following SCAR Recommendation XXIII-12, a workshop was held in Cambridge, 
United Kingdom, during May 1995, to consider all aspects of the reported 
subglacial lake beneath the deep ice-core drilling site at Vostok Station. The 
Workshop concluded that the current ice-core drilling should proceed but 
terminate at least 25 m above the

OPENING ADDRESS BY PROFESSOR A C ROCHA-CAMPOS,
PRESIDENT OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTIC RESEARCH

SCAR is pleased to participate in this meeting and looks forward to making a contribution towards its success. The SCAR activities since XIX ATCM have included the meeting of the SCAR Executive Committee in Siena, Italy 16-20 September 1995, meetings of some Groups of Specialists, a symposium and some workshops. The most important of these activities, including those relevant to the work of the Antarctic Treaty System, are reported here.

The Full Membership of SCAR has not changed but Colombia withdrew from Associate Membership of SCAR in April 1995. The closer relations with the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP) are strengthening cooperation, leading to more effective execution of scientific research in the Antarctic.

SCAR continues to be active in initiating, promoting and coordinating a diversity of scientific activities, but only a few can be briefly noted here

The SCAR Global Change Programme has re-focused its scientific priorities to concentrate on palaeoenvironmental records and ice sheet mass balance. The SCAR Global Change Programme Office has been established in the Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, University of Tasmania, Hobart, and a full-time Programme Coordinator is in post. In addition, the Programme Office is providing for other SCAR programmes that have a global change component. The Programme Office will also act as the formal institutional linkage between SCAR and International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) / World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) through the START framework, by taking on the role of the System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) Regional Committee for the Antarctic.

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation (GOSEAC) met in Christchurch, New Zealand, during June 1995 and will meet in Puerto Iguazu, Argentina, during June 1996. The work of GOSEAC is increasingly relevant to the Protocol
                                                           1
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  In 
conjunction with COMNAP, two workshops on environmental 
monitoring have been held in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995 
and in College Station, Texas, USA, during March 1996. SCAR 
strongly believes that the object of such monitoring should be to 
provide efficiently, effectively and at minimum cost, a continuing 
index of the health of the Antarctic terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems at both local and regional levels.

On the subject of Antarctic data management, the SCAR and 
COMNAP Executive Committees accepted the proposal from the 
International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research 
(ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand, to host and develop the 
Antarctic Master Directory (AMD). The project is being funded by a 
consortium of four countries and software development for the 
system is progressing well.

Other groups have been active. The SCAR Group of Specialists on 
Seals has developed a five-year programme on Antarctic Pack Ice 
Seal (APIS) and so far more than 40 research projects involving 
scientists from 18 nations have been identified under APIS.  A 
circumpolar survey of Antarctic pack ice seals is planned for the 
1998-99 Antarctic summer season. The Coastal and Shelf Ecology of 
the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (CS-EASIZ) programme, developed by 
the SCAR Group of Specialists on Southern Ocean Ecology 
(GOSSOE), is now in operation and the first season of field work has 
been undertaken. This programme is being closely supported by the 
SCAR Global Change Programme Office.

These are some of the highlights of SCAR's diverse activities.  In 
these and other ways SCAR wishes to maintain its input of advice 
to the Antarctic Treaty System.  However, I wish to emphasize again 
that SCAR's activities, in both basic and applied science, are 
inevitably constrained by financial limitations.  In particular, 
SCAR's applied role of providing scientific advice to the Antarctic 
Treaty would be even more effective if funding from the Antarctic 
Treaty System could be made available to support the meetings 
necessary to generate that advice.

SCAR REPORT TO XX ATCM
UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS
29 APRIL - 10 MAY 1996

1. INTRODUCTION

Since XIX ATCM in Seoul, May 1995, the SCAR Executive Committee has met
and some SCAR groups have held meetings. In addition, the President of SCAR
attended the annual meeting of COMNAP and the Chairman of COMNAP
attended the SCAR Executive Meeting, underlining the continuing cooperation
between the two organizations for the benefit of Antarctic science.

The membership of SCAR now comprises 25 Full Members and 7 Associate
Members (see Appendix 1). Unfortunately, Colombia withdrew from Associate
Membership of SCAR during the year. The membership of the Executive
Committee (Appendix 2) and the Chief Officers of SCAR subsidiary groups
(Appendix 3) are unchanged since XIX ATCM.

2. SCAR-COMNAP COOPERATION

SCAR and COMNAP continue to maintain routine contact through their
Secretariats. In addition, the President of SCAR attended the annual meeting of
COMNAP in Santiago, Chile, during August 1995 and the Chairman of
COMNAP attended the meeting of the SCAR Executive Committee in Siena,
Italy, during September 1995. A joint meeting of the SCAR and COMNAP
Executive Committees will be held during the XXIX SCAR meeting in
Cambridge, United Kingdom, during August 1996.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND CONSERVATION

The Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation held its
seventh meeting (GOSEAC VII) in Christchurch, New Zealand, during June 1995
and will meet again in Puerto Iguazu, Argentina, during June 1996. The meeting
discussed many topics including the planning of two joint SCAR-COMNAP
Workshops on environmental monitoring and a "Management Plan
Handbook" for protected areas. The two workshops have since taken place, the
first in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995, and the second at College Station,
Texas, USA, during March 1966. A brief account of these workshops is given in a
joint SCAR-COMNAP Information Paper and a full report and
recommendations will be available at XXI ATCM in Christchurch, New Zealand,
during 1997. Progress with the Handbook has been delayed and is not available
at this meeting as was originally intended. A complete draft will be considered at
                                                               3
GOSEAC VIII (June 1996) and this will be passed to SCAR for comment. It is 
intended that a final version should be tabled at XXI ATCM.

The meeting also considered checklists for environmental impact assessment in 
relation to four different scientific activities in the Antarctic: activities in near-
shore or shallow coastal areas; drilling in rock/soil/sediments; ice drilling; and 
seismic traverses [on land]. These checklists will be discussed by the relevant 
SCAR Working Groups during XXIV SCAR in Cambridge, United Kingdom, 
during August 1996.

4. ANTARCTIC DATA

The joint SCAR-COMNAP request for proposals to host the Antarctic Master 
Directory (AMD) and develop the Antarctic Data Directory System (ADDS) led to 
the proposal from the International Centre for Antarctic Information and 
Research (ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand being accepted by the SCAR and 
COMNAP Executive Committees. The project is being funded by a consortium 
of four countries working in the Ross Sea Sector: New Zealand, United States, 
Italy and France.  A Steering Committee has been established with 
representatives from the four funding partners, SCAR and COMNAP and held 
its first meeting in December 1995. ICAIR staff are currently developing the 
software necessary for operating the Directory System. Several SCAR countries 
have now identified their National Antarctic Data Centre (NADC) and will be 
providing data when requested.

5. THE ANTARCTIC AND GLOBAL CHANGE

The SCAR Global Change Programme Office has been established in the 
Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean 
Environment at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. This office is 
hosted by the Research Centre and a full-time Programme Coordinator has been 
appointed. The Programme Coordinator will be responsible for coordinating 
those aspects of all SCAR programmes that are collecting data relevant to global 
change studies and ensuring that other related international programmes are 
aware of these data.

The Group of Specialists has focused its programme on two major fields: "Global 
Palaeoenvironmental Records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and Marine and Land 
Sediments" and "Ice Sheet Mass Balance and Sea-Level". In the field of 
palaeoenvironmental records a strong link has been established with the Past 
Global Changes (PAGES) programme of IGBP that is examining global changes 
over the past 250.000 years. PAGES has joined with the SCAR group to 
formulate a coherent bi-polar attack in the future strategy for ice-coring.

Several national programmes are already collecting data that contribute to 
knowledge of the ice sheet mass balance. Remote-sensing is the principal 
method, using data from satellites and radio-echo sounding flights, but ground-
    4
truth data are also being collected. A major aim is to determine the ice-mass flux outward from the ice sheet across the grounding line into the ocean by the measurement of ice thickness around the entire Antarctic perimeter.

Other SCAR programmes, notably the Coastal and Shelf - Ecology of the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (CS-EASIZ) and the Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) have major components that are relevant to global change research. In addition the Group of Specialists is developing two new programmes that will be proposed to SCAR: Antarctic Sea-Ice Processes, Ecosystems and Climate (ASPECT) and Antarctic Ice Margin Evolution (ANTIME). ASPECT will examine how the ecosystems and climate are influenced by sea-ice processes whereas ANTIME will investigate fluctuation of the ice margin during the past 250,000 years as recorded in marine and terrestrial sediments.

In February 1996, the SCAR Global Change Programme Coordinator met with the IGBP Core Programme Directors to reach an understanding for the integration of Antarctic global change data into existing IGBP programmes as appropriate. This will lead to the SCAR Global Change Programme Office being recognized as the focal point for the Antarctic information and data exchange relevant to global change.

6. ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL SCIENCES

Monitoring of Antarctic ozone levels continues both from ground-based stations and from satellites. Recent results show that the springtime ozone depletion over the Antarctic is not deepening significantly from year to year although the area affected is greater in some years. The situation is forecast to continue for many years yet before a significant improvement is noted but scientists are reluctant to suggest that the trough of depletion has been reached. The scientific community continues to express its concerns about ozone depletion and notes that other compounds (such as methyl bromide) in addition to CFCs are now known to destroy ozone.

Workshops were held by the First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere (FROST) and the Antarctic Geospace Observatory Network (AGONET) programmes of the Working Groups on Physics and Chemistry of the Atmosphere and on Solar-Terrestrial and Astrophysical Research respectively. The FROST programme is yielding coordinated synoptic observations of the Antarctic troposphere for the first time and these are being used to compare weather prediction schemes over the Antarctic continent. Extra data fed into models for specific periods have indicated the reliability of forecasting. The programme has also highlighted the paucity of observing stations in the Pacific sector of Antarctica and the consequent data void for this region.

An AGONET database has been established, hosted by Italy, and geomagnetic and ionospheric data are being fed into the system from Antarctic observatories operated by more than seven countries. From a preliminary inspection of the data, specific periods are being selected for detailed study. A particular study aspect is the solar wind that has relevance to space weather and the US Space

5
Weather Initiative. Such studies can help to improve the cost-effectiveness of 
space satellite technology.

7. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES

Through its Antarctic Pack-Ice Seals (APIS) Programme, SCAR has developed a 
five-year programme of research on Antarctic pack-ice seals. This initiative, that 
originated with the SCAR Group of Specialists on Seals, aims to promote studies 
of the status of Antarctic pack-ice seal populations and the role they have in the 
Antarctic ecosystem. The data collected will provide vital information for the 
administration of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals 
(CCAS). To date, 41 research projects involving scientists from 18 nations have 
been identified under APIS. The programme plan includes a major proposal 
intends to carry out a circumpolar survey of Antarctic pack ice seals in the 
1998-99 field season and significant levels of ship support are being sought for 
this. The last planning meeting was held in Seattle during June 1995 and the 
next meeting will be in Cambridge during July 1996.

The APIS Programme can be expected to produce information of value to several 
Antarctic research programmes and inter-governmental organizations. These 
include CEP, CCAS, CCAMLR, (including CEMP), Southern Ocean - Global 
Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Research (SO-GLOBEC), Scientific Committee on 
Oceanic Research (SCOR), Southern Ocean - Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (SO-
JGOFS), SCAR-GLOCHANT, and International Whaling Commission (IWC).

The Coastal and Shelf - Ecology of the Antarctic Sea-Ice Zone (CS-EASIZ) 
programme of the Group of Specialists on Southern Ocean Ecology has 
established a Steering Committee for the programme. The programme aims to 
improve our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Antarctic 
Coastal and Shelf Ecosystem (ACSE), the most complex and productive 
ecosystem in Antarctica, and likely the one most sensitive to global 
environmental change. Particular attention will be paid to those features that 
make the biology of this ice-dominated ecosystem so distinctive, and to 
understanding seasonal, inter-annual and long-term changes.

The unique character of CS-EASIZ is its coherent approach to the ecology of the 
coastal and shelf marine ecosystem, integrating work on the ice, water-column 
and benthic sub-systems. It will form a potentially major input to the 
GLOCHANT programme, interface easily with SO-JGOFS and SO-GLOBEC and 
relate closely to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) 
Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) programme.

The first field data under the programme were collected during the 1995-96 
austral summer season. In particular, there was an EASIZ-dedicated cruise by 
MV Polarstern in the Weddell Sea during January and February 1996. A 
dedicated cruise has also been scheduled for the 1996-97 season, and a timetable 
of workshops and symposia has been proposed.

The Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) 
organized its first international field programme in 1995-96. A group of 
6
scientists from Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, hosted by the 
Italian Antarctic Programme worked at Edmonson Point in the Ross Sea on the 
effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on terrestrial organisms.

8. EARTH SCIENCES

The VIIth International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences was held in 
Siena, Italy, during September 1995 and attracted more than 200 participants. It 
was encouraging to note the number of younger scientists participating and the 
new techniques that are being brought to bear on the solution of Antarctic 
geological and geophysical problems.

The Antarctic Offshore Acoustic Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) programme also 
held a meeting in Siena, immediately following the Earth Sciences Symposium. 
The purpose of this meeting was to identify potential sites in the Southern Ocean 
for the Ocean Drilling Programme (ODP).

The Cape Roberts Project is a multi-national project being coordinated by New 
Zealand scientists that aims to recover up to 1,500 m of drill core from 
sedimentary strata beneath the sea floor off Cape Roberts at the south-western 
corner of the Ross Sea. The project will address two main themes: the early 
glacial history of Antarctic and its role in determining global sea-level changes; 
and the timing of rifting of the Antarctic continent in order to help understand 
the formation of the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Sea.

Following SCAR Recommendation XXIII-12, a workshop was held in Cambridge, 
United Kingdom, during May 1995, to consider all aspects of the reported 
subglacial lake beneath the deep ice-core drilling site at Vostok Station. The 
Workshop concluded that the current ice-core drilling should proceed but 
terminate at least 25 m above the ice-water interface, and should not penetrate 
the water beneath the ice.

9. RECENT SCAR PUBLICATIONS
