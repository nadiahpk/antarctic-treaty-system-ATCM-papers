OPENING ADDRESS BY AMBASSADOR WANJA TORNBERG
Head of the Delegation of Sweden

On behalf of the Delegation of Sweden may I congratulate you on
your election to the chair of this Consultative Meeting and wish
you good luck and a successful conference. My delegation would
also like to thank the Government of the Netherlands for their
hospitality and for their efficient and impressive organization
that we have already been able to appreciate.

• The Protocol on Environmental Protection has now been ratified
by most Parties and we hope that the remaining few will soon be
able to do so. There are, however, also some States that still
have not given effect to the obligation of the Protocol in their
domestic law. We must make sure that our concern for the
Antarctic environment can be used in developing processes to put
the Protocol in practice. - While the TEWG is a step in the right
direction we do want to see continuing progress on the practical
and technical issues of the Protocol.

• The Parties need some kind of interim arrangements to provide
secretariat services until a Secretariat can be established. This
is essential to e.g. give the TEWG and afterwards the CEP
necessary support.

• The development of a Liability Annex has taken several steps
forward under the skilful and efficient chairmanship of Professor
Rüdiger Wolfrum from Germany - Sweden would like to see a strong
liability regime with as few exceptions as possible. There are,
however, still fundamental differences between the Parties
concerning the content of the regime. It is important to keep the
momentum and Sweden supports the set up of a timetable for the
future work. The expert group should be moving to prepare a first
draft negotiating text, when a diplomatic conference could be
called.

The protection of the environment is an issue of great concern.
The interest in environmental issues should benefit the 
scientific activities in the Antarctic Treaty area. As Antarctica 
e.g. has some of the more vital clues for the knowledge of the 
global environment.

Concluding we reiterate our pleasure to be here in the very 
friendly town of Utrecht and our commitment to cooperation to 
ensuring the success of this meeting.
