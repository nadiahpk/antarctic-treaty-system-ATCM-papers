CONTIGENCY PLANNING

REF.: Item 16 paragraph (a), of the Provisional Agenda of the XX ATCM
(Information Paper)

With regard to what was estabilished by ATCM Rec. XV - 04 and further
COMNAP meetings, with the intention of each Consultative Party of the Antarctic
Treaty elaborating a Contingency Plan to enclose oil spills, the Brazilian Antarctic
Program (PROANTAR) has been working on it, since then, with the purpose of
obtaining the necessary information and knowledge in order to conform to the
approved recommendations.

With this purpose in mind, technical consultations were done with some
institutions that have know-how in this area, such as the Oceanographic Institute of the
University of São Paulo (IO/USP), and the Brazilian Petroleum Company
(PETROBRÁS), in order to collect the necessary information to elaborate the
Contingency Plan for Oil Spills at Antarctic Station "Comandante Ferraz" (EACF).
During 1993, a human resources training program was formed. A member of
PROANTAR took part in a course on the Techniques of Enclosure and Recovery of
Oil Spills on Water Surfaces, provided by PETROBRÁS, in order to spread
knowledge about this subject. It is part of the annual plan to prepare the Support
Group of Antarctic Station "Comandante Ferraz" (EACF), for the Officer-in-charge
of the Station to take part in the above mentioned course.

Concerning possible chemical spillage or leakage of radioisotopes and
considering the variety of these substances, the PROANTAR suggests that the best
way to reduce the environmental risks and to proceed in these cases is to develop
actions for each specific substance.

In order to implement the Contingency Plan for Oil Spills, the following items
were acquired for the EACF:

- Brazilian Antarctic Program                                         1
a) 10 ALPINA SEAFENCE 14 PU-EX barriers, equipped with two floating adaptors for towing, in sections measuring 15 meters each, which are used to enclose oil spills in the sea or oil spills that occur on land, but flow into the sea;
b) 450 meters of SPILLSORB B-8 absorbing barriers, to be used for small spills in the sea, spills inside buildings, and spills over the oil boat.
c) 500 metres of SPILLSORB S absorbing cover, to be used for the absorption of oil spills enclosed inside the ALPINA barriers or in the absorbing barriers, the absorption of oil spills inside buildings and over the oil boat, and the absorption of small oil spills and to help with the cleaning of the oil spilled.

The Officer-in-charge of the EACF took part in the meetings at Base "Presidente Eduardo Frei" (Chile) , in February 1994 and in January 1995, which brought together other Chiefs of Bases and Stations of the area (King George Island), with the purpose of producing suggestions for the Managers of the National Antarctic Programs, about possible joint measures to combat pollution.
