REPORTING OF TOURIST AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA

At the last two Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, the Antarctic Tr aty parties agreed on 
the reporting requirements for tourist and non-governmental expedi ions - for Advance 
Notification (see Attachment A to Recommendation XVIII-1, Kyoto 19'14) and for Post-Visit 
Reporting (Resolution 3 (1995), Seoul 1995).

2    Discussion at ATCM XIX resulted from a Working Paper (ATC 1S/WP 6) presented by 
Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This Working Paper included draft 
formats for data collection which were developed over several years f llowing international 
consultation. The drafts were presented as a basis for seeking internatic nal agreement on the 
content and format of tourism data collection fc rms.

3    Standardised reporting would allow dsta gathered to be internat onally consistent and 
comparable and facilitate the ease of use by the tour industry which has been faced with 
requests for data in a variety of formats.

4    It was subsequently agreed at ATCM XIX that, in principle, there would be an 
advantage in standardising reporting of information. It was noted that th: information required 
should not exceed that which is required in Recommendation XVIII-1 an I Resolution 3 (1995). 
New Zealand undertook to make further refiner ents to the proposed stan lard format and report 
back to ATCM XX.

5    New Zealand has adopted practical forms for Advance Notifi ation and Post-Visit 
Reports (attached) which are considered as meeting national obligat ions in fulfilling the 
requirements of Recommendation XVIII-1 and Resolution 3 (1995'. These forms are 
distributed to tour operators working out of or passing through New  iealand to Antarctica. 
These forms have much in common with other forms currently in use.

6    It is hoped that a precise definition of data that might find accept ince by Treaty Parties 
can be agreed in the near future. The forms New Zealand has adopted are available to assist 
deliberations in this regard.

7    Paragraph 56 of the Final Report of ACTM XIX also noted that t ur information would 
benefit from compilation into an internationally accessible database. Ag eement on data needs 
and a standard definition of data for collection are the first fund umental steps toward 
compilation of such an internationally accessible database.

8    A model procedure to establish and operate an international dati base may be found in 
the Treaty and SCAR/COMNAP initiative to establish and operate the A itarctic Data Directory 
System (ADDS). In this case, a consortium of Parties is establishing and funding a Master 
Directory of the ADDS, which will be made accessible over the Interne!, on disk and in paper 
form to interested groups. It is suggested that tourism data could be made accessible in a 
similar way. Alternative approaches to funding the system, perhaps invc lving the tour industry 
itself, could be explored.
