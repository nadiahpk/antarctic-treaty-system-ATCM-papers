AND NOXIOUS SUBSTANCES BY SEA, 1996

Texts examined and approved by the Drafting Committee

THE STATES PARTIES TO THE PRESENT CONVENTION,

CONSCIOUS of the dangers posed by the world-wide carriage by sea of hazardous and noxious
substances,

CONVINCED of the need to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is
available to persons who suffer damage caused by incidents in connection with the carriage by sea of
such substances,

DESIRING to adopt uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of
liability and compensation in respect of such damage,

CONSIDERING that the economic consequences of damage caused by the carriage by sea of
hazardous and noxious substances should be shared by the shipping industry and the cargo interests
involved,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

I:\CONF\LEG\DC.4
For reasons of economy, this document is printed in a limited number. Delegates are
kindly asked to bring their copies to meetings and not to request additional copies.

    operated by a company which in that State is registered as the ship's operator, "owner" shall mean such
    company.

4   "Receiver" means either:

    (a)     the person who physically receives contributing cargo discharged  in the ports and
            terminals of a State Party; provided that if at the time of receipt the person who
            physically receives the cargo acts as an agent for another who is subject to the
            jurisdiction of any State Party, then the principal shall be deemed to be the receiver, if
            the agent discloses the principal to the HNS Fund; or

    (b)     the person in the State Party who in accordance with the national law of that State Party
            is deemed to be the receiver of contributing cargo discharged in the ports and terminals
            of a State Party, provided that the total contributing cargo received according to such
            national law is substantially the same as that which would have been received under (a).

5   "Hazardous and noxious substances" (HNS) means:

                    substances and mixtures provisionally categorized as falling in pollution category
                    A, B, C or D in accordance with regulation 3(4) of the said Annex II;

            (iii)   dangerous liquid substances carried in bulk listed in chapter 17 of the

2      Where two neighbouring States agree that this Convention does not apply also to ships which are 
       covered by paragraph 1(a) and (b) while engaged on voyages between ports or facilities of those States, 
       the States concerned may declare that the exclusion from the application of this Convention declared

                       under paragraph 2, of either of them; or

               (ii)    the exclusive economic zone, or area mentioned in article 3(b), of the State or

Chapter II

LIABILITY

Liability of the owner

Article 7

1    Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3, the owner at the time of an incident shall be liable for damage caused by any hazardous and noxious substances in connection with their carriage by sea on board the ship, provided that if an incident consists of a series of occurrences having the same origin the liability shall attach to the owner at the time of the first of such occurrences.

2    No liability shall attach to the owner if the owner proves that:

     (a)    the damage resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character; or

     (b)    the damage was wholly caused by an act or omission done with the intent to cause damage by a third party; or

     (c)    the damage was wholly caused by the negligence or other wrongful act of any Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function; or

     (d)    the failure of the shipper or any other person to furnish information concerning the hazardous and noxious nature of the substances shipped either

            (i)     has caused the damage, wholly or partly; or

            (ii)    has led the owner not to obtain insurance in accordance with article 12;

     provided that neither the owner nor its servants or agents knew or ought reasonably to have known of the hazardous and noxious nature of the substances shipped.

3    If the owner proves that the damage resulted wholly or partly either from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage by the person who suffered the damage or from the negligence of that person, the owner may be exonerated wholly or partially from liability to such person.

4    No claim for compensation for damage shall be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention.

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                                  - 8 -

5        Subject to paragraph 6, no claim for compensation for damage under this Convention or
         otherwise may be made against:

         (a)     the servants or agents of the owner or the members of the crew;

         (b)     the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew, performs services 
                 for the ship;

         (c)     any charterer (howsoever described, including a bareboat charterer), manager or 
                 operator of the ship;

         (d)     any person performing salvage operations with the consent of the owner or on the 
                 instructions of a competent public authority;

         (e)     any person taking preventive measures; and

         (f)     the servants or agents of persons mentioned in (c), (d) and (e);

         unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such
         damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.

6        Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any existing right of recourse of the owner against any 
         third party, including, but not limited to, the shipper or the receiver of the substance causing the damage,
         or the persons indicated in paragraph 5.

         Incidents involving two or more ships

         Article 8

1        Whenever damage has resulted from an incident involving two or more ships each of which is 
         carrying hazardous and noxious substances, each owner, unless exonerated under article 7, shall be liable 
         for the damage. The owners shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage which is not 
         reasonably separable.

2        However, owners shall be entitled to the limits of liability applicable to each of them under 
         article 9.

3        Nothing in this article shall prejudice any right of recourse of an owner against any other owner.

         Limitation of liability

         Article 9

1        The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit liability under this Convention in respect of any one 
         incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows:

         (a)     10 million units of account for a ship not exceeding 2,000 units of tonnage; and

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
- 9 -                                          LEG/CONF.10/DC.4

(b)      for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that
         mentioned in (a):

         for each unit of tonnage from 2,001 to 50,000 units of tonnage, 1,500 units of account

         for each unit of tonnage in excess of 50,000 units of tonnage, 360 units of account

         provided, however, that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 100 million units of account.

2        The owner shall not be entitled to limit liability under this Convention if it is proved that the
         damage resulted from the personal act or omission of the owner, committed with the intent to cause such
         damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.

3        The owner shall, for the purpose of benefitting from the limitation provided for in paragraph 1, constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of liability established in accordance with
         paragraph 1 with the court or other competent authority of any one of the States Parties in which action
         is brought under article 38 or, if no action is brought, with any court or other competent authority in any
         one of the States Parties in which an action can be brought under article 38. The fund can be constituted
         either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the
         law of the State Party where the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by the court or other
         competent authority.

4        Subject to the provisions of article 11, the fund shall be distributed among the claimants in
         proportion to the amounts of their established claims.

5        If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of the servants or agents of the owner or any
         person providing to the owner insurance or other financial security has as a result of the incident in
         question, paid compensation for damage, such person shall, up to the amount that person has paid,
         acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this
         Convention.

6        The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 5 may also be exercised by a person other than
         those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of compensation for damage which such person may
         have paid but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.

7        Where owners or other persons establish that they may be compelled to pay at a later date in
         whole or in part any such amount of compensation, with regard to which the right of subrogation would
         have been enjoyed under paragraphs 5 or 6 had the compensation been paid before the fund was
         distributed, the court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may
         order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to
         enforce the claim against the fund.

8        Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner
         voluntarily to prevent or minimize damage shall rank equally with other claims against the fund.

9        (a)    The amounts mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency on
         the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the
         constitution of the fund referred to in paragraph 3. The value of the national currency, in terms of the
         Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of
         the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of
         valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                                  - 10 -

its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the 
Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International 
Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.

(b)    Nevertheless, a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund 
and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(a) may, 
at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at 
any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 9(a) shall be 
equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to 
sixty-five-and-a-half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The 
conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law 
of the State concerned.

(c)    The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 9(a) and the conversion 
mentioned in paragraph 9(b) shall be made in such manner as to express in the national 
currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in 
paragraph 1 as would result from the application of the first two sentences of 
paragraph 9(a). States Parties shall communicate to the Secretary-General the manner 
of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(a), or the result of the conversion in 
paragraph 9(b) as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, 
acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change 
in either.

10     For the purpose of this article the ship's tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in 
accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in Annex I of the International 
Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.

11     The insurer or other person providing financial security shall be entitled to constitute a fund in 
accordance with this article on the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were constituted 
by the owner. Such a fund may be constituted even if, under the provisions of paragraph 2, the owner 
is not entitled to limitation of liability, but its constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any 
claimant against the owner.

                                                   Article 10

1      Where the owner, after an incident, has constituted a fund in accordance with article 9 and is 
entitled to limit liability:

       (a)    no person having a claim for damage arising out of that incident shall be entitled to 
              exercise any right against any other assets of the owner in respect of such claim; and

       (b)    the court or other competent authority of any State Party shall order the release of any 
              ship or other property belonging to the owner which has been arrested in respect of a 
              claim for damage arising out of that incident, and shall similarly release any bail or other 
              security furnished to avoid such arrest.

2      The foregoing shall, however, only apply if the claimant has access to the court administering 
the fund and the fund is actually available in respect of the claim.

Death and injury

Article 11

Claims in respect of death or personal injury have priority over other claims save to the extent 
that the aggregate of such claims exceeds two thirds of the total amount established in accordance with 
article 9, paragraph 1.

Compulsory insurance of the owner

Article 12

1       The owner of a ship registered in a State Party and actually carrying hazardous and noxious 
substances shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of 
a bank or similar financial institution, in the sums fixed by applying the limits of liability prescribed in 
article 9, paragraph 1, to cover liability for damage under this Convention.

2       A compulsory insurance certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force 
in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate 
authority of a State Party has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. 
With respect to a ship registered in a State Party such compulsory insurance certificate shall be issued 
or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not 
registered in a State Party it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any State Party. 
This compulsory insurance certificate shall be in the form of the model set out in Annex I and shall 
contain the following particulars:

        (a)     name of the ship, distinctive number or letters and port of registry;

        (b)     name and principal place of business of the owner;

        (c)     IMO ship identification number;

        (d)     type and duration of security;

        (e)     name and principal place of business of insurer or other person giving security and, 
                where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or security is established; and

        (f)     period of validity of certificate, which shall not be longer than the period of validity of 
                the insurance or other security.

3       The compulsory insurance certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing 
State. If the language used is neither English, nor French nor Spanish, the text shall include a translation 
into one of these languages.

4       The compulsory insurance certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be 
deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered 
in a State Party, with the authority of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.

5       An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this article if it can 
cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                                  - 12 -

the certificate under paragraph 2, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its 
termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 4, unless the compulsory insurance 
certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any 
modification which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this 
article.

6        The State of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this article, determine the 
conditions of issue and validity of the compulsory insurance certificate.

7        Compulsory insurance certificates issued or certified under the authority of a State Party in 
accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other States Parties for the purposes of this Convention 
and shall be regarded by other States Parties as having the same force as compulsory insurance 
certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a 
State Party. A State Party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should 
it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the compulsory insurance certificate is not financially 
capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.

8        Any claim for compensation for damage may be brought directly against the insurer or other 
person providing financial security for the owner's liability for damage. In such case the defendant may, 
even if the owner is not entitled to limitation of liability, benefit from the limit of liability prescribed 
in accordance with paragraph 1. The defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the 
bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the owner would have been entitled to invoke. 
Furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct 
of the owner, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been 
entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the owner against the defendant. The defendant shall in any 
event have the right to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.

9        Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with 
paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention.

10       A State Party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this article applies to trade unless a 
certificate has been issued under paragraph 2 or 12.

11       Subject to the provisions of this article, each State Party shall ensure, under its national law, that 
insurance or other security in the sums specified in paragraph 1 is in force in respect of any ship, 
wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving an offshore facility 
in its territorial sea.

12       If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a State 
Party, the provisions of this article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall 
carry a compulsory insurance certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship's 
registry stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the ship's liability is covered within the limit 
prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. Such a compulsory insurance certificate shall follow as 
closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2.

Chapter III

COMPENSATION BY THE INTERNATIONAL HAZARDOUS 
AND NOXIOUS SUBSTANCES FUND (HNS FUND)

Establishment of the HNS Fund

Article 13

1     The International Hazardous and Noxious Substances Fund (HNS Fund) is hereby established 
      with the following aims:

      (a)    to provide compensation for damage in connection with the carriage of hazardous and 
             noxious substances by sea, to the extent that the protection afforded by chapter II is 
             inadequate or not available; and

      (b)    to give effect to the related tasks set out in article 15.

2     The HNS Fund shall in each State Party be recognized as a legal person capable under the laws 
      of that State of assuming rights and obligations and of being a party in legal proceedings before the courts 
      of that State. Each State Party shall recognize the Director as the legal representative of the HNS Fund.

Compensation

Article 14

1     For the purpose of fulfilling its function under article 13, paragraph 1(a), the HNS Fund shall pay 
      compensation to any person suffering damage if such person has been unable to obtain full and adequate 
      compensation for the damage under the terms of chapter II:

      (a)    because no liability for the damage arises under chapter II;

      (b)    because the owner liable for the damage under chapter II is financially incapable of 
             meeting the obligations under this Convention in full and any financial security that may 
             be provided under chapter II does not cover or is insufficient to satisfy the claims for 
             compensation for damage; an owner being treated as financially incapable of meeting 
             these obligations and a financial security being treated as insufficient if the person 
             suffering the damage has been unable to obtain full satisfaction of the amount of 
             compensation due under chapter II after having taken all reasonable steps to pursue the 
             available legal remedies;

      (c)    because the damage exceeds the owner's liability under the terms of chapter II.

2     Expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent 
      or minimize damage shall be treated as damage for the purposes of this article.


I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                  - 14 -

3        The HNS Fund shall incur no obligation under the preceding paragraphs if:

         (a)     it proves that the damage resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war or insurrection
                 or was caused by hazardous and noxious substances which had escaped or been
                 discharged from a warship or other ship owned or operated by a State and used at the
                 time of the incident, only on Government non-commercial service; or

         (b)     the claimant cannot prove that there is a reasonable probability that the damage resulted
                 from an incident involving one or more ships.

4        If the HNS Fund proves that the damage resulted wholly or partly either from an act or omission
         done with intent to cause damage by the person who suffered the damage or from the negligence of that
         person, the HNS Fund may be exonerated wholly or partially from its obligation to pay compensation
         to such person. The HNS Fund shall in any event be exonerated to the extent that the owner may have
         been exonerated under article 7, paragraph 3. However, there shall be no such exoneration of the
         HNS Fund with regard to preventive measures.

5        (a)    Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (b), the aggregate amount of compensation
                 payable by the HNS Fund under this article shall in respect of any one incident be
                 limited, so that the total sum of that amount and any amount of compensation actually
                 paid under chapter II for damage within the scope of application of this Convention as
                 defined in article 3 shall not exceed 250 million units of account.

         (b)     The aggregate amount of compensation payable by the HNS Fund under this article for
                 damage resulting from a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible
                 character shall not exceed 250 million units of account.

         (c)     Interest accrued on a fund constituted in accordance with article 9, paragraph 3, if any,
                 shall not be taken into account for the computation of the maximum compensation
                 payable by the HNS Fund under this article.

         (d)     The amounts mentioned in this article shall be converted into national currency on the
                 basis of the value of that currency with reference to the Special Drawing Right on the
                 date of the decision of the Assembly of the HNS Fund as to the first date of payment of
                 compensation.

6        Where the amount of established claims against the HNS Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of
         compensation payable under paragraph 5, the amount available shall be distributed in such a manner that
         the proportion between any established claim and the amount of compensation actually recovered by the
         claimant under this Convention shall be the same for all claimants. Claims in respect of death or personal
         injury shall have priority over other claims, however, save to the extent that the aggregate of such claims
         exceeds two-thirds of the total amount established in accordance with paragraph 5.

7        The Assembly of the HNS Fund may decide that, in exceptional cases, compensation in
         accordance with this Convention can be paid even if the owner of the ship has not constituted a fund in
         accordance with chapter II. In such cases paragraph 5(d) applies accordingly.

Subject to article 19, paragraph 6, the general account shall be available to compensate damage caused by hazardous and noxious substances covered by that account, and a separate account shall be available to compensate damage caused by a hazardous and noxious substance covered by that account.

5    For the purposes of article 18, article 19, paragraph 1(a)(i), paragraph 1(a)(ii) and paragraph 1(c), article 20 and article 21, paragraph 5, where the quantity of a given type of contributing cargo received in the territory of a State Party by any person in a calendar year when aggregated with the quantities of the same type of cargo received in the same State Party in that year by any associated person or persons exceeds the limit specified in the respective subparagraphs, such a person shall pay contributions in respect of the actual quantity received by that person notwithstanding that that quantity did not exceed the respective limit.

6    "Associated person" means any subsidiary or commonly controlled entity. The question whether a person comes within this definition shall be determined by the national law of the State concerned.

                        General provisions on annual contributions

                                   Article 17

1    Annual contributions to the general account and to each separate account shall be levied only as required to make payments by the account in question.

2    Annual contributions payable pursuant to articles 18, 19 and article 21, paragraph 5 shall be determined by the Assembly and shall be calculated in accordance with those articles on the basis of the units of contributing cargo received or, in respect of cargoes referred to in article 19, paragraph 1(b), discharged during the preceding calendar year or such other year as the Assembly may decide.

3    The Assembly shall decide the total amount of annual contributions to be levied to the general account and to each separate account. Following that decision the Director shall, in respect of each State Party, calculate for each person liable to pay contributions in accordance with article 18, article 19, paragraph 1 and article 21, paragraph 5, the amount of that person's annual contribution to each account, on the basis of a fixed sum for each unit of contributing cargo reported in respect of the person during the preceding calendar year or such other year as the Assembly may decide. For the general account, the above-mentioned fixed sum per unit of contributing cargo for each sector shall be calculated pursuant to the regulations contained in Annex II to this Convention. For each separate account, the fixed sum per unit of contributing cargo referred to above shall be calculated by dividing the total annual contribution to be levied to that account by the total quantity of cargo contributing to that account.

(Agenda item 6b)

(Submitted by the Netherlands)
- 19 -
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4

Initial contributions

Article 20

1     In respect of each State Party, initial contributions shall be made of an amount which shall for 
each person liable to pay contributions in accordance with article 16, paragraph 5, articles 18, 19 and 
article 21, paragraph 5 be calculated on the basis of a fixed sum, equal for the general account and each 
separate account, for each unit of contributing cargo received or, in the case of LNG, discharged in that 
State, during the calendar year preceding that in which this Convention enters into force for that State.

2     The fixed sum and the units for the different sectors within the general account as well as for each 
separate account referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined by the Assembly.

3     Initial contributions shall be paid within 3 months following the date on which the HNS Fund 
issues invoices in respect of each State Party to persons liable to pay contributions in accordance with 
paragraph 1.

Reports

Article 21

1     Each State Party shall ensure that any person liable to pay contributions in accordance with 
articles 18, 19 or paragraph 5 of this article appears on a list to be established and kept up to date by the 
Director in accordance with the provisions of this article.

2     For the purposes set out in paragraph 1, each State Party shall communicate to the Director, at a 
time and in the manner to be prescribed in the internal regulations of the HNS Fund, the name and 
address of any person who in respect of the State is liable to pay contributions in accordance with articles 
18, 19 or paragraph 5 of this article, as well as data on the relevant quantities of contributing cargo for 
which such a person is liable to contribute in respect of the preceding calendar year.

3     For the purposes of ascertaining who are, at any given time, the persons liable to pay 
contributions in accordance with articles 18, 19 or paragraph 5 of this article and of establishing, where 
applicable, the quantities of cargo to be taken into account for any such person when determining the 
amount of the contribution, the list shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

4     Where a State Party does not fulfil its obligations to communicate to the Director the information 
referred to in paragraph 2 and this results in a financial loss for the HNS Fund, that State Party shall be 
liable to compensate the HNS Fund for such loss. The Assembly shall, on the recommendation of the 
Director, decide whether such compensation shall be payable by a State Party.

5     In respect of contributing cargo carried from one port or terminal of a State Party to another port 
or terminal located in the same State and discharged there, States Parties shall have the option of 
submitting to the HNS Fund a report with an annual aggregate quantity for each account covering all 
receipts of contributing cargo, including any quantities in respect of which contributions are payable 
pursuant to article 16, paragraph 5. The State Party shall, at the time of reporting, either:

(a)    notify the HNS Fund that that State will pay the aggregate amount for each account in 
respect of the relevant year in one lump sum to the HNS Fund; or

I:CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                                  - 20 -

(b)      instruct the HNS Fund to levy the aggregate amount for each account by invoicing 
         individual receivers or, in the case of LNG, the title holder who discharges within the 
         jurisdiction of that State Party, for the amount payable by each of them. These persons 
         shall be identified in accordance with the national law of the State concerned.

Non-payment of contributions

Article 22

1        The amount of any contribution due under articles 18, 19, 20 or article 21, paragraph 5 and which 
         is in arrears shall bear interest at a rate which shall be determined in accordance with the internal 
         regulations of the HNS Fund, provided that different rates may be fixed for different circumstances.

2        Where a person who is liable to pay contributions in accordance with articles 18, 19, 20 
         or article 21, paragraph 5 does not fulfil the obligations in respect of any such contribution or any part 
         thereof and is in arrears, the Director shall take all appropriate action, including court action, against such 
         a person on behalf of the HNS Fund with a view to the recovery of the amount due. However, where the 
         defaulting contributor is manifestly insolvent or the circumstances otherwise so warrant, the Assembly 
         may, upon recommendation of the Director, decide that no action shall be taken or continued against the 
         contributor.

Optional liability of States Parties for the payment of contributions

         assumes responsibility for obligations imposed by this Convention on any person liable to pay 
         contributions in accordance with articles 18, 19, 20 or article 21, paragraph 5 in respect of hazardous and 
         noxious substances received or discharged in the territory of that State. Such a declaration shall be made 
         in writing and shall specify which obligations are assumed.

2        Where a declaration under paragraph 1 is made prior to the entry into force of this Convention 
         in accordance with article 46, it shall be deposited with the Secretary-General who shall after the entry 
         into force of this Convention communicate the declaration to the Director.

3        A declaration under paragraph 1 which is made after the entry into force of this Convention shall 
         be deposited with the Director.

4        A declaration made in accordance with this article may be withdrawn by the relevant State giving 
         notice thereof in writing to the Director. Such a notification shall take effect three months after the 
         Director's receipt thereof.

5        Any State which is bound by a declaration made under this article shall, in any proceedings 
         brought against it before a competent court in respect of any obligation specified in the declaration, waive 
         any immunity that it would otherwise be entitled to invoke.

Jurisdiction in respect of action against the owner

Article 38

1      Where an incident has caused damage in the territory, including the territorial sea or in an area 
       referred to in article 3(b), of one or more States Parties, or preventive measures have been taken to 
       prevent or minimize damage in such territory including the territorial sea or in such area, actions for 
       compensation may be brought against the owner or other person providing financial security for the 
       owner's liability only in the courts of any such States Parties.

2      Where an incident has caused damage exclusively outside the territory, including the territorial 
       sea, of any State and either the conditions for application of this Convention set out in article 3(c) have 
       been fulfilled or preventive measures to prevent or minimize such damage have been taken, actions for 
       compensation may be brought against the owner or other person providing financial security for the 
       owner's liability only in the courts of:

       (a)    the State Party where the ship is registered or, in the case of an unregistered ship, the 
              State Party whose flag the ship is entitled to fly; or

       (b)    the State Party where the owner has habitual residence or where the principal place of 
              business of the owner is established; or

       (c)    the State Party where a fund has been constituted in accordance with article 9, 
              paragraph 3.

3      Reasonable notice of any action taken under paragraph 1 or 2 shall be given to the defendant.

4      Each State Party shall ensure that its courts have jurisdiction to entertain actions for compensation 
       under this Convention.

5      After a fund under article 9 has been constituted by the owner or by the insurer or other person 
       providing financial security in accordance with article 12, the courts of the State in which such fund is 
       constituted shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all matters relating to the apportionment and 
       distribution of the fund.

       Jurisdiction in respect of action against the HNS Fund or taken by the HNS Fund

Article 39

1      Subject to the subsequent provisions of this article, any action against the HNS Fund for 
       compensation under article 14 shall be brought only before a court having jurisdiction under article 38 
       in respect of actions against the owner who is liable for damage caused by the relevant incident or before 
       a court in a State Party which would have been competent if an owner had been liable.

2      In the event that the ship carrying the hazardous or noxious substances which caused the damage 
       has not been identified, the provisions of article 38, paragraph 1, should be applied mutatis mutandis to 
       actions against the HNS Fund.

3      Each State Party shall ensure that its courts have jurisdiction to entertain such actions against the 
       HNS Fund as are referred to in paragraph 1.

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4

4        Where an action for compensation for damage has been brought before a court against the owner 
         or the owner's guarantor, such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action against the HNS 
         Fund for compensation under the provisions of article 14 in respect of the same damage.

5        Each State Party shall ensure that the HNS Fund shall have the right to intervene as a party to any 
         legal proceedings instituted in accordance with this Convention before a competent court of that State 
         against the owner or the owner's guarantor.

6        Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7, the HNS Fund shall not be bound by any judgement 
         or decision in proceedings to which it has not been a party or by any settlement to which it is not a party.

7        Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 5, where an action under this Convention for 
         compensation for damage has been brought against an owner or the owner's guarantor before a competent 
         court in a State Party, each party to the proceedings shall be entitled under the national law of that State 
         to notify the HNS Fund of the proceedings. Where such notification has been made in accordance 
         with the formalities required by the law of the court seized and in such time and in such a manner that 
         the HNS Fund has in fact been in a position effectively to intervene as a party to the proceedings, any 
         judgement rendered by the court in such proceedings shall, after it has become final and enforceable in 
         the State where the judgement was given, become binding upon the HNS Fund in the sense that the facts 
         and findings in that judgement may not be disputed by the HNS Fund even if the HNS Fund has not 
         actually intervened in the proceedings.

                                                     Recognition and enforcement

1        Any judgement given by a court with jurisdiction in accordance with article 38, which is 
         enforceable in the State of origin where it is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be 
         recognized in any State Party, except:

         (a)      where the judgement was obtained by fraud; or

         (b)      where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair opportunity to present the 
                  case.

2        A judgement recognized under paragraph 1 shall be enforceable in each State Party as soon as 
         the formalities required in that State have been complied with. The formalities shall not permit the merits 
         of the case to be re-opened.

3        Subject to any decision concerning the distribution referred to in article 14, paragraph 6, any 
         judgement given against the HNS Fund by a court having jurisdiction in accordance with article 39, 
         paragraphs 1 and 3 shall, when it has become enforceable in the State of origin and is in that State no 
         longer subject to ordinary forms of review, be recognized and enforceable in each State Party.

Subrogation and recourse

Article 41

1    The HNS Fund shall, in respect of any amount of compensation for damage paid by the 
     HNS Fund in accordance with article 14, paragraph 1, acquire by subrogation the rights that the person 
     so compensated may enjoy against the owner or the owner's guarantor.

2    Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any rights of recourse or subrogation of the HNS Fund 
     against any person, including persons referred to in article 7, paragraph 2(d), other than those referred 
     to in the previous paragraph, in so far as they can limit their liability. In any event the right of the HNS 
     Fund to subrogation against such persons shall not be less favourable than that of an insurer of the person 
     to whom compensation has been paid.

3    Without prejudice to any other rights of subrogation or recourse against the HNS Fund which 
     may exist, a State Party or agency thereof which has paid compensation for damage in accordance with 
     provisions of national law shall acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would 
     have enjoyed under this Convention.

Supersession clause

Article 42

This Convention shall supersede any convention in force or open for signature, ratification or 
accession at the date on which this Convention is opened for signature, but only to the extent that such

8        Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be notified by the Organization 
to all Contracting States. The amendment shall be deemed to have been accepted at the end of a period 
of eighteen months after the date of notification, unless within that period no less than one-fourth of the 
States which were Contracting States at the time of the adoption of the amendment have communicated 
to the Secretary-General that they do not accept the amendment, in which case the amendment is rejected 
and shall have no effect.

9        An amendment deemed to have been accepted in accordance with paragraph 8 shall enter into 
force eighteen months after its acceptance.

10      All Contracting States shall be bound by the amendment, unless they denounce this Convention 
in accordance with article 49, paragraphs 1 and 2, at least six months before the amendment enters into 
force. Such denunciation shall take effect when the amendment enters into force.

11      When an amendment has been adopted but the eighteen month period for its acceptance has not 
yet expired, a State which becomes a Contracting State during that period shall be bound by the 
amendment if it enters into force. A State which becomes a Contracting State after that period shall be 
bound by an amendment which has been accepted in accordance with paragraph 8. In the cases referred 
to in this paragraph, a State becomes bound by an amendment when that amendment enters into force, 
or when this Convention enters into force for that State, if later.

                                                         Denunciation

                                                         Article 49

1        This Convention may be denounced by any State Party at any time after the date on which it 
enters into force for that State Party.

2        Denunciation shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument of denunciation with the 
Secretary-General.

3        Denunciation shall take effect twelve months, or such longer period as may be specified in the 
instrument of denunciation, after its deposit with the Secretary-General.

4        Notwithstanding a denunciation by a State Party pursuant to this article, any provisions of this 
Convention relating to obligations to make contributions under articles 18, 19 or article 21, paragraph 5 
in respect of such payments of compensation as the Assembly may decide relating to an incident which 
occurs before the denunciation takes effect shall continue to apply.

                                                      Extraordinary sessions of the Assembly

                                                         Article 50

1        Any State Party may, within ninety days after the deposit of an instrument of denunciation the 
result of which it considers will significantly increase the level of contributions from the remaining States

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                                  - 32 -

Parties, request the Director to convene an extraordinary session of the Assembly. The Director shall 
convene the Assembly to meet not less than sixty days after receipt of the request.

2    The Director may take the initiative to convene an extraordinary session of the Assembly to meet 
within sixty days after the deposit of any instrument of denunciation, if the Director considers that such 
denunciation will result in a significant increase in the level of contributions from the remaining States 
Parties.

3    If the Assembly, at an extraordinary session, convened in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 
decides that the denunciation will result in a significant increase in the level of contributions from 
the remaining States Parties, any such State may, not later than one hundred and twenty days before the 
date on which the denunciation takes effect, denounce this Convention with effect from the same date.

                                                     Cessation

                                                  Article 51

1    This Convention shall cease to be in force:

     (a)    on the date when the number of States Parties falls below 6; or

     (b)    twelve months after the date on which data concerning a previous calendar year were to 
          be communicated to the Director in accordance with article 21, if the data shows that the 
          total quantity of contributing cargo to the general account in accordance with article 18, 
          paragraphs 1(a) and (c) received in the States Parties in that preceding calendar year was 
          less than 30 million tonnes.

Notwithstanding (b), if the total quantity of contributing cargo to the general account in accordance with 
article 18, paragraphs 1(a) and (c) received in the States Parties in the preceding calendar year was less 
than 30 million tonnes but more than 25 million tonnes the Assembly may, if it considers that this was 
due to exceptional circumstances and is not likely to be repeated, decide before the expiry of the 
above-mentioned twelve month period that the Convention shall continue to be in force. The Assembly 
may not, however, take such a decision in more than two subsequent years.

2    States which are bound by this Convention on the day before the date it ceases to be in force shall 
enable the Fund to exercise its functions as described under article 52 and shall, for that purpose only, 
remain bound by this Convention.

                                                  Article 52

1    If this Convention ceases to be in force, the HNS Fund shall nevertheless:

     (a)    meet its obligations in respect of any incident occurring before this Convention ceased 
          to be in force; and

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
- 33 -                                 LEG/CONF.10/DC.4

(b)     be entitled to exercise its rights to contributions to the extent that these contributions are 
        necessary to meet the obligations under (a), including expenses for the administration of 
        the HNS Fund necessary for this purpose.

2       The Assembly shall take all appropriate measures to complete the winding up of the HNS Fund 
        including the distribution in an equitable manner of any remaining assets among those persons who have 
        contributed to the HNS Fund.

3       For the purposes of this article the HNS Fund shall remain a legal person.

ANNEX II

REGULATIONS FOR THE CALCULATION OF ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
TO THE GENERAL ACCOUNT

Regulation 1

1	The fixed sum referred to in article 17, paragraph 3 shall be determined for each sector in accordance with these regulations.

2	When it is necessary to calculate contributions for more than one sector of the general account, a separate fixed sum per unit of contributing cargo shall be calculated for each of the following sectors as may be required:

	(a)	solid bulk materials referred to in article 1, paragraph 5(a)(vii);

	(b)	oil, if the operation of the oil account is postponed or suspended;

	(c)	LNG, if the operation of the LNG account is postponed or suspended;

	(d)	LPG, if the operation of the LPG account is postponed or suspended;

	(e)	other substances.

Regulation 2

1	For each sector, the fixed sum per unit of contributing cargo shall be the product of the levy per HNS point and the sector factor for that sector.

2	The levy per HNS point shall be the total annual contributions to be levied to the general account divided by the total HNS points for all sectors.

3	The total HNS points for each sector shall be the product of the total volume, measured in metric tonnes, of contributing cargo for that sector and the corresponding sector factor.

4	A sector factor shall be calculated as the weighted arithmetic average of the claims/volume ratio for that sector for the relevant year and the previous nine years, according to this regulation.

5	Except as provided in paragraph 6, the claims/volume ratio for each of these years shall be calculated as follows:

	(a)	established claims, measured in units of account converted from the claim currency using the rate applicable on the date of the incident in question, for damage caused by substances in respect of which contributions to the HNS Fund are due for the relevant year; divided by

	(b)	the volume of contributing cargo corresponding to the relevant year.

I:\CONF\LEG\10\DC.4
LEG/CONF.10/DC.4                  - 38 -

6      In cases where the information required in paragraphs 5(a) and (b) is not available the following 
       values shall be used for the claims/volume ratio for each of the missing years:

       (a)    solid bulk materials referred to in article 1, paragraph 5 (a)(vii)                  0
       (b)    oil, if the operation of the oil account is postponed                                  0
       (c)    LNG, if the operation of the LNG account is postponed                                0
       (d)    LPG, if the operation of the LPG account is postponed                                0
       (e)    other substances                                                                      0.0001

7      The arithmetic average of the ten years shall be weighted on a decreasing linear scale, so that the 
       ratio of the relevant year shall have a weight of 10, the year prior to the relevant year shall have a weight 
       of 9, the next preceding year shall have a weight of 8, and so on, until the tenth year has a weight of 1.

8      If the operation of a separate account has been suspended, the relevant sector factor shall be 
       calculated in accordance with those provisions of this regulation which the Assembly shall consider 
       appropriate.
