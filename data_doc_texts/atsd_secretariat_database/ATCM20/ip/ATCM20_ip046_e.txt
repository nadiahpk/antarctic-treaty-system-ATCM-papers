Agenda item 11

The joint SCAR-COMNAP request for proposals to host the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) and develop the Antarctic Data Directory System (ADDS) led to the proposal from the International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research (ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand being accepted by the SCAR and COMNAP Executive Committees. The whole project is being operated under the auspices of SCAR and COMNAP and a Memorandum of Understanding between SCAR, COMNAP and ICAIR was signed by representatives of all three parties in July 1995. The Memorandum sets out the agreed services and conditions of those services that will be provided by ICAIR for SCAR and COMNAP.

The project is being funded by a consortium of four countries working in the Ross Sea Sector: New Zealand, United States, Italy and France. A Steering Committee has been established with representatives from the four funding partners, SCAR and COMNAP, and the Committee held its first meeting at ICAIR in December 1995.

The first meeting of the Steering Committee reviewed progress to date. Seven countries (New Zealand, Italy, France China, Japan, Australia and Germany) had already identified their National Antarctic Data Centres (NADCs) but all SCAR-COMNAP countries need to do so to provide the essential links to ICAIR and the ADDS. Further participation in the system could be achieved by encouraging other countries to join as funding partners and by arranging for promotion and training exchanges of personnel between ICAIR and NADCs.

The Committee recognized the importance of maintaining the momentum of the ADDS and discussed the development of a suite of promotional materials, such as a diskette and a newsletter, for distribution through the SCAR and COMNAP communities. Information releases would not only report progress but could also demonstrate the advantages for research and management of using the AMD and the ADDS.

The major task for the ADDS currently being undertaken is the development of a Directory Interchange Format (DIF) Toolkit. An ICAIR staff member has been working at Institut Français pour la Recherche et la Technologie Polaires (IFRTP) in Brest, France, to develop a DIF Toolkit for use by French Antarctic scientists that will then be used as the basis for a generic toolkit for use by all NADCs.

The next meeting of the Steering Committee is scheduled to be held during the XXIV SCAR Meeting in Cambridge, United Kingdom, during August 1996.  It is proposed that a demonstration of the AMD and the ADDS will be given to the SCAR and COMNAP Executives, together with their Chief Officers, and that copies of the AMD Toolkit will be available for distribution to representatives of NADCs.

In addition, the joint SCAR-COMNAP ad hoc Planning Group on Antarctic Data Management will be meeting during XXIV SCAR to produce a proposal on the organisational and technical structures which will be required by SCAR and COMNAP over the next 4-6 years. These will be to ensure the support of the ADDS/AMD and also to take advantage of the rapid advances in Internet technology, especially the growth of the World Wide Web, that can be used to continue improvement in the access and comparability of Antarctic scientific data.
