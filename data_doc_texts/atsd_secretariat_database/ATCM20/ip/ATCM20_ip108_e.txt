OPENING ADDRESS BY MR STUART PRIOR

HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF NEW ZEALAND

Mr Chairman

Congratulations on your election to Chair this twentieth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Through you, Mr Chairman, may I thank the Government of the Netherlands for this opportunity to meet in Utrecht.

Mr Chairman, nearly all Consultative Parties have ratified the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. There is now a very real possibility that it will enter into force in 1997. This will be an historic occasion. It will demonstrate Parties' commitment to the implementation of a remarkable environmental regime. Entry into force, however, is not the end and Parties will need to work hard to maintain the momentum of the Protocol and the ATS, as well as the further development of the Antarctic Treaty system itself.

Entry in force also means the establishment of the Committee for Environmental Protection. A key task for Parties at this meeting will be to consider and define the functions and responsibilities of the CEP in advance of its possible first meeting next year. At the same time, much remains to be done in developing the practical processes needed to give force to the Protocol and to ensure that it becomes a practical and dynamic instrument for the protection of Antarctica.

New Zealand has an explicit commitment to this process. Over the past year since we last met, New Zealand has worked steadily to implement the Protocol in our domestic Antarctic practices. This work has included the establishment of an Environmental Assessment and Review Panel which is responsible for reviewing all proposed New Zealand Antarctic activities to determine if the level of impact is acceptable. Following on from our practice in 1995, Environmental Impact Assessments have been prepared by New Zealand Antarctic tour operators. In addition to this, the New Zealand Antarctic Programme prepared an EIA as its first step in a plan to relocate its fuel tank storage area at Scott Base. During the preceding 12 months New Zealand, in association with the United States, has been working on a feasibility study to develop a joint response oil spill contingency plan for the Ross Sea. Copies of all these papers are available as Information Papers to interested delegates.
A subject of particular interest to New Zealand, as we noted last year, is the growth and 
development of tourism and non-governmental activity in the Antarctic Treaty area. 
During the 1995-96 Antarctic season, the Ross Sea hosted 806 visitors aboard four 
different ships which made a total of six cruises. Any substantial increase in activity, 
particularly the use of helicopters to access previously undisturbed areas of the 
continent, has the potential for detrimental impact on the natural landscapes and 
wildlife, and for the disruption of other legitimate activities in the region, particularly 
scientific research. Tourism, therefore like other activities in Antarctica, is subject to 
review and agreed controls and we welcomed the development of Recommendation 
XVIII-1 and the subsequent resolution on post-visit reports.

To assist with the planned management of tourism and other non-governmental 
activities in the Ross Sea, New Zealand has produced a draft management plan for tour 
operators and visitors alike. The plan sets out a New Zealand framework for 
New Zealand-based visits to the Ross Sea region. In the plan we have established a 
strategy to provide information and guidance for the running of efficient tour operations 
in the Ross Sea which embody the spirit and principles underlying the Protocol. New 
Zealand has also produced a model EIA for tour operators who might operate in the 
Ross Sea and who would appreciate assistance in the preparation of EIA documents. 
We are also continuing our intersessional work on developing a standardised reporting 
format for visitors to Antarctica. We hope that this form will be ready for consideration 
by Parties at the next ATCM.

Also of particular concern to New Zealand is the completion of the annex on Liability. 
This is the last outstanding component of the Protocol and with the imminent entry into 
force of the Protocol, the need to make substantive progress on this issue is becoming 
more urgent. We hope that here at Utrecht, we will be able to engage in a substantive 
debate and achieve significant progress.

We hope too, that Parties will be able to make constructive progress on organisational 
matters. It is important that the ATS maintain its momentum and credibility 
internationally. Our focus should be firmly fixed on developing and elaborating the 
farsighted, ambitious and complex programme for the protection and management of 
the Antarctic continent envisaged in the Environmental Protocol.

In this context, we believe that it is important for the ATS to develop and maintain its 
contact with other international fora. We believe that closer links with the UN system 
and with the UNEP in particular would assist Parties with the development of a 
Protocol-based environmental management regime for Antarctica. The "Question of 
Antarctica" in the United Nations will come up again this year. New Zealand is 
working on a bilateral basis with Malaysia and other countries in the Asia/Pacific region 
to encourage greater involvement and awareness of the Protocol and the Antarctic 
Treaty. We are also actively seeking areas of scientific collaboration in Antarctica with 
our neighbours and friends in this region.
Mr Chairman,

Mutual cooperation, assistance and consensus have marked the Treaty since its 
inception and we hope that Parties' continuing commitment to these principles will 
produce a conducive working environment and one that will provide for substantive 
debate and progress on the issues before us.
