I DISCOVER THAT ANTARTICA IS
A CONTINENT DEVOTED TO THE
PROTECTION OF LIFE

INVITATION :     WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD"ANTARCTICA" THEY THINK OF
THE CONTINENT OF ICE LOCATED ON THE SOUTHERN TIP OF
THE WORLD, WHAT EVERYONE DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT ANTARC-
TICA STANDS AS THE ONLY CONTINENT WHERE LIFE IS WELL
PROTECTED, AS I AM WILLING TO GIVE MY THANKS FOR
THIS EXCELENT PIECE OF NEWS, I PERFORM NEXT ACTIVI-
TIES AS DESCRIBED.

VERY IMPORTANT:I DO ANYTHING CAREFULLY AND CLEANLY, WHENEVER I HAVE
TO READ, LISTEN, TALK, WRITE, DRAW, PUT TOGETHER AN
OBJECT, RESEARCH, PERFORM A PART IN A PLAY, ETC. I
WILL NEVER DO IT CARELESSLY, I REALLY WANT TO LEARN,
THAT IS WHY THE PLAY SHOULD BE WELL PERFORMED.
1. WITH MY WORK-GROUP I READ ALOUD THE PLAY CALLED "ANTARCTICA"


ANTARCTICA *

CHARACTERS: ANA, HECTOR, DIEGO, JULIA AND MONICA

ANA :      I JUST READ THAT ANTARCTICA IS THE COLDEST CONTINENT 
           ON EARTH. 89 DEGREES UNDER ZERO HAVE BEEN RECORDED 
           THERE.

HECTOR :   UNDER ZERO ? IS THERE ANY KIND OF LIFE WITH SUCH A 
           COLD TEMPERATURE ?

ANA :      A LOT, SPECIALLY IN THE SEA. THERE ARE ANIMALS SO 
           SMALL AS KRILL, A KIND OF SHRIMP OF ABOUT FIVE CENTI-
           METERS LONG AND SO BIG AS THE BLUE WHALE, OF 32 ME-
           TERS LONG AND 150 TONS OF WEIGHT,PERHAPS THE BIGGEST 
           ANIMAL ON THE PLANET.

DIEGO;     WHAT DOES 150 TONS MEAN ?

JULIA:     EVERY TON IS EQUAL TO ONE THOUSAND KILOGRAMS.

DIEGO;     THEN, A BLUE WHALE WEIGHES 150,000 KILOGRAMS.

JULIA :    IF WE GATHER SEVERAL PERSONS WEIGHING 75 KILOGRAMS E-
           VERY ONE, TWO THOUSANDS OF THEM WOULD BE EQUIVALENT 
           TO ONE BLUE WHALE.

MONICA:    AND, ON THE CONTINENT, ARE THERE PLANTS, TREES?

ANA:       NO, THERE ARE NO PLANTS NOR TREES, ONLY LICHENS, AN 
           ASSOCIATION OF FUNGI AND ALGAE, SOME OF THEM GROW ON 
           THE ROCKS LIKE CRUSTS, ON OTHER PLACES THERE ARE MOSSES 
           AND NEXT TO THEM CERTAIN PLANTS WITH FLOWERS.

MONICA:    ON THE GROUND ITSELF, CAN'T ANYTHING BE PLANTED?

* Based on a text written by Mr. Oscar Pinochet de la Barra,
Director of Instituto Antartico Chileno.

2
ANA :     EARTH AS SOIL IS VERY SCARCE, EVERYTHING AROUND IS ICE 
          AND ROCKS, THE SOIL ITSELF DOESN'T CONTAIN THE NECESSA-
          RY ELEMENTS TO GROW PLANTS.

HECTOR :  AND, ON THE LAND, ARE THERE  ANIMALS ?

ANA :     EXCEPT SOME SMALL INSECTS LIVING AMONG LICHENS, ON THE 
          ANTARCTIC LAND NO BIG ANIMALS, SUCH AS DOGS, AND HORSES 
          CAN BE SEEN, THOSE EXISTING LIVE ON LAND AND IN THE SEA, 
          THEY ARE FUR SEALS, ELEPHANT SEALS AND OTHER SEAL SPECIES,

DIEGO :   ARE THERE BIRDS?

A  :      YES, PENGUINS CAN BE SEEN IN GREAT NUMBER, THEY LOOK LIKE 
          GLAD CHILDREN AND MAKE ANY PLACE CHEERFUL, YOU CAN ALSO 
          FIND SEA-GULLS, CORMORANS, ALBATROSSES AND SKUAS, A PRE-
          DATOR BIRD THAT IS AN ENEMY OF PENGUINS BECAUSE IT EATS 
          THEIR EGGS AND CHICKENS.

MONICA:   THERE MUST BE TERRIBLE TO LIVE THERE...NO EARTH...NO 
          PLANTS NOR GRASS...

ANA :     THERE ARE STILL OTHER FACTS WHICH MAKE MAN'S LIFE HARD IN 
          THAT CONTINENT, SEASONS ARE NOT DIFFERENT, INDEED, THERE 
          ARE TWO PERIODS, ONE OF THEM IS ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS, DAYS 
          ARE SHORT AND THE SEA IS FROZEN,

DIEGO :   YOU ARE SAYING THAT DAYS ARE SHORT,.. WHAT TIME DOES THE 
          SUN SET ?

ANA :     THE SUN SETS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON,

HECTOR:   WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PERIOD? IT MUST BE MORE ENDURABLE,

ANA :     OH, YES, IT IS ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AND DAYS ARE LONGER, EVEN, 
          IN SOME OF ITS NIGHTS, DARKNESS IS NOT COMPLETE, AS FOR 
          THE SEA, THE ICE IS MELTED AND SHIPS CAN SAIL,

DIEGO :   IS IT TRUE THAT IN ONE DAY WHEATHER MAY CHANGE GREATLY?

ANA :     SURE, IN A DAY, YOU CAN LIVE UNDER A STRONG WIND AND 
          THEN A COMPLETE-SILENCE AND QUIETNESS,
          3
MONICA:     ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO LIKE LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE?

DIEGO :     I SAW IN THE TV A SCIENTIST WHO LOVED THAT CONTINENT AND 
            NATURE, THAT MIXTURE OF PEACE AND STRENGTH, CARACTERISTIC 
            OF ANTARCTICA,WAS PRESENT IN HIM THROUGH THE INTERVIEW,

JULIA :     JUST THE SAME IMPRESSION I HAD WHEN I MET A TEACHER WHO WAS 
            RETURNING FROM ANTARTICA .MY COMPANIONS AND ME WERE DEFEN-
            DING THE CARE OF WHALES. THE TEACHER SAID: I AM COMING FROM 
            A PLACE WHERE WHALES LIVE FREELY, THEN, I ASKED: FROM A ZOO? 
            NO, HE ANSWERED, FROM ANTARCTICA, THE CONTINENT WHERE MAN 
            TAKES CARE OF ANIMALS.

MONICA:     I AM BEGINNING TO LIKE THAT DIFFICULT CONTINENT. ALL THOSE 
            WHO TAKE CARE OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS MAY COUNT ON ME. IT IS 
            GOOD TO KNOW THAT IN SUCH.A PLACE ON EARTH LIFE, ANY KIND OF 
            LIFE, IS FULLY RESPECTED.

JULIA :     THE TEACHER SAID SOMETHING MORE: 'THIS CONTINENT IS RULED 
            BY SEVERAL JOINT COUNTRIES, WAR IS FORBIDDEN THERE. PEACE 
            AND SCIENCE .ARE THE MAIN PREOCCUPATION FOR EVERYBODY,'

DIEGO:      ARE THERE MANY SCIENTISTS GOING TO THAT CONTINENT?

JULIA:      IN 1995 THERE WERE 48  SCIENTIFIC STATIONS BELONGING TO 
            26 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, THERE, PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT NATIO-
            NALITY OF PERSONS. WHAT REALLY IS OF INTEREST, IS THEIR 
            DEDICATION TO SCIENCE AND THEIR JOINING TO PEACE AMONG THE 
            NATIONS OF THE WORLD.

HECTOR:     SO, ANTARCTICA IS A DIFFICULT CONTINENT TO LIVE  BECAUSE 
            THE SOIL IS SCARCE AND NO USEFUL TO GROW PLANTS AND TREES, 
            BESIDES, THE COLD WEATHER IS HARD AND PERMANENT, AND, AS 
            THERE ARE NO INDUSTRIES NOR AGRICULTURE EVERY OBJECT AND PRO-
            DUCT YOU NEED MUST BE CARRIED FROM OUTSIDE REGIONS,

DIEGO:      HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT, I THINK IT MUST BE PLEASANT TO 
            LIVE WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE PEACE, SCIENCE AND NATURE.

JULIA:      I THINK THAT IT IS A CONTINENT WHOSE PEOPLE IS LIVING NOW 
            WHAT THE REST OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ARE LONGING FOR 
            THE FUTURE. IT MEANS THAT IN ANTARCTICA, THE YOUTH OF NATIONS 
            IS INVITED TO JOIN THE STUDIOUS AND JOINT SOCIETY THEIR PARENTS 
            WILL LEAVE IN HERITANCE.

4
DIEGO:     I THINK THAT THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT IS A UNIQUE PLACE IN 
THE WORLD. IT IS THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT SOIL TO GROW PLANTS 
AND TREES. ALMOST EVERYTHING IS ICE, ROCKS AND SEA, ONLY 
THE AIR IS UNCONTAMINATED THERE.

ANA :     IT IS ALSO A UNIQUE PLACE BECAUSE ITS INHABITANTS CAN REALLY 
LIVE IN PEACE. PEOPLE THERE DON'T DISCRIMINATE ANYBODY, 
MOREOVER, THEY TAKE CARE OF ANIMAL LIFE, THUS,IT'S NOT ONLY 
A UNIQUE LANDSCAPE BUT ALSO A UNIQUE SOCIETY.

JULIA:     IT IS, AT THE SAME TIME, A NATURAL RESERVATION AND A RESERVA-
TION OF FRIENDSHIP.

HECTOR:   PLEASE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH "NATURAL RESERVATION"?

JULIA :    THOUGH ON THE LAND, ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE IS SCAPCE, IN 
THE SEA IS VERY ABUNDANT, THE ICE ON THE CONTINENT REPRESENTS 
THE SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE DRINKING WATER OF THE PLANET.

HECTOR:   HOW MUCH IS THAT?

ANA :      IMAGINE ALL THE WATER FOR DRINKING, WASHING AND WATERING GAR-
DENS IS KEPT IN TO ONE HUNDRED BARRELS, WELL, SEVENTY OF THEM 
WOULD BE IN ANTARCTICA,

JULIA:     SO, IF A DAY COMES THAT MANKIND IS NEEDING MORE FOOD AND WATER, 
I MEAN UNCONTAMINATED WATER, ANTARCTICA HAS AT OUR DISPOSAL 
A NATURAL RESERVATION TO DRAW ON,

MONICA:    THAT IS VERY GOOD .., AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH "A RESERVA-
TION OF FRIENDSHIP"?

JULIA:     IF, IN THE FUTURE, HUMAN BEINGS STOP SETTLING VALUE TO PERSONS 
AND TO NATURE, THEY MAY APPEAL TO INHABITANTS OF THAT CONTINENT, 
WHO, LIVING IN BROTHERHOOD FOR YEARS MAY BE OF GREAT HELP TO 
RECOVER FRIENDSHIP AND RESPECT FOR LIFE.

MONICA : ACCORDING TO ALL OF YOU HAVE EXPLAINED, I WOULD DO THE 
FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO PERSONS WILLING TO GO WORKING TO 
ANTARCTICA:
1.WHAT SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY WILL YOU PERFORM ?
2. ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF NATURE, TO PREVENT EVERY KIND OF CONTAMINATION, TO 
TAKE CARE OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS, TERRESTRIAL 
AND MARINE`ONES?
3. WILL YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF UNDERSTANDING AND 
PEACE AMONG PEOPLE AND THEIR NATIONS?

DIEGO`: I WOULD ADD THE FOLLOWING QUESTION :
DO YOU FEEL LIKE ACCEPTING AND LOVING.A WILD 
NATURE?,... A NATURE ABLE TO GO FROM .THE HAPD-
EST STORM TO CALMNESS ANDSERENITY  JUST IN 
A FEW HOURS?

ANA :   WHILE YOU WERE ASKING YOUR QUESTIONS, I WAS THINKING: WHAT 
WOULD HAPPEN TO AN ART`S LOVER IN THAT CONTI-
NENT?  WHAT KIND OF MUSIC WOULD RESULT FROM 
THAT SO GREAT FORCE OF NATURE AND ITS COMPLETE 
SILENCE?  WHAT SHAPES, WHAT KIND OF LIGHT, 
WHAT COLORS WOULD RESULT FROM THOSE SKY, SEA 
AND ICE MASSES?

HECTOR: AND WHAT WORDS WOULD BE WRITTEN BY A POET IN ANTARCTICA?

JULIA:  I DON'T KNOW. AS FOR MYSELF, I WOULD BE SILENT FOR A LONG 
TIME BEFORE SPEAKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT ENIGMATIC INMEN-
SITY.

2. I HELP TO PREPARE THE PLAY

ALONG WITH ALL THE CLASS,I TAKE PART IN`:
1. NAMING ACTORS FOR READING THE PLAY IN FRONT OF THE CLASS,
2. NAMING PERSONS FOR DIRECTING AND PRODUCING THE PLAY.

THE CHOSEN PERSONS MUST HAVE THE NECESSARY TIME TO PREPARE A GOOD 
READING OR PLAYING AND DISPOSE OF ANY OBJECT NEEDED,
                                                                                                                        6
3. I TAKE PART IN THE PLAY ABOUT ANTARCTICA

IN THE LESSON OF THE PLAY, I PLAY THE ROL GIVEN BY THE CLASS: AC-
TOR, DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, IN CHARGE OF SOME SPECIFIC TASKS, OR
PART OF THE PUBLIC, IF I TAKE THE LATEST ROLE, I MUST BE AWARE OF THAT
A GOOD PLAYING DEPENDS UPON THE PUBLIC,TOO,

4.  I PREPARE MYSELF TO SHARE WHAT BE LEARNT

4.1. I DESCRIBE WITH WORDS, DRAWINGS OR PRESS CUTTINGS, THREE
OF THE FOLLOWING ANTARCTIC SITUATIONS:

A) AN ANTARCTIC LANDSCAPE SHOWING A ROCK WITH THE CHARAC-
TERISTIC VEGETATION ON IT, TERRESTRIAL OR MARINE ANI-
MALS, AND A BIRD,

B) A WHALE ESCAPING FROM HUNTERS AND ARRIVING TO ANTARC-
TICA,

C) A SCIENTIST OBSERVING AN ANIMAL WHICH STAYS QUIET IN
FRONT OF HIM,

D) PENGUINS DEFENDING THEIR NESTS FROM SKUAS,

4.2. I EXPLAIN, WITH WORDS OR A DRAWING, WHAT I THINK ABOUT
ONE OF THE TWO FOLLOWING STATEMENTS:

A) ANTARCTICA IS A UNIQUE PLACE IN THE WORLD,

B) ANTARCTICA IS A NATURAL RESERVATION OF OUR PLANET,

C) ANTARCTICA IS A RESERVATION OF FRIENDSHIP,

4.3 I IMAGINE AND DESCRIBE, WITH WORDS OR DRAWINGS,
TWO OF THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:

A) CLOTHES I WOULD WEAR IF I TRAVEL TO ANTARCTICA,

B) TWO OR MORE PERSONS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES,
WORKING IN ANTARCTICA AND HELPING ONE ANOTHER,

C) A PERSON DEFENDING PENGUIN CHICKENS FROM A SKUA'S
ATTACK,
 
7
5. IN MY FAMILY OR COMMUNITY

1. TO A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY OR COMMUNITY:
A) I TELL HIM WHAT I HAVE LEARNT ABOUT ANTARCTICA
B) I INVITE HIM TO IMAGINE A FAMILIAR TRAVEL TO ANTARCTICA
AND I ASK HIM TO ANSWER:
    WHAT KIND OF CLOTHES WE WOULD TAKE ?
    WHAT KIND OF FOOD WE SHOULD GET?

I TAKE NOTE  OF HIS ANSWER  TO SHARE IT WITH MI SCHOOL GROUP,

6. SHARING WHAT I HAVE LEARNT

WE SHARE THE TASKS PERFORMED BY EACH, EVERY ONE WRITES DOWN
IN HIS NOTEBOOK WHAT HE HAS LEARNT IN THE GROUP TASK,

7 WITH THE COMPLETE CLASS

WE PREPARE AN EXHIBITION ABOUT LIFE IN ANTARCTICA, IT CONSISTS
IN THE TASKS DONE WHEN PERFORMING THE PRESENT CHART, DRAWINGS
OR WRITTEN SHEETS, OR OTHER TYPE OF COMMUNICATION SHOWING THE
PROTECTION OF ANTARCTIC LIFE.
BESIDES, YOU MAY ADD :
A) DRAWINGS OR PHOTOS OF PERSONS LIVING IN ANTARCTICA
B) DRAWINGS OR PHOTOS OF LANDSCAPES OR ANTARCTIC NATURE
C) DRAWINGS OR PHOTOS OF ANIMALS, BIRDS AND PLANTS OF
   ANTARCTICA,
D) A SCALE MODEL  ABOUT ANTARCTICA MADE OF WOOD, PAPER,
   PAPERBOARD, ETC.

8. I CHECK WHAT I HAVE LEARNT

IN MY NOTEBOOK AND CONSULTING EVERYTHING CONSIDERED CONVENIENT:

8.1 I WRITE DOWN THREE SENTENCES OF THE CHARACTERS OF THE
PLAY IN WHICH, IN MY OPINION, THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT
ANTARCTICA IS A CONTINENT DEVOTED TO PROTECT. LIFE.

8.2 I FULFILL TWO OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:
A) I MAKE A DRAWING OF PERSONS, ANIMALS AND BIRDS LIVING
TOGTHER IN ANTARCTICA.

B) I MAKE A COMMENT, WITH WORDS OR DRAWINGS, ABOUT THE LAST
SENTENCES OF ANA AND JULIA,

C) I WRITE A LETTER TO A SCIENTIST WHO WORKS IN ANTARCTICA
TELLING WHAT I WOULD DO IF I STAYED THERE, IN ORDER
TO HELP HIM TO PROTECT WILD LIFE.

9. EVALUATING WHAT WAS LEARNT WITH THE CLASS

AFTER EVERY PUPIL HAS FINISHED THE BEFORE MENTIONED TASK WE GA-
THER WITH THE TEACHER TO TALK ABOUT:

A) THE MOST IMPORTANT LEARNING GAINED BY US,

B) DIFFICULTIES, IF ANY, WHEN PERFORMING SOME OF THE STEPS
OF THE PRESENT CHART.
