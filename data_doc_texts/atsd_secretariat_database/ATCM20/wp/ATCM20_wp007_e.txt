1. This report covers events regarding the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) from May 1995 to the present. Events prior to May 1995 were reported to the XVIIIth and XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (see Annex B and Annex F of the respective Final Reports).

2. Following the decision at the informal meeting of Contracting Parties in Tasmania in October 1993 that Parties should comply fully with the reporting requirement of Article 5 (Capture and Killing of Seals) of the Convention, the UK as depositary reminded Parties of this obligation by Diplomatic Note on 4 August 1995.  Returns for 1995 covering the period from 1 March 1994 to 30 June 1995 were requested. The results are reproduced as Annex A to this report. Reminders have been sent by Diplomatic Note to those Parties with outstanding responses.

3. As agreed at the above informal meeting the UK as depositary will remind Parties that returns for 1996 (for the period 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996) should be transmitted to the UK and SCAR by 31 October 1996.

4. Since the XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting there have been no accessions to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.  A list of countries which were original signatories of the Convention, and of countries which have subsequently acceded, is attached (Annex B to this Report).
