DATA MANAGEMENT

COLLECTION, ARCHIVING, EXCHANGE AND 
EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

(Agenda Items 11 and 21)

(Submitted by Chile)
DATA MANAGEMENT

COLLECTION, ARCHIVING, EXCHANGE AND 
EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

The agenda of this Consultative Meeting includes a topic that appears as two separate 
items on the agenda: Item 11: “Data Management” and Item 21: “Collection, archiving, 
exchange and evaluation of environmental information”.

Delegates may recall that Item 21 of the Agenda arose from Chile’s proposal, submitted 
at the Kyoto Consultative meeting (1994), about scientific samples which frequently leave the 
Antarctic with destinations unknown.

On that occasion, the Meeting referred to Articles 3 and 6 of the Madrid Protocol, and 
agreed to include this concern in the agenda of the following meeting (Seoul), under the item on 
data requirements for environmental monitoring; however, some felt that the problem of locating 
samples that leave the Antarctic is rather one of data management and archiving.

At the Seoul Consultative meeting (1995) these two subjects were divided into two 
different items of the Agenda; the situation persists at this Consultative Meeting in Utrecht. 
Moreover, both subjects are covered by different bodies: Item 11 will be considered by the 
TEWG while Item 21 will be discussed by Working Group II of the XXth Consultative Meeting.

Having analyzed the discussions held in Seoul on both aspects of the problem, the 
delegation of Chile believes that these items should be covered by one agenda item. They are 
both part of the same question, i.e., the development of a general Antarctic system for managing, 
collecting, disseminating and filing data, whether of a scientific or specific nature.

It is a well-known fact that the proliferation of information systems does not lead to 
effective management, and the Antarctic system is not immune to that inefficiency. We therefore 
believe that the Meeting should devote itself to implementing only one data management system, 
and that this subject be considered either by the TEWG or by Working Group II. It is important 
to avoid duplication of work and functions.

The Chilean delegation believes that it is very difficult to separate scientific data itself 
from the data required to carry out environmental evaluations; consequently, operating with 
different data management systems is neither adequate nor practical. We therefore propose that 
in the future, both subjects be collated and included in one agenda item under the name “data 
management”.

If the Meeting proceeds as Chile recommends, the subject of regulating the removal, 
management, and custody of scientific samples extracted from the Antarctic (the scope of which 
is much greater than the topic of data management) will still be pending. It is therefore advisable 
that the Consultative Meeting consider and approve its inclusion in another agenda item that could 
be called “Effectiveness of Environmental Protection Measures”.
