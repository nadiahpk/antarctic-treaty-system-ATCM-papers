PROTOCOL ON
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY:
"Implementation"

(Agenda Item 6a)

(Submitted by Chile)
PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Implementation

In accordance with the commitment made by all the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in 1991, i.e., that the provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty be ratified in the short term and implemented provisionally and voluntarily while it becomes effective, the Government of Chile met its commitment on January 11, 1995, when it ratified and deposited the ratification instrument before the government of the United States.

In addition, Chile's national Antarctic authorities have devoted their efforts to complying with the Protocol and its annexes, and have therefore taken the following actions:

a.	Ensuring that the Madrid Protocol provisions are consistent with the Basic Environmental Law (Law No. 19.300), Chile's main environmental framework. Meetings were held between domestic Antarctic operators and the National Environmental Commission (CONAMA). Under the above-mentioned law, one of the functions of this Agency is to evaluate Environmental Impact Assessments.

During the last Antarctic season, the Antarctic operators and CONAMA made a preliminary internal audit of the main Chilean facilities located in the Antarctic continent. This activity was carried out in February 1996. Two CONAMA officials participated in the audit; they visited the Presidente Frei and Julio Escudero stations on King George Island, the Arturo Prat station on Greenwich Island, the Bernardo O'Higgins station on the Antarctic Peninsula, and Pisopatrón station on Robert Island.

This internal audit is part of a joint effort carried out by the Antarctic operators and CONAMA aimed at assessing the present environmental status of Chile's facilities in the Antarctic; Chile hopes to complement this activity with new on-site visits in the future.

b.	Under Article 8 of the Protocol and Annex I, an EIA was made of the Julio Escudero station, which operates under the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH).

c.	Under the provisions of Annex II, INACH granted the required permits for entry into protected areas and the capture of protected species.

d.	In compliance with Annex III, the four domestic Antarctic operators (INACH, the Chilean Navy, Air Force and Army) began removing trash and waste from the Antarctic in the 1993/94 season; this activity continued until the 1995/96 season.

e.	In accordance with Annex IV, throughout the 1995/96 season the Chilean Navy, together with the Antarctic patrol, among other activities, continued carrying out work aimed at preventing marine pollution.

f.     For the first time ever, INACH received an official budget to implement specific 
       investment projects aimed at protecting the Antarctic environment.

In conclusion, we wish to reiterate that domestic Antarctic operators, as much as possible 
and on a voluntary basis, will continue implementing the Madrid Protocol provisions as a way 
to underline Chile’s commitment to the protection of the Antarctic environment.
