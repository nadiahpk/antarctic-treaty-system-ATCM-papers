EXTENSION OF EXPIRY DATE FOR MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SITE
OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST NO. 25 (MARINE PLAIN)

(Agenda item 20a)

(Submitted by Australia)
EXTENSION OF EXPIRY DATE FOR MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SITE 
OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST NO 25 (MARINE PLAIN)

The management plan for Site of Special Scientific Interest No 25, Marine Plain, 
Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, specifies that the designation is due to 
expire on 31 December 1997.

The management plan for the site has not yet been revised in the Annex 
V format.

If the management plan is allowed to expire in December 1997, there 
will be no protection for this sensitive and scientifically valuable site.

The Australian delegation proposes that the expiry date for the manage-
ment plan be extended to 31 December 2000 so that the current manage-
ment plan remains in force until the management plan has been revised.

The expiry date of twelve SSSIs were extended at ATCM XIX to 31 
December 2000 [Resolution 7 (1995)].
