Antarctic Inspection Checklists

These checklists, which are not intended to be exhaustive, are designed to 
provide a guideline to observers conducting inspections in Antarctica in accordance 
with the provisions of Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty.

Not all items in the checklists are necessarily applicable to the activity being 
inspected or directly related to Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty or the 
requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
It is recognized that some of the items could be addressed through the Antarctic 
Treaty Exchange of Information. It is also recognized that the purpose of an 
inspection is to verify through observation. Therefore, any inspection report should 
clearly identify which information was observed and which was taken from 
documents .

It is recommended that observers seek out and examine all relevant documents 
prior to undertaking inspections, including the Antarctic Treaty Exchange of 
Information, the relevant national Annual Reports to SCAR  and the 
COMNAP/SCALOP Advance Exchange of Information.
