INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION (IEE)
RECONSTRUCTION OF A BUILDING TO BE USED FOR HOUSING

INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION (IEE)
RECONSTRUCTION OF A BUILDING TO BE USED FOR HOUSING

1.    Purposes, Need and Geographic Location

In this activity, a metallic building will be assembled, to be used as housing for scientific personnel and guests passing through the Artigas Scientific Antarctic Station located on King George Island, South Shetland (62°11'4" S; 58°57'7"W).

The metallic building will be converted into a building that will replace the existing ones, to be used for different purposes since they have already completed their useful life cycle which began in early 1985. The design aims at being a housing facility for 40 people and will also include bathrooms, a laundry room, an infirmary, a reading room, a recreation room as well as an exercise room. The size of the building will be as follows: 22 m x 12 m x 5 m, and the type of construction, just as in the previous building, is that of a metallic "prefabricated" structure, in which the proven practicality of a structure made of a rigid frame is combined with an almost unlimited design flexibility which meets specific needs. This is extremely valuable for minimizing leftover materials, waste and cuttings characteristic of this type of construction.

2.    Duration and Sequence of Activities

Civil works associated with the assembly of the building: the existing slab will be used (same dimensions as mentioned above, thickness of 0.15 m; the old building's slab will be extended by 3 m on each side in order to cover the entire main floor space area. In addition, in order to secure the structure to the floor, 8 cement cubes of approximately 1 m^(3) will be driven in. We should emphasize that because of the building's characteristics, were it to become obsolete it could be easily removed from the area or transferred to another area, since all of its elements can be disassembled; the pipes and other buried structures can be removed, thus returning the area to its original condition and hence integrating it with the rest of the landscape.

3.    Scope of Activities

Regarding the nature of the impact associated with this type of activity, just as in the previous construction, there are no seabird populations nor any sea mammals that might be affected; because of continuous ice movements, there is practically no native flora. Consequently, the relatively minor earth moving activities will not have a negative impact on the biota, particularly since only a 24 m x 14 m area will be levelled in the area adjacent to the old construction. We wish to underline that the soil in that area is of a granular type, made up by pebbles on the surface and by a more cohesive binding composite of coarse and fine materials underneath.

The building housing the scientific personnel and temporary guests will include a sewage system whereby the waste-water will flow into septic chambers. After the maceration process (produced by keeping the water at favourable temperatures), the sludge is put into containers and taken out of the area while the waste-water is carried through pipes installed on the surface so that there is no interaction with the environment. Drinking water will be supplied by a nearby pond; the amounts to be used are only a small percentage of the pond's total volume of water. The non-degradable, non-organic waste will be removed from the Treaty area each field season:

the organic material will be burnt in accordance with the relevant provisions, and the rest of the 
fuels and oils will be repackaged and removed from the area.

In brief, the new housing construction will replace, in exactly the same site, the building 
that had been used as a machine room; in addition, it will use the existing slab. Earth levelling 
activities will be kept to a minimum. The old building will be disassembled in December 1995 
and, some time towards the end of February 1996, it will be removed from the island by a 
logistic operations ship.

The chart included in this paper shows the various stages of the activities: 
preconstruction, operational construction of the metallic building, and a determination of the 
scope, intensity and duration of the activities, detailing the required and applicable mitigation 
measures.

Even though it is difficult to predict the cumulative impact of this activity, it will be 
minor because of the nature, scope and intensity of the project. In addition, the construction 
project favourably replaces existing activities in the Artigas Scientific Antarctic Station.

4. Intensity of the Activity

See chart. Access into the area is by means of the rescue ship “VANGUARDIA” of the 
Uruguayan Navy, and by HC-130 Hercules aircraft of the Uruguayan Air Force.

5. Identification of the Impact

Since no animal species have been recorded in this area for the last ten years, there will 
be no impact on wildlife, and aesthetic values will be minimally affected.

Permanent monitoring will be carried out through inspections by observers from the 
Uruguayan Antarctic Institute who will check the quantity and type of material being loaded and 
unloaded, as well as the waste material used. Activities will be carried out during daylight hours. 
Contingency plans are not applicable. The person responsible for this project, C/N(CG) Jorge 
Di Lorenzi, is the Director of Logistics of the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute. The activities will 
be carried out according to the provisions of Article 3 of the Madrid Protocol and the applicable 
Uruguayan Legislation on this subject.
