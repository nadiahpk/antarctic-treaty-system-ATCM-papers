OPERATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM

Operation of the Transitional Environmental Working Group (TEWG)

During the XVIIIth ATCM held in Kyoto in 1994, a Transitional Environmental Working Group (TEWG) was established, aimed at preparing more actively the entry into force of the Protocol and the constitution of the Committee for Environmental Protection.

The TEWG began its work at the XIXth ATCM held in Seoul; it proved its effectiveness during the discussion of several subjects, as reflected in the Report it submitted to the plenary (WP 31).

In Venice, the XVIIth ATCM had requested that an informal liaison group, chaired by the Ambassador of Chile, Jorge Berguño, draft provisional Rules of Procedure to be considered by the Committee once it came into being.

The delay in the Protocol's ratification by some of the 26 Consultative members, in addition to the urgent need to see to the protection of the environment, has led us to believe that the TEWG should be supported for a longer period than planned and that its operations be of a more stable nature so that it may be able to fulfil its functions. With that in mind, paragraph 43 of the XIXth ATCM Report (Seoul) states: "The Meeting confirmed that the TEWG is an advisory group constituted by ATCM, pending entry into force of the Protocol, to provide advice and recommendations to the plenary."

Paragraph 44 recalls that "the TEWG should have the basic functions of the CPE....", and adds: "Most delegations also believed that the TEWG should be a standing group". This statement obviously sets it apart from Working Groups I and II of the Consultative Meetings.

In Seoul, several delegations asked the Secretariat support for the TEWG and spoke of the need to establish (paragraph 46): "sub-groups of specialists and meetings or work by correspondence (especially by means of the Internet) or other means between ordinary sessions of the ATCMs".

Intersessional meetings had already been planned for the Committee for Environmental Protection at the XVIIth ATCM, held in Venice in 1992, in accordance with the decision made by the Plenary of that Consultative Meeting (paragraph 35 of the Report): "the Committee's Rules of Procedure should include a specific provision to the effect that it may hold its meetings at a different place than those of a Consultative Meeting, and, if necessary, more frequently".

This idea took shape in provisional rule 6 drafted by the above-mentioned informal liaison group, and it states: "a Committee may meet between two annual sessions to fulfil its functions as agreed by the ATCM".

Chile believes that now that the TEWG is beginning its second session and so that it may continue dealing responsibly with the subject of environmental protection, it should enhance its efforts through the establishment of sub-groups aimed at designing and planning the future

Committee's work; these sub-groups will be able to continue their work once the Committee has 
confirmed their existence, in accordance with the following proposal:

DECISION:

1.      The TEWG shall work on the basis of an Annual Working Program to be 
        implemented through the meeting of small groups, by correspondence (particularly 
        through e-mail or the Internet) or other means during the intersessional period.

2.      To begin with, an Evaluation Sub-group shall be established, to hear the initial 
        and comprehensive evaluations by the Consultative Members as they are sent during the 
        year; it shall submit to the TEWG, before its regular session, a joint and summarized 
        study of these evaluations, in accordance with the provisions of Resolution 6 (1995). This 
        sub-group will be made up of at least ... members appointed by the Consultative Meeting; 
        however, any member wishing to do so can attend the meetings, which will be held at 
        least once during the intersessional period.

        The TEWG's final report shall be included as an Annex to the Consultative 
        Meeting's Final Report.
