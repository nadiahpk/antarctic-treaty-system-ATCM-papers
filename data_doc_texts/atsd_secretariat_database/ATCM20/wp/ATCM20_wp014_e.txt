NOMINATION OF MIKKELSEN CAIRN, VESTFOLD HILLS, AS A HISTORICAL SITE

The Antarctic Treaty Parties have acknowledged since the first Antarctic Treaty Meeting the need to protect Antarctic historic sites and monuments. In 1995, Treaty Parties meeting at Seoul agreed that proposals for historic sites and/or monuments should address one or more of a set of seven guidelines (Resolution 8 (1995).

In accordance with these guidelines, notably

-   a particular event of importance in the history of science or exploration of Antarctica, and

-   symbolic or commemorative value for people of many nations,

Australia and Norway have agreed jointly to propose the inclusion on the 'Treaty Parties' "List of Historic Monuments" of the site of a landing of a Norwegian party on an island of the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, in 1935.

On 20 February 1935, a small party led by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen of the Norwegian whaling ship Thorhavn made a landing on an island, an extension of an ice-free coastal group of hills, about latitude 68°22' 33"S, longitude 18°24' 33"E. Mikkelsen named the hills the Vestfold Hills, after the Norwegian county in which his whaling company was based, and claimed the nearby coast for his country. His wife, Caroline Mikkelsen, accompanied him on the landing to become the first woman to set foot on Antarctica.

The party set up a rock cairn with a wooden mast to mark the spot. In 1957 the cairn was found by Australian expeditioners from the recently established Davis Station, but after two further visits in the early 1960s the location of the site was lost for over 30 years. On 12 November 1995, after the archival and field research, a three-person Australian party rediscovered the cairn on the main island of the Tryne Islands, northeast of Davis. The search also discovered that Caroline Mikkelsen was still living, over 60 years after her historic Antarctic landing, in Tønsberg, Norway. She was notified of the cairn's rediscovery.
