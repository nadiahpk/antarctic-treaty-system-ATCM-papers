ACCESSING INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (IEEs)
VIA THE INTERNET

(Agenda item 18)

(Submitted by the United States of America)
Accessing Initial Environmental Assessments (IEEs) via the Internet

The National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs (OPP) has made a number of IEEs and related documents available on the web. The earliest document is from June 1988. The most recent is dated March 1994. IEEs prepared after March 1994 are not yet available on the web. OPP is in the process of converting all our documents from the STIS system (which cannot display graphics) to one which will be able to display all the information contained in the IEE.

To access the IEEs that are available on the web, enter the NSF Home page (www.nsf.gov), go to the item titled Information and Publications (www.nsf.gov:80/nsf/homepage/infopub.htm). From there click on the item called STIS Publication Database (via Gopher) (gopher://stis.nsf.gov/1). From there, click on the item called Office of the Director, then click on Antarctic EAM. There you will find the documents that currently are available on the web.
