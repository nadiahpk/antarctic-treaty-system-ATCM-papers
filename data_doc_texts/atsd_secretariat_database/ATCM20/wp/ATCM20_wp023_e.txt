EDUCATIONAL AND AESTHETIC VALUES OF THE ANTARCTIC

(Agenda Item 14)

(Submitted by Chile)
EDUCATIONAL AND AESTHETIC VALUES OF THE ANTARCTIC

Antarctica is one of the most unique continents on the earth. Because of the grandeur of 
its geographic framework, its pristine environment and its exceptional flora and fauna, it has become an extremely substantial source of artistic inspiration.

The aesthetic values of the Antarctic are especially emphasized in Article III of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty; Article III provides for the 
prevention of anything that might adversely affect areas of aesthetic importance.

Because of its exceptional educational quality and its ability to enrich the spirit, 
knowledge of that beauty should, increasingly, be within the reach of mankind, especially of 
artists and young people.

Countries such as the United States and Chile, among others, have had a very positive 
experience in their policies to disseminate the above-mentioned values.

In order to consider and take a position on the subject, the Government of Chile has asked 
that a new item be included in the Agenda of the XXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting: 
"Educational and Aesthetic Values of the Antarctic" and proposes the following draft resolution:

WHEREAS:

One of the main values of the Antarctic continent is to be open to new and 
original forms of action and thought.

Its unique characteristics make it attractive to young people;

Its natural beauty is an extremely substantial source of inspiration for the spirit, 
literature, painting, sculpture, music and photography, among other artistic expressions.

RESOLVES:

1. To encourage among young people knowledge about the Antarctic spiritual and 
cultural values, especially in schools.

2. To promote trips by writers and artists to the polar continent (with due regard to 
the ability of each Consultative Member to do so), in order to promote their direct contact 
with the aesthetic values of Antarctica.

3. To promote competitions in the different artistic expressions, the leitmotif of 
which would be the Antarctic or one of its characteristic features.
