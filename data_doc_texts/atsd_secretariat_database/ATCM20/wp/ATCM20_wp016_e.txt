THE STATUS OF PROTECTED AREA DESIGNATIONS UNDER ANNEX V
TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL

(Agenda item 20)

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)
THE STATUS OF PROTECTED AREA DESIGNATIONS UNDER
ANNEX V TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOL

Submitted by the United Kingdom

INTRODUCTION

The question of the status of Management Plans for protected
areas designated under Annex V of the Environmental Protocol
was discussed, but not resolved, at ATCM XVIII (Kyoto, 1994) -
see paras 111-112 (attached) of the Final Report.

A number of delegations, and SCAR, believed that clarification
on this matter would be helpful, and particularly before any
Antarctic Specially Managed Areas were designated.

BACKGROUND

Existing protected area designations in Antarctica include
both mandatory and hortatory provisions. Examples of the
former are Specially Protected Areas (SPAs) and Specially
Reserved Areas (SRAs), entry into which is prohibited except
in accordance with a permit. In contrast, Sites of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Areas of Special Tourist Interest
(ASTIs) and Multiple-use Planning Areas (MPAs) are subject to
merely hortatory provisions. The Management Plans for SSSIs
are voluntarily adopted by ATCPs under Recommendation VIII-4,
and subsequent Recommendations.

The intention behind Annex V was to rationalise existing
protected area designations and to distinguish more clearly
between protected sites and managed sites.

1
Two new categories of designation were introduced:  Antarctic
Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) and Antarctic Specially
Managed Areas (ASMAs). Entry into an ASPA is prohibited
except with a permit, whilst entry into an ASMA does not
require a permit and activities within the area are to be
guided by a Code of Conduct set out in the Management Plan.

Existing protected area designations will be replaced by ASPAs
and ASMAs once Annex V is approved and becomes effective in
accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty. ASPAs
will include all SPAs and SSSIs, and probably any SRA
voluntarily adopted by past ATCMs. ASMAs are likely to
include the MPA voluntarily adopted by a past ATCM. Existing
or proposed Historic Sites and Monuments may be designated as
either an ASPA or an ASMA, or simply be listed.

THE LEGAL STATUS OF MANAGEMENT PLANS

A number of Management Plans in the format laid down in
Article 5 of Annex V have already been adopted by the ATCM
(see Annex). The majority of these have been revisions of
plans for existing designated sites. But a number of draft
Management Plans for new area designations are under
consideration, or will be submitted shortly.

The intention of the drafters of Annex V was to draw a clear
distinction between mandatory provisions which are necessary
for strict protection within ASPAs, and the hortatory
provisions of a Code of Conduct for ASMAs. But this intended
distinction between the two may well have been blurred
subsequently due in part to the possibly ambiguous layout of
Annex V, (in particular Article 5, some of the provisions of
which are common, but some which apply only to ASPAs or only
to ASMAs), or to a misunderstanding of the rationale for
ASMAs.

There may as a consequence be some confusion as to the status
ASPAs AND ASMAs: THE DISTINCTION

The mandatory requirement for permits to enter an ASPA are set out in Article 3(4) and 5(3)(i) of Annex V. The non-mandatory (i.e. hortatory) nature of an ASMA is evident from:

-   Article 4(1), an area may be designated as an ASMA "to assist in the planning and co-ordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, co-operation between parties or minimise environmental impacts".

-   Article 4(3) "Entry into an ASMA shall not require a permit".

-   Article 5(3)(j), which provides only for a "Code of Conduct" for an ASMA.

MANAGEMENT PLANS

The format for Management Plans for both ASPAs and ASMAs is set out in Article 5 of Annex V.

It is evident that:

-   Article 5(3)(i) relates solely to ASPAs in dealing with the conditions for granting a permit;

-   Article 5(3)(j) relates solely to ASMAs in indicating which elements should be addressed in a Code of Conduct;

-   Article 5(3)(a)-(h) relates to both ASPAs and ASMAs, as appropriate.

the terms "special protection" (for ASPAs) and "management"
3
activities to be "prohibited, restricted or managed". The 
term "prohibited" refers to ASPAs and "managed" to ASMAs. 
"Restricted" could apply to either, there being some overlap 
in the functions of protection and management.

Therefore, for mandatory provisions, such as prohibitions, 
to be included in Management Plans for ASMAs would not only 
run counter to the intention of the drafters of Annex V, as 
indicated by the concept of a Code of Conduct, but might 
well be difficult to enforce in law.

CONCLUSIONS

The United Kingdom believes that clear distinction between 
ASPAs and ASMAs should be maintained. Management Plans for 
ASPAs may contain provisions intended to be legally binding, 
with access prohibited except in accordance with a permit. 
Management Plans for ASMAs should, on the other hand, be 
couched in no more than hortatory language set out in a Code 
of Conduct. The UK considers that this distinction should 
be made clear at the XXth ATCM.

The above does not preclude the possibility of having ASPAs 
and ASMAs physically adjacent to each other, or indeed 
having an ASPA actually within the area of an ASMA. But in 
such situations each Area should be regarded as discrete and 
governed by its own Management Plan.

c)     Review and Implementation of the Antarctic Protected
Areas System

(111) The United Kingdom Delegation was concerned about the possible
use of mandatory prohibitions within the Management Plans for Antarctic
Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs) and asked for the Meeting to discuss
and clarify the situation in the light of the distinctions made in Articles 4
and 5 of Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty. Several delegations agreed with the need for this
clarification.

The Representative of SCAR added that it would be helpful for this question
to be resolved before the XIX ATCM in order to provide guidance in
finalising the management plans for the first Antarctic Specially Managed
Area (Admiralty Bay) being drafted by Brazil and Poland.

(112) Clarification of this matter was not obtained at this Meeting.
However, such clarification will be necessary before designation of any
Antarctic Specially Managed Areas under Article 6 of Annex V to the
Protocol.
