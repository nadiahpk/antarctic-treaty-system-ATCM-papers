SANAE IV                                                          CEE FOLLOW UP REPORT

FOLLOW UP REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL
COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION (CEE)

[The presentation of this report is consistent with the approach on CEE follow up
procedures outlined in Information Paper No 63 tabled jointly by New Zealand and
South Africa at ATCM XIX.]

1       THE SANAE IV PROJECT

The SANAE IV Antarctic base is presently under construction on the inland
nunatak Vesleskarvet 200 km from the ice shelf edge in Queen Maud Land,
Antarctica. It replaces the old SANAE III base. The final report on the draft CEE
was released in October 1993. Construction activities commenced during the
1993/1994 summer season and continued for the consecutive 1994/1995 and
1995/1996 summer seasons. The new base will be commissioned during the
1996/1997 Antarctic summer.

2       SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES COMPLETED SINCE RELEASE OF THE FINAL
        CEE

The temporary base for construction personnel at Vesleskarvet was completed
after the CEE was finalised. During the following annual summer seasons
ranging from December to February most of the construction material and
equipment, approximately 1500 tonnes per season, were transported to the
depots at the construction site.

The vehicle fleet has grown over the three consecutive seasons to expedite the
construction of the base. Challenger hauling vehicles, flat bed cargo sledges
and Russian Vityaz vehicles were used to move construction material and other
cargo between the ship off loading point and the construction site. Special
tanker sledges were designed for transporting polar diesel to the fuel storage
facility of SANAE IV. At the construction site, D6 and D4 Caterpillars of which
some were fitted with cranes were used for construction and snow moving
tasks. Skidoos and skidoo sledges provided on site transport for construction
personnel while air support was provided by two J-model Puma helicopters.

Before the 1995/96 summer season departure to Antarctica an operational
document for personnel was compiled comprising of a detailed summer
season programme, organizational structure, activity scheduling, depot layouts,
communication procedures, technical information, waste management
procedures and a code of conduct. This document was distributed to all
personnel before departure. Environmental awareness was encouraged
through workshops and information sessions.

The shells of buildings A and B have been completed successfully, as well as
the floor of building C, the helicopter landing pad and the fuel storage facility.
Most of the inside furnishing of building A was also completed during the last
summer.

3       COMPLIANCE WITH THE CEE AND PROPOSED CHANGES

Monitoring of compliance to the CEE, as a specific requirement of the Protocol
on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol), has
been conducted since the project commenced in the Antarctic summer of
1993/1994.

SANAE IV                                  CEE FOLLOW UP REPORT

The construction of SANAE IV has been progressing at a slower pace than was construed when the CEE was performed. As a result of the changed project schedule and experience gained, certain changes in modus operandi was inevitable. Although this lead to the occurrence of some inconsistencies with the CEE, all activities still remained within the requirements of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol).

Areas of noncompliance to the CEE as well as new activities are detailed below:

3.1 Route followed to Vesleskarvet (Draft CEE 2.1.2)

A new and shorter route was established between SANAE III and SANAE IV during the 1994/1995 summer season. The new route turns south-east from the old route at Robertskollen and heads for Lorentzenpiggen before turning east, approaching the construction site directly around the southern side of Vesleskarvet. At Vesleskarvet the route passing the construction base (Draft CEE Figure 7) was also altered to pass between the construction base and the rocky outcrop to it's south, as a shorter alternative and keeping traffic away from the snow melter area.

3.2 Schedule change (Draft CEE 3.6.1)

The CEE stated that the construction phase of SANAE IV would stretch over the two Antarctic summers of 1993/1994 and 1994/1995 only. Owing to logistic difficulties, the construction period was extended. The base will now be commissioned during the 1996/1997 Antarctic summer and construction is expected to continue until the end of the following summer.

3.3 Personnel requirements (Draft CEE 3.6.2)

Personnel requirements increased since construction started and entailed the following during the last summer season:

SANAE IV                                  CEE FOLLOW UP REPORT

PENGUIN BUKTA
  - DPW support team:                    10

TEMPORARY PERSONNEL
  - Support personnel which did not stay for
    the entire summer season:            25

3.4 Vehicle requirements (Draft CEE 3.6.3)

A third D6 Caterpillar was fitted with a crane and the transport fleet has
been increased to the following:
  - 3 X short wheel base Challengers and 2 X long wheel base
    Challengers for hauling cargo sledges,
  - 18 X 20 t flat bed cargo sledges for moving cargo from the bukta depots to Vesleskarvet,
  - 10 X 19 000 L tanker sledges for moving polar diesel from the ship to Vesleskarvet,
  - 27 X skidoos and 12 X skidoo sledges.

3.5 Accommodation requirements (Draft CEE 3.6.4)

Thirteen additional accommodation containers were placed at the
construction base to provide for the larger personnel component during
the last summer season. These containers were removed to a depot at the
end of the summer season. Additional containers were also added to the
generator room, bathroom, kitchen and lounge. These containers were
positioned on steel supports and were not removed at the end of the
summer season.

3.6 Erection of an Intelsat satellite dish

During the 1995/1996 summer season the Intelsat satellite dish used at
SANAE III was moved to SANAE IV and erected north of the helipad inside
the area allowed for construction activities.

3.7 Open burning of untreated crate timber (Draft CEE 4.2.1)

The CEE clearly states the South African National Antarctic Programme's
(SANAP) decision to prohibit the burning of any solid waste. Owing to the
difficulty to strap, transport and transfer large timber panels safely to the
ship, timber material soon started accumulating on the stripping depot at
the construction terrain. After the 1994/1995 summer season an
environmental management workshop was held to find solutions for the
problems encountered during that summer season. It was then decided
to conduct an IEE on the possibility of burning the crate timber. The IEE
showed that the activity would have no more than a minor or transitory
impact. Consequently the open burning of approximately 50 tonnes of
untreated timber material was allowed within the requirements of Annex
III to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty:
Article 3, as an interim arrangement under the following conditions:

  - only untreated timber material may be burned,
  - burning may only take place at the old SANAE III in a designated area
    where burning have been permitted in the past.
  - burning may only take place under strict supervision, and
  - the arrangement only apply to the construction phase.

SANAE IV                                                              CEE FOLLOW UP REPORT

3.8 Preliminary Environmental, Health and Safety System (EHSMS)

- The on site EHS management structure expanded. (Final CEE, 3.3)
- The waste management plan was reviewed. (Final CEE, 3.4) A copy 
of the revised waste management plan can be obtained from the 
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.
- The audit programme was extended to include health and safety 
aspects. (Final CEE, 3.8). The results are covered in the latest internal 
audit report.
- The audit scope was extended to include the 1995/1996 summer 
season and will be ongoing. (Final CEE, 3.8.3)
- The entire audit team was replaced by new personnel. (Final CEE, 
3.8.3)
- The Code of Conduct was updated annually to adjust to changing 
activities and deficiencies. (Draft CEE, Chapter 4) A copy of the 
updated Code of Conduct can be obtained from the Department of 
Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

3.9 Departmental name change

The name of the Department of Environmental Affairs has changed to the 
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism since the final CEE was 
released.

4    CONCLUSION

The Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS) is 
proving to be an important management tool for integrating environmental and 
other management concerns. It also provides a continuous guideline for 
conduct to personnel visiting Antarctica. It is believed that the implementation 
of an EHSMS, as submitted in Seoul (XIX ATCM/INF 55), will hold particular 
benefits for all consultative parties with regard to the efficient management of 
environmental aspects within national Antarctic programmes.
