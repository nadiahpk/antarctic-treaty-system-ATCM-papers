PROPOSED CHANGES TO AGENDA ITEMS FOR
ATCM XXI

SITES OF HISTORIC INTEREST

It is not clear from the present agenda under which item sites of historic interest 
should be considered. Australia proposes that sites of historic interest be considered 
under the item on the Antarctic Protected Area System and proposes this agenda 
item be reworded as follows:

Antarctic Protected Area System and Historic Sites

a)  Proposals for Revised and New Management Plans

b)  Historic Sites

c)  Site Inspections

d)  Means for Evaluating Possible Gaps in the System

INSPECTIONS UNDER THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

Sub-item (a) under this item currently reads "Inspections during 1995/96 and 
those planned for 1996/97".

Australia points out that it is not always possible to complete a full inspection report 
deriving from an Antarctic summer program in time for the next Treaty meeting.

Australia is also concerned about calling specifically for advice on inspections 
planned for the following year as there is no requirement under the Treaty for such 
advance notice. While it is accepted that Parties are not required to indicate their 
intentions, it is not considered to be in the interests of the Parties to have to report 
that no party indicated an intention to conduct an inspection. At the same time 
Australia has no objection to any Party indicating an intention to conduct an 
inspection, if it wishes, and having this recorded in the report.

Accordingly, Australia suggests that this agenda sub-item be worded simply as 
"Inspections", which allows reports on any previous inspections and also for Parties 
to advise on planned inspections if this is their wish. Thus the item would be 
reworded as follows:

Inspections under the Antarctic Treaty

a)  Inspections

b)  Inspection Checklists
