Liability annex to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty

(No. 6b of the agenda)

In order to continue the work on an Annex on Liability to the Protocol, Germany submits
the following proposal to the Consultative Meeting:

1.	The Consultative Meeting takes notice of the work of legal experts on liability as
reported by the Chairman of the Group.

2.	The Consultative Meeting extends, in accordance with Recommendation IV-24, the
mandate of the Meeting of Legal Experts on Liability on the basis of the draft
elaborated by Prof. Wolfrum.

3.	The Consultative Meeting agrees to convene another meeting of legal experts before
the XXIIth Consultative Meeting in New Zealand.

4.	The Consultative Meeting expresses its hope that as a result of these meetings of legal
experts, a draft of an Annex on Liability can be presented to the XXIIth Consultative
Meeting for further discussion.
