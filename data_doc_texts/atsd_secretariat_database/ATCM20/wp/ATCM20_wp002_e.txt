THE TIMING OF ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

INTRODUCTION

The timing of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings was raised at the XIXth meeting with the suggestion that the matter be considered further at ATCM XX. Para 139(ii) of the report of the last meeting indicates that a number of Delegations suggested that, as from 1997, the regular ATCM should take place in June.

This paper sets out the rationale for the current timing of the Consultative Meeting, and concludes that the present timetabling be retained.

BACKGROUND

Up to ATCM XVI (Bonn, 1991) the regular Consultative Meeting had been held:

(a) biennially,

(b) in the northern hemisphere autumn (usually in October/November and immediately before or after the annual meeting of the CCAMLR Commission), and

(c) had been preceded by a week-long Preparatory Meeting, normally held in May, at which the agenda for the main meeting was adopted and procedural matters dealt with.

RATIONALE FOR THE CHANGE

At ATCM XVI the Treaty Parties agreed (paras 134-136) that from then onwards the ATCM should be held annually and that its timing should switch to the first half of the year. It was also agreed that the move to annual meetings made Preparatory Meetings unnecessary.

The principle reasons for these switches were:-

-   a recognition that the increasing range and complexity of issues coming before the ATCPs warranted more frequent meetings; and

-   the need to adopt procedures to give effect to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

THE TIMING OF ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS

Agenda Item 22(a)

(Submitted by the United Kingdom)
The switch to annual Meetings occurred between the XVIth and XVIIth ATCMs (1991/1992); the switch from the second to the first halves of the year between the XVIIth and XVIIIth ATCMs (1992/94). To address the loss of the Preparatory Meeting the Rules of Procedure were amended at ATCM XVII (Venice, 1992).

TIMING OF MEETING

Although no prescribed date had formally been fixed for the revised-style ATCM, the XVIIIth and XIXth Meetings were held in April/May. ATCM XX has been similarly timed. This was not determined arbitrarily. Rather, it reflects the requirements of the Environmental Protocol and in particular the obligations of the Parties relating to Environmental Impact Assessments.

Annex I to the Protocol sets out a rigourous timetable for the submission and processing of draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs). Article 3 requires draft CEEs to be circulated to Parties, and the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), at least 120 days before the next ATCM. 90 days must be allowed for the receipt of comments. However, the decision to proceed with an activity subject to a CEE may not be delayed for longer than 15 months from the date of circulation of the draft CEE. In addition at least 60 days must elapse between circulation of the final CEE and commencement of the proposed activity in the Antarctic Treaty area.

In determining how best to meet the requirements of this timetable Parties were sensitive to the need not to unduly delay the commencement of activities in Antarctica. The CEE process already has a maximum 15 months procedure written in (this does not of course include the time spent actually preparing the draft CEE). To ensure that an activity can proceed at least in the austral year following that at which a draft CEE had been examined, it is necessary that the ATCM is held as early in the year as possible. An April/May meeting allows for an activity which requires a CEE to go forward, at maximum, by March/April of the following year (see Fig.  1). But even this would then allow barely six months for the placing of orders for equipment and material, assembling of personnel and their transportation to Antarctica to enable activities to commence in the austral season beginning October/November.

It is important to realise that generally a CEE will be 
associated with major infrastructure work. This probably 
means that the necessary materials can only be transported to 
Antarctica by ship, not air - again reinforcing the need for 
an early ATCM and adequate preparation time following the 
decision to proceed with an activity. Even with the existing 
timetable a northern hemisphere state has barely two months to 
purchase and load stores to meet a sailing date of September.

Clearly there needs to be a balance between (a) timing the 
ATCM for as early as possible in the year (to provide for 
adequate preparatory time for the activity) but (b) 
sufficiently after the end of the austral field season to 
enable papers to be prepared and Antarctic Consultative Meeting 
technical/scientific staff to attend the Consultative Meeting.

It was to accommodate these two conflicting needs that the 
dates of April/May were agreed to.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF MOVING THE DATE TO JUNE

Were the ATCM to be moved to later in the year it would 
provide greater accommodation for (b) above. However, even a 
small shift of 1-2 months could introduce disproportionate 
delays in the implementation of an activity in Antarctica. 
Certainly, work on any major construction project would be 
delayed by at least one further year. The practical result of 
a switch to a June ATCM would be that the timetable from the 
point of submission of a CEE to actually commencing the work 
would be from February in year 1 (120 days before the ATCM) to 
October/November in year 3 - a total of 33 months (see Fig. 
1(b)).

CONCLUSION

The United Kingdom's view is that, whilst not ideal, holding 
the ATCM in April or early May is the only way of meeting the 
timetable for the EIA procedures laid down in the Protocol 
without unduly delaying implementation of activities in 
Antarctica. The existing date of the ATCM ought to be 
sufficient to enable adequate preparation for, and attendance 
of, the Consultative Meeting by scientists and technical 
staff.

The present April/May date be should therefore be retained.
