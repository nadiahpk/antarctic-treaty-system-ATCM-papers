RENUMBERING OF ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREAS

(Agenda item 20)

RENUMBERING OF ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREAS

Submitted by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom

Annex V of the Environmental Protocol which addresses Area
Protection and Management requires that existing Antarctic
protected areas (Specially Protected Areas and Sites of
Special Scientific Interest) be renamed and renumbered.

  • At the XIXth ATCM (Seoul, 1995) the Parties decided that such
renumbering could take place in advance of the approval of
Recommendation XIV-10 under Article IX of the Treaty.  A
scheme of renumbering based on three digit numbers was put
forward and agreed (see para 101 of the XIX ATCM report).

  • Furthermore, the Parties agreed that existing SPAs would
become ASPAs 101 through 124, and existing SSSIs would become
ASPAs 125 through 160 with new areas numbered from 161
onwards.

  • On reflection, we believe some modification needs to be made
to this scheme to take account of the 'gaps' in the existing
numbering. These gaps have been created by sites being
redesignated. For example, SPAs Nos 6, 10, 11 and 12 have
been redesignated as SSSIs 4, 6, 32 and 5 respectively,
thereby leaving gaps between SPAs Nos 5 and 7 and 9 and 13.
We recommend that such gaps in numbering should now be filled.

  • In addition, there are two examples where a SPA lies within a
SSSI. These are SPA No 20 within SSSI No 10 and SPA No 22
within SSSI No 24. Under the existing proposal these four
sites would become four ASPAs in their own right. Rather than
creating matrix sites consisting of two ASPAs in juxtaposition
we recommend that SPA No 20 be amalgamated with SSSI No 10 and
that SPA No 22 and SSSI No 24 be dealt with similarly. Were
different management regimes required within what were the two
former adjacent sites then this could be catered for by
management prescriptions and zoning within a unified Annex V
Management Plan.

Lastly, we also propose that the new numbers for ASPAs should 
be introduced at the time Annex V Management Plans are adopted 
by the ATCM for any protected area.  This would allow ready 
identification of those protected areas that have new or 
revised Management Plans.

A proposed new numbering system is attached at Annex I.
