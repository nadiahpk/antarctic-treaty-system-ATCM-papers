DRAFT RESOLUTION ON A NUCLEAR-TEST-BAN TREATY AND COOPERATION BY ANTARCTIC TREATY PARTIES WITH A INTERNATIONAL MONITORING SYSTEM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CTBT

Recalling the provision of the Antarctic Treaty, in particular article V, as being the first multilateral legal instrument to ban nuclear explosions and the dumping of nuclear waste in Antarctica;

Convinced that the Antarctic Treaty has proved effective in promoting international harmony in furtherance of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in ensuring the absence of any measure of a military measure and the protection of the Antarctic environment and in promoting the freedom of scientific research in Antarctica;

Bearing in mind the designation of Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science in the Protocol for Environmental Protection of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that the Conference on Disarmament has undertaken to negotiate a universal and multilaterally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, whose purpose and objectives are to extend to all environments and for all times the prohibitions contained in Article V of the Antarctic Treaty;

Aware that to ensure the observance of the provisions of the above mentioned treaty, the establishment of an International Monitoring System (IMS) comprising a network of seismic, radionuclide, hidroacoustic and infrasound stations connected to a International Data Centre (IDC) is being implemented on a global scale;

Taking note that, in order to fulfil its technical and operational requirements, the primary and auxiliary networks of the IMS must be supported from the Continent of Antarctica and that a number of seismic, radionuclide and infrasound stations located in Antarctic bases are now committed to the IMS;

Acknowledging the substantial contribution to scientific knowledge resulting from international cooperation within the IMS and convinced that activities to promote compliance with a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty reinforce the purpose and objectives of the Antarctic Treaty;

The Antarctic Treaty Parties,

1. Welcome the negotiation of a universal and multilaterally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.

2. Fully support the establishment of an International Monitoring System (IMS) and an 
International Data Centre (IDC) to ensure compliance with the above mentioned treaty.

3. Command the Antarctic Treaty Parties taking responsibility for IMS facilities located in 
Antarctic bases and declare that each Antarctic Treaty Party shall cooperate in furthering the 
objectives of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban by participating in the exchange of 
seismological and other data required by the IMS;

4. Express the hope that the organisation envisaged by that treaty shall, in cooperation an 
consultation with its own members, with the Antarctic Treaty Parties and any other relevant 
international organization, establish, complete of needed, and coordinate the operation and 
maintenance and any future agreed modification or development of the International 
Monitoring System.

5. Pledge its continued support to the efforts made to obtain the discontinuance of all test 
explosions of nuclear weapons for all time and reaffirm the historic role of the Antarctic 
Treaty in the systematic and progressive movement towards the reduction of nuclear 
weapons, the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and general and complete 
disarmament under strict and effective international control.
