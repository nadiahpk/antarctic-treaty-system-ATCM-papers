CONCERNING THE REGULATION OF THE EXTRACTION,
USE AND CUSTODY OF SCIENTIFIC SAMPLES

Agenda Item 10 c

(Submitted by SCAR/COMNAP)
SCAR-COMNAP INFORMATION PAPER TO XIX ATCM

Concerning the Regulation of the Extraction, Use and Custody of 
Scientific Samples

SCAR interest on this subject was expressed by SCAR Recommendation 
XXII-1 on geological specimens of scientific value that are being removed 
from Antarctica for non-scientific reasons.

Curatorial practices are routinely used by scientific organizations engaged in 
Antarctic research, for example: the management scheme for scientific 
specimens used by the National Institute of Polar Research and described in 
the Working Paper submitted by the Delegation of Japan at XVIII ATCM; and 
the library of Antarctic marine sediment cores maintained by Florida State 
University. These collections and their catalogue descriptions are a type of 
scientific data.

Improved access to information on Antarctic scientific specimens for the 
purposes of planning and developing an Antarctic research programme could 
be provided by the inclusion of information on existing collections within the 
Antarctic Data Directory System.

SCAR and COMNAP have been encouraged by the Antarctic Treaty Parties in 
the development of digital information storage such as that currently being 
negotiated to provide an international directory of databases holding Antarctic 
scientific data in SCAR member countries.  This database will constitute an 
Antarctic Master Directory to which contributions will be made through 
National Antarctic Data Centres as the major part of the Antarctic Data 
Directory System. The database will help to systematically organize the use 
and custody of Antarctic collections and will make such records accessible to 
the international Antarctic scientific community.
