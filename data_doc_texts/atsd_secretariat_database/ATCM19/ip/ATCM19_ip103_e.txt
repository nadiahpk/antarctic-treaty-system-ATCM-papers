REPORT BY THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME
TO THE XIXth ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING

Agenda Item 5
(Submitted by UNEP)
Report by the United Nations Environment Programme to the XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), Seoul, Republic of Korea, May 8-19, 1995

This report is submitted pursuant to Article III(2), under Agenda item 5 of this ATCM.

In September, 1994, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reported on the state of the Antarctic environment at the request of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his report on the Question of Antarctica to the 49th General Assembly of the United Nations.

UNEP was requested by the First Committee of the 49th General Assembly to provide directly to that Committee any additional environmental information it or its members may need to address the agenda item on Antarctica. In November, 1994, UNEP confirmed to an informal subgroup of that Committee, convened by Malaysia, its attendance as an expert at the XVIIIth ATCM and the full accessibility to UNEP of the environmental discussions held and materials distributed there. UNEP also confirmed its invitation to participate as an expert under similar conditions at this, the XIXth ATCM. The resolution on the question of Antarctica was adopted by the First Committee by consensus without a vote and was subsequently endorsed on the report of the First Committee by the General Assembly. The agenda item on the question of Antarctica will be taken up again by the 51st General Assembly in 1996. UNEP will then again be requested to deliver a report on the state of the environment in Antarctica.

UNEP's provision of comprehensive and objective environmental information to the report of the Secretary-General is considerably facilitated by UNEP's presence at the meetings of the ATCM and the assistance accorded to it by the Parties for receipt of information documents and working papers. UNEP's work on this matter has been and currently continues to be done within its own existing resources.

UNEP stands ready to explore with the Parties any suggestions they might wish to make for its possible contributions to the environmental work of the Parties as they deem appropriate in general, and specifically a) as indicated in WP 20 (Relation Between the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and Other International Agreements of a Global Scope, submitted by Chile), and b) as may also arise out of Action Point No. 5 in INF 54 (International Seminar on the Future of the Antarctic Treaty System, submitted by Argentina/Australia). UNEP is also ready to cooperate with the other observers and experts at the ATCM on matters which advance the shared interest of all in the environmentally sound management of Antarctica.
