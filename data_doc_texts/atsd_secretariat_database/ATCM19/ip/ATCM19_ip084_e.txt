OPENING ADDRESS BY MR. J.V.R.PRASADA RAO,
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF INDIA

Mr. Chairman,

●	On behalf of the Indian delegation, I like to express our deep appreciation to 
the Government of the Republic of Korea for hosting the XIXth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting and for the excellent facilities and hospitality extended to 
us in this beautiful city of Seoul.

●	India, as a Consultative Party is actively involved in the Antarctic Treaty 
Regime that includes scientific associations like SCAR, CCAMLR and 
organizations looking after Antarctic logistics like COMNAP and SCALOP. We 
have so far successfully launched 14 expeditions to the icy continent and one 
special expedition to the Weddel Sea area.  The scientific programmes are 
evolved on a long-term basis in areas like atmospheric sciences, earth sciences, 
biological sciences, human physiology and environment.  Some of the research 
papers published by the scientists have got world-wide recognition and found 
mention in important scientific journals.

●	As one of the original sponsors of the Environment Protocol to the Antarctic 
Treaty, India has ensured compliance with the basic principle of the protocol 
right from the day of its adoption. We have endeavoured to keep the best 
environmental standards in and around the Indian station 'Maitri'.  The Swedish 
inspection team that visited our station has appreciated the general environmental 
standard of the station. The observations of the team have been considered for 
taking up follow-up measures with the help of national institutions like the 
National Environmental Engineering Research Institute.  An environmental audit 
of the station and the surrounding areas is on the anvil and a comprehensive 
report on the environment status of the station is likely to develop in the next 
couple of years. We have also initiated necessary steps for ratifying the 
Protocol.
During the last 2-3 years, we have substantially reduced the logistic 
component of the Antarctic team and increased the scientific component.  The 
total strength of the expedition has been brought down to about 60 every year, 
50% of whom are scientists working on thrust areas of Antarctic Research. We 
are trying to keep new infrastructural facilities to the minimum in 'Maitri' area 
and the on-going scientific programmes are well targeted for completion within 
the given time frame.

Even with the limited accommodation and facilities available in the Indian 
station 'Maitri', we have always tried to help developing countries in participating 
in our Antarctic programme in the past. Scientists from Mauritius and Colombia 
have earlier participated in our expeditions.  We welcome participation of 
scientists of other countries in our Antarcitc programme.  We also look forward 
for bilateral cooperation with other member countries on mutually beneficial 
scientific programmes.

The entry into force of the Protocol is a common priority objective for all of 
us. We hope that the process of ratification by all the Consultative Parties will 
be completed very shortly so that the Committee for Environmental Protection 
can be constituted.  We also like to see that in the interim period the Transitional 
Working Group takes up all environment related matters including the problem of 
tourism and tries to arrive at the best possible solution.  Matters related to the 
Liability Annex and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat also need an early and 
satisfactory solution. We are happy to see that both the TEWG and the Working 
Group on Liabity Annex have made impressive progress in their work last week. 
We congratulate the Chairmen of both these Groups for the excellent leadership 
they provided to arrive at a commonly acceptable formulation on various issues 
addressed by the Groups.

In all of these and other matters, our delegation will work in close 
cooperation with other delegations to arrive at decisions through consensus. We 
look forward to a fruitful conclusion of the meeting under your chairmanship.

Thank you.
