ATCM INFO PAPER FROM SCAR AND IUCN

SUBANTARCTIC ISLANDS

All of the subantarctic islands lie outside the Antarctic Treaty area and under a range of national jurisdictions. The islands share many of their biological features with the Antarctic and the waters surrounding them fall within the CCAMLR area of interest. Since many of the same species of birds and seals, as well as many cryptogamic plants and invertebrates, are found on the islands and in the Antarctic it is useful for those involved in conservation and environmental initiatives to be well-informed about activities in both areas. In addition most of the islands are now included periodically in the itineraries of tourist ships proceeding to the Antarctic.

The islands fall within the areas of interest for both SCAR and IUCN. In 1992, as part of a joint initiative on areas of common interest, SCAR and IUCN held a workshop in Paimpont, France to discuss conservation and environmental management on all the subantarctic islands. The proceedings of this workshop are now available and are provided to all Parties as background information. All the recommendations are addressed to relevant governments and will be forwarded through the appropriate National Committees of SCAR and IUCN.
