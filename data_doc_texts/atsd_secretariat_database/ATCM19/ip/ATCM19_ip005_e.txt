12   Telecommunications

The Antarctic Telecommunications Operator Manual (ATOM) has 
been distributed in quantity to all the national operators. Updates 
have been circulated as part of the SCALOP advance exchange of 
operational information. A SCALOP Working Group has under-
taken the task of updating and rewriting the ATOM Annexes.

13   AMEN

The Antarctic Managers Electronic Network has grown to include 
Internet addresses for 29 of the 64 individuals who are COMNAP 
or SCALOP members, representing half of the national programs. 
The file system of retrievable documents includes the current 
version of various lists plus all the material circulated by numbered 
MNAP and SCALOP Notices. In addition to these electronic mail 
and document transfer and retrieval functions, it is recognized that 
there should be information about the national programs in Ant-
arctica that is more broadly presented over the World Wide Web 
feature of the Internet.

9   Oil Spill Prevention and Response

The SCALOP Working Group has continued its work by
  • preparing guidelines for the prevention and re-
    sponse to oil spills at inland stations and field
    camps;
  • completing a survey of fuels and oils carried to 
    Antarctica in ships;
  • establishing the practice of reporting oil spills as 
    an internal record; and
  • providing a forum for discussion of maritime safety 
    and marine pollution topics by national operators.

10   Tourism and Nongovernmental 
Activities

The COMNAP Working Group on Antarctic Tourism and Nongov-
ernmental Activities has been tasked to continue to monitor devel-
opments, including the implementation of ATCM Rec. XVIII-1, as 
they involve national programs. Through the Working Group, 
COMNAP continues to nurture a cooperative relationship with the 
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators.

11   Air Operations

The SCALOP Working Group on Antarctic Air Operations met in 
Rome. The value of the Antarctic Flight Information Manual was 
reaffirmed, and attention was directed to improving the format of 
the information as required by ATCM Rec. XV-20 and properly 
publishing it in the smaller size that is standard for flight 
publications.

7   Contingency Planning

During their meeting in Rome, the national managers considered 
the growing importance of cooperation in contingency planning. 
They assigned a new Working Group to study the matter, to prepare 
a discussion paper, and to propose a way forward for the Council 
and individual members. Relevant to contingency planning, the 
meeting of COMNAP in Rome received a report and briefing by 
the Chairman of the WMO Working Group on Antarctic Meteor-
ology with regard to the question of requirements for the organi-
zation of a center for marine pollution response operations. The 
pertinent information from the XVIIIth ATCM and from the WMO 
will be considered further by the COMNAP Working Group on 
Contingency Response Planning. COMNAP has concluded, how-
ever, that there are no specific requirements at this time for the 
establishment of a Center for Antarctic Marine Pollution Response 
Operations.

8   Hydrographic Charting

COMNAP and SCALOP have continued the close liaison with the 
International Hydrographic Organization and its Permanent Work-
ing Group on Cooperation in Antarctica. The Director of the 
International Hydrographic Bureau addressed a special plenary 
session of SCALOP during the meetings in Rome and presented the 
draft of the IHO INT Chart Scheme for the Antarctic region. This 
IHO project is recognized as a major cooperative effort that will 
benefit the safety and efficiency of Antarctic ship operations and, 
as such, has been endorsed by COMNAP. In addition to helping 
to define the needs and priority for surveying and charting, the 
members of COMNAP assist by assuring that relevant navigational 
information is properly passed to national hydrographic offices.

4   Human Resources Management

Under this title a special session of the COMNAP meeting with a SCAR Working Group in Rome considered the prospects for adopting compatible medical screening criteria for national program travellers to Antarctica. In addition to common concerns for the health and safety of program personnel, the objective relates to interchangeability and cooperative activities. A joint SCAR/COMNAP workshop is being considered for SCAR XXIV in 1996.

5   Data Management

As a result of the work of a SCAR-COMNAP Joint Planning Group on Antarctic Data Management, a seminar was presented in Rome and an action plan was adopted. A call for proposals to operate the Antarctic Master Directory was jointly issued by SCAR and COMNAP, and National Antarctic Data Centers are being identified.

6   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment

Work on this topic has moved forward through close liaison between COMNAP and SCAR. A COMNAP Working Group organized in Rome has continued the process of selection and nomination of stations as monitoring sites. In view of the timing of the planned First Environmental Monitoring Workshop it is intended that the latest results and status be introduced as a paper to the XIXth ATCM. Meanwhile, six environmental assessment reports by members were received by the COMNAP secretariat during 1994. Information sharing related to this work reflects the continued effectiveness and use of the 1992 Practical Guidelines.

3.1 The Sixth Symposium on Antarctic Logistics and Operations was   1.1 This report to the XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is 
conducted by SCALOP in Rome. Twenty-seven papers were pre-       submitted on behalf of the Council of Managers of National

2     International Cooperation in 
Science Support

2.1   A principal objective of COMNAP is to enable and expedite the 
evolution of international collaboration in Antarctic science and 
science support. The focus on this is primarily through the joint 
COMNAP/SCAR activities at the executive level and the working 
group level. In 1994, at the meeting in Rome, there was a special 
plenary of COMNAP and SCALOP members at which presenta-
tions by the President and Chief Officers of SCAR provided an 
overview of the large-scale programs, including global change 
research, which will depend on international cooperation and 
major logistic support. The ongoing effort is to develop a forward 
look (on the order of five years) of the support implications of all 
the large-scale international science programs that can be com-
pared with a similar assessment of the collective international 
posture and plans for logistic capabilities.

2.2   The COMNAP meeting venues are used for smaller meetings of 
two or more national managers and their staffs to plan the support 
of international Antarctic science projects. To illustrate, two cur-
rent examples are selected.

2.2.1   The Cape Roberts Project

The program managers, scientists, and operations and logistics 
experts from the national programs of Germany, Italy, New Zea-
land, the United Kingdom, and the United States have collaborated 
to plan and undertake a five-year project to recover 1500 meters 
of core from the seafloor at a site near Cape Roberts off the Victoria

Land coast in the southwestern Ross Sea. Research on the core 
will establish the climate and vegetation of a high-latitude conti-
nental setting during the period before Cenozoic Antarctic glacia-
tion was established around 36 million years ago. The results will 
help test models of global climate and sea level change and also 
of the interaction between mountain building and glaciation. 
During the 1994-1995 season the Italian, U.S., and New Zealand 
programs cooperated using the Italian ship Italica to place 280 
tons of cargo at the site. Drilling is planned for 1996 and 1997. 
Environmental assessment and protection measures have been 
included in the planning.

2.2.2   The Dome C Project

The National programs of France and Italy have jointly planned a 
major long-term project to build and operate a scientific station at 
Dome C in East Antarctica to be called Base Concordia. The base 
will support a range of science (e.g., meteorology, upper atmos-
pheric physics, astronomy, etc.) including deep ice core drilling as 
part of the European Project for Ice coring in Antarctica (EPICA). 
EPICA currently plans to extract two deep ice cores: one in 
Dronning Maud Land, the other at Concordia. At the latter site, 
drilling through the 4000-meters-thick ice sheet may retrieve ice 
cores older than 500,000 years. Other European countries such 
as the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, 
Norway, and Sweden are part of EPICA, while the entire project is 
open to the participation of other countries. The environmental 
assessment has been performed, and transport of construction 
materials and fuel has already begun; deep drilling operations are 
to begin in 1997/1998.
