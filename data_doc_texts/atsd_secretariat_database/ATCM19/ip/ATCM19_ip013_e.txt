Recent developments in Antarctic tourism

Recent growth in Antarctic tourist activity

Record numbers of tourists continue to visit the Antarctic Treaty Area (south of 60° S
latitude). Totals from the 1989/90, 1990/91, 1991/92, 1992/93 and 1993/94 seasons for
airborne and seaborne activity were 2,581, 4,842, 6,567, 7,222 and 7,933 respectively. This
represents a three-fold increase in the last five years. More than 42% of all shipborne tourists
who have ever been to the Antarctic travelled there during the 1990/91, 1991/92, 1992/93 and
1993/94 seasons. Between January 1958 and March 1994, a total of 462 cruises have carried
more than 60,000 tourists to the Antarctic. Table 1 provides details. Figures 1 to 3 illustrate
the increases in Antarctic cruise tourists, cruises made and ships used to make cruises.1

Scale of tourist activity during the 1993/94 season

During the 1993/94 season eleven cruise ships brought 7,760 tourists to the Antarctic.2 This
record high total represents an increase of more than 11% over the previous season's record
high of 6,983 cruise ship tourists. Thirteen tour operators made a total of 66 Antarctic cruises
during the 1993/94 season; each visited the Antarctic Peninsula. For the first time, one also
went to the Weddell Sea. Two also visited the Ross Sea region. In all, nearly 5% more
cruises than were made during the previous season. Just over 83% of cruise tourists travelled
aboard ships operated by members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour
Operators (IAATO), an increase of 11% over the previous season.3 Furthermore, it is
estimated that at least 30 tourists travelled to Antarctica aboard Chilean navy vessels. Table
2 lists the ships and tour operators in the Antarctic during the 1993/94 season.

A total of 3,281 berths aboard cruise ships went unused during the 1993/94 season. On 
average, cruise ships travelled more than 70% full. Had all cruises been fully booked, a total 
of 11,041 passengers would have visited Antarctica.

Private commercial aircraft operated by Adventure Network International (ANI) carried 69 
passengers to the interior, primarily for mountain climbing trips or visits to the geographic 
South Pole; Aérovias DAP of Punta Arenas brought tourists to Chile's Teniente Rodolfo 
Marsh Station on King George Island aboard nine flights using King Air and Twin Otter 
aircraft; a third company brought a total of eight passengers and crew aboard a DC-6B that 
crashed near Patriot Hills.4

At least ten yachts visited the Antarctic during the 1993/94 season; three made more than one 
trip and at least four carried fare-paying passengers. Table 3 provides yacht names, 
destinations and other details. In all, nearly 8,000 tourists visited the Treaty Area during the 
1993/94 season; more than 97% of them travelled aboard cruise ships.

1994/95 season activity: preliminary statistics

NSF estimated that more than 8,000 tourists would visit Antarctica aboard 99 cruises during 
the 1994/95 season.5 Further information supporting the NSF estimate was circulated by the 
US Department of State as part of Treaty exchange of information procedures.6 Airborne, 
yacht and government-affiliated tourism will also contribute to what may prove to be a record 
high season of Antarctic tourist activity.

Significant trends

The number of Antarctic tour operators continues to increase. At least thirteen cruise 
operators made trips during the 1993/94 season; four of these were operating in the Treaty 
Area for the first time. Some of these companies hired staff with previous Antarctic 
experience. Of the twelve operators known to have carried passengers during the 1992/93 
season, five did not return during the 1993/94 season. In comparison, ten operators brought 
tourists during the 1991/92 season and seven carried passengers during the 1990/91 season.7

The increased numbers of European operators and passengers noted during the 1991/92 and 
1992/93 seasons were sustained during the 1993/94 season when at least four cruise 
operators8 carried 2,603 passengers, the majority of whom were European.  This figure 
accounts for more than one-third of all Antarctic cruise ship passengers that season.  Other 
cruise ships also carried Europeans. For example, figures reported to the US National Science 
Foundation by tour operators organized in the United States revealed that nearly 24% of the 
passengers they carried were European.9

Only a few ships (from one to four), carried Antarctic tourists each season prior to 1987/88. 
This is changing as increasing numbers of ships are used to carry greater numbers of tourists 
to the Treaty Area (see Table 1). At least a dozen ships have been used for tourism each 
season since 1991/92. Table 4 shows the growth in Antarctic shipborne tourism by decade.

An increasing number of Antarctic sites are used for tourism, especially as new areas are 
visited. Landings were made at 69 sites in the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Ross 
Sea regions during the 1993/94 season by the operators that reported to NSF.10  In
3
comparison, the operators that reported to NSF following the 1992/93 season visited 51 sites 
in the Antarctic Peninsula region.11  Table 5 lists the five tourist landing sites in the 
Antarctic visited most often during the past three seasons. For the operators that reported to 
NSF, the site visited by the most tourists during the 1993/94 season was Port Lockroy, 
Wiencke Island; 30 visits were made by a total of 4,274 tourists.

Recent developments in Antarctic tourism

Qantas re-introduced overflights of Antarctica during the 1994/95 season. The six Boeing 747 
flights that were marketed12 proved very popular and more are planned for the 1995/96 
season.13

Helicopter tours are being offered by an increasing number of Antarctic tour operators. 
During the 1993/94 season, Antarctic helicopter flights were available aboard at least three 
ships: Marco Polo, Sagafjord14, and Kapitan Khlebnikov.15

40% of Antarctic cruise passengers (3,093) travelled aboard ships with a capacity of 250 or 
more during the 1993/94 season; down from 50% (3,447 passengers) during the 1992/93 
season (see Table 2). An increase in tourist numbers travelling aboard larger ships is 
expected after the 1994/95 season if current plans made by several operators are carried out.

The US National Science Foundation held its sixth annual meeting with Antarctic tour 
operators at its new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia on 14 July 1994. The second meeting 
of German government officials and Antarctic tour operators organized in Germany was held

4
in Bremerhaven on 13 October 1994. Its main aim was to discuss the implications of 

Protocol implementing legislation that became effective in September 1994.

The standardized tourism reporting forms developed by the International Centre for Antarctic 
Information and Research (ICAIR) are a positive development that will provide useful 
information for the Antarctic policy making process if operators comply with reporting 
provisions. The forms were first distributed during the 1993/94 season and were revised for 
a wide distribution during the 1994/95 season.

The research team from the Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, 
investigating Antarctic tourism conducted its fourth season of fieldwork in the Antarctic 
Peninsula during the 1994/95 season. The tourism research component of the Long-Term 
Ecological Research (LTER) Project on Torgersen Island designed by US scientists planned 
its second consecutive season of fieldwork during the same time frame.

Lars-Eric Lindblad, who pioneered Antarctic cruise ship tourism, died on 8 July 1994 in 
Sweden.16

Conclusions

A record number of tourists visited the Antarctic during the 1993/94 season. Recent trends 
and developments indicate numbers are likely to continue to grow. The first tourist cruise 
to the Weddell Sea was made during the 1993/94 season. Increasing numbers of ships and 
helicopters are being used for Antarctic tours, more cruises are being made and more sites 
are being visited. Overflights of Antarctica have resumed and more are scheduled for the

5
1995/96 season.  The standardized reporting forms that have been developed by ICAIR 
provide a means by which to coordinate the collection of data on increasing levels of 
Antarctic tourist activity.  Such action will ultimately assist the Antarctic policy making 
process.

on shipborne tourism between the 1958/59 and 1965/66 seasons. The sudden rise 
in the number of shipborne tourists during the 1974/75 season is attributable to 
cruises offered by large ships with capacities of 474 and 800 respectively. Source:

Table 5      The five tourist landing sites in the Antarctic visited most often during the
            1991/92, 1992/93 and 1993/94 seasons, as reported by US-based tour operators
            to the US National Science Foundation. These figures are minimum estimates
            since some operators did not report to NSF (most notably for the 1992/93
            season) and others are not required to do so since they are based outside of the
            US. Sources: National Research Council21; NSF 1994f22.
