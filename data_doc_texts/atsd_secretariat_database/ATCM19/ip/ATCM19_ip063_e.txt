Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) follow up procedures

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty provides guidance on the production of CEEs (Annex 1, Article 3). It is less clear on the course of action that should be taken when changes occur after the final CEE is produced, other than monitoring requirements (Annex 1, Articles 5 and 6).

New Zealand and South Africa each presented a final CEE to ATCM XVIII. We are now implementing the activities covered by these CEEs. In the implementation process changes have occurred to the way the activity was described in the CEE.

Two issues in particular have arisen:

1. How does the implementation match the procedure outlined in the CEE.

2. What action should be taken if there is a change in procedure from that outlined in the CEE.

The approach we are taking to these issues is:

1. Review of the actual activity against the CEE

2. Reporting on the CEE implementation in the Exchange of Information, eg - activities completed in the year, any changes from the CEE.

3. Any changes from the original CEE are being treated in the same way as the original activity for which the CEE was prepared was treated - ie:
   - if the effect is likely to be less than minor or transitory it will be dealt with according to the programme's preliminary environmental evaluation procedures.
   - if the effect is likely to be "minor or transitory" an IEE will be prepared
   - another CEE would be required only if there was a major change in the activity compared to the CEE.
   - reporting on these evaluations as required under the Protocol

4. Report to ATCM XX on the outcome of this approach
