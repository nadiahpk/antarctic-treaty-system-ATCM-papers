SCIENTIFIC AND LOGISTIC COOPERATION

Information paper submitted by Australia

Australian Antarctic Program: International Cooperation In Antarctica

In 1991 Contracting Parties to the Antarctic Treaty nominated 1991 to 2000 as "a 
decade of international Antarctic cooperation". This paper updates and 
augments information provided in a paper to XVIII ATCM (INFO 79) outlining 
the efforts by Australia to facilitate international cooperation in Antarctica. 
Australian agencies with international linkages include the Australian Antarctic 
Division, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Antarctic 
Cooperative Research Centre and the Australian Antarctic Foundation.

Australia's Antarctic research program is focused on the large expanse of East 
Antarctica lying to the south and south-west of Australia. Three other Treaty 
Parties, France, Russia and China, maintain research programs in this region, 
and Australia has given operational support to, and received it from, each of 
these countries on occasions over recent years. An example in 1994-95 was the 
provision by Australia of helicopter support, at cost, to the Chinese National 
Antarctic Research Expedition operating in the Larsemann Hills and French 
support in picking up our expedition from Macquarie Island.

During 1995 Australia will be consulting with Chinese and Russian Antarctic 
program authorities to set ground rules for an environmental monitoring 
program in the Larsemann Hills (See XIX ATCM Agenda item 10a). The 
objective of this multilateral program will be to ensure that the impact of 
human activities in this important region is minimised, enabling its sustained 
long-term use for scientific purposes.

In the 1994-95 austral summer, Australian scientists have participated in the 
national programs of New Zealand, China and the United States in atmospheric 
and oceanographic research projects. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organisation (CSIRO) atmospheric physicists examining upper-
atmosphere ozone levels have participated in experimental work for the 
Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Expedition out of Christchurch, and an 
Australian scientist investigating climatically-active aerosol was based at the 
Chinese Great Wall station. CSIRO, as well as three Australian universities, was 
also involved with scientists on the US icebreaker R/V Nathaniel B Palmer in 
studies of Southern Ocean circulation at the Antarctic ice edge south of 
Australia.

In 1994, the Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean 
Environment (Antarctic CRC) was selected by SCAR to host the secretariat of 
the GLOCHANT (Global Change in Antarctica) program, designed to run for 
the next five to 10 years. Current Antarctic CRC research programs involve 
collaboration with scientists in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, 
Norway, Russia and USA. The Antarctic CRC is a joint venture between the 
Australian Antarctic Division, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation,
the Bureau of Meteorology, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organisation and the University of Tasmania.

The following tables list Australian Antarctic Program research projects 
involving formal cooperative links with other national or international research 
programs. In the 1994-95 season, a total of 40 Australian Antarctic research 
projects had international links, and the figure for 1995-96 (subject to approval) 
is 39.
