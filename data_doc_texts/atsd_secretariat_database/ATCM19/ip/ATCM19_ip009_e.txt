NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

1.Introduction

An Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) has been carried out by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) for 
the expansion of Rothera research station (67° 34'S, 68° 08'W), Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, Antarctica. 
The IEE has been prepared in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty.

2. Description of the activity

The BAS proposes that Rothera research station should be expanded to provide new facilities for biological 
research in Antarctica. The expansion will increase the efficiency of BAS operations, provide new 
opportunities for inshore marine and terrestrial biological research in high latitudes of Antarctica, increase the 
cooperation between the BAS and UK Higher Education Institutions and facilitate international collaboration. 
It will involve the construction and fitting out of a biological laboratory, summer accommodation, boathouse, 
powerhouse and a building to house a reverse osmosis water production plant during 1994/95 and 1995/96.

3. Alternatives

Three alternatives to the expansion have been examined:

i)      rebuild the British research station on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands;
ii)     use existing station facilities in the Antarctic Peninsula region;
ii)     do nothing and attempt to use the existing facilities at Rothera.

All three options were considered not viable due to a combination of financial, scientific, logistic and 
environmental reasons.

4. Description of the environment

Rothera Point is a sparsely vegetated gravel and low rock promontory without seal or penguin colonies. 
Skuas are the most abundant breeding and non-breeding birds. The terrestrial biota is very restricted in 
species diversity and abundance compared to other nearby ice-free areas.

5. Impact assessment

During construction of the expansion a direct impact will be disturbance of gravel during site preparation 
work. The total area likely to be affected is estimated as 10,000 m2. All construction work will, however, be 
carried out in the already impacted and levelled area on Rothera Point.

The operation of the expansion is predicted to give rise to both direct and cumulative impacts.

A direct terrestrial impact will be the local disturbance of flora and fauna on islands near to Rothera Point, 
particularly Lagoon Island, and in ice-free areas on Alexander Island because of the terrestrial biology 
research programme. Impacts from scientific research will include the formation of footpaths along 
frequently used routes, very localised damage from scientific experiments and minor sewage pollution from 
the operation of the small refuge hut on Lagoon Island and at tented field camps elsewhere.

Although sewage and domestic waste will be macerated before disposal, and hazardous laboratory chemicals 
will be prevented from entering the sewage system and removed from Antarctica for safe disposal in the UK, 
pollution from the station and laboratory waste outfall, located at North Beach, Rothera Point, will cause a 
direct marine impact. Elevated levels of nutrients, heavy metals, organic residues, suspended sediments and 
solids will occur in the immediate area of the outfall, but it is unlikely that the effluent would be detectable 
more than 200 m away from the discharge.

Marine impacts due to the inshore marine biological research programme are not likely. Local depletion of 
rare marine organisms will be prevented by strict controls on sampling.

−1−
The increase in the maximum number of people who will be working at Rothera during both the austral summer and winter will cause a cumulative impact in the local area. The maximum number that can be accommodated in summer will increase from 76 in 1993/94 to 124 in 1997/98. However, the full operating level of 120 people will only be reached for short periods, at the beginning and end of each field season, and will not be attained for some years. In winter, the maximum winter population will increase from 17 in 1993/94 to 30 in 1997/98 onwards. An important result of the increased numbers will be the increased quantities of waste that will be produced.

Another cumulative impact will be the addition of small facilities to enhance the scientific or logistical activities carried out at Rothera research station. On their own, such small-scale developments would be of little consequence but together they could lead to a slow and incremental degradation of the local area. To minimise disturbance all new buildings will be constructed within areas already disturbed by station activities, except those needed elsewhere for safety and emergency purposes.

The risk of a major oil spill at Rothera Point is very small given the controls already in place at the research station, and the level of risk will not be increased by the expansion. The main fuel tank farm is fully bunded and valved off. Comprehensive response measures are also in place in case of an oil spill, including a station oil spill contingency plan and on-site clean-up equipment and materials.

6. Mitigating measures

Appropriate measures are recommended to mitigate any adverse impacts of the expansion.

For construction activities, three major mitigation measures have been or will be adopted:

i)     environmental requirements were included as part of the tender specification;

ii)    an environmental briefing will be given to the staff employed by the contractor before departure to Antarctica;

iii)   construction work will be prohibited outside the areas already disturbed by station activities.

It will be the responsibility of the BAS Supervising Officer (Project Manager) to ensure that the contractor complies with Antarctic Treaty legislation, the tender specification and on-site procedures.

The most important mitigation measure recommended for the future operation of Rothera research station is the production of a station management and maintenance plan to direct planning decisions and to ensure all facilities are maintained to appropriate standards.

An investigation into the installation of a containerised, biological sewage treatment plant is advised.

7. Environmental monitoring and management

A long-term environmental monitoring programme has been in place at Rothera since 1975/76. Monitoring will continue during and after the expansion.

The environmental management of the expansion will be put under close scrutiny by the BAS. The BAS Environmental Officer will carry out an environmental inspection of the expansion during the 1995/96 season. The BAS will coordinate an environmental audit of Rothera research station within five years of the completion of the project.

8. Conclusion

This Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) indicates that the expansion of Rothera research station is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, provided the mitigation measures advised are carried out. It is therefore considered that a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) need not be prepared.

1. INTRODUCTION

This document is a Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) carried out by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) for the expansion of Rothera research station, Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, Antarctica. It has been prepared in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY

2.1 Purpose

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a component research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), is undertaking a restructuring of its facilities in Antarctica. As part of the restructuring programme, the BAS proposes that Rothera research station should be expanded so that new facilities can be made available for biological research.

The aim of the expansion is to:

i)      increase the efficiency of the BAS operations;
ii)     provide new opportunities for inshore marine and terrestrial biological research in the high latitudes of Antarctica;
iii)    increase the cooperation between the BAS and UK Higher Education Institutions;
iv)     facilitate international collaboration.

By 1997/98, Rothera research station, currently operating as the hub for the BAS geoscience, glaciological, and remote sensing programmes, will also become the centre for the BAS terrestrial and inshore marine biology programmes in Antarctica.

The new facilities will increase the accommodation and scientific capacity available at Rothera and enable the BAS to cope with the heavy demand for places on the station. This will allow more short-term visitors to work at Rothera and in deep-field locations, particularly senior scientists from the BAS, universities and other institutions whose workload precludes them from spending long periods overseas.

2.2 Location

The proposed expansion will be at Rothera research station (67° 34'S, 68° 08'W) on Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 1 and Plate 1).

2.2.1 Rothera research station and associated facilities

In 1974/75 Rothera Point was chosen as the location for a new major British research station in Antarctica. Following a biological site survey (Fenton, 1976) building began and Rothera research station was officially opened on 1st February 1976. Since then the station has been progressively expanded and is now the largest currently operated by the BAS

with accommodation for a maximum of 76 people. The average summer population is 40
people, and in winter 15 people.

In order to improve the operational support and safety of BAS field scientists, an air
facility was constructed at Rothera Point during 1989/90 and 1990/91. It consists of a
900 m long, crushed rock airstrip with parking area, hangar and fuel storage tanks. A
deep-water wharf for vessels was also constructed at the same time to enable easier
resupply of cargo and fuel, and removal of waste. The Rothera air facility and wharf were
built after the BAS undertook a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) of the
potential impact of the activity on the Antarctic environment (NERC, 1989).

At present, Rothera research station is the centre for studies in Earth, Ice and Climate
Sciences carried out by the BAS in Antarctica. The majority of the research is carried out
by small mobile field parties operating at remote locations often far from Rothera.

The BAS operates a fleet of four ski-wheeled de Havilland Twin Otter aircraft (DHC-6)
and a four-engined de Havilland Dash-7 (DHC-7) in Antarctica between November and
March each year to support scientific research and associated logistical activities. The
Twin Otters are used to ferry field parties from Rothera throughout the Antarctic
Peninsula, Ellsworth Land and farther south. The main task of the Dash-7 is to transport
personnel and light cargo directly from the Falkland Islands to Rothera.

2.3 Reasons for choosing Rothera research station as the location for the expansion
reasons:

i) Limited increased funding by government

The limited increased funding made available by government to the BAS to
complete its restructuring of facilities in the Antarctic was insufficient to rebuild
Signy research station (60° 43'S, 45° 36'W), Signy Island, South Orkney Islands as
had originally been planned. Given the need to increase efficiency and reduce costs,
the BAS decided that the only viable option (see Section 3) was to move terrestrial
and inshore marine biological research to Rothera research station.

ii) New infrastructure at Rothera

Rothera already has an air facility and deep-water wharf, and so can offer logistical
support which is unmatched by any other station in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

iii) Intercontinental air connection between Rothera and the Falkland Islands

The establishment in the 1993/94 austral summer of air links to Rothera from the
Falkland Islands using the BAS Dash-7 aircraft now allows for fast, frequent and
efficient transfer of personnel and light cargo.

2.4 Principal characteristics of the proposed expansion

The proposed expansion at Rothera (BAS, 1994) will involve the construction of the following buildings:

i)    Biological laboratory, aquarium and diving facility

The building will comprise terrestrial and marine sciences laboratories, a seawater aquarium, and SCUBA diving facility with emergency recompression chamber.

ii)   Accommodation building

The building will provide accommodation during the austral summer for 48 people. It will contain twelve, four person bunkrooms, washrooms, laundry facilities and storage. The building will be closed and sealed each winter.

iii)  Boathouse

The building will house a rigid-hull inflatable boat (5.5 m length) and two smaller rigid-hull inflatable boats. The boats will be lowered into and raised out of the sea from the wharf using a small mobile crane.

iv)   Powerhouse

The building will contain three diesel generators (producing up to 450 kVA each) and associated plant, fuel tanks and control equipment. Only one generator will be in use at any one time.

v)    Building for reverse osmosis plant and tanks

The building will be attached to the main living complex by a link corridor and will contain a reverse osmosis plant for fresh water production and associated pumps, valves, pipework and tanks. Maximum fresh water production will be 16.0 m^(3)/24 hrs gross.

Alterations will be carried out to the following existing buildings and services;

i)    refit of the existing powerhouse as a combined laboratory and workshop with mezzanine;

ii)   refit of the existing computer room and mapping room as a computer facility;

iii)  rerouting of fuel and water pipelines.

Figure 2 shows Rothera research station and associated facilities, and the proposed locations of the new buildings. Table 1 gives the area of each new building (m^(2)) and of the area likely to be disturbed by construction activity around each building (m^(2)). The total area that is likely to be disturbed by building and construction activity will be 6600 m^(2).

2.4.1 Building and service specifications

The new buildings, with the exception of the boathouse and powerhouse, will be single storey and constructed using timber panels with a solid foam core. They will be supported on either solid concrete slabs (raft foundations), concrete piers or suspended concrete slabs on dwarf walls. The exteriors will be plastic coated steel, bonded to the timber panels. The boathouse will be an arched metal building ("miracle span") and the powerhouse a proprietary insulated building.

Services will be contained in timber ducts with heat-tracing and raised above the ground on wooden bearers attached to timber trestles. The existing surface fuel pipelines running parallel with the airstrip will be rerouted to provide space for the new biological laboratory.

The contractor will build and operate a construction camp on Rothera Point during the expansion. Prefabricated temporary buildings will be erected on the site of the former sledge dog spans on North Beach (see Figure 2). The camp will consist of an accommodation block, and a kitchen block with lounge and office. A diesel generator and reverse osmosis water production plant will be housed in containers. A further four containers will be used for storage. Table 2 gives the dimensions of each of the contractor's buildings and containers. The total area which is likely to be disturbed by building and construction of the camp will be approximately 1800 m2.

2.5 Duration

Site preparation, foundation and construction work will take place during the 1994/95 austral summer, with final fitting-out planned for the 1995/96 austral summer. The buildings, once constructed, will have a design life-span of twenty years.

2.6 Intensity

Construction work will be undertaken by a contractor operating to the instructions of the BAS. All of the contractor's personnel, plant and materials will be transported to Rothera by either BAS vessels or aircraft. A maximum of 40 contractors will be on site at Rothera at any one time for a maximum of 117 days during both the 1994/95 and 1995/96 seasons. Estimates for 1994/95 and 1995/96 of the volume of cargo that will be imported to Rothera for the expansion are 1800 m3 and 1000 m3 respectively.

By 1997/98 the expansion of Rothera station will be complete with marine and terrestrial sciences fully operational. The station will then be able to accommodate a maximum of 124 people. However, it is unlikely that the full operating level of 120 people will be reached for some years and then will only stay at this level for short periods (2-3 weeks) at the beginning and end of each summer field season when research parties are preparing for and returning from the field. The average occupancy of the station during the summer is likely to be approximately 60-70 people. In winter the station will have a complement of up to 30 people to undertake long-term, all year scientific research and provide logistical support. The increase in the number of wintering personnel above present levels is because of the introduction of marine and terrestrial scientists to the station.

3. ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSAL

3.1 Rebuild of Signy research station

Currently the majority of BAS terrestrial and marine biological research in the Antarctic is carried out at Signy research station. However, the station is now outmoded, with the main living and science block dating from 1963/64, and becoming increasingly difficult to operate and maintain. It also does not meet modern requirements for health and safety.

The BAS had originally planned to completely rebuild and expand Signy research station and carried out an IEE for this proposed activity (BAS, 1990). However, the extra funding from government required for the rebuild was not made available, nor were there sufficient resources for the station to be renovated at its current capacity and comply with new health and safety requirements. The BAS has therefore decided that the existing station should be closed and mothballed by 1996/97 as part of the restructuring programme. Unwanted buildings will be removed by the BAS from Antarctica as resources and logistics permit. The BAS proposes to develop a new small, summer-only station on Signy, primarily to support freshwater biological research.

3.2 Use of existing station facilities in the Antarctic Peninsula region

Apart from Signy, the only other existing station in the Antarctic Peninsula region which carries out a large-scale, year round biological research programme is Palmer research station (USA) (64° 46’S, 64° 03’W), Arthur Harbour, Anvers Island. However, spare summer accommodation is not available at Palmer so this alternative was dismissed.

3.3 Do nothing and attempt to use the existing facilities at Rothera Point

The existing facilities at Rothera are already operating at full capacity and cannot be adapted or updated. The existing station complex at Rothera dates from 1986/87, and provides only rudimentary laboratories for the BAS geoscience and glaciological field research programmes.

The BAS terrestrial and nearshore marine biology programmes require high specification chemical and radioisotope laboratories, controlled temperature experimental rooms and a research aquarium. Sub-aqua diving will require a purpose built dive facility with recompression chamber. Such facilities do not currently exist at Rothera.

The BAS concluded that the only practical and viable option was to build new facilities for terrestrial and biological research at Rothera research station.

4. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT

4.1 Topography and hydrography

Rothera Point is a low rocky promontory, at the southern extremity of the Wormald Ice Piedmont, south-eastern Adelaide Island. The promontory covers an area of approximately 
—11—
439,700 m2 and rises to a maximum height above sea level of 39 m.

The isthmus between the Wormald Ice Piedmont and Rothera Point was originally a raised beach composed of small stones and pebbles. This beach was destroyed during the construction of the airstrip. Rothera Point itself comprises a dissected rock ridge, running north-east to south-west, an area of raised beach on the south-eastern side composed of rounded boulders, and an area of permanent ice at the southern end. The total ice free area of Rothera Point is 368,700 m2, and the area covered by permanent ice and snow is 80,000 m2. Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) No. 9 is situated on the north-eastern corner of the point. This site was specifically designated to monitor the impact of station activities on the Antarctic fellfield ecosystem (see Appendix 1). The site itself has little intrinsic nature conservation value.

A sloping ice-ramp with a gradient of about 1:5 leads from the isthmus to the Wormald Ice Piedmont. In recent years the ice-ramp has deteriorated due to melting because of a general rise in air temperature in the Antarctic Peninsula region, and also ablation due to dust deposition from construction and logistical activities on Rothera Point.

There are three main bodies of freshwater and transient melt water pools covering an area of 800 m2. The largest pool is at the southern end of Rothera Point and is about 560 m2 in area and up to 4.5 m deep. Smaller pools are found on the far western side of the point, beside the hangar and also at the northern end of East Beach. There are no streams, but temporary melt-water runnels flow from snow patches for a short period in the summer.

4.2 Geology and soils

The rocks are predominately heterogeneous intrusions of diorite, granodiorite and, to the north of the isthmus, adamellite, of the mid-Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary Andean Intrusive Suite.

The surface of the airstrip consists of crushed, local rock and gravel.

Soil is restricted to small pockets of glacial till and sand on the rock bluffs. Local deeper deposits produce scattered small circles and polygons of frost sorted material. There are no extensive areas of patterned ground. Fragments of bone and egg shell in the soil provide evidence of ancient penguin, probably Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), colonies on Rothera Point. Around prominent rock outcrops used as bird perches by Dominican gulls (Larus dominicanus) there are accumulations of recent and decaying limpet (Nacella concinna) shells forming patches of calcareous soil. Some of these patches are up to 10 m2 in area and 35 cm deep.

There are no accumulations of organic matter, except for a very shallow layer of decaying moss peat (c. 2 cm deep) beneath patches of moss.

There are no special or unique geological or geomorphological features at Rothera Point.

There are a wide range of intertidal and subtidal substrata at Rothera including vertical bedrock faces, boulder and cobble beaches and slopes and flat beds of soft silt.

−12−
The seabed around Rothera Point shelves steeply and depths in excess of 500 m can be 
found only 5 km from the base. Waters less than 200 m deep are restricted to the 
immediate fringe of the coastline. Currents around the coastline are minimal, with only the 
channel between Rothera Point and Killingbeck Island, and the eastern side of Killingbeck 
Island having current speeds in excess of 0.5 kts.

4.3 Meteorology and oceanography

The climate at Rothera Point is relatively cold and dry and represents the transition from 
the more oceanically influenced "maritime" Antarctic to the north and the more extreme 
climate of "continental" Antarctica to the south.

The mean air temperatures in summer are in the region −2°C to +1°C whilst in winter they 
range between −5°C and -20°C.

The mean wind speed is 13.4 kts. Gale force winds are expected on over 60 days per year. 
An extreme gust of 80 kts has been recorded. The prevailing wind direction is from the 
north-east. The strongest winds generally come from this direction or the north-north-west.

Rothera has no direct sunlight for a few weeks at mid-winter (June) and has 24 hours of 
sunlight possible for a similar period at mid-summer (December).

Despite the proximity of Rothera Point to deep oceanic water, seawater temperatures can 
vary considerably. Data have shown a 3°C change in sea surface temperature over a period 
of just three days during the austral summer (Coggan, 1994). Seawater temperatures 
generally range between -1.5°C in winter to 2.0°C in summer.

Sea ice conditions vary greatly through the year and from year to year. The waters around 
Rothera Point can remain totally locked with fast ice from July to February one year but 
be completely free of fast ice in another. Pack ice often drifts north from Marguerite Bay 
when the wind is in the south or during calm periods and can rapidly fill South Bay.

4.4 Biology

4.4.1 Terrestrial biology

The limited terrestrial biological interest at Rothera Point is associated with the rock bluffs 
where there is sparse plant growth. The scarcity of plants is because of the relatively 
recent emergence of the promontory from snow and ice. The vegetation is representative 
of the southern "maritime" Antarctic fellfield ecosystem and is dominated by the fruticose 
and foliose lichens Usnea antarctica and U. sphacelata, Umbilicaria decussata, 
Pseudephebe minuscula and P. pubescens. There are also numerous crustose lichens 
associated.

−13−
The construction of the airstrip led to the direct destruction of lichens in areas where rock was quarried or spread, or vehicles were used. There are now no plants surviving in the area of the airstrip or station buildings. None of the lichen species recorded at Rothera Point were restricted to these impacted areas.

Mosses, mostly Andreaea spp., are very sparse. There are two small stands (one 30 m^(2) in area and the other 20 m^(2) in area) of the moss Drepanocladus uncinatus in moist hollows. Mosses were not affected by the construction of the airstrip.

Vascular plants are absent, except for a single plant of Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) on the summit of the SSSI.

The visible invertebrate fauna consists of a few different species of mites and springtails, of which Cryptopygus antarcticus and Halozetes belgicae are the most common. The fairy shrimp Branchinecta gainii is abundant in the pool at the south-west end of the rock bluffs. Nematodes and rotifers have also been recorded in freshwater pools (NERC, 1989).

The terrestrial biota of Rothera Point is very restricted in species diversity and abundance in relation to other nearby ice-free areas in northern Marguerite Bay. For example, Anchorage, Lagoon and Léonie islands (Figure 3) all have a relatively diverse cryptogamic flora and vegetation with an abundance of the grass Deschampsia antarctica.

There are no unique or rare terrestrial flora and fauna on Rothera Point.

4.4.2 Nearshore marine biology

The intertidal zone is subject to ice scour and as such is virtually devoid of life. However, rocky shores and large boulders do support seasonal growth of filamentous green algae which is exploited by mobile animals such as the Antarctic limpet (Nacella concinna).

The sub-tidal zone from 0.5 m depth is colonised by encrusting algae (Lithothamnion spp.) in most areas. Macroalgae are sparse except in the shallow waters around Killingbeck Island where there is some protection from ice scour and stands of Desmarestia menziesii are common. Large encrusting and erect sponges occur to the north east of Rothera Point. The most common animals found are extensive mats of terrebellid tube-building worms and holothurian sea cucumbers which support a variety of invertebrate taxa. Hard rock substrata protected from ice scour, such as the vertical rock faces at the south of Rothera Point, support an enormous biomass and diversity of organisms. Suspension feeders, such as sponges, hydroids, soft corals, bryozoans, and brachiopods are all very common.

The subtidal faunal cover in North Bay is impoverished (Coggan, 1994). The most likely reason for this is icebergs grounding into the soft bottom sediment. White necrotic patches of sediment (each approximately 20 m^(2) in area) in the middle of North Bay contain dead animals, such as amphipods, echinoderms and asteroids. Research studies by the BAS at Signy Island have found similar patches and shown that they are caused by sediments being ploughed by icebergs (Peck, personal communication, 1994). Sewage pollution is not, therefore, likely to be the cause of the impoverished faunal cover in North Bay. Pollution from the outfall appears very localised, with visible waste matter only being recorded within 25 m of the sewage outfall pipe (Coggan, 1994).

The construction of the air facility required rock infilling into the sea at both ends of the airstrip and this led to smothering of small areas of the shallow littoral and sublittoral. Sub-aqua diving surveys have shown that damage to marine life has been minimal and the rock boulders are already showing evidence of colonisation (Coggan, 1994).

On the present limited evidence (Coggan, 1994), the littoral and sublittoral zones around Rothera Point appear to be representative of the communities found elsewhere in Ryder Bay.

4.4.3 Birds and mammals

Skuas (Catharacta spp.) are the most abundant breeding and non-breeding birds found at Rothera Point. The brown skua (C. lonnbergii) and south polar skua (C. maccormicki) breed as do mixed pairs. Two pairs of Dominican gulls (Larus dominicanus) also nest on Rothera Point.

Monitoring of breeding birds on Rothera Point has been carried out since 1975/76. The number of breeding skuas is fairly constant, with a minimum of 8 pairs in 1977/78 and a maximum of 15 pairs in 1989/90 and 1992/93 (Figure 4). Skua population stability is very evident (Croxall, personal communication, 1994). There was a slight decrease in breeding pairs between 1990/91 and 1991/92, possibly due to the loss of four breeding nests on the raised beach next to the ice cliffs during initial site clearance work for the airstrip in 1989/90, but the population had fully recovered by 1992/93.

The breeding success of the skuas has varied (Figure 4). In 1977/78, 4 chicks hatched, increasing to 22 chicks in 1989/90, but only 7 chicks hatched in 1992/93 (Morton and Hodges, 1994). The fluctuations in breeding success are very typical of the species in the area (Croxall, personal communication, 1994) and may be due to either natural factors or human activities. Skuas often suffer very high natural egg and chick mortalities due to shortages of prey, or bad weather, particularly storms. Human activities may have increased breeding success up to 1988/89 by providing extra food, either from station food scraps or from seal meat which was used to feed the sledge dogs. The initial site surveying for the airstrip in 1989/90 resulted in the accidental death of six skua chicks. Since 1990/91 breeding success has remained low, possibly because scavenging for food by skuas at the station has been greatly reduced by the introduction of new waste disposal procedures and the reduction in number and final removal of the sledge dogs in 1993/94.

Since 1989/90 no further chicks have died and no further nests have been destroyed by scientific or logistical operations. Indeed, in 1993/94 one breeding pair returned to an abandoned nest site adjacent to the northern end of the runway (Morton and Hodges, 1994).

Figure 5a shows the nest sites of breeding birds in 1975/76 and Figure 5b the nest sites in 1993/94. These diagrams show that breeding skuas have remained faithful to their nest sites, and continued to use them despite the increase in human activity at Rothera Point during the last 18 years.

Large numbers of non-breeding skuas (between 150 - 200 birds) congregate in communal areas, often near shallow melt pools. In 1993/94, there were communal areas beside the melt pools on East Beach and at either end of the runway.

A few Wilson's storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) and Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata) have been recorded flying overhead, but it is not known if any pairs breed on Rothera Point. Killingbeck and Lagoon islands support nesting colonies of Antarctic terns (Sterna vittata), and adjacent rock outcrops have small nesting colonies of blue-eyed shags (Phalacrocorax atriceps). Overflying snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) and southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) have been seen occasionally.

There are no penguin colonies on Rothera Point. Small numbers of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) do occasionally come ashore. Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) are rare visitors.

Rothera Point has no seal breeding sites, although small numbers of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) with pups have been seen occasionally in winter, on the northern side of the point. Both Weddell and crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) are common on ice floes in North Bay and South Bay during summer, and small numbers of Weddell seals haul out on all of the beaches around the point. Elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) have been recorded at Rothera Point and at Léonie and Killingbeck islands, and are common on the beaches of Jenny Island where they moult annually. Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are rare. Fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) are also uncommon, although the numbers have increased in recent years.

Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are common in Ryder Bay during the late austral summer, and often pass very close to the south-western end of Rothera Point. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are also frequently seen. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are rare but have been observed taking seals in Ryder Bay.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF IMPACTS

5.1 Data and methods

Impact matrices have been used to identify the scale of the predicted impacts of the expansion. The matrices were produced by analysing a list of the activities associated with the expansion against a list of environmental parameters. Impacts that were considered to be highly unlikely were not considered in the matrices.

Each identified environmental impact has been subdivided into one of four categories: nil or negligible; low; medium; and high. Criteria for assessing the level of impact are shown in Table 3.

The rankings of the different categories of impact in the matrices are based on value judgements. These judgements were based on current scientific and technical knowledge, and where possible, only made after examining the results of the environmental monitoring programme already established at Rothera (see Section 7.1).

Two impact matrices were produced:

i)   Matrix 1 shows the impacts associated with construction activities (Table 4);

ii)  Matrix 2 shows the impacts associated with the operation of the station after the expansion has been completed (Table 5).

5.2 Impact of construction activities (Table 4)

5.2.1 Terrestrial impacts

The expansion will be compact and contained within a small area since much of Rothera 
Point is unsuitable for construction work, due either to steep rocky bluffs and permanent 
ice, or because the ground is protected as SSSI No. 9 (Appendix 1).

A direct terrestrial impact will be the disturbance of gravel due to site preparation work. 
The total area likely to be affected by construction activities will be approximately 
10,000 m^(2). However, disturbance will be limited to the immediate vicinity of the planned 
building sites. These sites are located within areas of levelled, prepared ground produced 
during the construction of the airstrip and wharf. The total artificially levelled area already 
impacted at Rothera Point is 151,300 m^(2).

Most rock dust will fallout within 10 m of the construction sites, although small amounts 
could discolour rocks up to 100 m downwind. There are no plants growing in or 
immediately adjacent to the main development areas, but there are plants, mostly lichens, 
growing on the rock bluffs 80 m away. Cement dust is highly alkaline (pH 11) and could 
cause physiological damage to lichens on Rothera Point, especially Umbilicaria decussata, 
Usnea antarctica and U. sphacelata. Heavy contamination of lichens by concrete dust, 
which could cause the bleaching and easy detachment of plants, is very unlikely as all 
concrete mixing sites will be on areas of bare ground created during the airstrip 
construction and are away from the rock bluffs. Dust could pollute freshwater pools.

Breeding skuas and Dominican gulls are unlikely to be disturbed either by noise or by 
physical disturbance. All the nests except one are located on the rock bluffs, at least 100 m 
away from the building sites. Disturbance to seals will be minimal as very few are 
normally found hauled out around Rothera Point.

The increase in materials and personnel at Rothera during the construction phase will 
increase the risk of the accidental introduction of non-native biota, particularly micro-
organisms.

5.2.2 Marine impacts

There will be a direct marine impact on seawater chemistry because of pollution by 
sewage and grey water from the operation of the construction camp at North Beach. 
Although sewage and wet food waste will be macerated before disposal into the sea, the 
effluent will add nutrients, heavy metals, organic pollutants, suspended sediments, and 
solids at, and in the immediate locality of, the sewage outfall in North Bay. The volume of 
effluent from the camp will, however, be small in comparison to that already being 
produced by the research station. The effluent will probably not be detectable more than 
100 m from the outfall.

5.2.3 Atmospheric, glacier ice and snow impacts

Construction activities will result in air pollution from vehicle emissions and airborne dust 
from earth moving, concrete batching and site preparation.

The combustion of fossil fuels will produce carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter. Gases will be 
quickly dispersed and will not add significantly to background levels after mixing.

The main constituents of concrete dust are silicon dioxide, calcium silicates, calcium 
aluminates and calcium sulphates. It also contains small amounts of alkali and plasticiser.

The majority of exhaust emissions, concrete and rock dust will be carried out into Ryder 
Bay by the prevailing north-easterly winds and only large heavy particles of soot or dust 
are likely to fallout on Rothera Point. Atmospheric effects are likely to be local and 
transient. Dust fallout can be expected on glacier ice, the ice-ramp and snow drifts 
downwind of earth moving, concrete batching and site preparation activities. This will 
cause increased melting, and so lead to minor changes in the local, seasonal meltwater 
drainage pattern.

In winter, snowdrifts will form downwind of the building depots, construction camp and 
new buildings.

5.2.4 Human values

A direct impact of the construction activities at Rothera Point will be on BAS logistics. 
The BAS will use its own vessels and aircraft to transport the contractor's cargo, personnel 
and waste. However, this will mean that the contractor will not have to use his own ships 
and aircraft to reach Rothera so minimising transport required and reducing the wider 
environmental impact of the expansion.

The construction depots, the construction camp and the sites for the new buildings will be confined to the existing station and airstrip area. There will be no more than a minor and local impact on wilderness value.

5.3 Impacts of operation (Table 5)

The operation of Rothera research station after the expansion is predicted to give rise to both direct and cumulative impacts.

5.3.1 Terrestrial impacts

A direct impact on terrestrial habitats will result from the terrestrial biological research focused on the flora and invertebrates found on islands near to Rothera Point and at ice-free areas on Alexander Island. Minor localised damage only is expected to result from this activity.

The majority of the terrestrial biology fieldwork will be carried out on Anchorage, Lagoon and Léonie islands. Fieldwork is likely to concentrate initially on Lagoon Island as it is within easy reach of Rothera and has a small refuge hut. Other terrestrial biology studies will be carried out by small tented field parties operating much further afield from Rothera in ice-free areas on Alexander Island. Research will concentrate initially on deglaciated areas at Two Step Moraine (71° 53’ S, 68° 20’W), Mars Glacier, Alexander Island.

Terrestrial biological research will cause the formation of footpaths along frequently used routes to field sites, very localised damage from some scientific experiments and local sewage pollution from the small hut on Lagoon Island and at tented field camps elsewhere. Further refuge huts may be built at other study sites for safety and emergency purposes. Biological research will not, however, significantly damage a concentration of native plants, or cause significant damage to the habitat of any native mammal, bird, or plant.

The increased number of personnel and volume of materials at Rothera after the completion of the expansion will increase the risk of accidentally introducing non-native biota. In addition, both terrestrial and inshore marine biological research programmes at Rothera may require the deliberate introduction of non-native biota under special permit for use in carefully controlled scientific experiments.

5.3.2 Marine impacts

A direct marine impact from the operation of the expansion will be on seawater chemistry because of pollution from the station and laboratory waste outfall discharging into North Bay. The effluent will include sewage, grey water, wet domestic waste, waste fresh water and sea water. To cater for the increased number of personnel on the station at peak periods, fresh water production is planned to increase from a maximum of 7.4 m^(3)/24 hrs gross in 1993/94 to a maximum of 16.0 m^(3)/24 hrs gross in 1996/97. The maximum volume of effluent discharged per day at peak periods will therefore be more than double present maximum levels. This will result in elevated levels of nutrients, heavy metals, organic residues, suspended sediments and solids at, and in the immediate locality of, the sewage outfall. It is considered unlikely that the effluent would be detectable more than 200 m away from the outfall.

Marine impacts due to inshore marine biological research are not likely, as sampling is 
carefully controlled by BAS scientists to prevent local depletion of marine biota. 
Monitoring undertaken by the BAS at Signy Island has failed to demonstrate long-term 
changes related specifically to marine biological research (Peck, personal communication, 
1994).

5.3.3 Atmospheric, glacier ice and snow impacts

The expansion of the station will require an increase in power generation. In 1993/94 the 
average power generation capacity was 200 kVA, by 1996/97 the average could be up to 
400 kVA. Increased air pollution will result from the increase in power generation. 
Emissions will include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, sulphur dioxide, 
heavy metals and particulates.

Emissions from diesel generators, vehicles and aircraft will be rapidly and thoroughly 
dispersed by the strong and regular winds, with the majority being carried out into Ryder 
Bay. There will be some fallout of pollutants in the local area. Heavy larger particles, such 
as soot, are likely to have relatively short maximum transport distances, with background 
levels in surface snow samples probably being reached within 2 km upwind of the station. 
Heavy metals would have greater transport distances. Based on monitoring results from 
Halley IV research station (75° 36'S, 26° 41'W), Brunt Ice Shelf, Coats Land (Suttie and 
Wolff, 1993), it is likely that background levels of heavy metals in surface snow samples 
would probably be reached at a maximum of 10 km upwind of Rothera research station.

5.3.4 Human values

The operation of the expansion will be carried out without an increase in flying hours of 
the BAS aircraft. Flying hours have been pegged at approximately 1900 hrs since 1992/93 
for reasons of costs. There will therefore be more competition from the BAS research 
programmes for existing static resources.

Scientific research at Rothera will be greatly enhanced by the expansion. The new 
biological facilities will enable year-round, long-term terrestrial and inshore marine 
biological programmes to be carried out at Rothera for the first time.

The new buildings constructed as part of the expansion will be confined to areas already 
levelled during the airstrip development. All the buildings, with the exception of the 
boathouse and powerhouse, will be single storey and will have only a minor visual impact. 
The expansion will have no more than a minor and local impact on wilderness values.

5.4 Cumulative impacts in the light of existing and known planned activities

5.4.1 Increase in the number of personnel at Rothera during the austral summer and winter

The expansion will lead to increased human activity at Rothera research station and in the 
nearby area both in summer and winter (see Section 2.7) and this will have a cumulative 
impact. An important result of the increase in the numbers will be the production of 
increased quantities of waste.

-25-
It is the BAS policy that all waste from Rothera station, other than sewage or wet food waste, should be removed from Antarctica. Non-hazardous waste is taken to the Falkland Islands where it is disposed of safely by incineration or as landfill. Hazardous waste is returned to the UK for proper disposal. Where possible, wastes are recycled either in the Falkland Islands or UK (eg. redundant equipment and stores, drinks cans, wood, gas cylinders, refrigerants). Waste management procedures currently used at Rothera are outlined in the BAS Waste Management Handbook (Shears, 1993).

During 1993/94, Rothera research station produced a total volume of 287.8 m^(3) of non-hazardous waste, 13.0 m^(3) of waste fuels and lubricants and 1.8 m^(3) hazardous waste. The station population during the year was 15 in winter and an average of 40 in the summer. By 1997/98, when the new facilities are operational, the quantities of non-hazardous wastes and waste fuels and lubricants will probably increase by 20 - 30% compared to present levels. However, the quantity of hazardous waste produced will be much higher than at present, probably double, because of the introduction of biological research.

5.4.2 Addition of small facilities

A cumulative impact will be the addition of small facilities to enhance the scientific or logistical activities carried out at Rothera research station. For example, the probable construction of further aerial arrays, small buildings and storage sheds on Rothera Point, and the possible construction of refuge huts on Léonie and Anchorage islands and in ice-free areas of Alexander Island for safety and emergency purposes. On their own such small-scale developments may be of little consequence but together they could lead to a slow and incremental degradation of Rothera Point and the local area.

5.4.3 The effects of air pollution from exhaust emissions on terrestrial flora

There will be a cumulative impact on terrestrial flora from air pollution due to exhaust emissions on Rothera Point and northern Marguerite Bay.

Monitoring of heavy metals (zinc, lead, cadmium, aluminium and manganese) and sulphur in the lichen Usnea sphacelata has been carried out at Rothera Point since 1976. Figure 6 shows results for zinc, lead and sulphur from selected sampling sites between 1976 and 1992. The highest heavy metal levels are generally found near to the station, particularly for zinc. Although, levels quickly decline with distance away from the station, the area contaminated has increased as the facility has developed. For example in the case of lead, background levels were reached 200 m away from the station in 1978, by 1989 this had increased to 400 m, and by 1992 all of Rothera Point was contaminated to some degree. The major sources of air pollution are the station diesel generators, with vehicles and aircraft also contributing. The biological effects of this pollution are expected to be minimal.

5.4.4 Minor fuel spills and leaks

A further, but localised, cumulative impact will be sediment contamination on Rothera
Point from minor fuel spills and leaks from vehicles, fuel tanks and pipelines. Marine
sediments may also be progressively contaminated by small spills, ship and boating
activities and land run-off.

Monitoring of hydrocarbon levels in terrestrial sediments at Rothera Point has been carried
out since 1990. Figure 7 shows that before construction of the airstrip began in 1990, six
of the twenty three sampling sites were found contaminated. The most severely polluted
area found was at sampling site S6, at the northern end of the airstrip (1500 μg g-1 of
diesel to dry soil). Up to 1990, this site had been used for burning waste fuel. In 1991, the
number of sampling sites found polluted increased to eleven. Contaminated soil was found
around the station and airstrip. Further monitoring was carried out in 1992, but only nine
sites were sampled due to frozen ground and snow. Both the 1991 and 1992 surveys
showed that the most heavily polluted area was at site S23 on the rock bluffs
(13,000 μg g-1 of diesel to dry soil in 1992). This was the location of the old station fuel
flubbers and sediments were contaminated by small spills during refuelling and by
leakages of diesel wax during the dismantling and removal of the flubbers in 1990. No
contamination of sediments has been found in the SSSI.

The results of the hydrocarbon monitoring suggest that fuel pollution is a direct result of
small local spills and leaks from vehicles, aircraft, fuel flubbers, pipelines, drums and
tanks rather than indirectly from contaminated meltwater or atmospheric fall-out of oil
droplets. The biological effects of minor fuel spills or leaks at Rothera Point are expected
to be minimal.

6. MINIMISING AND MITIGATING IMPACTS

6.1 Construction activities

6.1.1 Development planning

The BAS established a Rothera Development Working Group in 1993 with the overall
purpose of establishing a comprehensive Statement Of Requirement (SOR) for the new
facilities. The BAS Environmental Officer was a member of the Working Group and
ensured that the provisions of the Environmental Protocol, particularly as regards waste
disposal, were clearly incorporated into the SOR.

6.1.2 Tender specification

The tender specification for the expansion of Rothera included a section containing
environmental requirements supplied by the BAS Environmental Officer (Appendix 2).
The contractor has accepted all the environmental safeguards contained in the tender
specification, and will comply fully with the Environmental Protocol.

The BAS Supervising Officer (Project Manager) will have overall responsibility for
ensuring compliance by the contractor with Antarctic Treaty legislation, the tender
specification and on-site procedures.

6.1.3 Environmental education

In order to conform with the Environmental Protocol it is the BAS policy to brief all new 
recruits on environmental and waste management before they travel to Antarctica. This 
policy will be extended to the personnel employed by the contractor, and a briefing will be 
given by the BAS Environmental Officer to the workforce immediately prior to their 
departure to Antarctica. At the briefing, all personnel will be given a copy of the Antarctic 
Treaty Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic (ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1).

At Rothera, a further briefing on environmental and waste management on-site will be 
given by the Station Manager.

6.1.4 Prohibited areas

To minimise ground disturbance from construction activities (see Section 5.2.1) the 
contractor will be prohibited from working outside of areas already disturbed by station 
activities. All earth moving, trenching and site preparation work will be carried out within 
areas already artificially levelled during the building of the airstrip (see Figure 2).

6.1.5 Waste management

The contractor will comply with the BAS waste policy and will follow the procedures 
contained in the BAS Waste Management Handbook (see Section 5.4.1). In addition, the 
tender specification prohibits the contractor from importing in to Antarctica any of the 
banned products listed in Annex III of the Environmental Protocol, and also prohibits the 
open burning of waste (see Appendix 2). The contractor will pack waste from both 
construction and accommodation areas into suitable containers. The BAS will undertake 
the removal of the contractor’s waste from Rothera. Once the expansion is completed the 
contractor will undertake a full clean-up of the site.

6.1.6 Mitigating predicted impacts

Table 6 shows how the adverse impacts which may result from the construction activities 
(see Section 5.2) will be minimised or mitigated.

6.2 Operational activities

6.2.1 Station management and maintenance plan

A management and maintenance plan will be produced for Rothera research station and 
will include:

i)      a framework for the ordered future development and operation of Rothera research 
        station;
ii)     a schedule to ensure that all facilities and services are maintained to appropriate 
        standards;
iii)    guidance on making planning decisions on new scientific and building projects.

The Rothera station management and maintenance plan will be used to help minimise the 
impacts of scientific research programmes and associated logistical activities. The plan will 
include a presumption against the construction of new buildings outside of areas already 
impacted by station activities, except if they are needed for safety and emergency 
purposes. The preparation of the plan will begin in 1994 and will be the responsibility of 
the Rothera Management Working Group.

6.2.2 Seawater pollution

Mitigation measures will be taken to minimise seawater pollution (see Section 5.3.2). 
There will be primary treatment of sewage and domestic wastes by maceration, and all 
toilets will use salt water flushes to minimise the use of fresh water. Hazardous laboratory 
chemicals will be prevented from entering the sewage system and will be removed from 
Antarctica for safe disposal in the UK. The use of a containerised, biological sewage 
treatment plant at Rothera will be investigated during the 1994/95 season.

6.2.3 Air pollution

Monitoring has identified the station diesel generators as a major source of pollution 
fallout at Rothera. The practicality of filtering the emissions from the new generators will 
be examined during the 1994/95 season. To avoid increasing emissions the BAS has 
decided not to install an incinerator at Rothera to burn combustible waste.

6.2.4 Fuel spills

The BAS makes every effort to prevent accidental fuel spills through careful attention to 
fuel management and transfer operations, and by maintaining fuel tanks and pipelines to a 
high standard.

At Rothera comprehensive precautions are taken to ensure that fuel spills do not occur. 
They are:
    i)  the main fuel tank farm is fully bunded and valved off;
   ii)  the main fuel pipelines are blown through with compressed air on completion of 
        refuelling with only very small quantities left in low points.

During the expansion, further improvements will be taken to reduce the potential for spills:
    i)  the present flexible pipeline joints will be replaced with a safer alternative;
   ii)  the present metal pipeline supports will be replaced by concrete piers;
  iii)  the fuel tank to be built by the new powerhouse will be double skinned and will 
        have a full containment berm.

The risk of a major fuel spill occurring at Rothera research station is therefore very small, 
and the level of risk will not be increased by the expansion.

-32-
The BAS recognises that even with the best precautions accidents can still happen and oil 
spill contingency procedures are required. The BAS has therefore put in place the 
following response measures at Rothera:

i)      production of the Rothera Oil Spill Contingency Plan (Shears and Osborne, 1993);
ii)     on-site oil spill response equipment, materials and safety clothing;
iii)    training in oil spill response for the Base Commander.

Regular oil spill response exercises will be held at Rothera from the 1994/95 season.

6.2.5 Mitigating predicted impacts

Table 7 shows how the adverse impacts which may result from the operation of the station 
after the expansion has been completed (see Section 5.3) will be minimised or mitigated.

7. ASSESSMENT AND VERIFICATION OF IMPACTS

7.1 Environmental monitoring

An important aspect of the environmental management of Rothera research station is the 
scientific monitoring of key environmental indicators. The objective of the monitoring 
programme is to identify and provide early warning of any damage, and assess the actual 
environmental impact of station activities. Results from the monitoring programme have 
also been used in this IEE to help predict the impacts of the expansion (see Section 5).

The BAS considers that the environmental monitoring programme at Rothera has identified 
impacts and provided useful information. It will therefore continue during and after the 
expansion. The organisation of the programme is the responsibility of the BAS 
Environmental Officer.

The key indicators that are currently being monitored at Rothera Point are:

i)      heavy metal and sulphur accumulation in lichens;
ii)     hydrocarbon levels in gravel and soil;
iii)    distribution and numbers of breeding birds, particularly skuas;
iv)     sub-aqua survey of inshore marine biota and colonisation by biota of new substrata;

In addition, records are made of the following parameters:

i)      types and amounts of waste removed for disposal in the Falkland Islands or UK;
ii)     fuel spills and clean-up response.

Airborne dust was monitored during the 1989/90, 1990/91 and 1991/92 seasons during and 
after the construction of the airstrip. However, this produced very little useful data due to 
operational failures of the dust samplers, and problems with the accurate weighing of dust 
filter papers at Rothera. After taking expert, independent advice (Vallack, 1993), the 
monitoring of dust was stopped.

### 7.2 Environmental inspection and audit

The environmental management of the expansion will be put under close scrutiny by the BAS.

The BAS Environmental Officers visited Rothera Point in March 1994 to carry out a site survey before expansion began, and an ecological survey of Lagoon, Killingbeck, Anchorage and Leonie islands will be conducted by senior BAS biologists in 1994/95.

A site visit to Rothera will be made by the BAS Head of Terrestrial and Freshwater Life Sciences, who has overall responsibility for the BAS environmental management programme, in February 1995. The visit will include a review of the building work completed during the 1994/95 season.

A full environmental inspection of the expansion will be carried out by the BAS Environmental Officer during the 1995/96 season. The objective of the inspection will be to examine the project and verify its compliance with the Environmental Protocol, and mitigation measures recommended by this IEE. The BAS Environmental Officer will work with the BAS Supervising Officer (Project Manager) to ensure the contractor undertakes a full clean-up of the site upon completion of works.

−35−
An environmental audit of Rothera research station will be carried out by BAS within five years of the completion of the expansion. The objectives of the audit will be to examine whether:

i)      the predictions contained in this IEE and the airstrip CEE (NERC, 1989) were accurate;

ii)     if any unforeseen impacts occurred during the construction of the airstrip and expansion;

iii)    the mitigation measures and monitoring studies recommended in this IEE and the airstrip CEE were effective.

The audit will be coordinated by the BAS Environmental Officer.

8. CONCLUSION

This Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) indicates that the expansion of Rothera research station is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, provided the recommended mitigation measures are carried out. It is therefore considered that a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) need not be prepared.

APPENDIX 1

Management plan Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 9, Rothera Point, Adelaide Island

i) Description of site. Rothera Point (lat. 67° 34'S, long. 68° 08'W) is situated in Ryder Bay, at the south-east corner of Square Peninsula* on the east side of Adelaide Island, south-west Antarctic Peninsula. The proposed Site is the north-eastern one-third of the point and is representative of the area as a whole. The British station Rothera lies about 350 m west of the western boundary of the Site.

ii) Reason for designation. This Site serves to monitor the impact of man on an Antarctic fellfield ecosystem. The vegetation is not rich or well developed, and the soils are shallow and confined to small pockets; there is no significant avifauna. Some monitoring studies have been in progress since before the establishment of the research station in 1975.

iii) Outline of research. Investigations incorporating the monitoring of terrestrial and freshwater macro- and micro-biota, soils and heavy metal deposition within the Site (control area) and near the Site (impact area) will continue with a view to assessing the impact of the neighbouring research station.

iv) Date of expiry of designation. 31 December 1995.

v) Access points. None designated.

vi) Pedestrian and vehicular routes. Vehicles and helicopters are excluded. Pedestrians should enter the Site only in connection with monitoring activities. Pedestrian access is allowed to the beaches seaward of the Site.

vii) Other kinds of scientific investigations which would not cause harmful interference. Investigation that would not affect the effectiveness of the Site for the purpose for which it has been designated.

viii) Scientific sampling. This should be restricted to the minimum required in connection with the monitoring programme.

ix) Other restraints. Sledge dogs associated with the research programmes at Rothera station must not be permitted to enter the Site+. Human wastes must not be deposited in the Site.

Notes:
* Official place name is now Wright Peninsula.
+ Sledge dogs were removed from Rothera at the end of the 1993/94 season.

APPENDIX 2

Environmental requirements included in the tender specification for the Rothera
expansion

1. Environmental legislation and guidelines to be followed

The Contractor and all employees shall be aware of and shall comply with:

i)      The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and its Annexes
        dealing with:
        -       Environmental Impact Assessment;
        -       Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;
        -       Waste Disposal and Waste Management;
        -       Prevention of Marine Pollution;
        -       Area Protection and Management.

ii)     Guidelines prepared to protect the Antarctic environment:
        -       Antarctic Treaty Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic;
        -       BAS Waste Management Handbook;
        -       Rothera Oil Spill Contingency Plan;
        -       Procedures which may be established by the Environmental Officer or
                Station Commander to minimize or mitigate environmental impacts related
                to the activity.

2. Environmental Impact Assessment

The Contractor must ensure that the project is planned and conducted so as to limit
adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment.

3. Protection of Antarctic fauna and flora

The Contractor must not disturb, harass or interfere with wildlife, or allow plants to be
damaged or destroyed. Firearms and weapons are prohibited and no hunting, trapping or
killing of birds or animals is permitted. The Contractor must not introduce plants or
animals to Antarctica. All equipment and plant must be cleaned, preferably by steam-
cleaning, by the Contractor before despatch to Antarctica.

4. Waste disposal and management

The Contractor is to ensure that none of the following products, listed in Annex III of the
Protocol, are imported to the Antarctic:
        -       Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);
        -       Non-sterile soil;
        -       Polystyrene beads, chips or similar forms of man-made packaging;
        -       Pesticides.

−40−
The use of PVC products, especially plastic PVC packaging, should be avoided.

It is BAS policy that all waste from Rothera station, other than sewage or domestic waste, 
should be removed from Antarctica. The Contractor must comply with the waste 
management procedures developed at Rothera which are described in the BAS Waste 
Management Handbook.

The Contractor is required to sort, pack and label wastes produced by the project. The 
BAS will undertake the removal of the Contractor's waste from Antarctica. Disposal costs 
for this waste will be passed onto the Contractor. The Contractor will be expected to help 
in the loading of waste at Rothera. The Contractor is to ensure work areas at Rothera are 
kept tidy and free of loose rubbish at all times. The burning of waste by the Contractor is 
prohibited.

●	The Contractor is to ensure that there is a final clean-up of the site upon completion of 
works. The clean-up must be completed to the satisfaction of the BAS Environmental 
Officer.

5. The prevention of pollution

The Contractor is prohibited from intentionally discharging fuel or hazardous chemicals 
into the Antarctic environment, unless the safety of personnel, ships, aircraft or equipment 
and facilities of high value are at risk.

The Contractor must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that fuel is not spilled 
during the project. Should the Contractor cause a spill of fuel or other hazardous chemical, 
the Contractor is required, if at all practical, to stop further spillage and carry out an 
immediate clean-up. Personnel must be adequately trained to deal with such emergencies. 
The BAS must be informed of the incident as soon as possible. Any clean-up must be 
completed to the satisfaction of the BAS Environmental Officer. Any recovered fuel or 
material contaminated by fuel will be removed from Antarctica by BAS. Disposal costs for 
this waste will be passed onto the Contractor.

The Contractor must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that dust is not deposited on 
the snow ramp.

6. Area protection

The Contractor must ensure that employees do not enter the Site of Special Scientific 
Interest (SSSI) at Rothera Point, or any other protected area in the Antarctic.
