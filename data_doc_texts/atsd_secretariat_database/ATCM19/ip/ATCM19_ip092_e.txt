SPEECH OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PERUVIAN DELEGATION
BEFORE THE XIX CONSULTATIVE MEETING OF THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY

SEUL, MAY 7-19, 1995

MISTER PRESIDENT OF THE XIX CONSULTATIVE MEETING,
MERSS. PRESIDENTS OF THE DELEGATION
MERSS. DELEGATES
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU, MISTER
PRESIDENT, FOR YOUR DESIGNATION TO CONDUCT THE DEBATES OF THIS
IMPORTANT REUNION; LIKEWISE, I WILL THANK, THROUGH YOU, TO THE
HONOURABLE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE KIND
WELCOME WE HAVE RECEIVED IN THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, FULL OF
CULTURE AND TRADITION.  THIS, ALONG WITH THE OPTIMISTIC
ORGANIZATION AND LOGISTIC CONDITIONS THAT ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL,
WILL LET US TO DEDICATE OURSELVES, UNDER THE BEST CONDITIONS, TO
THE TASKS ON THE COMPLICATED ANTARCTIC ISSUE THAT CONVOKE US IN
THIS OPPORTUNITY:

WE ALL KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ANTARCTICA FOR THE FUTURE OF
MANKIND.  THE SYSTEM OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY IS A SUI GENERIS
MODEL THAT HAS DEMANDED AND CONTINUES TO DEMAND THE CONVERGENCE
OF POLITICAL WILLS AND THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN TO PERFECT THE
EXISTING COOPERATION MECHANISMS WITH THE AIM OF ASSURING AN
IMPORTANT PLANETARY AREA DESTINED FOR PEACE, COOPERATION AND
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS.

THERE IS STILL SO MUCH TO BE DONE, HOWEVER, WE CAN UNDOUBTEDLY
SAY THAT THE BALANCE OF THIS PRACTICE IS OBVIOUSLY POSITIVE.

OUR SYSTEM IS TURNING INTO AN SUCCESFUL MODEL THAT, EVEN THOUGH
WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE IT BETTER, IS IMPORTANT AND ORIGINAL
ITSELF FOR THE HORIZON WE ALL WANT TO ACHIEVE FOR THE FUTURE OF
HUMANITY, THAT IS, A HORIZON FULL OF PEACE, HARMONY AND
COOPERATION. WE OWE THIS TASK TO THE COMING GENERATIONS AND, IF
WE ARE NOW GATHERED HERE, IN SEUL, IS TO MAKE OUR BEST EFFORTS
TOWARD THIS GOAL.

EACH OF THE TOPICS CONSIDERED FOR THIS MEETING COMPRISES THE
WHOLE GEAR, THE MACHINERY WE MUST BUILD UP TO THE BENEFIT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR
INCLUDING OR NOT IN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SYSTEM.

I THINK EACH COUNTRY MUST UNDERTAKE A REAL COMMITMENT AND MAKE
ITS BEST EFFORTS REGARDING THE ANTARCTICA ISSUE, WITHIN THE
LIMITATIONS AND CAPACITIES IT HAS. AND I MENTION THIS BECAUSE
THE EFFORT EACH OF OUR COUNTRIES MAKE SHALL BE PERFORMED AND
EVALUATED ACCORDING TO ITS POSSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF THE REAL
UNDERTAKING CAPACITIES PERMITTED BY ITS LEVELS OF WEALTH AND
DEVELOPMENT.
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ABOVE MENTIONED, MY COUNTRY CONTRIBUTES 
IN THIS OPPORTUNITY, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR 
SUBSEQUENT TASKS.  WE HAVE CONSTANTLY GIVEN ACCOUNT OF OUR 
ANTARCTIC VOCATION AND THE EFFORTS THAT, TO A COUNTRY SUCH AS 
PERU, REPRESENT EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES WE TAKE PART IN.  AN 
EVIDENCE OF THIS CONSTITUTES, FOR INSTANCE, THE INCLUSION OF THE 
ANTARCTIC ISSUE IN THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF OUR COUNTRY, 
THE RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL OF MADRID AND ITS ANNEXES, IN 
MARCH,  1993, OR THE SIX SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITIONS TOWARD THE 
ANTARCTICA WE HAVE PERFORMED, THE LAST OF WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT 
THE AUSTRAL SUMMER OF THIS YEAR, WITH TOO MUCH EFFORT AND BUDGET 
LIMITATIONS.

WE ARE CONVINCED THAT OUR ACTIVITIES WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND 
APPRECIATED,  TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH 
RESTRAIN US FROM WORKING TOGETHER WITH COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER 
LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCES OF ANY ORDER.

IN OUR LAST ANTARCTIC CAMPAIGN, FOR INSTANCE, BESIDES PERFORMING 
RESEARCHES ON HUMAN BIOLOGY AND OTHERS, WE CONTINUED WITH THE 
THIRD STAGE OF THE MST RADAR PROJECT, FOR MEASUREMENTS OF THE 
WINDS IN THE MESOSPHERE, STRATOSPHERE AND TROPOSPHERE.  THIS 
PROJECT, UNIQUE IN ITS TYPE, IS THE PRIDE OF OUR SCIENTISTS AND 
WE HOPE TO TURN IT INTO A FOUNDATION STONE TO COMPLEMENT MORE 
AMBICIOUS EFFORTS OF INVESTIGATION IN A WIDER AREA, THAT HAS THE 
PRESENCE OF OTHER COUNTRIES CONCERNED.  DOCUMENTATION ON THIS 
PROJECT WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE ATTENDANTS IN ORDER THAT THEY
EVALUATE THE SCOPES AND PROSPECTS OF JOINT LABOR THAT THIS 
PROJECT SUBSEQUENTLY COULD GIVE.

LIKEWISE, IN LAST JULY, LIMA WAS THE SITE FOR THE SECOND MEETING 
OF LATIN-AMERICAN ANTARCTIC HISTORIANS, EVENT IN WHICH THE 
HISTORICAL LINKS THAT JOIN THE AMERICAN CONTINENT WITH THE 
ANTARCTICA WERE REASSERTED. IN THE SAME WAY, WE PARTICIPATED IN 
THE VI MEETING OF MANAGERS OF LATIN-AMERICAN ANTARCTIC 
PROGRAMMES (IV RJAPAL) HELD IN THE CHILEAN CITY OF PUNTA ARENAS; 
OCCASION IN WHICH, WE DEALT WITH SOME TOPICS THAT WILL BE MATTER 
OF OUR WORKS HERE IN SEUL, AND ABOUT WHICH WE EXPECT TO OFFER 
POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SYSTEM.

I THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO INFORM ALSO THAT MY COUNTRY GETS 
READY TO REQUIRE, IN A SHORT TERM, THE QUALITY AS FULL MEMBER OF 
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE OF ANTARCTIC REASEARCH (SCAR) AND WITH 
THAT PURPOSE, IT PREPARES NOW THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION THAT 
PERMITS IT TO ACCEDE TO THE SAID STATUS DURING THE NEXT MEETING 
OF SCAR IN 1996. WE REQUIRE RIGHT NOW THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE 
COUNTRIES WITH FULL MEMBERSHIP IN THE SAID FORUM TO ACHIEVE THIS 
FAIR PERUVIAN DESIRE.

BEFORE FINISHING, I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE, IN THE NAME OF 
PERU, OUR FIRMEST ANTARCTIC VOCATION AND OUR DECISIVE COMMITMENT 
TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OUR EFFORTS, 
POTENTIALITIES AND RESOURCES, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE ANTARCTICA 
A FUTURE OF PEACE, COOPERATION AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, FOR THE
DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS AND THE 
FUTURE GENERATIONS WHO REPRESENT A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR US.
THUS, HERE WE ARE READY TO OFFER OUR DECISIVE ASSISTANCE FOR 
THE SUCCESS OF THIS IMPORTANT MEETING.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. PRESIDENT.
