MESSAGE:

Dear Mr. Im,

Boundary of Antarctic Special Area

As you are aware, the Antarctic is designated as a Special Area under the MARPOL 73/78
Convention as an area South of latitute 60°S. The Marine Environment Protection Committee of IMO
has received a proposal to amend the boundary of the Antarctic Special Area to make it correspond with
the biological boundary of the Antarctic Area by FOEI (MEPC 35/8/7). The Committee noted that the
proposal was to use the boundary of the Antarctic Area as defined in the Convention on the Conservation
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

The Committee was informed that the Environmental Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty has
provisions similar to MARPOL 73/78, therefore any action taken should be conducted in close co-
operation with the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.

Mr. Sander van Bennekom was kind enough to inform us that the ATCM is in session. I should
be grateful if you could arrange to ask for comments of the ATCM on the proposed amendments.

At the time of MEPC 35, I understand that the ATCM Protocol was not in force and I am aware 
that, until the Protocol enters into force, it will be impossible to amend it.

Yours sincerely,

B. Okamura
Deputy Director
Marine Environment Division
MEPC 35/3/7
