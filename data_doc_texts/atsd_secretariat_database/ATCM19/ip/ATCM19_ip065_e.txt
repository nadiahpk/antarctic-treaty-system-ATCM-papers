ACTIVITIES OF THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO)
IN ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

(Submitted by WMO)
ACTIVITIES OF THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO)
IN ANTARCTIC METEOROLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

1.      Introduction

Since XVIII ATCM in Kyoto in April 1994 the following activities of WMO have occurred which are relevant to Antarctic Treaty matters.

(a)     The Executive Council of WMO discussed and formally endorsed a series of items and recommendations considered by the Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology at its meeting in November 1993. This material was included in its preliminary form in an information paper presented to the XVIII ATCM/INFO 24);

(b)     WMO was represented at meetings of SCAR and COMNAP in August/September 1994 at which, inter alia, relevant items referred from XVIII ATCM were considered.

The following specific items resulting from ATCM, COMNAP and SCAR meetings during 1994 have been followed up by WMO.

2.      Observations

(a)     International Programme for Antarctic Buoys (IPAB)

Following an initial pilot stage this programme was formally launched at a meeting in Helsinki from 20-22 June 1994. It is organised by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) which is jointly sponsored by the World Meteorological organization (WMO), The International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). IPAB has initially 15 participants drawn from governmental and non governmental bodies in various countries each of which will seek to contribute by providing ice resisting buoys, and/or providing logistic support for deployment, data archiving and scientific advice. The objective of the Programme is to establish and maintain a network of buoys in the Antarctic sea ice zone in order to:

•       provide for the support of research into global change;

•       meet real time operational data requirements of the World Weather Watch (WWW) Programme; and

•       establish a base for ongoing monitoring of atmospheric and oceanic climate in the Antarctic sea-ice zone.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of observing buoys in the Indian Ocean sector in January 1995. The object of the new programme is to ensure a better coverage of data at high latitudes within the sea ice zone using ice resisting buoys to supplement the observations from buoys in the ocean to the north.
The programme is at an early stage and a number of technical problems with ice resisting buoys have been encountered. However there is considerable potential for research and practical applications in the future and ATCM Parties are urged to support that individual national activities in IPAB.

(b)    Interaction between WMO and IAATO (International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators)

Discussion took place at XVIII ATCM on the desirability of Antarctic Tour operators providing meteorological observations particularly through the WMO Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) scheme. Appropriate contacts have been arranged so that this activity can be further developed.

(c)    The Overall Meteorological Observations Network in Antarctica

At its meeting in June 1994 the WMO Executive Council, noting the continued absence of surface observations over West Antarctica and a decreased numbers of upper air stations in the Antarctic region urged Members of WMO to contribute to the improvement of the network by deployment of Automatic Weather Stations and by establishing new stations to fill gaps in the existing network. This question is also drawn to the attention of the ATCM Parties.

3. Telecommunications

The problem of the timely receipt of meteorological observational data from Antarctica at distant Analysis Centres continues to be a problem as it has since the inception of the station networks during the International Geophysical Year of 1957-58. Despite many improvements in technology at some stations delays still occur in the receipt of data. WMO continues to regularly monitor the telecommunications traffic and to seek solutions to particular problems. The Executive Council of WMO at its meeting in June 1994 expressed the opinion that the collection of Antarctic data within Antarctica and their insertion into the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) needed to be significantly improved. While recognizing that HF type circuits are still necessary in some cases the Council exhorted Members to investigate the possibilities of using more advanced technology. The Council re-emphasised the target time of within three hours for the reception of datasets from the Basic Synoptic Network in Antarctica at Centres on the Main Trunk Network of the GTS and at other stations in the Antarctic itself. ATCM Parties are urged through their appropriate national mechanisms to use every effort to improve where necessary the transmission of meteorological data from Antarctica.

4. Services

(a)    WMO Executive Council endorsed the arrangements proposed by its Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology for the provision of specific meteorological services in Antarctica from the five stations, Casey, McMundo, Marambio, Molodezhnaya and Presidente Frei. In some cases these stations will be supported in their task by processed data and analyses and prognoses produced by Analysis Centres located outside Antarctica.
(b) Meteorological and Oceanographic Services for Antarctic Oil Spill Events

WMO provided an information paper to the meeting of COMNAP in September 
1994 which outlined the current state of modelling of pollution dispersion at sea 
and arrangements which WMO has taken for the general area of the world oceans 
via the development of its Marine Pollution Emergency Response Support System 
(MPERSS). This system is at an evolutionary stage and will require the support 
of various national governments to become fully operational and is to be 
developed further in conjunction with input from IOC, UNEP and IMO.

COMNAP has determined that in the light of its policy on prevention measures 
and in view of the logistic difficulties involved in dealing with oil spills in the 
Antarctic waters particularly in sea ice it does not consider that the use of 
numerical dispersion models based on meteorological and oceanographic data are 
useful or relevant at this time.

●   5. Research

The principal international research program in broadscale Antarctic meteorology 
currently under way is FROST (First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere in 
Antarctica) which is being conducted by the SCAR Working Group on the Physics and 
Chemistry of the Atmosphere (PACA). It is an experiment to assess the quality of 
numerical weather analysis and prognosis over Antarctica and the surrounding oceans. 
It is intended to lead to the development of improved assimilation schemes in global 
weather prediction models and ultimately to better operational information and forecasts 
for those working in Antarctica . FROST data are being collected in 3 Special Observing 
Periods (SOP) viz July 1994, October/November 1994 and January 1995 Analysis of the 
data by an international team of scientists will proceed during 1994/1996.

●   6. Information Exchange

The WMO Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology has initiated a system of annual 
exchange of information on national Antarctic meteorological activities. An example of 
the information exchanged is shown in Figure 2.

In addition to this annual exchange an effort is being made to produce a catalogue of 
historical Antarctic meteorological data held in the various WMO member countries. 
Information for the following countries is now available, Australia, China, France, Japan, 
New Zealand, Poland and Russia.
