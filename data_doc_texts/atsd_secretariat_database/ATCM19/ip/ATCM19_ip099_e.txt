Agenda Item 3
____________________________________________________
OPENING ADDRESS BY AMBASSADOR LUIZ AMADO,
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF BRAZIL

Mr. Chairman,

On behalf of the Brazilian Delegation, may I extend to you my
warmest congratulations on your election as Chairman of the XIXth Antartic
Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Being the Ambassador of Brazil in Seoul since 1990, I have the
priviledge of excellent personal relations with Ambassador Lee and I bear
witness to his exceeding competence, zeal and experience, assets that will be
instrumental to the success of our meeting.

I would also like to thank the Korean Government for the high
quality of the facilities and services provided to the delegations and for the
flawless preparation for the meeting in this dynamic city of Seoul.

Mr. Chairman,

As you know, man has two kinds of relationships in this planet: with
his fellow human beings and with nature. We are gathered here to work on some
aspects of paramount importance related to the latter. We have in front of us a
fairly heavy loaded agenda, which tackles basic topics pertaining to the
presence of man in Antarctica and the protection of the unique environment of
that continent.

In this respect, we deeply appreciate the establishment, last week,
of the Transitional Environmental Working Group, an organ which, pending the
entry into force of the Madrid Protocol, will prepare the way for the Committee for
Environmental Protection to be created under this instrument.

The Brazilian Delegation considers the Antartic Treaty a model of
cooperation among States. We firmly believe that the Consultative Meetings
should reflect this atmosphere of broad friendship and understanding in trying to
find ways and means of solving outstanding and sometimes difficult questions
which lay before us.

In this respect, we commend the efforts deployed by the Group of
Experts on Liability for Damages to the Antarctic Environment, conducted under
the able Chairmanship of Professor Rudiger Wolfrum. This Group has the very
difficult task of examining the many intricacies involved in devising a legal
regime which could enhance and promote the goals of the Protocol.
It is the hope of my Delegation that substantial progress can be 
made in this most important issue, so that the Parties may be able, not very far 
in the future, to adopt an effective and comprehensive liability annex which could 
fulfill the expectations of all the actors interested in the protection of the 
practically virgin and fragile Antarctic environment.

Another outstanding point is the establishment of the Secretariat, 
the need of which seems to be beyond discussion. Preparatory work on legal 
and administrative arrangements for its functioning has been done since the 
Venice Meeting and, although not concluded, has made remarkable progress.

Unfortunately we cannot say the same about the question of the 
seat of the Secretariat, a matter which regrettably seems still likely to delay the 
process of establishment of that organ.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to announce that the Brazilian 
Congress has nearly completed its process of approval of the Madrid Protocol. 
The Chamber of Deputies has already given consent to its ratification and I am 
informed that the Plenary of the Senate is likely to examine the text this very 
week. The Government, therefore, hopes to be entitled to ratify the Protocol in 
the next few weeks.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
