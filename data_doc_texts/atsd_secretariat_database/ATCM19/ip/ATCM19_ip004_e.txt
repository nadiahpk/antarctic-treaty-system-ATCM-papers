(Submitted by the IHO)
REPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION (IHO)
TO THE XIXth ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING (ATCM)
Seoul, Republic of Korea, 8-11 May 1995

1.      Background - Summary

The IHO Permanent Working Group for Cooperation in Antarctica (PWGCA) was formally established in 1992 to better meet the requirements contained in Recommendation 19 adopted by the XVth ATCM (Paris, 9-20 October 1989). This recommendation was originated by merging two proposals put forward by Spain and UK, and taking into account suggestions proposed by other delegations at that meeting. The Terms of Reference of the WG are attached to this report at Appendix 1.

A Report on the work of the IHO PWGCA was given in Kyoto at the XVIIIth ATCM - 11-22 April 1994. Pages 187 to 212 of the final report of that meeting contain the report in full.

After the XVIIIth ATCM, the IHO PWGCA met in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, in order to consolidate the promising achievements reached in the previous meetings; the following paragraphs summarize the present status of the work of the IHO PWGCA.

2.      Progress report of the IHO PWGCA

This progress report is based on the achievements reached during the 2nd meeting of the PWGCA (July 1994, Buenos Aires), on the liaisons with SCAR and COMNAP during SCAR XXIII (Rome, August-September 1994) and on the follow-on actions within IHO.

a)      The IHO Database on "Status of Hydrographic Surveying and Nautical Charting in Antarctica". This database is provided in graphic and digital form in the IHO publication S-59 (same title). The most recent edition (December 1993) has been distributed to all IHO Member States. An additional distribution has been made to all national managers of Antarctic Programmes and to SCAR. The database is carefully kept up to date by the IHB and a third edition of S-59 is due to be published in November 1995. IHO Member States will provide their inputs by June-July 1995. Inputs will mainly cover:

-       existing national and international nautical charts and bathymetric maps;
-       hydrographic and bathymetric surveys carried out and planned (geographic areas and type of survey);
-       tide gauge stations;
-       density of oceanic soundings;
-       list of scientific bases.

The database is extended to the entire area of the Antarctic Treaty.

b)      Hydrographic Surveys

Through the action of the PWGCA hydrographic surveys are coordinated and duplication of effort is minimized. The IHB keeps a record of the national planned surveys and disseminates the information to all interested IHO Member States.

c)      INTernational Nautical Charts for Antarctica

As reported to the XVIII ATCM, the IHB developed a draft INT Chart scheme aimed at covering the entire Antarctic Treaty area with an homogeneous (standardized) series of modern nautical charts. The scheme already discussed in Valparaiso during the first PWGCA meeting was approved with some slight modifications in Buenos Aires.

1
In addition, almost 80% of the production of charts contained in the scheme has been 
allocated to volunteering IHO Member States and the first INT Chart is being published 
in January 1995.

The Antarctic region has been included in the worldwide IHO project for the INT Charts 
production under the name of region "M". See figure 1.

The IHB has been nominated coordinator of the charting allocation within area "M".

Some of the charts at small scale have been extended north of 60°S in order to properly 
plan navigation to the Antarctic continent from the other ones and vice versa.

The charting scheme is reported in Annex B, while Annex C is a list of the INT charts 
indicating their number, scale, limit and the nation who has volunteered to produce them.

Once a chart is produced by the volunteering nation, all the other IHO Member States 
can reproduce it and insert it into their own portfolio, in accordance with the IHO rules 
governing the INT Chart production and reproduction.

d)     Toponymy on the INT Charts

       The PWGCA:

       (i)     considering that:
               -    achieving a uniform toponymic policy is a difficult problem to be solved;
               -    the IHO as a forum cannot impose the use of particular names;
               -    this subject is being given attention by the full ATCM process which 
                     involves foreign ministries of the countries concerned;

       (ii)    not wishing to allow political problems, associated with names, to divert 
               Hydrographic Offices from the aim of providing safe products for the mariners 
               of Antarctica, in order not to interfere with the IHO tradition of cooperation, 
               reached the following agreement for toponymic practice:
               -    any INT Chart producer nation should be free to include the 
                     names that they feel are appropriate;
               -    the printer (reproducer) nation can retain the right to alter 
                     names to accord with their own national policy;
               -    if required, both sets of names can be shown on the INT chart 
                     using the existing IHO INT Chart Specifications.

e)     Depiction of Territorial Claims

       The PWGCA agreed in principle not to depict any territorial claim on nautical charts.

f)     Symbology

       Nautical chart symbology is well standardized within IHO. A permanent Committee (the 
       Chart Standardization Committee) studies and proposes to the IHO community any 
       modification to symbols.

       The complete list of nautical chart symbols is contained in the IHO publication INT 1. An 
       examination of the available symbols, already listed in that publication and which can be 
2
used in Antarctic waters, was carried out by the PWGCA and it was concluded that 
almost all the specific needs for the region (protected areas - ice features, etc..) are 
already covered. Some other symbols which still do not exist, such as scientific bases, 
animal colonies sites, etc.., which have also been identified by SCAR, will be proposed 
for adoption to the CSC. Coordination with SCAR on this issue has been activated (see 
para. 3 below).

3.    Cooperation with SCAR

An IHO representative attended the XXIII SCAR in Rome, Italy (23 August - 1 September). The 
IHO contribution to the SCAR works (SCAR Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic 
Information) has been established in:

-    collecting information on tide gauges established in Antarctica;

-    providing SCAR with the IHO gazetteers of undersea feature names South of 
60°S for inclusion in SCAR composite gazetteers citing IHO as the source 
(action in progress). In turn the IHB has been provided with a copy of SCAR 
Gazeteer of Antarctic names.

-    providing SCAR with bathymetric products which satisfy scientific users' needs 
upon request. in turn SCAR will collect information on bathymetric data 
available from other Antarctic programmes and advise GEBCO (General 
Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans organization). These actions will be initiated 
by SCAR. GEBCO-IHO liaison is assured.

-    liaise with SCAR for symbols appearing on both maps and charts - (action 
initiated).

4.    Cooperation with COMNAP - SCALOP

COMNAP representatives are permanently invited to participate in the meetings of the IHO 
PWGCA. It is IHO's understanding that, as a result of the cooperation established, COMNAP and 
SCALOP intend to continue a close liaison with the International Hydrographic Organization and 
its Permanent Working Group on Cooperation in Antarctica and that the IHO INT chart scheme 
for the Antarctic region is recognized by COMNAP as a major cooperative effort that will benefit 
the safety and the efficiency of Antarctic ship operations and as such has been endorsed by 
COMNAP. It is also understood that to help to define the needs and priority for surveying and 
charting, the members of COMNAP assist by ensuring that the relevant navigational information 
is properly passed to national hydrographic offices.

5.    Conclusion

IHO believes that the established hydrographic surveying and nautical charting cooperation is 
going to meet the Recommendation XV-19 cited in paragraph 1 of this report. To fully achieve 
the results indicated contained in that recommendation i.e. "hydrographic survey and charting 
of Antarctic waters" in their entirety, it is vital that the cooperation continues and be adequately 
supported by the National Antarctic programmes.

6.  Proposal

IHO proposes that the following ATCM recommendation be adopted (already included for 
information in the IHO Report to the 18th ATCM, Kyoto, 1995).

XIX ...... STRENGTHENING THE COOPERATION IN HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING AND 
CHARTING OF ANTARCTIC WATERS

The representatives,

1.      Having noted that as an implementation of the recommendation ATCM XV-19 the 
        International Hydrographic Organization has established within its Member States a 
        Permanent Working Group on Cooperation in Antarctica with the aim of coordinating the 
        hydrographic surveys and producing International nautical charts along the standards 
        of the IHO;

2.      Recognizing the significant step forward made by the IHO Permanent Working Group 
        for Cooperation in Antarctica which has established a scheme of INTERNATIONAL charts 
        to ensure safe navigation in Antarctic waters;

3.      Considering that the INT chart scheme for Antarctica has been agreed by IHO Member 
        States and that a number of them volunteered for chart production;

4.      Considering that the PWGCA permanently liaises with SCAR for supporting scientific 
        research which needs hydrographic products;

5.      considering that COMNAP endorses the IHO INT chart scheme for the Antarctic region;

6.      considering that the Antarctic waters require a considerable effort in manpower and 
        equipment to carry out hydrographic surveys adequate for nautical chart production.

Recommend that

"All Member States with a hydrographic surveying and charting capability in Antarctica are 
encouraged to stress nationally that their surveying and charting activities in Antarctica are being 
coordinated through the IHO's PWG on Cooperation in Antarctica. In particular, it is suggested 
that they emphasize the INT chart scheme initiative and their national contribution to it. This 
international cooperation through the IHO is to be considered as implementing Recommendation 
XV-19 of the XVth Antarctica Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and thus allows Member States 
to emphasize the international commitment and nature of their Antarctic activities particularly 
when seeking national support for hydrographic surveying and charting pricrities and budget."

For the convenience of the ATCM Secretariat, the above recommendation is reproduced as Annex A.

PERMANENT WORKING GROUP ON COOPERATION IN ANTARCTICA

The Working Group will have the following Terms of Reference:-

a) Examine INT Chart standards with respect to their application to Antarctica.

b) Develop an INT Chart Scheme, or a scheme of charts agreed to by members, covering 
   all Antarctic waters (south of 60 degrees South - Region M), acting in a capacity of a 
   regional charting group coordinated by the IHB.

c) Ensure that the small scale charts of the INT chart scheme for Antarctic waters are 
   adequately connected to the existing small scale INT charting scheme for the adjacent 
   areas.

d) Examine the status and quality of hydrographic surveys, and encourage the publication 
   of source reliability diagrams on all published charts of Antarctica.

e) Identify the needs for improved surveys and charts (taking account of advice from 
   COMNAP and other organizations on predicting shipping and other needs).

f) Develop cooperative approaches to meeting the needs/priorities for surveys and 
   charting.

g) Establish and maintain liaison with the IHO/IOC GEBCO organization concerning 
   Antarctic bathymetric data collection and charting.

h) Maintain appropriate liaison with relevant scientific organizations, including SCAR 
   (Geodesy and Geographic Information Working Group), IOC and COMNAP.

i) Develop an annual report of the status and plans for hydrographic surveys, including 
   updating and amplifying S-59.
