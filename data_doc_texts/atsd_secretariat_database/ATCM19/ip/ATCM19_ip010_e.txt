NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

1. Introduction

An Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) has been carried out by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) for 
the redevelopment of Signy Research Station (60° 43'S, 45° 36'W), Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, 
Antarctica. The IEE has been prepared in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

2. Description of the activity

The BAS proposes that the activities carried out at Signy Research Station should be rationalised, with the 
present year-round station being closed and replaced by a smaller summer-only facility. The purpose of the 
redevelopment is to increase efficiency and provide new opportunities for freshwater biological research in 
the maritime Antarctic.

The redevelopment will be carried out during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 seasons. It will involve the assembly 
of a new living and laboratory building on the same site as the present main storage building, refurbishment 
of two existing buildings as a powerhouse and a storage building, and the construction of a fully bunded fuel 
storage area.

3. Alternatives

Four alternatives to the redevelopment have been examined:

i)      rebuild and expansion of Signy Research Station;
ii)     use of other sites on Signy Island as the location for the summer-only station;
iii)    use of existing station facilities in the Antarctic Peninsula region;
iv)     do nothing and attempt to use the existing facilities at Signy.

After careful consideration, the BAS decided that all four options were not viable due to a combination of 
financial, scientific, logistic and environmental reasons.

4. Description of the environment

The research station is located on the east side of Factory Cove, Borge Bay where the ground consists of 
boulders and scree, covered in lichens and mosses. Cape petrels and snow petrels are the most abundant 
breeding birds nearby, and nest on Factory Bluffs, 30 m to the south of the station. There are no penguin or 
seal colonies, and no rare terrestrial or marine biota found in or around Factory Cove.

5. Impact assessment

The new facility will have significantly less environmental impact than the existing station. It will operate 
only during the austral summer rather than all year, and the summer population on the station will fall from 
a maximum of 27 scientists and support staff to 8.

A direct impact of the construction activities will be disturbance of soil during site excavation and 
preparation work. The total area likely to be affected is estimated as 1800 m^(2). The construction of the fuel 
storage area may result in the destruction of a small area of vegetation (< 30 m^(2)). Based on long-term 
biological monitoring at Signy, any excavated open-ground will, over a period of decades, become 
recolonised by native mosses and lichens. No moss banks near the station will be disturbed.

Breeding Cape petrels, snow petrels and skuas are unlikely to be disturbed either by noise or by physical 
disturbance. A few nest sites of Antarctic prion or Wilson storm petrels within the station area may be 
disturbed or destroyed, but both species are tolerant of human activity and have rapidly recolonised 
excavated ground in the past.

Unused buildings and facilities will be removed at a future date. Until then, the BAS will carry out basic

−1−
building maintenance in compliance with UK health and safety requirements for unoccupied premises.

6. Mitigating measures

The major mitigation measure proposed to prevent impact from construction activities will be to prohibit work outside of the areas already disturbed by station activities.

The small risk of an oil spill occurring at Signy will be reduced further. The present bulk fuel tank will be replaced by a fully bunded and valved off fuel storage area, serviced by a new flexible fuel pipeline. Comprehensive response measures are already in place in case of an oil spill, including a station oil spill contingency plan and on-site clean-up equipment and materials.

The major measure recommended for the future operation of Signy Research Station is the production of a station management and maintenance plan. This will direct planning decisions and ensure all facilities are maintained to appropriate standards.

7. Environmental monitoring and management

The environmental management of the redevelopment will be put under close scrutiny by the BAS. A monitoring programme examining the environmental impact of the station will be continued. The BAS Environmental Officer will carry out an environmental inspection of the rebuild during the 1995/96 season. The BAS will coordinate an environmental audit of Signy Research Station within five years of the completion of the project.

8. Conclusion

This draft Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) indicates that the redevelopment of Signy Research Station is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, provided the mitigation measures advised are carried out. It is therefore considered that a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) need not be prepared.

1. INTRODUCTION

This document is an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) carried out by the British 
Antarctic Survey (BAS) for the redevelopment of Signy Research Station, Signy Island, 
South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. It has been prepared in accordance with Annex I of the 
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY

2.1 Purpose

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a component research institute of the Natural 
Environment Research Council (NERC), is undertaking a restructuring of its facilities in 
Antarctica. As part of the restructuring programme, the BAS proposes that the activities 
carried out at its Signy Research Station should be rationalised, with the present 
year-round station being closed and replaced by a smaller summer-only facility.

The aim of the redevelopment is to:

i)      replace obsolete buildings;
ii)     increase the efficiency of BAS operations;
iii)    provide new opportunities for freshwater biological research in the maritime 
Antarctic;
iv)     continue the bird monitoring programme carried out for the Convention on the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

By 1996/97, Signy Research Station, currently operating as the main centre for the BAS 
inshore marine, terrestrial and freshwater biology research programmes in Antarctica, will 
become the focus of summer freshwater research projects. CCAMLR monitoring will also 
continue. The inshore marine and terrestrial research programmes will transfer to Rothera 
Research Station (67° 34’S, 68° 08’W), Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, Antarctica where 
new laboratories and accommodation are under construction (BAS, 1995).

2.2 Location

The proposed redevelopment will be at Signy Research Station (60° 43’S, 45° 36’W), 
Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica (Figure 1).

The station began operations in 1947 when a site in Factory Cove, Borge Bay, Signy 
Island was occupied by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS). The area had 
previously been used as the location for a small whaling station in 1920/21.

In 1993/94, the station complex covered an area of 9800 m^(2) (Plate 1). There are six main 
buildings, and a number of smaller structures as well as associated radio aerials and a bulk 
fuel tank. The buildings contain laboratories, controlled temperature experimental rooms, a 
seawater aquarium and a SCUBA diving facility. They are closely grouped around a small 
jetty and slipway.

The maximum number of people which can be accommodated on the station is 27, with an 
average summer population of 24. The winter complement is 12 - 16.

2.3 Principal characteristics of the proposed redevelopment

The proposed redevelopment at Signy (BAS, 1994) will involve the following work:

i)     The existing storage building, Sørlle House, will be dismantled and removed from 
       Antarctica.

ii)    A combined living and laboratory building will be constructed on the same site as 
       Sørlle House. It will contain modern laboratories for freshwater science, including 
       chemical and radioisotope analysis suites. The building will house up to 8 scientists 
       and support staff in four two-person bunkrooms, and a further 2 maintenance staff 
       can be accommodated for short periods in an overflow two-person bunkroom.

iii)   The existing boathouse will be refurbished as a powerhouse containing two mobile 
       generators (producing up to 60 kVA each) and associated plant.

iv)    The existing powerhouse will be refurbished to house a waste compactor and 
       provide dry storage and freezer space.

v)     A fully bunded fuel storage area, consisting of two steel tanks designed to hold 
       100 m^(3) of fuel, will be constructed in front of the present main building. The 
       concrete bunded area will be capable of containing all the fuel stored in the tanks.

vi)    Unused buildings and facilities will be closed (the present main accommodation 
       and laboratory building, Tonsberg House, woodstore, generator containers and the 
       bulk fuel tank). All contents will be removed from these buildings, which will be 
       sealed and left in a weatherproof condition.

Figure 2 shows Signy Research Station, the proposed location of the new combined living 
and laboratory building and fuel storage area, and buildings which are to be closed. Table 
1 gives details of the proposed new and refurbished buildings, and Table 2 details of those 
which will be closed.

2.4 Duration

Site demolition of Sørlle House will take place during March 1995. Construction and 
fitting-out of the new building and refurbishment of the existing powerhouse and 
boathouse are planned for the 1995/96 austral summer. The new facility will have a design 
life-span of ten years.

BAS. All of the contractor's plant and materials, and most personnel will be transported to Signy by BAS vessels. The building contractor will be accommodated at the station, and a separate camp will not be required. Site demolition in 1994/95 will involve 4 contractor's staff who will be on site for a maximum of 26 days. Construction and refurbishment work in the 1995/96 season will involve a maximum of 15 contractor's staff at any one time for a maximum of 154 days. The total volume of cargo imported for the building programme in 1994/95 was 18 m^(3), and in 1995/96 the estimated total will be 400 m^(3).

By 1996/97 it is expected that the redevelopment of Signy Research Station will be complete and the planned science programme fully operational. The station will then be able to house a maximum of 8 scientists and support personnel, with short-stay, overflow accommodation available for a further 2 maintenance staff.

3. ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSAL

3.1 Rebuild and expansion of Signy Research Station

The BAS originally planned to rebuild Signy Research Station completely and carried out an IEE for this proposed activity (BAS, 1990). The IEE suggested that the existing station be replaced with a new, enlarged facility which would increase the maximum summer accommodation capacity from 27 to 40 people. Although, new funding was made available by government to the BAS this was insufficient for a total rebuild, and the option therefore had to be rejected.

3.2 Alternative sites on Signy Island

Two other sites on Signy Island were considered as the location of the new facility: Waterpipe Beach and Berntsen Point.

3.2.1 Waterpipe Beach

Waterpipe Beach, Borge Bay, was considered because it lies close to where the majority of the freshwater biology fieldwork will be undertaken. The site was rejected because: the beach is composed of large boulders, is relatively exposed in comparison to Factory Cove, and it has no safe anchorage immediately offshore. These factors would make resupply hazardous without the construction of a substantial wharf. In addition, the area is still relatively undisturbed by human activities, except for a small water pipeline left by the whalers. Construction at Waterpipe Beach would therefore create new human impact on Signy.

3.2.2 Berntsen Point

The area directly to the north of the present main laboratory and accommodation building on Berntsen Point was also considered as an alternative site. It was rejected because the terrain is variable, ranging from large rock boulders, to wet moss carpet and mud. These conditions would make the construction of building foundations difficult.

Neither of the two alternative sites was acceptable either on environmental or logistical 
grounds and so these options were rejected.

3.3 Use of other station facilities in the Antarctic Peninsula region

Apart from Signy, the only other existing station in the Antarctic Peninsula region which 
carries out a large-scale, year-round biological research programme is Palmer Research 
Station (USA) (64° 46’S, 64° 03’W), Arthur Harbour, Anvers Island. However, because 
spare summer accommodation is not available at Palmer, this alternative was dismissed.

3.4 Do nothing and attempt to use the existing facilities at Signy

The existing facilities at Signy Research Station are now outmoded. The main living and 
science block dates from 1963/64 and has become increasingly difficult to operate and 
maintain. The station also does not meet current UK health and safety requirements. This 
option was therefore unacceptable and rejected.

3.5 Summary of alternatives

The BAS concluded that the most viable option was to replace the existing station with a 
new, purpose built facility on the existing site.

4. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT

The environment of Signy Island is described in Rootes (1988) and BAS (1990). The three 
main environmental parameters which may be affected by the rebuild are terrestrial flora, 
breeding birds and seals.

4.1 Terrestrial flora

Dry moss carpet, mostly Drepanocladus uncinatus and Polytrichum alpestre, is the most 
abundant vegetation type adjacent to the station. The carpet is interspersed by large 
boulders supporting dense lichen cover, including Usnea spp., Umbilicaria spp., Xanthoria 
spp. and Rhizocarpon spp. The moss carpet on Berntsen Point, to the north of the station, 
shows considerable impact from trampling by fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), as well as 
more localised damage by human disturbance and minor oil spills. Much of the moss in 
this area is now brown and dead, and has been colonised by the nitrophilous foliose green 
alga Prasiola crispa. The wetter areas on the east side of Factory Cove, behind and above 
the station, support a moss hummock carpet, including Brachythecium austro-salebrosum 
and Calliergon sarmentosum.

Vascular plants are common in sheltered north-facing hollows and crevices on Factory 
Bluffs. Small stands both of Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and Antarctic 
pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) are found. Scattered plants of the grass have also 
become established within a few metres of some station buildings (Lewis-Smith, 1990).

−9−
A coastal fellfield vegetation community is found on the more exposed and higher slopes 
of Berntsen Point and Factory Bluffs, and is dominated by the lichens Usnea spp., 
Himantormia spp., Cladonia spp. and other crustose species. Small patches of the mosses 
Andreaea spp. and Polytrichum spp. are found between lichen-covered boulders.

There are no rare terrestrial flora on Berntsen Point or Factory Bluffs.

4.2 Breeding birds and seals

The most abundant birds found in Factory Cove are Cape petrels (Daption capense) and 
snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea). It is estimated that 135 pairs of Cape petrels and 25 pairs 
of snow petrels nest on Factory Bluffs (Brockington, personal communication, 1995). A 
few nests of both species are also found on the north and east faces of Berntsen Point. The 
breeding success of these petrels does not appear to have been adversely affected by the 
operation of the station, at least since petrel monitoring studies began in 1976 (Croxall, 
personal communication, 1995).

Wilson’s storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata) and 
black-bellied storm petrels (Fregetta tropica) nest in rock crevices and under boulders on 
Berntsen Point. Numbers of these birds nesting in the station area are very difficult to 
estimate. The most common of the three is the Wilson’s storm petrel, and there may be 
about 150 pairs in the area (Milius, personal communication, 1994). Both Wilson’s storm 
petrels and Antarctic prions nest adjacent to, and underneath, station buildings.

Brown skuas (Catharacta lonnbergi) breed just north and east of the station. One pair 
nests at the northern end of Berntsen Point, and the other on the moss banks below 
Factory Bluffs. Compared with a survey of breeding skuas in 1982 (Hemmings, 1982), it 
is apparent that the number of breeding skuas near the station has remained constant and 
the birds have been faithful to individual nest sites for over a decade. The operation of the 
station does not appear to have adversely affected the breeding population.

There are no penguin colonies on Berntsen Point. Small numbers of Adelie (Pygoscelis 
adeliae), chinstrap (P. antarctica) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins come ashore.

Factory Cove has no seal breeding sites, although small numbers of Weddell seals 
(Leptonychotes weddelli) with pups are seen each winter on sea-ice in Shallow Bay. 
Elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are common in Factory Cove and up to 20 - 30 haul 
out regularly to moult on beaches and slopes near the shore.

By far the most abundant seal on Signy Island is the fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella). In 
February 1994, approximately 20,000 were counted on Signy. The population explosion of 
the seal at its main breeding locations on South Georgia has meant that there is now an 
annual migration of the overspill population, mostly juvenile males, to Signy Island. The 
influx of fur seals has had a significant environmental impact: large areas of vegetation 
have been destroyed, and many lakes have been polluted. Approximately 100 - 200 fur 
seals may be present on low-lying ground near the station in January and February each 
year. In 1990, a fence was erected across Berntsen Point to prevent seals from damaging 
the moss banks, and terrestrial biology research experiments close to the station.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF IMPACTS

5.1 Data and methods

Impact matrices have been used to identify the scale of the predicted impacts of the redevelopment of Signy station. The matrices were produced by analysing a list of the activities associated with the redevelopment against a list of environmental parameters. Impacts that were considered to be highly unlikely were not considered in the matrices.

Each identified environmental impact has been subdivided into one of four categories: nil or negligible; low; medium; and high. Criteria for assessing the level of impact are shown in Table 3.

Table 3    Criteria for assessing the level of environmental impacts associated with the redevelopment of Signy Research Station.

 
|       |                     Impact                     |              Extent of impact              |       |              Duration of impact              |
| :---: | :---------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :---: | :-------------------------------------------: |

|  O   |                     negligible                  |              Zero or minimal                | and/or |              minutes to hours                |
|  L   |                  Low impact                    |        Signy station and immediate area     | and/or |                days to weeks                 |
|  M   |                Medium impact                   |      Berntsen Point and Factory Cove        | and/or |           months to a few seasons            |
|  H   |                  High impact                   |              Signy Island                  | and/or |          several years to decades            |

The rankings of the different categories of impact in the matrices are based on value judgements. These judgements were based on current scientific and technical knowledge, and where possible, only made after examining the results of the environmental monitoring programme already established at Signy (see Section 7.1).

Two impact matrices were produced:

i)   Matrix 1 shows the impacts associated with demolition of the present storage building and construction of the new summer station (Table 4);
ii)  Matrix 2 shows the impacts associated with the operation of the summer research station (Table 5).

-11-
5.2 Impact of dismantling and construction activities

Table 4 shows no predicted high impact from dismantling and construction activities.

5.2.1 Terrestrial impacts

A direct terrestrial impact will be the disturbance of soil due to the dismantling of Sørlle House and site preparation work for the new living and laboratory building, fuel storage area. The total area likely to be affected by this work will be approximately 1800 m^(2). However, the impact will be limited as the new building will be located on the same site as Sørlle House, and the fuel storage area will be built mostly on areas of ground which have been levelled in the past.

The construction of the fuel storage area may result in the destruction of a small area of vegetation (< 30 m^(2)), mostly lichens, to the north of the present main building. There are no plants or lichens growing on the site of the proposed new living and laboratory building. Long-term biological monitoring at Signy shows that excavated open-ground will, over a period of decades, become patchily recolonised by native moss species, such as Ceratodon purpureus and Pottia austro-georgica (Lewis-Smith, 1990). Over a similar time scale, the concrete bund of the fuel storage area will be colonised by the lichens Xanthoria elegans and Caloplaca spp.

Most rock and cement dust will settle within 10 m of the building sites, although small amounts could discolour rocks up to 100 m downwind. Cement dust is highly alkaline (pH 11) and could cause physiological damage to lichens growing on Factory Bluffs and Berntsen Point, especially Umbilicaria decussata, Usnea antarctica and U. sphacelata. Heavy contamination of lichens by concrete dust, which could cause the bleaching and easy detachment of plants, is unlikely as all concrete mixing sites will be on areas of bare, levelled ground at least 15 m away from the nearest vegetation downwind.

Emissions from diesel generators are not expected to increase above present levels during demolition and construction activities. Monitoring of heavy metals (zinc, lead, cadmium, aluminium and manganese) in the lichen Usnea antarctica at sites around the station in 1992 showed that there has been local ground contamination from pollution fallout (Figure 3). The highest metal levels are generally found immediately next to the station diesel generators, particularly zinc, but then quickly decline with distance away from the source. Background levels of metals in lichens are reached at a maximum of 200 m downwind. The biological effects of pollution fallout are expected to be minimal.

Antarctic prions and Wilson’s storm petrels may have nest burrows within the proposed construction sites. A few nest sites may be destroyed. However, both species are tolerant of human activity and can be expected to recolonise the area within a few years, as they have done in the past. Breeding Cape petrels, snow petrels, black-bellied storm petrels and skuas are unlikely to be disturbed either by noise or by physical disturbance. The nearest nests of these four species are those of Cape petrels and snow petrels on Factory Bluffs, which are at least 30 m from the nearest construction site.

Disturbance to seals will be minimal as fur seals normally avoid coming within 50 m of the station, and elephant seals only occasionally haul-out on the beach beside the jetty.

The importation of building equipment and materials to Signy during the construction 
phase will increase the risk of the accidental introduction of non-native biota, particularly 
micro-organisms. To reduce the risk, the tender specification for the redevelopment 
requires the contractor to clean equipment before despatch to Antarctica (Appendix 1).

5.2.2 Marine impacts

The volume of sewage effluent released during the summer construction periods will be 
similar to that currently produced each summer. Sewage, wet food waste and grey water 
are discharged untreated into the sea by an outfall located beside the station jetty. Wet 
food waste is first macerated and then discharged into the sea via the same outfall.

The effluent adds nutrients, heavy metals, organic pollutants, suspended sediments, and 
solids at, and in the immediate locality of, the outfall. The impact of the effluent is very 
localised and contained within Factory Cove. Visible waste mater is confined to within 
15 m of the outfall pipe. Monitoring of heavy metals (copper, cadmium, zinc, lead and 
manganese) in surface water samples in Factory Cove in 1992 showed elevated 
concentrations of all metals immediately next to the outfall pipe, but they then declined 
extremely rapidly away from the outfall (Figure 3). Background levels of all metals in 
surface water are reached at a maximum of 20 m offshore.

5.2.3 Atmosphere, glacier ice and snow impacts

Construction activities will result in airborne dust from earth moving, concrete batching 
and site preparation. However, the wet conditions found at Signy are likely to keep soil 
and concrete damp and so minimise dust levels. Local topography, particularly Factory 
Bluffs, also causes much wind turbulence. Dust and gases will therefore be quickly 
dispersed and will not add to atmospheric background levels after mixing. The majority of 
exhaust emissions will be carried out into Borge Bay by the prevailing westerly winds.

5.2.4 Human values

The dismantling of Sørlle House and the removal of contents from unused buildings will 
result in the production of a considerable amount of material and waste for export. It is 
estimated that approximately 150 m^(3) of building waste will be removed in the 1994/95 
season and approximately 300 m^(3) in 1995/96.

The inshore marine biological research programme finished at Signy during February 
1995. Terrestrial research will continue through to the end of the 1995/96 season.

The dismantling and construction activities will be confined to the existing main station 
area (Zone A in Figure 2). There will be no more than a local impact on wilderness value.

5.3 Impacts of operation

The new facility will have significantly less environmental impact than the existing 
research station. It will only operate during the austral summer (approximately 160 days 
year^(-1)) rather than all year, and the maximum summer population on the station will fall

from 27 scientists and support staff to 8.

Table 5 shows no predicted high impacts from the operation of the new facility.

5.3.1 Terrestrial impacts

The reduction in scientific fieldwork carried out at Signy will lead to a decrease in environmental impact. Freshwater science will become the primary focus of the new station and, as is found now, there will be localised and minor impact from some scientific experiments and continued use of footpaths radiating from the station to the main study sites. Detailed monitoring at Signy has failed to demonstrate long-term environmental change related specifically to freshwater science.

The dismantling of unused buildings and facilities, after the redevelopment has been completed, will cause soil disturbance. The total area likely to be affected by this work will be approximately 1500 m2. Dismantling will destroy small areas of vegetation and may also disturb a small number of nest burrows used by Antarctic prions and Wilson’s storm petrels (see Section 5.2.1). The removal of the bulk fuel tank and fuel lines will require particular care to minimise any fuel contamination of the surrounding soil.

5.3.2 Marine impacts

Compared with the present station, the new facility will have only a very minor and seasonal impact on the marine environment. It is estimated that the volume of effluent produced during the austral summer will decrease by 60 - 70% compared with present levels. The new facility will continue to discharge effluent into Factory Cove via the outfall at the jetty. It is considered unlikely that the effluent could be detected more than 10 m away from the outfall.

5.3.3 Atmosphere, glacier ice and snow impacts

The redevelopment of the station will mean a substantial decrease in power generation and a substantial reduction in the volume of exhaust emissions. During the austral summer emissions are expected to decrease by 70 - 80% compared with present levels.

5.3.4 Minor fuel leaks

The small risk of a fuel spill at Signy will be reduced further by the construction of the fully bunded fuel storage area during the rebuild (see Section 6.2.3). Even with the best precautions spills can still occur, and monitoring has shown that past minor leaks have caused local soil contamination.

Monitoring has been carried out of hydrocarbon concentrations in terrestrial soil samples from Berntsen Point, and also in seawater and marine sediment samples from Factory Cove (Figure 4). In 1992 and 1994, contaminated soil was found around the bulk fuel tank and other locations where fuel had been stored. The most heavily polluted soil sample was taken from site S6 which is immediately next to the station bulk fuel tank (total n-alkane concentration 4,353,799 μg kg-1 - 1994). Fuel leaks are not the only source of hydrocarbons in soils at Signy as terrestrial vegetation, particularly moss, is also a

significant input. Nevertheless, the results show that very high n-alkane concentrations in 
soils are a direct result of small local leaks from fuel tanks, pipelines and drums. Cripps 
(1992) found only very low-level petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination of seawater and 
marine sediments in Factory Cove, with pollution being confined to within a few hundred 
metres of the station. Total n-alkane concentrations in seawater decreased from 7.6 to 
2.6 μg l−1 within 500 m of the station, and in marine surface sediments concentrations 
decreased from 2081 to 451 μg kg−1 within 375 m. The biological effects of minor fuel 
spills or leaks at Berntsen Point or in Factory Cove are expected to be minimal.

5.3.5 Human values

Unused buildings and facilities will be removed at a future date. Until then, the BAS will 
carry out basic building maintenance in compliance with UK health and safety 
requirements for unoccupied premises.

The operation of the summer research station will involve the import and export of all 
contents, including fuel, each year.

Freshwater scientific research at Signy will be greatly enhanced by the new summer 
facility as it will enable new and more complex science to be undertaken. Other planned 
scientific research will be the CCAMLR monitoring programme.

The new living and laboratory building will be single storey and have only a minor visual 
impact. The redevelopment will therefore have only a local impact on wilderness values.

5.4 Cumulative impacts in the light of existing and known planned activities

Cumulative impacts will be very limited due to the seasonal operation of the station and 
the large reduction in the number of people on site. During the summer, footpaths will 
continue to be used, and low volumes of sewage and grey water and exhaust gases will be 
released into the environment (see Section 5.3). Accidental, minor fuel spills may occur.

6. MINIMISING AND MITIGATING IMPACTS

6.1 Construction activities

6.1.1 Development planning

The BAS established a Signy Redevelopment Working Group in 1993 with the overall 
purpose of establishing a comprehensive Statement Of Requirement (SOR) for the new 
facility. The BAS Environmental Officer was a member of the Working Group and 
ensured that the provisions of the Environmental Protocol, particularly as regards waste 
disposal, were clearly incorporated into the SOR.

section containing environmental requirements supplied by the BAS Environmental Officer 
(Appendix 1). The contractor has accepted all the environmental safeguards contained in 
this specification, and will comply fully with the Environmental Protocol.

6.1.3 Environmental education

The BAS policy of briefing all new recruits and visiting scientists on environmental and 
waste management before they travel to Antarctica has been extended to the staff 
employed by the contractor. All personnel are given a copy of the Antarctic Treaty 
Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic (ATCM Recommendation XVIII-1). At Signy, a 
further briefing on environmental and waste management on-site will be given by the 
Station Commander.

6.1.4 Prohibited areas

To minimise ground disturbance from construction activities, the contractor will be 
prohibited from working outside of the main station area (Zone A in Figure 2). All earth 
moving, trenching and site preparation will be carried out within areas already artificially 
levelled during past building and construction work. There will be no impact on the moss 
banks adjacent to the station.

6.1.5 Waste management

It is the BAS policy that all waste from Signy station, other than sewage, wet food waste 
and grey water should be removed from Antarctica. Waste management procedures 
currently used at Signy are outlined in the BAS Waste Management Handbook (Shears, 
1993). The contractor will comply with the BAS waste policy and procedures.

6.2 Operational activities

6.2.1 Station management and maintenance plan

A management and maintenance plan will be produced by the BAS for Signy Research 
Station and will include:

i)     a framework for the future operation and development of Signy Research Station;
ii)    a schedule to ensure that all facilities and services, including unused buildings, are 
maintained to appropriate standards.

6.2.2 Seawater pollution

Monitoring of seawater and sediments in Factory Cove has shown that the impact of 
sewage effluent produced by the present station is minimal (see Section 5.2.2). The BAS 
has therefore decided that treatment of effluent from the new, smaller summer-only facility 
is not necessary. Toilets will use salt water flushes, and sewage will be discharged without 
maceration. Food waste will continue to be macerated. As at present, hazardous laboratory 
chemicals will be kept in a specially designed store and any hazardous waste removed 
from Antarctica for safe disposal in the UK.

−20−
6.2.3 Fuel spills

The risk of a fuel spill occurring at Signy is small, and will be reduced further as new 
precautions will be put in place during the rebuild. The improvements to be made are:

i)      the present bulk fuel tank will be shut down and replaced by a new fuel storage 
        area which will be fully bunded and valved off;
ii)     the present pipelines, pipework, valves and supports will be completely replaced.

The present bulk fuel tank, pipelines and emergency pillow tanks will be drained and any 
fuel removed before the new summer station becomes operational. Fuel will not remain on 
site when the new facility is unoccupied in winter.

The BAS has already put in place the following oil spill response measures at Signy:

i)      production of the Signy Oil Spill Contingency Plan (Shears, 1993);
ii)     on-site oil spill response equipment, materials and safety clothing;
iii)    training in oil spill response for the Base Commander.

Regular oil spill response exercises have been held at Signy since the 1993/94 season.

7. ASSESSMENT AND VERIFICATION OF IMPACTS

7.1 Environmental monitoring

The key environmental indicators that are currently being monitored at Signy are:

i)      heavy metal and sulphur accumulation in lichens;
ii)     heavy metal concentrations in seawater, marine sediments and marine bivalves;
iii)    hydrocarbon concentrations in soils, seawater and marine sediments.

In addition, records are made of the following parameters:

i)      types and amounts of waste removed for disposal in the Falkland Islands or UK;
ii)     fuel spills and clean-up response.

The monitoring programme will continue during and after the redevelopment.

7.2 Environmental inspection and audit

The BAS Environmental Officers visited Signy Research Station in February 1994 to carry 
out a biological site survey of the station area, Berntsen Point and Waterpipe Beach before 
development of the new facility began. A full environmental inspection of the new facility 
will be carried out by a BAS Environmental Officer during the 1995/96 season.

An environmental audit of Signy Research Station will be carried out by the BAS within 
five years of the completion of the redevelopment. The audit will be coordinated by the
−21−
BAS Environmental Officer. The objectives of the audit will be to examine whether:

i)     the predictions contained in this IEE were accurate;
ii)    if any unforeseen impacts occurred during the construction of the summer only 
       station, and removal of unused buildings;
iii)   the mitigation measures and monitoring studies recommended in this IEE were 
       effective.

8. CONCLUSION

This Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) indicates that the redevelopment of Signy 
Research Station is likely to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the 
Antarctic environment, provided the recommended mitigation measures are carried out. It 
is therefore considered that a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) need not be 
prepared.

APPENDIX 1

Environmental requirements included in the tender specification for the
redevelopment of Signy Research Station

1. Environmental legislation and guidelines to be followed

The contractor and all employees shall be aware of and shall comply with:

i)      The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and its Annexes
        dealing with:

        -       Environmental Impact Assessment;
        -       Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora;
        -       Waste Disposal and Waste Management;
        -       Prevention of Marine Pollution;
        -       Area Protection and Management.

ii)     Guidelines prepared to protect the Antarctic environment:

        -       Antarctic Treaty Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic;
        -       BAS Waste Management Handbook;
        -       Signy Oil Spill Contingency Plan;
        -       Procedures which may be established by the Environmental Officer or Base
                Commander to minimize or mitigate environmental impacts related to the
                activity.

2. Environmental Impact Assessment

The contractor must ensure that the project is planned and conducted so as to limit adverse
impacts on the Antarctic environment.

3. Protection of Antarctic fauna and flora

The contractor must not disturb, harass or interfere with wildlife, or allow plants to be
damaged or destroyed. Firearms and weapons are prohibited and no hunting, trapping or
killing of birds or animals is permitted. The contractor must not introduce plants or
animals to Antarctica. All equipment and plant must be cleaned, preferably by steam-
cleaning, by the contractor before despatch to Antarctica.

4. Waste disposal and management

The contractor is to ensure that none of the following products, listed in Annex III of the
Protocol, are imported to the Antarctic:

        -       Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);
        -       Non-sterile soil;
        -       Polystyrene beads, chips or similar forms of man-made packaging;
        -       Pesticides.

−25−
The use of PVC products, especially plastic PVC packaging, should be avoided.

It is BAS policy that all waste from Signy station, other than sewage or domestic waste, 
should be removed from Antarctica. The contractor must comply with the waste 
management procedures developed at Signy which are described in the BAS Waste 
Management Handbook.

The contractor is required to sort, pack and label wastes produced by the project. The BAS 
will undertake the removal of the contractor's waste from Antarctica. Disposal costs for 
this waste will be passed onto the contractor. The contractor will be expected to help in 
the loading of waste at Signy. The contractor is to ensure work areas at Signy are kept 
tidy and free of loose rubbish at all times. The burning of waste by the contractor is 
prohibited.

The contractor is to ensure that there is a final clean-up of the site upon completion of 
works. The clean-up must be completed to the satisfaction of the BAS Environmental 
Officer.

5. The prevention of pollution

The contractor is prohibited from intentionally discharging fuel or hazardous chemicals 
into the Antarctic environment, unless the safety of personnel, ships, aircraft or equipment 
and facilities of high value are at risk.

The contractor must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that fuel is not spilled during 
the project. Should the contractor cause a spill of fuel or other hazardous chemical, the 
contractor is required, if at all practical, to stop further spillage and carry out an immediate 
clean-up. Personnel must be adequately trained to deal with such emergencies. The BAS 
must be informed of the incident as soon as possible. Any clean-up must be completed to 
the satisfaction of the BAS Environmental Officer. Any recovered fuel or material 
contaminated by fuel will be removed from Antarctica by BAS. Disposal costs for this 
waste will be passed onto the contractor.

6. Area protection

The contractor must ensure that employees do not enter any protected area in the 
Antarctic, in particular Moe and Lynch islands in the vicinity of Signy Island.
