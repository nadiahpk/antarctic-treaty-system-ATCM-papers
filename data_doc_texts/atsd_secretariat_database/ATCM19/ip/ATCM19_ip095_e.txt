OPENING ADDRESS BY MR STUART PRIOR
HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF NEW ZEALAND

Mr Chairman

Congratulations on your election to Chair this nineteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Through you Mr Chairman, may I thank the Government of the Republic of Korea for the opportunity to meet in Seoul.

Mr Chairman, I am delighted to report that on 22 December 1994 New Zealand became the 12th Consultative Party to ratify the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. At the same time, the New Zealand Government introduced domestic enabling legislation to give effect to the Protocol in New Zealand law. This legislation came into effect on 1 February 1995.

The reality of the Protocol entering into force sooner rather than later is becoming increasingly clear. It is also clear that we will need institutional structures in place before this happens. Much also remains to be done in developing the practical processes needed to put the Protocol into practice. While we welcomed the creation of the Transitional Environmental Working Group (TEWG) as a first step in this direction (and to the establishment of the Committee on Environmental Protection), we would like to see continued progress made on the practical and technical issues involved in the implementation of the Protocol.

The signature of the Protocol by each and every Consultative Party was an historic achievement. We achieved consensus on binding legal rules under which the Antarctic environment will be protected. The task now is for us to work together to bring the Protocol into force internationally. We need to make the Protocol work in practice and to embody our obligations to protect the Antarctic environment in effective national legislation. New Zealand has an explicit commitment to this process. We hope that the remaining parties yet to ratify will consider this a priority and take steps to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible.

We would also like to see a similar commitment by parties to make progress on other issues, such as the location of the Secretariat. New Zealand attaches high importance to the prompt and successful resolution of this problem. We would also like to see the momentum for the development of a Liability Annex maintained after this meeting.
Since ATCM XVIII, New Zealand has been active in meeting its responsibilities with regard to protected area management. The Christchurch based independent organisation, the International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research (ICAIR) has been commissioned to complete the management plan revisions required under Annex V of the Protocol for New Zealand. The first of these plans, for the Tramway Ridge area, has been submitted by New Zealand for approval by parties. The plan was produced using the most up-to-date GIS technology. The services and expertise provided by ICAIR in this field might prove to be of assistance to other parties.

A subject of particular interest to New Zealand is tourism and non-governmental activity in Antarctica. As a "Gateway" to Antarctica, we have closely followed the development of tourism in Antarctica. We welcomed the agreement at ATCM XVIII to provide guidelines for tourists and tour operators as a significant step in managing these activities. For the first time, a New Zealand-based tour operator commenced operations in the Ross Sea region. An Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared for this and the document circulated as an Information Paper for the interest of delegates.

We believe that information about tourism activity in Antarctica must be shared widely and that parties should co-operate as much as possible, through information exchanges with their programme operators and tourist operators. The basis of this is contained in Recommendation XVIII-1, but an internationally standardised means for data collection has yet to be agreed. ICAIR has consulted widely in the process of developing a prototype standard form for data collection by tour operators. New Zealand believes that this information is needed for effective coordination, monitoring and management of tourism and Non-government activities in Antarctica. This initiative has been supported by Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and together we will be deawing to the attention of Parties the progress that has been achieved to date.

International co-operation lies at the heart of the Antarctic Treaty system. Since our last meeting, New Zealand has continued its traditional scientific and operational co-operation with countries working in the Ross sea region. An Agreement encouraging more Antarctic scientific collaboration between New Zealand and France was signed last year. The Agreement records the commitment of both countries to the Environmental Protocol and to the protection of the Antarctic environment. A Joint Statement on Antarctic Scientific Cooperation was signed with Switzerland and a similar statement is in prospect with South Africa.

New Zealand was very pleased to assist with the welcome return to consensus on the Question of Antarctica in the United Nations General Assembly. The Question of Antarctica has been a long standing concern for Treaty parties. New Zealand hopes that the Treaty, its system and particularly the Protocol, will attract greater involvement by countries within the Asia/Pacific region. New Zealand is actively working with its neighbours and friends in this region to
increase knowledge and awareness of the Antarctic Treaty and to explore 
prospects for scientific collaboration in Antarctica.

Mr Chairman,

It is against this background of mutual co-operation and assistance that we 
meet again to continue working through the issues and challenges presented 
by the Protocol. The spirit of consensus has marked the development of the 
Treaty system since its inception and we are confident that with Parties' 
commitment to this long tradition we can make good progress on the issues 
before us.

Thank you Mr Chairman
