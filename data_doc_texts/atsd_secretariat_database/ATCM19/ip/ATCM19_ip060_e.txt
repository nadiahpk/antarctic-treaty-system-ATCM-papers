BELGIAN SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME ON THE ANTARCTIC - OSTC

1 INTRODUCTION

The Belgian Scientific Research Programme on the Antarctic was initiated in 1985 
by the Council of Ministers with a view to giving tangible form to Belgium's 
commitment towards the strengthening of the scientific knowledge of the area 
covered by the Antarctic Treaty. The programme is funded, managed and co-
ordinated by the Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs 
(formerly the Science Policy Office). The money allocated to the two first phases 
of the programme, i.e. 1985-88 and 1988-92, was 92 and 96 million BEF 
respectively. The budget of the current phase, namely 1992-95, amounts to 126 
million BEF. Research-work is implemented by means of 3-years projects 
undertaken by university-based scientists. All research costs (personnel, equipment, 
travel, working and overheads) are financed by OSTC.

Such research effort aims at contributing to the development of the knowledge 
required for a science-based conservation and management of the Antarctic 
environment and to the assessment of the mechanisms through which the Antarctic 
and the global climate interact. Emphasis is given on a multi-disciplinary approach 
of the dynamics of the global functioning of Antarctic main natural systems and of 
their evolution and interactions. The programme comprises seven research lines 
under three priority areas. They are:

• ECODYNAMICS OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE CLIMATE:
  o Biogeochemical fluxes and cycles in the main trophic 
    compartments
  o Modelling the global dynamics of ecosystems
  o Assessment of the role of "new production" in the burial of 
    atmospheric CO_(2) by the Southern Ocean

• EVOLUTION AND PROTECTION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS:
  o Application of predictive ecological models to simulate 
    ecosystem responses to man-made climatic disturbances
  o Study of hydrocarbons spills dispersion

• ROLE OF THE ANTARCTIC IN GLOBAL CHANGES:
  o Ocean-Cryosphere-Atmosphere interactions.
  o Sedimentary palaeoenvironment.

The following section gives an overview of the mid-term results of the research 
projects financed under Phase III of the Programme.

SPATIAL AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY OF BIOGENIC ELEMENTAL TRANSPORT IN THE
SOUTHERN OCEAN:

The distribution and uptake of nitrogenous nutrients have been
analyzed The nitrogen signature of marginal ice zones in the
Southern Ocean often departs from the "classical" Antarctic
nutrient profiles of high nitrate and low ammonium values in
the surface. In the Weddell Sea marginal ice zones often show
enhanced nitrate depletions, amounting to > 800 mmolN/m . 
Ammonium stocks in the upper layer can be up to 7% of the
inorganic nitrogen pool

ROLE OF THE MEIOBENTHOS IN ANTARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS:

The role of meiofauna in two different habitats in the Antarc-
tic marine ecosystem (e.g. deep sea and shallow subtidal) was
questioned.

For the deep-sea study a total of 18 stations were sampled.
They were located in the Weddell Sea, in the region off Kapp
Norvegia (71-72°S, 12-13°W) and Halley Bay (74-75°S, 25-30°W),
at a depth varying from 211 to 2,080 m. Total meiofauna
abundance ranged from 790 to 5,120 individuals per 10 cm ,
total biomass from 0.09 to 0.97 mg dwt per 10 cm . Although 28
taxa were found, the meiofauna consisted mainly of nematodes
(up to 97 %), followed by harpacticoid copepods, polychaetes
and kinorhynchs. Length-frequency distributions of the
nematodes were generally skewed to the left with most animals
belonging to the 0.4-0.6 mm size-class. The widely accepted
deeper-longer relation, known from vertical distribution
studies of marine nematodes in the sediment, could be extended
to most communities of the Antarctic waters off Kapp Norvegia.
An attempt was made to estimate meiofauna production. Using two
Production/Biomass ratios known from nematode production in
temperate regions (e.g. P/B = 4 and 69), the annual production
in the Weddell Sea varied between 0.47 and 12.96 gC/m /y. The
validity of this method was discussed. The structure of the
meiofauna community was positively correlated with grain size,
organic matter and microbiota in the sediment. Total density
and biomass showed different distributions along the sediment
depth gradient. From multivariate analysis it was concluded the
two regions in the Weddell Sea do not markedly differ. Depth
and sediment grain size were the most important structuring
factors.

The shallow subtidal study was carried out at Signy (60°42'S,
45°36'W). In this respect, meiobenthos was sampled forthnightly
over a period of 18 months. The impact of the seasonal vari-
ation of different nutritive sources (e.g. chlorophyll,
bacteria, organic matter) on the meiobenthic communities was
followed. Total density ranged between 2,000 and 20,000
individuals per 10 cm
Biomass showed a similar, though less pronounced trend. The
genus composition of the nematodes showed no seasonal influence
yet, but further taxonomic investigation is necessary. A first
attempt was made to follow respiration rates of the meiofauna
in the sediments of Signy Island.


Although the deep-sea fauna has been studied very intensively,
only little is known about meiofauna on the continental shelves
and slopes. In this context the meiobenthic exploration of the
deep sea surrounding Antarctica has been described for the
first time. Densities and biomasses of Antarctic deep-sea
meiofauna were shown to be comparable with values from the
northeast Atlantic.

CONTROL OF THE ANTARCTIC PELAGIC ECOSYSTEM BY HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS IN
RELATION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES :


A 1-D model of the water column with a k-l turbulent closure
has been applied to the study of interactions between sea-ice
and ocean and their influence on planktonic communities. The
sea-ice model is the one proposed by Semtner (1976), but with
a parameterization of leads. Special attention was paid to: (1)
the sharing of energy between lateral and basal melting; (2)
melting induces persistent shallow mixing layer thus favouring
primary production; (3) the absence of ice nearly forbids
blooming;  (4) the modification of biological parameters
(maximum production rate or I
k
) can have important consequences
on biomasses; and, (5) the lesser sensitiveness of results to
initial conditions of zooplankton than of phytoplankton.


Planktonic data (HPLC pigments, zooplankton, krill) and samples
obtained during ITALIANTARTIDE cruises were used to parametrize
and calibrate a model of the secondary planktonic levels in the
Ross Sea. A preliminary coupling between 1-D physical and a
ecological model has been achieved which includes explicitly
the effect of vertical turbulence on biological processes. Data
on phytopigments and degradation products were used as tracers
along the food chain. Pigments distribution was investigated in
conncection with: (i) distribution, structure and composition
of meso-zooplankton communities; (ii) vertical repartition of
trophic levels; and, (iii) krill patchiness.


Hydrodynamical data confirmed the importance of physical
processes within the circumpolar marginal ice zone in regulat-
ing the Ross Sea pelagic food chain. In the Ross Sea, the ice
free surface propagates from S to N. The wind and superficial


1994 PROGRESS REPORT                                                                               3
circulation are responsible for the accumulation of algae 
containing ices in coastal area. The control of phytoplankton 
by herbivores in the mixed layer is characteristic of the Ross 
Sea: krill (Euphausia superba) outside the shelf, pelagic 
pteropods (Limacina helicina) in coastal ice edge or 
mesozooplanktonic copepods (Calanus propinquus) in the shelf 
ice-free zone. In the shelf area, omnivorous organisms below 
the pycnocline are heavily feeding on fecal pellets: amphipods 
in coastal zone and copepods (Metridia gerlachei) offshore. The 
diversity of pattern of planktonic vertical profiles seems due 
to constraints such as macroscale water masses distribution 
associated to frontal systems, ice coverage and vertical 
structuration of the water column, rather than to ecosystem 
diversity. The ice edge melting occurs sooner in the central 
and southern Ross Sea. Also, areas shallower than 500 m seems 
to be inaccessible to krill which strongly influences the 
utilisation of primary production. Finally, the W Ross Sea is 
richer in phytoplankton than the E one, probably because of the 
different ice algae content of the ice pack.

Nutrients, phytoplankton size-fractionated Chl.a, 
photosynthetic pigments (by HPLC) and primary production were 
studied during the 1991 austral summer in the Strait of 
Magellan in relation to meteorological and hydrodynamical 
constraints and runoff/land forcing. Chl.a, nutrients and 
primary production showed uneven but similar distributions, 
allowing the characterization of different sectors each showing 
distinct hydrographic typologies: an oligotrophic, wind-mixed 
coastal area, adjacent to the Pacific opening; a high runoff 
fjord and a divergence zone in the Andean sectors; a stratified 
inland sea in the basin-like part of the channel in the 
Patagonian sectors. Global features of the channel were the 
confinement of the microphytoplankton fraction to the external 
areas and the uniform structure of phytoplankton communities < 
5 μm within the internal ones. Phytoplankton biomass (active 
Chl.a) was 10–51 mg/m^(2) and primary production 275–1,170 
mgC/m^(2)/d. Nitrates were never exhausted. The assemblage of 
plant pigments indicated that the high levels of phytoplankton 
pigments and production were attributable to Chlorophytes, 
Prasinophytes, Prymnesiophytes and/or Gyrodinium and 
Gymnodinium-like dinoflagellates that were submitted to 
superfluous feeding activity. When diatoms, Cryptomonads and 
Prymnesiophytes were dominant, efficient zooplankton grazing 
occurred and characterized a balanced food chain.

RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES :

Biomass of auto- and heterotrophic microorganisms (nano- and 
net-sized phytoplankton; bacteria and 3 key taxons of nanoprot-
ozooplankton) and their feeding activities (phytoplankton 
photosynthesis and growth; protozoan feeding on bacteria and 
autotrophic flagellates) were regularly measured during the 
early spring (Sept.29th-Nov.29th 1992) SO-JGOFS ANT X/6 polar 
expedition on board of the R/V Polarstern in the Atlantic 
sector of the Southern Ocean. In particular the technique of 
fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) and autotrophic flagel-
lates (FLB) for measuring bactivorous and herbivorous 
nanoprotozoan grazing was successfully applied for the first 
time in the Southern Ocean.

Transects were repeatedly worked along the 6°W meridian, from 
the ice-covered Weddell Sea, across the Southern Antarctic 
Circumpolar Current (ACC) and into the Polar Frontal Zone. 
During that cruise, meteorological conditions were severe and 
no bloom of any significance was recorded in the vicinity of 
the ice-edge. Maximum phytoplanktonic biomasses were recorded 
in the Polar Frontal zone. The analysis of the microbial 
network, as based on microscopic observations, revealed the 
occurrence of two different trophic webs with respect to the 
water masses: a diatom-mesozooplankton-dominant food-web in the 
Polar Front area; an active microbial food-web, composed of 
autotrophic flagellates, bacteria, and nanoprotzoa at the 
receeding ice-edge. Budget calculations based on comparison of 
daily auto- and heterotrophic activities indicate, however, 
that the control of nanophytoplankton and bacteria development 
by nanoprotzooplankton was of little significance in early 
spring.

Theoretical considerations on the physical processes governing 
vertical stability of marginal ice zone surface layers on the 
one hand and mathematical simulations with the one-dimensional 
coupled physical-biological SWAMCO model of Lancelot et al. 
(1993), forced by either the moderate or the extremely windy 
weather conditions experienced during the Polarstern marginal 
ice zone expeditions EPOS and ANT X/6 on the other hand, evi-
dence, in accordance with observations, the tight coupling 
between atmospheric forcing - most notable in the frequency, 
duration and strength of storm events - and ice-edge 
phytoplankton bloom occurrence. In particular it is demon-
strated that the windy meteorological conditions prevailing 
during the ANT X/6 expedition prevented blooms from developing. 
This implies that primary production associated to the 
circumpolar marginal ice zone of the Southern Ocean should be 
predicted to the same extent as weather can be predicted in 
these extreme latitudes provided the ice-covered superficie is 
known and biological controls evidenced in the studied sector 
hold for the whole circumpolar marginal ice zone.

       OIL SPILL MODELLING FOR THE ANTARCTIC SEAS (OSMAS):

The danger of oil pollution in the Antarctic has been growing 
proportionally to human presence and activities, and to shipping 
in the area. The nature of the coastline, the presence of the 
ice pack and the sensitivity of the biological community explain 
the very high vulnerability of the Antarctic ecosystem to oil 
pollution. It seems thus necessary to develop adequate models 
able to predict the evolution of an oil slick in such an 
environment in order to assist in counter-pollution operations 
and in impact assessment studies.

This research work aims at developing a methodology for 
predicting the drift and spreading of oil spills in cold and 
ice-infested waters. We place emphasis on the physical behav-
iour, rather than the chemical fate of oil and try to adapt and 
link three models previously developed at MUMM (a circulation 
model, a sea ice model and an oil spill model in open seas) and 
empirical methods used to determine the spread of oil in 
ice-infested waters. The models mentioned above are shortly 
described. More emphasis is placed on the behaviour of oil on 
cold water and the physical interaction between oil and ice. 
The main influences of ice on oil behaviour are identified on 
basis of the (limited) available data.

This work is an important step before simulating the evolution 
of a spill at the sea surface, in the water column and in the 
ice, over a seasonal cycle, which is the goal of the present 
research.

A continuous formula proposed by Maykut to compute the ice 
albedo has been implemented in the SEAICE model.

The wind drift factor and the deflection angle used to compute 
the ice pack drift have been adopted according to the results 
of recent studies carried out in the Weddell Sea. These 
modifications have improved the agreement between the computed 
seasonal cycle of ice extent and the observations.

Tests have been carried out to incorporate the density effects 
in the 3D hydrodynamic model available at the beginning of this 
project. Problems, linked to the computation of the pressure 
gradient in sigma coordinates, have been encountered. Different 
techniques, recently proposed in the literature, have been 
investigated but none of them completely eliminate the error.

The spreading equation of the MUSLICK model [Scory, 1991] has

1994 PROGRESS REPORT                                                          6
been corrected to be applicable to cold water conditions. The 
equation is now able to reproduce the considerably reduced area 
of an oil slick on cold water. The strong influence of oil 
viscosity has been pointed out. The evolution equation has then 
been used to study the interaction between oil and ice. The 
previous study on the same topic [El-Tahan et al., 1988] used 
Fay's theory which considers that an oil slick evolutes 
according to three phases characterized by an equilibrium 
between forces acting on the oil slick (inertia/gravity, 
gravity/viscous and viscous/surface). Our spreading equation 
gathers all these forces and includes Fay's theory: the 
contribution of each force in the equation varies with time.

Finally, the parameters of the transport equation of the oil 
slick have been adapted to take into account the presence of 
ice.

FORMATION OF THE TERRA NOVA BAY POLYNIA AND CLIMATIC IMPLICATIONS:

The 3-D Atmospheric Mesoscale Circulation Model (MAR) has been 
improved by including a more detailed this scheme for the 
representation of atmospheric turbulence. Sensitivity tests to 
this scheme have been performed and show that the katabatic 
wind speed is improved by 5 to 10%. This is not enough compar-
ing with the observations and suggests that other processes not 
represented in the simulations have also to be tested [synoptic 
scale forcing, blowing snow process, see Gallée and Schayes, 
1994]. Nevertheless the relative small sensitivity to the 
representation of turbulence, as it is found in the present 
paper, indicates that these schemes are sufficiently realistic 
for simulating katabatic winds.

The atmospheric model has also been coupled to a wind-forced

polynya model, generalized from that of Ou [1988], by including 
drifts varying in space and time. The second horizontal dimen-
sion is also taken into account and the polynya model is 
discretized as MAR. Several assumptions generally done in the 
Ou [1988] model remain and are discussed here: (i) the sea-ice 
dynamics are not included, and the ice drift speed is that of 
the sea-ice edge; in the case of katabatic winds, which 
offshore extent is limited, this could lead to an 
overestimation of the ice drift speed and consequently of the 
polynya extent; another consequence of the non inclusion of 
sea-ice dynamics is that small leads are not allowed to form in 
the model; (ii) the accretion process is also poorly repre-
sented in the model; for the Terra Nova Bay area, a value of 22 
cm has been chosen for the frazil collection thickness; 
however, this assumption does not seem to be critical, as it 
has been found in preliminary sensitivity experiments (not 
shown) to the value of the collection thickness; (iii) the 
oceanic current is not taken into account; this is a good 
approximation for the Terra Nova Bay area as far as the polynya 
extent is smaller that the length of the Drygalski Ice Tongue; 
a next generalization of the model should be to include the 
oceanic current in order to allow operational forecast for 
example; (iv) although the turbulent heat fluxes are well 
represented in the model, it is possible that secondary 
processes like evaporation from drops entrained in the atmos-
phere by the wind may be important; (v) the hydrological cycle 
is not switched on in the simulations presented in this paper; 
it is recognized that for air temperatures below −20°C, an ice 
fog forms as warm moist surface air mixes upward and cools; 
this could have an influence on the radiative transfer and 
consequently modify the polynya surface energy balance; further 
tests have to be performed with the model in order to examine 
this possibility.

Despite the above mentioned assumptions, the coupled 
atmosphere-polynya model allows to take into account in an 
interactive way the polynya impact on ocean-atmosphere-ice 
interactions in the antarctic coastal zone. Encouraging results 
are obtained: in particular the model seems to represent accu-
rately the Terra Nova Bay polynya. The atmospheric model simu-
lates realistic katabatic winds over the polynya, simulated 
winds are probably in closer agreement with the observations 
than over the ice sheet. It is the first time that a meso-γ 
scale atmospheric model is coupled to a wind-forced polynya 
model. The Terra Nova Bay polynya is well represented by this 
model and constitutes an important component in the 
ocean-atmosphere-ice interactions in Terra Nova. It was also 
found that the atmospheric circulation in Terra Nova Bay is 
significantly influenced by the presence of an open (warm) 
water area. A breeze effect results and increases the katabatic 
wind speed when it passes the coastline. On the contrary, the 
breeze effect which is also present at the downwind edge of the 
polynya acts in the opposite way there and the katabatic wind 
is stopped.

Because of the strong mesoscale heat fluxes generated by the 
Terra Nova Bay polynya, its climatic impact could be important. 
Despite this fact, the size of this polynya is not large enough 
to be represented into a GCM. For this reason its effects could 
be parameterized and the parameterization may be developed 
using a coupled atmosphere-polynya model. Other possible 
applications of the coupled atmosphere-polynya model are numer-
ous. It has been found that the model is not only able to 
simulate the Terra Nova Bay polynya but other observed polynyas 
like that existing along the north-western part of the Ross Ice 
Shelf. An application should be to evaluate with the model the 
formation of wind forced polynyas everywhere along the antarc-
tic coast. Moreover, such model could be of considerable 
interest to operational meteorologists. Indeed, polynyas fore-
casting is important for the navigation. Polynyas are strongly 
dependant of the wind field and in turn influences local 
weather [e.g. Anderson, 1993].

3 FIELD ACTIVITIES

Field activities i.e., at sea sampling and measurements, are being achieved in the 
framework of scientific voyages to the Antarctic organized by other countries.

Through their involvement in such campaigns, the research teams of the 
Programme were also provided with the unique opporunity to develop or strenght 
international co-operation links. As an outcome, most of the Programme's research 
projects are increasingly contributing to, and taking advantage of, the common 
implementation of internationally integrated studies.
