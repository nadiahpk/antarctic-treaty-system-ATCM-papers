Agenda Item 3
OPENING ADDRESS
OF UNITED STATES DELEGATION

My delegation wishes to express its deep appreciation to the 
Government of Korea for providing such excellent facilities and 
for the hospitality of the City of Seoul.

We look forward to significant progress on many important items 
on the agenda. We continue to believe that the early entry into 
force of the Protocol for Environmental Protection of Antarctica 
is the highest priority of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Parties. We note, as depository country, that 16 of the 26 
parties have so far ratified the Protocol. We want to emphasize 
that the establishment of a modest secretariat is essential to 
assist the functioning of the Protocol and the Antarctic Treaty 
System in general and that it should begin operation by the time 
the Protocol enters into force. We would encourage the 
participation of experts from the scientific, technical, and 
conservation community.

Recalling that Antarctica is a continent dedicated to science as 
well as environmental protection, we are pleased to note the 
impressive progress being made in many areas of research. 
Antarctica is again proving itself a natural laboratory 
providing significant new evidence of global change and of the 
interrelationship of glaciological, biological, geological, 
meteorological, and oceanographic processes manifesting these 
changes. Antarctica is also proving to be a very valuable site 
for astrophysical. Research there continues to be a model of 
international scientific cooperation.

We note the important work accomplished last week by the 
Transitional Environmental Working Group and the Working Group 
on the Liability Annex, and further note that these are 
significant contributions to the future operations of the 
Antarctic Treaty System. We must continue to distinguish between 
concrete steps we can take now and those that are only possible 
when the Protocol is finally in force.

We need to work toward stronger integration of the important work 
of CCAMLR, SCAR, and COMNAP within the Antarctic Treaty System. 
Progress can be made at this meeting in a variety of areas 
including tourism, environmental monitoring, and management and 
exchange of scientific data.

In conclusion, we reiterate our pleasure at being here in the 
very friendly city of Seoul and our commitment to cooperation to 
ensure the success of the meeting.
