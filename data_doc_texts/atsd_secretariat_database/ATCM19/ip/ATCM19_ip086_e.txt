Concerning the Situation at ARRIVAL HEIGHTS (SSSI NUMBER 2)

1   New Zealand and the United States wish to record their gratitude to the 
    Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and, in particular, to the 
    Chairman of the SCAR Working Group on Solar-Terrestrial and Astrophysical 
    Research acting on behalf of SCAR at meetings between representatives of 
    the New Zealand and United States National Committees concerning the 
    problems of electro-magnetic noise at SSSI Number 2.

2   We appreciate the assistance of SCAR over the past two years in 
    facilitating what has proved to be a most useful process of scientific 
    investigation into the sources and impacts of electro-magnetic noise affecting 
    SSSI Number 2.

3   New Zealand and the United States have taken careful note of the 
    findings of the report adopted by SCAR and of the consequent SCAR 
    Recommendation XXIII-6, as noted in XIX ATCM INFO 57.

4   They would like to note that, although SCAR Recommendation XXVIII-6 
    does not appear to be feasible in light of the existence of Scott Base and 
    McMurdo Station, they intend to take note of the Recommendation in planning 
    their activities on Ross Island. At the same time, they wish to advise that, the 
    New Zealand SCAR Committee is working with the US SCAR Committee to 
    establish contact points in each country's science community. Their role will 
    be to ensure the review of any proposals for new scientific or support facilities 
    in the area with respect to minimising electromagnetic interference.
