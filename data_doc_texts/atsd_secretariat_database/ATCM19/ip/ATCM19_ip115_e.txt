OPENING ADDRESS
BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM

Mr. Chairman,

1.      May I, on behalf of the UK delegation, thank the Government of the Republic of Korea
for hosting this XIXth ATCM. We look forward to constructive discussions as to how we can
improve the effectiveness of our work, and in particular the effective implementation of the
Environmental Protocol.

2.      During the past twelve months the United Kingdom was amongst those Parties who
ratified the Environmental Protocol. But we note that a few States have yet to give effect to the
obligations of the Protocol in their domestic law.  We hope that this will be addressed as a
matter of some priority. The United Kingdom will present at this meeting papers which draw
on our own legislative experiences.  In addition, we will circulate guidelines on how,
domestically, we intend to address the important issue of Environmental Impact Assessment.
We hope that this sharing of our experience may assist other Consultative Parties.

3.      The United Kingdom indicated last year in Kyoto that a clear demonstration of a
cooperative approach by the Parties to the implementation of the obligations of the Protocol
would be through the formation of an interim body that would address the functions of the
2

Committee for Environmental Protocol. We were therefore encouraged that the XVIIIth ATCM saw fit to bring into being the Transitional Environmental Working Group. TEWG we see as 
the catalyst to getting the Protocol up and running. The United Kingdom intends to play an 
active part in that Working Group which we hope will pave the way for a smooth transition to 
the CEP once the Protocol has entered into force.

4. But although the CEP has a clear mandate, a defined agenda and a shopping list of 
responsibilities set out in Article 12 of the Protocol, the precise nature of how the TEWG will 
operate remains unresolved. We believe it important that the ATCM set out how it sees the 
Group functioning. Parties must, we believe, recognize the importance of a TEWG constituted 
with appropriately qualified representatives, and identify resources to enable it to function 
effectively.

5. The United Kingdom believes that environmental protection in Antarctica could be 
enhanced through standardisation. Our view is that in this respect the TEWG could consider 
model guidelines or formats to assist our work.

6. In March of this year the UK attended, along with representatives from 16 other 
Consultative Parties, the seminar in Ushuaia on the future of the Antarctic Treaty System. That 
meeting identified the need for greater clarity and orderliness to be injected into the future 
working of the ATCM.

7.     With this in mind, the United Kingdom has prepared, in conjunction with others, two 
Working Papers.  These propose changes both to the organization of the ATCM and to its 
decision-making processes.  The latter issue in particular we regard as crucial.

8.     The means by which the Parties have adopted, and subsequently approved, 
Recommendations under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty is clearly inefficient. We have for 
too long operated a practice whereby Recommendations become effective only after inordinate 
delay. We, along with our co-sponsors, will propose that a more effective way of operating 
would be to distinguish clearly between mandatory and hortatory decisions, and the means by 
which they should become effective.

9.     The United Kingdom will continue to play an active role in the discussions on an Annex 
on liability. We believe this to be an important issue deserving the most serious consideration 
by the group of legal experts. Our view is that it is important that the Annex, or Annexes, that 
are finally adopted are designed for the special conditions of Antarctica. With that in mind, the 
future involvement by experts, scientific; technical and logistic, in the Working Group is 
essential.

With these and other pressing matters in mind the United Kingdom delegation looks 
forward to a productive XIXth ATCM.
