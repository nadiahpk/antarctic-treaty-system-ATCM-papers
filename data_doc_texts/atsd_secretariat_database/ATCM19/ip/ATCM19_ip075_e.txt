SCAR INFORMATION PAPER TO XIX ATCM

Report on Global Change and the Antarctic

The Antarctic plays an important role in global change studies through major interactions between the atmosphere, ice, ocean and biota, affecting the entire global system due to feedbacks in bio-geochemical cycles, deep ocean circulation, atmospheric transport and changes in ice sheet mass balances. This has been recognized by the Antarctic Treaty and by SCAR. In 1991, SCAR sponsored a multi-disciplinary workshop to produce a regional agenda for Antarctic global change research (The Role of the Antarctic in Global Change: An International Plan for a Regional Research Programme). In addition, XXIII SCAR (1992) established the Group of Specialists on Global Change and the Antarctic (SCAR-GLOCHANT) with a remit to provide liaison and co-ordination between SCAR and the major international programmes on global change research and to plan and to implement a regional programme of global change research in the Antarctic.

SCAR-GLOCHANT initially established five Planning Groups to cover the following science areas: Sea Ice, Palaeoenvironmental Records, Ice Sheet Mass Balance, Atmospheric Chemistry and Biogeochemical Cycles, and two co-ordination groups for Data Management and Numerical Modelling. A major role of the Planning Groups has been to review on-going or planned Antarctic global change research and to identify key issues that are not currently being addressed.

The progress of GLOCHANT was reviewed at XXIII SCAR. Whilst recognizing the multi-disciplinary aspect of Antarctic global change research, SCAR Delegates expressed concern about the broad scale approach that GLOCHANT was adopting. Delegates recommended that GLOCHANT should adopt a more tightly focused approach, concentrating initially on those aspects in which SCAR has specific strengths and expertize, namely palaeoenvironmental records and ice sheet mass balance. This process of prioritization and refocusing was continued at the third meeting of GLOCHANT (April 1995).

The issue of the structures required to meet SCAR's revised remit was also considered at GLOCHANT-3. The Planning Groups that had already met and made recommendations on key areas of research have now been disbanded. The Planning Group on Atmospheric Chemistry will be disbanded once it has met and made its recommendations (July 1995). For those key issues that GLOCHANT decides are priorities, a series of focused task-teams will be set up to provide the planning and co-ordination structures required. These task-teams will have a limited life and a closely defined remit, and will be disbanded once their objectives have been met. The process of reviewing and prioritizing the key issues identified by the Planning Groups will be carried out at the fourth meeting of GLOCHANT (April 1996). GLOCHANT's role is to champion these key issues within the Antarctic scientific community and to encourage National Committees to develop or expand existing programmes or to join in collaborative research, thereby ensuring that research into key issues is carried out. GLOCHANT also has a role in providing a forum where a multi-disciplinary synthesis of results can take place.

SCAR has accepted an offer from the Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment in the University of Tasmania, Hobart, to provide the facilities for the SCAR Global Change Project Office. This will provide a focal point for co-ordination, communication and linkage for all aspects of Antarctic global change research, as well as a secretariat for GLOCHANT. A Project Officer has been appointed and will be in post shortly.
GLOCHANT has also developed linkages with the major international programmes on global 
change research:
- the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP)
- the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)
- the System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) Network.

START has agreed that GLOCHANT should provide the START Regional Research Network 
for the Antarctic. In addition, the START Secretariat and GLOCHANT will work together to 
produce a proposal for the implementation of a SCAR-START Antarctic Regional Research 
Centre, in time for discussion at XXIV SCAR (August 1996).
