INTERNATIONAL ANTARCTIC
SCIENTIFIC AND LOGISTIC COOPERATION

Agenda Item 14
(Submitted by New Zealand)
AGENDA ITEM 14 : INTERNATIONAL ANTARCTIC SCIENTIFIC AND 
LOGISTIC COOPERATION

New Zealand has continued to maintain an active programme of international 
scientific, logistic and operational co-operation with other countries working in the Ross 
Sea region.

Cooperation between the New Zealand and United States Antarctic programmes 
is the most extensive between any two Antarctic Treaty Parties and the most long-
lasting, based as it is on a Memorandum of Understanding which was signed in 1958. 
This co-operation is based largely on logistic support, particularly in flight and cargo 
operations to and from Christchurch and helicopter support on the Antarctic continent. 
Italy also contributed to this air support pool and together, the three countries jointly 
transported over 2,300 scientists and support staff to McMurdo Sound over the 1994-95 
season.

An Agreement on Antarctic Cooperation was signed between France and New 
Zealand on 16 September 1994. The Agreement encourages more scientific 
collaboration between New Zealand and Franch Antarctic agencies - both at the 
institutional and scientist-to-scientist level. The Agreement also gives a high priority to 
the Environmental Protocol and the need to protect the Antarctic environment. A Joint 
Statement on Antarctic Scientific Cooperation was signed with Switzerland on 28 
March 1995 and a similar statement is under negotiation with South Africa.

Collaborative research projects were carried out with the United States on ozone 
and Antarctic atmospheric work, and on the dynamics of Adelie penguin populations. A 
joint New Zealand/Australian programme collaborated with an Italian/British study on 
terrestrial plant performances. Scientists from Germany, Japan and Sweden also visited 
Scott Base and worked with New Zealand researchers.

The Cape Roberts Project, a major international project involving scientists from 
New Zealand, the USA, Britain, Germany and Italy to drill for cores under the Ross Sea, 
is now underway. Equipment and buildings for the site were off-loaded during the 
1994-95 season in preparation for the first drilling year which is expected to commence 
in the 1996-97 season. A CEE for this project was circulated at the XVIIIth ATCM.
