MEMORANDUM FOR THE PROLONGATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL

SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

THE ROSS SEA MARGINAL ICE ZONE ECOLOGY PROJECT (ROSSMIZE)

 
● In 1989 scientists of the Italian National Research Programme in Antarctic (PNRA) and the
Belgian Scientific Research Programme on the Antarctic started to conduct joint research work
in the field of marine ecology and biogeochemistry. Particular attention was paid to the
application of complementary methods and approaches, the free exchange of data and informa-
tion, the sharing of equipment, the exchange of scientists between countries, and the organisation
of workshops of data elaboration. Such collaborative research ultimately led to joint publications
in international journals.

 
● Building upon the common expertise and knowledge acquired in this way by the Department of
Marine Environmental Sciences (University of Genova) and the Ecohydrodynamics Unit
(University of Liège) an international project called ROSSMIZE (Ross Sea Marginal Ice Zone
Ecology) was elaborated in 1994. The project aims at strengthening our understanding of the
major physical, ecological and biogeochemical processes controlling the sedimentation in the
Ross Sea with special attention to the sea ice seasonal melting.

 
● The terms of reference of that new collaborative effort were stated in an agreement signed on
23 September 1994 by the Italian and Belgian entities involved
