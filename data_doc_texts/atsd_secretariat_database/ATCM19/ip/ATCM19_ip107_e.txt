XIX ATCM Agenda Item 17- GLOBAL CHANGE SCIENCE

Information paper submitted by Australia

Australian Antarctic Program: Global change science
In 1991 Australia's Antarctic Science Advisory Committee advised in its report
Antarctic Research Priorities for the 1990s: A Review that "Australia's Antarctic
research program should, in broad terms, be directed towards an
understanding of the nature and evolution of Antarctica and the Southern
Ocean and their role in our planet's environment..." This review was followed
in 1992 by the ASAC report Antarctic Science--The Way Forward, which
emphasised the need to relate Antarctic science to international environmental
priorities, and recommended to the Government that strategies be developed
for six key areas of Antarctic research:
  1 atmospheric sciences,
  2 biological sciences,
  3 glaciology,
  4 oceanography,
  5 geosciences and
  6 human impacts.
The Australian Government reviewed its Antarctic program in mid-1993,
taking account of the 1992 ASAC recommendations, and decided that the
program's four key goals would be understanding global change, protecting
the Antarctic environment, obtaining information of practical importance, and
maintaining the Antarctic Treaty system and Australia's influence in it.
In November 1994 the Australian Antarctic Division published ANARE
Strategic Plans 1995-2000, detailing strategies for each of the six program areas
listed under 3 above. Allocation of resources would give first priority to
- research of both scientific and practical importance that can only be
conducted in Antarctica, that relates primarily to studies of global and
regional change, marine ecosystem management and associated data
gathering; and
- research supporting management strategies for the region.

Australia's Antarctic research activities are now firmly based upon the
strategies and priorities outlined in ANARE Strategic Plans. In 199495 the
program in the Antarctic involves several activities with the potential to make a
major contribution to the understanding of global processes. They include:
- completion in February 1995 of a 4500 km two-way traverse of the
world's largest glacier, Lambert Glacier. The traverse collected data on
the dynamics of the Lambert ice stream and deployed automatic
weather stations in the remote East Antarctic interior. Preliminary
analysis of the traverse data indicates that the Lambert basin is out of
balance.
- continued analysis and dating of ice cores from Law Dome, East
Antarctica, involving study of volcanic events and other past indicators.
- completion in the 1994 austral spring of ship-based and aerial sea ice
observations and coring, and recovery of upward-looking sonar buoys
deployed in 1993. Core data suggest that there is a limit of 60 cm in the
thickness to which sea ice forms and that greater thickness is achieved 
only by rafting.
• investigations of the impact of ultraviolet-B radiation on bacteria in 
Vestfold Hills lakes, and use of new spectro-radiometer equipment for 
underwater UV-B measurements.
• installation of the first phase of climate change monitoring equipment at 
Davis.
• enhancement of the Australian tide-measuring program with 
installation of a new tide gauge at Commonwealth Bay, East Antarctica 
(with the assistance of the US Antarctic program) and pressure sensor 
equipment for the existing Macquarie Island tide gauge.

In 1994, the Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean 
Environment (Antarctic CRC) was selected by SCAR to host the secretariat of 
the GLOCHANT (Global Change in Antarctica) program. The Antarctic CRC is 
a joint venture between the Australian Antarctic Division, the Australian 
Geological Survey Organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology, the 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the 
University of Tasmania.
