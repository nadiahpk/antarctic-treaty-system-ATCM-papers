ANTARCTIC AND SOUTHERN OCEAN COALITION
GREEN LEGISLATION
FOR ANTARCTICA

This paper outlines the major principles
and a number of specific points
which Antarctic Treaty Parties
should include when drafting
national legislation to implement
the Protocol on Environmental Protection
to the Antarctic Treaty
(the Madrid Protocol)

This paper was written by ASOC
- The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition -
an international coalition of over 200 non governmental
organisations in 49 countries
dedicated to the conservation of Antarctica
ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS FOR 
MADRID PROTOCOL 
ENABLING LEGISLATION

1.      Many member states of the Antarctic Treaty will need to pass enabling legislation through national legislatures in order to complete the process of ratifying the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic (the Madrid Protocol). This paper sets out a number of principles and specific points that should be included in any such enabling legislation, in order to protect the Antarctic environment effectively.

2.      The Protocol and its Annexes should, in ASOC's view, be regarded as minimum standards, to be augmented and strengthened as required. This paper therefore includes in its last five sections a number of proposals for nations to adopt more protective measures than those directly stipulated in the Protocol.

3.      Much of what has been included in this paper has already been embodied either in enabling legislation already passed by several states or is included within current drafts.

A.      PRINCIPLES

4.      The environmental principles of the Protocol (Article 3 (2)) must be the over-riding and binding consideration for all activities in the Antarctic Treaty area.

5.      It is therefore essential that these principles be included verbatim in the substantive provisions of the legislation in order to ensure that they are binding.

6.      Similarly, the firm obligations laid down in Article 3(4) (b) of the Protocol to modify, suspend or cancel an activity which results in or threatens to result in adverse impacts upon the Antarctic environment should be specifically enacted in the legislation and not left to the exercise of official discretion.

7.      The jurisdictional scope of the legislation should specifically include the entire area south of 60 degreesSouth latitude, including the deep seabed, iceshelves and airspace.

8.      The governmental authorities responsible should be specifically required to respond to any violations reported by official inspection teams.

9.      Should those governmental authorities not take action against alleged violations or activities which threaten the Antarctic environment, citizens should have the right either to initiate proceedings against those authorities or to seek judicial review of their actions.

B.     MINERALS EXPLOITATION

10.     The ban on mining activities should be permanent; though the Protocol does provide for the revision of the mining ban after fifty years, the process for invoking this is by no means automatic. Domestic legislation therefore should not limit the minerals ban to any particular period of time.

11.     Member states should not assume that any existing laws which currently ban mineral exploitation will fulfil the ban on mining as stated in the Protocol.

12.     The deep seabed, as defined in the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention, should be specifically included within the terms of the mining ban.

13.     The legislation should specifically define the term "mineral resource"; such a definition should include ice within its scope and should also define "commercial" activity as distinct from "scientific" activity.

14.     An independent committee of experts should be identified or established and charged with the responsibility of deciding whether geological projects for which permit application has been made are in fact "bona fide" scientific research.

C.     UNIVERSALITY OF APPLICATION

15.     Legislation should apply equally to governmental operations, to governmental operations conducted jointly or in cooperation with one or more foreign governments, and to non-governmental operations.

16.     Legislation should also be binding on all citizens and residents of the country concerned whenever they are conducting activities in Antarctica, on all companies and on any expeditions departing from that country for Antarctica.

D.     AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

17.     Decisions on impact assessments and the granting of permits should be transparent, and leave open the possibility for review by additional agencies and the public.

18.     Operational agencies should not have responsibility for granting permits as this would require those agencies to regulate themselves.

E.  THE GRANTING OF PERMITS

19.  The legislation should clearly state that the basis for granting a permit should be 
the successful completion of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) which takes into 
account the principles outlined in Article 3 of the Protocol and guidelines or criteria that 
may be developed thereunder.

20.  The agency which grants the permits should under no circumstances be 
responsible for ensuring the proper implementation of permits.

F.  TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY

21.  As Antarctica is a remote place far from most enforcement techniques available 
domestically, the legislation should require and provide for a high degree of public 
scrutiny. Preliminary assessments for routine operations should be made publicly available 
once a permitting decision has been made.

22.  All permits granted under enabling legislation should be placed on public record.

23.  All environmental assessments should also be open to public scrutiny:

a)  Preliminary assessments for routine operations should be made public once a 
decision to grant a permit has been made;

b)  Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs) should be publicly available for comment 
prior to any decisions on permit applications and should not preclude the possibility of 
requiring a further Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE);

c)  Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations should be the subject of thorough 
and structured consultation with interested public groups, prior to the taking of any 
decision on permits;

d)  The legislation should guide the decision as to which country will co-ordinate the 
environmental impact process for a joint activity by stating specifically how that decision-
making process shall operate. This is a necessary inclusion to ensure that the assessment 
process is not short-circuited. The legislation should also specify that the process of 
Judicial Review also applies to the operation of that decision-making.

24.  It should be mandatory that before issuing a permit, the officials concerned take 
into account the views expressed during public consultation.

OVER AND BEYOND THE PROTOCOL

G.    AREA OF APPLICATION

25.     Parties should unilaterally extend the geographical scope of the area of 
        application of the legislation to the CCAMLR boundary which is the ecological boundary of 
        the Southern Ocean.

H.    CONSERVATION OF FLORA AND FAUNA

26.     In the Protocol as it currently stands, flora and fauna can be "taken", to provide for 
        unavoidable consequences of scientific activities, or for the construction and operation of 
        scientific support facilities.

27.     The language of the Protocol is very ambiguous in this respect, exemplified in the 
        frequent use of phrases such as "to the maximum extent practicable", which lend 
        themselves to liberal interpretation, inimical to maximum environmental protection.

28.     Permits which might authorise the harming or killing of animals or plants for 
        logistical reasons should only be issued as a last resort, when an Environmental Impact 
        Assessment (EIA) has concluded that there are no feasible alternatives.

29.     The above principle should be embodied in the legislation by inclusion of strict 
        conditions for the issue of such permits.

30.     Exceptions should be allowed only for emergencies involving loss of or severe 
        threat to human life or to the safety of ships or aircraft; they should not be allowed merely 
        when threats to equipment or facilities arise.

I     INFORMATION AND TRAINING

31.     The legislation should make it mandatory for national operators to provide to all 
        successful permit holders suitable training in and regularly updated information on 
        Antarctic environmental protection measures.

J.    IMMUNITY

32.     The sovereign immunity of ships from laws and regulations concerning control 

5

and prevention of marine pollution granted under Annex IV of the Protocol should be unilaterally waived.

33.     As military activity is prohibited under the Treaty, questions of sovereign immunity cannot arise in respect of such activities.

K.      WASTE DISPOSAL

34.     Both open burning and incineration of waste should be immediately prohibited and all waste removed from Antarctica for disposal in the country of origin.

35.     The Protocol does require that certain named products such as PCBs, non-sterile soil and polystyrene beads should not be disposed of in the Antarctic. Domestic legislation should prohibit even their transportation to Antarctica.

36.     Tertiary treatment should be the minimum standard for sewage, but complete removal is preferable.
