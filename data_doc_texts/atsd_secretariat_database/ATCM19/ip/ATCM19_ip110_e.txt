OPENING ADDRESS BY MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY-EXPERT DR.
EMMANUEL GOUNARIS,HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF GREECE

MR.CHAIRMAN

THE DELEGATION OF GREECE IS VERY PLEASED TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON
YOUR ELECTION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE XIX th CONSULTATIVE MEETING OF THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY.

AT THE SAME TIME MR.CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THE THANKS
OF MY DELEGATION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE
WARM HOSPITALITY EXTENDED TO US DURING THIS ANTARCTIC MEETING IN
YOUR HISTORICAL AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

MR CHAIRMAN,
THE QUESTION OF THE LOCATION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT
IT SEEMS TO MY DELEGATION TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.ALL OF US
WE NEED THIS SECRETARIAT AND ESPECIALLY THE NON CONSULTATIVE
STATES.

MY DELEGATION DEEPLY REGRETS ,THAT NO AN OFFICIAL CONSENSUS HAS
YET BEEN REACHED REGARDING THIS ISSUE,ALTHOUGH ALMOST ALL THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY STATES PARTIES,HAVE ALREADY DECIDED FOR BUENOS
AIRES AS CITY FOR THE LOCATION OF THE SECRETARIAT.

MR CHAIRMAN,
DURING THIS MEETING WE HAVE TO COME TO AN OFFICIAL CONSENSUS
REGARDING THIS MATTER;AN INTERMADIARY SOLUTION ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
IT SEEMS TO MY DELEGATION NOT AS A GOOD SOLUTION!WE NEED THE CON-
SENSUS NOW!

MR CHAIRMAN,
MATTERS RELEATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LIABILITY ANNEX AND TO
THE ELECTION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION NEED
A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION.WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SEE,THAT BOTH WORKING
GROUPS HAVE MADE A GREAT PROGRESS IN THEIR WORK DURING THIS
MEETING.

MR CHAIRMAN,
GREECE WOULD LIKE ALSO TO CONGRATULATE ITS NEIGHBOR COUNTRY
BULGARIA,FOR ITS SUCCESSFULLY PRESENCE IN THE ANTARCTICA.

FINALLY MR.CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM YOU,THAT THE PROCESS OF
THE RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE
ANTARCTIC TREATY,HAS ENTERED IN THE GREEK PARLIAMENT IN ITS FINAL
STAGE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR.CHAIRMAN
