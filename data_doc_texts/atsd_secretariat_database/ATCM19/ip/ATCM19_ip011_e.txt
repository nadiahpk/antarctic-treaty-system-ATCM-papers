CONSULTATIVE MEETING BY THE DEPOSITARY GOVERNMENT

ANTARCTIC SEALS (UNITED KINGDOM) IN ACCORDANCE

REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE XIXTH ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE 
MEETING BY THE DEPOSITARY GOVERNMENT OF THE CONVENTION FOR 
THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC SEALS (UNITED KINGDOM) IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH RECOMMENDATION XIII-2, PARAGRAPH 2(d)

1. This report covers events regarding the Convention for 
the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) from April 1994 
to the present. Events prior to April 1994 were reported 
to the XVIIth and XVIIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meetings (see Annexes B of the respective Final Reports).

2. Following the decision at the informal meeting of 
Contracting Parties in Tasmania in October 1993 that Parties 
should comply fully with the reporting requirement of 
Article 5 (Capture and Killing of Seals) of the Convention, 
the UK as depositary reminded Parties of this obligation by 
Diplomatic Note on 8 April 1994. It had been agreed that, in 
the case of 1994, Parties should submit reports by 1 May (for 
the period 1 March 1993 to 28 February 1994) in order that 
they would be available to the meeting of the SCAR Group of 
Specialists on Seals (25-27 May 1994). The results are 
reproduced as Annex A to this report. Reminders have been 
sent by Diplomatic Note to those Parties with outstanding 
responses.

3. As agreed at the above informal meeting the UK as 
depositary will remind Parties that returns for 1995 (for the 
period 1  March 1994 to 30 June 1995) should be transmitted 
to the UK and SCAR by 31 October 1995.

4. Since the XVIIIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
there have been no accessions to the Convention for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Seals. A list of countries which 
were original signatories of the Convention, and of countries 
which have subsequently acceded,  is attached (Annex B to this 
Report).
