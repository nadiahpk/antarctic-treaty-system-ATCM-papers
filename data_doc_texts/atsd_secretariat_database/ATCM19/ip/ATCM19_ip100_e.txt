FINLAND'S ANTARCTIC OPERATIONS

Nordic coopeation and the season 1995-96

Nordic coopeation in logistics was started in the end of last decade. Next time, in coming season it is Finland's turn to transport Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish expeditions to Antarctica.

The expedition will be focused on marine research. According to long term plans Finland will use the research vessel, R/V Aranda owned, by the Finnish Institute of Marine Research. The vessel was previous time in Antarctica in season 1989-90. Aranda is fairly small vessell, length 59 meters, weight 1600 GRT, accommodation is for 28 scientists. The capasity for cargo transportation is minor.

Research program will be composed of three main branches: 1) Chemical sampling and hydrographic profiling during the cruise to the Weddell Sea and in the eastern Weddell Sea, 2) Sea ice and remote sensing and air-sea interaction in the marginal ice zone in the eastern Weddell Sea, and 3) Marine geological studies in the continental shelf region off the Riiser-Larsen Ice Shelf. Additionally, a quick service and maintenance will be given to the automatic meteorological station at the Finnish station Aboa in Queen Maud Land. There will be no occupation in Aboa in the season 1995-96; meteorological station has worked continuously sending data via Argos system.

Marine geological programme will be a joint research of the Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Air-sea interaction and marine meteorology research has been planned in cooperation with the international AnZone/SCOR group.

Other international cooperation

Research joint work will be continued between Argentina and Finland concerning ozone sounding at Argentinian research station Marambio.

Evaluation of Finnish Antarctic Activities

Evaluation of Finnish Antarctic Activities was carried out in Finland. The report was published in March this year. The evaluation was done by the experts from Denmark, Norway and Sweden concerning natural sciences and human research, and Finnish evaluators concerning political, technical and commercial values. In general research was considered to be high level in most fields. More results should be published. There should be more transparency in the process of selecting the projects to be carried out. The organisation should be arranged on a permanent base and it should be connected to the arctic organisation and its development.
