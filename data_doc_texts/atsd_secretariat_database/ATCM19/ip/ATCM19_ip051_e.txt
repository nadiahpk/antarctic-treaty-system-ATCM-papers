1. Background

Antarctic marine environment has been least affected by human 
activities, and its ecosystem is characterized by relatively high 
diversity and biomass comparable to highly productive areas in the 
world. However, significant chemical contamination of marine 
environments and observable impacts to the benthic communities have 
been documented around some human settlements in the Antarctic 
(Lenihan et al., 1990).

Bivalve mollusks are known to concentrate heavy metals in their 
tissue and have been used extensively for monitoring pollution in 
coastal marine waters around the world under the design of the 
Mussel Watch program. In the Antarctic, at least two species, that is 
Adamussium colbecki and Laternula elliptica appear to meet the 
criteria for 'Mussel Watch' program (Farrington et al., 1983).

The Antarctic lamellibranch Laternula elliptica (king and Broderip) is 
endemic to the Antarctic with circum-polar distribution in nearshore 
waters around the Antarctic Continent and islands. By virtue of its 
wide distribution and high biomass, L. elliptica is nowadays highly 
recommended as a representative species possibly indicating human 
impacts on the Antarctic nearshore environments (SCAR, 1992). Up to 
now there have been no published data on heavy metal levels of L. 
elliptica, whereas metal levels of A. colbecki have been reported from 
various areas of Antarctic coastal waters (Mauri et al., 1990; Berkman 
& Nigro, 1992).

2. Objectives

-   To determine baseline levels of heavy metals in Laternula 
    elliptica

-   To determine whether L. elliptica could be used as an indicator 
    species in monitoring heavy metal contamination in Antarctic 
    nearshore waters.

3. Study Area

Marian Cove, Collins Harbor and the vicinity in the Maxwell Bay 
have been investigated to search Laternula elliptica during the 
1991/1992 and the 1992/1993 austral summer months. In Marian 
Cove, the density of L. elliptica ranged from 36 to 88 individuals 
(ind.) m^(-2) with the mean of 65 ind. m^(-2) at about 15 m depth. Highest 
density of L. elliptica up to 136 ind.(9 kg) m^(-2) occurred in Collins 
Harbor (62°10'S, 58°47'W), and Collins Harbor was chosen as a 
representative habitat of L. elliptica (Ahn, 1994).

4. Methods

4.1 Sample Collection
In the early February of 1993, Laternula elliptica and habitat 
sediment were hand-collected by SCUBA divers from 20-30 m depth of 
Collins Harbor (Fig. 1). The sampled animals were frozen at -20°C 
                                                     1
and maintained at this state until heavy metal analysis was 
conducted. Frozen samples of L. elliptica were partially thawed at 
room temperature and the total fresh weights (with and without shell) 
of each sample were determined. Then each of the clams was 
dissected into gonad, gill, kidney, digestive gland, siphon epidermis 
and the remainder (siphon, foot, mantle etc). Parts of each dissected 
clam were then freeze-dried for 48 hours. After freeze-drying, samples 
were ground.

4.2 Analytical Procedure
About 0.5 g of each sample was placed in a 60 ml teflon jar and 
oxidized with 10 ml of quartz distilled nitric acid at room temperature 
for 2 hours. For complete digestion each sample was added with 10 
ml nitric acid and refluxed in a screw-capped teflon jar on a hot plate 
(ca. 120° C) for several hours. The sample was then dried to remove 
excess acid at 80° C and cooled down at room temperature, and the 
residue was dissolved in 1 N HNO3. After centrifuging, the 
supernatant was taken and diluted (1:5 to 1:100) for measurement. 
The concentrations As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were 
determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer 
(PQ II+, VG Element). The concentration of Fe was determined using 
a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Spectra AA-20, Varian), 
and that of Hg by cold vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.

5. Results and Discussion

Size of Laternula elliptica used for the metal analysis ranged from 77 
to 94 mm (mean = 86, SD = 8) in shell length and from 63 to 127 g 
in total wet weight (mean = 102, SD = 22). Metal contents were 
highly variable among different organs (Table 1). Kidney seems the 
target organ for Zn, Cd and Pb, whereas siphon epidermis for Mn, Cu 
and Ni. Mercury level did not vary significantly among different soft 
parts of the clam. Overall, the metal levels in L. elliptica are 
comparable to the values obtained from the representative suspension-
feeding bivalves in temperate waters (Table 2). It is surprising to find 
such high metal levels in a species endemic to the Antarctic, where 
metal contamination appears unlikely. In particular, copper (39 μg g-1 
dry weight, ppm) and Manganese (74 ppm) levels were considerably 
high compared with the values reported from the representative 
bivalve species in temperate waters, Mytilus spp. (Table 2).

The sources of elevated Cu and Mn seem to be natural rather than 
anthropogenic. Lee et al. (1990) reported that copper level in the 
surface waters of the Maxwell Bay was elevated in the nearshore 
waters compared to the offshore waters, and ascribed this in part to 
fresh water input during summer. These Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd levels 
were much elevated with respect to the values in the Southern 
Ocean (Orren & Monteiro, 1985). Copper levels were highly elevated 
also in the habitat sediment (63-83 ppm) compared to the worldwide 
mean values (28-30 ppm) reported by (Cantillo & O'Connor, 1992). 
The elevation of Cu in sediment has apparently originated from 
erosion of terrigenous volcanic rocks which contain high level of Cu. 
Surrounding land consisted mainly of volcanic rocks containing high 
levels of Cu (>100-186 ppm) and Mn (500-1400 ppm) (Jwa and Lee,

2
1992). Metal concentrations slightly varied throughout the vertical 
depth within the sediment cores, indicating the elevations of some 
metal species are natural and not caused by human impacts.

Thus, relatively high levels of heavy metals were measured in 
Laternula elliptica, a species endemic to the Antarctic, where metal 
contamination appears unlikely. Further studies are required on 
bioaccumulation processes in L. elliptica. In addition, metal levels of 
the same species should be investigated at different Antarctic 
nearshore waters in order to elucidate baseline ecological patterns 
that could be used in interpreting anthropogenic impacts.
