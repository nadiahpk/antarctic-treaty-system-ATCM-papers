Implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
(No. 6 a of the preliminary agenda)

Since the adoption of the Environmental Protocol in Madrid in 1991, the following measures
aimed at implementing the Protocol have been taken on behalf of the Federal Republic of Ger-
many by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research:

Initial Environmental Evaluations have been drawn up and disseminated in application of the
Protocol before its entering into force for the dismantling of Georg Forster Station in the
Schirmacher oasis (former GDR winter station), the dismantling and clearance of the old
Georg von Neumayer Station, the reconstruction of Neumeyer Station on the Ekström shelf
ice, the construction of the ERS/VLBI station near O'Higgins, Antarctic Peninsula (in collabo-
ration with Chile) and the construction of Dallmann Laboratory near Jubany, King George
Island (in collaboration with Argentina).

Environmental Impact Assessments (Annex I) are carried out for all German activities in the
Antarctic. Special formats have been drawn up for that purpose. Waste Management Planning (Annex III) has been devised for the stations and the research
ship. Waste log books have been introduced and are kept up-to-date. The total volume of
waste is recorded annually. Waste minimization is regularly checked. Waste Management
Officials have been appointed. No grey water is discharged into Antarctic waters.

Germany operates a winter station, Neumayer Station. A contingency plan for oil accidents has
been developed. The plan has been circulated internationally.

As a matter of routine, all expedition members are informed orally and in writing before and
during the Antarctic expedition of the conditions and requirements of the Environmental Pro-
tocol and they must undertake to respect them.

Two stations have now been relinquished: the former winter station "Georg von Neumayer" and the winter station "Georg Forster" (formerly GDR). Georg von Neumayer Station was completely cleared in 1992/93. All facilities were removed from the treaty area. Only the protective steel pipes were left in the ice. As the station was lying 8 m under the surface of the snow by that time, removal of the pipes would have required enormous expenditure and major explosions which, in our view, would have caused excessive damage to the environment (cf. IEE).

Georg Forster Station is situated in the ice-free territory of the Schirmacher oasis in the vicinity of the Russian station "Novolazarevskaya". Within the framework of a German-Russian co-operation project, all station buildings and facilities will be demolished and removed from the treaty area. During this work all waste will be disposed of.
