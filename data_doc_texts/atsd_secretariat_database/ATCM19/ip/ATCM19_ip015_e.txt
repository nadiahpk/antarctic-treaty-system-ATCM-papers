Agenda Item 11
A REVIEW OF
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (EIAs)
PREPARED FOR PROPOSED ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTICA

1.      INTRODUCTION

The UK produced a review of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) prepared for proposed activities in Antarctica for the XVIII ATCM (XVIII ATCM Information Paper No. 9). This paper updates the review, and examines Initial Environmental Evaluations (IEEs) and Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations (CEEs) which have been published, circulated or made available up to the end of April 1995.

2.      METHODS

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has established a library of EIAs, both of IEEs and CEEs, produced since 1988 for proposed activities in Antarctica. For each EIA a summary was produced and each summary was then analyzed for the review. The details recorded for each EIA were:

-       Date of EIA (year)
-       Type of EIA (IEE, draft CEE, final CEE)
-       Category of activity
-       Location of activity (Latitude, Longitude)
-       Title of EIA
-       Author(s), if known
-       Organisation responsible
-       ATCP responsible.

3.      RESULTS

The study shows that since the adoption of the Environmental Protocol in 1991, the number of EIAs released per annum has steadily increased from 8 in 1991 to a maximum of 14 in 1993 (Figure 1). The totals for 1994 and 1995 appear low, and are thought to be incomplete.

A total of 49 EIAs have so far been released. Of these, 40 were IEEs (Table 1), 4 were draft CEEs and 5 were final CEEs (Table 2).

A detailed breakdown of the main categories of the proposed activities evaluated by the EIAs is given in Table 3. Considering all EIAs together, the most common category of activity assessed was the construction of a station facility. A total of 19 EIAs (all IEEs) were recorded in this category; approximately 40% of all EIAs analysed. This was followed by EIAs prepared for the construction, operation or rebuild of a research station (7 EIAs - 4 IEEs, 2 draft CEEs, 1 final CEE).

Most EIAs were carried out for activities proposed in coastal ice-free areas (Table 4).
A total of 26 EIAs (24 IEEs, 1 draft CEE, 1 final CEE) were placed in this category; 
approximately 60% of all EIAs analysed. Most EIAs in the top category were for 
proposed activities at research stations, with the highest numbers carried out at 
McMurdo Station (US) (6 IEEs) and Davis Station (Australia) (6 IEEs).

National Antarctic operators have written the vast majority of EIAs (Table 5). A total 
of 35 EIAs were in this category (30 IEEs, 1 draft CEE, 4 final CEEs); 
approximately 70% of all EIAs examined. Only 5 EIAs (all IEEs) have been prepared 
by non-governmental organisations. Of these, 2 were prepared by Greenpeace 
International, 2 for or by tour operators and one by a private company. The 
production of EIAs by tour operators is a welcome new development, as some now 
organise significant logistical programmes, involving both dedicated ships and 
aircraft.

Of the existing 26 Consultative Parties, 13 have been either wholly or partly 
responsible for at least one EIA (Table 6). One EIA (an IEE) was the responsibility 
of an acceding state. To date, Australia has produced the highest number of EIAs (13 
IEEs), followed by the USA (11 IEEs). A total of 5 EIAs (3 IEEs, 2 final CEEs) 
have been prepared jointly by two Consultative Parties.

4.    DISCUSSION

It is difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of how EIA is operating in 
Antarctica as information on EIAs, particularly IEEs, is not widely available. This 
is because many IEEs are produced only as unpublished reports with a limited 
national circulation. To try and overcome this problem, the UK has tabled a Working 
Paper and draft Resolution to the XIX ATCM on the circulation of information 
concerning EIAs. The UK proposes that each Contracting Party should submit to the 
host government of the next ATCM, a list of the IEEs and CEEs prepared, and 
decisions taken on them during the preceding calendar year. If such a proposal were 
approved, the collated list of IEEs and CEEs could then be published as an Annex to 
the Final Report of the ATCM.
