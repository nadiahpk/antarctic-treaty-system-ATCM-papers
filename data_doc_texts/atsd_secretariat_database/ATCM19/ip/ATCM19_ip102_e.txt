THE XIXth ANTARCTIC TREATY
CONSULTATIVE MEETING IN SEOUL

MAY 8 - 19, 1995

OPENING ADDRESS

AMBASSADOR JAN ARVESEN

HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF NORWAY
The Norwegian Delegation is pleased to inform the XIXth Consultative Meeting that Norway recently enacted implementation legislation to follow up the Norwegian Government's earlier ratification of the Madrid Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. This implementation legislation is in strict conformity with the provisions of the Protocol and its five annexes and stipulates, in some instances, obligations that go beyond what is required by the Protocol and its Annexes. The Norwegian implementation legislation entered into force on the 5th of May of this year according to decision taken by the King in Council. This means that Norwegian citizens, Norwegian juridical persons, Norwegian flag vessels and aircraft and foreigners domiciled in Norway are now under legal obligation to observe and abide by the rules and regulations of the Madrid Protocol.

Subsequent to the entering into force of the national implementation legislation Norwegian authorities are in a position to approve ATCM Recommendation XVIII -1 on tourism, and the other Consultative Parties will be formally notified accordingly in the near future.

As of today only 16 of the 26 Consultative Parties have ratified the Madrid Protocol. The Norwegian Delegation would urge the remaining Consultative Parties to conclude their ratification procedures without undue delay.

When the Protocol enters into force it will be imperative that the ATCM Secretariat has been established and is in operation. We must recognise that the decision on establishing a permanent secretariat is by now overdue. Some delegations, including our own, have during the intersessional period between the Kyoto ATCM and the present one made considerable efforts with a view to resolving the outstanding issue of the location of the Secretariat. Unfortunately, the impasse regarding this matter prevails. If we once again should fail to reach a consensus on the Secretariat question on a permanent basis, the Consultative Parties should at least here in Seoul do their utmost in order to agree on an interim solution.

The need for some kind of interim arrangement to provide Secretariat services to the Parties is for instance essential to ensure that the Transitional Environmental Working Group (TEWG) is functioning properly.
TEWG has started its work at this ATCM with active support from my delegation. We believe it is important that TEWG from the very outset be structured to the extent possible in a way that enables it to give such advise on scientific, environmental and technical issues as is envisaged for the Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP) in Article 12 of the Protocol.

Another important challenge with which we are faced at this meeting is how to improve the effectiveness of the Antarctic Treaty Regime and the decision making of the ATCM. As the work of the Antarctic Treaty Co-operation has become increasingly more complex over the years and will be even more so when the Madrid Protocol enters into force, we must take appropriate decisions here in Seoul on the basis of several working papers that have been submitted to this ATCM. My delegation is in particular referring to the working papers on pre-sessional documentation, on the organisation of ATCM and last, but not least, the working paper on measures under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty.
