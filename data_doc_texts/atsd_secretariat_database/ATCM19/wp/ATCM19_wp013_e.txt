ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ANTARCTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT

ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS

Agenda Item 8 a

(Submitted by Australia/Italy/South Africa)
establishment of financial and staff regulations

This paper reviews work undertaken so far and offers proposals addressing outstanding issues in order to assist consideration of the establishment of a secretariat during the Nineteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Functions

ATCM XVIII identified ten functions of a secretariat. These functions may briefly be described as follows:

1.      Assist in organisation and reporting of ATCM and other meetings
2.      Provide administrative assistance to the Committee on Environmental Protection (and the TEWG)
3.      Facilitate and coordinate communication and exchange of information among Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties
4.      Assist ATCM in reviewing information exchange requirements
5.      Establish data-bases relevant to the operation of the Antarctic Treaty and the Madrid Protocol
6.      Circulate information concerning activities of non-Parties in Antarctica
7.      Ensure coordination with other elements of the Antarctic Treaty System and other international bodies
8.      Maintain records of the ATCMs and other meetings and make available information about the Antarctic Treaty System
9.      Provide reports on its own activities to ATCM
10.   Perform such other functions as may be determined by ATCM.

It may perhaps be useful for ATCM to identify those functions which are considered to require priority attention, in order to assist the secretariat in its initial work. We would suggest that items 1, 2 and 3 are the most crucial functions with which a secretariat should concern itself in initially. Item 7 could, perhaps, also be added to the list of priority items. Coordination of ATCM and production of the annual ATCM report are likely to be the most demanding tasks facing a new secretariat, and represent a key area where a secretariat would add value to the Antarctic Treaty System. In addition, assistance to the TEWG will be essential in facilitating the effective implementation of the Madrid Protocol. Exchange of information is another key area which would be handled by a secretariat.
