Meteorological Services in Antarctica for Marine Navigation and Aviation

(Item 16)

(submitted by WMO)
Provision of Services in Antarctica particularly for Marine
Navigation and Aviation

1    Background

As part of the 2nd long term plan WMO has sought to improve
the availability of meteorological services in the
Antarctic.  The specific question of services for marine
navigation was raised in the XIV Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 1987 and was
referred to XX SCAR (Hobart 1988).  SCAR set up a joint
SCAR/WMO/IOC Expert Meeting to discuss the question and
this was held in Leningrad in early 1989 with its report
provided to XV ATCM in Paris in October 1989.  At this
meeting it was decided to refer the report for further
consideration by the WMO Working Group on Antarctic
Meteorology (EC-WGAM) which was requested to provide
information to the Council of Managers of National
Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) and subsequently to XVI ATCM.
As EC-WGAM meets only every four years consideration of the
item could not be made before December 1990.  EC-WGAM in
the report of its 5th Session held in Geneva at that time
outlined its position on the question which was, with minor
but significant modifications adopted by WMO Eleventh
Congress (Cg XI) and WMO Executive Council (EC-XLIII) in
May 1991.  The report was provided to COMNAP prior to its
meeting in June 1991.

2    WMO Consideration of Antarctic Services

The report of EC-WGAM (fifth session) on the item is shown
at Attachment 1 and the views expressed are essentially
similar to those of the Leningrad Group.  In producing the
report the WG also considered the related matter of
aviation services.  The reports of Cg XI and EC-XLIII
essentially confirmed these views but do not specify the
number of. forecast centres required using the term
"several".  In essence the current WMO position with regard
to Antarctic Meteorological services is summarised in the
following extract from the report of Cg XI.

"When discussing the Antarctic activities relating to the
implementation of the WWW in the Antarctic, in particular
the conclusions of the EC Working Group relating to the
development of meteorological services in support of
shipping and air navigation, Congress confirmed the need
for high-quality comprehensive meteorological services for
safety and efficiency of operational and research
activities in the Antarctic.  It also confirmed the
importance of the exchange of meteorological data between
stations in Antarctica.  Congress noted that substantial
services are provided by existing stations in Antarctica
but there is room for improvement relating to geographical
coverage (especially over west Antarctica) and appropriate
dissemination arrangements.  Congress agreed that several 
meteorological forecast centres would be required to cover 
the continent and neighbouring sea areas to meet the 
existing requirements for detailed services for limited 
areas and for forecasts of particular local meteorological 
conditions.

These meteorological forecast centres must have:  (a) 
access to relevant Antarctic data and to products 
transmitted on the GTS; (b) adequate facilities for 
communication: (c) the ability to receive high resolution 
data transmitted from satellites.  Support from existing 
RSMCs/WMCs should be arranged through the use of the WWW 
system for each of the meteorological forecast centres 
providing meteorological services.

Noting the difficulties of maintaining staff and equipment 
in Antarctica.  Congress agreed that the establishment of a 
GDPS Global Data Processing System centre on this continent 
is not required at present.  Congress requested the 
Executive Council, through its Working Group on Antarctic 
Meteorology, to arrange for adequate support for operations 
in Antarctica in consultation with the president of the 
Commission for Basic Systems."

4.2     Data-processing system (Agenda item 4.2)

4.2.1   The session reviewed requirements for Antarctic meteorological data 
from Antarctic stations as well as requirements for GDPS products from 
Antarctic stations.  These requirements were amended by the working group and 
included as Annexes II and III to the final report as guidance material for 
the implementation of the Meteorological Services activities in the Antarctic.

4.2.2   As regards Meteorological Services to support activities in the 
Antarctic the working group considered requirements for meteorological 
services in support of shipping and air navigation as well as other operations 
and research in Antarctica and the Southern ocean.  It identified requirements 
for some products from advanced GDPS centres outside Antarctica e.g. analysis 
and forecasts of geopotential height, wind and temperature at standard levels 
and also for other products for which more local input was required, in 
particular those prepared using locally received satellite imagery. (Examples 
are surface frontal analysis and analysis of sea-ice). A comprehensive list of 
requirements is contained in Annex IV.

4.2.3   In view of the diverse nature of these requirements the working group 
developed the following structure for the provision of services:

(a)     Global and regional model products to be prepared by advanced GDPS 
centres outside Antarctica.  State-of-the art NWP and four-dimentional 
data assimilation systems are needed to utilize most effectively the 
relatively sparse data available in the area, in particular to 
assimilate satellite soundings and other asynoptic data such as those 
from drifting buoys and automatic weather stations;

(b)     Interpretation within Antarctica of NWP products and provision of 
sea-ice analyses and prognoses using locally available information 
from polar orbiting satellites;

(c)     Provision of forecasts to users by forecasters attached to ships, 
stations or field parties.

The working group noted that (a) and (c) were already taken care of 
but that (b) was only presently available to a limited extent.

4.2.4   Taking stock of the present situation the working group noted that 
there are several Antarctic stations (McMurdo, Molodezaja, Casey, Marambio, 
Frei), providing international services upon request and that the data 
exchange requirements are largely covered by point-to-point transmissions and 
a few broadcast services.  It was also informed of the efforts made by 
Australia to upgrade its facilities at Casey by installing AVHRR-equipment, a 
meteorological workstation and appropriate links with WMC Melbourne which 
would offer regular services covering an area between 45°E and 170°E of the 
Antarctic continent and neighbouring sea areas.  Casey would be ready to 
provide (on the basis of the global model and a special regional model for 
Antarctica produced by WMC Melbourne) 48 hour forecasts and a number of other 
specialized forecast and analysis products twice daily and warnings etc. to 
meet the requirements of users in this sector of Antarctica.  These products 
will be disseminated initially via HF broadcast.  The working group was 
further informed that Argentina had already replaced at Marambio the
facilities which suffered from a fire in 1989, except the APT equipment which 
will be replaced in 1991. Therefore the Centre at Marambio has continued to 
provide the same level of meteorological services as before.  In the absence 
of specific information from the USSR, it was noted that station Molodeznaja 
operated by the USSR is at present providing fairly extensive meteorological 
support to operators in and around Antarctica and substantial equipment and 
manpower is maintained at the station for this purpose. Similarly, McMurdo 
offers meteorological services upon request to international users.  These 
services are based upon support from WMC Washington and on substantial 
capabilities at the station. No specific information was available to the 
working group on the current programme at Frei.

4.2.5  Analyzing the present state of meteorological support in Antarctica 
and also considering the developing requirements in regard to marine and 
aviation operations, the working group came to the following conclusions:

    (a)     The need for high-quality, comprehensive meteorological services for 
            safety and efficiency of Antarctic activities is confirmed;

    (b)     Substantial services are provided by existing stations in Antarctica 
            but there is room for improvement relating to geographical coverage 
            (specially over West Antarctica) and appropriate dissemination 
            arrangements;

    (c)     There is a requirement for detailed services for limited areas and 
            particular local meteorological conditions which would require several 
            (minimum 4) forecast centres in Antarctica to cover the continent and 
            neighbouring sea areas (i.e. services described in 
            paragraph 4.2.3 (b));

    (d)     From the viewpoint of maintaining staff and equipment in Antarctica 
            the establishment of an RSMC on this continent is neither justified 
            nor at present required;

    (e)     Support from existing RSMCs/WMCs can be arranged through use of the 
            WWW system for each of the meteorological forecast centres providing 
            international services;

    (f)     Present requirements call for tailored forecasts provided upon request 
            but it is likely that they will be replaced by requirements for 
            regular scheduled services and broad-based dissemination arrangements 
            offering information packages for various types of applications.

4.2.6  Looking at the list of requirements the working group noted that it 
contained mainly items which are already covered. It agreed, therefore, that 
the list should be expanded to include also future requirements, although the 
scientific and technical means to meet them do not yet exist.

4.2.7  The session also concluded that to produce and disseminate products 
listed in the annex a, forecast centre must have:

    (a)     access to relevant Antarctic data, and in addition access to products 
            transmitted on the GTS;

    (b)     adequate facilities for communication by satfax (INTELSAT or 
            INMARSAT), wefax, HF teleprinter, HF voice and VHF to transmit hard 
            copy, coded or plain language messages;

    (c)     the ability to receive high resolution data (AVHRR, HRPT, SAR, etc.) 
            transmitted from polar orbiting satellites.

4.2.8  The working group further agreed that the chapter of the Manual on the 
GDPS on Data-processing Activities and Meteorological Services in the 
Antarctic needed to be revised at a future stage in the light of the above 
conclusions.
