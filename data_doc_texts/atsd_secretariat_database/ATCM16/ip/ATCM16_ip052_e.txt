OPENING STATEMENT BY THE HEAD OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
DELEGATION TO THE XVITH ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE 
MEETING

Mr. Chairman,

It gives me pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your 
election as Chairman of this meeting, and I should like to 
assure you of the fullest support of the South African 
delegation.

Allow me also, through the Chair, to thank the Government of 
Germany on behalf of my Government, for hosting this XVIth 
Consultative meeting in Bonn. This meeting is an historic 
occasion as we commemorate the signing of the Antarctic 
Treaty thirty years ago, and as is recommended in ATCM 
recommendation XV-22, a commemorative stamp will be issued 
in South Africa on 5 December 1991, to mark the anniversary.

South Africa is in the process of designing a new Antarctic 
Station, and it is the intention that it will be erected at 
Veleskarvet (71°40'S 02°51'W) in Queen Maud Land during the 
1992/93 summer season. By moving the base inland, closer 
logistical cooperation between fellow Treaty countries 
operating in the area will be possible. From a scientific 
point of view the new base will make provision for 
collaborative scientific programmes, and we look forward to 
a period of new cooperation and joint ventures on both the 
scientific and logistic fronts.

In the meantime, an environmental impact assessment will be 
carried out during the 1991/92 summer season, after which 
the results will be made known to member countries and their 
comments invited.

As is known to ATCM-countries with a vested interest in the 
same area as South Africa, Cape Town is ideally located for 
rendering  logistic  support  to  ships,  aircraft  and 
expeditions to the Antarctic.  The SA Government will gladly 
assist  in accommodating interested parties wishing to use 
Cape Town as a support base for their expeditions.

May  I take  this opportunity of assuring Antarctic Treaty 
parties  of  South  Africa's  commitment  to  environmental 
conservation in Antarctica.  We shall do everything possible 
to  ensure  that  the  fragile  systems  are not  damaged  or 
destroyed.

In conclusion, may I state that the success and achievements 
of the past should, however, not lead to complacency on the 
part  of  the  Consultative Parties.   It should be accepted 
that the coming years will be more challenging than the past 
30  years.   We  believe  that  the  splendid  spirit  of 
cooperation and compromise which has lead to successful 
solutions  to  common  problems  in  the  past,  including  the 
signing of the Madrid Protocol a few days ago, will continue 
to flourish in the future.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
