MARINE HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL SERVICES TO NAVIGATION
IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN

(submitted by the USSR Delegation)
1. Background

The XVth Consultative Meeting adopted Recommendation XV-18 on co-operation in 
the sphere of meteorological and marine information services to maritime and air navigation 
in Antarctica.

In accordance with Recommendation XV-18, the matter was referred for official 
consideration in the WMO Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology and reported on at the 
11th Congress of WMO.

WMO confirmed the undoubted importance of improving meteorological services for 
ensuring the safety and effectiveness of scientific operations and research in Antarctica.

After WMO had considered this matter, it was referred for discussion at a COMNAP 
meeting. The results of this discussion are contained in the COMNAP report submitted to the 
XVIth ATCM.

2. USSR view of future activities

The Soviet Delegation considers it extremely useful to continue activities aimed at 
improving marine meteorological and ice information services in Antartica.

Without prejudging the outcome of the discussion on the status of implementation of 
Recommendation XV-18, we wish to draw attention to the undoubtedly true premise, arising 
out of WMO's consideration of the matter, that before regional forecasting centres are set up 
in Antarctica, the existing meteorological and ice observation network in the southern polar 
region needs to be radically improved and developed.

We also have to agree into the view expressed in COMNAP that the most effective way 
of improving the observation network at the present time is by extension of the system of 
automatic weather station installations on the continent and drifting buoys in the seas 
surrounding Antarctica.

Clearly SCAR's attention should be drawn to the need to take account of WMO's 
recommendations in drawing up proposals for improving meteorological forecasting support 
for national expeditions in the planning of large-scale scientific projects, particularly those of 
an international nature and projects being implemented in Antarctic waters.

In view of the possible outcome of the forthcoming exchange of opinions on the status
of implementation of Recommendation XV-18, COMNAP's attention could be drawn to the
desirability of holding consultations - as one of the forms of future work - on co-ordination of
national plans for developing meteorological and ice observations in the existing
expeditionary network.
