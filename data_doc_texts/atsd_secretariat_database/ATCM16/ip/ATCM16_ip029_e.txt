Site Description and Map for SSSI 17, Clark Peninsula, Casey

(Item 11 (c))

(submitted by Australia)
SITE DESCRIPTION AND MAP FOR SSSI 17, CLARK PENINSULA, CASEY

Australia advises delegations of corrections to the site description and map included in the Management Plan for SSSI 17, Clark Peninsula, Casey, which are necessary following the discovery of errors in the original site description and map, as follows:

•	there is a typographical error - G3 should read G8, and trigonometrical station NM/5/6 should read G7;

•	the cove currently marked as Stevenson Cove is in fact Powell Cove - Stevenson Cove is east of Blakeney Point; and

•	incorrect description of the site's eastern boundary.

The site description should therefore read as follows (the incorrect wording is struck through and enclosed in square brackets and the correct wording is underlined):

(i)	Description of Site

Clark Peninsula is situated on the north side of Newcomb Bay at the west end of Vincennes Bay, opposite Windmill Islands, on Budd Coast, at lat 66°15'S, long 110°36'E. The Site comprises all land on Clark Peninsula within the southern boundary line connecting the east side of [Stevenson Cove] Powell Cove to trigonometrical station [NM/5/6] G7, trig station [G3] G8 and a point to the east-south-east on Løken Moraines. The western eastern boundary is the easternmost westernmost limit of Løken Moraines as far north as a point due east of Blakeney Point, and thence to the coast. The boundary of the Site will be indicated by prominent markers, and is shown on the attached map.

A copy of the revised map is at Attachment A.

The changes do not have any affect on the management plan as such, they are merely to rectify errors in the original site description and map.
