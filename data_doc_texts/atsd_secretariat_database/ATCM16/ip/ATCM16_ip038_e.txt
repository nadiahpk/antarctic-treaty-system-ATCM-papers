TRENDS IN ANTARCTIC TOURISM

Information Paper Submitted by the UK Delegation

TOURIST NUMBERS

1.  Antarctica emerged as an established tourist destination only 35 years ago. The number of tourists who have visited Antarctica since then is difficult to establish with absolute certainty due to the lack of uniformity in reporting procedures. However, data are available for 28 of these years and the record compiled from the 1965/66 season to the present indicates that Antarctic tourism is experiencing a period of substantial growth. For example, of the approximate 39,000 tourists who have visited Antarctica since 1957, more than 40% have travelled during the past five summer seasons (1986/87 through to 1990/91).

2.  Tourist numbers visiting Antarctica increased by more than 600% between the 1985/86 (782 tourists) and 1990/91 (4,842 tourists) seasons (Table 1). Commercial cruise liners currently bring the greatest number of tourists to Antarctica, and many have the Antarctic Peninsula area and its islands as their destination. Seaborne tourists since 1957/58 have totalled more than 37,000 (Table 2) and from 1980/81 onwards such tourists have comprised more than 93% of visitors. During the 1990/91 season this percentage increased to more than 97% (Fig 1). In 1989/90 there were 21 tour ship visits to Antarctica. This figure rose to 35 for the 1990/91 season and included 8 tour operators using 8 different vessels. Five ships known to have operated on the South Atlantic side of the Antarctic during last season include SOCIETY EXPLORER (Society Expeditions), ILLIRIA and POLAR CIRCLE (Travel Dynamics), OCEAN PRINCESS (Ocean Cruise Lines) and POMAIRE (Marinsular). Two ships which operated from the Australian/New Zealand side were FRONTIER SPIRIT (Salen Lindblad Cruising) and WORLD DISCOVERER (Society Expeditions).

3.  Far fewer tourists travel to Antarctica by air than by sea (Fig 2) and airborne services have increased the total number of Antarctic tourists only marginally.

SHIPBORNE TOURISM - HISTORICAL

4.      Cruise ship tours to Antarctica began in 1957/58 when 
Argentina and Chile ran 4 tourist cruises and more than 500 
tourists to the South Shetland Islands.  There then followed a 
lull until 1966 when Lindblad Travel of New York resumed cruise 
ship tourism.  Following the initial success with the chartered 
Argentine vessel LAPATAIA, Lindblad organised regular cruises 
to the Antarctic from the late 1960s onwards.  During the 1970s 
and 1980s, Antarctic tourism was offered by firms in the United 
States, Canada, West Germany, Italy, Spain, Chile, the United 
Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and from 1966 until the early 
1980s Lindblad Travel offered the largest number of Antarctic 
cruises, closely followed by Society Expeditions.  From 1982/83 
through to 1990/91, however, Society Expeditions offered 84 
Antarctic cruises, compared to Lindblad's 25.  As of 1990, 
'Society Expeditions' has operated more than 110 tourist cruises 
in Antarctica.  In contrast, Travel Dynamics has offered 23 
cruises since the 1988/89 season.

AIRBORNE TOURISM - HISTORICAL

5.      The first Antarctic tourist flight was made in December 1956 
by a Chilean national airline Douglas DC-6B with 66 passengers on 
board, whilst the first commercial flight to land in Antarctica 
(at McMurdo) was a Pan Am Stratocruiser in October 1957.  Over-
flights of Antarctica, popular in the 1970s, brought plane loads 
of tourists who never set foot on the continent.  From 
February 1977 to December 1980, Quantas and Air New Zealand 
offered 44 flights which carried a total of more than 11,000 
passengers.  These numbers have not been included in the attached 
Tables and Figures.

CURRENT SITUATION

6.      During the 1990/91 season more than 4,800 tourists visited 
Antarctica.  This represents the largest tourist presence 
recorded with tourists now outnumbering national science and 
logistic personnel (ca 4,000 staff).  The previous record of 
3,644 tourists occurred during the 1974/75 season when 6 of the 
7 cruises averaged 474 passengers each.

MR2AAR/3
7.    American-based tour operators carry the greatest number of 
tourists to Antarctica. Among these operators are:  Condor 
Expeditions International (New York), Forum Travel International 
(California), Mountain Travel (California), Ocean Cruise Lines 
(Florida), Salen Lindblad Cruising (Connecticut) which also acts 
as sales agent for Quark Expeditions, Society Expeditions 
(Washington), Travcoa (California) and Travel Dynamics (New York). 
Zegrahm Expeditions (Washington), is the latest entrant into the 
market, with planned cruises for the 1991/92 season.

8.    Some tour operators offer a combination cruise/flight visit 
to Antarctica. Under this plan, tourists have the option to fly 
one-way which reduces both cost and the amount of time needed for 
an Antarctic holiday, whilst avoiding a second crossing of the 
Drake Passage by ship.  These shorter visits prove more lucrative 
for tour operators whilst allowing a larger tourist market to be 
targetted.

9.    The behaviour patterns and number of tourists aboard 
Antarctic-bound vessels vary enormously.  Private yachts have 
been manned solo or may carry up to 20 fare-paying passengers. 
Cruise ships such as SOCIETY EXPLORER and WORLD DISCOVERER carry 
from 98 to 139 passengers.  The Spanish cruise aboard CABO SAN 
ROQUE in January 1973 carried about 900 tourists.  The Argentine 
cruises conducted from 1958 until 1976 when fuel costs deterred 
further tourist operations 'could generally accommodate 400-800 
passengers, and one cruise is believed to have carried 1,250 
persons'.  The OCEAN PRINCESS, operated by Ocean Cruise Lines, 
and first used in Antarctica during the 1990/91 season can carry 
480 passengers.  Precise numbers of visits made by small or 
non-commercial expeditions to Antarctica are more difficult to 
obtain than those of scheduled commercial cruises or flights 
which are normally reported to home governments by respective 
tour operators, and later exchanged under the information 
provision of para VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty.

ANTARCTICA TOUR OPERATORS
FORM ASSOCIATION

Earlier this year the Antarctic Treaty nations signed the Environmental Protocol
assuring the continued protection of endemic flora and fauna, banning mineral exploitation
for the future and strengthening safeguards for the durable protection of this unique
environment.

In an unprecedented move, tour operators who, for many years, have operated
environmentally sound expeditions to Antarctica, have founded the International
Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO).

The public will be increasingly knowledgeable about Antarctica and politicians will
be called upon to propose legislation. Recent statements in the press indicate that
politicians and other spokesmen are poorly informed and hold grave misconceptions in
regard to the way tourism is conducted in Antarctica.

IAATO's members are all experienced Antarctica tour operators, who have worked
closely together with scientists, environmental groups and the National Science Foundation
at educating and informing the visitors they bring to Antarctica.

IAATO's members strongly believe that environmentally conscious tourism to
Antarctica will benefit the continent's future preservation. IAATO's members have carried
the large majority of all visitors who have traveled to Antarctica over the last 25 years.
Each visitor they have taken to Antarctica returns a well informed Antarctic Ambassador.
Environmentally-sound and educational travel to Antarctica, therefore, will continue to be
an essential element in creating public support for protective legislation and in guarding
against future attempts to exploit the mineral wealth and the rich wildlife of this continent
and its surrounding seas.

IAATO's members strongly believe that the ultimate protection and conservation of
Antarctica will largely depend on sound policy to which all Treaty nations adhere.
IAATO's members have testified at hearings regarding such legislation and pursue active
participation in their governments' Antarctic Advisory Committees. Only well inf?med
politicians, activated by their well informed constituencies, will be able to pass proper 
safeguarding legislation.

IAATO's associate members will include prestigious non-profit organizations, 
alumni associations, museums and individual travelers, all of whom will be generating 
support for the preservation of Antarctica.

The manner in which IAATO members have conducted their expeditions to 
Antarctica has been praised as a model of self-regulation. Recognizing the need to protect 
Antarctica's fragil eco-systems, the members set guidelines several years ago for tour 
operators, and pledge:
- to be knowledgeable of and abide by the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978;
- to not enter areas designated as being of specific scientific interest or that need 
    special protection;
- to operate only with qualified expedition staff of which at least 75% must have 
    previous Antarctic experience;
- to hire only Zodiac drivers with experience in polar regions (essential to safe 
    operations);
- to educate passengers and crew and enforce the members' self imposed Antarctica 
    Visitor Guidelines;
- to assign one qualified naturalist staff member to accompany and supervise each 
    group of maximum 20-25 passengers ashore;
- to cooperate with science stations and to not disturb sites of science research;
- to limit the number of passengers ashore;
- to follow the international MARPOL treaty guidelines regarding marine pollution.

IAATO's members also set guidelines for visitors to abide by. A copy of these 
guidelines is attached. They reflect conservation practices and procedures to follow when 
passengers are ashore under the supervision of their naturalist staff. Regular briefings on 
these guidelines and the Antarctic Conservation Act are given to passengers on board.

IAATO will work at having these Tour Operator and Visitor Guidelines adopted and 
adhered to by all Treaty Nation members.

The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO)
has endorsed the following guidelines for aircraft and land-based
private-sector travel to and within the Antarctic interior:

Members and prospective members of IAATO agree that they will:

- Know and understand the relevant provisions of the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
Antarctic Treaty and Annexes, and shall wherever
practicable, fully comply with those provisions,
whether or not their own country has issued
legislation to require compliance. They will also
ensure that all staff and clients are properly briefed
on those provisions that might affect them.

- Operate flights and programs such that maximum
safety for all participants and with minimum impact
on the Antarctic environment is assured.

- Will establish a set of policies and emergency
procedures that will be applicable to all foreseeable
accidents and unplanned events that might occur
with the operations.

- Provide pilots, guides and support personnel who
have had adequate training and experience, in the
context of Antarctica, to cope with anticipated
conditions, potential problems and reasonably
foreseeable emergencies.

- Arrange back-up aircraft to be available for all air
and land-based activity.

- Verify that all participants are in adequate physical
condition to cope with the anticipated physiological,
topographic and climatic rigours that will be
encountered.

- Maintain regular radio contact between their
operational aircraft of field parties and their base of
field operations, and between field base and the
outside world. This will include maintaining a listing
radio watch while any of their aircraft are in the air.

- Provide all aircraft with appropriate survival
equipment and emergency supplies to support the
crew and all passengers for at least 7 days.

- Will establish and maintain at adequate levels,
caches of fuel to enable the emergency evacuation by
air of seriously injured or sick personnel to the
nearest medical facility.

- Will establish and maintain at adequate levels,
caches of camping equipment, food, cooking fuel
and medical supplies to enable all personnel, staff
and clients, to survive in the field for at least 30 days
without resupply from the outside.

- Maintain close working collaboration with the
appropriate aeronautical authorities, civil and
military for air traffic control, Search and Rescue,
meteorological reports etc. and contact with other air
operators.

- Maintain a policy of having all aircraft under their
control available at all times to respond, if required,
to an emergency in Antarctica.

- Operate aircraft such that populations of birds and
seals are not subjected to stress, such as landing or
taking off, low flying, air drops etc. within 1500
metres (1 mile) of breeding colonies.

- Take all reasonable precautions that fuel etc. stored
in caches does not leak or is spilled during re-
fuelling operations. Fuel caches located in areas of
snow accumulation and/or glacier movement, will
be marked with adequate beacons to enable recovery
at a later date.

- Remove from Antarctica for sanitary disposal back
in civilization, all refuse (including human waste)
generated at their operational bases. Wherever
feasible, consistent with associated environmental
impact limits, collect and remove refuse generated
by their field parties, including empty fuel drums
etc.
