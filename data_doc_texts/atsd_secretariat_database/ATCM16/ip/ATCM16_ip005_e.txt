Reports of Inspections under Article VII
of the Antarctic Treaty

(submitted by the United Kingdom)
REPORTS OF INSPECTIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY.
INFORMATION PAPER - SUBMITTED BY THE UK DELEGATION.

The use of Antarctica for peaceful purposes only is the guiding principle of the Antarctic Treaty and the implementation of the inspection provisions under Article VII of the Treaty has ensured that this principle has been upheld.

Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have discussed, on a number of previous occasions, the desirability of making Inspection Reports widely available. It has been pointed out that wide dissemination contributes to accurate and complete information about the Antarctic Treaty System and maintains the confidence of Parties to the Treaty, and others asserting an interest in Antarctica, that the objectives and provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and Recommendations adopted pursuant to it are being implemented and enforced.

At ATCM XIV it was noted further that Inspection Reports provided a basis for exchange of information and ideas on Antarctic operations. Inspections may, for example, identify and bring to the attention of Contracting Parties emerging problems requiring correction or improvement. Parties may in addition learn from the experience of others through such Inspection Reports.

However, in trying to bring together a set of reports on Inspections under the Antarctic Treaty it became apparent that not all reports of inspections carried out so far (see Annex A) are readily available. We would recommend that this situation be remedied and that as a matter of some urgency all existing reports should be brought together and published.

Thereafter, similar compilations should be carried out at suitable intervals.
