SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL ON ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION BETWEEN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC AND THE REPUBLIC OF 
CHILE.


The  Government  of  the  Argentine  Republic  and  the 
Government of the Republic of Chile, hereinafter referred to 
as "the Parties";


Bearing in mind the importance of Antarctic regions on 
which their continental masses are projected;  the influence 
of the Antarctic meteorological phenomena, of the Antarctic 
marine currents and of the Antarctic ecosystems, with which 
their  living  resources  are  associated  or  straddle  between 
both habitats;  and  the  need  to  protect  and  preserve 
Antarctica for future generations;


Recalling  the  Joint  Declarations  on  Antarctica  and, 
particularly,  the  Presidential  Declaration  of  August  29, 
1990, and taking into account the provisions of the Protocol 
on  Environmental  Protection  to  the  Antarctic  Treaty, 
negotiated at the XI Special Consultative Meeting of the 
Antarctic Treaty;


Taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  Treaty  on  the 
Environment  signed  by  both  Governments  on  August  2,  1991, 
particularly articles II and III, inasmuch as they provide 
the  mandate  to  coordinate  actions  in  specific  fields  through 
the adoption of additional protocols,


Have agreed as follows:


ARTICLE I
Protection of Antarctic values


The Parties shall promote the conservation of Antarctic 
natural  and  cultural  values,  through  appropriate  actions  to 
protect designated areas, preserve and restore historic sites 
and  monuments,  implement  the  related  rules  of  conduct  adopted 
in  the  context  of  the  Antarctic  Treaty  and  to  foster 
awareness on the intrinsic values of Antarctica.


ARTICLE II
Exchange of information


In  order  to  avoid  possible  adverse  impacts  on  the 
Antarctic  environment  and  dependent  and  associated 
ecosystems,  the  parties  shall  exchange  information  on  the 
planning and implementation of activities in Antarctica.


With  that  purpose,  they  shall  cooperate  in  the 
elaboration of technical or other guidelines that may be
deemed useful to facilitate the environmentally harmonious
planning of their activities in Antarctica.

ARTICLE III
Environmental Monitoring

The Parties shall give priority in their Antarctic
national programmes to the monitoring of those global
environmental changes that could affect the ozone layer over
Antarctica, the Antarctic terrestrial, marine and atmospheric
environments, or the dependent and associated ecosystems.

The Parties undertake to establish environmental
monitoring programmes to verify the predicted effects and
detect the possible unforeseen effects on the environment and
on the Antarctic living resources of activities carried out
in the Antarctic Treaty area, including:

a) waste disposal;
b) contamination by hydrocarbons or other hazardous or toxic
substances;

c) construction and operation of stations, shelters, field
camps, ships, aircrafts and other forms of logistic support;

d) scientific programmes;

e) recreational activities;

f) activities that could affect the purposes of designated
protected areas.

The Parties may establish joint or complementary
monitoring programmes aimed at detecting, quantifying and
determining the probable causes of observed changes on air,
snow and water quality and other key features of the
Antarctic environment and biodiversity.

ARTICLE IV
Cooperation

The Parties shall promote programmes of scientific, technical
and educational cooperation for the protection and
conservation of the Antarctic environment and of the
dependent and associated ecosystems which may encompass,
among other fields:

a) the training of scientific and technical personnel,

b) the Antarctic environmental management,

c) the preparation of environmental impact assessments,
d) the exchange of information on polar technologies,

e) the research of every kind of polluting substances which 
may be found in the Antarctic Treaty area,

f) the availability of facilities and laboratories for 
utilization by researchers of both countries.

ARTICLE V
         Consultation

In order to avoid indesirable effects on scientific 
research or accumulative impacts on the Antarctic environment 
coming from their excessive concentration in a specific area,
the Parties shall maintain consultations about the choices 
for emplacement of possible stations and other facilities.

The Parties will, when appropriate, consider the 
undertaking of joint expeditions, the logistic cooperation,
exchange of personnel and any other form of coordination or 
joint action that could contribute to avoid interferences 
with existing scientific programmes, adverse environmental 
impacts and prejudicial effects to other established uses.

ARTICLE VI
         Coordination

The Parties shall determine by mutual agreement the ways 
to prepare, publish and implement the environmental impact 
procedures appliable to jointly planned activities in the 
Antarctic Treaty area for which an advance notice is 
required, in accordance with Article VII (5) of the Antarctic 
Treaty.

The Parties shall also coordinate the adoption of 
uniform inspection procedures and the exchange of information 
on those inspections aimed at promoting the protection of the 
Antarctic environment and of the dependent and associated 
ecosystems.When appropriate, joint inspections may be 
undertaken.

ARTICLE VII
         Prevention and safety

The Parties shall coordinate the study, planning, 
implementation and execution of procedures appliable in cases 
of natural disasters and accidents requiring a prompt and 
effective response. For that purpose the Parties shall:

a) continuosly examine the effectiveness of measures aimed at 
preventing or reducing environmental pollution,
b) cooperate in the formulation and implementation of
contingency plans and emergency actions relating to accidents
and environmental risks, including joint activities which may
be deemed necessary.

c) exchange information on air and maritime safety measures,
including lighthousing, chartography, meteorological and sea
ice information, in accordance with the rules and procedures
established by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.

ARTICLE VIII
Waste and disposal

In order to ensure that no waste be introduced and no
disposal be made in the Antarctic Treaty area, the Parties
shall coordinate their actions to control the movements of
radioactive, toxic and hazardous waste originating outside
the said area.

The Parties shall encourage the implementation of new
and better methods of waste disposal in Antarctica as well as
of waste management technics with low environmental impact,
including those allowing for better energy and water
conservation.

ARTICLE IX
Legislative harmonization

The Parties shall promote the exchange of precedents and
experiences with a view to promote the harmonization of their
national legislations in matters concerning compliance,
emergency response, liability, dispute settlement and other
measures aimed at ensuring the full implementation of the
agreements on protection of the Antarctic environment and of
its dependent and associated ecosystems.

ARTICLE X
Annual meetings

The Parties shall hold annual meetings devoted to
analysis, coordination and planning; these meetings will
consider:

a) the level of compliance with this Protocol,

b) the convenience of establishing additional programmes,

c) the amendment or broadening of existing agreements,

d) any other additional measure that could be considered
beneficial for the protection of the Antarctic environment
and of its dependent and associated ecosystems.
ARTICLE XI
Obligations of the Parties
