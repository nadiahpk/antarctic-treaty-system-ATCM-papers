(submitted by the Delegation of Bulgaria)
BULGARIAN  ANTARCTIC  REFUGE
"Sofia University"

A Bulgarian refuge, named "Sofia University", was set up on 
Livigston Island, South Shetland Archipelago, in April 1988, on a 
spot at the North-East side of South Bay, with coordinates 
62°38, 6'S and 60°21, 7'W, about three km to the North-North-East 
of the Spanish Polar Base "Juan Carlos I".

It is located on a flat gravel area on the third marine 
terrace, 12 m above sea level and 180 m from the shore edge. Its 
surface declines gently (2-4° ) to the West. Miers Bluff Formation 
sedimentary rocks outcrop to the South-East of the refuge. The 
beds of season brooks, coming from the snowfield front, about 600 
m to the East of the refuge, lie along the northern and southern 
sides of the ground.

Except these two brooks, water may be obtained from a summer 
lake on the second marine terrace, below the refuge, or from a 
subglacial one, about 600 m to the North-East.

The sea shore is a gravel beach (first marine terrace), with 
a maximum width of 100 m, about 1,5 km long. Two single rocks 
stand in the sea, at 30 and 50 m from the shore, respectively.

The surrounding hills do not exceed 100 m in altitude. The 
highest mount, with an altitude of 338 m (taken from the 
navigation charts), raises up at 1,4 km to the South-East of the 
site.

The predominating wind direction was estimated as north-
western.
2.

No traces of animal colonies in the vicinity were noticed.

The refuge is equipped with two buildings: a PDKO-type Soviet pre-fabricated hut and a Bulgarian pre-fabricated house,
adapted to polar conditions. It offers minimum conditions for
accomodation and work, as well as provisions for 4 men for about
100 days, which are presumed to be still in good order (see list
attached).
