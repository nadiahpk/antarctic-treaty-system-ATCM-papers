Italy and the International Scientific Collaboration in Researches on the 
Depletion of the Ozone Layer

Italy and the International Scientific Collaboration in Researches on the Depletion of the
Ozone Layer

The Antarctic is a privileged place for the study and understanding of the climatic and
environmental conditions that concern Planet Earth. We can obtain useful information about
the negative effects on the environment caused by the industrial activities from the compari-
son between those that should be the natural lines of tendency of the environmental scales
and the actual measured values.

The depletion of the ozone layer surrounding our planet increases in the Antarctic es-
pecially in spring, resulting in one of the most urgent problems in the field of studies in under-
standing the global changes in the geosphere with possible, important consequences for the
biosphere and for the conditions of life on our planet.

As to concern the measures of the ozone's depletion, Italy has started, some years ago,
the following international collaborations.

-   since 1987 - Researches with Lidar in the South Pole together with the United States;
-   since 1988 - Researches with Lidar at Dumont D'Urville together with France;
-   since 1988 - Researches with BREWER in the Scott Base together with New Zealand;
-   since 1990 - Researches on the Antarctic clouds with meteorological baloons at Mc
Murdo together with the United States;
-   since 1991 - Researches with BREWER in the Antarctic peninsula together with Ar-
gentina.

The collaboration's agreements imply scientific and organizative support of both part-
ners in order to ensure the correct financing and use of the instruments, the scientific data
must be at the disposal of both parts and all the publications of one part must emphasize the
participation of the other.

The collaboration relations have been very positive resulting for instance in a tech-
nological development of the Lidar: operative since 1991 in Dumont d'Urville which is the
only Italian technological instrument that operates in Antarctica in the frame of the Network
for Detection of Stratospheric Changes (NDSC). This is a network of 5 stations operating in
the whole world, with the most sophisticated instruments for the evaluation of the significant
parameters of the stratosphere and its component in order to measure possible processes of
changement on a global scale.
