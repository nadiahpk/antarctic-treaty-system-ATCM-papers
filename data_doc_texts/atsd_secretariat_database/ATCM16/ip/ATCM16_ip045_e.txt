CHAPTER 1

General conditions and peculiarities of flight in the Antarctic

1.1 Postal address of AIS (Aeronautical Information Services):
AIS HQ
Leningradskyi Prospekt 37, Block 3
125836 Moscow 167

Telephone: 492-82-81. Telex & Fax: nil.

1.2. Soviet aviation acting in support of USSR Antarctic expeditions operates practically everywhere in the perimeter of the Antarctic, while particular mention can be made of air support to the "Vostok" continental scientific base. There are also flights deep into the continent in the service of various scientific programmes.

1.3. Antarctic airspace as part of uncontrolled airspace.

1.3.1 Air traffic control areas are not established as areas of responsibility for Air Traffic Services in the Antarctic, the only boundaries set being those for two-way ATS communications in the en-route phase of flights:

Maputu-Molodyozhnaya                  - abeam Crozet I.
Molodyozhnaya-Novolazarevskaya        - Showa base
                                      - King Baudouin base
Molodyozhnaya-Mirnyi                  - Maudheim base
Mirnyi-Vostok                         - not designated

1.3.2 No boundaries have been established for the aerodrome areas of Molodyozhnaya, Mirnyi, Novolazarevskaya, Druzhnaya-3 and Druzhnaya-4 aerodromes, and in practice what is considered is the effective range of MF pilot-controller communications.

1.3.3 The basic air routes are those listed at para. 1.3.1. Routings for flights in support of scientific programmes are worked out on a customer-request basis.
1.3.4 Flight containment areas.
Flights in Antarctica are contained within boundaries dictated by ecological consideration for 
penguin colonies, nesting areas of other birds and marine animal breeding grounds.

1.4 Fundamental conditions of flight operation:
- operation in the southern hemisphere;
- poor coverage of the Antarctic by meteorological and air navigation services;
- very-long-range operation;
- severe weather conditions;
- the existence of the "polar cap" within which geomagnetic anomalies affect radio 
propagation in all wavebands:
- use of snow-and-ice aerodromes;
- operation in conditions of low temperatures, strong winds, and "white-out";
- operation over the sea or over areas without landmarks;
- operation from scientific seagoing vessels;
- flights with selection of landing site from the air.

1.5 Molodyozhnaya AvMet Centre, Mirnyi observatory, Progress Station

1.5.1 Other stations of the Soviet Antarctic expedition used for reception and relay of 
information from stations operating in the VHF and UHF bands.

1.6 Scientific expedition vessels:
Akademik Fyodorov, Mikhail Somov, Vitus Bering, Arsenyev, Navarrin, Ivan Papanin.

5.3 Altimeter setting procedure

The pressure altitude of aircraft is determined during flight operations:

With reference to aerodrome atmospheric pressure (QNH) while flying aerodrome patterns at or below trasition altitude, in the aerodrome area:

- in the en-route phase, at altitudes below the minimum flight level, with reference to the minimum atmospheric pressure along the route (or sector thereof), brought down to sea level;

- at or above transition flight level - with reference to international standard atmosphere 760 mm (1013.2 mb).
33

When taxiing out, the crew must set the pointers of the barometric altimeters to "zero" 
altitude and compare the value on the pressure scale with the value of atmospheric pressure 
at the aerodrome.

When climbing to cruising level, the pressure scale of the barometric altimeter is re-
set from the aerodrome QNH to the value 760 before transition altitude.

Before the approach for landing, the pressure scale of the barometric altimeter is re-
set from the value 760 to the aerodrome QNH in horizontal flight at the transition flight level 
after clearance by the traffic controller to continue descending, in the sequence: pilot-in-
command, second pilot, navigator.

For en-route flight at altitudes below the minimum flight level, the pressure scale of 
the barometric altimeter is re-set from the aerodrome QNH to the value corresponding to the 
minimum atmospheric pressure along the route brought down to sea level, on leaving the 
take-off and landing area (of the aerodrome flight circuit).

When approaching the aerodrome at altitudes below the minimum flight level, the 
pressure scale of the barometric altimeter is re-set from the value corresponding to the 
minimum atmospheric pressure along the route, brought down to sea level, to the aerodrome 
QNH, when entering the take-off and landing area (aerodrome flight circuit) at the 
aerodromes used by local air traffic.

Before flying out from an aerodrome situated in a flat or hilly locality where there is no 
AvMet station, the crew determines the pressure according to the pressure scale of the 
barometric altimeter, whose pointers should be set for the absolute height of the aerodrome.

At aerodromes in mountainous localities, with atmospheric pressure at runway level 
less than the maximum value which can be set on the pressure scale of the barometric 
altimeter it is necessary:

- before take-off to set the aerodrome pressure value brought down to sea level. In this 
instance the indication on the altimeter is taken as "Reference 0", for selection and 
maintenance of altitude;

- before landing, the traffic controller informs the crew of the absolute height of the 
aerodrome and the value of the aerodrome's atmospheric pressure, brought down to sea level, 
which the crew sets into the altimeters, approaches for landing being then conducted in the
knowledge that the altimeters will be showing the absolute height of the flight, and at the 
moment of landing the aerodrome's height above sea level.

CHAPTER 6. ALERTING, SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES

Emergency and rescue operations are organized and carried out in the following 
circumstances:

- when a message is received about the imminent landing of an aircraft in distress;

- air accidents;

- forewarning of a possible air accident, if evacuation of the aircraft is a requirement;

- rendering assistance to the population in the event of natural disasters;

- when required by other organizations and departments in accordance with the mutual 
assistance plan;

- when instructed by the station chief or senior official.

The immediate direction of emergency rescue operations on and in the area of the 
aerodrome is the responsibility of the station chief or other official appointed by him. The 
director of emergency rescue operations is responsible for taking prompt measures to rescue 
the passengers and crews of aircraft in distress, for conducting emergency rescue operations 
on and in the area of aerodromes, and for ensuring a constant state of readiness of persons 
and equipment assigned to these tasks.

Depending on the situation, emergency rescue teams must obey the following signals:

- "Alert"- when an air accident has suddenly occurred or when less than 30 minutes 
remain before an aircraft in distress is expected to land at an aerodrome.

- "Readiness" - when 30 minutes or more remain before an aircraft in distress is 
expected to land at an aerodrome.

To carry out emergency rescue operations on and in the area of an aerodrome, each 
shift at an aerodrome includes a rescue team under special instructions.
