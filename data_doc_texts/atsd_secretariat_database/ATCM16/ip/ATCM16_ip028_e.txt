The Italian Antarctic Data-Exchange System

The need to secure the access and the exchange of data from Antarctic expeditions has been 
focused by many countries in the last years.

In the XV Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (Paris, 1989), several nations 
submitted documents recommending the cooperation and the exchange of scientific data.

In the XXI SCAR-Meeting (Sao Paulo, 1990), almost all the Working groups raised 
the problem to set up antarctic data-base related to their own research field.

Italy, following the recommendation of the SCAR, started in 1989 the Project South-
Pole to set up the 

     Italian Antarctic Data-Exchange System.

The project South-Pole is split into two phases.

Phase 1 is close to the end. Its product will be a Directory of all the data and data-
bases coming from the Italian expeditions at Terra Nova bay.

The Directory will be not limited to the major research fields (e.g. geology, 
meteorology), but will contain descriptions of the results from all the Italian researches in 
Antarctica.

Soon, it will be possible to access the Directory South-Pole via the SPAN link. In fact, 
it is in progress to transfer the Directory to the European Space Agency (ESRIN) in Frascati, 
under the P.I.D. (Prototype International Directory).

Phase 2 is about to start. Its goal is to collect data from different research fields in 
selected field centers, to provide both the archiving of the data and the user assistance in data 
handling.

There will be Field Centers for all the research fields Italy is involved in Antarctica, e.g.:

- Biology and Medical Sciences

- Cosmophysics

- Earth Sciences

- Environmental Impact

- Oceanography

- Physics of Earth Atmospohere

- Technology

With this project, Italy's aim is to facilitate the data-exchange not only among different 
researchers of the same field, but also among researchers of different research fields, by 
providing not only compatible data, but also assistance in data handling.
