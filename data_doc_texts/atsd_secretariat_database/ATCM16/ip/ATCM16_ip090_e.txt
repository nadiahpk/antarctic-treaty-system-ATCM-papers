Opening Address
by the Head of the Delegation of Greece,
Dr. Emmanuel Gounaris

Mr. Chairman,
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your election as Chairman for the XVIth
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

I wish also to express the appreciation of my Delegation to the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany for the magnificent hospitality shown to us all during this Consultative
Meeting in the beautiful, already unified Germany.

Mr. Chairman,
On behalf of my Government I would like to express its satisfaction for the adoption and
signing by the majority of the Antarctic Treaty Parties, of the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. During the XVth Antarctic Consultative Meeting in Paris,
and also during the XIth Special Consultative Meeting in Viña del Mar and in Madrid my
Delegation has pointed out views, which in the framework of the above mentioned Protocol
have been justified. Greece can be proud for this outcome.

Mr. Chairman,
The designation of the Antarctic Treaty area as a natural reserve devoted to peace and
science, where mining is prohibited and the environment is subject to a comprehensive
binding regime of protection, will further strengthen the Treaty System.

Greece has already signed this Protocol and will be very soon among those states which will
have ratified this legal instrument. However, Mr. Chairman, it is very important for all the
Antarctic Treaty Parties to apply provisionally the Environmental Protocol from now.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Governments of Chile and Spain for the
Secretariat facilities provided as well as the magnificent hospitality shown to us all in Viña del
Mar and in Madrid throughout the negotiations. My thanks go also to Ambassador Andersen
of Norway for the elaboration of the Environmental Protocol.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
