1       Introduction

Since XV ATCM in October 1989 WMO has conducted a number of
activities with outcomes relevant to Antarctic Treaty
discussions:

        (a)     An Expert Meeting on Antarctic Telecommunications in
Geneva in December 1989.

        (b)     The fifth session of the WMO Executive Council
Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology (EC-WGAM-V) 
in Geneva in December 1990 (This body meets only
every four years)

        (c)     Initial discussion of Antarctic matters by WMO
Executive Council (EC-XLII) in May 1990 and
subsequent consideration of the EC-WGAM-V report by
WMO Eleventh Congress (Cg XI) and EC XLIII in May
1991.

Copies of the Reports (a) and (b) above have been made
available to Permanent Representatives of WMO and through
them to Managers of National Antarctic Programs.

The principal results of these meetings and briefly
described in the following paragraphs.  The question of
marine and aviation meteorological services in the
Antarctic are the subject of a separate paper to be
considered under Agenda Items 16 and 18 respectively.

2       Meteorological Observations and Networks

The current Antarctic surface and upper air reporting
network as established by EC-WGAM-V and subsequently
amended as shown in Attachment 1.  The network is less than
ideal and observations are particularly required in the
Pacific sector of West Antarctica.

The importance of automatic weather stations (AWS) and
buoys is emphasised and, in particular, the transmission of
their data whenever possible on the Global
Telecommunication System (GTS).  The initiative of the
World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) in launching a co-
operative International Antarctic Drifting Buoy Project in
the Antarctic sea ice zone should be noted and the co-
operation of Treaty Parties is sought.  EC-XLIII adopted 2
resolutions (Attachments 2 and 3) in giving additional
attention to Antarctic observations.

3       Telecommunication Systems in the Antarctic

The reliability of receipt of Antarctic data at particular
meteorological centres outside the Antarctic has shown
improvement between 1987 and 1989.  In December 1989 the 
level of availability of expected SYNOP (surface weather) 
reports within 3 hours of observation was about 85% while 
that for TEMP (upper air) reports within 12 hours of 
observation was about 68%.

EC-WGAM-V, Cg-XI and EC-XLIII essentially endorsed the 
report of the Expert Meeting on Telecommunications of 
December 1989 which had outlined principles for the 
collection and distribution of Antarctic meteorological 
information. These place significantly more emphasis on 
the maximum use of satellite based communication systems. 
Antarctic observing and collecting stations into the GTS by 
using satellite techniques and data collection platforms 
(DCPs) are being used to transmit data from Antarctic 
stations to receiving centres maintained by meteorological 
satellite operators for subsequent insertion into the GTS.

It is recognised however that for various reasons the 
collection of Antarctic data still needs to be improved and 
available information shows that the reliability of some 
circuits varies from 60% to near 100%. WMO will continue 
to carry out monitoring and will hold a further Expert 
Meeting of Telecommunication Experts in October 1991 aimed 
at accelerating improvements in procedures and techniques 
for data transmission and exchange.  The current links for 
international data exchange within the Antarctic and the 
principal links by which Antarctic meteorological data 
enter the GTS were identified by EC-WGAM-V and amended by 
later information.  These are shown in Attachments 4 and 5 
respectively.

4    The Role of Antarctica in Understanding and Monitoring 
     Global Change including the Ozone Layer

Antarctica is recognised as particularly important as a 
region for detecting any early signals of climate change 
and the work of the Second World Climate Conference and the 
recent proposal to create a Global Climate Observing System 
(GCOS) indicates that the Antarctic Treaty parties could 
play an important role in further developing and 
maintaining at a high standard the observing systems in the 
region.  In particular, EC-XLIII urged members of WMO to 
ensure continuity and integrity of observations at 
Antarctic stations by keeping changes in stations and 
locations to an absolute minimum.

The importance of ozone monitoring in the Antarctic was 
emphasised in EC-WGAM-V report and the need for more 
balloon-borne ozone soundings was noted.

Cg-XI urged WMO members to continue with their Antarctic 
ozone programs and in particular to carry out measurements 
of atmospheric composition on a continuous basis thus 
contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch network for 
detecting changes not only in ozone but also in the 
greenhouse gases and the transport and characteristics of 
pollutants and aerosols.
5     UN Resolution 45/78A on the Question of Antarctica

This resolution seeks the performance of a comprehensive 
study by the Secretary General of the UN with the 
assistance of UNEP and WMO into the establishment of a UN 
sponsored observatory station in Antarctica and further 
seeks a report on the state of the Antarctic Environment. 
The matter was considered by Cg XI which agreed to 
provision of advice by WMO particularly on the location of 
the station if funding became available from UN or other 
sources and also agreed to WMO contributing information on 
the ozone, climate and atmospheric component of the 
proposed Environmental Report in collaboration with UNEP.

6     WMO Long Term Plan

Cg XI agreed that a new component entitled WMO Antarctic 
Activities should be included in the World Weather Watch 
Programme as a special section of the Third Long Term Plan.

7     External Co-operation

Cg XI noted the work of EC-WGAM and stated that it believed 
that interaction between WMO and ATCM/SCAR had been 
fruitful and should be continued.  It also stressed that 
close co-operation between WMO Permanent Representatives 
and Managers of Antarctic Programs in individual countries 
is essential and should be promoted.  EC-XLIII decided to 
continue EC-WGAM with revised terms of reference which 
include the requirement for it to provide as necessary 
information to ATCM and to maintain active contacts with 
other relevant Antarctic bodies including SCAR.  (see 
Attachment 6).
