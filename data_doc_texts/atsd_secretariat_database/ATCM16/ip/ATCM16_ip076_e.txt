Cooperation in the Hydrographic Charting of Antarctic Waters     

(Item 17)     

(submitted by SCAR)     
Cooperation in the Hydrographic Charting of Antarctic Waters

At the XV Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Recommendation XV-19 was passed that members would recommend to their respective Governments that:

*   They increase mutual cooperation in the hydrographic survey and charting of Antarctic waters; and
*   They coordinate their activities within appropriate frameworks;

The position of the SCAR Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic Information on this matter is:

1.  Hydrographic surveying and charting should be clearly included in the program of mutual cooperation in the Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic Information.
2.  A representative from the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) should be invited to join the SCAR Working Group, at least with observer status.
3.  The current SCAR map catalogue includes listings of Hydrographic charts and Bathymetric maps. If IHO has gathered a more complete listing through their status survey, then this information should be incorporated in the SCAR catalogue in digital form before the XXII SCAR Meeting to be held at Bariloche, Argentina in June 1992.
4.  The availability and supply sources for each Hydrographic chart should be more clearly defined in any catalogue upgrade so that users can readily purchase the latest published information for marine navigation.
5.  The coordination, and recording of tide gauge results should also be clearly defined as within the scope of the Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic Information.
