Nordic Cooperation in Antarctic Operations
(Item 13 (a))
(submitted by Finland)
SCIENTIFIC AND LOGISTIC COOPERATION BETWEEN NORDIC COUNTRIES

Three Nordic countries Finland, Norway and Sweden, which are the consultative parties among 
the Antarctic Treaty countries, have agreed on cooperation in transportation the expeditions to 
their Antarctic stations. Each country will in turn have the responsibility of arranging 
transportation to the Antarctic.

Finland starts the system in coming season. A commercial contract between the Ministry of 
Trade and Industry in Finland and the Arctic and Antarctic Research Intitute (AARI) in St. 
Petersburg (Leningrad) was signed in December last year. According to the contract the AARI 
will transport the cargo and the personnel of Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish Antarctic 
expeditions to their stations ABOA, TROLL and WASA and back home by the R/V 
AKADEMIK FEDOROV.

The Nordic Antarctic cooperation was started earlier: remarkable was the basing Finnish and 
Swedish stations ABOA and WASA in Queen Maud Land in season 1988-89. Sweden offered 
the transportation of the Finnish station by their ship. Next season Finnish research vessel 
ARANDA owned by the Finnish Institute of Marine Research carried Finnish and Swedish land 
personnel to the stations, which have a common name Nordenskiöld Base. A few Swedish 
scientists were on board working together with Finnish marine scientists.

At the moment cooperation concerns mainly transportation. It seems obvious that the scientists 
will develop more and more joint work when they are offered logistical chances. When the 
rotating transportation system is continuing on regular basis, the scientists will trust on the 
possibilities to continue their cooperation.

Cooperation is very natural between the Nordic countries. We have old tradition of cooperation 
in many fields. We all are very small nations. If the expedition were carried out every year 
alone, it would be too expensive, and a reasonable size of an expedition would be binding too. 
great amount of those scientists who should carry out research also in Arctic and sub-Arctic 
areas.

Norway will be responsible for transportation in the season 1992-93. According to the preliminary plans the expedition will be emphasized on marine reseach. The aim is to develop 
the scientific cooperation between Nordic scientists during the expedition.
