OPENING ADDRESS BY THE HEAD OF THE DELEGATION OF ECUADOR

Mr. Chairman,

In extending to you the greetings of the Government of Ecuador, I should like to convey my thanks, through your goodself, to the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany for his words of welcome to my country in his opening address to this XVIth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, which is the first Ordinary Consultative Meeting Ecuador has attended in its capacity as a Consultative Party.

It is very significant that, as the 30th anniversry of the Antarctic Treaty comes to be commemorated, the Protocol on Environmental Protection and its Annexes should have been approved in Madrid, thereby furnishing yet another legal argument in favour of the conservation of Antarctica as a natural region that is unique in the world.

Mr. Chairman,

Ecuador will complete all the domestic constitutional and legal procedures needed to give effect to the Protocol and will faithfully abide by the stipulations of the Protocol and its Annexes in the activities in which it engages in Antarctica.

I should like to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on your election to your high office and, through you, to thank the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the
curtesies shown to our Delegation.

Thank you.
