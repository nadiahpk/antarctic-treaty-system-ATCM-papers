EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1991/92
GREENPEACE ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION

Submitted by ASOC on behalf of its member organisation
Greenpeace International
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
FOR 1991/92

SUBMITTED BY GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL
October 1991
===========================================================

GREENPEACE ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION 1991/92

Provision of Information to States party to the Antarctic Treaty
Please refer to the Annex to Recommendation VIII-6.

I. Equipment

Greenpeace will be using one vessel, the MV GONDWANA, on its
Antarctic expedition. The MV Gondwana was formerly named MV
VIKING, and operated out of the Finnish port of Naantali as a
supply vessel in the Baltic and North Seas, and the Gulfs of
Finland and Bothnia. The 61.2 metre vessel has a gross registered
tonnage of 1435 tonnes, net 430 tonnes, with propulsion power of
8,600 BHP, giving a surface speed of 12 knots at 12 tons of
diesel per day. The MV GONDWANA was built in West Germany in 1975
and purchased by Greenpeace in 1988. The ship carries no
armaments.

The MV GONDWANA is in class "DNV 1A1 Ice 1B," the highest ice
classification short of icebreaker, and has a double skin. The
ship is registered in The Netherlands as a sea-going yacht.

II. Itinerary

The 1991/92 expedition will consist only of one round-trip leg,
and World Park Base removal procedures will begin immediately
upon arrival at Cape Evans. The itinerary for the MV GONDWANA to
and from the Antarctic cannot be precisely defined as it will
depend on ice conditions. The approximate schedule, however, is
as follows:

Dept.     Auckland, New Zealand              20 December 1991
Arr.      Cape Evans, Ross Sea               1  January 1992

Dept.     Cape Evans, Ross Sea               5  March 1992
Arr.      Auckland, New Zealand              15 March 1992

III. World Park Base

World Park Base, at Cape Evans, Ross Island (77 deg 38' S, 166
deg 24' E), has been occupied continuously through 1987, 1988,
1989, 1990 and 1991.  The base will be dismantled and removed
during the 1991/92 season.

VI. Work Programme

The 1991/92 Greenpeace Antarctic expedition will concentrate on the removal of World Park Base. The operation will begin upon arrival of the MV GONDWANA at Cape Evans, and will last 6 to 8 weeks. An extensive monitoring programme will be undertaken to investigate and document the effects of World Park Base on the surrounding area. Finally, a small independent mobile team will be deployed in several locations to study human impacts on the Antarctic environment, and carry out inspections of stations. A draft Initial Environmental

2
Evaluation (IEE) has been drawn up for the planned 1991/92 
activities, and will be available at the XVIth ATCM in Bonn. 
Comments from Treaty nations will be taken into account, and a 
final version of the document will be available in November.

The on-going ship-based scientific program will consist of 
records on whale sightings for migration studies and population 
assessment; records on iceberg sightings for ice sheet mass 
balance studies; and a project to provide data on glacio-marine 
sedimentation processes. Monitoring and documenting of human 
impact will continue.

A more detailed report on the overall Greenpeace science program 
will soon be available.

VII. Scientific Equipment

The expedition carries only basic scientific equipment, including 
microscopes and measuring equipment.

VIII. Transportation/Communications

A. Transport:

The following items of transportation equipment are carried by 
the expedition:

    a) Air Transport

The expedition will carry 2 Hughes 500D helicopters. The 
helicopters will be used when necessary, i.e. for ice spotting, 
transport of field parties, and especially for transportation of 
supplies to World Park Base during the removal operation, as well 
as for transportation of materials to be retrograded from the 
base. The helicopters will return with the MV GONDWANA to New 
Zealand. (See Annex 3)

    b) Surface Transport

World Park Base uses three Bombardier Alpine 503 skidoos, one 
Nansen sled, one man haul sled and one box sled for surface 
transport. All surface transport will all be returned to New 
Zealand at the end of the 1991/92 summer season.

    c) Marine Transport

Other than life boats and life rafts, the MV GONDWANA will carry 
two 4.5m inflatables (50 hp outboard), one 6m semi-rigid 
inflatable (75 hp outboard), and one 5m aluminium work boat (75 hp 
outboard).

B: Communications facilities (See Annex 1)

ANNEX 2

(Pursuant to Rec XV-3)

WASTE MANAGEMENT WORLD PARK BASE

1.  Waste Classification

1.1 Solid wastes
- organics (food scraps)
- paper/cardboard
- wood
- glass
- aluminium cans
- tins
- plastics and rubber products
- batteries
- contaminated soil
- other - scrap metal, used equipment, etc.

1.2 Liquid wastes, excluding sewage and grey water
- photographic chemicals
- other chemicals
- waste fuels and waste oils

1.3 Sewage and grey water
- human wastes (sewage)
- grey water (from wash basins, showers, washing machine,
  kitchen sink)

2.  Waste Management

2.1 World Park Base

All wastes are retrograded with the exception of grey water.
Human wastes are composted and stored. Any recyclable items are
stored separately.

2.2 Refuges and Field Parties

All wastes, including human wastes, are retrograded from field
trips to the base or refuges. All wastes, including human wastes
are stored at refuges and retrograded at resupply.

7
2.3     Vessel MV GONDWANA

Sewage and grey water are treated in the ship's facilities before 
discharge.  The internal sewage treatment complies with US Coast 
Guard standards for discharge into coastal waters, estuaries, 
interconnected waterways, and fresh water lakes. Sewage sludge is 
kept in tanks until disposed of in port.

Food scraps generated north of the Antarctic Convergence are 
thrown overboard there. South of the Convergence, food scraps are 
separated and stored for disposal at the first port of call, 
north of the Convergence.  Generally, these food scraps are 
disposed of in New Zealand.

Oil-water separation of bilge water complies with International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulations. Waste oil is stored 
until a port of call outside of the Antarctic. All other solid 
and liquid wastes are separated, and stored to ports of call 
outside the Antarctic where they are either recycled or disposed 
of.

2.4     Restricted Materials

Organic starter material for the composting toilet is imported to 
World Park Base, subject to a permit. All the composted material 
is retrograded.

2.5     Notes

No radioactive materials are used.

3.  Inventory of Locations of Past Activities

A field camp was removed from Marble Point in 1990/91.

All field depots in the McMurdo Sound area will be removed in the 
1991/92 season.

Cape Evans already is a site of past activities from many 
expeditions.  The removal of World Park Base will be carried out 
following the principle of total retrograding. The monitoring 
programme for the site will continue in the future.  The exact 
location of past base structures, and the ongoing monitoring will 
be distributed to the Antarctic community.
