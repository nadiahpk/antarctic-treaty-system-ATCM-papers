OPENING ADDRESS BY MRS.KIRSTEN SANDER,
DANISH REPRESENTATIVE, TO THE XVIth ANTARCTIC TREATY
CONSULTATIVE MEETING

Mr Chairman,

The Danish delegation is very pleased to attend this XVIth Consultative Meeting here
in Bonn. We congratulate you on your election and look forward to a constructive and fruitful
outcome of the agenda which contains many matters of great importance.

The Danish delegation expecially looks forward to the implementation of the
Environmental Protocol with annexes to the Antarctic Treaty, which the Treaty Parties have
negotiated to a successful conclusion. With the signing of this Protocol the Treaty Parties are
sending a strong signal to the world community that they are serious about protecting of the
unique Antarctic environment. Now action must follow our words.

The protection of the environment is a key issue for Denmark; since Denmark joined
the Treaty "family", we have advocated comprehensive protection of the Antarctic region. We
know from experience in the Arctic region how fragile the Polar regions can be. The
introduction of environmental impact assessment procedures for Antarctic operations as a
tool to prevent damage to the environment, is a priority procedure to be implemented as soon
as possible.

With the increasing level of activities in the Antarctic, both scientific and touristic, it is
imperative that the provisions in the Protocol are implemented forthwith; we cannot wait
until the Protocol is legally in force.

Furthermore, this increase in activities, increased exchange of information
requirements, the move towards annual Treaty Meetings, filing of EIAs and Meeting Reports
etc, will demand increased efficiency and management of the Treaty Consultative Meetings.

The Danish delegation supports the notion of a secretariat to service these tasks.
Therefore such a body would prove particularly helpful for Non-Consultative Parties.

The Danish delegation emphasizes the urgency of elaborating the annexes on
protected areas and liability; the spirit of the Environmental Protocol should also be applied
to the conclusion of these annexes.
The Danish delegation looks forward to the further development of the cooperative 
spirit which has been such a key element during the first thirty years of the Treaty. It is 
important that the Treaty System shows itself to be open to criticism, transparent in 
management and efficient; we must make our achievements publicly known and available.

Thank you Mr.Chairman
