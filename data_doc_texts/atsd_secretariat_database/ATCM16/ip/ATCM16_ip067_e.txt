Antarctic Inspection Checklist

(submitted by the United States)
Information Paper Submitted by U.S.

The United States developed an environmental inspection checklist for use during its
1989 Antarctic inspection.
  This checklist was circulated at ATCM XV for the information übaof delegations.
It is recirculated here to facilitate discussion of agenda item 8.

Because of widespread interest in this subject, the U.S. suggests that this checklist, or 
another version which might be developed as a result of our discussions, appear as an annex 
to the report of the XVI ATCM.
