REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE XIth ANTARCTIC TREATY SPECIAL
CONSULTATIVE MEETING
(Viña del Mar)

Distinguished Representatives,

In my capacity as Chairman of the XIth Antarctic Treaty
Special Consultative Meeting, I am called upon to submit to you
the Provisional Report placing on record the proceedings of the
meeting held in the Chilean city of Viña del Mar from 19 November
to 6 December 1990.

I have little to add to the document itself, which was
published and circulated in Spanish and English in early 1991, but
that little is important.

We came to Viña del Mar deeply divided, but we left with hopes
of coming to an arrangement that could be adopted by consensus.

Commentators claimed that those hopes were very faint and yet
it subsequently proved possible to reach unanimous agreement.

As Chairman of that meeting, I should like to thank all those
who showed proof of goodwill in their bid to ensure that the
Antarctic spirit would triumph - those who thought that between a
short-term moratorium on mining and an unconditional ban, it was
possible to set up a review mechanism drawing its inspiration from
Article XII of the Antarctic Treaty.

If I had to single out the names of two representatives
personifying the goodwill displayed by one or other of the
tendencies, I would cite those of Curtiss Bohlen, of the United
States, and Jean-Pierre Puissochet, of France.

I have kept the hand-written drafts of the two of them. When
we come to read between the lines of those drafts, with their
connecting passages, crossings-out and amendments, we can see that
the Protocol now pointing new ways to protect the continent of
2

Antarctica had already taken shape in Viña del Mar in November and 
December 1990.

Thank you.

(Oscar Pinochet de la Barra)
