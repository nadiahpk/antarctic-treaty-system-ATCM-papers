SCALOP Oil Spill Recommendations to COMNAP

REVISED

Rec 1

MNAPs consider the adoption, within their competence of minimum standards of ice
navigation experience for the Masters and Chief Officers of vessels operating under
charter or in support of their Antarctic operations, and such minimum standards to be
developed by SCALOP for MNAPs endorsement.

Rec 2

MNAPs agree:

i) to the use of light, nonpersistent fuels in the Antarctic Treaty area
wherever practical and possible; and

ii) specify engines using light diesel fuel for the construction of new vessels
intended for service in the Antarctic.

Rec 3

MNAPs consider the adoption, within their competence, of the following measures
based on Article 3 (Oil Pollution Emergency Plans) as presented at the IMO
conference on International Cooperation on Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response,
1990 and:

i) ensure that vessels operating under charter or in support of their Antarctic
operation carry a shipboard oil pollution management plan, such plans to
be developed by 31 December 1995;

ii) assess the existence, persistence, nature, extent and possible consequences
of oil spill incidents either offshore or onshore in Antarctica;

and, in addition,

iii) immediately report all serious Antarctic oil spillage, whether from ships
or onshore, through the COMNAP/SCALOP secretary for advice to all
COMNAP and SCALOP members.

Rec 4

Recognizing the importance of having accurate hydrographic charts available to the 
Masters of Antarctic vessels in order to enhance the safety of ship operations and 
minimize the risk of marine pollution incidents in Antarctica, it is recommended that 
MNAP's:

i)      identify areas of greatest need for the preparation of accurate hydrographic charts;

ii)     coordinate with their respective national hydrographic agencies and the 
        International Hydrographic Organization for the preparation of such charts and

iii)    ensure that the Masters of vessels supporting their program have the best available 
        charts for use.

Rec 5

MNAPs agree to:

i)      consider, within their competence, the adoption of specific operating 
        procedures for the transfer of fuel oil to and within oil storage facilities; 
        and of specific minimum requirements for the design, construction and 
        modification of fuel oil storage facilities;

ii)     review the specific operating procedures and minimum requirements as 
        developed by SCALOP and to submit comments by February 1992.

iii)    consider at the 1992 COMNAP meeting the adoption of these operating 
        procedures and minimum requirements.

Rec 6

MNAPs:

i)      accept for current use the draft standard formats and procedures for 
        Contingency Plans as developed by SCALOP;

ii)     submit comments by the end of February 1992, and

iii)    at the 1992 meeting review and adopt the formats and procedures for 
        Contingency Plans.

Rec 7                                            3

Each MNAP to develop Facility/Area Contingency Plans, at least to draft stage, by 31 
December 1992 for circulation prior to the 1993 COMNAP/SCALOP meetings.

Rec 8

With regard to the Meeting of Experts noted in ATCM Recommendation XV-4 it is recommended that:

    i)      the matters of polar vessel classification for new construction and the 
            setting of minimum standards for vessels to be used in the Antarctic be 
            referred by the ATCM to the International Maritime Organization for 
            consideration; and

    ii)     the question of a liability regime to apply in the event of a pollution 
            incident be considered by the ATCM in the context of the prospective 
            Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection and its 
            Annex on Marine Pollution; while

   iii)     the topics of Antarctic oil spill contingency planning and response 
            equipment be handled directly by COMNAP/SCALOP.
