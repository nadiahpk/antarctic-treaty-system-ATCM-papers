Draft Recommendation

Antarctic Protected Area System: New Historic Sites and Monuments

(Item 11 h)

(submitted by Chile and the United Kingdom)
Draft Recommendation
Antarctic Protected Area Sysem:
New Historic Sites and Monuments

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-10, V-4, VI-14, VII-9, XII-7, XIII-16 and XIV-8;

Recommend to their Governments that the following historic site (monument) be added to the 'List of Historic Monuments Identified and Described by the Proposing Government or Governments' annexed to Recommendation VII-9 and that thereafter it be accorded the respect and protection required by the Recommendations recalled above:

56. Waterboat Point, Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula (64°49'S, 62°52'W). The remains and immediate environs of the Waterboat Point hut, situated close to the unoccupied Chilean station, 'Presidente Gabriel González Videla'. The Waterboat Point hut, of which only the base of the boat, roots of door posts and an outline of the hut and extension still exist, was occupied by the UK two-man expedition of Bagshawe and Lester in 1921-22. This was, and indeed remains, the smallest expedition to ever overwinter in Antarctica.
INFORMATION NOTE: WATERBOAT POINT, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA.

1.    Waterboat Point, Danco Coast (64°49'S, 62°51'W) is the site where the two-man expedition of T W Bagshawe and M C Lester overwintered in 1921-22 (Fig 1).

2.    Bagshawe, a geologist, and Lester, a merchant service officer, were the advance party of an ambitious survey expedition which failed to materialise (Lester 1923; Bagshawe 1939). Determined to justify the time and money they had spent in getting to Antarctica, the two men decided to remain for a year, living from 12 January 1921 to 13 January 1922 in a makeshift hut fabricated from an old waterboat left stranded by the Whaling Factory ship NEKO about eight years before. (Fig 2).

3.    Though living in cramped and uncomfortable conditions, they maintained a vigorous scientific programme, securing the first year round meteorological records from this sector of the coast, and making tidal, sea ice and biological observations, including a valuable record of the breeding behaviour of Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguins (Bagshawe, 1938). Their data provided interesting comparisons with those gained earlier and further south by Charcot's expeditions. Bagshawe and Lester's expedition was unusual in being supported logistically by Norwegian whalers whose summer operations were extensive at that time. It was, and indeed remains, the smallest expedition ever to overwinter in Antarctica.

4.    Waterboat Point marks the western most point of a peninsula emerging from a glacier face. The remains of the hut can still be seen, close to sea level in a gulley on the larger of two offlying islands. Only the base of the boat, roots of doors posts and an outline of the extension remain. The rest of the boat and its extension appear to have been burnt. (Stonehouse, 1991).

5.    The same island accommodates an unoccupied Chilean station, Presidente Gabriel González Videla. The location of the hut remains is not marked on the Chilean hydrographic chart of the area (No 1505 Caleta Gloria 1: 4000 1951, revised 1953. Since the Chilean Air Force intends to refurbish and use the Base in the future, it is essential to protect, what remains of the relics of a small courageous British expedition living and working in extremely frugal conditions.
