Draft Recommendation

Extended Coverage of the Annual Report
(Agenda item 7)

The Representatives,

Considering that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties adopt in their domestic legislation
rules designed to regulate the many
and varied activities conducted in Antarctica;

Conscious of the fact that, in many instances, this domestic legislation covers such subjects as
protection of the Antarctic environment, harbour and airport charges for shipping and aircraft
used for Antarctic operations on own account or for third parties, and customs, tax and
immigration exemptions;

Convinced that knowledge of this domestic legislation can be of interest to the other
Consultative Parties;

Recommend to their Governments that:

The Annual Report, established by Recommendation VIII-6 for the purpose of exchanging
information on activities, include information on individual countries'domestic legislation,
administrative documents and other rules or legal provisions dealing with Antarctica, which
may been deemed to be of interest to the other Consultative Parties.
