Draft Recommendation on the Antarctic Treaty Handbook

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION ON THE ANTARCTIC TREATY HANDBOOK
(submitted by Argentina)

The Representatives,

Considering the importance of ensuring the proper dissemination and distribution of the
decisions and proceedings of the Meetings of the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty;

Recognizing the important work performed unofficially for that purpose over the years by the
Delegation of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and in particular by the Head of that
Delegation;

Having regard to the usefulness and importance for the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty of an
official publication available in the four official working languages;

Recalling Recommendation XII-6, and in particular paragraph 3 thereof, whereby each
Contracting Party whose Government has acted as host to a Consultative Meeting is entrusted
with updating and preparing the "Handbook of the Antarctic Treaty System";

Recommend to their Governments that:

1. They set up a working group to consider the question of the drafting and official
publication of an Antarctic Treaty Handbook in the four official languages.

2. They engage at the earliest possible opportunity in direct consultations through
diplomatic channels, with a view to preparing the meeting this would entail, which should be
held during the XVIIth Consultative Meeting.

3. With that in mind, they consider the official documents of the Consultative Meetings
which could be used as a basis for that work, together with any other material deemed
relevant.
