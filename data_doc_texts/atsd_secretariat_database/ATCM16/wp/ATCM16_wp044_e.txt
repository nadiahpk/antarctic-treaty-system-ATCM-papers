COMPILATION OF AN ATLAS OF TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS OF
ANTARCTIC STATIONS

(item 17)

(submitted by the USSR Delegation)
Since the Antarctic Treaty came into operation, many member countries have worked steadily 
to provide topographic and geodetic coverage of the base sites and research territories of 
national expeditions. When inspecting Antarctic stations in November-December 1988, the 
Soviet Side was pleased to learn that most of the countries conducting fixed-base research in 
the Antarctic have topographic or construction plans for the stations themselves and their 
adjacent areas.

The Soviet Union attaches the utmost importance to matters involving topographic and 
geodetic coverage of work in the areas of its Antarctic activities. During this past period, 
topographic maps to the scale 1:2 000 have been produced for all Soviet stations in the 
Antarctic. At the Bellingshausen station, apart from the 1:2 000 maps there are 1:10 000 maps 
for the adjacent area. As an example, separate sheets of 1:2000 maps are appended for the 
Molodyozhnaya, Mirnyi, Novolazarevskaya and Bellingshausen stations.

The topographic and geodetic services are currently engaged in updating these topographic 
maps.

In our view, it would be useful to compile an Atlas of topographic maps of the Antarctic 
stations, one purpose of which would be to provide basic information for subsequent 
monitoring of the human impact on the environment at the stations.

In the light of the above:
The Soviet Delegation considers that the XVIth Consultative Meeting could adopt a 
recommendation on the improvement of topographic and geodetic coverage of the Antarctic 
stations with a view to subsequent monitoring of the human impact on the environment.

It proposes the following draft recommendation:

1)	Request SCAR jointly with COMNAP to consider the matter of compiling an Atlas of 
topographic maps of the Antarctic stations, making use of the possibility to involve 
specialists from the national topographic and geodetic services, who could develop a 
single set of technical criteria for accomplishment of the surveying work and 
standardization of the material received.

2)	Request SCAR jointly with COMNAP to set up a working group to carry out the 
preparatory work on the Atlas, covering development of its general structure and 
format.
