DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS:  FORLIDAS POND AND DAVIS VALLEY PONDS

(Working Paper Submitted by the UK Delegation)

MR2ABA/21
ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS, FORLIDAS POND AND DAVIS VALLEY PONDS

The Representatives,

Recalling  Recommendations XV-8 and XV-9;

Noting  that a Management Plan has been prepared and approved
by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR);

Considering  that the Area contains some of the most southerly
freshwater ponds known in Antarctica containing plant life,
and that these ponds and their immediate catchments should be
protected as examples of unique near-pristine ecosystems which
should be afforded maximum protection from human influence;

Recommend  to their Governments that the following Area of
outstanding scientific interest be inserted in Annex B,
Specially Protected Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the
Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, together with the
annexed Management Plan.

Specially Protected Area No 23

Forlidas Pond and Davis Valley Ponds, situated near the east end
of the Dufek Massif at position 82°27'15"S, 51°21'W. The Area
includes smaller ponds that occur along the ice margin at the
northern edge of Davis Valley, a short distance east of Forlidas
Pond.

MR2ABA/22
Proposed Specially Protected Area No.

FORLIDAS POND AND DAVIS VALLEY PONDS

1. Geographical Location
Forlidas Pond, about 100 m in diameter, is situated near the east end of the Dufek Massif in a small unnamed dry valley about 1 km east of the northern edge of Forlidas Ridge and about 1 km northwest of Davis Valley. The unnamed dry valley is separated from Davis Valley by a northeast trending ridge several kilometres long. The position of Forlidas Pond is 82°27'15"S, 51°21' W. The Area includes smaller ponds that occur along the ice margin at the northern edge of Davis Valley, a short distance east of Forlidas Pond.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area consists of two parts, shown on the attached map, about 500 m apart:

A. All that area within 500 m of the centre of Forlidas Pond;

B. All that area within a 500 m radius of several meltwater ponds at the ice margin along the northern edge of Davis Valley.

(ii) Reason for designation
The Area contains some of the most southerly freshwater ponds known in Antarctica containing plant life which would be threatened by possible contamination by human activity. The only visitors to Forlidas Pond have been geologists and geophysicists in 1957 and possibly one or two other parties. The ponds in Davis Valley were visited in 1978 by geologists. No botanists or zoologists have visited the Area. These ponds are located in SRA No. _, North Side of Dufek Massif, which could attract visitors such as scientists or tourists. They should be protected as examples of unique near-pristine freshwater ecosystems and their catchments.

(iii) Date of designation and originator
October, 1991, USA.

(iv) Access points
None specified.

(v) Entry permit requirements
Entry to the Area should be in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere, or for site inspection, and which will not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its 
1
biota within the Area. Details of visits should be included in national annual 
reports of exchange of information for the same Antarctic season in which the 
activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
None specified, but camping and the landing of helicopters should be avoided within 
1 kilometre of the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of 
biota, soil, water, and periglacial features, unless required as specified in the 
permit.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling
Taking of samples of biota or soils should be done only for a compelling scientific 
purpose and must conform strictly with the activities specified in the permit to enter the 
Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance
Inspection visits should be made when opportunity arises to assess the state of the Area 
and to monitor biological and environmental change, and to maintain boundary 
markers, notices, etc.
