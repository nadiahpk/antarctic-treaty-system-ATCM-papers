The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations I-IX, V-4, VI-14 and VII-9,

Recommend to their Governments that the following historic monument be added to the "list of Historic Monuments identified and described by the Proposing Government or Governments annexed to Recommendation VII-9 and thereafter they be accorded the respect and protection required by the Recommendation recalled above:

-   58. Cairn with memorial plaque erected at Whalers' Bay, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, in the vicinity of the whalers' cemetery [ historic monument n° 31 ] latitude 62° 59'S, 60° 34'W, to honour captain Adolfus Amandus Andresen, Antarctic pioneer who was first to establish a whaling operation at Deception Island in 1906.

BACKGROUND

Captain Adolfus Amandus Andresen was born in Sandefjord, Norway. After a number of years at sea, he settled in Punta Arenas where he was active in coastal traffic in Southern Chile. He had noticed the abundance of rorquals and right whales as well as fur-bearing seals around Tierra del Fuego. In order to acquire skill as a gunner he made his way to Finnmark, where he participated in whaling operations. He returned to Chile with a whale gun which he mounted in the bows of a tugboat, and with this he shot a humpback whale on New Years Eve 1903 in the Strait of Magellan: the first "commercial whale" dispatched with modern equipment in the Southern Ocean.

In the spring of 1905, Andresen acquired a new whale catcher from Norway and established a whaling station near Punta Arenas. The results were so promising that he managed to form with his partner Pedro de Bruyne a Chilean company, the Sociedad Ballenera de Magallanes. Two new whale catchers were also purchased and the floating factory Gobernador Bories was fitted out to operate around the South Shetlands where Andresen had discovered the potential of the magnificent harbour on Deception Island.

Andresen was the first person in 1906 to use Deception's Bay as a station for a floating factory. He became the senior citizen at Whaler's Bay (Caleta Balleneros), the outstanding centre of whaling operations in the Western Antarctic, with a population of more than 200 whalers engaged by Chilean and Norwegian companies.

When Charcot visited him, Andresen was able to twice supply his expedition with a generous load of coal from his company's deposit at Deception Island. Also Andresen was able to describe to Charcot the ice conditions during the 1906-7 season. Commander Charcot also mentioned the hospitality of "Mme Andresen who accompanies him and is probably the first and only woman that has ever come to the Antarctic". It has also been claimed that this lady, from Magallanes but of Norwegian origin (Betsy Rasmussen), was the first woman to winter in the Antarctic from December 1908 to November 1909.

Some years afterwards, Andresen purchased the floating factory Sobr aon and 2 whale catchers and set off on a unique voyage intended to follow the whales on their outward migratory trek and back again. Starting at San Pedro, Chile, and sailing north along the coast of Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, during 14 months [ April 1914 to May 1915 ] he had covered at the end of the return trip some 8000 miles and had gathered a great deal of valuable infomation on stocks of whales in hitherto unknown grounds. His scientific and commercial cruise was a notable achievement, foreshadowing the arguments which many years after would be advanced to sustain the 200 mile EEZ doctrine.

The financial collapse in the autumn of 1920 broke Andresen, who was forced to realise all his assets. He managed to organise a new company designated as "Chilean-Norwegian Community" (Comunidad Chileno-Noruega) and fitted out an expedition consisting of a small floating factory and two whale catchers in 1933, but its operations were not successful. He died in poverty in Chile on 12 January 1940.

Few things remind us of Andresen's exploits. The Chilean Navy has preserved his tomb in Punta Arenas' cemetery. Andresen island near the Antarctic Peninsula, as well as Telefon Bay, Deception Island, named after a collier out of Hamburg wrecked at the entrance to Andmiralty Bay, King George Island, December 1908, and salvaged by Andresen, are probably the only important traces of this rich past. It seems appropriate to erect a cairn at Whaler's Bay, close to the remains of the old Norwegian station and to the historic whalers' Cemetery in order to adequately honour this man who was the fourth of the Antarctic whaling pioneers (Lassen, Christensen and Bogen being the other three), a citizen of Norway and Chile, but above all an early settler of the Antarctic region, which he knew and loved well.
