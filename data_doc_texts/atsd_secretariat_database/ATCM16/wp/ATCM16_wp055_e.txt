Recommendations of Working Group I    

(submitted by Working Group I)       
Draft Recommendation

Exchange of Information

(Agenda item 7)

The Representatives,

Recalling the provisions of Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that their Governments give effect in their domestic legislation to obligations 
arising from agreements reached at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings;

Noting that the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, the Convention on 
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty contain provisions whereby information about such 
domestic legislation is, or is to be, exchanged between Parties;

Noting, however, that such provision has not been made in relation to obligations 
arising from Recommendations adopted at Consultative Meetings;

Aware that knowledge of this domestic legislation can be of interest to the other 
Consultative Parties;

Recommend to their Governments that they include in their exchange of information 
under Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty, information on any domestic legislation enacted 
to give effect to obligations arising from Recommendations adopted at Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meetings.
Draft Recommendation on 
Accessibility of Antarctic Geophysical Data

The Representatives,

Recalling that Article 3 of the Antarctic Treaty requires that scientific data be ex-
changed and made freely available;

Noting that Article 7 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic 
Treaty signed in Madrid on 4 October, 1991 prohibits any activity relating to mineral 
resources other than scientific research;

Aware that solid earth science disciplines have made major contributions to the 
understanding of our planet, and that such work has long been recognized as having global 
significance as applied inter alia to studies of plate tectonics and Antarctic glacial history 
including its effects on world climate;

Reiterating the importance of pursuing geological and geophysical research and their 
commitment to the disclosure, availability and timely publication of scientific results;

Recommend to their governments that the Seismic Data Library System (SDLS) 
approved by the SCAR Executive in 1991 and described in the report "A SCAR Seismic 
Data Library System for Cooperative Research" of the SCAR Group of Specialists on the 
Evolution of Cenozoic Paleoenvironments of the Southern High Latitudes (GSC) - Antarctic 
Offshore Acoustic Stratigraphy Project (ANTOSTRAT) be implemented. The SDLS requires 
inter alia that digital data from multichannel seismic reflection surveys be sent to the SDLS 
within four years of collection and eight years after collection to the World Data Centers or 
other archives for general dissemination.

Draft Recommendation
on Tourism and Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area

The Representatives,

Bearing in mind that the XVth Consultative Meeting agreed that a comprehensive review of tourism and non-governmental activities was required;

Noting that the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and its Annexes apply to tourist and non-governmental activities in Antarctica;

Recalling that the XIIth Special Consultative Meeting asked the XVIth Consultative Meeting to address the issue of tourism and non-governmental activities;

Acknowledging that the Protocol constitutes the framework for further progress in Antarctic environmental protection;

Concerned about the possible effect of increased tourism and non-governmental activities in Antarctica;

Conscious of the need to ensure that the presence of tourists and other visitors in Antarctica be regulated so as to limit adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment;

Recommend to their Governments that:

1.    A meeting of the Parties be convened with a view to making proposals to the XVIIth Consultative Meeting on the question of a comprehensive regulation of tourist and non-governmental activities in Antarctica in accordance with the Protocol and taking into account the proposals made at the present XVIth Consultative Meeting, including proposals for a future Annex to the Protocol on Environmental Protection;

2.    Prior to the convening of that meeting and in order to ensure due preparation of its work, proposals should be prepared by them taking into account the list of issues stated below, which the meeting should, inter alia, primarily address:

      a) environmental issues
            - implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection and its Annexes
            - number of tourists / carrying capacity
- homologation of standards relating to vessels
- permanent infrastructure for tourists
- concentration / dispersal of tourist activities
- access to unexplored areas

b) operational issues
- notification and expansion of information to be exchanged
- system for granting permission to visit stations
- self-sufficiency
- insurance, including search and rescue insurance
- information obligation of Parties
- preparation and training of tour guides, and visitors' guides
- examination of the need for specific kinds of control and monitoring
- requirements for organisational procedures

3. The Meeting shall begin its work in Rome on 28 October 1992.

4. Representatives of the WTO, SCAR, IUCN, IAATO, IMO, ASOC, PATA and COMNAP be invited to attend the Meeting as observers.
