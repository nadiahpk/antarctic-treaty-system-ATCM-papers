Draft Recommendation

Extended Coverage of the Annual Report

(Agenda item 7)

The Representatives,

Recalling the provisions of Article III of the Antarctic Treaty;

Considering that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties adopt in their domestic legislation 
rules designed to regulate the many and varied activities conducted in Antarctica;

Conscious of the fact that, in many instances, this domestic legislation covers such subjects as 
protection of the Antarctic environment, harbour and airport charges for shipping and aircraft 
used for Antarctic operations on own account or for third parties, and customs, tax and 
immigration exemptions;

Considering that the entry into force of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and its Annexes 
will require the adoption of domestic legislation by the Consultative Parties;

Convinced that knowledge of this domestic legislation can be of interest to the other 
Consultative Parties;

Recommend to their Governments that:

They engage in the regular exchange of information on domestic legislation specifically 
relating to measures adopted by the Consultative Parties in connection with the Antarctic 
Treaty and other components of the Antarctic Treaty System which may be deemed to be of
interest to the other Consultative Parties, and they give details of the nature and number of 
the legal instrument, its date of promulgation and its purpose.
