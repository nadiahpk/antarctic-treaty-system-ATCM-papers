DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

Antarctic Protected Areas:
Consideration of CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP)
Sites as Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(Item 11)

(submitted by the United Kingdom)
Explanatory Note

1.  In an effort to assess the potential impact of marine resource harvesting on seal and 
seabird predators, the Working Group of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme 
(CEMP) has instigated monitoring studies at a number of terrestrial sites in the Antarctic.

2.  The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, at its 
meeting in Hobart, Australia, 22 October to 2 November 1990, concerned to provide 
protection for CEMP sites, and for the scientific investigations and marine living resources 
within them, adopted Conservation Measure 18/IX on 'Procedure for According Protection to 
CEMP Sites'.

3.  Conservation Measure 18/IX provides procedures for the adoption of Management 
Plans for CEMP sites, including: necessary consultations with the Scientific Committee on 
Antarctic Research (SCAR), with the Contracting Parties to other components of the 
Antarctic Treaty System which are in force, and with the Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Parties.

4.  SCAR, at its XXI meeting, Sao Paulo, Brazil (24-27 July 1990), recommended that to 
avoid conflict of research interests at terrestrial sites, consideration be given to nominating 
proposed CEMP sites as SSSIs under Recommendation VIII-3, with Management Plans to be 
drafted so as to meet the objectives of CCAMLR.
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREAS:
CONSIDERATION OF CCAMLR ECOSYSTEM
MONITORING PROGRAMME (CEMP) SITES
AS SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST

The Representatives,

Recalling Recommendations VII-3 and VIII-3;

Noting that the Contracting Parties to the Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources adopted at the
IXth meeting of the Commission in Hobart (22 October to 2 November
1990), in accordance with Article IX of the Convention,

Conservation Measure 18/IX 'Procedure for According Protection to
CEMP Sites' which provides for the adoption of Management Plans
for terrestrial monitoring sites, following consultation with the
Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR), with the
Contracting Parties to other components of the Antarctic Treaty
System and with the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties;

Noting also that not all Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties are
Contracting Parties to CCAMLR;

Noting further that the Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR) has recommended that conflicts of research
interests at terrestrial sites that are being used for CCAMlR
monitoring purposes, should be avoided;

Recommends to Geovernments that, in relation to terrestrial sites
which are the subject of Management Plans adopted by CCAMLR under
Conservation Measure 81/IX 'Procedures for According Protection to
CEMP Sites', they designate such sites as Sites of Special
Scientific Interest and voluntarily take account of such
Management Plans.
