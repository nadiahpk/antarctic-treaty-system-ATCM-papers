Draft Recommendation

Exchange of Information

(Agenda item 7)

The Representatives,

Recalling the provisions of Articles III and VII of the Antarctic Treaty;

Noting that their Governments give effect in their domestic legislation to obligations arising 
from agreements reached at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings;

Noting that the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, the Convention on the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty contain provisions whereby information about such 
domestic legislation is, or is to be, exchanged between Parties;

Noting, however, that such provision has not been made in relation to obligations arising from 
Recommendations adopted at Consultative Meetings;

Aware that knowledge of this domestic legislation can be of interest to the other Consultative 
Parties;

Recommend to their Governments that they include in their exchange of information under 
Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty any domestic legislation enacted to give effect to 
obligations arising from Recommendations adopted at Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
Meetings.
