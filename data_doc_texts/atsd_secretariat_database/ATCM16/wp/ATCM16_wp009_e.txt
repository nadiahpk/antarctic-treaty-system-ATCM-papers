Japanese Proposal on the Role of Antarctic Science in Understanding the 
                  Global Environment, Including Depletion of the Ozone Layer

Japanese Proposal on the Role of Antarctic Science in Understanding the Global 
Environment, Including Depletion of the Ozone Layer

The XVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting approved a declaration "Declaration on the 
ozone layer and climate change". In this declaration, all delegates expressed a strong support 
to the international efforts to eradicate the causes giving rise to the depletion of the ozone 
layer.

In this regard Japanese delegation draws the attention of all delegates to the scientific 
fact that a quite clear depletion of ozone layer has been occurring in the Antarctic and 
proposes that an appropriate action of this meeting should be taken to make an appeal in this 
regard to the governments of all parties of the Antarctic Treaty.

Mean total ozone amount observed at Syowa Station from 1 to 17 September was 213 
m atm-cm. This figure is one third of its monthly mean value of September between 1970 and 
1979 during which ozone depletion was not observed there. By the sounding of ozone profile 
it is showed that extreme depletion occurred in the layer between 15 and 20 km in altitude 
with the progress of season in Septmeber. According to the ozone bulletin issued by WMO, 
other Antarctic stations and the U.S. satellites also recorded the ozone depletion. There is 
well developed polar vortex over the Antarctic continent and air temperature in the 
stratosphere is so low that the stratospheric cloud which seems to play an important role in 
the chemical process of ozone destruction emerges. Accordingly the Japan Meteorological 
Agency advises the necessity of ozone monitoring till the time of stratospheric sudden warm.

The ozone depletion began to occur in the lat 1970's and generally emerged every 
other year. However it should be noted that the present depletion occurred following 1989 
and 1990.
