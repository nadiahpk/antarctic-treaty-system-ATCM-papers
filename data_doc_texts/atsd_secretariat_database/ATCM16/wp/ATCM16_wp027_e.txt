International Cooperation on Common Projects

(Item 13 (b))

(submitted by Italy)
International Co-operation on Common Projects

The knowledge of the Antarctic continent is still far to be complete.

Different research-projects, from different nations, located in different Antarctic Stations, usually are related to selected areas which either overlap one to the other, or are far away one from the other.

Organization of the research efforts in a systematic way is envisaged to optimize the results for a better understanding of the Antarctic site.

Therefore, the representatives

*recalling    the XV ATCM/WP/40 on the co-operation in the field of Cartography
*recalling    the XV ATCM/WP/46 on International Scientific Co-operation in the Antarctic
*recognising  the need to avoid duplication of data collections
*recognising  the need share data in a compatible way
*recognising  the need to optimize the research efforts to work efficiently
*desiring     to increase scientific co-operation in Antarctic, apart from any competition
*recommend   their Governments to do what is necessary,
through their national committees or through SCAR,

- to identify projects in selected research fields (e.g. cartography, geology,
meteorology), where close collaboration among the nations is envisaged

- to nominate project leaders to define competence areas, in order to ensure the
matching of data from different groups to give an 'overall situation' of the Antarctic
continent

- to facilitate data-exchange among participants to these common projects with suitable
network-connection

- to organize the archiving of data from different nations related to these common
research areas
