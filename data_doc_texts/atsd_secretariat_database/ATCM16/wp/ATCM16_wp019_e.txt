DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

Specially Protected Areas:
Revised Descriptions and Proposed Management Plans for SPAs
NOS 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19
(Item 11)

(submitted by the United Kingdom)
Explanatory Note

At ATCM XV (Paris 1989) Treaty Parties adopted Recommendations
XV-8 and XV-9, dealing with Specially Protected Areas. These
Recommendations respectively amend Article VIII(4) of the Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna and
call for a review of Specially Protected Areas.

Article XV-8 added a sub-paragraph (c) to Article VIII(4) of the
Agreed Measures. This states that a permit shall have effect
within a Specially Protected Area provided that 'the actions
permitted thereunder are in accordance with any Management Plan
accompanying the description of a Specially Protected Area'.

Article XV-9 recommends that Governments review the descriptions
of Specially Protected Areas and provide provisional Area
Management Plans for consideration by ATCMs.

Revised descriptions and proposed Management Plans for eight
SPAs (Nos 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19) were considered by
GOSEAC II, Sao Paulo, Brazil (9-13 July 1990) and approved by
SCAR at its XXI meeting (24-27 July) at the same venue.

Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 8

Dion Islands, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula

1. Geographical location

The Dion Islands (67°53'S, 68°42'W) are a small group of low-lying rocky islands lying about 13 km south of the southern end of Adelaide Island, in the north-western part of Marguerite Bay.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area comprises all of the Dion Islands archipelago, which lie within an area of about 12 km², together with the intervening sea. The islands and islets are small, rocky and often precipitous, notably Emperor Island which is also the highest (46 m altitude). The main islands are the largest of the Courtier Islands group (c. 8 ha), Emperor Island (c. 5 ha) and the largest of the Consort Islands group (c. 3 ha). Low lying areas occur on the two largest islands. There are a few small permanent ice patches, but there are no streams or permanent pools.

(ii) Reason for designation
The Area possesses the only known breeding population of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is situated on a low-lying beach and rocky headland in the south-eastern part of Emperor Island. It is also the most northerly and probably the smallest colony (annual numbers fluctuate between about 50 and 500 pairs), and is one of only two in which breeding occurs on land (see also SPA No.1). It is also the most isolated emperor colony, being about 2,500 km (by sea) from the nearest known rookery. Other breeding birds within the Area include a small colony of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) near the emperor penguin colony, and about 200 pairs of blue-eyed shags (Phalacrocorax atriceps) on the precipitous north side of the same island.

(iii) Date of designation and originator
November 1966, Recommendation IV-8, by U.K.

(iv) Access points
None specified, but access should be from the sea; landing on Emperor Island should be at least 100 m from the emperor penguin colony or any non-breeding aggregations of these birds.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere, or for site inspection, and which will not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII). Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

(a) land a helicopter within the Area;

(b) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point;
(c) use any of the Area's coves, bays or intervening water for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in accordance with the permit;

(d) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; 
all such waste must be removed from the Area;

(f) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are further required within the same season, at the end of which they must be removed;

(g) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding bird or seal, particularly emperor penguins which pedestrians should not approach closer than 50 m, unless required as specified in the permit.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance
Inspection visits to the Area should be made at least once every five years to assess the state of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes. Other visits should be made as necessary to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 9

Green Island, Berthelot Islands, Antarctic Peninsula

1. Geographical location

Green Island (65°19'S, 64°10'W) is a small island on the north side of the Berthelot Islands group, lying between the north-west side of Collins Bay and Grandidier Channel, about 3 km off the Graham Coast of the mid-west Antarctic Peninsula.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area comprises all of Green Island, a small rocky island lying about 0.25 km to the north of the largest of the Berthelot Islands. It is about 500 m from north to south and 300 m from east to west, rising to a dome-shaped peak at about 80 m altitude. The island rises steeply on all sides, with high precipitous cliffs on the south and east sides. Along the north side is a gently sloping rock platform. There are several permanent snow patches with the largest occurring to the south and east of the summit. There are no streams or pools.

(ii) Reason for designation
Green Island is extensively vegetated on the north facing slopes and has especially well-developed continuous banks of moss turf formed by Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Polytrichum alpestre which, over much of their extent, overlie peat of more than 1 m in depth. Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) is frequent in small patches near the shag colony. The island has two important bird colonies. A large blue-eyed shag (Phalacrocorax atriceps) colony with about 250 nests occurs on the steep, rocky north-west corner; this is one of the largest shag colonies on the Antarctic Peninsula. There are also large numbers of brown skuas (Catharacta lonnbergii) and a few south polar skuas (C. maccormicki) and hybrids, but only a few of the former are known to breed.

(iii) Date of designation and originator
November 1966, Recommendation IV-9, by U.K.

(iv) Access points
None specified, but landings by boat or helicopter are easiest on the north side of the island.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere, or for site inspection, and which will not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII). Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

    (a) land a helicopter within the Area, except on the rock platform near sea level on the north side of the island;

    (b) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point;

    (c) use any of the Area's coves for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in accordance with the permit;
(d) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area;
all such waste must be removed from the Area;

(e) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are further required within the same season, at the end of which they must
removed;

(f) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to cause minimal damage to the luxurient moss banks and avoid disturbance of any breeding bird or seal, unless required as specified in the permit.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance
Inspection visits to the Area should be at least once every five years to assess the state of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes. Other visits should be made as necessary to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 13

Moe Island, South Orkney Islands

1. Geographical location

Moe Island (60°45'S, 45°41'W) is a small island lying about 0.5 km off the south-west extremity of Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, from which it is separated by Fyr Channel.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area is an irregularly shaped island about 1.8 km from north-east to south-west, and 1 km from north-west to south-east. It rises precipitously on the north-eastern and south-eastern sides to Snipe Peak (226 m altitude); there is a subsidiary summit above South Point (102 m altitude) and lower hills on each of three promontories on the western side above Corral Point (92 m), Conroy Point (89 m) and Spaull Point (56 m). Small areas of permanent ice remain on the east and south facing slopes, with late lying snow patches on the steeply dipping western slopes. There are no streams or pools.

(ii) Reason for designation
Moe Island provides an excellent representative sample of the maritime Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem, with particularly well-developed stands of vegetation typical of the South Orkney Islands. The dominant plant communities are Andreaea-Usnea fellfield and banks of Chorisodontium-Polytrichum moss turf (the main stand of which is continuous over 5 ha, including large areas of eroded peat, and represents the largest known example of this community type in the Antarctic). The cryptogamic flora and arthropod fauna are diverse. There are five colonies of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) totalling about 11,000 pairs. Numerous other birds breed on the island, notably about 2,000 pairs of cape petrels (Daption capensis) and large numbers of Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata). Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are sometimes frequent in the bays on the west side of the island. An increasing number of immature bull fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) come ashore on the north side of Landing Cove and are causing some damage to vegetation. However, the nature of the terrain should restrict the animals to this small headland.

Because of the long-established intensive experimental field research and the very extensive destruction of the lowland terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems caused by fur seals on neighbouring Signy Island, Moe Island serves as an important control site with which future comparisons may be made with particular regard to biological and environmental change in the region.

(iii) Date of designation and originator
November 1966, Recommendation IV-13, by U.K.

(iv) Access points
None specified, but preferably and most safely, from the sea at the north-east corner of Landing Cove.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere or for site inspection, and which will not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII).
Details of the visit should be included in the. national annual report of Exchange of 
Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions 
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

(a) land a helicopter within the Area, except on the col between hill 89 m and the 
western slope of Snipe Peak, to the south of Landing Cove;

(b) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point, except for 
access to the landing area specified in (a), which should be directly from the 
cove to the north or south avoiding any seabird colonies;

(c) use any of the Area's coves or bays for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in 
accordance with the permit;

(d) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; 
all such waste must be removed from the Area;

(e) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are 
further required within the same season, at the end of which they must be 
removed;

(f) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes 
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding 
bird or seal or stand of vegetation, unless required as specified in the permit; in particular, 
stands of Polytrichum-Chorisodontium moss banks and areas of eroding peat should be 
avoided wherever possible.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling 
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance 
Inspection visits to the Area should be made once every year to assess the state of the site 
and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes, particularly with regard 
to increasing damage caused by fur seals to the island's vegetation. Such visits should also 
be used to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 14

Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands

1. Geographical location

Lynch Island (60°40'S, 45°38'W) is a small island situated at the east end of Marshall Bay,
in the mid south coast of Coronation Island and directly to the north of Signy Island, South
Orkney Islands.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area is a small rocky island, c. 200 m from the south coast of Coronation Island, and
about 500 m from east to west and 300 m from north to south, rising to a flat plateau with a
maximum altitude of 33 m. On the south, east and west sides there are low cliffs up to 20
m high, and boulder-filled gulleys, while the northern side has a low cliff below a rock
terrace at about 5-8 m altitude. There are no streams or pools, and only a few small late-
lying snow patches occur on the southern side of the island.

(ii) Reason for designation
Lynch Island supports one of the most extensive and dense stands of Antarctic hair grass
(Deschampsia antarctica) known in the Treaty Area. The only other Antarctic flowering
plant, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), is also abundant. The cryptogamic
vegetation is typical of the region, but several species of moss are unusually fertile here
(notably Polytrichum alpinum and Muelleriella crassifolia). Beneath the grass swards on
the moist north-facing slope a shallow loam-like earth resembling tundra brown soil has
developed and contains a rich invertebrate fauna. Moist moss in rock crevices on the north
side of the island harbours a rare terrestrial enchytraeid worm. Breeding birds are poorly
represented, but most species of Antarctic seals are common around the island and
occasionally ashore (particularly an increasing number of immature bull fur seals,
Arctocephalus gazella, which come ashore in summer).

(iii) Date of designation and originator
November 1966, Recommendation IV-14, by U.K.

(iv) Access points
Access should be from the sea, landing at a prominent low rocky promontory or the
adjacent cove to the west, on the north side of the island.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the
Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling
scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere or for site inspection, and which will
not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic
Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII).
Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of
Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

    (a) drive any vehicle within the Area;
    (b) land a helicopter within the Area;
    (c) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point;
(d) use any of the Area's coves or bays for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in accordance with the permit;

(e) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; all such waste must be removed from the Area;

(f) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are further required within the same season, at the end of which they must be removed;

(g) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes

None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding bird or seal or stand of vegetation, unless required as specified in the permit; in particular, areas of Deschampsia and Colobanthus should be avoided wherever possible.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling

All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance

Inspection visits to the Area should be made at least once every year to assess the state of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes, particularly with regard to increasing damage caused by fur seals to the island's grass-dominated communities. Such visits should also be used to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 15

Southern Powell Island and adjacent islands, South Orkney Islands

1. Geographical location

Powell Island (60°45'S, 45°02'W) is the third largest of the South Orkney Islands, lying 
between Coronation Island to the west and Laurie Island to the east.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area

The Area includes all of Powell Island south of the latitude of the southern summit of John 
Peaks (375 m altitude), together with Michelsen Island (a peninsula rising to 38 m altitude 
and separated from a long promontory at the south end of Powell Island by a low isthmus 
which floods at high tide) and adjacent unnamed rocky islets, Christoffersen Island (96 m 
altitude) to the west, Grey Island (43 m altitude) to the south, and Fredriksen Island (about 
300 m altitude) to the east. All but southern Powell Island (Crutchley Ice Piedmont) are 
mainly ice-free in summer. All intervening sea is included within the Area.

(ii) Reason for designation

The Area is of exceptional biological interest, supporting limited stands of vegetation 
typical of biotically influenced coastal habitats of the region, and considerable populations 
of a diversity of bird and seal species. The bryophyte vegetation is best developed at the 
extreme north-west corner of the Area on south-west Powell Island, on Christoffersen 
Island and locally on northern Fredriksen Island; elsewhere there are extensive nitrophilous 
lichen communities on the rocks and cliffs. There are several biotically contaminated melt 
pools and streams, especially on the beach on the east side of southern Powell Island where 
Crutchley Ice Piedmont is receding.

Large numbers of penguins and petrels breed throughout the Area. There are about 50,000 
breeding pairs of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) of which about 80% occur on 
Fredriksen Island, and about the same number of Adélie penguins (P. adeliae) of which 
almost all occur in the southern Powell-Michelsen Island area. There are about 3,000 pairs 
of gentoo penguins (P. papua) breeding on the southern promontory of Powell Island, 
Michelsen Island and Christoffersen Island. There are also a few pairs of macaroni 
penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus). Other breeding birds include southern giant petrels 
(Macronectes giganteus), cape petrels (Daption capensis), snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea), 
Wilson's storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), blue-eyed shags (Phalacrocorax atriceps), 
Dominican gulls (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic terns (Sterna vittata), brown skuas 
(Catharacta lonnbergii), sheathbills (Chionis alba), and possibly Antarctic prions 
(Pachyptila desolata) and black bellied storm petrels (Fregetta tropica). The isthmus 
between southern Powell Island and Michelsen Island is the longest-known breeding site in 
the Antarctic for fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) in the South Orkney Islands since their 
extermination in the nineteenth century. However, the small number of pups born annually 
has not increased substantially; a few pups are also born on suitable beaches on Fredriksen 
Island. Other seals are frequent on the beaches, e.g. elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), 
Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx), and 
crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) are occasionally seen on ice floes within the Area.

(iii) Date of designation and originator

November 1966, Recommendation IV-15, by U.K.

(iv) Access points

None specified, but access should preferably be from the sea.
(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere or for site inspection, and which will not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII). Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

    (a) drive any vehicle within the Area;
    (b) land a helicopter within the Area, except on the north-eastern part of the beach on the east side of the promontory of southern Powell Island providing there are no aggregations of wildlife, or on unvegetated areas in the north of Fredriksen Island, both to be at least 0.5 km from any bird or seal colonies or aggregations;

    (c) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point;
    (d) use any of the Area's coves or bays for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in accordance with the permit; ships may anchor only in the strait between Michelsen and Fredriksen Islands;

    (e) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; all such waste must be removed from the Area;

    (f) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are further required within the same season, at the end of which they must be removed;

    (g) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding bird (especially giant petrels, which pedestrians should not approach closer than 100 m) or seal or stand of vegetation, unless required as specified in the permit.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance
Inspection visits to the Area should be made at least once every five years to assess the state of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes. Other visits should be made as necessary to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 16

Coppermine Peninsula, Robert Island, South Shetland Islands

1. Geographical location

Coppermine Peninsula (62°23'S, 59°42'W) is situated on the west side of Robert Island,
which lies between Nelson Island to the east and Greenwich Island to the west, midway
along the South Shetland Islands archipelago.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area comprises all land west of a north-south line across the isthmus between Carlota
Cove and Coppermine Cove, 100 m west of a small group of Chilean refuge huts. The
peninsula is about 1.7 km from south-east to north-west and up to 0.6 km from north-east
to south-west, and is largely surrounded by precipitous cliffs. There are three prominent
low hills which reach a highest point at about 220 m. The easternmost lies close to the
isthmus; there is a central hill composed of basaltic columns referred to as "Neptune's
Cathedral", and the westernmost is situated above Fort William at the extreme west of the
peninsula. The isthmus (mainly outside the Area) is a 250 m wide raised beach reaching
about 10 m altitude. Much of the higher ground is permanently ice covered. There are
numerous small streams and pools in summer.

(ii) Reason for designation
Coppermine Peninsula is a biologically rich area with a diverse biota typical of the South
Shetland Islands. It supports a wide range of plant communities with associated
invertebrate fauna; the vertebrate fauna is also particularly well represented. The
outstanding feature of the vegetation is a 1.5 ha closed carpet of the mosses Calliergidium
austro-stramineum, Calliergon sarmentosum and Drepanocladus uncinatus, representing
one of the largest continuous moss stands in the Antarctic. It overlies a thick layer of wet
moss peat. Large stands of the foliose cyanobacterium Nostoc commune occur on moist
slopes and in depressions. A large number of bryophyte and lichen species occur within
the Area, and Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) is frequent. A small colony of
chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) occurs at Fort William. There are about 30 small
colonies of southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus). Other breeding species include
about 2,000 nests of Wilson's storm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) in at least 13 colonies,
up to 1,000 Antarctic terns (Sterna vittata) in nine colonies, 300-400 Dominican gulls
(Larus dominicanus) in ten colonies, and numerous brown skuas (Catharacta lonnbergii).
Seals are common around the peninsula and frequently haul out at the isthmus, notably
elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and
increasingly large numbers of fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella).

(iii) Date of designation and proposer nation
November, 1966, Recommendation IV-10, by Chile.

(iv) Access points
Access should be from the isthmus outside the Area by sea from Coppermine Cove or
Carlota Cove, or by helicopter also to the east of the Area.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry to the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the
Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling
scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere or for site inspection, and which will
not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic
Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII).
Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

    (a) drive any vehicle within the Area;
    (b) land a helicopter within the Area;
    (c) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point;
    (d) use any of the Area's coves or bays for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in accordance with the permit;

    (e) Incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; all such waste must be removed from the Area;
    (f) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are required within the same season, at the end of which they must be removed;
    (g) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding bird (especially giant petrels, which pedestrians should not approach closer than 100 m) or seal or stand of vegetation (especially the extensive carpet of moss on the isthmus), unless required as specified in the permit.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance
Inspection visits to the Area should be made at least once every three years to assess the state of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes. Other visits should be made as necessary to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 18

North Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands

1. Geographical location

Coronation Island (60°38'S, 45°35'W) is the largest of the South Orkney Islands, situated 
at the west end of the archipelago.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
The Area lies on the central north side of Coronation Island. It is bounded to the east by 
Foul Point (60°32'S, 45°29'W) and to the west by Conception Point (60°31'S, 45°41'W); 
the entire area of these points, together with the intervening sea, is included in the site. The 
eastern boundary follows a precipitous ridge 6 km southward to a position at 2,500 ft (c. 
750 m) altitude immediately to the west of Mount Nivea summit (60°35'S, 45°29'W), 
thence west-south-westward for 5.5 km to a position at 3,000 ft (c. 900 m) altitude to the 
north-east of Wave Peak summit (60°37'S, 45°36'W), and from there 4 km westward 
across the Brisbane Heights plateau, then 4 km north-north-west to an unnamed summit at 
3,532 ft (c.1,060 m) and north for 6 km to Conception Point. The summits of Mount 
Nivea and Wave Peak and the col known as High Stile are outside the Area. Ommanney 
Bay and the unnamed bay to the west are included within the Area, south of the boundary 
between Conception and Foul points (11.5 km).

(ii) Reason for designation
The Area embraces areas of coastal ice-free terrain (Conception, Prong and Foul Points) 
with large seabird colonies and lichen-dominated cliffs, and permanent icefields (two major 
glaciers and ice cliffs rising to the Brisbane Heights plateau) which provide an excellent 
representative area of a pristine ice environment near the northern limit of the maritime 
Antarctic and Antarctic Treaty Area. The inter-related terrestrial, ice and marine 
components of the Area comprise an integrated example of the coastal permanent ice and 
sublittoral ecosystems typical of the maritime Antarctic environment.

(iii) Date of designation and originator
October 1985, Recommendation XIII-10, by UK.

(iv) Access points
None specified.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the Area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the 
Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling 
scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere or for site inspection, and which will 
not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic 
Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII). 
Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of 
Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

(a) drive any vehicle within the Area;

(b) land a helicopter within 0.5 km of any bird or seal colonies or aggregations, or 
    on any of the icefields;
(c) overfly Conception, Prong or Foul Points below 250 m above their respective highest points;

(d) use any of the Area's coves or bays for anchoring or mooring seacraft, except in accordance with the permit; ships must not enter the Area;

(e) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; all such waste, including human waste in all ice-covered areas, must be removed from the Area;

(f) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they are further required within the same season, at the end of which they must be removed;

(g) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding bird or seal.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance
Inspection visits to the Area should be made no more than once every five years to assess the state of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes.
Other visits should be made as necessary to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
Proposed Management Plan for Specially Protected Area No. 20

Lagotellerie Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula

1. Geographical location

Lagotellerie Island (67°53'S, 67°24'W) lies about 3 km west of the southern part of 
Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay, south-west Antarctic Peninsula.

2. Management Plan

(i) Description of Area
Lagotellerie Island is about 2 km from east to west by about 1 km from north to south, and 
rises steeply to twin summits of c. 270 and 290 m altitude separated by a broad saddle. 
The north side of the island is largely snow-free with extensive low-lying ground. The 
south and east sides have precipitous cliffs up to 180 m high; much of the north side also 
has steep cliffs dissected by gulleys and traversed by broad rock terraces. There are no 
permanent streams or pools.

(ii) Reason for designation
The island has a relatively diverse flora and luxuriant development of plant communities, 
representative of the southern maritime Antarctic region. The north side supports an 
abundance of Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) which on some of the terraces 
forms closed swards up to 10 m2. Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) is also 
frequent. Both species are close to the southern limit of their range. There is also a rich 
cryptogamic flora with well-developed communities containing several rare mosses and 
lichens. Beneath the closed grass and moss stands a rich loamy earth up to 25 cm deep has 
developed, with a rich invertebrate fauna and microbiota. The island is one of the 
southernmost sites for the apterous midge Belgica antarctica. There is a colony of about 
1,000 pairs of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at the south-east corner of the island. 
Here, there is also a small colony of about 30 pairs of blue-eyed shags (Phalacrocorax 
atriceps), which is one of the farthest south breeding sites for the species. Brown and 
south polar skuas (Catharacta lonnbergii and C. maccormicki) are abundant and several 
pairs of each nest on this island.

(iii) Date of designation and proposer nation
October 1985, Recommendation XIII-11, by U.K.

(iv) Access points
None specified.

(v) Entry permit requirement
Entry into the area is only in strict accordance with a current permit, issued by the 
Participating Government or its authorized representative, specifically for a compelling 
scientific purpose which cannot be served elsewhere or for site inspection, and which will 
not jeopardize any aspect of the natural ecosystem or its biota within the Area (see Antarctic 
Treaty Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII).
Details of the visit should be included in the national annual report of Exchange of 
Information for the same Antarctic season in which the activities were carried out.

(vi) Prohibitions
To avoid or minimize human impact it is prohibited to:

    (a) land a helicopter within the Area, except on the low-lying unvegetated ground in 
        the mid north side of the island and on the saddle between the two peaks;

    (b) overfly the Area by any aircraft below 250 m above the highest point;
(c) use any of the Area's coves for anchoring or mooring seacraft except in 
accordance with the permit;

(d) incinerate, bury or otherwise dispose of any non-human waste within the Area; 
all such waste must be removed from the Area;

(e) leave depots of fuel, food, or any other supplies within the Area, unless they 
are further required within the same season, at the end of which they must be 
removed;

(f) erect any form of building within the Area.

(vii) Pedestrian routes 
None specified, but every precaution must be taken to avoid disturbance of any breeding 
bird or seal or stand on vegetation, unless required as specified in the permit.

(viii) Scientific research and sampling 
All activities must conform strictly with those specified in the permit to enter the Area.

(ix) Inspection and maintenance 
Inspection visits to the Area should be made at least once every five years to assess the state 
of the site and to monitor any significant biological or environmental changes. Other visits 
should be made as necessary to maintain boundary markers, notices, etc.
