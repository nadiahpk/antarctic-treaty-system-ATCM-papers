An Antarctic International Computer Network for Data Exchange

(Item 13 b)

(submitted by Italy)
An Antarctic International Computer Network
for Data Exchange

Many countries operate in Antarctica for short periods (nominally the Antarctic 
Summer) and research has to be carefully planned to optimize the ratio between results and 
time.

Data transmission to and from national research centers (via computer network) is 
necessary to provide informations for an 'in-loco' improvement of research-goals and 
research-planning.

Moreover, sharing of newly acquired results among the different research groups in 
Antarctica is desirable envisaged as part of the widely recalled international co-operation.

Therefore, the representatives

*recalling the XVth ATCM/WP/29 on the comparability and accessibility of Antarctic 
Scientific Data, where the creation of an Antarctic Scientific Data-Base 
is envisaged.

*recalling the XV ATCM/INF/41 on activities of the WMO in the field of Antarctic 
Meteorology and Telecommunications

*recognizing the need of access to past and related data from research-groups 
operating in Antarctica

*recognizing the impossibility to provide in-loco all the data needed to work efficiently

*desiring to increase the 'in-loco' scientific co-operation among different nations, even 
if located in different stations

*recommend their Governments to:
1) reserve a set of lines on international TC-satellite for Antarctic Scientific Stations
2) share the time on these lines among different countries present in Antarctica
3) dedicate the use of these lines to

a -	communications among different research stations for data and information 
    	exchange, via a computer network
b -	data exchange from and to a Main Antarctic Center in one's own country
