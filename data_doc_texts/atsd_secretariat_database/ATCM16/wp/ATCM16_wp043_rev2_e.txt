Exchange of Information

(Agenda item 7)

The Representatives,

Recalling the provisions of Article III of the Antarctic Treaty;

Considering that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties adopt in their domestic legislation rules designed to regulate their activities in Antarctica;

Conscious of the fact that, in many instances, this domestic legislation covers such subjects as protection of the Antarctic environment, harbour and airport charges for shipping and aircraft used for Antarctic operations on own account or for third parties, and customs, tax and immigration exemptions;

Acknowledging that the entry into force of the Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and its Annexes will require the adoption of domestic legislation by the Consultative Parties;

Aware that knowledge of this domestic legislation can be of interest to the other Consultative Parties;

Recommend to their Governments that:

They keep each other informed of domestic legislation that is in force specifically relating to measures adopted by the Consultative Parties in connection with the Antarctic Treaty and other components of the Antarctic Treaty System which may be deemed to be of interest to the other Consultative Parties, and they give details as appropriate of the nature, name and number of the legal instrument, its date of promulgation and its purpose.
