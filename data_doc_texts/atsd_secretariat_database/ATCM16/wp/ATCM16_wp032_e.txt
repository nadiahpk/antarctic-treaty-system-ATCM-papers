Exchange of Information
(Item 7 (d))

(submitted by Germany)
Exchange of Information
Item 7 (d)

In order to promote the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty, particularly the international co-operation in scientific investigation and the observance of the fundamental provisions of the Treaty, Articles III and VII (5) provide for a regular exchange of information.

Recommendation VIII-6, modified by Recommendation XIII-3, summarizes the requirements and procedures for the exchange of information.

As experience of both government agencies as well as of research institutes has shown the exchange procedure as it stands is not always adequate.

In order to correspond to the actual development in this field the German delegation proposes the following modifications of the Annex to Recommendation VIII-6:

-   Transportation facilities, mentioned both under subparagraph I and VIII of Paragraph 3 should only be reported once.

-   The scientific programmes mentioned under subparagraph VII of paragraph 3 should be summarized in general terms.
    Detailed programmes are communicated through SCAR channels.

-   Information which is not necessary in the diplomatic exchange could be deleted, namely

    a)  detailed enumeration of participants of expeditions

    b)  detailed enumeration of small size equipment

    c)  detailed enumeration of the exact time of Antarctic activities. For meteorological reasons in many cases these activities cannot be carried out on schedule as a consequence of meteorological reasons.

    d)  detailed enumeration of modifications of the previous year.

The transmission of the information in advance by the way of telefax would furthermore accelerate the process considerably.
