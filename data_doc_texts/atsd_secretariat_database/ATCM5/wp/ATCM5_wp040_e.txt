PELAGIC SEALING
DRAFT RECOMMENDATION
(Tabled by the United Kingdom Delegation)

The Representatives :

Having considered Rec. IV-21 (Interim Guide Lines for
the Voluntary Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing) in the
light of the reports of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR);

Recognising the need for an international agreement for the
effective regulation nf Antarctic Pelagic Sealing :

Recommend to their Governements that :

1.  They study the Draft Convention (1) appended to this
Recommendation before the next Consultative Meeting
with a view to the completion and adoption in accordance
with the most appropriate procedure of a Convention for
the Regulation of Antarctic Pelagic Sealing ; and

2.  They follow the Principles stated in the Draft
Convention as voluntary Guide-Lines in the interim
period, to the greatest extent feasible.

(1) Note : This Draft Convention could be based on ANT 26 as modified
in the light of discussions held on a preliminary basis
without commitment, during the Fifth Consultative Meeting.
