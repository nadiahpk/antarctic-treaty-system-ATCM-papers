NOTE PRESENTED BY THE FRENCH DELEGATION ON THE:

CONVENED MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE FAUNA
AND THE FLORA IN ANTARTICA

The Fourth Consultative Meeting adopted various
important recommendations that constitute a first step
towards the practical application of convened measures
for the protection of the Flora and the Fauna.

Such are, notably, the recommendations:

- IV 1 to 15 defining a certain number of regions,
specially protected, that are to be included in the
annex B of the convened measures.

- IV 16 and 17 recommending on S.C.A.R.'s proposal, the
insertion in the Annex A of the aforesaid measures,
of the species of genus Arctocephalus and
Ommatophoca.

- IV 18 and 19 relative to cooperative measures that are
capable of limiting the attributions of delivery of
capture licenses.

- IV 20 requesting all Contracting Parties to consider,
within possible limits, the recommendations IV 1 to
19 as the line of conduct during the intermediate
period which will last until their definite entry
into force.

It has appeared necessary to the French Delegation,
in order to avoid these Measures remaining as a pure litera-
ture, to institute according to the article 9 of the Treaty,
an exchange of viewpoints in order to inform Contracting
Parties on their efficiency or eventual difficulties
encountred in their application.
