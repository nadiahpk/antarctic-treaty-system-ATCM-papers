Note presented by the French Delegation on

THE PELAGIC SEALING

The object of the Recommendation IV 31 may be defined as a desire to promote and apply in practice the objectives of protection, scientific studies and rational exploitation of seals.

This implies carrying into effect all dispositions tending to avoid the rupture of the ecological system of one particular spot through exaggerated annihilation on that spot.

The most precise evaluation as possible of the importance of stocking of concerned species as well as of their dispersion will precede the application of efficient protection measures.

The need of this study, which was began by it's members, have been underlined in the Recommendation IX 39 of the Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research (S.C.A.R.) and it will be desirable to request all governments to give all their aid to this project.
