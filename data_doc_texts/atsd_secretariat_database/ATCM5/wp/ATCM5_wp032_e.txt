NEW ZEALAND PROPOSAL REGARDING HISTORIC VESTIGES

New Zealand considers that the implementation of Recommendation I-IX would be facilitated if this Consultative Meeting prepared a definitive list of "tombs, buildings and objects of historic interest" which could be added to or amended from time to time at subsequent Consultative Meetings or through diplomatic channels. Such a list could, in effect, form an annex to Recommendation I-IX.

As far as the Ross Dependency is concerned the New Zealand delegation suggests that the following should be included in such a list :

1. C.E. Borchgrevink's hut which was built at Cape Adare in 1899. (lat. 71° 17'S, long. 170°15'E)

2. Captain R.F. Scott's hut which was built at Hut Point, Ross Island in 1902.(lat. 77°51'S, long. 166°37'E)

3. Sir E. Shackleton's hut which was built at Cape Royds, Ross Island in 1908? (lat.77°33'S, long. 166°07'E)

4. Captain R.F. Scott's hut which was built at Cape Evans, Ross Island in 1911. (lat.77°38'S, long.166°24'E)
- 2 -

5. Grave of Nicolai Hanson who died at Cape Adare in 1899.
(lat.71°17'S, long; 170°15'E)

6. Memorial cross to T. Vince which was erected at Hut Point,
Ross Island in 1903. (lat.77°51'S, long. 166°37'E)

7. Memorial cross to Captain R.F. Scott's Pole Party which was
erected on the top of Observation Hill, Ross Island in 1912.
(lat. 71°51'S, long. 166°40'E)

8. Memorial cross to three men of Sir E. Shackleton's 1914-16
Expedition erected at Cape Evans, Ross Island in 1916.
(lat. 77°38'S, 166°24'E)

New Zealand would also like to have included the hut
erected by Campbell's party (British Antarctic Expedition,
1910-13) at Cape Adare in 1911 and also the igloo occupied by
Campbell's Northern Party on Inexpressible Island (Terra Nova
Bay) but do not know whether their preserved condition warrants
preservation. We would therefore suggest that they be excluded
until they have been revisited.
