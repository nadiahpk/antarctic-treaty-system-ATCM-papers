DRAFT RECOMENDATION
SOUTHERN OCEAN

(Proposal made by the Delegation of the U.S.A.)

Recalling that Resolution 5 of the Vth Session of the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission established
a Coordination Group for the Southern Ocean;

Noting that the terms of reference for this group
included plans for the gradual development of a compre-
hensive study of the Southern Ocean ;

Noting further that the Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR) is invited to participate in the
Coordination Group as an observer ;

Considering that the seas of the Antarctic Treaty Area
are not only an important part of the Southern Ocean
but an integral part of the Antarctic environment and
that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have
already expended substantial effort in the exploration
of the Southern Ocean ;

Recognising the significant contribution which SCAR has
made to these scientific studies ;

The Representatives RECOMMEND to their governments that
they encourage SCAR to continue its interest in scientific
matters related to the Southern Ocean. Representatives
further RECOMMEND to their governments that they encourage
SCAR to make available scientific advice as appropriate
to the IOC Coordinating Group on the Southern Ocean to aid
in its development of plans for a comprehensive study of
the Southern Ocean.
