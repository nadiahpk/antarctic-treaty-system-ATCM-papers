NOTE PRESENTED BY THE FRENCH DELEGATION

"EMISSION OF A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAL STAMP"

The French Delegation is favorable to the emission of a
commemorative postal stamp  dedicated to the Antarctic Treaty.
However, this emission should be accepted and agreed upon by all
other signatories of the Treaty.

The French Delegation proposes that this  emission take place in
1971, the tenth anniversary of coming into force of the Treaty.  It is
felt that 1971 is more propicious than 1969, the year that commemorates
the signature of the Treaty, because of the following technical and
philatelic reasons : a) 1969's budget has already been prepared; and
b) the year 1968 already saw the issue of postal stamp dedicated to
polar expeditions.

The French Delegation hopes that each country concerned will
have its entire liberty in choosing the subject.  However, it will not
oppose if the theme will be decided by the Fifth Consultative Meeting.
