Explanatory note presented by the French Delegation on:

THE COORDINATION OF THE GENERAL MEETINGS OF THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE OF ANTARCTIC RESEARCH
(S.C.A.R.) AND THE CONSULTATIVE
MEETINGS OF THE TREATY.

The inconveniences that result from the absence of
coordination between the activities of the Consultative
Meetings and those of the Scientific Committee of Antarctic
Research (S.C.A.R.) have been denounced on many occassions
and are actively deplored by all those who are responsible
for antarctic programs.

Limiting oneself to recent events, it may be shown
that the general meeting of the S.C.A.R. was held from 30
to the 24th September 1966, in Santiago de Chile, whilst
the IV-th Consultative Meeting was opened in the same city
on November the 3rd of the same year. As a result, the
Consultative Meeting could not, within the prescribed time,
dispose of the recommendations that the S.C.A.R. has adop-
ted a month earlier.

Furthermore, it was seen last June in Tokyo, the
Treaty experts meeting double the work of logistics group
of the S.C.A.R., when both were attended by the same experts
resulting in confusion and supplementary expenses which
could have been avoided.

Another major inconvenience stems from the absence
of well defined procedures by which these two organisms
could inform each other of their common problems.

The Secretary General of the S.C.A.R. in order to 
palliate these difficultics, have sent a circular to all 
national committees requesting their intervention with 
their governments, and to obtain:

- that the consultative meetings and the general meetings 
of the S.C.A.R. alternate from one year to another.

- the definition of procedures that would permit to trans-
mit to the governments signatories of the Treaty, the 
documents prepared by the S.C.A.R.

The idea of alternating the meetings has an objec-
tive to permit each respective organism to utilize the 
works of the other within the time that is compatible with 
their exploitation. Consequently, it becomes necessary to 
define a way of transmission that would permit them to 
study the documents that would be submitted reciprocally 
for their study or action.

The most simple procedure would consist, basing 
on the Recommendation I - 4, of entrusting the National 
Committees of the S.C.A.R. with the task of informing 
their governmental authorities on the recommendations that 
the S.C.A.R. will judge as timely to be submitted and, 
inversely to transmit to the Secretary General of the 
S.C.A.R. the questions that the governments will judge 
necessary to submit to this organisation.

As national committees work in close contact with 
organizations of the state that are entrusted with the 
realizations of these programmes, this procedure should 
not raise any difficulty and will conserve the highest 
degree of elasticity.
