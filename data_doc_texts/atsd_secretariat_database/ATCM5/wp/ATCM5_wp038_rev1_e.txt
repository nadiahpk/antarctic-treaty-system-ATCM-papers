DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

SOUTHERN OCEAN

(Proposed by the United States)

The Representatives,

Considering that the Southern Ocean is an integral part of
the Antarctic environment and that the Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Governments have made substantial contributions
towards knowledge of this ocean ;

Noting that Resolution 5 of the Vth Session of the Inter-
governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) established a
Coordination Group for the Southern Ocean and that the terms
of reference for this group include plans for the gradual
development of a comprehensive study of the Southern Ocean;

Noting further the significant contribution the Scientific
Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) has made to these
studies and that SCAR is invited to participate in the Co-
ordination Group as an observer ;

Recommend to their Governments that they encourage  SCAR
to continue its interest in scientific matters related to the
Southern Ocean and to make available scientific advice as
appropriate to the IOC Coordination Group to aid in its
development of plans for the comprehensive study of the
Southern Ocean.
