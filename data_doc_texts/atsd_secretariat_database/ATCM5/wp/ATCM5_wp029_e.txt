PROPOSAL MADE BY THE SOVIET DELEGATION
TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND METEOROLOGY
WORKING PARTY MEETING held on 19th November 1968.

DRAFT RECOMMENDATION SUBMITTED
BY U.S.S.R.

Conscious of the necessity for regulating the system for
collecting and distributing aerosynoptic information, including
that concerning shipping, and for improving the meteorological
services provided to personnel working in Antarctica,

Considering the valuable contribution which could be made
by introducing to the Antarctic area the principles developed by
a world-wide weather-forecasting organization,

The Delegates RECOMMEND that their Governments adopt the
proposals emerging from the 18th and 20th Sessions of the World
Meteorological Organization Executive Committee, with a view to
the establishment of meteorological stations at McMurdo,
Molodeshnaya and Aguirre Cerda.

Annexes : 2                                      Geneva, II November I968

Dear Sir,

I wish to refer to my letter No.25.229/T/AA/TP of I7 October I968, addressed to Ministers of Foreign Affairs of WMO Members signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, a copy of which you should have already received. The annex to that letter consisted of a statement to the Fifth Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty States on present and planned meteorological activities in the Antarctic forming part of the World Weather Watch.

In the letter itself I also referred to the inquiry initiated by my letter no. 20.464/T/AA of I6 August I968 and stated that further information on the results of the inquiry would be sent to Permanent Representatives before the Fifth Consultative Meeting if sufficient replies were received in time. Most WMO Members concerned have now replied, although it is clear that full and final information on the requirements of these Members for Antarctic data is not, in all cases, yet available. You will no doubt recall my suggestion that the information sought be provided in the same tabulated form used by the Executive Committee Working Group on Antarctic Meteorology at its first session. The replies received to date do not permit the establishment of completely revised Tables I to 4 and it is thought that it will only be possible to do this at the second session of the working group in early I969.

However, in order to provide some more recent information I believe it will be useful to Members to receive such material as can be given in the form previously used. Appendix A to this letter accordingly consists of the new information received and is set out under the heading of the four tables mentioned above. I should like to emphasize again that these tables should not be taken as replacements for the earlier tables but simply as a convenient method of setting out the requirements of Members as notified in response to the recent inquiry. Since many of the earlier requirements specified still remain valid, the new material should be read in conjunction with the earlier tables.

To Permanent Representatives of WMO Members
which are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty
-2-

With regard to the requirements for the collection of 
Antarctic data, both as regards time-delays and telecommunica-
tion links, reference is made to the decisions of the eighte-
enth session of the Executive Committee as recorded in Resolu-
tion 6 (EC-XVIII) and the annex thereto. I should like to add 
that the U.S.S.R. has now expressed specific views in this res-
pect and these are given in Appendix B to this letter. Similarly 
Appendix B also gives the U.S.S.R. views on the collection of 
ships' weather reports from the area south of 60°S following 
the decision of the Executive Committee as recorded in paragraph 
4.7.8. of the General Summary of its twentieth session.

I have taken this step of sending you incomplete infor-
mation on Members' Antarctic data requirements because of the 
imminence of the Fifth Consultative Meeting which is scheduled 
to open in Paris on 18 November 1968. In making whatever use 
you may feel to be desirable of this information, I would ask 
you to stress its incompleteness and provisional nature to 
avoid any risk of misunderstanding. It is very much to be hoped 
that the Consultative Meeting will find it possible to support 
a mechanism which will enable the Antarctic system to take full 
account of the changing requirements.

Yours faithfully,

Signed : D.A. DAVIES

No. 27.014/T/AA/TP, APPENDIX  B

U.S.S.R.  STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATION CHANNELS
AND VIEWS ON COLLECTION OF SHIPS' REPORTS

"Please retain existing telecommunication channels Mirny-
McMurdo, Mirny-Mawson, Mirny-Wilkes, Mirny-New Amsterdam, Mirny-
Dumont d'Urville, Molodeznaja-Syowa, Novolazarevskaja-SANAE,
Bellingshausen-Orcadas, Bellingshausen-Gonzalez Videla . For each
station there should be six communication runs (contacts per day)
-four for synoptic and two for aerological information. We urgen-
tly need direct connexion with Port Stanley and Marion Is. with 
which our stations Bellingshausen and Novolazarevskaja can work 
on Morse code".

"In our opinion it would be advisable to organize reception
of synoptic reports from ships in the area to the south of 60°S
at stations Mirny, Molodeznaja, Novolazarevskaja, Bellingshausen
and also consider possibility of reception of this information at
other countries' station, organize exchange of ship and surface
stations information."
