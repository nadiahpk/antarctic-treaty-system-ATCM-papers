Note presented by the French Delegation on one
aspect of the problem of Telecommunications in Antarctic.

The Fifth Consultative Meeting of the States
Signatories of the Antarctic Treaty is taking place at
the moment when begins, in the frame of the World Meteo-
rological Watch (WMW), the installation of the world
meteorological telecommunications system. This telecommuni-
cations system has a goal which would permit, by employing
defined techniques and proceedures of transmission
employed by every Meteorological Service, to exchange all
meteorological data in accordance to the needs of each
Service, whether it will concern the observations, analysis
of meteorological situations or of forecastings.

Within the frame of the WMW, certain meteorologi-
cal centers perform certain jobs that require the know-
ledge of forecasts throughout the whole world, while other
centers need only partial ones. The meteorological data
from the Antarctic should, therefore, enter into the world
telecommunications system, which means that the Antarctic
telecommunication network should be compatible with the
one of the world meteorological telecommunications system.

The French Delegation therefore desires to
discuss this problem during the Meeting.
