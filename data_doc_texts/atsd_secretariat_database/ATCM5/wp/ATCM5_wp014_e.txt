Note presented by the French Delegation on the
Gathering of meteorological messages from
the ships.

The meteorological observations on the ships
present an evident interest in navigational zones where
they constitute the only source of information on the
value of the parameters utilized in Meteorology. Combined
with the observations of clouds layers by meteorological
satellites, they permit the analysis of meteorological
situation.

The gathering of meteorological messages from the
ships has, therefore, a great importance and should be
the object of a coordinated plan valid for all the ships
that are to the South of the 60th Parallel.
