DRAFT RECOMMENDATION

SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS :
FILDES PENINSULA

( submitted by the United Kingdom )

The Representatives, considering that Fildes Peninsula
has several small lakes which, being ice-free in summer, are
of outstanding ecological interest and that the most interesting
one of them should be specially protected recommend to their
Governments that, in place of the description in Recommendation
IV-12, the following be inserted in Annex B, Specially Protected
Areas, of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Fauna and Flora :

"SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREA No. 12, Fildes Peninsula,
King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Lat. 62°20'S,
long. 58°52'W.

Description : The fresh-water lake, including the surrounding
land within 100 metres of the shore, situated
about 500 metres north of Suffield Point and 2.5 kilometres
East-North-East of Bellingshausen on Fildes Peninsula.
(The area is shown on the attached map.)"
