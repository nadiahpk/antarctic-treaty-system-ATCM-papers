Lillie Marleen Hut was erected to support the work of the German Antarctic Northern Victoria Land Expedition (GANOVEX I) of 1979/1980.  The hut, a bivouac container made of prefabricated fiberglass units insulated with polyurethane foam, was named after the Lillie Glacier and the song “Lili Marleen”.  The hut is closely associated with the dramatic sinking of the expedition ship “Gotland II” during GANOVEX II in December 1981.
