Draft Work Programme 2005/6

Introduction

This Work Programme outlines the activities proposed for the Secretariat in the financial year 2005/6 (1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006)1. It is accompanied by the following annexes:
    • Annex 1: Draft budget 2005/6, arranged by appropriations and by outputs 
    • Annex 2: Forecast budget 2006/7
    • Annex 3: Contribution scale 2006/7
    • Annex 4: Salary scale 2005/6
The Programme and the accompanying budget figures are based on Forecast Budget for 2005/6 (Decision 2 (2004), Attachment 4) and the actual work experience of the initial period from September 1st 2004. During these few initial months our main effort was devoted to set up the infrastructure of the ATS and to recruit the staff considered necessary for this starting period. 
The financial year 2005/6 is the first regular financial year for the Secretariat; the financial year 2004/5 started in September 2004 and only contained seven months.   
Management 
The basic establishment needs of the Secretariat in terms of recruitment of personnel, acquisition of equipment, IT development have been filled.  The priority tasks for this year are now the preparation of the 28th ATCM and 29th ATCM, publication of the Final Reports, building up the ATS website, and the development of data infrastructure in support of the web page and the various data management tasks assigned to the Secretariat. Specific tasks will also depend on the decisions taken by the 28th ATCM.
Administrative/technical staff		
At the beginning of the financial year the permanent staff consisted of the Executive Secretary, the Assistant Executive Officer, one Information Officer and a Secretary/Administrative Assistant. Other personnel (data entry, translation and accounting assistants) are hired on a part time basis to deal with tasks which do not amount to a full day’s work or which have a temporary character.  Specific technical assistance (such as web and database design) is also contracted out. 
In order to strengthen the Secretariat’s capacity to handle data management tasks expected to be assigned by the ATCM it will be necessary to recruit a person with good technical qualifications as IT Officer.  For the preparation of Final Reports, Handbooks, guidelines, newsletters etc. we plan to recruit an Editor.  These staff will be recruited in the same way as the earlier administrative/technical staff, that is, by the publication of vacancy notices in the English language newspaper the Buenos Aires Herald.  The Consultative Parties will be informed of the vacancies. The permanent staff will be supplemented by part-time staff in fields such as accounting, translation, and data input, and by trainees from Argentina and abroad for shorter periods and specific projects.
Financial matters
The budget has been compiled using the figures in the Forecast Budget, with some adjustments on the basis of the actual experience of the Secretariat so far.  Assuming that the Consultative Parties will make assessed voluntary contributions at the same rate as the previous year, the budget will be roughly in balance.  
The United States intends to make its contribution for 2004 in the form of a restricted grant of US $30.000 to strengthen the Secretariat’s database development and documentary infrastructure.  It is proposed that a Special Fund be set up according to Regulation 6.2 (d) of the Financial Regulations to deal with this contribution, which will be used for the items Computers, Software Development and Documentation Material.  
Specific Tasks
Section headings refer to the paragraphs of Art. 2 of Measure 1 (2003)	
(a) Preparation for the 28th ATCM and CEP 8
The secretariat has assumed the responsibility for preparing the agenda and gathering and collating the working and information papers for the 28th ATCM and publishing them on the restricted area of the ATS website. The web site for the 28th ATCM has been operational from April 22nd 2005. Use of a database of meta-data on the papers allows easier multilingual access and quicker updating of the information.  Similar technology will be used for providing access to the ATCM recommendations and other documents.
The Secretariat has assumed responsibility for the contracting of the translation and interpretation for the ATCM.  The contract has been granted, as in the past years, to the team of Mr. Bernard Ponette.  The Swedish Government as host of the 28th ATCM will reimburse the Secretariat for the costs of translation and interpretation during the meeting, and the pre-meeting translation and editing and publication of the Final Report are included in the Secretariat budget.     
(b) Support intersessional work of the ATCM and the CEP
The secretariat will provide support in the organization of any intersessional meetings planned by the ATCM. 	
(c) Facilitate exchange of information required under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol
The Secretariat will support work to improve the efficiency and transparency of the exchange of information among the Consultative Parties as required under the Antarctic Treaty and the Environment Protocol. In the set-up of the Secretariat databases and website, provision is being made for facilities for the exchange of information through the website. The specific activities to be undertaken on this regard are subject to the decisions that the ATCM will take on this matter. 	
(d) Co-ordination and contact with other elements of the Antarctic Treaty System, and other relevant international bodies and organizations
Under the guidance of the ATCM the Executive Secretary in the current financial year will attend the annual meeting of COMNAP and visit the CCAMLR Secretariat at the time of the annual meeting of the CCAMLR Commission, as well as attending such other meetings as agreed to by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties pursuant to Rule (X).
 (e) Development and maintenance of databases
The data model set up for the documents of the 28th ATCM will be further developed to include the recommendations, Measures, Decisions and Resolutions of the previous ATCMs, the contact points of the ATCP and other Antarctic organizations and, depending on the decisions of the ATCM, other data relevant to the tasks of the Secretariat. 		
(f) Circulation amongst the Parties relevant information and disseminate information on activities in Antarctica 
The Secretariat and its website will function as a clearinghouse for information on the Parties’ activities and relevant developments in Antarctica. It will include links to all other relevant websites.  Information will be circulated also through circulars, notes, and newsletters.
(g) Collection, maintenance and publication of ATCM/CEP records
Consultative Parties that have hosted ATCM’s have been be asked to provide the Secretariat with authentic copies of all reports of the ATCM’s and other meetings they have hosted, so that the Secretariat will become a complete and reliable repository of the documents of the ATCM.   The recommendations, measures, decisions and resolutions of the ATCM will be digitized if electronic copies of them don’t exist yet.  With these records, the database of ATCM recommendations, which is almost complete as far as the English language documents are concerned, will be expanded to include the other language versions of the documents.  At a later stage, Working Papers and Information Papers of the recent meetings will also be added.  The database will be made available through the ATS website before the 29th ATCM.
(h) Facilitate the availability of information about the Antarctic Treaty system
The Secretariat will continue with improvement of the visibility of the Antarctic Treaty System through its website, through the ATS newsletter and through pamphlets, and other publicity activities. Publication and distribution of guidelines adopted by the ATCM and versions of the ATCM documents oriented towards the general public are also being considered. 
(i) Preparation of reports on the Secretariat’s activities
Under this heading falls the task of preparing the reports and budgets of the Secretariat for the ATCM.
(j) Assisting the review of past Recommendations and Measures
The examination and review of past Recommendations and Measures of the ATCM, which is at present focusing on the Protected Area System, will be assisted by the Secretariat.  Although this work is essential to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the system of ATCM rule-making, during the annual meeting there usually is not enough time for the legal experts of the Consultative Parties to focus on this.  The ATCM might consider the possibility of holding a workshop at the Secretariat with experts from the Consultative Parties to prepare a decision during the 29th ATCM.  
(k) Maintenance and updating of the Antarctic Treaty System Handbook		
The Secretariat is considering publishing the Antarctic treaty handbook in separate volumes instead of in one volume.  A possible design might be as follows:
Vol. 1 Basic Texts and Operation of the ATCM and CEP
Vol. 2 Environmental Protection
Vol. 3 Operational and Scientific Matters
Vol. 4 Tourism and non-governmental activities
Vol. 5 Recommendations, Measures, Decisions and Resolutions
