PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO
THE RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR
ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS 
Decision 1 (2004)


PARTICIPATION OF THIRD COUNTRIES 
IN ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE
MEETINGS 














PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE
FOR ANTARCTIC TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETINGS


INTRODUCTION

The main interest of countries that are Parties to the Antarctic Treaty System is to promote the principles and objectives of the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection, as well as to strengthen the Antarctic Treaty System as a whole.

In order to enhance and consolidate the institutionalization of the Antarctic Treaty at the international level, Chile considers it a priority that those countries interested in conducting activities within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty System become Parties to the Antarctic Treaty.  

To this end, the delegation from Chile, concerned about the requests of third countries to participate as guests in previous Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and about the possibility that this situation may repeat itself in the future, considers it necessary to regulate the attendance of these countries to the Antarctic Treaty System meetings.   

Therefore, the Chilean delegation submits for consideration to the XXVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting the following proposed amendment to the “Revised Rules of Procedures”, approved at the XXVII ATCM through Decision 1 (2004), on the participation of third countries (non-Consultative Parties) in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.     



PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE 
DECISION 1 (2004)

After No. 30 add the subtitle:

 Non-Consultative Parties

Add as No. 31 “Those countries that are not Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty -- but that have a scientific interest in or are participating in scientific research programs, tourism activities, or other activities permitted by the Antarctic Treaty-- that request an invitation to participate in Antarctic Treaty System meetings, should direct their requests to the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.  The request should include a Commitment Document --a commitment to the principles and objectives of the Antarctic Treaty System as a whole so as to strengthen and fulfill its provisions-- and express their intention to abide by the Treaty during the next 5 years.  	


A country with special invitation to the meeting will only participate in plenary sessions and in those working groups agreed upon by the Consultative Parties during the first general session.

The Executive Secretary should submit the requests to all Consultative Parties for their approval.          

Add as No. 32 “Non-Consultative Parties should send requests at least 120 days before the Consultative Meeting or any other meeting of the Antarctic Treaty System.
