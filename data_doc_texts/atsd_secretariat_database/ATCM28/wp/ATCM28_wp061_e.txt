The Representatives,


Recalling Article 3 of the Environmental Protocol which requires that activities in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment,

Noting the importance which Article 14 of the Protocol attaches to inspections in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty as a way to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems; 
Noting also that the issue of fuel storage and handling has been raised in several reports of inspections under Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty and has been noted by the CEP on a number of occasions; 

Conscious of the importance of bringing the issue of fuel storage and handling to the attention of the Treaty Parties;

Recommend that: 
Their governments replace bulk fuel facilities currently lacking secondary containment either with double-skinned tanks, or provide them with adequate bunding and have adequate oil spill contingency plans in place;

That COMNAP consider undertaking a further assessment of fuel handling and storage facilities and procedures in Antarctica with a view to issuing a set of clear recommendations to operators.
