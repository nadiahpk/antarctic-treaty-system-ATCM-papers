Antarctic Treaty Secretariat 
Report 1 September 2004 – 31 March 2005

Antarctic Treaty Secretariat 
Report 1 September 2004 – 31 March 2005
Introduction
This report covers the period from the start of the Secretariat on 1 September 2004 to the end of the first financial year on 31 March 2005.  It is accompanied by a separate Financial Report (see Attachment) consisting of a statement of income and expenditures arranged by appropriations, the same figures arranged by outputs and a balance sheet as of 31 March 2005.  In Annex 1 to the present report you will find a summary of the Parties’ contributions for 2004.  Annex 2 contains a letter from the Argentine Foreign Ministry concerning the exemption from certain foreign exchange charges (see below).
Please note that the financial report is only an interim report covering the first seven months of activity.  The statement of income and expenditures the Financial Report shows a large surplus, which is inevitable considering that this was the start up period of the Secretariat.  After a full year of operations and an audit, the 29th ATCM will be in a better position to form a judgment on the financial needs of the Secretariat and the adequacy of the budget.  The Financial Report has not yet been audited, since the ATCM has not yet appointed the External Auditor (see Regulation 11).  A proposal for such an appointment will be made by Argentina. 
Management
Personnel
The most important management task in the first few months was the recruitment of staff.
Executive staff
The recruitment of the Assistant Executive Officer started with an announcement sent by email to the Consultative Parties immediately after the 27th ATCM.  After the vacancy had been published by various means by the Consultative Parties, 64 applications were received from 17 countries.  At the end of October a shortlist of ten candidates was announced.  The Executive Secretary was able to interview eight of the ten short listed candidates in person, and had telephone interviews with the other two.  In December Mr. José Maria Acero from Argentina was appointed for a term of three years.  He was granted a leave of absence by the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, his previous employer, and started work on January 1, 2005. 
Administrative/technical staff
After evaluating various proposals, the firm of Manpower Argentina was chosen to handle local recruiting.  Two full time positions were announced in the English language newspaper, the Buenos Aires Herald: Information Officer and Secretary/Administrative Assistant.  Mr. José Luis Agraz, formerly at the Argentine Antarctic Institute, was appointed in October to the position of Information Officer, and Ms. Gloria Fontan started in December as Secretary/Administrative Assistant.
After consultation with the financial consulting firms of KPMG and Price Waterhouse Cooper it was concluded that the volume of financial transactions of the Secretariat would not justify the appointment of a full time Financial Officer.  Accordingly an independent registered accountant was engaged on a part time basis to set up and keep the Secretariat’s accounts.
Some of the tasks of the Secretariat, such as the setting up of the database of ATCM documents, have a temporary character.  Accordingly the work of entering and editing data was entrusted to interns and outside experts on a project basis. 
Staff Regulations
In the process of consulting embassies and other international organisations and legal counsel concerning the employment procedures for the Secretariat, a serious contradiction was found to exist between the Staff Regulations as established in Decision 3 (2003) and Argentine labour law.  Argentinean law requires that employers register their employees with the authorities, make contributions for their employees to various social welfare funds, and withhold the employees’ contributions from their salaries.  The Staff Regulations, however, provide for the payment of a gross salary and require the employees to be responsible for their own social, medical and retirement insurance (Article 8).  The assumption underlying the Staff Regulations seems to have been that the employees of the Secretariat would not be subject to Argentine labour and social laws.  However, the Headquarters Agreement concluded between the ATCM and the Argentinean Government does not contain any text supporting such an assumption; on the contrary, whenever any provision of a financial nature is mentioned (as in Articles 16, 17 and 18) Argentinean nationals are explicitly excluded.  The presumption must be, therefore, that Argentinean staff members are subject to Argentine labour law.
In order to carry out the Staff Regulations, and at the same time not bring the Argentine staff members into open conflict with the tax authorities, the staff members concerned have for the time being registered themselves with the tax authorities as independent consultants.  This means, however, that there is a serious contradiction between their status for the Secretariat and their status for the Argentine authorities.  This could create risks and inconveniences for the Secretariat and the ATCM, especially if at a future date there would be friction between the Secretariat and any staff member concerning his or her employment conditions.  
This problem could be solved in two ways.  The ATCM might decide to seek changes in the Headquarters Agreement in order to specify that Argentinean staff members are only bound by the Staff Regulations and do not fall under the provisions of Argentinean labour and social legislation.  However, any such changes would then have to be negotiated with the Argentinean Government and approved by the Argentine Parliament.  This would probably be a lengthy and complicated process.  
Alternatively, the Staff Regulations could be amended to specify that staff members who are Argentinean nationals or residents, and who therefore are excluded from the privileges and immunities specified in Article 16 and 17 of the Headquarters Agreement, are subject to the applicable Argentinean law.  This would mean amending Regulation 5 and 8 among others.  If the ATCM would choose this option, the Secretariat could seek expert advice and prepare a draft set of amendments for consideration by the 29th ATCM.
Financial affairs
After comparison of a number of proposals by banks with international experience active in Buenos Aires, it was decided to establish bank accounts with the state-owned Banco de la Nación Argentina.  The transfer of the balance held by the CCAMLR Secretariat in Hobart, Australia, for the Secretariat, and the collection of contributions for the financial year 2005/6 was delayed for some months.  This was due to the application to the dollar account of the Secretariat of certain restrictions under the foreign exchange regulations in place since the Argentine financial crisis of 2001, which were in contravention of the provisions of Article 12 of the Headquarters Agreement.  After discussions with the authorities concerned, the Secretariat in March, 2005 obtained an exemption from these restrictions and was able to begin normal financial operations.  Annex 3 contains the letter from the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirming the exemption.  
IT and Communication Infrastructure
After a thorough evaluation of proposals by a number of telephone and computer enterprises relating to the telephone, fax, email and internet connections for the Secretariat and its office network and computers, the contract for the lease of the computer and printing equipment was granted to the firm of Rack2 S.R.L.  This contract also includes software, maintenance, technical services and security provisions. The contract for telecommunication services, internet access and email services was awarded to Impsat S.A.  The Secretariat now has an up to date computer network, fast internet access, a digital telephone network and printing equipment.
Legal matters
Proposals were solicited from a number of qualified local law firms.  After a comparison of the proposals, the Secretariat engaged the firm of Wessels & Mendez Abogados to provide legal advice on a regular basis. 
Specific Tasks
Section headings refer to the paragraphs of Art. 2 of Measure 1 (2003).  
(a) Preparation for the 28th  ATCM and CEP 8
After definition of the data model for the necessary information about the working papers, information papers, recommendations and attachments of the ATCM, a database was developed by a group of database experts contracted by the Secretariat.  Then, on the basis of this database, a web page with dynamic information on the papers for the 28th ATCM was developed by the web design firm of BaseHead Digital Media.  The web page became operational on 22 April 2005. 
At the request of the Swedish Government, host to the 28th ATCM, the Secretariat assumed responsibility for the contracting of the translation and interpretation services for the ATCM.  As in previous years, these services will be provided by the team of Mr. Bernard Ponette.  
(b) Support intersessional work of the ATCM and the CEP
(c) Facilitate exchange of information required under the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol
(d) Co-ordination and contact with other elements of, and international organisations, on matters relevant to the Antarctic Treaty system
The Executive Secretary attended the 23d annual meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in Hobart, Tasmania, in November 2004.  This visit provided a good chance to observe the operations of the CCAMLR Secretariat, to seek advice on the setting up of the Secretariat and to thank the CCAMLR Secretariat for the good care of the Secretariat contributions which were held by them until they were transferred to the Secretariat.  
(e) Development and maintenance of databases
In the report period, a beginning has been made with the development of the data model for the Secretariat data bases, which will include data on the Parties, their contact points and the documents of the ATCM.  Documents lacking in the existing database of ATCM recommendations have been added, and the collection of English language materials in the database is now almost complete, while work has started on making the database multilingual.  
(f) Circulation amongst the Parties relevant information and disseminate information on activities in Antarctica
In February, the Secretariat started publishing a Newsletter in English and Spanish, with internal news about the secretariat and items of general interest contributed by the Parties.
(g) Collection, maintenance and publication of ATCM/CEP records
Consultative Parties that have hosted ATCM’s have been asked to provide the Secretariat with authentic copies of the reports of the ATCM’s and other meetings they have hosted, and final reports, working papers etc. have started to arrive at the Secretariat.  
(h) Facilitate the availability of information about the Antarctic Treaty system
(i) Preparation of reports on the Secretariat’s activities
(j) Assisting the review of past Recommendations and Measures
(k) Maintenance and updating of the Antarctic Treaty System Handbook

Mr. Executive Secretary,
It is my pleasure to answer your letter ATS/2004/35e to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Rafael Bielsa, concerning foreign currency bank transfers which are essential for the efficient development of the activities of the Secretariat.
I am happy to confirm to you that the administrative regulations of the National Bank of Argentina have been adjusted to meet the needs of the Secretariat and that the Secretariat will be fully exempt from the imposition of foreign exchange rate differentials in its operations.
I sincerely regret the initial difficulties you encountered due to the particular circumstances of the operational procedures required by the Antarctic Treaty Secretary in its permanent office in the Argentine Republic.

Sincerely yours,

(signed)

Rubén Néstor Patto
Minister
Director General, Antarctic Division
