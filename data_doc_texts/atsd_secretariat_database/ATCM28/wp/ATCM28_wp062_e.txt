The Representatives,
Noting that under Resolution 1 (1999) the ATCM adopted Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment; 
Conscious of the need for these guidelines to better address the possible cumulative impacts arising from multiple activities at multiple locations undertaken by one or more national or private operator; 
Considering the revision by the Committee of Environmental Protection of these guidelines; 
Recommend that:
The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment adopted by Resolution 1 (1999) be replaced by the amended guidelines attached to this text.
