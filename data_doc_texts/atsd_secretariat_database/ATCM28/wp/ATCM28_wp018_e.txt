Report of the intersessional contact group on accreditation scheme for Antarctic tour operators

REPORT OF THE INTERSESSIONAL CONTACT GROUP ON ACCREDITATION SCHEME FOR ANTARCTIC TOUR OPERATORS

Working Paper submitted by the United Kingdom

Background

    1. The issue of Accreditation for Antarctic Tourism was first raised by Australia at the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on Antarctic Tourism in March 2004.  Australia subsequently submitted a Working Paper to ATCM XXVII (WP-38), which proposed the establishment of an Intersessional Contact Group (ICG) to further consider the concept of an Accreditation Scheme.  The ATCM agreed to the establishment of such an ICG and approved the terms of reference (TOR), which are attached at Annex A.

    2. The ICG was co-ordinated by the United Kingdom.  Participants were identified from Argentina; Australia; Chile; Finland; France; Germany; Italy; New Zealand; Norway; Sweden; Ukraine; United States; Uruguay; Czech Republic; COMNAP; ASOC; IAATO; and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.  However, throughout the ICG specific views were only received from nine Parties and two Experts.  The views expressed in this paper are therefore only representative of a minority of Antarctic Treaty Parties.  Nevertheless, we hope that the intersessional work reflected in this paper will further assist the debate on Accreditation.

    3. There were three rounds of e-mail exchanges on the full range of issues identified in the TOR.  Full reports of the comments provided during each of these rounds are at Annex B.

Conclusions

    4. The ICG clearly identified a range of diverse views on the issue of an Accreditation Scheme for Antarctic Tourism.  During the discussions over the past year, some of the areas of relative agreement and disagreement on matters of principle included:

Key areas of general agreement (amongst those expressing views on these issues):
    • Identification of existing legal obligations and non-mandatory guidance relating to Antarctic tourism activities;
    • Recognition that not all Parties had enacted the existing legal obligations, and that there were inconsistencies in implementation between Parties;
    • Identification of a number of areas relevant to Antarctic Tourism, which were beyond the scope of the Environmental Protocol, where additional regulations may be desirable;
    • The need to minimise complexity and bureaucracy in any proposed Accreditation Scheme and avoid conflict and duplication with existing national legislation.  A ‘step by step’ approach was preferred in order to retain flexibility.  A proactive information exchange mechanism would need to be established; 
    • The ATCM should oversee and monitor any Accreditation Scheme.

Key areas where differences could not be reconciled:
    • Whether an Accreditation Scheme should be voluntary or mandatory, as well as whether any scheme itself should be mandatory, or whether standards within the scheme should be mandatory;
    • Whether there had yet been sufficient policy discussion of the issues that an Accreditation Scheme was being asked to address, and whether an Accreditation Scheme was the most effective means of addressing any such issues;
    • Establishment of mechanisms to first ensure compliance with existing standards, prior to the establishment of any Accreditation Scheme;
    • Possible linkages to existing international Accreditation Schemes – whether these could be used as a foundation or model for any Antarctic scheme.

Next Steps

    5. It is clear from the ICG discussions that there is a broad range of views - on points of principle, as well as the detail of how any Accreditation Scheme for Antarctic Tourism should be operated.  These differences were such that it was not possible to reconcile them through e-mail exchanges in the time available.  There is therefore a need for the above key issues where the ICG did not reach agreement to be addressed within the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, to give a clear policy steer to inform any further dialogue on this matter.

    6. We also understand that IAATO will be submitting a paper outlining their own development of an Accreditation Scheme and would propose that this, and any other papers that may be tabled by Parties, Observers and Experts, be considered by the ATCM, in tandem with the findings of the ICG exchanges.

Annex A

Terms of Reference for Intersessional Contact Group on Accreditation Scheme for Antarctic Tour Operators, as agreed at ATCM XXVII

The meeting decided to establish an intersessional contact group to further examine proposals for the development of an Accreditation Scheme that would add value to existing mechanisms to manage tourist activities in Antarctica.  The meeting agreed that the terms of reference for the intersessional contact group would be to:

    1. (a)	identify mechanisms to ensure that an accreditation system does not duplicate the requirements of existing legal obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System;
     (b) discuss the implementation of those legal obligations; and
     (c) identify any implications for Parties that may arise from the operation of an Accreditation Scheme.

    2. Consider the form and content of an Accreditation Scheme and develop a framework for its implementation, which may take into account work undertaken by IAATO and other organisations and Parties.

    3. Consider the scope of applicability of an Accreditation Scheme across the range of tourist activities occurring or likely to occur in the Antarctic Treaty Area.

    4. Identify the processes by which the ATCM would establish or endorse the standards that would underpin an Accreditation Scheme.

    5. Examine the likely costs associated with, and financing of, the operation of an Accreditation Scheme.

    6. Report to XXVIII ATCM on its work.
Annex B

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED ON FIRST ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS:

Key aim: Identify existing legal obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System for managing tourism activities in Antarctica and discuss current implementation of those obligations.

1.  Comments on this round were received from Argentina; Australia; Germany; New Zealand; Norway; United Kingdom and IAATO.

A. Existing Legal Obligations under the Antarctic Treaty / Environmental Protocol

2.  The ICG identified the following summary position of the existing legal obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System for managing tourism:

    • Pre-Environmental Protocol: 
    • Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty requires Parties to give advance notification of all expeditions to and within Antarctica on the part of its ships or nationals, and all expeditions organised in, or proceeding from its Territory;
    • There were five Recommendations relating to tourism adopted between 1966 and 1979. However, whilst these remain extant, in many cases they have been largely superseded by the Protocol and later instruments. (There are nevertheless specific issues within Recommendations VIII-9 (tourists landing only within Special Areas of Tourism Interest) and X-8 (overflights) that may be of direct relevance, but the status of these instruments needs to be clarified);
    • Environmental Protocol:
    • Tourism and non-Governmental expeditions to Antarctica are implicitly referenced in Article VII (5) of the Antarctic Treaty; and explicitly included in Articles 3 (Environmental Principles), 8 (Environmental Impact Assessment) and 15 (Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning) of the Protocol.  
    • These references to tourism, particularly those in the Environmental Principles (Article 3 of the Protocol), reinforced by the more generic references to “activities” throughout the Protocol, confirm that in effect, all provisions under the Protocol and its annexes (existing or future) apply to tourism activities.  But clearly this only covers the environmental aspects of tourism activities.  It was also noted that tourist activities have become more complex since the adoption of the Protocol in 1991; and
    • Since adoption of the Protocol: 
    • Key instruments are:
    • Recommendation XVIII(1) on tourism guidelines; 
    • Resolution 3(1995) and Resolution 3(1997), both on tourism reporting;
    • Resolution 6(1999) on the Protocol and non-Consultative Parties; 
    • Resolution 6(2001) on information exchange and Resolution 3(2004) on enhanced co-operation on tourism activities among Parties; and
    • Measure 4(2004) and Resolution 4(2004) on insurance and contingency planning.
(However, it is worth noting that neither Recommendation XVIII(1), nor Measure 4(2004) have yet become effective under Article IX (4) of the Antarctic Treaty).
In addition, Measures containing ASMAs and ASPAs may require Parties to manage or regulate tourism

3.  ICG Participants also noted that a number of obligations within the Antarctic Treaty (Articles VII and X) and the Environmental Protocol (Articles 2 and 3) may impose obligations relevant to the management of tourism activities.  Similarly, there have also been several Resolutions that may have relevance to the management of tourism activities, including:
    • Resolution 1(1997) – Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning;
    • Resolution 3(2001) – Collection of Meteorites in Antarctica;
    • Resolution 5(2001) – Guidelines for handling of pre-1958 Historic Remains whose existence or present location is not known; and
    • Resolution 2(2004) – Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft near Concentrations of Birds.

4.  It was also noted that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties were in the process of establishing a legal framework for shipping.

5.  In summary, a number of agreements have been reached by the ATCM on tourism.  The majority are non-mandatory (Resolutions), whilst the relevant mandatory texts have not yet entered into force.

B. Implementation of the Antarctic Treaty / Environmental Protocol Obligations:

Discussion Question: What gaps (if any) exist between obligations under the Antarctic Treaty / Environmental Protocol and national implementation?

6.  None of the ICG Participants from Treaty Parties participating in this round of discussion saw any gaps in their existing legislation.  (Although it was noted that there was an inevitable delay for some Parties to enact new provisions adopted by the ATCM into their domestic legislation).

7.  However, it was noted that the fact that national implementation has occurred in such a way that each Party is capable of meeting all obligations imposed under the Antarctic Treaty and the Environmental Protocol does not necessarily mean that implementation has occurred in the most effective, or consistent, manner.  Moreover, the tourist industry reported that out of 14 Parties where known tourist activities are organised, over a third did not require advance notification, one fifth did not require EIA to be undertaken and a quarter did not require post visit site reports.

Discussion Question: Whether any gaps or loopholes have come to light through national implementation of the Antarctic Treaty / Environmental Protocol which suggest that additional obligations are needed to provide for the effective management / regulation of Antarctic Tourism?

8.  ICG members highlighted a number of areas, which were beyond the scope of the Environmental Protocol and thus national implementing legislation, where additional regulations may be desirable.  These included:
    • Additional requirements for Antarctic shipping, including:
    • the treatment of ballast water; 
    • anti-fouling coating;
    • ice strengthening (particularly until the Antarctic Shipping Guidelines come into force); and 
    • prohibition of heavy fuel oil.
    • Additional obligations needed to address legal issues raised by the establishment of permanent and semi-permanent tourism infrastructure on land, including addressing any question of property rights;
    • Additional requirements to address safety issues, particularly in the context of tourism overflights;
    • Additional requirements for the management of tourists within Antarctica, including:
    • Procedures for the operation and refuelling of small boats;
    • Setting of minimum ratios of guides to tourists at landing sites;
    • Level of Antarctic experience/training required by tour guides;
    • Type and level of briefing provided to tourists on their environmental obligations.
    • Procedures for assessing, verifying and monitoring impacts from all tourist activities (though it was noted that the issue of EIA procedures and cumulative impacts is the subject of a separate ICG).

9.  It was, however, noted that it may not be desirable, or implementable to try to address all of these issues through an Accreditation Scheme, and that a number of these issues are not specific to tourism.

10.  The issue of inspections and observers for tourist activities was also highlighted.  Whilst this was not necessarily considered to be beyond the scope of the Environmental Protocol, there were different views as to whether the current Antarctic Treaty System framework could be used to enforce a mandatory requirement that such observers be appointed.   The issue of resources for such activities was also highlighted.

11.  In contemplating what areas a new Accreditation Scheme might cover, the issue of avoiding duplication with the requirements of existing domestic legislation should be given further consideration.  It was also suggested that the establishment of an Accreditation Scheme could be linked to the standards set out in existing international Accreditation Schemes, such as ISO9000 and ISO14000.  These might provide a mechanism whereby additional obligations for Antarctic Tourism activities could be elaborated.
  
12.  The development of an Accreditation Scheme would, nevertheless, potentially help to avoid duplication, and would comprehensively bring together all of the existing (and likely future) obligations for Antarctic tourist activities.  This would assist both national competent authorities, and to the tourist industry.  Such a scheme would also be able to draw on ‘best practice’ and provide better consistency of tourism operations in Antarctica.

13.  It was highlighted that IAATO has already developed a set of generic operating standards for tourism operators, particularly to cover the management of tourists within Antarctica (although these did not apply to non-IAATO members).  The information that IAATO collects from tourist operators is used proactively to manage tourism within Antarctica, particularly in the context of managing ship visits to key sites.  If the ATCM were to develop an Accreditation Scheme, it would need to ensure that it did not create a purely information-based system that undermined the current high level of tourism management undertaken by IAATO.  Pro-active information exchange from all Parties would be a key factor in delivering a scheme that had practical use for the day to day management of Antarctic Tourism activities.


ICG on Accreditation of Antarctic Tourism
October 2004
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED ON SECOND ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS

Key aim: Discuss options for overall framework of an Accreditation Scheme and consider how such a scheme might impact on Parties.

1.  Comments were received from Australia; Germany; New Zealand; Norway; Uruguay and IAATO.  UK comments were included in the summary below.  ASOC also highlighted a recent report by WWF International on Cruise Tourism on Svalbard – A Risky Business?

C. Options for overall framework of an Accreditation Scheme:

2.  There was general agreement among ICG participants that the overall Accreditation Scheme should be to support the consistent implementation of existing (and future) legal instruments under the Antarctic Treaty.  There was some concern that the problems associated with tourism and other activities had yet to be fully articulated, so it was not possible to judge whether an Accreditation Scheme would actually be the best method of tackling such issues.  Nevertheless, it was noted that the scheme would provide a useful way of collating all the relevant regulations into one place for tourist operators.

3.  It was also noted that an Accreditation Scheme could be implemented on a gradual ‘step-by-step’ basis, and that it should be flexible enough to accommodate further standards/requirements being added in the future, as they were adopted by the ATCM.  One respondent, however, commented that it should be adequate as a first step (and prior to the establishment of an accreditation body) to require evidence of compliance with domestic legislation. Ensuring that the Accreditation Scheme does not conflict in any way with the implementation of domestic legislation would be vital.

Discussion Question: Should the ATCM seek to develop a bespoke Accreditation Scheme for Antarctic Tourism, or should the ATCM seek to expand on an existing accreditation mechanism?

4.  Whilst on the one hand, the benefit of drawing on the expertise of existing accreditation mechanisms was recognised, the importance of taking into account the special nature of Antarctica and the role of the ATCM was highlighted. Whilst elements of ISOs 9000 and 14001 could be useful, a note of caution was raised in respect of the stringent approval process such schemes already require. 

5.  It was generally acknowledged that the ATCM would need to adopt the overall standards and requirements of any scheme. However, in adopting the standards and requirements for the scheme, it was also noted that it should not be necessary to duplicate existing regulatory mechanisms, nor would it be desirable to create an overly complex and bureaucratic scheme.  For example, it was suggested that only standards relevant to the operations in the Antarctic should be part of the scheme.

6.  Two participants suggested that an Antarctic Tourism Accreditation Scheme should be legally binding and mandatory.  Whilst the majority of existing tour operators are based in Treaty Parties, however, it would not be possible to bind operators from non-Treaty States in this way.  Existing Accreditation Schemes are also normally voluntary – with mandatory requirements being enacted into legislation.  One of the aims of an Accreditation Scheme was to provide consistency of requirements, which it was noted was not always the case through the implementation of domestic legislation.

7.  The engagement of the tourism industry (and operators of other human activities in Antarctica) was considered to be vital for the success of any scheme.  It was also recognised that IAATO are already working on developing their own scheme and it was important that the initiatives be inter-linked.  It was suggested that in the short-term, one option would be for the ATCM to focus only on compliance with existing legal requirements and see industry accreditation as a “Rolls Royce” stamp.

Discussion Question: Should the accreditation framework require evidence directly from tourism operators that the existing legal obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System for managing tourism are being complied with, or should there just be a requirement that the appropriate domestic legislation has been complied with?

8.  Whilst it was generally agreed that the scheme needed to include evidence that the existing legal requirements under the Antarctic Treaty System were being complied with, it was noted that domestic legislation can differ from Party to Party. It was also highlighted that some Parties do not yet have relevant domestic legislation.  It would be important to ensure that the relevant Party assessed compliance with domestic legislation and that the Accreditation Scheme should not seek to duplicate this process, or conflict in anyway with domestic legislation.  Delivering consistency was to be a main aim of the scheme, so the Accreditation Scheme would need to have specific criteria, timelines and funding allocated to it.

Discussion Question: To what extent should the list of issues identified in the earlier ICG discussions, where additional regulations may be desirable, be addressed through an Accreditation Scheme?

9.  It was suggested that the ATCM should give further consideration to whether some, or all, of the issues previously identified could be addressed through an Accreditation Scheme.  Such consideration would need to determine which issues could be addressed by Measures, Decisions or Resolutions and which where covered by other legal instruments.  Another approach would be to ask the accreditation body, once established, to consider this.

Discussion Question: How would the information collected as part of the Accreditation Scheme be utilised?  Would it just be used by the accrediting body to ensure delivery of agreed standards, or could all information collected be accessible by all Parties and made available to support the day-to-day management of Antarctic Tourism, such as is undertaken by IAATO?

10.  It was felt that further consideration on this issue should be given after the outline of the scheme had been determined.  There was in principle support for transparency and openness, but commercial, privacy and liability issues required further consideration.

D. Potential impact on Parties:

Discussion Question: Once the ATCM has defined the standards for the Accreditation Scheme (either as a bespoke scheme, or as an extension to an existing accreditation mechanism), what further engagement should the ATCM expect to have in the scheme?

11.  It was agreed by the participants that the ATCM would have an ongoing role in any Accreditation Scheme, for example, to define and approve the standards; oversee, monitor and review the scheme; and to give the accreditation body a very clear mandate.  It was also proposed that the Secretariat could maintain a website to include information and record accreditations.

Discussion Question: What role should individual Parties have in the accreditation process?

12.  It was suggested that Parties would be responsible for ensuring that tour operators participated in the scheme and that Parties should implement the scheme and ensure that it is compatible with domestic legislation.  However, should the scheme be based on existing international accreditation models, then the detailed standards would not necessarily be enshrined in domestic legislation.  Under this scenario, the role of Parties would be more about supporting the scheme and taking measures to encourage uptake. (For example, this could include restricting access to facilities in Antarctica, encouraging nationals to only travel with accredited companies, or amending existing legislation to only “permit” accredited companies to travel to and operate in Antarctica).

13.  It was acknowledged that Parties could be involved in on-site audits or inspections of tour companies’ operations in Antarctica.  Inspections were already possible under Article VII of the Treaty and the inspection and observer system of CCAMLR was suggested as a model.  The question of sanctions or enforcement action was also raised – particularly if the adopted model relied on domestic legislation.




ICG on Accreditation of Antarctic Tourism
January 2005

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED ON THIRD ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS

Key Aims: Develop a framework for implementation of an Accreditation Scheme and agree scope. Consider overall costs involved in implementation and identify options for financing.
Agree options for the establishment or endorsement of standards to underpin the scheme.

1.  Comments were received from Germany; France; New Zealand; Ukraine; Uruguay and ASOC.  UK comments were included in the summaries below.


E. Framework for implementation of an Accreditation Scheme and scope; Options for the establishment or endorsement of standards to underpin the scheme:

2.  There was not consensus among the ICG on the overall framework, scope or mechanism of an ATCM-led Accreditation Scheme.  Furthermore, it was also clear that participants did not have a common understanding of the term "accreditation".  One participant set out three potential models that could be used:
    • voluntary scheme, potentially along the lines already developed by IAATO – advantage would be that this scheme could encompass all tour operators – including from non-Treaty Parties; disadvantages include that such a scheme in itself would not necessarily enhance exiting standards (though it should be noted that IAATO requirements are more than just ATCM adopted standards);
    • combination of Accreditation Scheme and national procedures, thus substituting national procedures with an international scheme – advantages include ensuring consistency of standards and including Parties that do not currently have national legislation; disadvantages include conflicts with national systems and domestic legislation and the potential capacity of any central body;
    • mandatory Accreditation Scheme to work in parallel with existing national requirements – advantages include the collation of all requirements in one place and potentially ensuring consistency of standards; disadvantages include potential conflicts between different national requirements, particularly where no domestic legislation exists and time pressures between national processes and international accreditation.

2.  Further discussion would be needed to clarify which, if any, of these three possible approaches could be developed further.  During the time available for the ICG, the only general agreement was that any scheme should not be overly complex or bureaucratic and that a step-by-step approach would be the best way forward.  Such an approach would enable existing standards to be included in an Accreditation Scheme swiftly and others added, as they are agreed by the ATCM.  This would also provide flexibility to respond to any future changes in the nature of Antarctic Tourism.

3.  Several participants suggested that any Accreditation Scheme should be mandatory and that the first step would be to adopt a Measure, setting out a checklist of minimum standards and requirements (by recalling existing obligations (though noting that the majority are currently non-mandatory) and identifying any new requirements).  Others, however, were of the view that a mandatory requirement would be more akin to regulation rather than accreditation, and would create inflexibility, increase bureaucracy and restrict the scope of the accreditation process to only those tour operators based within Treaty Parties.  

4.  One participant had proposed a model for accreditation, which was considered by the ICG.  There was not, however, consensus on this model.  In particular, there was not agreement on the level of involvement in the scheme by the tourism industry, although it was acknowledged that IAATO would need to be a key partner to any Accreditation Scheme.  There was also a suggestion that it may be premature to consider establishing an accreditation body until the mandatory requirements of the ATCM were clarified.  Instead, an implementation and guidance body could be established to support compliance with ATCM regulations.  

5.  In summary, there was no clear consensus that a new Accreditation Scheme was in fact needed, particularly given the work being undertaken by IAATO.  Instead, further thought should be given to identifying the real problems (such as small yachts and new types of tourism activities) and then looking at what can be done to address these specific issues.


F. Overall costs involved in implementation and options for financing

6.  Given the lack of consensus on whether an Accreditation Scheme should even be established, and if so, what form it should take, there were few exchanges on costings.  It was, however, proposed by most participants that tourist operators, through passenger levies, should finance any scheme.  One participant suggested that the expenses for an accreditation scheme might be economised by giving the responsibility for on-site audits to researchers from national Antarctic programmes, which could use IAATO’s vessels in parallel to their own research programmes and visit tourist sites.
