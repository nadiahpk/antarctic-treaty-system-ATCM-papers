Resolution XXX (2005)

Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programs in Antarctica

The Representatives,

Conscious that there has been an increased focus on the need for environmental monitoring among national Antarctic programs;

Noting the need of having standardized techniques to develop monitoring programs which are scientifically sound, practical and cost effective;

Noting also the need of a proper methodology to be followed when designing a monitoring program;

Considering that a unified approach to environmental monitoring will contribute to the continued protection of the Antarctic environment;

Recommend that:

The Practical Guidelines for Developing and Designing Environmental Monitoring Programs in Antarctica appended to this Resolution be made available for use by those engaged in the preparation of monitoring Programs in Antarctica;

These guidelines be used in conjunction with the COMNAP/SCAR Antarctic Environmental Handbook.
