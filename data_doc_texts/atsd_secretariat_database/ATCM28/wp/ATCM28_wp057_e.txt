Consultative Status

Consultative Status

Background

Article 22 (4) of the Environmental Protocol indicates that:

"After the date on which this Protocol has entered into force, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties shall not act upon a notification regarding the entitlement of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty to appoint representatives to participate in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings in accordance with Article IX (2) of the Antarctic Treaty unless the Contracting Party has first ratified, accepted, approved or acceded to the Protocol".

Subsequently, procedures relating to a notification by a State in respect of Consultative status were amended in 1997 by means of Decision 2 adopted at ATCM XXI.

There is, in the view of the UK, a possible ambiguity as to the requirements for Consultative status in relation to ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the Protocol.  It might, for example, be inferred that Article 22 (4) relates only to the Protocol and its Annexes I - IV.  However, Article 9 of the Protocol states that:

Article 9 (1) "The Annexes to this Protocol shall form an integral part thereof", whilst,

Article 9 (2) indicates that: "Annexes, additional to Annexes I - IV, may be adopted and become effective in accordance with Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty".

Proposal

The UK is of the view that Consultative status should not be conferred on any State unless it has not only ratified, accepted, approved or acceded to the Protocol as originally adopted with its Annexes I - IV, but has also approved under the procedure of Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty, all other Annexes to the Protocol adopted subsequently by means of a measure and which have become effective (i.e. entered into force) under Article IX.

The UK believes this understanding should be reflected either in a modification to Decision 2 (1997), or a new Decision which would supersede it.
