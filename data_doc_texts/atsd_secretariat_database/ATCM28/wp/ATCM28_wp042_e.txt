ANTARCTIC PROTECTED AREAS SYSTEM:
REVISED MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR:

Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 101 Taylor Rookery, Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica,
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 102 Rookery Islands, Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica, and
Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 103 Ardery Island and Odbert Island, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica

Consistent with Resolution 1 (1998) of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXII, Australia has revised the Management Plans for:

    • Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 101 Taylor Rookery, Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica,
    • Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 102 Rookery Islands, Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica, and
    • Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 103 Ardery Island and Odbert Island, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica.

The Plans have been reformatted to accord with the Guide to the Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, appended to resolution 2 (1998) of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting XXII and the requirements of Annex V to the Madrid Protocol.

There have been no substantial changes to the provisions of the existing Management Plans, although the new format has required some sections of the Plans to be enhanced. A restricted area has been introduced to the Rookey Islands Antarctic Specially Protected Area to provide for enhanced protection of southern giant petrel nesting sites on Giganteus Island. The ongoing protection of the Areas is warranted.

It is recommended that Parties adopt the revised Management Plans. A draft Measure to this effect is attached.
