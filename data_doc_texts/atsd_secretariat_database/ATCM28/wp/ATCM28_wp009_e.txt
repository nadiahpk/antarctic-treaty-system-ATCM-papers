The Committee on Environmental Protection of the Antarctic Treaty: An overview and likely future scenarios
THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY: AN OVERVIEW AND LIKELY FUTURE SCENARIOS 


Introduction
During CEP VII (Capetown, 2004), Sweden made the observation that the work of the CEP had evolved from its initial formative phase and the Committee now found itself at a new stage with possibilities for further substantial developments. This initiative was supported by several Members of the Committee. 
In parallel with such an initiative, this paper provides an overview of the main issues that the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) of the Antarctic Treaty, has dealt with during its first seven years of operation, and it proposes future scenarios for the CEP by underlining major challenges and opportunities for the short and medium term. The goal of this paper is to serve as a starting point to initiate a strategic discussion, based on earlier results from the CEP, which could open up for a review of responsibilities and work tasks for the Committee. 

Issues considered (1998-2004)
An analysis of the work conducted by the CEP in the period 1998-2004 indicates that its members mainly focused on issues connected to Annexes I, II and V: more than 75% of all Working Papers presented to the seven CEP Meetings so far deal with these issues.  The importance of these issues is underlined by the  more than 60% of the paragraphs of the CEP Final Reports which have reported their discussion. The lesser attention given to Annex III and IV issues might imply that, at least for the time being, implementation of national (and other international) procedures on these issues has proved  to be adequate. Regarding the remaining agenda items, they followed a similar path than Annex III and IV, largely because these issues have been either discussed in more detail by the ATCM itself and by COMNAP (“Environmental Monitoring”, “Emergency response”, “Data and Information Exchange”) or have only recently been incorporated into the CEP agenda (“Cooperation with other organizations” at CEP IV, and “Bioprospecting” at CEP VI). 

The following table shows the number of Information Papers and Working Papers submitted to the CEP, between 1998 and 2004, by agenda item.

The high number of IPs under “Compliance with Madrid Protocol” is associated to the Annual reports submitted under Article 17 of the Protocol; while the high number of WPs under “Matters covered by Annex V” is due to the requirement for revised Management Plans for existing protected area, and proposals for the designation of new ones have to be submitted in WPs. 

Achievements
a) Since its inception the CEP has referred a high number of issues to the ATCM, originating almost 50% of the Measures/Resolutions/Decisions agreed by it (15 Measures, 12 Resolutions and 5 Decisions). That is to say, since 1998, a little less than half of the provisions regulating human activities in Antarctica have directly stemmed from the work of the CEP. 
b) The CEP has provided Antarctic operators with practical environmental management tools, such as the Guidelines for the preparation of Management plans for ASPAs  (CEP I, Tromsø, 1998); for EIA in Antarctica (CEP II, Lima, 1999); for considering new and revised draft management plans for protected areas (CEP III, The Hague, 2000); for the implementation of the framework for Protected Areas set forth in Article 3, Annex V of the Environmental Protocol (CEP III, The Hague, 2000); for handling of pre-1958 historic remains whose existence or present location has not been established (CEP IV, St. Petersburg, 2001); and the Guidelines for the operation of aircraft near bird colonies in Antarctica (CEP VII, Capetown, 2004).
c) The CEP has reacted to problems rapidly and flexibly, adapting its meeting procedures as required, either by incorporating new items to its agenda (the addition of “Bioprospecting”, in 2003, for instance), by submitting specific questions to the ATCM, seeking advice or support (see Resolution 3, 2001, on the need to protect Antarctic meteorites from unrestricted collection), or by modifying its own rules of procedure (see Decision 2, 2001 in relation to Circulation and Handling of CEP documents).  The CEP has also used workshops to address particular issues: the second Workshop on Antarctic Protected Areas (Lima, 1999), for instance, arose from a CEP recommendation.  
d) The CEP has promoted international exchange and cooperation, for example through the submission of joint WP or IP by two or more Parties. Similarly there has been a growing bilateral exchange of environmental officers from National Antarctic Programs, and even joint Antarctic expeditions with purely environmental purposes. 
e) Links with organizations such as SCAR, COMNAP and CCAMLR have been strengthened throughout these 7 years. The CEP has consistently consulted these organisations on their areas of expertise, and they in turn have responded with valuable contributions to CEP discussions. SCAR and COMNAP have contributed more than 30 WP and IP to CEP meetings. 
f) The CEP has seized recent advances in technology, especially those associated with the Internet, and incorporated them into its routine. The CEP web site, the e-mail based-work of Inter-sessional Contact Groups, and the web-based forums are only some examples of it. 

Current and likely future scenarios 
a) One of the main challenges facing the CEP is the growing size and complexity of its meeting workload: while CEP I dealt with 12 Working Papers and reported its discussions in 61 paragraphs of the Final report; CEP VII considered 26 working papers  and required 209 paragraphs in the Final Report. Although the CEP has increasingly used ICG to improve the efficiency of its meetings, it is increasingly apparent that its workload will nonetheless soon exceed its five-day meeting capacity. If the plenary meeting of the CEP is to remain limited to five days, then new alternatives will have to be sought to accommodate longer discussions.  The recent establishment of web-based forums to coordinate discussion of new or revised Protected Areas’ Management Plans has attempted to address this issue. Furthermore, the presentation of IPs has been reduced to at most a cursory introduction by proponent Parties: this may require further reduction so that meeting time can be more profitably devoted to issues presented in WPs.  
b) Another long-term difficulty is related to the Parties’ participation in discussion: historically only a small number of Parties and Observers have presented issues for consideration. For example: only 8 Parties and SCAR-COMNAP (less than a third of CEP participants) account for more than 80% of all the WPs ever presented to the CEP. In addition, as seen in the following table, nine Parties have never presented a WP to the Meeting, and other nine have only contributed a maximum of five WPs.

* The total number of parties differs, since WP may only be presented by Consultative parties.
There has been, however, a growing number of Information papers presented by Parties to recent CEP meetings, although almost 40% of them are Annual reports submitted under Article 17 of the Protocol1, a methodology that is becoming unnecessary since the establishment of an Information Exchange database in 2003 (available at www.ats.org.ar). Although it is worth mentioning that this analysis is exclusively based on numerical information, it seems also true that if the CEP is to be a truly representative body, as intended by the Protocol, a more active presence by its Members might therefore be encouraged. 
c) As the CEP is required to be the technical advisory body on the implementation of the Protocol within the ATS, it is required by Article 11 of the Protocol to ensure, at the maximum extent possible, that its members have scientific, technical and/or environmental management backgrounds. Antarctic experience would be convenient as well, to ensure that the CEP’s recommendations take appropriate account of implementation practicalities. Parties have a major challenge in this respect: it may be that the structure of Antarctic programs could benefit from more closely emulating the ATS  structure, or attaining sufficient flexibility to rapidly adjust to new situations and provide the CEP with the most adequate and current knowledge and advice. 
d) ATCM XXV (Warsaw, 2002) set the review of annexes to the Protocol as an immediate priority for the CEP, commencing with Annex II.. The Committee’s final report was presented at ATCM XXVII, but the ATCM has not yet completed its consideration. Noting the unprecedented number of participants and the breadth of discussions in the intersessional and plenary work during the Annex II review, it may be expected that the issue of further reviews will be re-addressed in the short to medium term. Annex I and Annex V seem to be the most likely candidates for future reviews, since extensive work has already been done on them in the form of interpretative Guidelines, which could be incorporated into new texts. New scientific data on issues such as species conservation and bioprospecting may also trigger proposals to adjust the annexes. 
e) Future challenges include the incorporation of new issues into the Committee’s work, among them the environmental aspects connected to Tourism and the Liability issue. At CEP VII, some aspects of Antarctic tourist activities were specifically addressed, and an ICG was commissioned to report on the suitability to the current broad range of Antarctic activities of the CEP Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (1999). The matter of Liability would also have to be incorporated in the CEP agenda, in case a new annex to the Protocol on this issue was agreed and adopted in the near future.  
f) Lastly, the CEP will, over the next several years, have to mesh its processes, archives and data-bases with those of the recently established Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, and possibly other ATS bodies.

Conclusion
After seven years of work the CEP has consolidated itself as the prime advisory body on environmental matters within the Antarctic Treaty system. It has achieved this by a combination of strategies and activities: creating, implementing and adjusting its own procedures; identifying problematic matters within the Protocol; exercising flexibility in addressing new issues; producing practical tools for environmental management and protection; exploiting the efficiencies of electronic communication through the World Wide Web and the Internet; and reinforcing other organizations with positive feedback. 
The future will bring new challenges and opportunities. In rising to them, the CEP will draw on its growing strengths as the most representative and respected Antarctic institution safeguarding the Antarctic environment, which, alongside the maintenance of peace and the freedom of scientific research is one of the three pillars of the Antarctic Treaty . The responsibility and challenge lie with Antarctic Treaty Parties to ensure that the work of the CEP continues to foster the spirit and principles of Antarctic cooperation, and that it remains productively focused on the protection of the Antarctic environment and the environmental principles of the Madrid Protocol.
