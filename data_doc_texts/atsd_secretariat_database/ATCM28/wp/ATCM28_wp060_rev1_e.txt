Decision XXX (2005)

Use of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in Antarctica

The Representatives: 

Recalling Article 3 of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty which requires that activities in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be planned and conducted so as to limit adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment,
Recalling also the requirements of Annex IV of the Environmental Protocol on Prevention of Marine Pollution, 
Aware of the potential for adverse impact which a release of Heavy Fuel Oil HFO could have on the Antarctic marine environment, 
Considering that the International Maritime Organization is the competent organization to deal with shipping regulations,

Decide to:

Address a request through the Chair of ATCM XXVIII to the International Maritime Organization to examine mechanisms for restricting the use of Heavy Fuel Oil (defining HFO in accordance to MARPOL Regulation 13 H definition of Heavy Grade Oil as all fuels of higher grade than Intermediate Fuel Oil 180 (IFO-180)) in Antarctic waters, taking into account:

    • the relatively high risk of fuel release in the Antarctic Treaty area due to conditions such as icebergs, sea-ice, and uncharted waters; and
    • the high potential of environmental impacts associated with a spill and emission of HFO in the Antarctic Treaty area.
