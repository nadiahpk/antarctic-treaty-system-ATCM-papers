External AUDIT of the antarctic treaty Secretariat

External Audit of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat

1. Regulation 11 of the Financial Regulations of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat attached to Decision 4 (2003) states that:

“The ATCM shall appoint an external auditor who shall be the Auditor-General, or equivalent statutory authority from a Consultative Party of the ATCM, and shall serve for a term of two years with the possibility of re-appointment. The ATCM will ensure the external auditor’s independence from the Secretariat and the Secretariat’s staff.  The ATCM shall establish the terms of office, allocate appropriate funds to the external auditor and may consult him/her on the introduction or amendment of any financial regulations or detailed accounting methods, as well as on all matters affecting auditing procedures and methodology.”

2. Working Paper ATCM XXVIII/WP044, presented by the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, a report on the activities of the Secretariat from 1 September 2004 to 31 March 2005, states that “The Financial Report has not yet been audited, since the ATCM has not yet appointed the External Auditor.”  

3. Argentina has prepared this Working Paper for consideration by the Consultative Parties. It contains relevant information on the Sindicatura General de la Nación (SIGEN), or the Comptroller’s Office, which is responsible for the internal controls of the national Executive Power. This agency has drafted a proposal to conduct an external audit of the Secretariat and eventually to provide consulting services on management and oversight as outlined below.

4.  SIGEN’s responsibilities are: 

    • to develop and implement internal oversight regulations; 
    • to issue internal audit regulations and oversee their implementation by the relevant units;
    • to conduct or coordinate financial audits, legal and management audits, and special investigations; to provide expert opinions on financial and other issues, as well as guidance for program, project, and operation assessments;
    • to oversee the operation of the internal controls system; 
    • to establish technical quality requirements for the staff of internal audit units; 
    • to approve the annual working plans of the internal audit units, and to guide and oversee their implementation and outcomes; and
    • to ensure the realization, by the audited agencies, of the observations and recommendations made by the internal audit units and agreed to by the relevant officers.

SIGEN employs more than 400 agents with experience in audits and controls. Some are members of the Argentine Institute of Internal Auditors. SIGEN has been certified as an Internal Auditor by The Institute of Internal Auditors (USA).

5. SIGEN’s proposal covers the period from June 2005 to May 2007 and includes the following tasks:

1. 	Preliminary assessment of the Secretariat’s legal status, as well as its operational context, operational rules, infrastructure, assets, computer equipment, and information. 
2. 	Detailed assessment and evaluation of the Secretariat’s activities, including legal, administrative, and information technology issues.
3. 	Analysis of the current strengths and opportunities provided by the Secretariat’s activities.
4. 	Elaboration of a draft report.
5. 	Elaboration of an external audit report covering the financial years ending in 2005 and 2006, in accordance with Article 11.3 of Decision 4 (2003).
6. 	Definition, establishment, and oversight of specific due diligence procedures.
7. 	To promote transparency of management by providing technical assistance for procurement processes, including, at the Secretariat’s request, pricing information and drafting of bidding specifications for consultants, and, in general, requests for proposals.  
8. 	Technical assistance in the area of management and oversight, in response to the Secretariat’s requests for advice.

The activities to be carried out can be grouped into three categories: accounting, information technology, and legal issues.

LEGAL ISSUES

- To determine if the Secretariat’s activities are covered by the current regulations, particularly Measure 1 (2003), the Headquarters Agreement, Decision 3 (2003) on “Staff Regulations” and Decision 4 (2003) on “Financial Regulations”.

- To determine if the work carried out thus far supports the objectives and mission of the Secretariat, pursuant to the work and objectives of the ATCM.

- To oversee administrative performance and operations, stressing compliance with deadlines, reporting levels (receiving and providing information), and quality of information contents.

SIGEN’s activities in the Secretariat will be carried out by a team consisting of a project coordinator and auditors specialized in accounting, information technology, and legal issues.

The external audit of the partial financial year 2004/2005 and the current financial year will require a total of 720 men/hours, whereas a total of 600 men/hours will be required for subsequent financial years.

The cost of the work proposed by SIGEN is:

Annual external audit-----------------------------------US$ 6.532
Consulting and technical assistance services---------US$ 4.930

The Secretariat and SIGEN would enter into a service contract in order to formalize the activities included in the Secretariat’s external audit.

6. Without prejudice of the views that the Consultative Parties may have in this regard, Argentina submits this working paper to the ATCM for consideration, with the understanding that, in principle, for practical reasons (location of the activity, familiarity with local laws, etc.), it might be useful for SIGEN to take on the responsibility for the Secretariat’s external audit, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 11 of the Financial Regulations and other related rules, and within the terms of reference that the ATCM may establish.
