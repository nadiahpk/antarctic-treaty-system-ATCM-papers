Progress report of the CEP Intersessional Contact Group on Environmental Monitoring


Progress report of the CEP Intersessional Contact Groupon Environmental Monitoring


During the VII CEP Meeting (Cape Town, 2004), the Committee discussed the environmental monitoring requirements associated to human activities in Antarctica on the basis of several documents (WP004, WP011, IP030, IP038). Previously, the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts (ATME), which convened in March 2004 in Norway (WP004), stressed that Committee for Environmental Protection should address the issue of monitoring and provide the ATCM with recommendations for the coordinated monitoring of activities in Antarctica including the establishment of a consistent methodology and central data collection process. 

The Committee agreed to establish an ICG, including experts from Parties, SCAR, CCAMLR, IAATO and ASOC, to examine the issue of environmental monitoring in Antarctica, taking into account previous work by CEP/ATCM and COMNAP on environmental monitoring in Antarctica. 

Terms of references of the ICG 

    1. consider which environmental variables are the best indicators of the assessment of the impacts of human activities in Antarctica, in particular on populations, habitats and other sensitive areas directly, indirectly or cumulatively impacted
    2. identify appropriate methodologies for monitoring these indicators
    3. identify existing data sets relevant to the indicators
    4. develop guidelines on appropriate environmental monitoring that are simple and effective, and can be undertaken by national programs and/or NGOs 
    5. consider data management including availability through the pilot SAER system, or the Secretariat, and 
    6. provide a report to CEP VIII

The ICG is coordinated by Dr Yves Frenot, from France. 13 Parties (Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, New-Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Ukrainia, USA), and 3 NGOs (ASOC, IAATO, Oceanites) have participated, so far, to the discussions. 

This paper details the outcomes of the ICG for the first intersessional period, for the consideration to the Committee.


Methodology

The ICG operates in accordance with the Guidelines for such open-ended informal contact groups as set out in CEPI Final Report paragraph 9.

Two documents were sent initially to all the CEP contact points: 

1) a proposed workplan including an agenda and a suggested strategy to address the three first issues of the Terms of reference and 

2) a “state of the art” with the following issues:
    • a series of useful definitions provided by COMNAP/AEON (2004) [Practical guidelines for developing and designing environmental monitoring programs in Antarctica],
    • a survey of the recent bibliography on the environmental monitoring in Antarctica including a brief synthesis of the following papers:

First round of discussions
The ICG members agreed with the workplan and the proposed strategy and a first round of discussions occurred on the basis of the “state of the art” document to achieve an agreement on the definitions of terms (appendix 1) and to assess the desired characteristics of indicators (appendix 2) and methodology (appendix 3) to monitor these indicators.

Second round of discussion
According to the conclusions of the first round of discussions, a second round started in February to address the best indicators of the assessment of the impacts of human activities in Antarctica, the methodologies for monitoring these indicators, and the existing data sets relevant to the indicators. It was suggested to use the following issues: 
    1. to identify the types of human activities (nature, scope, and concentration ) which may negatively affect the antarctic environment 
    2. to identify the components of the antarctic ecosystems which may be affected by these activities, with distinction between direct, indirect or cumulative impacts.
    3. For each type of human activities and potential impacts, to identify the best biological and/or environmental variables  which can be used as indicator 
    4. to provide the appropriate methodology for monitoring each of the variables identified at the previous stage; at this stage, it would be interesting to know what kind of book, manual or other documents could be helpful (for example the Environmental Monitoring Handbook SCAR/COMNAP, the RiSCC manual SCAR…)
    5. to provide information on the existing data sets relevant to these indicators (this last step would update the COMNAP AEON document “Summary of Environmental Monitoring Activities in Antarctica”, last version in October 2004).


Summary of the discussions

First round of discussions

1) Agreement on the definitions

All the respondents agreed with the definitions proposed by COMNAP/AEON (2004) and listed in Appendix 1. They are also used in the EIA-context.

Some definitions could be formulated more precisely, especially when the term “environment” is used without other precision. Definitions of environment from different sources have been provided. Each of them includes biological components:
-The sum of all external conditions affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism (Source: Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, 1990).
 www.globalchange.org/glossall/glossd-f.htm 
-The complex set of physical, geographic, biological, social, cultural and political conditions that surround an individual or organism and that ultimately determines its form and nature of its survival. www.worldbank.org/html/schools/glossary.htm 
- The sum total of all the external conditions that effect an organism, community, material, or energy. www.weather.com/glossary/e.html 
- the aggregate of all the external conditions and influences affecting the life, development, and ultimately the survival of an organism. More commonly, the earth's crust, water resources, life forms, and atmosphere. www.baaqmd.gov/pie/aqgloss.htm 
- An external condition or the sum of such conditions, in which a piece of equipment, a living organism, or a system operates as in temperature environment, vibration environment or space environment. vesuvius.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/e.html 
- The totality of the surrounding external conditions--biological, chemical, and physical--within which an organism, community, or object exists. The term is not exclusive in that organisms can be and usually are part of another organism's environment. Thus one can speak of the environment as that within which humankind lives, i.e., separate and external; or, one can speak of humankind as a component of the environment. www.cnie.org/nle/AgGlossary/letter-e.html 
- Surroundings in which an organization operates, including air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, humans, and their interrelations. This definition extends the view from a company focus to the global system. www.gdrc.org/uem/ait-terms.html

One participant remarked that biological monitoring is the standardized measurement and observation of a biological specimen for the presence of a change, or other response, as a result of exposure to an environmental feature. The definition may be contrasted with environmental monitoring that uses the surrounding environmental elements as the sampled medium (air, water, soil). Since environmental monitoring leads to estimates of external exposure while biological monitoring permits estimates of internal absorbed dose or biological response, the two types of monitoring are complementary: their results should be correlated, but their interpretations generally are different.

Another participant emphasized that data management, including collection, quality assessment and reporting constitute an integral part of the definition of monitoring.  

Concerning the crucial term of “indicator” it was suggested to refer to the OECD definition:  a parameter or a value derived from parameters, which points to, provide information about, describes the state of a phenomenon / environment / area, with a significance extending beyond that directly associated with a parameter value. 

It was also suggested to use the terms pressure and response to replace output and compliance, respectively, in the definition of “indirect indicator”, because these two terms are generally accepted in the “world of monitoring systems”. 

One respondent suggested to add the notion of scarcity in the definition of value.

Some terms used in the TOR of ICG are not defined by COMNAP/AEON report, and the following additional definitions have been proposed:
• Habitat: the environment in which a population or individual lives; includes not only the place where a species is found, but also the particular characteristics of the place (e.g., climate or the availability of suitable food and shelter) that make it especially well suited to meet the life cycle needs of that species.
• Population: a group of organisms of one species occupying a defined area and usually isolated geographically or otherwise to some degree from other similar groups.
• Sensitive areas: natural habitats that have a high level of vulnerability


2) Assessment of the desired characteristics of indicators 

This second section concerned the desired characteristics of indicators used in environmental monitoring in Antarctica, on the basis of the SCAR / COMNAP document (1996) (see Appendix 2)

Most of the members recognized that all the criteria listed in Appendix 2 are desirable but some of these criteria have been pointed out, as being “more important” in the context of environmental monitoring in Antarctica:
    1. Be known or measurable above natural variability (i.e. background levels); 
    2. Give information from which management decisions can be made; 
    3. Be able to sustain the monitoring activity; 
    4. Be able to be sampled within logistical and time constraints; 
    5. Exhibit changes in excess of limits of detection; 
    6. Be directly relatable to a testable hypothesis; 
    7. Be amenable to quality assurance procedures including demonstrable precision, accuracy and reproducibility. 
    8. Be measurable on samples that can be transported without deterioration or be measurable on-site in the field; 
    9. Be measurable by cost effective, simple and standard procedures (if the procedures are non-standard intercalibrations are essential).

Most of the respondents considered that these characteristics are not only desirable but also realistic in the “antarctic context”.  However, several Parties recognized that logistical, time and financial constraints vary among the programmes and operators and could affect the level of monitoring. Nevertheless, one participant suggested that we should be setting a general standard that can be aimed for but also provide guidance on where changes could be made if necessary without compromising the results of monitoring.


3) Assessment of methodology to monitor the indicators

The third section discussed the main tenets for the design of monitoring programs on the basis of the SCAR / COMNAP document (1996) Monitoring of environmental impacts from science and operations in Antarctic (see Appendix 3).

All the members agreed that the list provided in Appendix 3 remains a good guide to the key elements and steps in establishing a monitoring programme. One participant noted that to have replicates randomly allocated could be problematic from a logistical point of view regarding biological indicators (and perhaps other indicators as well).

As for the previous issue, members were invited to sort the 10 tenets by order of importance. Whereas two ICG members considered that all the 10 tenets listed are equally important, the others identified 3 major tenets:

    1. Have a clear question. The thought process should be: question  hypothesis  indicators  parameters  model  statistics and tests of hypothesis  interpretation. 
    2. Assess the sampling methods to ensure they are efficient and do not introduce bias into the study. Adequate quality assurance must be applied from initial sample collection, through transport to the laboratory, and during the analysis. 
    3. Accept the results, [… ] and don’t try to find statistical methods that give you the result you want. 
Concerning this last point, which is obviously a matter of professional ethic, it was noted that  statistical design should be stressed: this eliminates some of the concern that researchers will seek statistical methods that provide the desired result.


Then, the ICG members were questioned about the generalization of the statement given in Hofmann & Jatko (2002): long-term studies are likely necessary to detect any possible cumulative impacts [of ship-based tourism], and it would be impractical and prohibitively costly to attempt to characterize and monitor every site in the Peninsula area that is or may be subject to visits [by shipborne tourists].  Can this statement be extended to all the human activities in Antarctica? 

According to the Madrid Protocol, all activities in the Antarctic are subject to an Initial Environmental Evaluation before approval, and appropriate procedures, which may include monitoring, are requested to assess and verify the impact of the activity. It means that environmental monitoring has a “compulsory” character. Some monitoring efforts could in fact be implemented at most sites, e.g. simple photo documentation and other similar initiatives. However, several Parties agreed that it is not possible, nor necessary, to monitor everything everywhere. For instance, if an accident or spill occurred at an isolated site on the polar plateau, then monitoring may be appropriate, although monitoring resources may still be best focused in areas where living resources occur. Several Parties stressed the critical importance of being very clear about what the objectives of monitoring are and the need to identify what the priorities should be for monitoring to achieve those objectives.

On another hand, there was a clear agreement with the fact that problems concerning the impracticability and the costs of monitoring every site (for all human activities) should not be used as an argument against implementation of monitoring initiative. 

Several parties also emphasized the need to institute long term monitoring of carefully selected parameters.

	Some Parties expressed their concerns regarding the comparability of different activities in Antarctica, for instance between tourism activities which will be carried out regularly at the same places and geological expeditions which will be organized once in many years at a single place. So, it is questionable whether an intended recommendation could be applicable to the whole range of human activities. 

IAATO expressed his disagreement with the countries who have singled out tourism as a problem and not considered the fact that we should be looking at all human activity not just tourists. IAATO argued that science and field personnel have more resident time in Antarctica than tourists and that stations can have a far greater impact on sites simply due to the infrastructure ashore than tourism.

From this point of view, the convenor of the ICG reminds that, according to the terms of reference, the aim of the ICG is to provide indicators of the assessment of the impacts of all human activities in Antarctica. However, the question of whether different types of human activities produce different impacts and request different monitoring approaches remains valid and is open for discussion. 


Finally, a discussion was established on the possibility to adapt the recommendation made by Hofma & Jatko (2002) (observations at a series of comparable sites along a gradient with different types and levels of tourist activities, and/or observations at a series of comparable sites subjected internationally to different types and levels of tourist activities, are likely necessary to distinguish any cumulative environmental impacts possibly resulting from tourist activities from those caused by other factors) to the whole range of human activities in Antarctica and may serve as a possible basis for further discussion when we assess the TOR of the ICG

Several examples have been provided, showing that such an approach is already developed in Antarctica: lichens are monitored in fixed plots at sites in the Swedish and Finnish stations areas and at sites not normally visited by expeditioners; Australia monitors introduced diseases in Antarctic vertebrates at sites adjacent to and distant from human activity... So, the general sentiment was that these types of observations are recommended. However, one respondent noted that one of the key issues in devising a monitoring programme consistent with the above statement is of course being able to identify comparable sites for monitoring. So often we know so little baseline information about sites and it may be that part way into a programme that comparability issues arise.  


Second round of discussions

Few answers have been received during this second stage of discussions. The reason is probably the huge field of scientific and technical knowledge implicated in the Terms of Reference of the ICG and the very complex arrangement of possible environmental impacts and corresponding monitoring measures. 

Simultaneously to this second period of discussion, a workshop was organized by SCAR, COMNAP and NSF at Bryan / College Station, Texas, March 16-18, on Practical Biological Indicators of Human Impacts in Antarctica. The terms of reference of this workshop were close to those of the present ICG (but exclusively related to biological monitoring). It is planned to use the workshop report as an Information Paper for discussion at the next CEP meeting at Stockholm. Several ICG members have participated in this meeting in Texas and some of them suggested that the input of that workshop should be an important basis for further discussions in the ICG: physical, chemical, and now biological variables have been addressed through the 1996 SCAR/COMNAP workshop report and subsequent Environmental Monitoring Handbook and the recent workshop. 

Considering the difficulty to enable a comprehensive discussion in the short timeframe available with respect to deadlines for submission of Working Paperss to the CEP/ATCM, and according to the necessity to take advantage of the very valuable input of this recent SCAR / COMNAP / NSF workshop, the convenor of the ICG suggested to suspend the 2nd round of discussion. This suggestion received the agreement of all the respondents. Several parties supported also the idea that the ICG members should continue to consider the issue in the forthcoming months in order to not delay the ICG work after the next CEP meeting.


Conclusion

Over the first intersessional period, the ICG has been able to achieve the following tasks:

- review of the main previous works by CEP/ATCM and SCAR, COMNAP on environmental monitoring
- agreement on the definitions of terms used during the discussions
- agreement on the desired characteristics of indicators
- agreement on the main tenets for the design of monitoring programs
- discussion on the difficulty to monitor every sites with human activities in Antarctica
- discussion on the necessity to compare the impacts of human activities in contrasted situations

It appears that the 3 first terms of reference of the ICG are difficult to assess without the contribution of the recent SCAR / COMNAP / NSF workshop on Biological Monitoring which will provide a sound basis to make progress in these issues. The CEP VIII meeting at Stockholm will provide an opportunity to discuss the integration of the workshop results into the ICG work. Some Parties wish also that the framework of “Environmental Monitoring” should be defined more clearly when the new Terms of Reference will be define for the continuation of the work. 


In conclusion, ICG considers that it is necessary to prolong its work for another intersessional period in order to produce a final report at the 2006 CEP meeting. We hope that the CEP will agree with this request and will mandate the ICG to continue its work.
 
Appendix 1
Glossary of terms used in the environmental monitoring context in Antarctica elaborated by COMNAP/AEON (2004) [Practical guidelines for developing and designing environmental monitoring programs in Antarctica]

Action: Any step taken as part of an activity.
Activity: An event or process resulting from, or associated with, the presence of humans in Antarctica, and/or which may lead to the presence of humans in Antarctica.
Cumulative Impact: The combined impact of past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities. These activities may occur over time and space and can be additive, interactive or synergistic.
Direct Impact: A change in environmental components that results from direct cause-effect consequences of interaction between the exposed environment and outputs.
Exposure: The process of interaction between an identified potential output and an environmental element or value.
Impact: A change in the values or resources attributable to a human activity. It is the consequence of an agent of change, not the agent itself.
Indicator: Signs or symptoms of changes, potentially due to numerous factors, in an environmental feature or features.
Indirect indicator: Signs or symptoms of changes in features not directly related to the environmental feature, but which potentially may impact the environmental features. Output indicators indicate changes in outputs (emission, fuel spills, noise) that may impact the environment. Compliance indicators indicate changes in compliance with environmental legislation, which then indirectly may have consequences for the environment.
Indirect Impact: A change in environmental components that results from interactions between the environment and other impacts (direct or indirect).
Mitigation: The use of practice, procedure or technology to minimise or prevent impacts associated with proposed activities.
Monitoring: Consists of standardised measurements or observations of key parameters (outputs and environmental variables) over time, their statistical evaluation and reporting on the state of the environment in order to define quality and trends.
Output: A physical change or an entity imposed on or released to the environment as a result of an action or an activity.
Parameter: A measurable variable for an indicator.
Remediation: The steps taken after impacts have occurred to promote, as much as possible, the return of the environment to its original condition.
Unavoidable Impact: An impact for which no further mitigation is possible.
Value : The worth, merit or importance of something (environmental value : the worth, merit or importance of an environmental feature).


Appendix 2
The SCAR / COMNAP document (1996) Monitoring of environmental impacts from science and operations in Antarctica listed mandatory and desired criteria essential in selecting variables to be monitored.

The following mandatory and desired criteria are essential in selecting variables to be monitored. 
The variables must:
    • Exhibit changes in excess of limits of detection;
    • Be directly relatable to a testable hypothesis;
    • Be known or measurable above natural variability (i.e. background levels);
    • Give information from which management decisions can be made;
    • Be able to sustain the monitoring activity;
    • Be able to be sampled within logistical and time constraints;
    • Be measurable on samples that can be transported without deterioration or be measurable on-site in the field;
    • Be amenable to quality assurance procedures including demonstrable precision, accuracy and reproducibility.
It is also desirable that the parameters:
    • Be measurable by cost effective, simple and standard procedures (if the procedures
    • are non-standard intercalibrations are essential);
    • Be strongly related by what is believed to be a causal link to a particular activity or
    • process;
    • Be a direct measure of change in a value of concern;
    • Permit generalisations about causative agents;
    • Be definable in terms of limits beyond which changes are judged to be deleterious, and
    • Be measurable without conflicting with scientific activities.


Appendix 3
The SCAR / COMNAP document (1996) Monitoring of environmental impacts from science and operations in Antarctica also provided a series of basic tenets for the design of monitoring programs.

    • Have a clear question. The thought process should be: question  hypothesis  indicators  parameters  model  statistics and tests of hypothesis  interpretation.
    • Have controls, both spatial and temporal where appropriate.
    • Have a balanced design, e.g. similar sampling efforts at each impact level and time.
    • Have replicates randomly allocated.
    • Conduct preliminary sampling (pilot study) in order to do the following points.
    • Assess the sampling methods to ensure they are efficient and do not introduce bias into the study. Adequate quality assurance must be applied from initial sample collection, through transport to the laboratory, and during the analysis.
    • Estimate error variability and necessary sampling effort to achieve the desired power.
    • Determine natural environmental patterns to be incorporated into the study design (e.g. stratification).
    • If statistical analysis assumptions are not satisfied (they probably will not be) then transform variable before analysis, use nonparametric methods or use simulation or randomisation methods.
    • Accept the results, [… ] and don’t try to find statistical methods that give you the result you want.
