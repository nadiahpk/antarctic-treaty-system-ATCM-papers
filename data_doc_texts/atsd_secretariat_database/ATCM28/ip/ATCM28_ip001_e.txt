Forward
Interactions and relationships between the sea, land and ice are a very special feature of the geo-ecosystem on the shore of King George Island of the South Shetland archipelago in Maritime Antarctica. Climatic changes in the past, as well as changes that currently occur in this area, influence all these three environments with effects observed in different time scales. Changes on land are more easily recognised than those in the sea. The continuous process of deglaciation is accompanied by succession and colonisation of new areas by bacteria, microflora, lichens, mosses, vascular plants and microfauna. Land areas, with relatively small surfaces, constitute sites of concentration for bird colonies and pinniped resting grounds. As such, they are heavily fertilised and, once colonised, they provide the source of biogens and species claiming new areas freed from underneath the ice. In the sea, the warming climate leads to a decrease of the area covered by fast ice and ice pack and the following decrease in primary production of the sub-glacial flora, which in turn influences the biomass of krill that feeds on the bottom side of the floating ice. Krill is the main food source for animals associated with the land ecosystem, such as flying birds, penguins, fur seals and crabeater seals. Numbers and the biomass of penguins have decreased during the recent years, and so has the amount of organic matter transported to the land. In the shore zone, the smaller surface of pack ice, as well as the shorter time of its existence, eliminate crabeaters and leopard seals whose occurence is dependent on it. Fur seals, migrating from the north towards South Shetland Islands, also depend on krill resources. During the last 30 years of our studies in the Admiralty Bay area, important quantitative changes have occurred, indicating a tendency in the variability of the shore geo-ecosystem. An increase of the air temperature by 0.02o-0.04oC a year, as well as the clearly observed deglaciation in the area, illustrate and prove the case. Our research concerned environmental, i.e. climatic, meteorological, geological, cartographic, geomorphological, paleolimnological, as well as hydrological and  hydrochemical observations, both on land and in the sea, around South Shetland, as well as in  Admiralty Bay and on its shores. This provides a background which allows us to understand changes ocurring in the geo-ecosystem, in the million-year scale of the past, as well as in the decade scale of the present. Biological changes in this part of Maritime Antarctica follow changes of the climate but they are also a result of anthropogenic changes caused by the past and present exploitation of some important parties in the ecosystem, such as fur seals, whales, fish, krill and cephalopods. Changes are also caused by the increasing number of ships and people visiting the region which involves the risk of importing and spreading new species. Our studies concern changes in the numbers, as well as composition of species and populations, their distribution and biomass. All the main groups of sea and land organisms have been recognised, as well as the main trophic levels that they shape, which allowed us to estimate the flow of matter in this coastal-shelf ecosystem of Maritime Antarctica. Our particular attention has been given to DNA and RNA studies, as well as those concerning gene expression among selected systemathic groups, such as: bacteria, vascular plants, sea and land crustaceans, fish and elephant seals. These studies should explain physiological and morphological differences of these organisms, their phylogenetic origin, kinship relations within and outside the Admiralty Bay area, as well as in the whole Western Antarctica and out of it. From taxonomic and systemathic studies in the Admiralty Bay area, which gave us the information on what species, where and in what numbers occur there, through ecological research concerning functional relationships and interactions, we have now turned towards experimental studies. We have initiated research on tropho-chemoreception in invertebrates and fish in the environment characterised by the lowest water temperature. Chemical signals are the key to understand trophic relationships, metabolic changes, behavioural reactions  between predators and prey, as well as formation of benthos communities. 
Our studies in the Admiralty Bay region use the facilities of the Henryk Arctowski station. During the last thirty years, they concerned logically interconnected research areas, coordinated first (from 1977) by the Department of Polar Research of the Institute of Ecology, Polish Academy of Sciences and then (since 1992) by the Department of Antarctic Biology PAS. 
Our research constitutes a good starting point for our contribution to the two main themes: 1 – The current state of the polar environment 2 - Change in the polar regions of the International Polar Year 2007-2008.
