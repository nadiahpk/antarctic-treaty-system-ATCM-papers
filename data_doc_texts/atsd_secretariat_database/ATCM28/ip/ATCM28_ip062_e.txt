2005-2006 Scientific Program Summary
ROMANIAN  ANTARCTIC PROGRAM IN COOPERATION WITH AUSTRALIA

             The Romanian scientific activities in Antarctica in cooperation with Australia and China.    
            The projects are focussing on studies of cryo-pedology, biology, biochemistry, medicine, climatic changes, and determination of pollutants in the waters of the Planetary and mainly the Southern Ocean, in ice, snow, soil, lichens and dead biological material. 

                             Biotical, Enzymic and Chemical Characterization
                                            of East and West Antarctic Soils
                                                               (RO-01)
                                                         Investigators of  
                                            Romanian Polar Research Institute

           Scientific Objectives
          We are studying,  from the pedo-biological point of view, the solidification degree of the terrestrial crust of the Antarctic continent, aiming to put into evidence the solidification processes deepending on the climatic conditions.
           The determination of the accumulation level of the organic matter and the characterization of its quality will provide useful data for the assessment, within the biological research, of the soil micropopulation evolution.
           In a study of pedogenesis of soil samples from King George Island, Larsemann Hills and Grove Mountains, the microflora (bacteria, fungi and algae) will be studied. Using the Indicators of vital and enzymic activities and the Biological Synthetic Indicator, we aim to put into evidence certain potentials of mineralization and biosynthesis, capable of soil forming processes, under Antarctic conditions, that hardly enable the humification of organic material.   
          Even if the soil formation process is practicaly impossible under an adverse climate lasting 9 months per year, with very cold temperatures, inadequate ground and absence of a high vegetal cover, and very low humidity, it is still interesting to study the Antarctic soil evolution. To this purpose in view, we will use the indicators of biotic, enzymic and general biological potentials of the soils, that have been introduced by the Romanian scientist Gh. Ştefanic (1994) as useful tools  for a general comparasion of different biotops.

           Scientific Obiectives
          Microorganism spreading in the most various biotops, their adaptation to extreme micro-climate conditions, as well as the different biosynthesis potentials are arguments for which the soils in Antarctica provide new objectives for the research in the microbiology field.
         The aim of our research is to identify the strains with a higher biosynthesis potential in the areal of the West Antarctica – King George Island, Penguin Island, and East Antarctica – Larsemann Hills and Gove Mountains.
The original character of this research consists in the extended area of the sampling spots in view of analyses.

              Scientific Objectives
              Elaboration of the laboratory biotechnology and the  anticipation for the semi-industrial conditions.
              The microorganisms in the Arctic and Antarctica are a representation of the past in a frozen form and could have a signifant impact on the evolution theories.  The microorganisms isolated from Antarctic biotops, in which the cells in a anabiotic state kept their distinct genetic characters unaltered for a long time, are, from the point of view of new microbial compound descovery, interesting candidates.

                                         Romanian Polar Research Institute 

                Scientific Objectives
              The project objective is to achieve a genomic comparison between similar bacterial species that live in completely different habitats (the regions of the Antarctica and the temperate one).    
          1. Identification of the bacterial strains by molecular biology methods 
          2. Analysis of the genomic differences between strains. 
          This study aims to put into evidence adaptations which enable the vital function development under low temperature conditions. 

Heavy metal ions in the water of the Planetary Ocean and in the fresh water in Antarctica
             (RO-06)
         Investigators of
Romanian Polar Research Institute
Research Institute for Rare and Nonferrous Metals, Bucharest, Romania

            Scientific Objectives             
Measuring the heavy metal pollution extention degree, the geografical variation, the space tendencies and the anthropic factors.
	This project covers the assessment of the pollutant terrestrial and marine levels in Antarctica, also considering the influences of the pollution sources inside and outside the Antarctic area. In this context, the pollution dynamics is compared to the levels determined in the previous years and correlated with the data obtained by the other countries being parts of the Antarctic Treaty.  
	The contaminants, including heavy metals, in the water or snow from the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic marine environment, are directly transported by the ocean currents. All the planet seas are in a continuous movement and connection due to the currents. Every toxic product, discharged in  any place, will spread anywhere in a few years.
  	  The concentration modifications of the different elements in the ocean water is influenced by numerous factors such as: the tide force can prevail in many of the archipelago channels, while the wind force is the most important for the surface currents. The main exchange, from the quantity point of view, between the Southern Ocean and the other oceans is directly achieved in the zone of 600 S latitude and on the Antarctic continent.        
             The research areal lies between the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Ocean,  the Antarctic seas and the White Continent. 

Elaboration  of the models related to the study of climate changes 
by means of oxigen -18 and deuterium isotopes
(RO-07)
Investigators of
Naţional Research and Development Institute  
for Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, Cluj-Napoca, Romania
Romanian Polar Research Institute

             Scientific Objectives
             Study of the isotopic effects generated within the water-ice-snow exchange in order to research the climatic changes in West Antarctica - King George Island and the Penguin Island, and  East Antarctica - Larsemann Hills and the Grove Mountains, located at 500 km inside the continent.   
             Taking into consideration the large ice surface of the Antarctica and the local geographical characteristics of the continent, it is important to significantly extent the investigation of the distribution of the δD şi δ18O isotope ratios in the surface snow, in ice and lake water. 
.           Thus, a better data base will be provided in order to interpret the isotopic profiles of the snow layer, and by means of isotopic models, to compare the climate parameters and the prevailing conditions of  precipitation accumulation. 
	           
Determination of the PCBs and organochorine pesticide distribution in the soils in Arctica, as compared to the levels of the concentrations in the Arctic soils
(RO-08)
Investigators from
Romanian Polar Research Institute

                 Scientific Objectives
          Measurement of the extention degree of contamination with PCBs and of the organo-chlorine pesticides, the geographical variation, anthropic factors that can increase the pollution groundlevel in Arctica and Antarctica, the influence on the organisms.         
              Organo-chlorine contaminant compounds multiply and persist in the environment for long time periods. These compounds are a contamination source for the big carnivorous animals, small whales, seals, birds of pray, and the polar bears that can be affected due to the chronical exposure to the persistent organic contaminants. 
               The pesticides, less persistent, includind atrazine,  endosulphan, chloropyriphos, chlorotalonyl şi metoxychlorine, have been detected in the air, fog and water of the Arctic seas and, in some cases, in plants and aquatic biota. These compounds are still used as pesticides in most of the countries in the circum-polar region and in other areas in the world. 
 Determination of the tritium concentrations in waters from lakes, snow and ice from Antarctica
         (RO-09)
Investigators of
       Romanian Polar Research Institute 
National Research and Development Institute for 
Cryogenic and Isotopic Technologies - ICSI Rm. Vâlcea, Romania    
      
          Scientific Objectives
	Determination of the distribution and level of tritium concentration activity in Antarctica, from cosmogenic and anthropic sources.  
           Tritium containing contaminants are transported in the marine environment directly by the ocean currents. All the planet seas are in a continuos movement and connection due to the currents. Each radioactive product discharged in any place spreads in a few years everywhere.
Quantities of Tritium from the waters of the Northern seas and the Southern Ocean can reach, by evaporation, in the terrestrial and fresh water ecosystems of the Arctic and Antarctica. 
In case of radioactive substance losses in the air, released from the nuclear plants, Tritium is one the radionuclids crytical for the envoronment, as it can be found in most cases as tritiated water. In this form, it follows the water circuit in Nature, remaining in the throposphere for a few days, and in the stratosphere for a few years.
