Annex II Review

Paragraphs 81 to 84 of the XXVII ATCM Final Report


    81 The Chair noted the extensive discussion on the revision of Annex II of the Protocol and referred the ATCM to the draft revised Annex II text at Appendix 9 of the CEP VII report. The Meeting agreed to refer this for further discussion at XXVIII ATCM.

    82 The Meeting welcomed the valuable work done by the ICG and the CEP in reviewing Annex II to the Protocol and agreed to attach a draft text of the Annex, as amended, to its Final Report (see Appendix 9).

    83 The Meeting noted that a number of technical matters had been resolved through this extensive exercise. However, some key policy matters of a more substantive nature remained to be addressed, in particular whether:

    • the title of the Annex should be amended and if, in doing so, whether its scope would be extended;
    • the Definitions (in Article I) should be modified;
    • to extend the designation of Special Protected Species to include marine species.
    • 
    84 Parties were urged to give these matters their attention during the intersessional period with a view to resolving any outstanding issues at XXVIII ATCM.
