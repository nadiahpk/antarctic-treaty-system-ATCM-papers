1.	Introduction

A draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE) has been carried out by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) for the proposed construction and operation of Halley VI Research Station, Brunt Ice Shelf, Caird Coast, Antarctica. The draft CEE has been prepared in accordance with Annex I of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1998).

The UK Government has approved and endorsed the draft CEE. It was released by BAS on 4 February 2005 and notification of the report was sent by Diplomatic Note to all Parties to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. At the same time, e-mail notification was sent to all members of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) via the CEP Contact Mailing List. 

2.	Circulation of the draft CEE

The UK has submitted the non-technical summary of the draft CEE as a Working Paper to the CEP. This is to ensure that the non-technical summary can be translated into the four official Treaty languages.  

The UK is also attaching the full text of the draft CEE to this Information Paper. The full document is also available for download via the BAS website at www.antarctica.ac.uk/halleyvi/cee.html and in addition, the UK Delegation will make available CDs and colour printed copies of the draft CEE at the CEP.
