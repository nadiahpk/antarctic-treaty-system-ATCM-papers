SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES LIST 
FOR 2005-2006 SEASON
Brazil has been in Antarctica since 1983 and along all these years, Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) has been working in order to guarantee to the scientific community the opportunity to accomplish their researches in Antarctic Area. Such researches put Brazil on the top of science activity. Its efforts on studying the Antarctic Environment has being driven Brazil for a quality investigation development, what allows the country to understand its own ecosystem and meteorology. 
Brazil will develop 21 projects on the course of the next Antarctic Operation, XXIV OPERANTAR (2005/2006). An active and wide-ranging scientific program will consist of atmosphere, physical oceanography, biological oceanography, chemical oceanography, meteorology, architecture, cartography, geology and biology areas. 
PROANTAR, filled by cooperative spirit, makes available research projects goals with the respective project coordinator:
