IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism
2004-2005 Antarctic Season

Submitted by the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) 


The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to provide this summary of Antarctic tourism for the 2004-2005 season and a brief overview of Antarctic tourism trends. Additional information can be found on line at www.iaato.org. The information is presented on the best available knowledge at the time this document is presented. 

1.0	Overview

1.1	IAATO Member Activities
As in all years past, IAATO activities outweighed non-IAATO Member activities overall. A summary of IAATO Member activities follows:

    • 878 passengers participated in land-based expeditions. 
    • 16,702 passengers traveled aboard seaborne vessels and landed in the Antarctic Peninsula area.
    • 383 passengers traveled aboard vessels and landed in the Ross Sea or Continental region of Antarctica.
    • 130 passengers participated in an air/cruise voyage to Antarctica departing from South America and landing at King George Island, embarked a vessel and sailed for six days. These numbers are inclusive of the 16,702 noted above.
    • 4,358 passengers traveled aboard large cruise vessels that were cruise-only (and did not land in Antarctica).
    • 462 passengers participated in over-flights from South America to Antarctica aboard aircraft.
    • More than 1,568 passengers have participated in over flights to Antarctica from Australia. 
    • All operators have submitted Initial Environmental Impact Assessments or Preliminary Assessments or operational documents as required by domestic legislation to their appropriate National authority.
    • 1 new cruise vessel, 2 additional small vessels which previously operated in Antarctica and 1 private-non commercial yacht and one new cruise-only vessel managed under an experienced company operated in 2004-2005.



        1.2 Non-IAATO Operators’ Activities
    •  4,088 passengers traveled aboard two non-IAATO operated vessels or aircraft, landing passengers in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Operators complied with their National legislation.
    • Unknown numbers of passengers traveled on sailing vessels/yachts. Information pertaining to these vessels was not possible to obtain from either the vessel operators or National authorities. A list of vessels has been provided in this report in Appendix A.
    • One vessel carrying 669 passengers cruised but did not land passengers.
    • Government-supported tourism activities on ships and aircraft occurred, but information has not been provided to IAATO for activities departing from South Africa and South America.
    • 43 Tourists participated in a program offered by Uruguay at Artigas Station. Uruguay did notify IAATO of its activities. 
    • Several private and some commercial activities where Advance Notification and Post Visit Site Reports have been filed through their National authority have not been forwarded to IAATO for inclusion in this report. 
    • Several countries did not require Environmental Impact Assessments and/or Post Visit Site Reports from commercial tourist operations. Despite repeated requests by IAATO to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCP’s) to compile all landing and/or cruise information in order to incorporate into the yearly statistics, the required Post Visit Site Reports were not forthcoming; therefore the numbers of passengers are noted as estimates or approximate where hard data was not available.

        1.3 Commercial Tourist Activities 
Commercial tourist activities included small boat (Zodiac, naiad, R.I.B etc.) cruising, shore landings, and to a lesser extent kayaking, mountain climbing, scuba diving, skiing, snowboarding, camping, and helicopter operations. All of these activities have taken place for a minimum of six years with some dating back to the beginning of Antarctic tourism in the 1960’s. A brief summary of the season, including an "IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism 2004-2005,” and “IAATO Preliminary Estimate of Antarctic Tourism, 2005-2006,” are appended as Appendix A and Appendix C, respectively, which provide further details of the operators, vessels and numbers.

Based on information returned to IAATO in annual reports or in the Post Visit Site Reports from the 2004-2005 season, it is estimated that at least 22,175 passengers landed in the Antarctic on private sector seaborne and land-based expeditions. 

Nearly all commercial tour companies during the 2004-2005 season were located in Contracting Party States.

    2.0 Commercial Seaborne Tourism
2.1	Seasonal Estimates
It is estimated that 22,297 passengers landed in the Antarctic on 36 commercially-organized tour vessels plus numerous sailing vessels and/or yachts and one private yacht from November 2004 to March 2005. This represents a 13% increase over the 2003-2004 season where a total of 19,669 ship-based passengers was reported traveling aboard 29 vessels and sailing vessels/yachts. This number includes members and non-IAATO operators.

IAATO members operated all but 5 of the tour vessels that sailed during the 2004 – 2005 season. IAATO’s Bylaws state that vessels carrying more than 500 do not land passengers ashore and that stringent landing restrictions are placed on vessels carrying more than 200 passengers at specific landing sites due to environmental considerations. Two of the vessels capable of carrying more than 500 passengers operated by non-IAATO companies landed more than 500 passengers. Neither company is interested in IAATO Membership. The remaining companies have already applied for membership in IAATO for 2005-06 and were accepted.

	Table 1 is based in companies who have provided Post Visit Site Reports/

2.2	The vast majority of Antarctic voyages operate to the Antarctic Peninsula region during the five-month austral summer season (from November – March), departing from Ushuaia, or, to a lesser extent, from Port Stanley, Punta Arenas, Valparaiso, Puerto Madryn, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. 
	
	The three large cruise vessels (Amsterdam, Royal Princess, and Insignia) carrying more than 500 passengers which conducted cruise-only operations visited Antarctica for a approximately 72-hour time period on each cruise and carried a total of 5,027 passengers to the Antarctic Peninsula area. 

IAATO has been able to incorporate companies who have not previously submitted Post Visit Site Reports to IAATO in the 2004-2005 data. Some companies that have previously operated this year began working cooperatively with IAATO. IAATO cautions users who compare data from year to year without looking at individual vessels.

3.0	Commercial Antarctic Sailing Vessels and/or Yachts (Non-IAATO Operators)

Based on information received by the IAATO Secretariat, a total of 100 passengers were reported to have traveled to Antarctica aboard 18 or more non-IAATO operator  commercial sailing vessels and/or yachts during the 2004-2005 season. This information is compiled at Palmer Station, Arthur Harbor, by US-NSF staff, and by information provided by the Antarctic Heritage Trust personnel at Port Lockroy. During IAATO’s Annual General Meeting, May 2-5, 2005, six yacht operators who have been sailing in the Antarctica Peninsula for many years applied 	for membership. Future reporting of yacht activities will hopefully now be more comprehensive.

3.1	Commercial sailing vessels/yachts with fare-paying passengers include the Pelagic and Pelagic Australis (IAATO Member Pelagic Expeditions) and Golden Fleece (IAATO Member Golden Fleece Expeditions) and Tooluka (IAATO Member BV Tooluka). Non IAATO Members who submitted Post Visit Site Reports to IAATO include the sailing vessel Australis. Others (non-IAATO operators) are listed in the table “Overview of Non-IAATO Operated Sailing Vessels/Yachts 2004-05.”  Antarctic Treaty Parties permitting sailing vessel/yacht operations should encourage the use of the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO requests copies whenever possible of all Post Visit Site reports for non-member companies so that tourism data can be compiled on landing sites and overall numbers. This will also assist in compiling data for use in furthering the understanding of potential cumulative impacts. This same request was also made to ATCM XXV, ATCM XXVI and ATCM XXVII, although no parties have responded to IAATO’s request.

3.2	IAATO compiled the list of companies that operated during the 2004-2005 season so that National Programs that are overseeing sailing vessel/yacht activities from their respective countries can ensure that the Environmental Protocol requirements have been met. 

	3.3	Activities Conducted from Expedition Cruise Vessels
All activities are approved to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.

	3.3.1	Camping in the Peninsula
Three IAATO Members offer camping as it provides an excellent opportunity for passengers to experience a sense of wilderness in Antarctica, separate from being on the ship. This activity has taken place for at least nine years in the Peninsula region. Campsites are generally located at least 650 ft from nesting birds, including penguins. Camping is on snow or bare rock, rather than on gravel where the ground could be flattened by tent sites. Each campsite is used for no more than a few nights per season. Toilets are generally taken ashore, human waste returned to the ship and meals are only eaten on board the ship.

	3.3.2	Climbing and Kayaking from Ships in the Peninsula Area
Climbing and kayaking have proven to be successful activities for more than eight years in the Antarctic Peninsula area.

3.3.3	Scuba Diving
Scuba diving has been offered on some IAATO Member operated vessels for six years. During the 2004-2005 season three companies offered scuba diving. One tourist died while diving this season.

3.3.4	Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) 
An ROV has been used by one IAATO Member for at least three years. The ROV is used for educational purposes. Video footage is taken by the ROV and aired aboard ship for passengers to be able to experience first-hand the life under water. 
In addition this same company used a new National Geographic type deep sea camera to film underwater sea life. Photographs of numerous under-sea creatures including ribbon worms, giant amphipods and the little Nothothenia sp. and others were photographed and shared for educational purposes with passengers on board the ship.
	
3.3.5	Helicopter Operations 
Helicopter operations were conducted by one IAATO Member since the 1992-1993 season in the Ross Sea/Continental area of Antarctica. 

            3.3.6  Hovercraft Operation
One company trial tested a Hovercraft in Antarctica and plans to use it as an alternative landing craft during the 2005-2006 season. 

4.0	Commercial Land-based Tourism
	
4.1 	IAATO member Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions (referred to as ALE below) operated out of Punta Arenas, Chile, for the 19th consecutive season. ALE carried a total of 190 clients, 22 Government and VIP personnel, and 100 staff and aircrew.  Activities included the operation of standard programs, organization and operation of expeditions, services for private expeditions and support for government activities. ALE’s operations included the following:

ALE Aircraft Operations:
    • One Ilyushin-76 for was used to ferry cargo, fuel and passengers from Punta Arenas to Patriot Hills for a total of fourteen flights.
    • Two ski-equipped Twin-Otter aircraft were used for interior flights throughout the Antarctic season. 


Patriot Hills Camp:
    • Patriot Hills Camp opened 23 October 2004 and closed 22 January 2005.

Comments by ALE/ANI and Land-Based Activities

IAATO promotes environmentally responsible travel to Antarctica and ALE helps to achieve this by the use of renewable resources wherever possible. Since its inception in 1987 Ale’s Patriot Hills camp has used renewable power sources for all its electrical generation. 

Other reasons for using renewable sources include the fact that staff and guests prefer the true silence of the Antarctic as well as economic savings from not using fossil fuels for power generation. 

Wind generation has been tried but has proved noisy, needed a large storage capacity and was not robust enough for the prevailing wind conditions.

10 x 32 watt solar panels provide sufficient power for communications equipment, computing and maintaining a small battery storage unit. Power tools run on rechargeable batteries. Most heating of tents is passive, relying on solar radiation on tents with well insulated walls and floors.

Expeditions Supported by ALE/ANI

ALE/ANI supported three independent expeditions during the 2004-2005 season. Other expeditions formed part of ALE/ANI’s standard advertised programs. 

Polar-to-Pole expedition, led by Steve Brooks, completed their North Pole to South Pole journey during the season. The expedition flew from Ushuaia to Patriot Hills, fuelling at various pre-placed fuel caches along the route. Following a successful visit to the South Pole, the helicopter flew back to Patriot Hills where it was partially disassembled and flown out of Antarctica in an Ilyushin-76.
The expedition submitted environmental documentation that was approved by US EPA, including a comprehensive Search & Rescue support system for the entire flight that incorporated the services of Argentine Air Traffic Control, DAP and ALE.
ALE supported two overland expeditions, Expedition Trans-Antarctica and “Expedition X”, permitted through the United Kingdom, that made attempts to reach the South Pole by ski and 4-wheel drive vehicle. The latter was unsuccessful due to adverse snow conditions for the type of vehicle.
ALE completed cleaning the site of Jennifer Murray’s Bell 407 helicopter that crashed in December 2003. ALE had hoped the site could be cleared in January 2004 but problems with the aircraft insurers caused the work to be delayed. All wreckage and several containers of contaminated snow were removed from the site in December 2004. All material and waste was returned to Punta Arenas, Chile, for disposal. No further remedial work is required.

ALE’s support for government activities included transporting 3 scientists for INACH and 17,000kg cargo for CESC to Patriot Hills. ALE also provided fuel and transported 2,500kg of cargo, including building materials, for support flights by FACH. ALE removed 10,000kg of human waste, garbage and refuse as part of the Chilean clean up of their facilities. 

To improve weather prediction at the runway location, and thereby enhance safety for flights, ALE provided support to Stanford University, USA, to install Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) at Patriot Hills and three other locations up to 200km inland from Patriot Hills, in the direction of the prevailing weather.

	
4.2 	Air/ Land-based Activities-DAP

In 2004-2005, there were 29 flights by IAATO Member, Aerovias DAP in either a King Air or Dash 7 aircraft totaling 657 passengers. DAP offered both a one day flight seeing and landing at King George Island and an overnight program where passengers stay on King George Island in DAP’s land based facilities. Passengers accompanied by a guide, visit Frei, Marsh, Bellingshausen and Great Wall stations, and surrounding wildlife areas. This represents an increase from 398 passengers in 2003-2004. DAP also provided the EMER (Emergency Medical and Evacuation Response) plan for IAATO. In 2005, DAP also purchased a small logistics vessel which will operate for both science requests and adventure tourism requests. Heli-Skiing was attempted by a group of passengers in March 2005 from the vessel, however the weather was not cooperative. DAP transports numerous scientists to and from Chile to King George Island and has been operating programs in Antarctica since 1985.

5.0	Air Operations – Flight Seeing 

5.1	IAATO Member Lan Chile operated 9 flights to the Antarctic Peninsula area in a 60-passenger capacity Boeing 737-200. A total of 462 passengers were carried during the 2004-2005 season. 

The flying routes varied according to weather conditions but basically were conducted as follows:
    • King George Island, Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston and 
Deception Islands (South Shetland Islands)
    • King George Island and the Antarctic Peninsula crossing over to the Weddell Sea (in the proximities of Seymour and James Ross Islands) with an over-flight near Marambio Station

Numerous flights to the Antarctic Peninsula region operate from Punta Arenas but information on these flights prior to 2003-2004 had been difficult to obtain. 

Over-flights to the Antarctic Peninsula area from Punta Arenas operate frequently from November to March, by Lan Chile and Aerovias DAP. These flights are offered as an optional excursion to cruise ship passengers and independent travelers calling at Punta Arenas.  

5.2	During the 2004-2005 season IAATO Member, Croydon Travel of Victoria, Australia, operated six Antarctic day sightseeing flights, approximately 11-12 hours in duration, from Australia aboard a Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 aircraft for the ninth consecutive season. 

A total of 2,030 passengers participated in 4 flights. In addition, the aircraft carried a total of 132 crew members during the season. To date, Croydon has operated a total of 76 flights carrying nearly 27,857 passengers since commencing Antarctic operations in the 1994-1995 season.

The aircraft operate at a minimum altitude of 10,000 ft or 2,000 ft above the highest ground within 100 nautical miles. The flight itineraries primarily operate along the northern Victoria Land coast, and the Oates, George V and Adélie Coasts. Pilots avoid any known penguin colonies by a horizontal separation of at least one mile and Croydon staff provides a full in-flight lecture and education program utilizing at least three experienced lecturers and at least six videos. A comprehensive information kit is provided to passengers and “live” ground-to-air interviews are conducted with staff members at Australian and occasionally at Italian bases.

6.0	Preliminary Estimate of Planned Activities for the 2005-2006 Season

Appendix C illustrates a breakout of tourism categories in order to clearly see the diversification of the tourist activities that are expected to occur during the 2005-2006 season. This is an estimate based on information provided to the IAATO Secretariat. Note that most of the activities listed have occurred in the past 12-13 years but have not necessarily been presented in such detail. IAATO is attempting to present as much factual information as possible in order to clarify activities that have occurred, and are planned for the future. The histogram in Appendix B illustrates estimated and actual tourism figures since the 1992-1993 season.

For the 2005-2006 season seaborne or ship-based tourism will once again include helicopter, small boat (Zodiac, R.I.B, naiad), shore landings, camping, kayaking, scuba diving, climbing, hovercraft and use of an underwater ROV.

6.1	According to estimates provided to IAATO by tour operators, during the 2005-2006 season 26,587 seaborne and sailing vessel/yacht passengers are expected to land in Antarctica on commercially-organized tour vessels and 1,100 on land-based expeditions. Another 4,700 are anticipated on cruise-only programs and 2,350 on over-flights. These figures represent increases in all categories from the 2004-2005 season.  See Appendix C for a complete breakdown of member and non-member activities.
	
6.2	Non-IAATO operator activities are of concern to IAATO. At least two of the 500+ capacity passenger vessel operators plan to land passengers in Antarctica over the course of nine departures. There are 9 departures by ships that have the potential to land at least 550 tourists per departure.

6.3	DAP is planning on flying passengers from Punta Arenas to King George Island and either offering a day trip or overnight at the Frei/Marsh Station. In addition, there are five fly/cruise programs that include a flight from Punta Arenas to King George Island where passengers embark a ship (at Frei), sail and make landings in the Antarctic Peninsula for five days before flying back to Punta Arenas.

6.4	IAATO has not been informed of possible activities in Dronning Maud Land during the 2004-2005 or 2005-2006 seasons.

6.5	Some National Program vessels carry fare-paying passengers. National Programs are encouraged to report their passenger numbers and activities if they are landing at typical tourist sites so IAATO can account for the “footprint” and address cumulative impact issues. (Post Visit Site Reports should also be compiled for these activities.) 

    7.0 Antarctic Tourism Trends

7.1	From 1989-2003, the US-NSF and IAATO have compiled and distributed detailed information on Antarctic tourist activities. IAATO collaborates with US-NSF to ensure that all of the data on Antarctic tourism is represented, not just that of US organizers or IAATO Members. Tourism data as of the 2003-2004 season and onwards has been taken over by IAATO and all information can be found on the IAATO website. This data is an invaluable resource, showing tourism activity at individual landing sites over time. Merging the legendary data with the current data could be a long-term project.

	7.2	The following data sheets are being prepared for inclusion in the IAATO website (www.iaato.org) under the category of “Tourism Statistics:” IAATO has exhibited on its website statistics for the 2003-04 season which include the pages listed below. In addition the same will be posted for the 2004-2005 season when completed: 

Tourists by Nationality (Landed), Tourists by Nationality (Air and Cruise), Tourists by Nationality (All), Tourist Nationalities by Vessel, Trends 1992-2005, Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per site per vessel-All Antarctic Sites (6 Sheets in Total), Number of Visitors (tourists, staff, crew) per Site per Vessel-Continental Sites, Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-All Antarctic Sites, Number of Tourists per Site per Vessel, Number of Tourists per Site Per Vessel-Peninsula Sites, Number of Visits per Site/per Activity.

	7.3	IAATO currently predicts that Antarctic tourism will continue to grow both in seaborne and to a lesser degree by land-based activities. The increase in numbers, however, does not necessarily reflect impacts in the Antarctic nor is this an indication of how long passengers would be on land. IAATO will continue to monitor developments in the tourism industry. 

		Tourism in the Ross Sea region will increase slightly during the 2005-2006 season, but there is little evidence that there will be significant increases in years to come. This is due to a limited operational season, and potentially restricted access to the Ross Sea and Continental area of the Antarctic.

	7.4	A Trends Chart showing the change in Tourism from 1992-2006 can be found in Appendix B of this paper.

8.0	Conclusion
In practice and as long as the information is available to the IAATO Secretariat, all tour operators – whether or not associated with IAATO – are included in emergency contact and other information, scheduling, etc. Government and National Program representatives and prospective IAATO Members are encouraged to participate in open sessions of IAATO’s General Meeting where IAATO Bylaws, operating procedures, and policies are developed, as well as where obligations of the Antarctic Treaty System are discussed. 

IAATO-Member activities continue to have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. IAATO as an organization is focused on minimizing impacts and consequently evaluates all relevant tourist activities. IAATO recommends that all tourist activities be transparent, as not all tourist activities are presently being reported.
