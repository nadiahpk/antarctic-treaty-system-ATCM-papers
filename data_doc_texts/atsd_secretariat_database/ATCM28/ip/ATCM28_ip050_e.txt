Communication in the Polar Regions is difficult for a number of reasons; technological, geographical, and financial hardships. An effort to map and describe different solutions has been made by the PoleCom project team sponsored the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat and Ericsson Response. The PoleCom team consists of six students conducting a project that is a part of the Communication System Design course given 2005 at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.


Abstract
The project has been made primarily with Polar Research Expeditions in mind. Research has been done in a variety of technical areas, as well as testing of applications and solutions. Manufacturers, technological experts, end users, and polar researchers have in different ways been involved in the project.

The results of the project are presented as a report and as a handbook made to function as a guide to communication technologies suitable for use under the special circumstances which can arise at a Polar expedition. As well as presenting the information in a uniform way to ease comparison the handbook also contains a section with the different technologies compared. Both currently available and future technologies are featured for varying budgets. The handbook describes solutions for some different scenarios related to polar expeditions.
