Report of the International Association of 
Antarctica Tour Operators  2004-2005
Report of the International Association of 
Antarctica Tour Operators  2004-2005 
Under Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty


The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is pleased to present a report of its activities to ATCM XXVIII, Stockholm, Sweden June 6-17, 2005, in relation to Article III (2) of the Antarctic Treaty.

IAATO is a member organization founded by seven companies in 1991 to advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic. During the 2004-2005 season IAATO had 70 Members, and as of May 5, 2005, the Association grew to 78 Members during the annual meeting.  Overall tourism numbers reached at least 30,232, including seaborne, air overflights and land-based tourism. Despite the increase in tourists, numbers of vessels and aircraft operations the season went smoothly and IAATO Members continued to support established practices that have proved to be effective and offer a strong degree of protection to the areas visited. IAATO operators are mostly business competitors of one another yet they are willing to work closely together to develop and impose best practices upon themselves. For industry to agree to set limits is rare in today’s world and there is no other model that has been as successful as IAATO’s for the last 15 years continuously. As an Association, IAATO seeks to raise the operational standards of Members and the industry as a whole. To do so requires an infrastructure, a forum and a time and economic commitment by each company. 

IAATO has continued to focus its activities in several key areas including:
    • Providing a forum for Members to resource information needed to effectively manage their individual operations but yet plan strategically with all other operators. This is done through regular email network and by maintaining useful documents on the website and at the annual meeting.
    • Uploading a new and user friendly, quick-loading IAATO website,
    • Activating the IAATO Tourism Database and successfully uploading all available Post Visit Site Reports into the database. 2003-2004 tourism statistics were computed and posted on IAATO’s website. The database has additional capability that is used to compile all company, vessel and activity information and track IAATO’s activities. IAATO posted over 60 different data reports on tourism statistics on www.iaato.org as a matter of interest to the general public. The 2004-2005 data will be available in July,
    • Improvements were made to the Standard Post Visit Site Report Form in order to be more inclusive of all tourism activities and data collection (See ATCM XXVIII, IP 89),
    • IAATO made available to the public on the IAATO website Visitor Guidelines. (Recommendation XVIII-1 in English, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese and Russian.) IAATO has always used these guidelines but with only the exception of a few languages all were hard copies versus computer versions,
    • Updated the “Seasonal Operational Procedures” found on the Members-Only page of the website to assure greater protection of the Antarctic,
    • Commissioned a computer programming company to design an automated ship schedule that individual companies can input their itineraries directly on line and make changes to as often as needed prior to the season. This will improve efficiency, safety, and overall communication prior to the season. When more cost efficient communication networks are installed on all vessels, companies can access ship schedules from the vessel. IAATO also has been liaising with COMNAP to be “more inclusive” of all ships operating in Antarctica,
    • Promote Vessel and Aircraft Coordination by using an all inclusive ship schedule, vessel call data and emergency response list. This list is shared with COMNAP and those National Antarctic Programs that interact with tour operators on a regular basis throughout the season,
    • Continued use of the IAATO Member Emergency Medical Evacuation Response (EMER) action plan,
    • Adherence to the IAATO Site Specific Guidelines (ATCM XXVI IP72) established in 2003. Thirty-two sites were identified and limits set accordingly.  IAATO also has trial tested for two years ten Site Specific Guidelines prepared by the United Kingdom (four of which were submitted to ATCM XXVI and ATCM XXVII/WP26 and to ATCM XXVIII) to evaluate their effectiveness to address impacts and concern towards growth in the tourism industry. IAATO will provide a separate paper to ATCM XXVIII on Site Guidelines and the findings of our results,
    • Continued to support all methods necessary to eliminate the potential spreading of Antarctic diseases and translocation of species,
    • Participation in several Intersessional Working Groups (ICG’s), 
    • Participation in international meetings and liaising with National Antarctic Programs, government agencies of the sub-Antarctic island groups, and scientific and environmental organizations as needed,
    • Closely coordinated with Provisional Members in their start-up operations and offered support to companies who have employees new to the business,
    • Created an IAATO Newsletter which can be found on line at www.iaato.org,
    • Established additional sound business practices to improve the capability to promote IAATO as a worldwide resource for Antarctic tourism.
    • Commissioned a project to analyze 5 years of visits to sites in the Antarctic Peninsula (See ATCM XXVIII IP 81),
    • Furthered work on the proposed IAATO internal Accreditation Scheme as per (SeeATCM XXVII IP 69.)

2	2004-2005 Statistics

   2.1		IAATO Member Activities
		From November 2004 to March 2005, a total of 16,955 passengers/tourists landed in the Antarctic on 29 commercially organized expedition vessels, 130 passengers/tourists participated in a fly cruise program and 878 land-based tourists flew, skied, climbed, camped or simply participated in day or overnight trips to Antarctica. In addition, 4,358 tourists travelled on three (IAATO-Member) large cruise only vessels (on 4 departures), and 462 passengers/tourists participated in air over flights to Antarctica.

An all inclusive overview of the Antarctic tourism industry can be found in the IAATO Overview of Antarctic Tourism (ATCM XXVIII-IP82). 
	
2.2	Tourism numbers increased during the 2004-2005 season from the previous season. Data on tourism activities and actual numbers of non-IAATO operators has become more readily available over the years and, therefore, overall numbers are higher this year not only because of additional statistical data being available, but also because of an increase in the Antarctic tourism industry as a whole.

3 	Participation in Organized Meetings during 2004-2005

3.1 	IAATO held its 16th General Meeting, May 2-5, 2005 in Hamburg, Germany. A total of 111 participants attended which included 84 people representing 49 Member companies and our new Provisional Member applicants, one non-IAATO operator plus 25 representatives from governments, universities, conservation and private research organizations. 

Several Members once again sponsored the attendance of their expedition team. Participating were 8 Captains and 12 Expedition Leaders. It is essential that our field personnel are brought into the discussions as they add a reality check into all discussions and final decisions. 

We were pleased that Mr. Jan Huber from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) was able to join us for the first time and all our members look forward to future cooperation with the ATS. 

IAATO appreciates the participation by respective governments and non governmental organizations. The following governments sent representatives: the German Foreign Ministry office, Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency-Germany), Swedish Tourism Authority, Australian Antarctic Division, United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth office, British Antarctic Survey, United States-Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation, and Raytheon Polar Services. During the last decade approximately 65% of the nationalities of the tourists’ visting Antarctica come from the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia. IAATO was pleased that the corresponding governments were present. IAATO encourages government interactions with tour operators and considers it very important that governments share their concerns with operators. Other organizations/universities in attendance included the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust, and the Antarctic Research Trust, University of Jena, Southampton Institute, and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office.
	
IAATO Members appreciated the participation of the Executive Secretary of the Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operator’s Organization (AECO) in our annual meeting in order to better address Arctic (particularly Svalbard) concerns since some IAATO members operate in Svalbard but are not members of AECO. The input from the Governor of Svalbard’s office and World Wildlife Fund-Arctic and Spitsbergen Travel added yet another polar element to the work that IAATO considers.  AECO used this opportunity to hold one meeting during the evening and during one luncheon concurrently.
	
The complete agenda can be found on IAATO’s web site at www.iaato.org under information papers. Included in this year’s agenda was a discussion on IAATO business (new members, members changing categories, review of observer reports, committee reports, committee discussions, International Polar Year), station visits, landings and site guidelines, future computerized versions of ship schedules, quality reporting on post visit site reports, marine operators issues, supervision of staff, passengers, crew, marine-related topics, updated from the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO), accreditation, environmental impact assessments, updates from Port Lockroy, human impacts on King George Island, AECO, Arctic conservation and research proposals. 

IAATO will most likely hold its 17th General Meeting in the United States in May 2006 (final dates to be decided). Interested parties that would like to attend or participate should contact the IAATO Secretariat at iaato@iaato.org.

        3.2 IAATO had several representatives at the COMNAP/SCAR meeting in Bremen in July 2004. Overall it was an impressive meeting with very important and positive interactions between national operators and the science community. IAATO attended parts of the COMNAP-TANGO and the Air Operations working groups.

        3.3 IAATO was very pleased to send one participant to the IHO/IHB Meeting in Greece in September 2004. IAATO supports and encourages the work the IHO is doing on improving charting and navigational aids in Antarctica and other parts of the world. Safety and navigation are extremely important concerns to vessel operators who feel that improved charting will greatly reduce the risk of accidents and potential environmental damage. The focused work done by the Antarctic Committee of this group is valuable for all ship operators.

        3.4 IAATO sent one representative to Bryan, Texas to attend the NSF/SCAR/COMNAP Environmental Monitoring Meeting. The meeting was an excellent forum for discussing various biological indicators and looking at future ways to further identify cumulative impacts as a result of human activity in Antarctica. 

        3.5 IAATO valued the time spent with the informal working group of liability representatives in New York City, April 2005, and applauds this group in its efforts to move liability forward at ATCM XXVIII.

        3.6 Several IAATO Members met with their various governments during the last year to discuss tourism issues in the Antarctic and Arctic. Members felt that these meetings proved extremely useful. IAATO encourages Parties to interact with their resident tour operators whenever possible so that both stakeholders can gain a better understanding of each other’s concerns. 


4	Field Coordination

4.1	IAATO compiles seasonal updated information; including vessel call data, a comprehensive ship schedule, emergency contact information, expedition leader schedules, and yearly seasonal operational procedures. During the 2004-2005 season there was heavy ice throughout parts of the Antarctic Peninsula for most of the season. This situation truly tested the abilities of the ships to communicate with each other and find suitable landing sites while still maintaining the one ship at one site at one time principle, given the ice restrictions, particularly in the Lemaire Channel and surrounding areas. The ships successfully maintained IAATO’s operating philosophy despite the growth in tourism.

4.2	IAATO’s comprehensive directory of vessel call data and ship schedules are shared with COMNAP and other government office to encourage improved communication and operational coordination. COMNAP’s MINIATOM is an extremely useful tool for tour operators trying to contact stations or government vessels. As IAATO vessels transport numerous scientists and support personnel to Antarctica each year in addition to requesting tourist visits to stations, it is helpful when station contact information is up-to-date for communication, planning and emergency purposes. IAATO also encourages COMNAP to have an emergency call list of commercial operators to contact in case of emergencies. 

4.4	Expedition leaders and ship's officers circulate advance day-to-day itineraries and maintain regular contact throughout the season to coordinate site visits and exchange general information such as ice conditions, weather, landing recommendations, and concern about potential environmental impacts, etc. A key factor in managing Antarctic tourism and mitigating potential environmental impact is to ensure that no two ships land passengers at the same place at the same time. An example of the annual instructions to ships’ captains, radio officers and expedition leaders is included as Appendix A. 
	
4.5	Details on IAATO’s Emergency Medical Evacuation Response plan (EMER) have been presented at previous ATCMs. IAATO Member Aerovias DAP offered this service for Members during the 2004-2005 season. Aerovias DAP performed a total of two tourist medical evacuations for members from King George Island to Punta Arenas. 

5	Environmental Impact Assessment 

5.1	Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom and United States received Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA’s) from Members operating vessels or land-based programs. 

5.2	IAATO is concerned about non-IAATO operator activities, the Association urges Contracting Parties to ensure that obligations of the Environmental Protocol are being met and that Environmental Impact Assessments are being submitted and that detailed mitigation measures are included.

5.3	IAATO would also request that when non-IAATO operators submit EIA’s that reference IAATO’s operational procedures contact IAATO for verification. It is not possible for non-IAATO operators to have the breadth or understanding of the numerous operating strategies IAATO has developed over the years. 

6	Procedures to Prevent the Introduction of Alien Organisms

6.1	For the past six seasons, IAATO’s Boot and Clothing Decontamination Recommended Guidelines and Translocation of Diseases Protocol have proven to be effective. These guidelines unofficially have been operative for the last twelve years by most Members. Past ATCM papers have included this important guideline. Both the above-mentioned guidelines have been tabled previously as attachments at SATCM XII, ATCM XXIV, ATCM XXV and XXVII  (in IAATO’s Annual Reports). A separate paper has been tabled to ATCM XXVIII on this subject matter.

6.2	For the past five seasons, IAATO has used a standard protocol to report any high mortality incidents and to avoid the introduction and translocation of alien diseases. The only reported incident was at Cooper Bay in South Georgia due to Avian Cholera. (See page 10, Section 13.)
	
	

7	Reporting of Tourism and Non-governmental Activities and Data Base

7.1	Antarctic tour operators use the standard Post Visit Site Report form. IAATO modified the report slightly and changes have been submitted separately to reflect the increased number of activities. IAATO encourages the use of the revised form and discontinue the use of outdated reporting forms.  IAATO proposes to ATCM the adoption of the changes made by IAATO to the form. (ATCM XXVIII IP 89.)

7.2	IAATO continues to support the use of this single form, which reduces the burden of paperwork and facilitates the study of the scope, frequency and intensity of tourist activities. IAATO would like to encourage Parties to send IAATO a copy of any forms received from non-IAATO operators in order for the data to be incorporated into IAATO’s “Overview of Tourism” and the IAATO tourism data base. This will provide for greater transparency of all tourist activities and will further the ability to address cumulative impact issues. IAATO’s data base will be able to access information from these forms and analyze, if necessary, statistics on site visitation. 

8	Implementation of Recommendation XVIII-1 (Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic and Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic) and Other Guidelines

	Recommendation XVIII-1, “Guidance for Those Organising and Conducting Tourism and non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic” is provided to inform Members of key obligations and procedures to be followed.

        8.1 IAATO is concerned about tourists travelling on non-IAATO vessels visiting the Antarctic who may not be aware of the Environmental Protocol and its obligations. Some of these vessels visit stations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and it would be practical if station leaders were able to raise these issues with sailing vessel/yacht operators. 

        8.2 IAATO’s standard operating procedures for implementing Recommendation XVIII-1 include the following: 

    • Mandatory briefings on each tour ship prior to arrival in the Antarctic. This presentation consists of the IAATO slide or PowerPoint presentation. This presentation can be viewed on line at www.iaato.org under “Guidance for Visitors” on the home page. Most expedition leaders will however enhance the presentation with additional slides. 
    • Passengers, ships’ command, crew and expedition staff receive paper copies of Recommendation XVIII-1 “Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic.” Some companies distribute this document in pre-season materials in advance of departure, some on board the ship. In addition to receiving copies of the Recommendation, all passengers and ship’s personnel are required to attend the briefing. 
    • Guidelines are available on the open pages on the IAATO website in English, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish. 

8.3	In addition, IAATO Members continue to use IAATO and/or company adopted guidelines which include: marine wildlife watching, site specific information, kayak, mountain climbing, camping, scuba, helicopter, Zodiac, Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV), boot and clothing decontamination and disease protocols.

9	Emergency Response Action and Contingency Planning

9.1	At IAATO’s 14th General Meeting (2003) the IAATO-Wide Emergency Contingency Plan was agreed upon. This plan was submitted as a separate paper to ATCM XXVI/IP69. Operational focus referenced in this paper is part of the yearly checklist members are asked to include each season. The information on vessels shared amongst Members in the plan is essential for effective response action. 

9.2	IAATO continues to update data on tour vessels’ specifications and other information that would contribute to assisting in case of an emergency. Information is being added to the IAATO database for future reference.

9.3	Members have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEP) in place on their vessels that satisfy Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL. A “Special Antarctic Addendum” to the SOPEP was developed by IAATO and distributed to Members for implementation and comment in 1998 (ATCM XXII/IP104). While the Addendum has no legal status, it includes notice to contact Antarctic stations in the vicinity of any marine pollution incident, along with appropriate national authorities. 

9.4	The IAATO-wide EMER plan has been in place for at least the past seven seasons in order to reduce the need to impact scientific stations in the Antarctic Peninsula with tourism-related medical problems. A standard medical information checklist is available for new Members in order to ensure adequate medical supplies are available on board vessels.

10	Scientific and Information Support 

	Members continue to provide logistic and scientific support to National Antarctic Programs and to the sub-Antarctic Islands, providing a cost-effective resource for the scientific community. During the 2004-2005 season, scientists, support personnel and gear from various National Antarctic and Sub Antarctic Programs were provided transport to and from stations, field sites and gateway ports. A partial list of scientific support is included as Appendix D. Further descriptions are noted below.

	Specific requests for logistic or other support should be made to Members or the IAATO Secretariat. For a complete Membership directory, please refer to the IAATO web site at www.iaato.org.

11	Conservation Research, Academic and Scientific Support

Members and their passengers continued the tradition of direct financial contributions to many organizations active in Antarctica. Appendix C provides a partial list of donations. 


12	Observers On Board Member Vessels 

IAATO requires Provisional and Probational Members to carry an observer before they are eligible to apply for Full Membership. During the 2004-2005 season, IAATO appointed 5 observers to sail on Provisional Member vessels and one land-based operation. IAATO prefers to use a qualified National Program observer from the country in which the company is registered. When not available, IAATO will appoint an appropriate person with broad experience in Antarctic and or related matters. IAATO has a checklist for observers, which has been tabled at ATCM XXIV/IP-73 and ATCM XXV/IP74. In addition, ATCM XIX Resolution 5 (1995) Antarctic Treaty Inspection Checklists is also provided to the appointed observer. IAATO vessels have been carrying observers since 1991. 

13	With Thanks -- Cooperation with National Programs

The following provided assistance and operational guidelines to IAATO during the 2004-2005 season, for which Members are grateful:

    • To ALL Antarctic and sub-Antarctic station and island personnel who have welcomed our groups and provided a friendly, educational and rewarding experiences for tourists,

					Appendix B

Expedition Leader and Ship’s Officers
Seasonal Instructions-2004-2005 Season
(August 1, 2004 version)


TO:     All IAATO Office Representatives, Antarctic Captains, Expedition Leaders and Radio Officers 

The following information is included in order to further guide the exchange of information among vessels, and to assist with co-ordination of itineraries and to facilitate the end of season reporting. Note this plan is subject to change. If a change is required an update will be sent.

Exchange of Itineraries
    • IAATO members agree to exchange itineraries and coordinate schedules. This is a key factor in self-regulation, monitoring of activities and also in effective emergency response.
    • Consult the IAATO schedule to determine which vessels will be in your cruising area. Specific landing sites noted on the schedule are given landing priority as agreed to at the IAATO Annual 15th General Meeting, 2004. Expedition Leaders were asked to input day to day itineraries prior to the season. The final IAATO schedule that will be issued in October 2004 will have landing priorities.  Any other changes or updates after this need to be done directly between the vessels.
    • Itineraries must be communicated between vessels directly and not rely on corporate offices once the season begins.
    • Be sure to also exchange environmental information and management recommendations for individual landing sites or other notices with your colleagues as the season progresses.
    • Once again, a decision was made at the IAATO Annual 15th Meeting, 2004 to not rely on or use the In.Fue.Tur schedule and use only the IAATO schedule as the primary schedule. All Full Members present agreed to this. 

Itinerary Changes
    • If your final itinerary changes, circulate by GMDSS, Telex by broadcast mode or radio or fax. Confirm during Radio Chat time at 1930.  (Please note that few tour vessels have regular real-time exchange of e-mail.) Since all ships are supposed to be equipped with a GMDSS radio station, they should be able to scan a frequency in the 6310 KZ band (24 hrs). By using broadcast mode (one way) ships can send itineraries, ice information and other information as needed. These transmissions will be picked up by all vessels and should be able to print out the incoming message immediately. 
    • To avoid conflicts, notify vessels in the region of any changes in planned itinerary as soon as practicable. 
    • Notification should be by GMDSS radio telex first then INM-C, fax, telex, VHF or HF (see below).
    • Notify any vessel of intention to cancel a landing. Due to itinerary changes, weather, ice etc another vessel would appreciate having an additional landing option.

Landing Priority
    • In general, priority is given to what is listed on the official IAATO schedule. Landing sites were pre- agreed prior to the season and resolved by all companies accordingly.
    • In the event of conflict, expedition leaders should co-ordinate between themselves to determine priority, which is best accomplished through negotiation via HF or VHF. 
    • Please resolve any conflicts equitably. It is assumed that vessels visiting a site with some regularity will give way to a vessel that is not but any number of factors may come into play. 
    • Two vessels are not to land at the same place at the same time and, to avoid any potential environmental impacts, efforts should be made to spread out visits over time.

Station Visits
    • Expedition Leaders must provide 72-hour notice to station leaders of any planned station visit.
    • Follow individual procedures determined by national programs/station leaders.
    • Provide timely notice of cancellation, generally 48 hours in advance.
    • Please include any additional station contact information, standard procedures or incidents involving stations, ships or government personnel in your voyage report to the home office.

Station Guidelines for Palmer,  Rothera, Signy and Port Lockroy, Base A
    • Visits to Palmer Station are not allowed on Sundays and preferably not on Saturdays. All Palmer visits have been prearranged. Any changes, please advise Palmer as soon as possible. There is an official Palmer Station schedule issued each season. Provide Palmer Station with 72 hours notice even though you have a prearranged visit. See Palmer Station Guidelines for further information. 
    • Visits to British Stations (Rothera, Signy, Halley) have also been pre-arranged as per procedures by British Antarctic Survey.
    • Port Lockroy: Base A has a specific visitation policy and site-specific guidelines provided by British Antarctic Survey. Please read these guidelines carefully.

Channel 16
    • Channel 16 is used for hailing purposes only, NOT general communication.
    • After making contact, immediately switch to another channel to continue conversation.
    • Expedition Leaders should periodically review radio etiquette with staff. The airwaves during the height of the season in the Peninsula have been crowded, which is an issue with IAATO members and potentially with research stations. Take care to follow standard international procedures.

IAATO Radio Schedule 
    • IAATO members have agreed to implement a once daily radio schedule at 1930.
    • Suggested HF hailing frequencies are: 4146 (1), 6224 (2)-SSB, 8294 (3), to be finalized by radio officers during the season based on experience. Use 6224 whenever possible.
    • Expedition leaders and or an appointed staff member should make use of this schedule whenever VHF communication is impossible for exchange information. This will reduce communication costs.
    • Switch to another frequency for any extended conversation when talking on the above-mentioned HF (4146, 6224).
    • Avoid long conversations over the radio if possible.
    • Protocol for the 1930 chat time: All parties wanting to sort out schedules should make themselves known. Sort all itinerary business first and reschedule any other discussions for a later time. Anyone who simply wants to “chat” should find another time and frequency. ELs not available to talk at this time should appoint another individual to monitor in case a ship is trying to reach you.
    • It is extremely important to not chatter on HF. In years past many EL’s or staff simply did not listen to the chat channel because there were too many lengthy conversations. This channel must be open at 1930 for vessel scheduling and for communication of emergency situations. Again, if you need or want to chat longer, establish a different time and frequency.
    • Vessels equipped with HF-Tlx should scan 6310.0 Khz TX/RX 24 hours. 

Radio Log On, GMDSS Communication
    • Each vessel should report the noon position (Ushuaia local time for the Peninsula Region) to each other via GMDSS radio telex or INM-C. Each radio officer should record this information.  
    • IAATO Radio Log On: At the beginning of the season, ships should use the Radio Log Form and sign off when they have established contact with a specific ship. At the end of the season, the Log should be sent to IAATO together with all the Post Visit Site Reports for evaluation. 
    • GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress Safety System) is the only reliable means of communication and it should be used daily by all ships.
    • Since not all ships are equipped with GMDSS for all coverage, A1, A2, A3 and A4, ships without full coverage can only reliably communicate via INMARSAT-C. Therefore it is important for each ship to pre-establish by what means they will be communicating with each other. The INM-C and the pre-established GMDSS radio telex frequency will allow ships to share information daily. In an emergency, it is the only reliable means of communication. 
    • For additional information reference the agreed IAATO Wide Emergency Contingency Planning Agreement, 14th General Meeting, 2003 and ATCM XXVI Information Paper 69 on Contingency Planning.

EMER (Emergency and Medical Evacuation Response)
    • Review the IAATO Emergency Contingency Plan included in your briefing package. 
    • The reporting scheme indicated above is an integral part of emergency response. Please ensure that it is followed and report any difficulties to your home office.

Post-Visit Reporting
The Process
    • Following Antarctic Treaty recommendations, complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the standard Post-Visit Site Report for every expedition. The 2004-2005 version of the form should be the ONLY form completed for Antarctica. At the end of each voyage return the form and a computer disc to the home office. It is preferable that the form is emailed to IAATO and US NSF after each trip; however some companies prefer to review the forms first. It is therefore the company’s responsibility to forward the form as soon as possible to IAATO and NSF and not wait until the end of the season.  Email to iaato@iaato.org and to nkennedy@nsf.gov.
    • Always submit a computer version and hard copy of each form. Information gleaned from this form is tabulated and circulated internationally by the National Science Foundation, USA and by IAATO in the form of statistics and input into the tourism database. IAATO recommends that the Ship, individual EL’s and each home office keep copies of each Post Visit Site Report. In.Fue.Tur in Ushuaia also requests a copy of this form in order for them to compile their tourism information.
    • EL’s, please note that this information is used for tourism statistics that are tabled worldwide. Please do not hastily fill this out. If you have questions, consult your home office. 
    • We cannot accept hand written forms. All forms must be typed and on the official EXCEL format. If the form is not compatible with the computers on board ship notify your company representative immediately.
    • Do not wait until the end of the season to send forms to IAATO and NSF and to your national authority. Due to the increased number of vessels during the season we need the reports periodically throughout the season.

The Standard Post Visit Site Report Form
    • The form is in EXCEL Format. Drop down menus have been created to make it easier for all concerned. Spend some time learning how to fill the form out on the computer. The form does not need an original signature. EL’s can type their name directly on the form.
    • Do not include South Georgia or any other landing site outside of the Antarctic Treaty Area or north of 60ºS landing site information on this form.  There is a separate form for South Georgia.
    • Please note guests of the company, guest lecturers, and other “non-revenue passengers” should be reported as passengers for the purposes of this report unless they have specific staff roles ashore. In general, those responsible for supervising passenger operations ashore that report to the expedition leader are considered staff. Hotel staff, catering, chefs and deckhands are included as crew members, not staff, unless they are guiding tourists ashore and in Zodiacs.
    • The standard list of “Antarctic Peninsula Region Landing Sites” and any new sites visited during the 2003-2004 season for Part 2 have been incorporated into the drop down menus. If those sites are not included then please note them as new sites and we’ll add them to the list next year. Please correct duplications or inconsistencies. In general, the most specific place name is used. Most all the landing sites are in the drop down menus. For new sites, type in the name of the site, latitude and longitude at the bottom. It may mean that your list of landing sites will not be in chronological date order. Make additions to the list of landing sites as necessary.  
    • Do NOT add additional rows to either the nationalities or to the sites -- use a separate sheet if you don’t have enough space. 
    • Record one line item per each activity. For example, if at one site you are conducting multiple activities (boat landing, scuba driving, kayaking etc, make sure each activity is recorded separately). For example if 10 people are kayaking while 80 people are ashore, make sure your report reflects that.
    • The 2004-2005 form will be completed prior to the start of the season and there will be additional instructions provided by our computer advisor at that time. 
    • It is important to fill out these forms correctly otherwise they will not import into the database



End of Season Reports
    • At the end of the season each company is responsible for providing IAATO with a final report. 
    • Assure that both an electronic copy and hard copy of the Post Visit Site Report Forms are correct and have been sent to IAATO and NSF and your national authority. 
    • Science Assist and Transport: Provide information on the number, nationality of each scientist or group and the destination to where the transport occurred
    • List any donations or funds raised on board for environmental or cultural causes (i.e. Save the Albatross, Bird Life International, Orca Project, Antarctic Heritage Trust, Scott Polar Research Institute, Allied Whale Campaign etc.).  List to whom it was sent and the dollar, Euro etc amount sent. All this information is incorporated into IAATO’s annual report. For detailed information see ATCM XXVII IP 68, IAATO Annual Report.
    • Report any significant environmental impacts or changes that the officers, expedition staff noticed during the season
    • Report any type of problem with any Non- IAATO Member or Scientific Vessel or their passengers. If digital pictures are available please include. 
    • Submit the required incident report form to IAATO if there had been a problem. Use either the Whale report form or the Incident Report Form.
    • Suggest ways of improving operational logistics and additional methods for minimizing environmental and potential cumulative impacts. 

Have a safe and successful Antarctic season and if you have any questions please do not be afraid to ask. 

Enjoy,
Denise Landau
