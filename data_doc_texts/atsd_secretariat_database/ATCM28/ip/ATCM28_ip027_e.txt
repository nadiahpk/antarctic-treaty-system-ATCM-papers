Antarctic Protected Area System:
Reviews of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas 116 and 131 


    1 Introduction

In accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, New Zealand has initiated reviews of the Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 131 (Canada Glacier) and ASPA 116 (New College Valley, Cape Bird).  (The ASPA 131 review was first reported in XXVI ATCM/ WP 31 to CEP VI). This paper provides a brief update on the progress of the reviews.


    2 Review of ASPA 116, New College Valley, Cape Bird, Ross Island

        2.1 Background
SSSI No. 10, Caughley Beach and SPA No. 20, New College Valley at Cape Bird were originally designated in 1985 on the grounds that these areas contained some of the richest stands of mosses and associated microflora and fauna in the Ross Sea region.  In 2000 the Management Plans were revised and the two sites consolidated into a single Area with a restricted zone.

        2.2 Activity in ASPA 116 since last revision
The ASPA has had very little visitation since the last Management Plan revision (2000).  Permits for entry were issued by the United States in 2003 and 2004 for photography of the adjacent penguin colony, and in 2000 and 2002 by New Zealand for management-related visits.

        2.3 Issues raised
Considerable discussion amongst New Zealand and United States scientists, support staff and helicopter pilots has taken place in recent years regarding environmental and operational issues in the general Cape Bird vicinity.  To date, the review of ASPA 116 has therefore focused on those issues already raised which relate to the Area.  

One concern is that helicopter overflight restrictions add to the difficulties of the designated landing site, which is situated on a narrow beach close to an Adélie penguin colony.  A better landing site (in terms of helicopter safety and disturbance to penguins) has been identified, but falls within the ASPA.  

A further problem encountered with the ASPA is that the only clean snow readily available for water making late in the summer season tends to exist within the ASPA.  The Management Plan has no provision for entry for this purpose and events without permits for ASPA 116 regularly stay at the nearby New Zealand hut.  

Although more detailed work is still required, it is also clear that sites with richer vegetation than Cape Bird have been identified and studied in the region since SSSI 10 and SPA 20 were designated, some of which are now also ASPAs (e.g. ASPA 131, Canada Glacier and ASPA 154, Botany Bay).  Further attention needs to be given to the significance of this site in light of current knowledge and the protection afforded by other ASPAs.

        2.4 Proposed actions
Further research and consultation is needed to ascertain whether the values that formed the basis of the original designation are still valid, and whether any other values warrant protection.  Fieldwork will also be carried out as necessary in 2005/06, to answer these questions and survey the proposed helicopter landing site and any revised boundaries that may be identified as the review continues.


    3 Review of ASPA 131, Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Victoria Land

        3.1 Background
An area containing some of the richest vegetation in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region, known as the Canada Glacier flush, was designated as SSSI 12 in 1985 (Resolution XIII-8).  The site’s Management Plan was revised into Annex V format in 1997.  A five-year review was initiated in January 2003 with a site inspection by Antarctica New Zealand’s Environmental Assistant.  This paper documents the issues raised in the visit, during consultation with researchers who use the Area and in relevant records and publications.

        3.2 Activity in ASPA 131 since last revision
The tables below outline the permits that have been issued by the US and New Zealand Antarctic programmes for entry to ASPA 131.  In addition to these activities, an inadvertent un-permitted entry was made by New Zealand arts and education visitors (3 personnel total) in 2002/03. Action to prevent any recurrence was taken by Antarctica New Zealand.

Permit #
Purpose
99-014
Enter Antarctic Specially Protected Areas to film scientific projects in the field for educational purposes.  Access to sites on an opportunistic basis and under constant supervision and direction.

2000-008
Access ASPA to provide maintenance on the continuously recording stream gage and collect water quality samples as part of a Long Term Ecological Research program.  The extensive microbial mats and mosses growing in the Canada stream are unique compared to other areas in the Dry Valleys.  The stream gage on the Canada stream provides one of the longest records of discharge in the Taylor Valley.

2000-024
Collect cyanobacterial assemblages from the lake ice cover to examine the physiological responses and community structures that are selected by the ice-cover environment.


Publications resulting from work in and around the Area since the Management Plan was last revised are listed in the references.  Research has included hydrology, glaciology, chemistry, botany and genetics.  

        3.3 Issues raised
Consultation with New Zealand researchers familiar with the area identified the following issues:

    1. Visitor information
    • Adequate signage is needed at the Area’s boundaries, particularly at key entry points such as the helicopter landing site and foot paths. The cairn marking the NE boundary corner (described in the plan) appears not to have been placed.
    • Documentation showing ASPAs should be provided to all Dry Valleys visitors. (This has been progressed since designation of ASMA 2, McMurdo Dry Valleys).

    2. Management Plan and maps
    • Section 6(i), para 4, line 8 should also include Prasiola calophylla, which occurs in dense ribbons on the underside of stones.
    • The boundary description in section 6 should be re-ordered as one would walk it.
    • Maps should include a large scale of the flush showing vegetation zones.  This should indicate the salt encrusted vegetation referred to in the plan text.
    • Part of the boundary followed the glacier wall – this is dynamic and needs to be resurveyed.

    3. Management measures
    • Sites of past damage need clear marking and recording so they are known to future researchers and systematic monitoring of their recovery can be undertaken.
    • A restricted zone could be established to include representative examples of all vegetation types, in which sampling does not take place.  This could allow recovery of already damaged areas to be accurately monitored.
    • An assessment should be undertaken as to whether there are other glacier snouts with wetland communities which should also be protected, or which should be managed in a collective manner with this one.

        3.4 Proposed actions
The values of the site, namely rich bryophyte and algal growth and its interest to science, remain.  Further investigation as to how this site relates to other glacier snout floral and algal communities, particularly in the context of the designation of ASMA 2, McMurdo Dry Valleys, will be undertaken over the coming year.  In addition, a programme of fieldwork in 2005/06 is proposed to:
    • accurately survey vegetation zones and past sites of activity (hut sites, areas damaged by past sampling);
    • relocate, re-measure and re-photograph disturbed sites as part of a formalised programme of monitoring to assess recovery of these sites; and
    • install signage at key boundary points.

The intention is to submit a revised Management Plan including new maps to CEP IX in 2006.
