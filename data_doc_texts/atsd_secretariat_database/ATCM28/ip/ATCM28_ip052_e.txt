One of the main concerns of the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute is to develop an Environmental Monitoring Program which is cost-effective and practical, given the imperant conditions in Antarctica. An initial Monitoring Program was originally developed and implemented based on the recomendations that arose from the Texas Workshop on Monitoring of Environmental Impacts from Science and Operations in Antarctica, held in 1996. The Program thus created included monitoring of both physical and chemical variables.
More recently, a group of biologists has been incorporated to the team responsible for the development and implementation of the monitoring activities, and therefore Uruguay is currently on its way to include the use of organisms as biological indicators of contamination in the preexisting Program. The aim of this new, more comprehensive Monitoring Program is to optimize the resources of the Environmental Area of the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute, avoiding duplication of efforts, and directing specific monitoring activities to assess the different forms of fortuitous human impact which might result from the activities in and near the Base. 
The biological approach of the Program being developed involves basically the application of standard procedures which have been proven useful in temperate climates, but it also contemplates the evaluation of autoctonous organisms as potential indicators of contamination. In the near future, it will also involve the determination of the trigger level for each biological indicator, and the development of mitigation measures to be applied if a problem is detected.
From our perspective, in order to implement a scientifically sound, cost-effective Monitoring Program which includes the use of organisms as indicators of contamination, it is essential to know first the specific and sometimes unique characteristics of a given Base and its surroundings, and to evaluate the particular environmental disturbances that may arise as a result of its functioning. Once this step is fulfilled, the Biological approach of the Monitoring Program should be designed in such a way that only those environmental variables susceptible to be affected by the potential disturbances are monitored, using indicators carefully chosen on the basis of their capacity to give reliable information and the practicity of their monitoring for the area in question, keeping in mind that biological indicators will not always be the best choice. Below we give a brief summary of the approach that the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute is undertaking to the use of biological indicators of contamination.
Firstly, a revision of the Initial Environmental Evaluation was made in the “Artigas” Base and its immediate surroundings, to evaluate the state of the environment and to identify areas susceptible to different kinds and levels of impact as a consequence of the Base activities. The results of this evaluation are summarized in the Environmental Revision of the Antarctic Scientific Base “Artigas”. As a result of this evaluation, the area to be monitored was defined and divided in seven sectors according to their environmental attributes, and the potential human impact on the different components of the ecosystem (Fig. 1):


    • Sector 1 corresponds mainly to high lands (40-50 m over sea level) with steep slopes, covered by snow and ice during most part of the year except in summer, when a medium level of vegetal coberture can be seen, dominated by lichens of the genus Usnea. In this area some isolated skuas (Catharacta spp.) and kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) can be seen, but no active nests are present.

    • Sector 2 are lower lands (20-30 m over sea level), characterized by the presence of water bodies of considerable dimensions and the sources of creeks originated by melting of ice and snow in the higher areas and the margin of the Collins glacier. This area has some active nests of skuas and medium vegetal cover. The northeastern portion of this sector corresponds to the morrains of the Collins Glacier.
    • Sector 3 includes the lake Uruguay, which is one of the two largest water bodies in the Fildes Peninsula. Even when its surface remains frozen most of the year, it never freezes completely, and therefore it constitutes an excelent water reservoir for the Base. The scarse flora in the sector is mainly found in the rocky area surrounding the lake. Different species of marine birds can be found in this area, but no active nests have been recorded. 
    • Sector 4 encompasses a high area (40-50 m over sea level) corresponding to the Suffield Peninsula, separated from a lower sector (0 to 10 m over sea level) by a cliff. The higher zone is almost entirely covered by the vegetal community, but no active nesting sites have been found. In the lower area the vegetal coberture is also important, and here there is a reproductive colony with approximately 1000 active nests of Wilson petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) and about 20 active nests of Black-bellied Storm-Petrel (Fregetta tropica). This colony has been monitored during the past five years.
    • Sector 5 is the area of strict influence of the “Artigas” Base. This area is traversed by two creeks which receive melting water from the higher regions near the Base, and which are a potential vector for the transport of contaminants derived from the Base activities. There is a low level of vegetal coberture with patched distribution, and there is no permanent animal community in this sector, with only occasional reports of marine mammals and birds during the summer, mainly Pygoscelis penguins.
    • Sector 6 is environmentally similar to Sector 5, but is located to the northeast of the Base, and therefore is not under its direct influence. The northeast portion of this area is covered by the morrains of the Collins Glacier, whose area presents annual variations.
    • Sector 7 corresponds to the coastal region of the Collins Bay. The sediment is heterogeneus, presenting variable granulometry. The rocky sediment is almost entirelly covered by macrophytes. The animal community is constituted mainly by benthic invertebrates, which have been found in both the subtidal and intertidal areas.

After this evaluation was complete, the potential sources of human impact which might derive from the activities of the “Artigas” Base were identified for each of the Sectors mentioned above. The potential disturbances are listed in the Revision of the Initial Environmental Evaluation of the Antarctic Scientific Base “Artigas”, and they can be summarized as follows:

    • Emission of gases and particulated matter. There are localized sources in the Base, with vehicles being additional sources. The dispersion of most part of these contaminants is thus determined in great measure by the dominant winds in the area of the Base, plus a minor dispersion generated by the vehicles. Therefore, all the previously defined Sectors are susceptible to this kind of contamination to some degree, and the highest incidence should be found in Sector 5.
    • Hydrocarbon spills. In case of accidents during handling or storage of fuel, a direct input of hydrocarbons into the environment might occur. This could affect different areas depending on the source of the problem. The main potential points of spillage are: (a) the sea and adjacent coast near the  tanks of fuel, which is the area where fuel is transferred from the ship ROU Vanguardia to its main storage tank; (b) along the road connecting the main storage tank with the Base; (c) Sector 5 of the area of the Base, where secondary storage tanks are kept. The Uruguayan Antarctic Institute has elaborated a contingency plan in case such accidents should occur, which includes the preventive measures and mitigating actions to be taken, as well as monitoring activities to be implemented for the evaluation of the magnitude and consequences of the possible spillage.
    • Solid wastes. All inorganic solid wastes derived from the functioning and maintenance of the Base, as well as residues from the incineration of all organic compounds, are stored in proper containers on a delimited open space in such a way that no dispersion is possible until their annual remotion in the ship ROU Vanguardia, which transports them back to Uruguay. Therefore, besides an aesthetic impact, the only disturbance is confined to the storage area, in Sector 5.
    • Liquid wastes. These can be divided in: (a) wastewater (Group I residues), and (b) lubricants, paints and other chemical products commonly used for maintenance activities (Group II residues). Group II residues are stored in closed containers and kept in the area of storage for solid wastes, from where they are removed from the Base annualy with the latter. The only risk of contamination with these substances is therefore in the eventuality of a spillage or by accidents during their manipulation. In these cases the residues would be released to the environment in Sector 5, and might reach Sector 7 through pluvial runoff. Group I residues are directed to septic tanks; the mud resulting from the decantation process is removed once a year and stored with Group I residues for its posterior remotion from the Base. Residual waters and liquid domestic residues, once treated by decantation, are discharged into the sea in Sector 5. Considering that the average number of people in the Base is less than 30 during the summer (actually this average is less than 15 for Base Artigas) and 8 during the rest of the year, the input of contaminants to the sea is considered to be less than minimal and transitory. However, in case of a structural failure in the septic tanks, and/or if the soil surrounding them gets saturated with organic matter, there is a possibility that the nearby soil, and surface and subsurface waters could be affected, raising the possibility of the spread of human pathogens and other microorganisms associated with humans. Due to the characteristics of the area, if this should happen the Sectors most likely to be affected would be 5 and 7. 
    • Heat. There are different sources of heat from the different activities in the Base and its vehicles, although the incidence of the latter can be neglected. However, the rapid diffusion of heat due to the imperant climatic conditions makes this impact very low.
    • Noise. The main source of noise in Sector 5 are the engines of the generators, but given the scarse presence of fauna in this area, the impact is considered to be less than minimal. Vehicles represent an additional source of noise. Even though the noise intensity is lower, in this case the impact could be higher if the vehicles would transit areas with permanent fauna, in particular breeding or nesting areas, given that the temporal fleeing of the adults because of the noise might leave the offspring more susceptible to predators. This has been addressed by using only predetermined paths which do not cross areas with permanent fauna.
    • Mechanical impact and installations. Almost all mechanical actions on the substrate are the result of vehicle traffic; this impact is maximum in Sector 5, and diminishes as one moves away from the Base. For this purpose, there are specific paths for circulation of all vehicles. The constructions may have a low impact altering the draining patterns.

Once the specific problems were identified for the areas of interest, the next step was to choose appropiate indicators of contamination. We have chosen the following indicators, based on previous experiences in temperate climates, and on the fact that their monitoring can be easily implemented in the Base “Artigas” with our resources:

    • Emission of gases and particulated matter. These should be monitored in all seven Sectors in which the area of influence of the “Artigas” Base was divided. The biological indicators chosen were:
        ◦ Usnea spp. Given their capacity to accumulate heavy metals in their cells, these lichens have been proven useful to detect these contaminants in the environment. Their presence in Sectors 1-6 allows for their sampling in almost the whole area of interest.
        ◦ Marine limpets. These gastropods are known to accumulate these contaminants in their tissues, and are abundant in the tidal area in Sector 7, where lichens are absent.
    • Hydrocarbons. These should be monitored along the road in Sector 3, and in Sectors 5 and 7. 
        ◦ To monitor petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the soil along the road in Sector 3, and in Sector 5, a chemical approach will be used, given that to the best of our knowledge there are no practical biological indicators of this kind of contamination in the soil of the area of interest. The same criterium will be applied to the study of the sediment of the Uruguay lake; it is likely to be affected because of its proximity to the road, and, unlike the soil samples, the sediment can give a historical record of changes in these parameters.
        ◦ Marine limpets. In Sector 7, they can also be used to detect aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons accumulated in their tissues. 
        ◦ The structure of the community of intertidal platyhelminths and oligochaetes will be studied, in order to evaluate whether these invertebrates can be useful as biological indicators of this kind of contamination. 
    • Liquid wastes. 
        ◦ Group II residues should be monitored in Sectors 5 and 7. 
            ▪ Marine limpets can be used in Sector 7 to look for anthropogenic organochlorine compounds in their tissues, as well as the pollutants mentioned above.
            ▪ Given the lack of practical biological indicators, a chemical approach seems more feasible for the monitoring of Group II residues in Sector 5.
        ◦ Group I residues should also be monitored in Sectors 5 and 7. 
            ▪ In order to evaluate the amount of organic matter in the water, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, pH and conductivity can be monitored in the creeks in Sector 5 and seawater in Sector 7. 
            ▪ Faecal contamination of soil and water can be monitored using faecal coliforms, total coliforms and streptococci in Sector 5 and in seawater in Sector 7. Sector 3, including Lake Uruguay (the water reservoir of the Base), is not susceptible to human fecal contamination due to its location, but it is susceptible to contamination by birds, so it is also sampled for these organisms.
            ▪ The structure of the community of intertidal platyhelminths and oligochaetes will be studied, in order to evaluate whether these invertebrates can be useful as biological indicators of organic contamination. 
    • Heat and installations. In Sector 5, a study will be conducted to evaluate whether the slightly higher temperature and more stable conditions generated below the wannigans (i) alter the normal development of the autoctonous fauna and flora, and (ii) if this conditions favour the establishment of aloctonous fauna and flora which would not prosper under natural conditions.
