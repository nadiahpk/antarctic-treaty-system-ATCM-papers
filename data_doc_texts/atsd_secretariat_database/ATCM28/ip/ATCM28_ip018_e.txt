Report by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) on “Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters”


Introduction

I would like to take this opportunity, to thank the authorities of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) for having invited the IHO.  Once again the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is honoured to report to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) on the Cooperation in Hydrographic Surveying and Charting of Antarctic Waters. This report covers the period between the XXVIIth and XXVIII ATCMs.  . 

IHO Member States are well aware of their responsibility to improve safety of life at sea, safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment in Antarctica. The coordination to facilitate National Hydrographic Services to provide updated and reliable hydro-cartographic products is executed by the Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica, a committee that meets once a year to keep track on these efforts.    

The recommendations the IHO submitted to the XXVIIth ATCM in Cape Town last year were fully endorsed. This expression of support has been very well received by the IHO, specially by its Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica.


The IHO Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica

We would like to provide a brief report on the work done by the Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica (HCA) that met in September 2004. Amongst other technical topics, the following issues were discussed: 

    a) the progress made in the scheming and production of international (INT) Charts; 
    b) the setting up of a Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group; 
    c) the need to get some guidance on the establishment of terrestrial Aids to Navigation in Antarctica;  
    d) the need to keep updated the IHO S-55 Publication “Worldwide Status of Hydrographic Surveying and Nautical Charting” and 
    e) cooperation with other international organizations.   

As regard to the INT Chart production, out of 91 INT charts contained in the cartographic scheme, 45 have already been published (see Annex A). That means that there has been an approximate 50% increase since last year. Some of these charts, over 5, are already also available as electronic charts (ENC).  

When preparing this report I recall that during the last ATCM I was requested to indicate when the complete cartographic scheme would be ready, and really that is a very difficult question to answer in the light of the growing new requirements. The HCA received a very interesting proposal from IAATO, for the inclusion of 11 new INT charts in the IHO INT chart scheme for the Antarctic Peninsula. These new charts would cover areas of great tourism interest and will facilitate safer operations. The HCA is considering the request and has become aware that requests for new additions cannot be ignored. After the subject is studied, the HCA will identify the MS responsible for the production of the newly accepted charts.  

The idea to set up a Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group (HSPWG) has its roots on the need to improve effectiveness by establishing priorities. As a secondary benefit, the outcome could provide an indication to MS willing and aiming to take advantage of the International Polar Year (2008-2009) to orient their efforts on concrete needs. More information is provided below, under a special paragraph on the objectives and progress made by the HSPWG. 

Proposals to establish terrestrial Aids to Navigation (AtNs) in Antarctica, where there exists potential risk for navigation, were offered by COMNAP. As a result, a list of those AtNs which have been recommended so far is maintained on the IHO website (www.iho.shom.fr > Reg Hydro Commissions > HCA). Interestingly, it was suggested that DGPS stations could be set up in the Antarctic Peninsula and that three stations would probably provide reasonable coverage.

The updating and maintenance of IHO Publication S-55  “Worldwide Status of Hydrographic Surveying and Nautical Charting” is considered vital to properly assess the actual situation regarding these two aspects, “surveying” and “charting”, and to monitor its progress thereafter. S-55 consists essentially of a standardized database which is kept on the IHO website, and is updated as MSs provide new entries. This information serves as a useful resource for strategic planning, decision-making and the international coordination of a work program, and will assist in properly prioritising the work to be done. Therefore priority should be assigned to keep this publication updated. 
  
Cooperation with other organizations has significantly improved, and representatives of IAATO, COMNAP, SCAR, IOC and IMO attended the 2004 HCA meeting. 
    • It has to be highlighted that cooperation with IAATO and COMNAP is extremely fruitful. In addition to their contribution to improving the INT Chart Scheme and identifying AtNs in Antarctica, as reported above, IAATO has kindly expressed its willingness to contribute with ships of opportunity to improve the level of hydrographic information gathering. 
    • Additionally, SCAR, IOC and IHO have joined their efforts in sponsoring the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) project, which was launched in July 2004. The intention is to built a 2.5 km grid bathymetric database for all waters south of 60°S.  
    • IHO and IMO continue to cooperate on improving the quality and availability of hydrographic information for operation in remote areas. Further plan are to develop relevant guidelines / requirements by 2006, to ensure the safety of navigation in remote areas and this work will involve a review of availability of international AtNs for vessels operating in remote areas.

Objectives of and Progress made by the HCA Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group (HSPWG)

As mentioned above, the HCA considered that there was a need to develop a hydrographic survey plan for Antarctic waters, taking into consideration the requirements to complete the INT chart scheme. The objectives of HSPWG are the followings:

    1. Establish prioritised HCA Statement of Survey Requirements:

        a. Identify special regional geographical factors e.g. ice cover; significant changes in shelf ice edge; complex bottom topography.
        b. Identify Maritime Shipping Routes and port/site calls and derive usage category (A = frequent; B = regular; C = infrequent), verifying INT chart coverage and availability.
        c. Identify and categorise existing coverage from S-59.
        d. Develop assessment criteria and produce a prioritised statement of areas requiring survey.
        e. Compare national prioritised lists of survey intentions and rolling programmes with the HCA statement.  Provide advice to national hydrographic and marine scientific research programming authorities to avoid duplication and to utilise spare capacity.  Liaise with COMNAP, SCAR and IAATO to utilise ships of opportunity.

    2. Develop guidelines, complementing S-44, for gathering and submitting surveying observations in ships of opportunity1.

    3. Promote and co-ordinate hydrographic activity for maximum output during the International Polar Year (2007-2008) by advocacy for an IPY Hydrographic Initiative:

        a. To develop a scheme for fully surveyed marine corridors in Antarctic Peninsula [and Ross Sea]. 
        b. To seek support of IMO, IOC, ATCM, and IPY Planning Committee.
        c. To develop a plan for survey and charting of marine corridors.
        d. To seek national programming authorities’ cooperation and involvement in implementing the plan.
        e. To identify tasks for ships of opportunity. To include options for states without polar vessels to provide surveyors and equipment.

Progress so far achieved includes:

    • Assessment criteria to prioritise areas requiring surveys mainly around Antarctica, and the identification of maritime shipping routes.
    • A scheme for a main corridor round the Antarctic Peninsula, labelled “Proposed Maritime Shipping Routes” (see Annex B).
    • Development of Guidelines for the collection of hydrographic information by tours vessels (intended for IAATO and COMNAP when finalized).


Conclusions

1.-	There has been good coordination and cooperation between the IHO and other international organizations interested in the Antarctica. The progress made and underway is greatly due to joint efforts. All seems to have a common understanding of the importance of conducting hydrographic surveys and making available reliable nautical charts. These two elements constitute the key factor for executing any activity in Antarctica, and therefore deserves priority.  

2.-	The availability of INT Charts, from 29 last year to 45 nowadays, is a clear indication of the progress achieved so far by the IHO. Nevertheless, the survey of the Antarctic waters cannot be avoided and charts will be available only if Member States allocate resources and priority to do so.  The potential increase in number of INT charts should constitute a warning sign to enhance national priorities and mobilization of resources. 

3.-	The setting up of an HCA Hydrographic Survey Programme Working Group should help identifying the best practice to take advantage of the existing possibilities to foster the INT chart coverage.


Proposal


It is recommended that the XXVIIIth ATCM : 

1.-	Accepts the IHO Report. 

2.-	Acknowledges the progress made in the production of INT charts.    

3.-	Expresses support for the activities the HCA is conducting with its Hydrographic 
Survey Programme Working Group. 

4.-	Considers inviting Members States to increase the hydrographic survey activity in 
 	Antarctica.
