A Review of the Antarctic Protected Areas System
Introduction

In December 2004, New Zealand commissioned a review of the protected area Management Plans currently in use for the 62 protected areas in Antarctica.  The primary purpose for conducting the review was to provide background information to support an up-to-date evaluation of the status of the protected areas system for the CEP’s state of the Antarctic environment reporting (SAER) system.  

However, it was felt that the CEP may welcome sight of the broader findings of the review and a separate Working Paper has therefore been submitted to the CEP.

This Information Paper provides additional information to support the findings reported in the Working Paper.

The data is presented in seven tables as follows:

    • Table 1: Antarctic Specially Protected Areas – Designation and Management Plan Status
    • Table 2: Antarctic Specially Managed Areas – Designation and Management Plan Status
    • Table 3: Proposed Antarctic Specially Protected and Managed Areas
    • Table 4: Primary Annex V Categories for Antarctic Specially Protected Area Designation
Table 5: All Annex V Categories covered by Antarctic Specially Protected Area Designations
    • Table 6: Values protected by Antarctic Specially Protected Areas
    • Table 7: Values protected by Antarctic Specially Managed Areas

Conclusion.

These tables have been compiled based on the most recent versions of the ASPA management plans that are available.  However, New Zealand would welcome feedback on the information provided in these tables, particularly where there are inaccuracies or errors.

Largest relatively ice-free region in Antarctica 30% of ground surface largely free of ice and snow Cold desert ecosystem: cold, extremely arid and windy. Serves as an important analogue for the conditions of ancient Earth and contemporary Mars. Low biodiversity and reduced food web complexity. But realatively diverse habitats as compared to other ice free areas. Long term data sets for environmental observations are some of the longest in Antarctica. A valuable resource for understanding landscape processes and the stability of the Antarctic ice sheets. Unique surface deposits The soil, rock, water and ice environments and their associated biota are of scientific value as model ecosystems that allow deep insights into natural processes operating throughout the biosphere. The species that reside in this area provide a biological resource for understanding adaptionto extreme environments. Valued for their wildernes quality Special geological features and minerals.

A site of historic, archaeological, social and aesthtic value: Numerous relics relating to the work of Mawson's 1911-14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition including Mawson's huts and other significant and relatively untouched artefacts from the 'Heroic Age' The cultural landscape in which Mawson and his men lived and worked, the site provides the physical and symbolic context of the extreme isolation and harsh conditions endured by the early explorers. The wildlife and undisturbed artefacts, and the dramatic backdrop of the Antarctic Plateau represent significant educational values The paucity of relatively ice free areas in the vicinity means that Cape Denison represents an important assemblage of life forms. Breeding area for seals and birds, 13 lichen species, 13 small lakes Opportunities to repeat Mawson's experiments in geology, glaciation, climate, magnetic and biological studies and carry out new studies. Mawson's records provide a dataset against which the results of modern research can be compared.
