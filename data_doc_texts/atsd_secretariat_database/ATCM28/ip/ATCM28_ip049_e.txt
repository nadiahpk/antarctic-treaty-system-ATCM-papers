WASTE WATER TREATMENT IN ANTARCTICA
– a feasibility study for grey water treatment at Wasa station

By Sweden
Introduction
The Swedish Polar Research Secretariat (SPRS) is investigating different techniques for cleaning grey water for the Swedish Antarctic Summer Station Wasa. A survey on wastewater treatment at almost all Antarctic research stations has been carried out in order to find a suitable treatment method for the grey water released from Wasa. The study was made as a master’s thesis and was conducted by Ann Thomsen from the Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial Ecology, Stockholm, Sweden.

Abstract
All twenty eight member states that operate research stations was included and the survey covered 41 permanent stations, 26 summer stations and 4 field stations. The study showed that 26 permanent stations and 8 summer stations had some kind of treatment for their wastewater (see figure 1-4 below). The most common treatment method for the permanent stations are biological treatment (8 stations) followed by secondary treatment and maceration (4 stations per method). The results are based upon analyses from the survey answers and information from COMNAP’s homepage.

Three treatment systems using chemical precipitate or membrane are currently under evaluation for Wasa. The preferred system will be tested in Sweden before the planned installation at Wasa during the season 2006/2007.
