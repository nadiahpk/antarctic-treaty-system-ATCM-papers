Activity of the Russian Federation for preparation and holding of the International Polar Year 2007/08
The Arctic and the Antarctic are the Earth’s regions where not only the geographical meridians converge but also the state interests of many countries even sometimes under the conditions of their significant remoteness from high latitudes. In the modern world, the problems of political, economical, military-strategic, scientific and demographic character are closely interrelated in polar regions. Lately, the problems of nature protection and issues of possible consequences of climatic changes that are of deep concern to mankind were added to them. With respect to the latter problem the Arctic and the Antarctic are being considered not only in terms of typical regions of the formation of weather conditions and the Earth’s climate, but also as the areas most sensitively responding to the global climatic changes. A complex solution of this wide range of problems is possible on condition of close international cooperation with such large events as the First and the Second International Polar Years 1907-08 and 1932-33 and the International Geophysical Year 1957-58 being good examples. Russia as a country with strong polar traditions was an active participant of all these events. In this connection the idea of holding the Third International Polar Year (IPY) (2007-08) was widely supported in this country not only by the scientific community but also by the state power bodies.  

On 19 November 2004, the Government of the Russian Federation issued an order about establishing the national organizing committee for the participation of the Russian Federation in preparation and holding the events in the framework of the Third International Polar Year. It was recommended to the federal bodies of the executive power to provide necessary assistance to the work of the organizing committee. The Committee is comprised of 17 people – representing the machinery of the Russian Federation Government, the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Roshydromet) and other governmental organizations.   

In 2004, preparation of research projects proposed for implementation under the Program of the Third IPY by different research institutions of Russia was completed. A total of 68 projects were proposed, with 36 of them planned for implementing in the Arctic region, 18 – in the Antarctic and 12 having a bi-polar significance. At present, a block of social-demographic studies is being formed separately. The proposed projects aim at addressing the main objectives formulated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).

In accordance with their profile directions of activity, these are for WMO:
    1. Study of current and assessments of future climate changes in polar regions.
    2. Development of scientific bases of forecasting the processes in the atmosphere, ionosphere, cryosphere and marine environment.
    3. Determination of natural and anthropogenic changes in the environment and their impact on polar ecosystems.
In the ICSU formulations they are as follows:
    1. Determination of the current environmental state in polar regions by assessing their spatial and temporal variability. 
    2. Assessment and understanding of environmental and human changes in the past and present in polar regions aiming to improve forecasting. 
    3. More detailed understanding of polar and global interactions by means of investigating relations at different spatial-temporal scales.
    4. Study of unknown aspects in new areas of science for polar regions.
    5. Use of a specific location of polar regions to  develop and improve observatories investigating the Earth’s inner core, Earth’s magnetic field, geo-space, the Sun, etc. and
    6. Studies of cultural, historic and social processes.

In November 2004, these international organizations established the International Polar Year Joint Committee, the most important principles of its work including:
    • Provision of open and timely access to data.
    • Expansion of capabilities of the existing activities.
    • Provision of international access to the field sites for supporting additional scientific and monitoring activity.
    • And some others.

The National IPY Organizing Committee is also guided in its activity by the aforementioned principles. The work of the Committee is performed on the basis of the Provisions adopted at the session of the Committee of 7 April 2005. In compliance with this document, the Committee:
- realizes in the established order cooperation with the international organizations and committees of other countries participating in preparation and undertaking actions in order to solve the problems that are in the terms of reference of the Committee;
- determines the priority directions of scientific studies in polar regions;
- coordinates the programs of scientific studies in polar regions taking into account the international programs;
- undertakes measures for providing support to scientific studies of young Russian scientists on the topics of the events;
- analyzes and controls performance of actions and assesses the social-economic results of participation of the Russian Federation in implementing the events;
- submits to the RF Government the report on the results of participation of the Russian Federation in the events.
     
In 2004, the concept for carrying out the IPY 2007/08 studies was developed in Russia. Russian specialists and scientific organizations have developed and sent to the IPY Joint Committee more than 50 draft proposals for comprehensive investigation of climate of polar areas, their atmosphere, marine environment,  lithosphere, ecosystem and the solution of general methodological and practical issues on organization and upgrading of the existing observation network and preparation of its geodetic and cartographic basis. These proposals are as a rule based on using the existing Russian research infrastructure in the Arctic and the Antarctic and on creation of some of its new components. In some cases the latter means reactivation of earlier closed observation stations on the new modern methodological basis. For marine research both in the high-latitudinal Arctic and in the Southern Ocean, the R/V “Akademik Fedorov” and aircraft will be employed. The operating network of hydrometeorological stations of Russia will become a basis for regular observations aimed at fulfilling research projects. 

In the Arctic Basin, they will be supplemented with studies on the drifting ice by means of manned research “North Pole” stations. The international infrastructure already existing in Russia will be used for organization and implementation of work. These are, in particular the Otto Schmidt Russian-German Laboratory and the Fram Russian-Norwegian Laboratory at the AARI.  

Russian specialists propose to carry out many full-scale studies in cooperation with their foreign partners. Thus, complex high-latitudinal studies of the Arctic Ocean from board the R/V “Akademik Fedorov” can be supplemented by work of research vessels of icebreaking type from other countries. In this case, such studies can become a multi-ship international expedition. Russia invites partners from other countries to participate in this project. Such expedition will allow us to obtain a set of data on the processes and the state of the environment of the most difficult-for-access Arctic area where significant climatic changes take place. 

The Russian “North Pole” drifting stations will be an important research platform in the observation network structure of the high-latitudinal Arctic during the IPY period. Contact studies of surface atmosphere, ice cover and surface ocean layer made from drifting ice rather than from board ship is much more representative, especially in terms of investigating the meso- and micro-structure of the process of sea-air interaction through ice.    

In 2007-08, it is planned to continue complex Russian-German studies of the marine area and the adjoining coastal areas of the Laptev Sea.  These studies are aimed at reconstructing climate and environmental changes of the region for the last 10 kyr. During the IPY, specialists from Sweden will joint this research.

Russia plans to begin realization of an interesting project for investigating paleo-climatic changes of bottom sediments of the Chukchi Lake Elgygytgyn.  Scientists from the USA and Germany also plan to participate in this project.

In the studies of the Barents Sea region, scientists from Norway are traditionally the closest partners for Russia. The oceanographic studies will be supplemented by ground-based climatic observations on Spitsbergen, on Novaya Zemlya and on Franz Josef Land islands. 

Arctic climate changes are manifested in different forms. In the cryosphere in particular, this is a decrease of land glaciation volumes and changes in iceberg activity.   The Russian and Norwegian scientists and the energy companies of two countries show interest in the project on the study of generation and dynamics of icebergs in the Barents Sea, where it is planned to begin gas condensate production (Shtokman gas condensate field project). Icebergs in this region present a serious risk factor for stationary offshore structures.

One of the major directions of the IPY Program is obviously the study of the current state of the social-demographic problem of the indigenous population of the Arctic under the influence of increased economic activity in the region. It is directly connected with the environment and its changes. In the course of the studies, new data on pollutants in the environment, their influence on the ecosystems and man health will be collected.  Demographic data on the state of the indigenous population and other information will help to better understand the role of anthropogenic and natural factors influencing the Arctic residents. 

The aforementioned Russian proposals on the Arctic studies of the IPY program were presented at the session of the Arctic Council, which was held in Yakutsk, Russia from 4 – 8 April, 2005. At present this international body intended for consideration of general issues and problems facing the peoples and the governments of the Arctic region, is under the Russia’s chairmanship.
 	Participation of the Arctic Council in all stages of planning and realization of the IPY 2007/08 is important for achieving the IPY success in the Arctic. 

The Reykjavik Declaration signed by the ministers of foreign affairs of eight arctic states in November last year emphasized that the role of the Arctic Council would consist in providing political grounds for the successful implementation of the IPY 2007-2008 in the Arctic. 

In the Antarctic region, Russian scientists propose a number of projects under the IPY Program aimed to investigate the tendencies of spatial-temporal variability of modern climate characteristics, specific features of the influence of “s olar wind” energy on different geo-and biophysical processes in natural media of the Southern Hemisphere, the sub-glacial Lake Vostok, and the peculiarities of structure of the sub-glacial bedrock relief and the sedimentary mantle of the marginal Antarctic Seas. This work will be performed using the existing infrastructure of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, which will be expanded due to deployment of automatic magneto-variation and meteorological recorders at the earlier closed Russian Antarctic stations Molodezhnaya, Leningradskaya and Russkaya. One of the important directions of Russian Antarctic studies during the IPY will be continuation of drilling activity in the deep borehole at Vostok station. Upon acquisition of the necessary new data on the ice core structure from a depth of more than 3623 m and obtaining the necessary permits from the authorized Russian bodies, penetration to the water column of the lake during the season of 2007-08 with the aim of sampling is possible.  

The National IPY Organizing Committee of Russia has approved the plan of actions for preparation and holding the events in 2007-08. It includes the following sections:
- organization measures;
- development of the methodological grounds and the resource base of the IPY events;
- preparation and undertaking scientific-research and other scientific-technical work during the IPY period.
- preparation and fulfillment of scientific-research work based on the results of full-scale experiments of the IPY;
- preparation and holding of a system of scientific-communication events. 
	
Holding the IPY 2007-2008 will allow a significant development of the observation base for a successful realization of similar programs and assessment of environmental changes for the social-economic complex of the Arctic and address many important contemporary scientific problems in the Antarctic. It will become an important stage of international cooperation and achievement of objectives set by WMO and ICSU in the interests of the world community.
