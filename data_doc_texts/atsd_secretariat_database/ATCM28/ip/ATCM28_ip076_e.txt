ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING OF THE INDIAN PERMANENT STATION-MAITRI IN PURSUANT TO THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING OF THE INDIAN PERMANENT STATION-MAITRI IN PURSUANT TO THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY
Introduction
Each Antarctic Treaty nation is required to report annually about the action taken to implement the Protocol as per the Article 17 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. In accordance with the recommendation XV-5 of the Fifteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative meeting, held in Paris in 1989, there are a series of activities that should be monitored. Through continuous monitoring the environmental change can be observed which would provide valuable benchmark to evaluate the state of Antarctic environment. According to the Protocol on Environmental Protection (article 8 and annex I), environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure has been developed for activities undertaken in the Antarctic. India initiated towards the ratification of Antarctica Treaty and following measures represents the active role;  
    • India admitted to the Antarctic Treaty on August 19, 1983 and soon after obtained a consultative status on September 12, 1983
    • India was admitted as a member of Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) on October 1, 1984.
    • India became the member of Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLER) in 1986.
    • India ratified he Environment Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty in 1997, thus upholding its commitment to preserve the pristine continent
For Madrid Protocol our activities aim at:
    • Implementation of suggested steps in Environmental Management Plan, to minimize the adverse impact to conserve the Antarctic Environment and introduction of Environmental Management System.
    • Providing valuable environmental and technological data, useful for the development national and international research
    • Development of strategy to build cooperation with the research programme of other countries for environmental protection
This paper represents the environmental monitoring conducted at Indian permanent station “Maitri” at Antarctica during the summer period of year 2004-05. As per the recommendation of CEP VII following Terms of Reference considered during monitoring:
    • consider which environmental variables are the best indicators of the assessment of the impacts of human activities in Antarctica, in particular on populations, habitats and other sensitive areas directly, indirectly or cumulatively impacted
    • identify appropriate methodologies for monitoring these indicators
    • identify existing data sets relevant to the indicators
    • develop guidelines on appropriate environmental monitoring that are simple and effective, and can be undertaken by national programs and/or NGOs 
    • consider data management including availability through the pilot SAER system, or the Secretariat, and 
    • provide a report to CEP VIII

Monitoring Programme during Summer Period 2004-05
According to the Monitoring of Environmental Impacts from Science and Operations in Antarctica (SCAR, 1996) the monitoring improvement is carried out. Water/wastewater samples are collected and physico-chemical analysis (pH, temperature, conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, chloride, ammonical nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand carried out. Performance evaluation of biodiscs was done to evaluate the treatment efficiency of biodiscs .Heavy metal analysis like cadmium, copper, chromium, lead, iron and zinc is carried out in the Laboratory at NCAOR, India. In last expedition it is felt to carpet the pond liner where treated wastewater is stored for some period and the process to carpet the liner is already initiated. Water samples from various lakes is collected and analyzed for physicochemical parameters and further for nutrient budget to understand the anthropogenic impact on fresh water bodies of Schirmacher oasis. Aerosol samples are also collected for physico chemical characterization near. Biological samples (Lichen and Moss) in and around the Maitri station are collected to understand the biodiversity there existence and the stress condition if any. A continuous measurement of CO, CO2 and CH4 throughout the year is made using automated gas chromatograph at Maitri. During this year in summer in continuation of earlier expeditions once in a week an environmental cleaning of surrounding of Maitri station is carried out.

 Waste Management
Station has the systems to collect and segregate the waste as per nature of the waste i.e. bio degradable and non-biodegradable. Further biodegradable waste is also segregated as papers, rags and food waste. Paper rags etc are burnt in a closed room by incinerator and ash is collected in the drums similarly the human excreta is incinerated and the ash are collected into the drum and all the solid waste is removed from the Antarctica and bring to country for safe disposal. Around 20 tones of waste/scrap material is collected and removed from the area. The basic aim of these activities to remove the waste from the Antarctica treaty area. 

Fire Fighting Drill
To combat the fire in case of emergency, training on fire fighting technique is given and   fire drill was organized every month during the summer and all the members participated.

Conclusion
The environmental monitoring Programme at the Indian scientific permanent station was started in the year of 1993. At Maitri station, based on the EMP suggested each year by the group of environmental scientist is implemented year-to-year basis, which result into improvement in the quality and aesthetics of the station. Due to collection of the data a significant database is generated for future comparison. Indian team members are working also in close cooperation with other country i.e. Peru, Germany, Iran, France, Russia, South Africa and Malaysia. The analysis of data does not show the significant change in environmental indicator. Regular monitoring activity is continue in order to keep under control any negative impact on the Antarctic environment, surrounding to the Maitri station. An environmental lab is setup in the station Maitri (to analyze basic parameters) and at National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean research (a nodal agency of India to undertake, organize and coordinate Antarctic Scientific Programme), which is a major step towards environmental monitoring Programme and which will be strengthened further in coming expeditions.
